A group of inspiring women in their fifties are proving it's never too late to get fit by embarking on a workout programme that involves weight lifting and high intensity exercise. Hazel Ponsford, Lorraine Hadris, Sue Jones, and Kim Ivory are all age 53 and admit they have never been fitter than they are now. From running marathons to becoming models and changing careers, the women admit exercising has given them the confidence to do things they never believed they were capable of before. Self-esteem boost: Hazel Ponsford always hated having her picture taken but a fitness regime gave her the confidence to become a model . Hazel, from Berkshire, told MailOnline she wanted to get fit at the age of 50 in order 'to be healthy as I entered a new phase of life.' However, she never expected her fitness journey to end in a new career and a stint as a model. The former HR manager signed up for a fitness programme with personal trainer Julia Buckley. Julia advocates high intensity exercise that can be done in the home and encourages people to lift weights to tone up and burn fat. Hazel admits she loved the new challenge and coupled her exercise regime with Julia's healthy eating advice to limit processed foods, dairy and sugar. Look at me now: Hazel, 53, demonstrates moves using an exercise ball in the Bloomsbury published book The Fat Burn Revolution . Fit and strong at 50: Hazel got into shape following author Julia Buckley's advice . However, one aspect she disliked was the requirement to take before and after pictures in her underwear so she could track her progress and changing body shape. 'I have never liked having my photograph taken so that was not the easiest thing to do,' she admitted. Hazel had never been overweight but by following Julia's plan, she became stronger and gained a trimmer, leaner body. She said: 'Itâ€™s hard to see changes in yourself, but it wasn't long before my old clothes didn't fit, telling me that an improvement had been made.' She also began to grow in confidence and having her picture taken no longer seemed quite so abhorrent. When Julia was commissioned to turn her weightloss programme into a book published by Bloomsbury called The Fat Burn Revolution, Hazel had the opportunity to prove just how far she had come. New lease of life: Hazel never thought she would become a fitness model and has now qualified as a personal trainer . She explained: 'In May 2013, came a totally . unexpected request from Julia - would I be one of the models in her . book? Wow! What a request. I didn't allow myself time to think and . immediately agreed. 'I can't in all honestly say that I was looking . forward to the photoshoot but at no stage did I regret this decision.' Hazel features in a number of chapters of the book demonstrating the various moves using dumbbells and an exercise ball. She said: 'I can't believe at the age of 53 I can add ""fitness model"" to my c.v.' she said. Her new found confidence and love of exercise has also led to her taking a new career path and she has qualified to be a personal trainer and pilates instructor. Fitter than ever: Lorraine, 53, completed a tough military-style obstacle race last year . Lorraine, from Oxfordshire, has also found a new lease of life and improved body tone after joining the Fat Burn Revolution. She said: 'My body was a bit lumpy and bumpy and I resigned myself that at 53 this was the best I could be. 'Bread and cakes were my downfall and a lung condition gave me an excuse not too work out and feel sorry for myself. I found it too intimidating to go the the gym so when I heard I could do Julia's programme at home it appealed to me. I joined the Facebook group and having that support and encouragement made me stick with it.' Lorraine took 17cm off her waist after taking up the programme and the symptoms of her lung condition abated. 'I am definitely now smaller and fitter than I was 20 years ago,' she said. Last year she also took part in a muddy obstacle race - The Major - with other people she met through the Fat Burn Revolution. She said: 'I would never ever done this without this programme and now want to do more.' Kim, from Leighton Buzzard, was another of the Fat Burn Revolutionaries to take part in The Major race. She has also completed the London Marathon since turning 50 and has loved taking up weight lifting. She said: 'I had never been interested in weights before. I've always had the flimsiest arms and really had no arm strength at all. I didn't think I would be able to lift them.' But Julia advised her to try weighting lifts because she explains: 'Adding muscle not only gives your body a firmer, more attractive shape, it improves athletic performance, reduces injury risk, aids mobility and agility, reduces aches and pains, brings a huge range of health benefits and of course makes you strong.' After starting with the lowest weight dumbbells, Kim's strength increased and she now lifts 8.5kg. She recommends other women try weight lifting - whatever their age - and that they shouldn't be concerned about becoming too bulky. She said: 'If you haven't tried weights, give it a go. You can start at the lowest of dumbbells like I did. You simply don't get big muscles. What you get is toned and stronger, and you can eat more because muscle burns more calories than fat. From 'couch potato' to super woman: Kim Ivory has toned up by lifting weights and ran a marathon after turning 50 . 'I would say that I am fitter than 20 years ago.  Back then although I was very skinny, I had no tone or aerobic fitness. Now, I would say that I pretty fit for my age.' She added: 'It's never too late to get fit. I was a complete couch potato until I was 48 and started running. I couldn't run for more than 15 seconds at a time then, but three years later I completed the London Marathon. 'I feel pretty body confident now and I can still wear a bikini. I am pretty proud of myself for not ""letting it all go"".' Sue, a film editor from Cardiff, has dropped 5st since turning 50 and starting to work out following Julia's advice. She can now give her two grown up sons a run for their money doing sit ups and press ups. She said: 'I used to eat too much. Wine with dinner were unused calories and had become a daily habit. I was amazed at quite how out of shape I was at the beginning of the 12 week programme. 'Now I am a lot fitter, my energy levels now are fantastic.' She admits that she was wary of lifting weights at first, especially as the free weights areas of gyms always seemed to be 'men only.' She explained: 'The main worry is looking like a male weight lifter, but I learnt that really isn't going to happen unless you take it to extremes and take supplements. The only outcome you will get are lovely toned muscles. 'I invested in a good set of weights so I could use them every day in the privacy of my own home, my weights collection has grown and grown. I even have a pull up bar on the door now.' She added that she hopes she and her other '53 Club' members of the Fat Burn Revolution can inspire other women to get into shape and not be afraid to pump iron. 'It's never too late in life to try anything, and 50 is nothing these days,' she said. 'I want to stay as mobile, strong and mentally alert for as long as I can, that means investing some time now.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:03 EST, 4 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:41 EST, 4 February 2014 . Capital murder defendant Suzanne Basso is expected to be executed in Texas Wednesday for the brutal 1998 slaying of a mentally disabled man, becoming only the 14th woman to be put to death since 1976. Basso was convicted in 1999 of leading a group of thugs in torturing and killing Louis 'Buddy' Musso, 59, so they could cash his life insurance policy. Basso's lawyer argued that the 59-year-old woman is not mentally competent enough to face execution because she suffers from delusions, and that the state statute governing competency was unconstitutionally flawed. He also challenged the legality of a medical examiner's testimony. Justice for Buddy: Suzanne Basso (left), 59,  is scheduled to die for the 1998 torture slaying of Louis 'Buddy' Musso (right), a 59-year-old mentally impaired man with the intellect of a 7-year-old, near Houston . A state judge last month ruled that Basso had a history of fabricating stories about herself, sought attention and manipulated psychological tests. ‘She would pretend to be different things,’ recalled Colleen Barnett, who prosecuted Basso. ‘One setting she would pretend to be blind. One setting she would pretend she couldn't walk. One setting she had the voice of a little girl. One mental health expert indicated additional testing over an extended period of time ‘would provide a more reliable evaluation,’ attorney Winston Cochran said in a federal court filing. ‘Why rush to judgment on Basso?’ he asked, seeking a punishment delay that was refused Monday by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and a federal judge. He took his appeals Tuesday to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one step short of the Supreme Court. At the competency hearing, a haggard-looking Basso sporting a cropped haircut testified from a hospital bed wheeled into a Houston courtroom and talked about a snake smuggled into a prison hospital in an attempt to kill her. Shocking crime: Basso was convicted in 1999 of leading a group of thugs in cutting and bashing Musso before dumping his body in a ditch so they could cash his life insurance policy . Cochran said a degenerative disease has left her paralyzed. Basso, 59, contended her paralysis was the result of a jail beating years ago. At the hearing, she acknowledged representations about her background — that she was a triplet, worked in the New York governor's office, had a relationship with Nelson Rockefeller — were untrue. She originally was from the Albany and Schenectady areas of New York. Honey trap: Police say Basso met Musso during a church carnival in New Jersey and lured him to Texas after promising to marry him . At her trial, Basso was portrayed as the ringleader of a group of people who fatally tortured Musso in 1998 to steal his money. Musso, who had the intellect of a 7-year-old child but cared for himself, had met either Basso or her son at a church carnival in New Jersey. He left there to move in with her in Jacinto City, just east of Houston. ‘She lured him to Texas with the idea they'd get married,’ Barnett said. Evidence showed that she already was married, made herself the beneficiary of insurance policies purchased for Musso and took over his Social Security benefits. Five others, including Basso's son, also were convicted for Musso's death. Prosecutors sought the death penalty only for Basso. Court documents detailed extensive abuse Musso endured days before his body was found in a ditch by a jogger. He'd been bathed in a solution of bleach and pine cleaner and scrubbed with a wire brush. An autopsy showed he had at least 17 cuts to his head; 28 cuts and cigarette burns on his back; bruises all over his body; a skull fracture; a fractured bone in his neck; 14 broken ribs and two dislocated vertebrae. ‘It was just horrible, horrible, horrible,’ Barnett said. ‘When you talk about the death penalty, what the death penalty was made for, it was for a case like this.’ Web of lies: Basso had pretended to be blind or paralyzed, said she was a triplet, worked in the New York governor's office, and had a relationship with Nelson Rockefeller . Basso told police in a written statement that she drove Musso's body to the dump site. She became a suspect after reporting Musso missing in an apparent attempt to distance herself from his slaying once his body was discovered. None of the eight other women on Texas death row has an execution date.","Suzanne Basso, 59, was convicted in 1999 of being ringleader of a group of people who tortured and murdered Louis 'Buddy' Musso .

A mystery virus being referred to as 'the plague' continues to sweep through a Texas high school, having already infected over 700 students and staff members and causing them to become violently ill. The health department is trying to find the source of the stomach illness that first hit Richardson High School in North Texas last week, according to NBC, while cleaners have been brought in to scrub every possible surface on the premises to prevent the bug from spreading. 'It is scary, it really is,' father Demetrius Price, whose son was sent home sick, told NBC 5. 'For that many kids to get sick at one time is scary.' Scroll down for video . Preventing the plague: Some Richardson High School students have taken to wearing masks and carrying disinfectants in the wake of a mystery illness that has sickened hundreds . Cleaning spree: Extra cleaners have been brought in and have been working through the night to sanitize the school premises . Last Friday, over 700 students and staff members were absent from Richardson High School in North Texas after falling ill . School officials have ruled out the cafeteria as the source, believing it is not food related, however they don't know where the virus has come from. It all started Monday of last week, with 203 students and 12 staff members off sick. By Thursday, 349 students were absent, along with 22 staff members. Additionally, 70 more students were sent home at lunch. By Friday, an astonishing 675 students - about a quarter of the school's total student population of 2,500 - missed class, along with 28 staff members. Despite having the weekend as a buffer and the extreme cleaning measures taking place at the school, the situation was only slightly better on Monday. The Richardson Independent School District was able to confirm that 26 staff members and 239 students were sick Monday. Wash your hands: Health workers use a special glowing gel rubbed into the hands to show how easy germs can spread on surfaces . According to the district, there 191 students that called in and another 48 sent home early due to the illness. The main symptoms of the bug are vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue and weakness. Health experts have said the easiest way to stop the spread is general hygiene, specifically diligent hand washing. Mr Price said that when he came to pick up his freshmen son, the nurse's office was 'over run' with hundreds of sick kids. 'My son had a cold a few weeks ago, during that cold snap, but nothing serious,' Mr Price told NBC 5. 'This right here was so different. 'It put him on the couch. His energy was low. His appetite was gone. Worried parent: Demetrius Price, whose freshmen son was sent home with the sickness, described the virus as 'very scary' 'He kept feeling like he had to throw up. I don't know what it is. I was worried he was going to get real dehydrated.' Students started up a Twitter hashtag about the mysterious virus, called '#RHSPlague' and are trying to make light of the situation with jokes like 'More Plague = Better Parking'. The students that were in attendance Monday came armed with hand sanitizer. Others said they planned to go to the bathroom after each period to wash their hands.","Health department working to determine source of fast-spreading stomach virus at Richardson High School in North Texas .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:16 EST, 4 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:21 EST, 4 February 2014 . Bridget Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who was fired in disgrace over allegedly politically motivated traffic lane closures, says through her lawyer that she will not obey a subpoena for documents related to the embarrassing episode. Kelly has become the third New Jersey official to claim the protections of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects citizens from being forced to incriminate themselves in legal proceedings. Her lawyer wrote Monday to the legislative panel handling an investigation in the state capital of Trenton that Kelly is clinging to her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and to privacy rights enshrined in the Fourth Amendment. Former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly (R) is the third person to cite Fifth Amendment protections in refusing to provide investigators with information about the 'Bridgegate' scandal . She 'respectfully will not produce the . information demanded in the Committee's subpoena,' attorney Michael . Critchley wrote to Reid Schar, the special counsel in charge of the . probe. Schar made his . name prosecuting former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who is serving a . 14-year federal prison term for public corruption. 'The Fifth Amendment's protections are not limited to verbal testimony,' Critchley insisted in the letter published online by the Newark Star-Ledger. He also claimed some of the committee's subpoena demands were 'impermissibly overbroad' and might violate her right to privacy. The attorney did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment. Emails that surfaced in January . appeared to show Kelly orchestrating the closure of lanes leading from . Fort Lee, N.J. to the busy George Washington Bridge, a commuter route . into New York City. 'Time . for traffic problems in Fort Lee,' she wrote to Port Authority official . David Wildstein, who responded, 'Got it.' Wildstein was the first . official in the saga to cite the Fifth Amendment, refusing to testify in . a January 9 hearing. Wildstein's attorney wrote Friday that his client claimed 'evidence exists' showing Christie was inside the circle of people who knew about the lane closures when they were occurring. The governor's office fired back with emails, circulated among friends and political allies, claiming 'David Wildstein will do and say anything to save David Wildstein,' and slamming The New York Times for first misreporting what Wildstein's lawyer wrote. The attorney, the Times' original story incorrectly claimed, had said 'that the governor knew about the lane closings when they were happening, and that he had the evidence to prove it.' That text was quietly changed hours later without any acknowledgement. The New Jersey legislature's Select Committee on Investigation said Monday in a statement that it had begun to receive subpoenaed documents from some of the 18 people and two organizations that received the demands last month. David Wildstein, a former Port Authority appointee of the governor's, refused to testify during a January 9 hearing in Trenton, N.J. Bill Stepien, the political brain behind Christie's two successful gubernatorial elections, also refused on Friday to turn over documents, citing the Fifth Amendment. Kelly's decision hit the Internet while Gov. Christie was fielding questions during a regular 'Ask the Governor' radio segment. 'It doesn’t tell me anything,' he said about the decisions, three in all, to withhold information from investigators. Chris Christie fielded questions from New Jerseyans on Monday night during a regular radio segment as news broke that Kelly would refuse to cooperate with a subpoena . 'I would hope they would share any information they have that would let me get to the bottom of it,' Christie said, while continuing to insist he had no knowledge of the 'Bridgegate' lane closures before they were put into place. 'But on the other hand, they have constitutional rights like everybody else, and have the right to exercise them. There’s nothing I can do about that.' Loretta Weinberg, a Democratic state senator who co-chairs the committee investigating Christie's political orbit, told the Bergen County Record that 'It's frustrating when we’re trying to find the truth of the situation that started with the governor saying he was going to cooperate and urge others to do the same.' She and State Assemblyman John Wisniewski, the committee's other co-chair, said in a statement that they received Critchley's letter. 'We are reviewing it and considering our legal options with respect to enforcing the subpoena,' they said. Kelly’s announcement came just days after one of her former underlings, Christina Genovese Renna, resigned from Christie's office. Renna, the former director of New Jersey's Intergovernmental Affairs agency, left her job on Friday but said in a statement that she had been considering the move since shortly after Christie won re-election in November. Her lawyer said Monday that Renna, who received one of the committee's 20 subpoenas, would find it more and more difficult to leave as parallel investigations by the legislative committee and federal prosecutors gather steam.","Bridget Kelly, the governor's former deputy chief of staff, is refusing to turn over documents to a legislative committee .

The arrival of a baby usually means dad has to get rid of his beloved, impractical car. So news that Prince William has recently added a £250,000 Bentley to his garages is likely to make him the envy of many fathers-to-be up and down the country. The Flying Spur, which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will use for high-profile official engagements, is one of the world’s fastest saloon cars with a top speed of 200mph. Scroll down for video . The Flying Spur has a top speed of 200mph and features metal and composite armour to protect the Duke and Duchess . But it’s hardly economical, costing £118 to fill up and managing just 19 miles to the gallon. As . for special features, the hand-crafted walnut interior, the champagne . cooler and the wi-fi internet capabilities are more luxuries than purely . practical. William and Kate are also understood to have opted for quilted leather seats which heat up and have a massage function. Safety features include bullet-proof windows and super-hardened steel armour, contributing to its hefty three-ton weight. The couple were pictured in the Bentley last week as they arrived for a reception at the Natural History Museum in London. It is being leased privately from Bentley, a common arrangement for official cars used by members of the Royal Family. The couple, pictured in the car at the Natural History Museum last week, have added the £250k Bentley to their fleet of luxury vehicles . The Cambridges' new car has a walnut and champagne interior with heated, massage seats and a nine-litre bottle cooler . Bentley boasts two royal warrants, from . the Queen and the Prince of Wales, and in 2002 gifted the monarch with . her state limousine to mark the Golden Jubilee. Neither the car maker nor Kensington Palace were willing to discuss how much the Cambridges’ deal is worth or whether they have been given preferential rates. The cost is being met by the Duchy of Cornwall, which funds the official work of Prince Charles and his family. The couple were given one of the first Flying Spurs off the production line, six months before it was made available to the public. Before it was delivered, engineers at the firm’s headquarters in Crewe fitted the car with ballistic steel plating, triple-glazed 1.5in bullet-proof windows, tyres that stay inflated even after being punctured, and a loudspeaker system to ward off attackers. Vulnerable areas, such as the engine bay, radiator and fuel tank were also given extra cladding. According to sources, another leased car, a Jaguar, will be used for more low-key events. The couple also have a fleet of leased Range Rovers. All of the cars are shared with Prince Harry. Last September Prince William announced . that he was giving up his military duties to concentrate on his life as a . working royal, meaning the Bentley is likely to be dusted off more . frequently in the future.

The Wisconsin woman who lost all of her three young daughters when her ex-husband murdered them out of revenge has remarried, and is expecting a new child. Jennifer Peterson's ex-husband Aaron Schaffhausen had come over to her house for an unsupervised visit In July 2012 with the daughters Amara, 11, Sophie, 8, and Cecilia, 5. He called two hours later saying: 'you can come home now, I killed the kids'. Schaffhausen was sentenced to three consecutive  life sentences a year later. Getting better: Jessica Peterson (right), the mother of three girls murdered by their own father a year and a half ago, is now remarried and expecting a new baby. Pictured above with her husband Matthew . Too young: Mrs Peterson's daughters Amara (11), Sophie (8) and Cecilia (5) were murdered by their own father out of revenge . Behind bars: Mrs Peterson's ex-husband Aaron Schaffhausen was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences last July . Eighteen months after the brutal triple-murder Peterson is still pained by her daughters' loss, but is getting by with the support of her new husband Matthew and the business of getting ready for a new baby. Mrs Peterson is currently seven months pregnant. 'The key to much of my life is this balancing dual emotions, having to always be a little sad and a little happy at the same time,' Mrs Peterson told KTSP. 'It definitely helps in my process of trying to keep going, to bring some more love back into this world.' Mrs Peterson has a positive outlook considering all of the dark she's seen since July 10, 2012, when her ex texted her for permission to have an unscheduled visit with their daughters. She . consented but said he had to be gone before she got home because she . didn't want to see him. The girls' baby sitter told investigators the . children were excited when he arrived, and the sitter left. Tragic lives taken too soon: Cecilia, Amara and Sophie were all supposedly happy to see their father when he showed up for the unexpected visit . He called his ex-wife, Jessica Schaffhausen, about two hours later, saying: 'You can come home now, I killed the kids.' Police . arrived to find the girls lying in their beds, their throats slit and . their blankets pulled up to their necks. White T-shirts were tied around . their necks. Cecilia's body also showed signs of strangulation. During his trial last year, Schaffhausen tried to excuse his actions with an insanity plea. Trial . testimony showed that in the months leading up to the killings, . Schaffhausen told several people he had thoughts of killing his . daughters. His ex-wife . testified that in March 2012, he called her from Minot, North Dakota â€” where he was working â€” and told her he 'wanted to drive down there and . tie me up and make me pick which child he killed and make me watch while . he killed them.' Time gone by: Mrs Peterson pictured with her daughters in happier days . He also called his ex-wife repeatedly, sometimes up to 30 times a day, and threatened to kill the man she was dating. Schaffhausen . didn't testify at his trial. His defense attorney argued at trial that . Schaffhausen has a rare mental disorder rooted in deep dependency on his . ex-wife, and believed the only way he could 'solve' his problem was to . commit suicide or homicide. The jury rejected his insanity defense. Not insane: The jury rejected Schaffhausen's insanity plea . 'This is a vicious, aggravated crime,' St Croix County Circuit Judge Howard Cameron said before handing down the sentence last July. The judge chose consecutive life sentences to send a message that 'each child is so important.' Now that her ex-husband is safely behind bars, Mrs Peterson is finding ways to keep her daughter's memories alive while also moving on. She is currently working to build Tri-Angels Playground, a public space to honor her daughters. Remembered: Mrs Peterson is now working on building a park to memorialize her daughters . 'Something people count interact with and make their own memories, and in that way, keep my girls' memories alive,' she said. The project costs $550,00 to build and she's only raised $247,000 so she's asking for more donations. Bremer Bank has agreed to match donation up to $50,000 and she hopes to open the park in the spring or summer of next year. 'I miss the girls still a lot,' Peterson said. 'That's a pain I think I'll always carry. But I try to do it in a way that would make them proud of me, in much the way I would want them to carry on if they'd lost me.'

A mother and her boyfriend have been charged with murder after her daughter was beaten to death just days after first birthday. Brandy Ann Boyd, 25, and Austin Levi Payne, 24, both of Cartersville, Georgia, were arrested three days after Journey Ann Cowart was rushed to the hospital, not breathing, on January 21.

'A fractured skull, blunt force . trauma to the stomach,' Sheriff Clark Millsap told the Atlanta Journal Constitution of the autopsy results. Charged: Brandy Ann Boyd, left, and Austin Levi Payne, right, have been charged with murder after an autospy revealed that Boyd's one-year-old daughter had suffered numerous beatings before she died last month .

Authorities are not linking the investigations into the deaths of Cowart and baby Journey. Journey's funeral was held on Monday afternoon at The Church at Liberty Square in Cartersville. Following the service, Journey's paternal grandparents, Mellodie and Allen Hunt, told CBS Atlanta that they were still stunned at the child's death. 'I . can't wrap my mind around that someone did that to a baby,' Mrs Hunt . said. 'It's supposed to be your natural instinct as mother to protect . her.'

After their son was . found dead, they said they always had to fight to see their grandchild . every month. Sometimes, they saw bruises, they said. Boyd 'explained it away, said she fell and hit her head on the bed', Mr Hunt said. The Hunts are now trying to get custody of Journey Ann's remains so they can bury her next to their son. Boyd, from Cartersville, lists on her Facebook profile her job as 'Mommy' at 'I Love Being a Mom'. The 25-year-old attended Cass High School and Kennesaw State University. Boyd has been in a relationship with Payne since 2013. He lists his occupation as 'boxing'.","Brandy Ann Boyd, 25, and her boyfriend Austin Levi Payne, 24, were charged with cruelty to children but this has been upgraded to murder .

What was once believed to be a camp for the Pyramid builders in Giza may have actually been barracks for the Pharoah’s military troops. Archaeologists have discovered evidence of barracks close to an ancient port suggesting the settlement could have been home to soldiers or sailors. The findings call into question previous theories that thousands of workers would have set up camp in the region while building the pyramid of Giza. Archaeologists have discovered evidence of what is believed to be ancient barracks, pictured, close to the site of a port near Giza in Egypt. The location of the barracks to this port suggests the settlement could have been home to soldiers or sailors . Menkaure was the son of Khafra and the . grandson of Khufu. He was born in 2530BC and reigned for approximately 22 years - although some reports put this figure higher. He was part of the 4th dynasty and during his reign, Menkaure commissioned the final pyramid in Giza to be . built. It is known as the Pyramid of Menkaure or Netjer-er-Menkaur, which . means 'Menkaure is divine.' A monument close to the site of the pyramid was built in honour of Queen Khentkawes, believed to be Menkaure's daughter. Menkaure was buried in this pyramid and a sarcophagus was excavated from the burial chamber in 1837 before being shipped to the British Museum in London. Researchers from Ancient Egypt Research Associates (AERA) based in Massachusetts have been excavating the site, situated approximately 1,300ft south of the Great Sphinx of Giza, since 1988. Last year, they discovered a large collection of animal bones, evidence of an ancient slaughter house for animals and a cemetery, thought to have been full of the bodies of pyramid workers. The site is popularly known as the Lost City of Pyramid Builders, or Heit el-Ghurab and is believed to date back to the reign of pharaoh Menkaure at around 2550BC. Menkaure was the son of Khafra and the grandson of Khufu and commissioned the final pyramid in Giza to be built, known as the Pyramid of Menkaure or Netjer-er-Menkaur, which means ‘Menkaure is divine.’ This reconstruction of the ancient barracks shows how troops lived and worked in the three-storey settlement. The total size of the site is said to cover almost ten football pitches. AERA believes the it would have been built in the 35 to 50 years that spanned the reigns of pharoahs Khafre and Menkaure . Excavtors also found a large basin,  pictured, near the site of the barrackes, suggesting the area may have been a port. This was bolstered by the fact the basin was found approximately half a mile away from a channel of the River Nile . However, more recent findings near . this site, close to a monument dedicated to what is said to be . Menkaure’s daughter Queen Khentkawes, suggest the area may have been a . port. Excavators . discovered a large basin that may have formed part of a harbour or . waterfront.

AERA . director Mark Lehenr and his team also found charcoal remains of trees . that came from the Levant, a region in the eastern Mediterranean, along . with pottery and jars for the same location.

Researchers also found charcoal remains of trees, and pottery from the Levant region in the eastern Mediterranean . Elsewhere, on the site of the Lost City, the archaeologists found evidence of long buildings called galleries, pictured, that could have been used to house visitors to the port. The galleries would have been approximately 113ft long and 23ft tall . The site of the AERA dig is popularly known as the Lost City of the Pyramid Builders (pictured) because of its close proximity to the Giza pyramids. Last year, researchers discovered a large . collection of animal bones, evidence of an ancient slaughter house, and a cemetery, thought to have been full of the bodies of . pyramid workers. However, the latest findings suggest the site was used by sailors and troops, which has raised questions surrounding where the workers lived, and died. In 2004, remains of builders were found in ancient dumps near the structures, but not evidence of buildings or a settlement were found. AERA's director Michael Lerner told LiveScience he believes the builders slept on the ramps they are believed to have used to construct the vast landmarks. For centuries it's been thought that the ancient Egyptians built their huge pyramids by hauling heavy granite blocks up these specially crafted ramps. Yet Newport engineer Peter James has branded this ‘impossible’, claiming the ramps would need to have been a quarter of a mile long or else they would have been too steep to carry the large blocks up. He believes, instead, that the Egyptians built an inner core of zigzagging ramps, using smaller, lighter blocks while the larger outer casing stones were placed on the outside using scaffolding. If this is true, this would cast doubt on Lehner's claims about where the workers slept - once again raising the question about where they stayed. Materials used to build the pyramids in the region could have been transported along the Nile to this port, and may have been distributed via the settlement harbour. Elsewhere, on the site of the Lost City, the archaeologists found evidence of long building called galleries that could have been used to house visitors to the port. It is thought that sailors may have travelled to and from the Levant, or troops used to guard the pharaoh and his family and friends. Researchers from Ancient Egypt Research Associates (AERA) based in Massachusetts have been excavating the site, marked at A, situated approximately 1,300ft south of the Great Sphinx of Giza, since 1988 . The galleries would have been approximately 113ft long and 23ft tall. In 2012, researchers found the hip of a hippo. A ritual in ancient Egypt among troops involved hunting and harpooning hippos, and the discovery of the hip adds weight to these claims troops occupied the area at some time. The total size of the site is said to cover almost ten football pitches. AERA believes the development of the urban complex would have been 'quite rapid', and happened in the 35 to 50 years that spanned the reigns of Khafre and Menkaure.","Researchers have been excavating remains near the city of Giza since 1988 .

Ford made the comment after one of the hosts call Bieber 'Canada's worst export.' Asked if he was a fan of Bieber's music, Ford said his tastes leaned more toward classic rock acts such as Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, and the Eagles. 'I'm 45 years old, so there's a big difference here,' he said, adding that he hadn't met the teen either. Give him a break: 'Well, you know what, he's a young guy,' said Ford, in the 19-year-old pop star's defense . On Wednesday, a White House petition demanding the administration deport Bieber, who is in the U.S. on a temporary work visa, reached 100,000 signatures, the threshold to require a response from the White House. By Thursday, more than double that number had signed the petition and a similar one on the White House website.

Ford, who is running for re-election as the mayor of Canada's largest city, also faced fresh controversy Wednesday after his sister's former boyfriend filed a lawsuit alleging Ford had conspired to have him threatened and beaten while in prison. Asked about the lawsuit on the radio show, Ford declined to comment, saying the matter was before the courts. Ford's lawyer said the allegations were false and irresponsible.

But the official toxicology report confirms that he had marijuana and the active ingredient of Xanax in his system. The news comes as his father, apparently unconcerned by his son's recent behavior, tweeted a whimsical picture of Bieber tucked up in bed with his toddler brother this morning. One of the White House petitions to deport Bieber reads: 'Nineteen years ago America was a place of serenity before our ears were tainted by Justin Bieber's abominable music and the images of him peeing in mop buckets and atop the snowcapped Colorado mountains. 'He has shown that he is incapable of contributing anything to our society other than stimulating the marijuana industry, single-handedly keeping the saggy hammer-pants trend alive, and giving Selena Gomez inspiration to write break-up songs.

Parents are outraged after an elementary school took away meals from 40 children and threw them away because their families were behind on payments. The affected children at Uintah Elementary School in Salt Lake City had already filled up their trays on Tuesday and were at the payment counter when staff notified them that their parents were in debt. The trays were taken from them and the food was thrown away. The children instead received a piece of fruit and milk for lunch, staff said. 'My daughter called me from the . school and was crying that they weren't going to give her lunch because . she didn't have any money,' Kevin Conway, whose daughter is in the third grade, told MailOnline. Upset: Kevin Conway said his daughter (both pictured) called him crying to say that the school had refused to give her lunch because their account was in debt. He had never been told about the negative balance . He said that she had been refused lunch because the account was just $4 in debt - and the system had failed to notify him. 'The first notification was from my daughter, when she called me crying,' he said. 'I'd understand if it was $50, but this was just a few dollars. One parent was negative $2.' Jason Olsen, a Salt Lake City District . spokesman, said that the child-nutrition department had realized some . students' families had outstanding balances on Monday.

Anger: Erica Lukes' 11-year-old daughter had her lunch taken away and thrown in the trash at school because she was unknowingly behind on payments. Up to 40 children were affected at a Utah school . 'Something's not working, and that's what . the school and child-nutrition department are going to work on . together,' Olsen told the Salt Lake Tribune. 'This can be easily prevented.' Mr Olsen said he did not receive a call or email from the school ahead of the incident. Another parent, Erica Lukes, said she did not receive any notification either, and said the experience was 'traumatic and humiliating' for her 11-year-old child and others. 'I . think it's despicable,' she said. 'These are young children that shouldn't be . punished or humiliated for something the parents obviously need to clear . up.'

Physicist Professor Stephen Hawking, pictured, admitted he was disappointed when the Higgs boson 'God particle' was found . The discovery of the Higgs boson ‘God particle’ was widely considered the biggest scientific breakthrough of modern day - so much so it won this year’s Nobel Prize for Physics - but not everyone was quite so impressed. Leading physicist Professor Stephen Hawking has admitted he was disappointed by the discovery and believes ‘physics would be far more interesting if it had not been found.’ The 71-year-old made the claims during a sold-out event at London’s Science Museum to celebrate the launch of its new Collider exhibition. The exhibition gives visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the LHC and CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva. The Higgs boson's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. It has been described as the ‘missing piece’ of the Standard Model, which explains how the parts of the universe that we understand interact with one another. Without this mass, particles would zip around the cosmos, unable to bind together to form the atoms that make stars and planets - and people. The particle was confirmed using the Large Hadron Collider - the highest-energy particle collider ever made, built by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 2012.

Professor Hawking also had a more personal reason to lament the discovery, which earned Edinburgh scientist Professor Peter Higgs a £776,000 share of the Nobel Prize in Physics. ‘I had a bet with Gordon Kane of Michigan University that the Higgs particle wouldn't be found,’ he said. ‘The Nobel Prize cost me $100.’ During this talk, the Professor also discussed being the longest known survivor of ALS, or motor neurone disease, and his slacker days as a student of natural science at Oxford University. He admitted he once calculated he did about 1,000 hours of work during his three years at Oxford - an average of an hour a day. ‘Because of my lack of work, I had planned to get through the final exam by doing problems in theoretical physics and avoiding questions that required factual knowledge. 'But I didn't sleep the night before the exam, because of nervous tension, and so I didn't do very well. I was on the borderline between a first and second class degree.’ Nonetheless Hawking was awarded a first and went on to pursue a career in mathematics and cosmology at Cambridge University, where he is now Director of Research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. Professor Hawking also explained why he believes in one of the most exotic ideas in physics today, M-theory, which proposes the existence of a myriad different universes all created out of nothing. ‘These multiple universes can arise naturally from physical law,’ said Professor Hawking.

Professor Hawking said: 'I had a bet with Gordon Kane of Michigan University that the Higgs particle wouldn't be found.

Only a very few would allow creatures like us to exist. ‘Thus, our presence selects out from the vast array only those universes that are compatible with our existence. Although we are puny and insignificant on the scale of the Cosmos, this makes us, in a sense, lords of creation.’ Professor Hawking believes it is possible the first evidence for M-theory will be seen at the LHC. The theoretical physicist also said that the future of the human race depends on going into space. ‘I don't think we will survive another thousand years without escaping beyond our fragile planet,’ Professor Hawking continued. Ending . his talk, he told his audience: ‘So remember to look up at the stars . and not down at your feet.

The Trekker is operated by a smart phone and consists of 15 lenses angled in a different direction so the images can be stitched together into 360-degree panoramic views. It is controlled by a smartphone, and images electronically stitched together. 'It’s very exciting because there’s so much more potential for it being useful to scientists,' said Cole Kelleher, a cartographer and support coordinator at PGC, which is headquartered at the University of Minnesota, told the Antarctic Sun.

The Trekker is operated by a smart phone and consists of 15 lenses angled in a different direction so the images can be stitched together into 360-degree panoramic views. It has previously been used to capture the Grand Canyon, the River Thames and hundreds of other areas around the world where Google's cars and trikes can't reach. The Internet giant recently unveiled its latest batch of panoramic imagery for its Google Maps and Google Earth applications that include some remote and stunning areas of Antarctica. PGC cartographer Cole Kelleher walks through the Adélie penguin colony at Cape Royds with the Google Street View camera strapped onto his back. The mobile Trekker camera was introduced last year and first used in Arizona’s Grand Canyon. Photos are taken roughly every 2½ seconds while the walker is in motion. 'It’s very top heavy. … That was probably the toughest part – taking care of it and trying not to damage it,' Kelleher told the Sun. 'I told [Google] it would probably not come back in the condition it goes out in. 'You’re out in the middle of nowhere. 'It’s tough terrain - although I only fell about three times.'

The Cape Royal Adelie Penguin Colony: The Adélie Penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae, is a species of penguin common along the entire Antarctic coast. They are among the most southerly distributed of all seabirds. In 1840, French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville named them for his wife, Adèle.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Defra, the food and farming ministry, have refused to identify the East Anglia farm involved. They have also decided to allow the turkeys to be sold as normal. Officials claim any risk to  consumers is ‘very low’. But food industry experts have said it is vital consumers are given the full facts about safety issues. Nick Martin, of Trace One, a technology company that works with supermarkets, said: ‘As the horsemeat crisis has shown, transparency is key when it comes to addressing consumer concerns over food products to avoid a public backlash. ‘Defra and the FSA have a duty to report the full details of the MRSA infection to consumers.’ The strain of MRSA was found on a small farm that sells thousands of turkeys to independent butchers and markets, rather than to a major supermarket. The Government’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, said: ‘This MRSA is not a human sort and you can kill it by cooking the turkey well. This type of animal MRSA is rare in this country. ‘It’s killed by cooking and even if it isn’t, it’s low risk and not very frequent,’ she added. While human superbug MRSA causes stomach upsets, anyone with this strain would develop a skin rash, similar to eczema.

The buyer, Veria Lifestyle, plans to transform the 1,300-acre New York state property into a $90 million destination offering yoga, golf, tennis and other healthy activities. End of an era: Kusher's is going to be demolished to make way for a new health retreat . Lakeside: The property has both natural and man-made lakes and offered water-sports, golf and tennis . During its heyday, the resort located 75 miles northwest of New York City was one of the most famous of the 'Borscht Belt' hotels in the Catskills when the region attracted largely Jewish families who headed upstate to escape the summer heat. Owned for decades by the Kutsher family, the century-old resort hosted entertainers such as Tony Bennett, Milton Berle and Jerry Seinfeld. Muhammad Ali even trained at Kutsherâ€™s, as did other world boxing champions, such as Floyd Patterson and Leon Spinks. Complete with manmade and natural lakes, condos, bungalows, an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, an ice-skating rink and summer camps, the resort's buildings are set to be demolished and replaced with buildings that will house 'yoga sciences,' 'ayurvedic medical treatment,' and 'biodynamic restaurants.' Summer resort: Jennifer Gray's Baby practices her moves at the fictional Catskills resort Kellerman's . In the corner: All-inclusive resort holidays featuring huge dining rooms and lively entertainment like that featured in Dirty Dancing were hugely popular between the 1950s and 1980s . Max and Louis Kutsher opened the Kutsher's Brothers Farm House in 1907 and expanded the property in the 1920s and 1930s. Milton Kutsher oversaw the hotel's growth between the 1950s and the 1980s, the Catskills pinnacle, when the region was a summertime destination for Jewish families from New York City. Milton Kutsher and his wife Helen ran the hotel until his death in 1998, when son Mark Kutsher took over. Dated: The once-fashionable interiors have become increasingly faded over the years . Seen better days: The once thriving resort was first opened in 1907 and saw its pinnacle between the 1950s and 1980s . According to the Record Online, most recently the hotel has been branded as The New Kutsher's Resort and leased to Yossi Zablocki. Over the past few years it has hosted festivals including the New York Harvest Festival and All Tomorrow's Parties. Tragically, a young woman working for the 17th Annual Harvest and Freedom Festival fell to her death from a condemned building at Kutsher's in October. Last month, voters in New York State authorized casinos as a tool to reinvigorate the decaying Catskill resorts, but as yet the area remains neglected.","Kutsher's resort in the Catskills was sold on Wednesday .

A thief who stole more than £500 by attaching a device to catch people's money at cash machines has been jailed for two years. Romanian Marcel Dumitru, 35, stole money from eight different ATM users by fixing the device on machines at a Post Office and a Morrisons supermarket in Greater Manchester. The scam saw customers attempting to withdraw cash greeted with an error message on the ATM's screen. Sentenced: Marcel Dumitru, left, was jailed for two years at Bolton Crown Court today after stealing more than £500 by using a device to steal ATM customer's cash. His alleged accomplice Petre Ionita, right, was due to appear at the same hearing but jumped bail . Instead, their money would be trapped by Dumitru's device and the thief would wait until customers had walked away empty handed before collecting the cash himself. Police are still searching for Dumitru's alleged accomplice Petre Ionita, 27, who was also due to appear at the same hearing but jumped bail back in March. Bolton Crown Court heard that Dumitru, who is currently serving ten months in prison for attempted theft and possessing articles for use in fraud, had previously been jailed for fitting card skimming devices to cash machines. But Dumitru resumed his criminal activities upon his release from custody in late 2012. He used a device with a metal or plastic pad with a sticky plate attached to prevent people's money from being dispensed from two cash machines in Bury between December 2012 and February 2013. Dumitru and Ionita were eventually arrested when officers on patrol in Bolton stopped their blue Ford Escort. Officers searched the car and found that the sat nav had various cash points and Post Offices in its destination history along with 30 blank credit cards, six rolls of double sided tape and two silver plastic carpet grips. Hearing: Bolton Crown Court, pictured, heard that Dumitru had been jailed in the past for similar scams . Ionita was granted bail but disappeared on March 14. The court heard that Dumitru, of Longsight, Manchester, was one of three men arrested in 2011 after fitting card-skimming devices to a cash machine in Aberdeen. The men were seen attaching the device to the top of a cash machine at a Co-op store. The following day a customer who tried to use it received an 'error' message which said his card would be retained. But he could still see his card and managed to pull it free from the machine bringing a card-skimming device with it. Dumitru was caught when he returned to the cash machine and was seen by a member of staff who called police after recognising him from footage showing the group fitting the device. He was jailed for five months for the offence. Both Dumitru and Ionita were jailed for 16 months in February 2012 after a similar scam. Dumitru is also currently serving a 10 month sentence at Dovegate jail in Staffordshire imposed in June after he was convicted of similar offences relating to attempted theft and possessing articles for use in fraud in Kidsgrove, near Newcastle-under-Lyme. Sergeant Harrison White, of Greater Manchester Police said follwing Dumitru's sentencing: 'He used an improvised cash-trap device to con bank customers into thinking the ATMs were faulty. 'Dumitru cynically preyed on people’s confusion to go back after they’d left, retrieve their device and pocket whatever cash had been dispensed. 'The device may have been improvised and relatively crude, but this was a well-planned attempt to steal from innocent members of the public.'","Marcel Dumitru was jailed for two years at Bolton Crown Court today .

His father Ron Thomas was nowhere near the scene that night as the police officers allegedly kneed, shocked and pinned his son down in a nearly 10-minute brawl, but he has stood by him ever since, championing a call for justice that heads to court  today for two of the six officers involved. Manuel Ramos, is charged with second-degree murder, marking the first murder trial of a uniformed police officer in conservative Orange County's history. 'It's like a wound you keep opening,' said Ron Thomas, who says his son was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

It'll get you to the point where you can't function and you just cry a lot.' Ramos, 39, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. Jay Cicinelli, 42, has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and use of excessive force. Both are free on bail. A third officer will be tried separately on charges of involuntary manslaughter and excessive force. Three other officers were not charged. The case garnered national attention at the time and fuelled months of local protests that led to the resignation of the police chief and a recall election in the small college town.

Two officers will face trial over his death . Better times: Kelly Thomas in 1997 when he was about 23 years old. He was beaten to death two years ago . The coroner listed Kelly's cause of death as mechanical compression of the thorax, which made it impossible for him to breath normally . District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has said investigators overlaid recordings from the officers' body microphones with the tape, allowing prosecutors to provide a blow-by-blow narrative of an 'impending beating by an angry police officer' and verbatim quotes from the officers and Thomas as the scene unfolded. Initially, Ramos chides Thomas for his evasive answers: 'It seems like every day, we have to talk to you about somethin' ... Do you enjoy it?' Ramos asks Thomas, according to a prosecution transcript. Within minutes, Ramos grows angry as Thomas refuses to cooperate. He snaps on latex gloves, holds his fists in front of Thomas' face and says, 'Now see my fists? They are getting ready to (expletive) you up.' Thomas stood up and pulled away, prosecutors said, and Ramos chased him down, tackled him and punched him in the ribs as he pinned him down. Cicinelli, who arrived moments later, . is accused of kneeing Thomas twice in the head and using a Taser on him . four times before hitting him in the face with the blunt end of the . stun gun eight times.

'This is a case where the district attorney's office is fighting for what law enforcement is supposed to be in Orange County and for our community. It's not OK for police officers to commit crimes,' said Susan Kang Schroeder, the district attorney's chief of staff. Defence attorneys, however, portray a very different encounter and are seeking to introduce evidence that Thomas had a history of violence and suffered from psychotic episodes due to prolonged methamphetamine abuse. The surveillance video doesn't begin until 25 seconds into the confrontation and doesn't show, for example, how Thomas reached repeatedly for Cicinelli's weapon as they struggled, according to defence motions. In the audio recordings, Cicinelli can be heard telling others that Thomas must be 'on something' because it took three officers to get him in handcuffs. Ramos adds that Thomas tried to bite him through his pants. The judge will allow defence attorneys to tell the jury about Thomas' prior conviction for assaulting his grandfather with a fireplace poker and about a restraining order that his mother sought against him after he held her by the throat during an argument. The defence team also plans to present its own expert who will testify that Thomas had an enlarged heart due to chronic methamphetamine abuse, providing an alternate cause of death. The prosecution has painted a 'false image of Kelly Thomas being this sort of compliant, non-violent homeless person and that is belied by the other incidents,' Ramos' attorney, John Barnett, said at a recent pre-trial hearing. He added outside court that there was no evidence of schizophrenia, but that Thomas 'took meth and LSD since the 10th grade and ruined his cognitive abilities.' Thomas' father is angered by talk of drug abuse and points out his son didn't have anything in his system that night. 'It doesn't matter what my son did in his life, it just doesn't matter. It's what the officers did that night,' he said. 'That's what this trial's about.'","Kelly Thomas was beaten to death in Fullerton, California, two years ago .

Ruled out: French experts have ruled out a theory that Yasser Arafat was killed by poisoning, according to a source close to the investigation into his death . French experts have ruled out a theory that Yasser Arafat was killed by poisoning, according to a source close to the investigation into the Palestinian leader's 2004 death. 'The report rules out the poisoning theory and goes in the sense of a natural death,' the source told AFP. The French experts' findings differ significantly from those of Swiss scientists, who said last month that their research offered some support for the suggestion Arafat was killed by polonium poisoning. Rumours and speculation have surrounded Arafat's death since a quick deterioration of his health saw his passing at a military hospital near Paris in November 2004 at the age of 75. French doctors were unable to say what killed him and an autopsy was never performed, at the request of his widow. Many Palestinians believed he was poisoned by Israel -- a claim repeatedly denied by the Jewish state. Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the results of the French probe were 'no surprise'. France opened a formal murder inquiry into his death in August 2012, a month after an Al-Jazeera documentary linked his death to polonium poisoning. Some 60 samples were taken from . Arafat's remains in November 2012 and divided between Swiss and Russian . investigators and a French team carrying out a probe at his widow's . request. Results: Last month his widow Suha Arafat,  claimed he had been assassinated after tests carried out by Swiss experts found the Palestinian leader had unexpectedly high levels of the radioactive substance in his body . Both the . prosecutors' office in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, which is conducting . the French probe, and a lawyer for Arafat's widow Suha refused to . comment on the investigation's findings Tuesday. The . Swiss team said the test results neither confirmed nor denied polonium . was the actual source of his death, although they provided 'moderate' backing for the idea he was poisoned by the rare and highly radioactive . element. They said the quantity of the deadly substance found on his remains pointed to the involvement of a third party. The remains of Yasser Arafat were exhumed from his grave in November 2012 so international forensic experts could search for additional clues to his death . Work underway: In November 2012, workers began prying open the concrete-encased tomb in Arafat's former government headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah . Russia's Federal Medical-Biological Agency (FMBA) has yet to release its findings. A . report by news agency Interfax in October quoted its chief Vladimir . Uiba as saying Arafat 'could not have been poisoned by polonium' but the . medical agency later denied he had made any statement. Palestinian . Justice Minister Ali Mhanna last month urged France to release the . results of its probe, saying the Palestinians were sure Arafat had been . poisoned and that Israel was the 'only suspect' in his death. Today a Palestinian investigator said he would soon name the people he believed were responsible for the death almost a decade after he started searching for suspects. Many Palestinians have long believed Israel killed him - a charge Israel flatly denies - but an official Palestinian Authority investigation headed by Tawfiq Tirawi has yet to produce any evidence. 'I promise that the next press conference will be the last, and will cast into the light of day everyone who perpetrated, took part in or conspired in the matter,' Tirawi told Palestine Today television. 'We are in the last 15 minutes of the investigation,' he added. Israeli . President Shimon Peres, who shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize with . Arafat and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, said last month that . the reports of polonium poisoning were unbelievable. 'If someone had wanted to get rid of Arafat, it would have been easier to do it with a bullet,' he said. Cause of death: Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat saying goodbye as he boarded a Jordanian army helicopter to fly to Paris to seek medical treatment. Arafat died a month later in a French military hospital . The Swiss team's findings sparked fresh accusations from the Palestinians and increased tensions with Israel at a delicate time. US-brokered . peace talks resumed at the end of July after a three-year gap, but have . already hit a deadlock over Israeli settlement expansion in the . occupied West Bank on land the Palestinians want for their future state. Arafat . shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Israeli leaders after signing the . landmark Oslo accords in 1993, when hopes ran high for a negotiated . settlement to the conflict. Respect: Hundreds of Palestinian school children walk past the grave of Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat November 21, 2004 in Ramallah, West Bank . But . the negotiations broke down seven years later amid bitter . recriminations on both sides, and a bloody Palestinian intifada, or . uprising, erupted that would eventually claim the lives of some 3,000 . Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis from 2000-2005. Israel . and the United States blamed Arafat for a wave of suicide bombings and . other attacks on Israelis during the uprising, while Arafat insisted he . was powerless to prevent Palestinians from retaliating for deadly . Israeli military operations in the occupied territories. Hani al-Hassan, a former aide, said . in 2003 that he had witnessed 13 assassination attempts on Arafat's . life, dating back to his years on the run as PLO leader. Arafat claimed to have survived 40 attempts on his life. Presence: A Palestinian women stands beneath a banner depicting the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah today . Arafat narrowly escaped an Israeli air strike on his headquarters in Tunisia in 1985. He had just gone out jogging when the bombers attacked, killing 73 people. He escaped another attempt on his life when Israeli warplanes came close to killing him during the 182 invasion of Beirut when they hit one of the buildings they suspected he was using as his headquarters but he was not there. In December 2001, Arafat was rushed to safety just before Israeli helicopters bombarded his compound in Ramallah with rockets.","Yasser Arafat's corpse was tested by a Swiss forensic team this year .

Bird beaks were thought to have evolved since the dinosaurs to replace teeth, but new fossil findings suggest beaks are much older. Beaks are a typical hallmark of modern birds and can be found in a huge variety of forms and shapes to cope with the environment and food sources. For example a hummingbird has along thin beak to get at flower nectar while others such as parrots evolved to be able to crack nuts and fruit seeds. A study led by the University of Bristol has found that dinosaur beaks evolved for eating prior to their role in aiding flight. Pictured is the original fossil of Erlikosaurus andrewsi (back) and life reconstruction (front) depicting the animal with a keratinous beak . However the new study by the University of Bristol has shed light on the functional importance of dinosaur beaks. Less well known was that keratin-covered beaks had already evolved in different groups of dinosaurs during the Cretaceous Period. Employing high-resolution CT scanning and computer simulations scientists used digital models to take a closer look at these dinosaur beaks. Computer models of the skull of Erlikosaurus andrewsi show it without (left) and with a keratinous beak (right).  Colour plots on this image reveal the degree of deformation in the different skull configurations . Erlikosaurus andrewsi was a large . herbivorous dinosaur called a therizinosaur, which lived more than 90 . million years ago during the Cretaceous Period in what is now Mongolia. In 1980, Altangerel Perle named Erlikosaurus andrewsi after the demon Erlik from Mongolian mythology. These dinosaurs, which may have been feathered, were fairly large and had long, sharp hand claws. The snout of the 10- to 13-foot-long (3- to 4-metre-long) therizinosaur is thought to have been partly covered with a keratinous beak. These beaks may have developed to improve stability of the skull while the dinosaur was feeding. The focus of the study was the skull of Erlikosaurus andrewsi, a 10-13ft large herbivorous dinosaur called a therizinosaur, which lived more than 90 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period in what is now Mongolia. The dinosaur showed evidence that part of its snout was covered by a keratinous beak. The study reveals that keratinous beaks played an important role in stabilising the skeletal structure during feeding, making the skull less susceptible to bending and deformation. Dr Stephan Lautenschlager of Bristolâ€™s School of Earth Sciences said: 'It has classically been assumed that beaks evolved to replace teeth and thus save weight, as a requirement for the evolution of flight. 'Our results, however, indicate that keratin beaks were in fact beneficial to enhance the stability of the skull during biting and feeding.' Erlikosaurus andrewsi was a large herbivorous dinosaur called a therizinosaur, which lived more than 90 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period in what is now Mongolia . Dr Emily Rayfield a reader of Palaeobiology added: 'Using Finite Element Analysis, a computer modelling technique routinely used in engineering, we were able to deduce very accurately how bite and muscle forces affected the skull of Erlikosaurus during the feeding process. 'This further allowed us to identify the importance of soft-tissue structures, such as the keratinous beak, which are normally not preserved in fossils.' 'Beaks evolved several times during the transitions from dinosaurs to modern birds, usually accompanied by the partial or complete loss of teeth and our study now shows that keratin-covered beaks represent a functional innovation during dinosaur evolution,' said Professor Lawrence Witmer of Ohio University.","Snout of the Erlikosaurus andrewsi was found to be covered with keratin .
Keratin is a tough material found in the beaks and claws of birds .

Amazon’s plan to let self-guided drones deliver packages has run in to regulatory turbulence. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of the online giant, is working on a way to use small aircraft to get parcels to customers in 30 minutes or less. While flight technology makes it feasible, U.S. law and society's attitude toward drones haven't caught up with Bezos' vision. The company says it's working on the so-called Prime Air unmanned aircraft project but it will take years to advance the technology and for the Federal Aviation Administration to create the necessary rules and regulations. Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos says that he wants to use octocoptors (pictured) to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes - and now has plans to begin sending orders before customers even click buy . The project was first reported by CBS' '60 Minutes' Sunday night, where Bezos said that while his octocopters look like something out of science fiction, there's no reason they can't be used as delivery vehicles. Bezos said the drones can carry packages that weigh up to five pounds, which covers about 86 per cent of the items Amazon delivers. The drones the company is testing have a range of about 10 miles, which Bezos noted could cover a significant portion of the population in urban areas. Bezos told '60 Minutes' the project could become a working service in four or five years. Unlike the drones used by the military, Bezos' proposed flying machines won't need humans to control them remotely. Amazon's drones would receive a set of GPS coordinates and automatically fly to them, presumably avoiding buildings, power lines and other obstacles. Delivery drones raise a host of concerns, from air traffic safety to homeland security and privacy. There . are technological and legal obstacles, too —similar to Google's . experimental driverless car. How do you design a machine that safely . navigates the roads or skies without hitting anything? And, if an . accident occurs, who's legally liable? Delivering packages by drone might be impossible in a city like Washington D.C. which has many no-fly zones. To the door: The drones will be programmed with the specific GPS coordinates of an address . Most items: 86 per cent of the shipments made by Amazon way less than five pounds, which is the amount of weight that the drones would be able to carry . 'It's fascinating as an idea and probably very hard to execute,' says Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies who sees Bezos as an unconventional thinker. 'If he could really deliver something you order within 30 minutes, he would rewrite the rules of online retail.' Amazon spends heavily on growing its business, improving order fulfillment and expanding into new areas. Those investments have come at the expense of consistent profitability, but investors have been largely forgiving, focusing on the company's long-term promise and double-digit revenue growth. Headed to Washington: U.S. law forbid the commercial use of unmanned drones so negotiations with the FAA will be important to allow the Amazon initiative to be permitted . The company spent almost $2.9billion in shipping last year, accounting for 4.7 per cent of its net sales. There is no prohibition on flying drones for recreational use, but since 2007, the Federal Aviation Administration has said they can't be used for commercial purposes. 'The technology has moved forward faster than the law has kept pace,' says Brendan Schulman, special counsel at the law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP. Schulman is currently challenging that regulation before a federal administrative law judge on behalf of a client who was using a radio-controlled aircraft to shoot video for an advertising agency. Autonomous flights like Amazon is proposing, without somebody at the controls, are also prohibited. The . FAA is slowly moving forward with guidelines on commercial drone use. Last year, Congress directed the agency to grant drones access to U.S. skies by September 2015, but the agency already has missed several key . deadlines and said the process would take longer than Congress expected. The . FAA plans to propose rules next year that could allow limited use of . drones weighing up to 55 pounds, but those rules are also expected to . include major restrictions on where drones can fly, posing significant . limits on what Amazon could do. Many of the commercial advances in drone use have come out of Europe, Australia, and Japan. In Australia, for instance, an electric company is using drones to check on remote power lines. 'The delay has really been to the disadvantage of companies here,' Schulman says. 'Generally, the government wants to promote the advancement of science and technology. In this case, the government has done exactly the opposite and thwarted the ability of small, startup companies to develop commercial applications for this revolutionary technology.' Man with a plan: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos unveiled the controversial drones during an interview with 60 Minutes . Amazon isn't the only company awaiting guidelines. A Domino's franchise in the United Kingdom released a test flight video in June of the 'DomiCopter,' a drone used to deliver hot pizza. The FAA said Monday that it is moving forward with 'regulations and standards for the safe integration of remote piloted (drones) to meet increased demand.' The agency reiterated that 'autonomous (drone) operation is not currently allowed in the United States.' Given the slow pace at which the FAA typically approves regulations, Bezos' prediction of four or five years for approval seems unrealistic to many. Safety concerns could be the real obstacle in delaying drones for widespread commercial use. 'You're putting a device with eight rapidly spinning blades into areas where people are assumed to be,' says Matt Waite, a journalism professor at the University of Nebraska and head of the university's Drone Journalism Lab. 'The threat to people on the ground is significant.' According to Amazon's website, the goal of the new delivery system is to get packages into customers' hands in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles . It's not hard to imagine that the world's biggest online retailer has some significant lobbying muscle and might be able to persuade the FAA to alter the rules. Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako says the company has been in contact with the FAA 'as they are actively working on necessary regulation.' One of the biggest promises for civilian drone use is in agriculture because of the industry's largely unpopulated, wide open spaces. Delivering Amazon packages in midtown Manhattan will be much trickier. But the savings of such a delivery system only come in large, urban areas. Besides regulatory approval, Amazon's biggest challenge will be to develop a collision avoidance system, says Darryl Jenkins, a consultant who gave up on the commercial airline industry and now focuses on drones. Who is to blame, Jenkins asked, if the drone hits a bird, crashes into a building? Who is going to insure the deliveries? There are also technical questions. Who will recharge the drone batteries? How many deliveries can the machines make before needing service? Spanning the country: The drones are being tested over a 10-mile radius at the moment but Bezos says that will work for most urban areas . 'Jeff Bezos might be the single person in the universe who could make something like this happen,' Jenkins says. 'For what it worth, this is a guy who's totally changed retailing.' If Amazon gets its way, others might follow. United Parcel Service Co. executives heard a presentation from a drone vendor earlier this year, says Alan Gershenhorn, UPS' chief sales, marketing and strategy officer. 'Commercial use of drones is an interesting technology, and we're certainly going to continue to evaluate it,' Gershenhorn says. The U.S. Postal Service and FedEx wouldn't speculate about using drones for delivery.","Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has announced the online retailer has secretly been testing drones that will delivery packages directly to people's doors .

Fast cars, speedboats, yachts … these three men lived a life of luxury, and were more than happy to flaunt their apparent good fortune to the world. Except Richard Pope, Paul Gunter and Simon Odoni didn’t owe their flashy lifestyles to luck. They owed them to an elaborate scam which fleeced 2,300 people out of £85million. The three conmen have now been jailed for a total of 43 years at a court in America. 'Arrogant': Paul Gunter, seen aboard Richard Pope's boat No Slack, had built up a portfolio of 26 homes using money stolen from thousands of victims . Their ‘boiler room’ investment scam was the biggest the UK  has ever seen, and destroyed hundreds of lives. Marriages broke up, retired  professionals were forced to go back to work after losing all their savings, and one distraught man killed himself after being cheated out of £200,000. Meanwhile Pope, 55, Gunter, 64, and Odoni, 56, were busy frittering away their victims’ cash, buying dozens of properties and extravagant luxuries including Ferraris and a £350,000 private plane. They arrogantly flaunted their wealth – one photograph shows  Pope making an obscene hand gesture as he posed in his convertible. 'Ruthless': Richard Pope, seen making a rude gesture at the wheel of his sports car, used the proceeds of the trio's £85million fraud to fund a lavish lifestyle . Boiler-room fraud: Simon Odoni, 56, who had been hiding in the Dominican Republic to avoid extradition for his crimes, was caught after a flight he was on was forced to divert and land on U.S. soil . The trio were jailed at a court in Tampa, Florida, marking the conclusion of a seven-year transatlantic investigation that stretched from Spain to the UK and eventually the US, where they will serve their sentences. Detective Inspector Kerrie Gower of City of London police, who led the inquiry, described the scam as fraud ‘committed on a truly massive scale’. She said: ‘Pope, Gunter and Odoni are amongst the most ruthless and destructive criminals the City of London police have ever dealt with and deserve every day they will spend behind bars.’ The three employed staff in Spanish call centres who rang British homes selling shares in companies that did not exist. Jet-set lifestyle: Gunter, above left, and Pope, above right, ripped off UK investors for millions along with Odoni to pay for their sports cars, holiday homes and private jet hire . Lavish: Cabanas line the shore at the Dominican beach property snapped up by Paul Gunter with the proceeds of the boiler-room scam . These ‘investments’ were then funnelled into US bank accounts belonging to the conmen. The majority of their victims  were retired professionals whose losses ranged from a few hundred pounds to £1million. Many were left penniless. One devastated victim, 44-year-old Mark Goswami from Huddersfield, took his own life, leaving a wife and daughter. The boiler room scam began  in 2004 when Pope, Gunter, and Odoni stole details of dormant publicly traded US companies.  The term ‘boiler room’ refers to  the cheap offices that are used to do the selling. In the case of Pope, Gunter, and Odoni, they employed hundreds of staff in call centres in Spain who made 50 cold calls every day selling the bogus shares. Party's over: British fraudsters Gunter, left, and Odoni, right, have so far shown no remorse, police say . Jailed: Pope and his accomplices employed hundreds of staff in call centres in Spain to phone potential victims and persuade them to buy shares . Bad business: The scam run by Pope (pictured), Odoni and Gunter was one of the biggest of its kind ever uncovered in the UK . Ill-gotten gains: The red Ferrari owned by jailed fraudster Simon Odoni, who is originally from St Albans . Fleet of cars: From top, a Nissan Titan, Nissan Frontier and Nissan 350Z belonging to Gunter . They used glossy brochures to make the . investments seem credible and set up a fake website to make it look as . if stocks were moving up and down, encouraging the victims to invest . more money. According to the indictment issued by . the Middle District  of Florida US Attorney’s office,  the salesmen . employed ‘high  pressure and misleading’ selling techniques, such as . saying their own families had invested money in the scheme. It all fell apart in 2011 when Pope, originally from St Albans in Hertfordshire, was arrested in Spain. He was extradited to the US, where he admitted mail and wire fraud and testified against the other two. Odoni, also from St Albans, tried to skip bail in Britain by moving to the Dominican Republic where he spent his days in a waterfront cabana he bought from the proceeds of the scam. He was caught when a plane he was travelling on had engine trouble and diverted to Miami, where he was arrested. Odoni and Gunter, who is originally from London, went on trial in March and were found guilty of mail fraud, money laundering and wire fraud charges. But their refusal to plead guilty meant that three of their British victims, including  Mr Goswami’s widow, had to fly from the UK to Florida to face them in court. Detective Inspector Gower added: ‘These were arrogant  criminals who were just ripping off UK investors, taking as much as they could from them and  having criminal lifestyles, lavish lifestyles, whereby they were purchasing boats, a plane and high value vehicles. ‘We have 26 properties down in relation to Paul Gunter alone.’ Police said he and Odoni have so far shown no remorse. Gunter was sentenced to 25 years and Odoni to 13 years and four months. Pope was sentenced to four years and nine months. Four others were also charged in connection with the scam. Life of luxury: The group even purchased a plane similar to the one pictured . One of the victims of an £85 million fraud where investors were tricked into buying worthless shares was driven to suicide after losing thousands of pounds. Mark Goswami killed himself in October 2007, just three days after he had gone to police to raise concerns that he had been conned. His widow Andrea, 48, who described the former retail manager as 'a very proud, kind and intelligent man', said he was 'devastated' when he discovered what had happened. 'They made me feel sick': Mark Goswani's widow Andrea flew to the U.S. to face the fraudsters in court . She was one of three of Richard Pope, Paul Gunter and Simon Odoni's British victims who flew to Florida to face them in court. 'It was very difficult to go,' the mother-of-one said. 'It was one of the hardest things I had to do, to go into that courtroom. 'I couldn't actually look at them. I couldn't actually bring myself to look at them. 'When I was giving evidence I knew that if I did I would crack and I wouldn't be able to carry on. It was only as I was walking out of the courtroom I looked sideways and that was it. 'They made me feel physically sick.' Her husband began working from home in 2005, having given up his job as a retail manager, and made an income trading on the fluctuations of foreign exchange markets and investing in shares.In 2007 he began getting cold calls from the fraudsters, and eventually in September that year he confessed to his wife that he may have lost thousands. He lost more than £70,000 to Pope, Gunter and their accomplices. Mrs Goswami said: 'He wasn't eating, wasn't sleeping, he was all over the place. He was constantly on the computer, he didn't take a break. 'He was very upset, he was very devastated.' She discovered that the address given by the investment company IMG was in fact a model agency, and could find no official records for the firm. After her husband died, she was determined to continue the fight for justice. Mrs Goswami said: 'I just tried to get every bit of paper that I could find to do with his investments. 'I looked at the computer, trawled through the computer to see what he had been doing, who he'd spoken to; looked at contacts, his diary. 'It's been a very traumatic time. I wanted to understand what boiler room fraud was, because I didn't know such a thing existed. 'I needed to get this done for my husband's sake, to finish something that he'd started."" She said no jail term will be long enough for the devastation they have caused to her and her 14-year-old daughter Grace. 'I'm very, very angry, and no sentence in my eyes will be long enough for what they've done, the damage that they've done, not just for myself and Grace, but all those victims, all those people. 'They've defrauded whole families, just destroyed their dreams for their families' futures. I want my daughter to go to university, she's a bright girl. 'They've left us with nothing. I know money doesn't make you happy, but obviously you think about your future and your family's future. 'Some people think that being defrauded means that they're stupid people. But they couldn't possibly have known that they were being defrauded like that.'","Paul Gunter, Richard Pope and Simon Odoni lived life of luxury in U.S.

China boasts world's largest and quickest-growing high-speed rail network but there has been evidence of corruption after a crash that killed 40 people . Mr Cameron responded with comments made in the city’s political hub, the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square. He said it was right to explore ‘all the opportunities of economic openness – openness of Britain to Chinese investment’. He added that there had been ‘huge amounts in recent months and years’. The Prime Minister declared there were also ‘opportunities for further opening our trade relations and building on our trade and business relations’. However, there is controversy over allowing China, a former Cold War enemy, to take a critical stake in key infrastructure projects. Li Keqiang said he also wanted to steo up 'co-operation' over nuclear power and invest in UK energy projects . There is controversy over allowing the former Cold War enemy to take a critical stake in key infrastructure projects . Already ministers have allowed the Chinese to take a 30 per cent stake in a new nuclear plant at  Hinkley Point, Somerset. But yesterday it became clear China has far greater ambitions. These include investing in new nuclear projects and the proposed HS2 line from London to the Midlands and North. Downing Street sources said Chinese investment could cut the cost of the rail scheme to British taxpayers. China boasts the world’s largest and quickest-growing high-speed rail network. But there has been evidence of corruption and public alarm after a crash near Wenzhou, eastern China, killed 40 in 2011. After meeting Mr Cameron and senior ministers, Mr Li said they ‘agreed to push for breakthroughs and progress’ in co-operation on nuclear power and high-speed rail. Mr Li said they 'agreed to push for breakthroughs and progress' in co-operation on nuclear power . ‘The Chinese side is willing to not only participate in but also purchase equities and stocks in UK power projects,’ he added. Mr Li welcomed Mr Cameron’s recognition of the ‘territorial  integrity’ of China, diplomatic  code for accepting Beijing’s rule over Tibet. David Cameron protested to President Xi Jinping at the ‘completely inappropriate’ banning of a British journalist from a press conference. Robert Hutton had to wait outside as other reporters heard Mr Cameron and Premier Li Keqiang speak. Mr Hutton is based in London for US news agency Bloomberg, which has apparently caused anger with stories on the wealth of relatives of President Xi. The Prime Minister said: ‘China’s transformation is one of the defining facts of our lifetime. I see  China’s rise as an opportunity for Britain and for the world. ‘Some want to shut China off behind a bamboo curtain of trade barriers. Britain wants to tear those trade barriers down.’ Former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, in an apparent reference to human rights and Tibet, said: ‘It seems that Cameron is putting interests before principles. Some will like that, others not.’ Joe Rukin, of Stop HS2, said any Chinese involvement ‘blows apart any idea it is about creating British jobs and underlines that HS2 is all about the vanity of politicians’. A poll for BBC Radio 5 Live yesterday revealed 52 per cent of Britons oppose the project. Only 38 per cent back HS2 in the survey of 1,000-plus people by ComRes.","Premier Li Keqiang wants to invest in £50billion High Speed 2 scheme .

You could travel to work reading a magazine or chatting on your mobile at the wheel, before leaving your car to park itself, if Volvo's vision of autonomous cars becomes a popular reality . The company claims it is the first large-scale autonomous driving pilot project on public roads that will see if the technology can cope with everyday driving conditions in a bustling city. Self-driving cars will use approximately 37 miles (50 km) of selected roads in and around Gothenburg, which have been identified as ‘typical commuter arteries’ and include motorway conditions and roads with frequent traffic jams. ‘Our aim is for the car to be able to handle all possible traffic scenarios by itself, including leaving the traffic flow and finding a safe “harbour” if the driver for any reason is unable to regain control,’ said Erik Coelingh, Technical Specialist at Volvo Car Group. The Swedish auto giant is set to unleash 100 self-driving cars onto the streets of Gothenburg in 2017 in a large scale experiment to take robotic cars a step closer to accident-free driving . The self-driving technology used in the pilot scheme will allow people to hand over control to the car when circumstances are appropriate. The vehicles – adapted from the new Volvo XC90 – which will be used in the experiment, can handle all driving functions from steering and braking to parking. The car will be able to park itself, without the driver inside it, allowing someone to ditch their car at the entrance of a car park to let the vehicle go through the tedious task of finding somewhere to park.

Håkan Samuelsson, President and CEO of Volvo Car Group, said: ‘Autonomous vehicles are an integrated part of Volvo Cars’ as well as the Swedish government’s vision of zero traffic fatalities. This public pilot represents an important step towards this goal.’ ‘It will give us an insight into the technological challenges at the same time as we get valuable feedback from real customers driving on public roads,’ he added. Self-driving cars will use approximately 50 kilometres of selected roads in and around Gothenburg, which have been identified as 'typical commuter arteries' (pictured) and include motorway conditions and roads with frequent traffic jam . Experts will look at infrastructure requirements for autonomous driving, customers’ confidence in the technology and how ‘real’ drivers interact with an autonomous vehicle on the road. ‘The public pilot will provide us with a valuable insight into the societal benefits of making autonomous vehicles a natural part of the traffic environment. ‘Smart vehicles are part of the solution, but a broad societal approach is also necessary to offer sustainable personal mobility in the future, said Mr Coelingh. Volvo said autonomous driving will pave the way for more efficient time-management behind the wheel so that people can interact safely via phone or tablets (pictured) or choose to relax on the way to work . The project will begin next year with customer research and technology development and the first cars are expected to be on the roads in Gothenburg by 2017.

Still, with a little help from actress Barbara Windsor the Duchess of Cornwall managed to pull off a billion euro charity deal today. The actress giggled her way through the event with the Duchess as the pair worked the phones. Shrugging her shoulders in bewilderment as she juggled phones on the trading floor, Camilla admitted she was utterly flummoxed as fancy dress-clad brokers frantically traded around her. Deal: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and British actress Barbara Windsor took part in the ICAP Charity Day . Got the giggles: Camilla and Barbara Windsor seemed to enjoy themselves, as did TV presenter Gaby Roslin . Fair trade: Actress Barbara Windsor appeared to be getting into the spirit of things as she worked the phones . Strictly Come Dancing judge, Craig Revel Horwood, also helped with the day and the Duchess joked with him as they tried to work out what to do. Turning to Mr Revel Horwood, whom she . has known for many years through their shared charity work, she said: 'I . have no idea whatsoever what I am meant to be doing!' The Australian-born choreographer just laughed and said: 'Darling, it’s all gorgeous, let’s just do this!' In the end they did – doing a deal for a 'yard' of euros, trading slang for one billion -  which netted £23,000 for charities the Duchess supports. Broker Jonathan Gravestock said afterwards: 'It was huge deal, five times the size of our usual deal, and normally takes days to set up. She was a good sport.' Camilla was on the trading floor of City firm ICAP, a leading markets operator. Each year it gives away all its revenue and commissions on a chosen day to charity and since 1993 has raised £100 million worldwide. Camilla agreed to take part this year as donations will this year be made to two organisations of which she is patron.

Craig Revel-Horwood looks thrilled as he realises that he's made £23,000 for charity .

The royal’s mother and grandmother both died from the debilitating condition. Dressed in a smart blue tweed suit and pearls, the Duchess took the hustle and bustle of the floor in her stride and didn’t bat an eyelid at the often outlandish fancy dress outfits that the brokers wore for the day. She happily posed for photographs with gladiators, killer clowns,  basketball players and even a team of Moldovian Eurovision Song Contest entrants – whatever that may be. Down at the i-swap Beach Party, she roared as she was greeted by two female financiers wearing inflatable Sumo outfits and bikinis and even tried her hand at their interactive surfing game (although she declined the proffered glass of Malibu and pineapple). Surprise! The Danish dealer at the other end of the phone was surprised to find himself talking to Camilla . Unusual: Some of the brokers had arrived in fancy dress, including this pair of female sumo wrestlers . After conducting a dollar swap with the Duchess, broker Richard Mason said: 'She did well. She seemed a little nervous but probably not as nervous as I am. I was shaking.' Emerging markets broker Duncan Fotheringham also helped Camilla with another deal and added: 'She’s just dealt with Copenhagen and closed a trade, superbly, I might add, with a lot of style and panache.' Other celebrities on the floor included Homeland actor Damian Lewis and Barbara Windsor, who also campaigns for the National Osteoporosis Society. Camilla told the actress: 'I’ve not idea what we are doing but will try to do my best.' Barbara replied: 'Nor have I, we could get into trouble you know.' Speaking afterwards Mr Revel Horwood, who is a patron of the National Osteoporosis Society, said the Duchess had been 'huge fun'. Spooky: A surprisingly cheerful skeleton watched as Camilla took on a Danish broker in Copenhagen . Colourful: Other workers, dressed as hippies, waited by the ICAP front entrance to greet Camilla . 'I couldn’t quite believe what we were doing or the figure we were talking about.

A new drug-free gel, called Flexiseq, is set to bring relief to Britain's nine million arthritis sufferers . A new drug-free gel may bring relief to Britain’s nine million osteoarthritis sufferers. It can be rubbed into painful joints twice a day and, because it is drug-free, it is not thought to cause any dangerous side effects . Researchers carried out six clinical studies involving 4,000 patients and found Flexiseq can reduce pain and improve the mobility of osteoarthritis sufferers. One study of 1,300 patients found it creates a natural lubricant for the joints and is as good for pain relief as commonly prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It was published in Rheumatology - the British Society of Rheumatology’s official journal. Dr John Dickson, a co-founder of the Primary Care Rheumatology Society, worked on the study. He said: ‘It is well recognised that effectively managing chronic pain, particularly in patients with other conditions and risk factors, is a massive challenge that GPs and patients face on a daily basis. ‘This topical treatment is drug-free and seems to have an excellent safety profile.’ The water-based gel is made up of millions of droplets of fat, called phospholipids, which travel through the skin and tissue, penetrating the joint. They then coat the cartilage with a layer of protective lubricant, replacing naturally occurring phospholipids which have been ruined by arthritis. This reduces friction between adjoining bones, resulting in less pain and better mobility. Professor Philip Conaghan, from the University of Leeds, who led the research, said: ‘The need for new treatment options is well recognised as existing treatments don’t always work and many can cause serious side effects. ‘Many [osteoarthritis] patients are elderly and have additional health conditions that mean they are especially at risk of these side effects. The water-based gel contains millions of fat particles which penetrate the joint and act as a lubricant between the bones. This increases mobility and reduces pain . ‘Safety is therefore a key concern for new therapies and patients and healthcare professionals would welcome new treatment options which are effective and without such safety concerns.’ The gel, produced by company Pro Bono Bio, was developed in Germany and is already available in Germany and Ireland. It was awarded Innovation of 2013 by the Federal Association of German Pharmacists. Michael Earl, chief operating officer of Pro Bono Bio, said: ‘The proven physical mode of action and the lack of an active pharmaceutical ingredient give Flexiseq the best of both worlds – it works, and it’s safe.’ Until January the gel is only available from Arthritis Research UK and LloydsPharmacy. After that it will be available in all pharmacies at £16.80 per tube.","Flexiseq - a water-based gel - can be rubbed into painful joints twice a day .

It seems Google has become a little prudish with its latest Android KitKat operating system - especially when it comes to feminine hygiene and sex. A list of banned phrases has revealed the tech giant will offer predictive suggestions when a user types the words ‘marijuana’ and ‘bong’, but refuses to offer help for words such as ‘condom’, 'Tampax' 'braless' ‘intercourse’ and even ‘geek’. The words were discovered in the source code of the new software by Wired.com  and Google has declined to comment on why and how it made the choices. Wired.com has discovered a list of banned Android words, including 'intercourse', 'condom' and even 'geek'. When an Android user is typing they can enable predictive text suggestions to appear above the keyboard, pictured. Google then guesses which word they're trying to write but won't show any words on the banned list . Selection of banned words Google doesn't show in its predictive text tool: . Sex, intercourse, lovemaking, coitus, penis, vagina, irrumination, pizzle, butt, panty, braless, Tampax, preggers, suck, screw, geek, Chromebook, thud. Allowed controversial words: Marijuana, bong, methamphetamine, Nazi . So-called banned words aren’t words that Google will physically stop users from typing. Instead they are words that don't feature in its built-in predictive text dictionary. For example, when an Android user is typing texts or emails, they can enable predictive text suggestions to appear above the keys. As the user types, Google will try and guess which word they are trying to write and offer a list to choose from. To make typing faster, users can select the word from this list rather than manually typing the word. It also speeds things up when people use the swiping feature, which lets them swipe over the letters rather than selecting them individually. According to the list of words discovered by Wired’s Jon Christian, if a user starts to type the words ‘sex’, ‘intercourse’ or ‘lovemaking’, Google will not show them as suggestions. Typing the word ‘condom’ gives suggestions for ‘condition’ or ‘confusion’. Many of the banned words relate to reproduction, genitalia and swearing, however there are a number of words that Google won't offer suggestions for because it doesn't recognise that the words exist. This includes Chromebook, the name of Google's very own range of laptops, pictured . Google isn’t the only company guilty of partly censoring words in messages; a report in July discovered Apple does similar. Analysis from news website Daily . Beast found that iPhone handsets running iOS 6 will not suggest . corrections for words considered to be sensitive or provocative. Researchers used the built-in spell . checker in the iOS API developer platform to test more than 250,000 . words and discovered that suggestions do not apply for words including . 'abortion', 'bullet', 'suicide' and 'pornography' when they have been . mistyped. The report found that from the 165,000-word dictionary built into Android KitKat, 1,400 English words have been deemed inappropriate. Words for genitalia are banned, as are certain medical terms relating to genitalia, including ‘irrumination’. The word ‘butt’ is banned, as is ‘panty’, feminine hygiene brand ‘Tampax’ and ‘preggers’ among others that relate to reproduction or sexually transmitted diseases. Words that aren’t generally considered offensive and don’t relate to human anatomy yet are still on the list include ‘geek’ and ‘thud.’ Christian also points out the word ‘supremacist’ is banned, but ‘Nazi’ isn’t. Swear words are blocked from appearing automatically, but that list includes the word ‘pizzle’ – on old English word for penis. Words including ‘suck’ and ‘screw’ also don’t show up as suggestions, which was the case in Android Jelly Bean too. Many of these banned words are recognised, once they’ve been manually typed, and Google knows if they’ve been spelt correctly or not. However, other words Google doesn’t even recognise as words include Chromebook – the name for its own brand of laptops.","List of words were found in the source code for Android’s KitKat software .

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 08:03 EST, 27 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:11 EST, 27 June 2013 . The mother of a teenager who died after going into cardiac arrest last year is suing Monster Beverage Corp., claiming his death was caused by the company's caffeinated energy drink. Alex Morris, 19, from Silver Spring, Maryland, suffered cardiac arrest during the early morning hours of July 1 and was later pronounced dead in hospital. His mother, Paula Morris, is now suing the drinks company, claiming her son drank two cans a day every day for the three years leading up to his death, as well as on the day he died. Her lawyers previously filed a lawsuit on behalf of the family of Anais Fournier, a 14-year-old girl who died in 2011 after consuming two 24-ounce cans of the drink in a day. Missed: Alex Morris, 19, is pictured with his mother Paula, who is suing Monster Beverages Corp. after her son died last year. She blames his death on how he drank two of their drinks every day for three years . 'Our allegations in the lawsuits are the same and that's the peoples deaths were caused by these energy drinks and, more specifically, the defendants failure to warn about the dangers,' said Alexander Wheeler, an attorney representing the plaintiffs in both cases. 'Consumers need to know that these . energy drinks can be dangerous, and even lethal, especially to young . people and people with heart problems. 'It's especially important that . consumers learn about these risks because the energy drink companies do . not put appropriate warnings on the cans or their advertisements . telling people about these dangers.' Following Alex's death, the Alameda . County Coroner determined that his cause of death was . cardiac arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy. Powerful: The company claims that the drink has safe levels of caffeine but says its target is for over 18s . Monster and other energy drinks have . received increased scrutiny in recent months. The Food and Drug . Administration is investigating reports of deaths linked to energy . drinks, including five that cite Monster beverages, but the agency noted . that the reports don't prove the drinks caused the deaths. The agency also has been investigating at least 13 deaths linked to 5-hour Energy drink. Monster has previously said its target . market is 18 to 34 years old but that its drinks are nevertheless safe . for children as well. It has stood by the safety of its . drinks, which it says contain 240 milligrams of caffeine for a 24-ounce . can, compared with 330 milligrams in a 16-ounce cup of Starbucks coffee. Monster's current label says drinkers should limit themselves to one can every four hours and a maximum of three per day. It also says the drink isn't recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant women or women who are nursing. But San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera has pointed out that three cans amount to 480 milligrams of caffeine, nearly five times the recommended maximum for adolescents and above the 400 milligrams per day the FDA has indicated is safe for adults. The autopsy and toxicity reports found no illegal drugs or alcohol in his system. A cardiac arrhythmia is an electrical problem . with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat, meaning it can beat too . slow or too fast. When this occurs, the heart may not pump enough blood . to the brain and other organs, which could result in the loss of . consciousness or death. Speaking with the Globe Newswire, Paula Morris remembered her son as 'compassionate, funny, smart... he lived a life full of love and courage' - and she said they would not stop fighting for him. 'It is . hard for all of Alex's family and friends to relive the terrible moments . of his death,' she said. 'But we cannot be silent while more seemingly-healthy . young adults like Alex are putting their lives at risk, and we do not . want any other parents to experience the devastation of losing their . child.' Monster representatives did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Monster has previously said its target market is for 18 to 34 year olds but that its drinks are nevertheless safe for children as well. It said that in Fournier's case, no blood test was performed to confirm she died of 'caffeine toxicity' as the suit claimed, saying she died of natural causes brought on by pre-existing conditions. The cause of death on her autopsy report was 'cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine toxicity complicating mitral valve regurgitation in the setting of Ehler's-Danlos syndrome' - a heart condition. The company also said that evidence obtained as part of the lawsuit's discovery process shows Anais regularly had energy drinks and frequented Starbucks without incident. Deaths: Morris died months after the death of 14-year-old Anais Fournier, who also consumed Monster energy drinks. Her family is also suing the company, claiming that it is responsible for her death . Missed: Morris, pictured with family members, has been remembered as a compassionate and funny teen .

'Energy drinks contain massive and excessive amounts of caffeine that may lead to a host of health problems in young people, including heart problems, and banning companies from marketing these products to adolescents is a common sense action that we can take to protect the health of American kids,' AMA board member Dr. Alexander Ding said in a June 18 statement.","Maryland teenager Alex Morris went into cardiac arrest in July last year .

The cost of Christmas dinner doesn’t have to put your festive budget in the red – because it’s possible to put a traditional spread on the table for as little as £2.73 a head. Turkey and trimmings, a traditional pudding, cake and mince pies can all be bought for as little as £21.85 for a family of eight – as long as you shop around. Experts at the Good Housekeeping Institute trawled the eight biggest food chains for their cheapest festive food – and found that Lidl had some of the best bargains. The cheapest turkey was available at the German-owned chain – where it is £9.99 for a Braemoor self-basting bird of up to 4.8kg. And for those who want to buy all the items on the menu in one shop, Lidl again was the best value option at £27.33, followed by Morrisons at £30.54 and Aldi at £31.70. Lidl, like rival Aldi, is gaining rapid popularity by tapping into a fundamental shift in shopping  habits among the middle classes, which has been driven by the austerity of the past five years. With many families deserting the more expensive supermarkets in search of ways to cut the weekly shopping bill, the firm is plotting an ambitious expansion drive that will see the number of stores more than double from 600 to 1,500. In the survey, Lidl also had the cheapest sprouts, which were 99p for 1kg, while the brandy butter from the budget store and Aldi was a rock-bottom £1.49. Potatoes were cheapest at Aldi, costing £1.38 for two bags of Maris Piper. Best value Christmas puddings came from the Morrisons M Savers range at £1.98 for two. Its 400g Christmas cake, at two for £3, was also good value. Feast on a shoestring: The cost of Christmas dinner doesn't have to put your festive budget in the red . The cheapest mince pies came from Sainsbury’s at 63p for eight, while the store’s parsnips cost just £1 per kg. Tesco was among the cheapest for stuffing mix and cranberry sauce, while Asda did well on cake and stuffing mix. The cost of a budget Christmas dinner has risen since last year –but by just £1.73. The increase from £20.12 is only 8.5 per cent, but it comes as the cost of living crisis continues to squeeze household spending. The Institute’s experts tried to make a like-for-like comparison of the budget ranges of the eight stores in its survey. Bargain hunters: Experts at the Good Housekeeping Institute  trawled the eight biggest food chains for their cheapest festive food . The total basket price for the fourth cheapest grocer, Asda, was £33.12, with Tesco at £34.03, Iceland at £35.75, Sainsbury’s at £39.04 and the Co-op at £39.89. Unsurprisingly, Waitrose was the most expensive at £53.15, while Marks & Spencer came in at £51.29. Both were almost double the Lidl figure of £27.33. The Good Housekeeping Institute has been comparing prices for five years and says its figures help to cut through the hype and price-cutting claims made by the stores themselves. Its consumer director, Caroline Bloor, said: ‘Every year our budget basket picks out the cheapest options for everything from turkey to mince pies across all the supermarkets and tells you where to go for a one-stop shop. ‘With the individual supermarkets claiming they’re the cheapest for Christmas dinner, we’re the ones comparing prices independently.’","Experts at Good Housekeeping Institute found that Lidl had best bargains .

There is nothing like a glass of wine after a long day, but some Brits hold off on this pleasure longer than others . It is a moment many of us look forward to – but it seems that some of us wait longer than others to pour our first evening drink. For while the average Brit uncorks the wine or takes the top off the gin bottle at 7.36pm, a new survey has revealed something of a North-South divide when it comes to savouring the first alcoholic drink of the day, with the residents of Brighton proving the most thirsty. They open the door of the drinks cabinet at 5pm, some three hours behind the surprisingly restrained Scots who wait, on average, until 8pm. The Welsh, meanwhile, mark the end of the working day with a drink at 6.30pm, while the citizens of London, Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle kick back at 7pm, followed by Oxford, Cambridge and Leeds at 7.30 pm. The findings, from a survey of three thousand adults aged between 18 and 60 taken last month by market research company OnePoll, form part of the first nationwide report into the nation’s drinking habits commissioned by drinks website Thebar.com. It found that the UK’s drinking habits have changed in the last decade, with an increased preference for sour-flavoured drinks. Vodka, however, remains the UK’s bestselling spirit, followed closely by gin, which has enjoyed a fifteen percent increase in sales in the last decade. That, however, is nothing compared to the renaissance of rum, whose sales have increased by 23 percent in the last ten years as the nation embraces the art of making cocktails at home. When they’re out, though, the nation’s barmen report a growing preference for sour-flavoured cocktails and more traditional mixed drinks over the last decade, with the whisky-based Old Fashioned and citrus flavoured Gin Fizz making a comeback. Our tastebuds seem to be changing when it comes to beer too, with sales of Belgian Sour up 31 per cent last year alone, making it the second-fastest growing style of beer. Drinks like Strawberry and red pepper gin fizz (left) and Old Fashioned (right) are becoming popular again . The average Brit uncorks the wine or takes the top off the gin bottle at  7.36pm . Some things remain reasonably constant however: with the festive season just around the corner, the report found that Baileys remains the top Christmas drink – with the traditionally whiskey-drinking Scots proving to be the top consumers. They stock 16 per cent of the country’s Baileys in their drinks cupboard. A spokesperson for Thebar.com said. 'It is really interesting to see how different the nations drinking habits are and how our drink preference are changing. It seems the further north you go the later the average drink is poured. 'But what really stood out from our findings is that wherever we live we’re all becoming more savvy when it comes to food, cocktails and mixed drinks, with a better understanding or and passion for flavours. ’","On average we reach for alcohol at 7.36pm, but those in North wait longer .

Today, more than 2,500 military personnel were deployed to tackle the clashes, which became so violent that Ms Yingluck was forced to flee to a nearby compound.

It . was found that 7 per cent of those asked will leave their web shopping . until the day before Christmas, while another 7 per cent of respondents . will wait until after December 25 to buy gifts in online Boxing Day . sales. The busiest shopping day on the high . street often falls two days before Christmas Day, with Monday December . 23 and Tuesday December 24 expected to draw peak numbers of shoppers . this year. Total Christmas sales will be worth £72.2billion, the same as £351 per person, a 2.1 per cent rise on last year the Centre for Retail Research predicts. A third of that total figure will be online, they say. Shoppers will spend a total of 400 . million hours shopping online this December, putting it on track to be . the biggest ever year for online shopping. John . Lewis' online director Mark Lewis said the growth of online sales can . be attributed to an increase confidence in internet shopping. He said: 'Shopping habits have changed in the past few years. 'Customers are more comfortable purchasing via mobiles and tablets, and there is better connectivity.' Not satisfied with record sales on Monday, some researchers are predicting a middle Cyber Monday on December 9. Credit experts Experian expect more than 110 million visits to shopping sites on the day - saying it may even eclipse Cyber Monday. The company say the average customer will spend eight hours browsing, researching and buying presents online this December - a 7.5 per cent increase year on year.

'This Christmas is going to be the . biggest ever in terms of online retail visits and December 2013 should . be the first month that the UK reaches the three billion benchmark for . visits to retail websites,' said James Murray, digital insights manager . at Experian Marketing Services. Research . by retailer BrandAlley showed 88 per cent of buyers thought a gift must . be 50 per cent off it's recommended retail price before they would . consider it a bargain. 81 per cent said they expect retailers to be on sale all year round. Peak: Amazon say they are expecting a peak in sales towards the end of the day when people get home at work - at about 6pm . Figures suggest online shopping . generally is up 10.1 per cent in 2013 - compared to 2012, according to . Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of all card transactions in the . UK. Meanwhile, some of the . country's biggest shops have begun their January sales more than a . month early in a desperate bid to boost pre-Christmas sales. In previous years, stores have held off . heavy discounting into Boxing Day but they have been forced to act this . time round to entice cash-strapped shoppers. Shoppers will spend a £147 million pounds on Secret Santa gifts for work colleagues this year, new research reveals today. They'll splash out £7.10 on average, with socks and novelty mugs topping the uninspiring list of presents. Nearly one in 14 shoppers will buy deodorant for a colleague this Christmas, the study found. The . survey of 2,000 adults showed nearly a third of the nation will take . part in the gift-giving craze, with one in three considering it a 'great . British tradition'. One in four take advantage of the game's anonymity to buy their colleagues inappropriate gifts. The . survey from the British Heart Foundation found some jokers even fix the . present-swapping ritual to stir things up between office rivals. The decision to cut prices follows an unexpected slump in high street sales over recent months. Display windows in the country’s premier shopping destination, Oxford Street, London, are among those filled with sale signs. Clothing outlet H&M is offering customers up to 50% off, while department store Debenhams has dropped some of its prices by almost third. Jeweller H Samuel is offering items at half price, Topshop is advertising its flash sale and U.S. clothing chain Gap is running up to 40% off selected items. Others cutting prices include Mango, Miss Selfridge, Aldo, BHS, Dorothy Perkins, River Island and Esprit. The Metropolitan Police urged internet Christmas shoppers to exercise caution while making their purchases to avoid falling victim to fraudsters. Its new Cyber Crime Unit has put together a check-list for people buying on the web. Detective Chief Inspector Jason Tunn said: 'These are simple tips to keep safe while you shop online for your gifts for friends and family. 'The last thing anyone needs is for their details to be compromised by cyber criminals and online fraudsters - especially during the Christmas period. 'Hopefully these safeguards are easy to follow and can be implemented even by those with limited computer skills.' The tips include installing protection on one's computer with anti virus or full security suite products as well as not clicking into links sent out by unsolicited spam or phishing emails. Also suggested is using a credit card instead of a debit card - credit cards may offer increased protection, and being wary of unsolicited mail asking consumers to visit sites for cheap deals on hard to get items. These may contain links designed to compromise a person's computer and steal their credentials.","Online bargain hunters expected to splash out £900,000 a minute today .

It’s the most wonderful time of the year – the time when the Kardashians release their annual Christmas card. And of course, Kim had her heart set on being the centre of attention for the elaborate photo shoot. The reality star showcased the figure that made her famous in a show-stopping Yves Saint Laurent dress while smouldering for the camera for the 2013 card, which was unveiled on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Their most elaborate one yet: The Kardashians have released their annual family Christmas card, which was shot by David LaChapelle for 2013 . The 33-year-old’s frock had a very sexy keyhole cut-out, that allowed her to display plenty of her ample cleavage. The floor-length halter-neck gown hugged Kim’s curves in all the right places and had sequined sleeves and a split all the way up one side. Kim wore her blonde hair big and bouncy for the photo, which was shot by David LaChapelle, and topped off her look with purple heels. LaChapelle had asked her to spray her hair black, and when Kim declined he still wasn't happy after she had her locks styled, calling the look 'so normal' and claiming, 'I want a f***ing sex machine. Show-stopping: Kim is the centre of attention in the image, wearing a black gown with a keyhole cut-out to display her ample cleavage and a split all the way up one side . The big reveal: The family revealed this year's card on Keeping Up With The Kardashians: A Very Merry Christmas special . When Kim returned after having her tresses backcombed to the extreme, Bruce Jenner told her: 'Your hair is bigger than your ass.' The . card is the family’s most elaborate to date, and set in a . post-apocalyptic, chaotic casino with mannequin parts all over the . place, and a sea of tabloid magazines with various members of the clan . on the cover strewn across the floor. Kendall and Kylie were wearing headpieces and similar black dresses with side-splits, but while 16-year-old Kylie’s had long and billowing sleeves, 18-year-old Kendall’s was sleeveless and she paired it with opera gloves. Khloe and Kourtney were clad in black cocktail dresses, and while Kourtney held Penelope in her arms, Mason lounged on a chair beside Khloe, whose dress ripped during the shoot. Pulling out all the stops: Bruce Jenner is seen in a glass case, while Kris sat proudly atop a cashier and Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian lounged in the background with Kourtney's children Mason and Penelope . Giving Kim a run for her money was . her mother Kris Jenner, who hitched up her strapless dress and sat . regally and aptly on a cashier booth, wearing a Cleopatra inspired . headdress. Meanwhile Bruce was sporting long hair and a tuxedo while inside a case, forlornly pressed up against the glass. The family are surrounded by blown up photos of Kim in her younger years, while TV screens behind Kris display further images of the famous family. Noticeably absent from the holiday card is Rob Kardashian, with the sock entrepreneur declining to participate after revealing he wasn't feeling up to it. It was previously revealed that the sisters’ significant others, Scott Disick, Lamar Odom, and Kanye West, as well as Kim’s baby daughter North, would not be taking part in the festivities. Sister act: Kendall (R) and Kylie Jenner wore similar black dresses while stood amongst various tabloid magazines with members of the famous family on the cover . Hat's nice: Kylie was clearly excited about her look for the card and on Sunday shared a photo on Instagram in which she can be seen showing off her silver headdress . The decision to feature solely the women . in the family, aside from Bruce and Mason, was that of David . LaChapelle’s, and the famed photographer was not keen on the idea of . Kourtney’s children being involved either. But the 34-year-old wasn’t having it and said firmly during the Keeping Up With The Kardashians: A Very Merry Christmas special: ‘I really think my kids should be part of it. I know he is an artist but it’s still our family Christmas card. They will be in it.’ Bruce also was resolved that he would be featuring, and told Kendall: ‘It’s not the girls’ Christmas card, it’s our family Christmas card. We’ve done it for 23 years and they want to change it? It’s your mom’s and my Christmas card.’ The card is certainly a far stretch from the clan’s 2012 Christmas card, which featured the entire family, complete with children, partners and pets, celebrating together while dressed in all-white. What a difference a year makes: The family's holiday card for 2012 was a lot more low-key, and showed all of the clan celebrating while dressed in white .","Shot by acclaimed photographer David LaChapelle .

For most football fans, the ultimate display of loyalty to their team is a tattoo sporting the side's colours or crest. But one Newcastle United fan has taken his love for the Geordie club to new extremes. Andrew Canavan has had the club's emblem etched onto his glass eye in a bid to find a unique way to show where his loyalties lie. Die hard fan: Andrew Canavan, pictured at St James's Park, shows off his glass eye etched with the Newcastle United crest . Unusual request: Mr Canavan had to get special permission to use the club's trademarked crest . The 35-year-old spent a year trying to secure permission from Newcastle United to use their logo - a registered trademark - before finally getting the go ahead this summer. The glass eye, made by a specialist in Blackpool for just over Â£150, arrived at his home in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, earlier this week and Andrew says he is 'over the moon' with the creation. The demolition worker plans to wear the glass eye everyday and says he has had a brilliant reaction from friends and family. However, he adds that he's had some 'grief' from rival fans for taking his love of Newcastle to the extreme. He said: 'I've had some snide comments from Sunderland fans on Facebook, but that is only to be expected. 'When some people lose an eye they are devastated, but I saw it as an opportunity to do something unique. Glass eye: Andrew had his eye removed 20 years ago when a detached retina caused bleeding from his pupil which turned his eye red . 'I have always been a Newcastle United fan. Where I come from, you don't choose what club you support, you are born into it. 'My dad was a Newcastle fan, and my granddad. 'This is the ultimate tribute to Newcastle United.' Andrew, a father-of-three, added: 'It took us ages to persuade Newcastle United to allow me to use the emblem because it is a registered trademark. 'To start with they thought I was taking the mick, but when they realised how sincere I was they said they were happy for me to go ahead.' The football fanatic's baby Delly, nineteen-months-old, has been pointing and laughing at the eye since he started wearing it on Monday. Delighted: Andrew shows the crest on his glass eye, which arrived at his Bishop Auckland home this week . He said that his step-children Chloe, who is eight, and Jay, who is six, also think the etching is 'pretty cool'. Andrew's partner Emma Tray, 30, added: 'This does not surprise me at all. It is exactly the kind of mad thing Andrew would do.' Andrew had his eye removed 20 years ago when a detached retina caused bleeding from his pupil which turned his eye red. He was told by a doctor that he could keep the eye, but he made the decision to have it removed. Andrew added: 'I jumped at the chance to have it taken out, it was doing my head in. 'I couldn't be happier with my glass eye.' A spokesperson for Newcastle United said: 'It was certainly an unusual request but one that we were more than happy to assist with.'","Football fan Andrew Canavan, 35, had his eye removed 20 years ago .

Police are hunting a gang of rustlers who are believed to have shot six pigs with crossbows to try and kill them for meat. Farmer Jimmy Butler, 66, was horrified when he found three of his pregnant sows impaled with 14-inch crossbow bolts. Another two of his free-range pigs were missing after apparently being killed and taken from his field in Blythburgh, Suffolk. Farmer Jimmy Butler was horrified to discover his pigs had endured horrific wounds from crossbow bolts . Sickening: The pigs were all pregnant and the wounds will have caused them tremendous stress . A sixth pig had an open wound, suggesting it had also been shot and the bolt had fallen out of its body. Mr Butler who owns Blythburgh Free Range Pigs, said: 'It was distressing for my men, it was distressing for anyone who had to deal with it and most of all it was distressing for the pigs. 'It just makes you so angry because it's a wanton act of vandalism and the real ones to suffer are the pigs - what is the point of it?' 'The people who did this are just mindless individuals. They are no better than animals. It is just absolutely horrendous. 'The pigs would have suffered enormous stress. It was awful to see these darts sticking out of them. 'One had two bolts in its neck and the other two and one each in their sides. We will treat them with penicillin and they should recover. 'But the one with the open wound is very poorly and is likely to lose her piglets.' Four of the animals were found on Saturday with arrows imbedded in them and two other pigs are thought to have been killed and stolen . Mr Butler said his company supplied pork to some of Britain's top restaurants such as the Ivy and Savoy in London. He believes the pigs were targeted between 5pm last Friday and 5am on Saturday when his workers checked on them. The pigs were among a group of about 50 in an open pen in a field containing more than 500 of the animals. Each was a pregnant sow weighing 150kg to 200kg. A Suffolk Police spokesman said: 'We are appealing for information from anyone who saw anything suspicious.'","Farmer found his live pigs with crossbow bolts sticking out of their hides .

Milwaukee County officials have identified a man who died more than 12 years ago while trying to get help for his drinking problem at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. No one knew the name of 53-year-old Oliveros Perdomo when he walked into the Milwaukee meeting in 2001 and no friends or family came forward following his sudden death. He also had no identification on him when he collapsed beneath a sign that read, ‘But for the grace of God...’ Mystery solved: A man whose identity remained a mystery for 12 years after he slumped over dead in a 2001 Milwaukee AA meeting has been identified as this man, 53-year-old Oliveros Perdomo . Tests later revealed he died from a withdrawal seizure due to chronic alcoholism. ‘It was like he ran out of breath,’ AA member Jose Gonzalez said at the time. For months, authorities tried to identify him. Police showed his morgue photo to people in the neighborhood where he was last seen. The same photo appeared in newspapers and on television. People searching for missing loved ones became aware of the case, but left the morgue disappointed. ‘The case went cold,’ said Jenni Penn, an investigator for the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner, ‘but we never forgot about the guy.’ Better days: This photo provided by the Perdomo family shows Oliveros Perdomo with his wife Josefina Perdomo. It turns out Oliveros may have been trying to finally get sober in order to mend his relationship with Josefina when he died of a seizure brought on by alcohol withdraw . Interest in the case resurfaced after the medical examiner's office started loading data onto the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs. It was launched in July 2007 as a national repository and resource center for missing persons and unidentified decedent records. None of the office's dozen or so investigators are dedicated solely to identifying unknown bodies, and the office handles about 5,000 cases a year. As time allows, the office reviews dormant cases. ‘But a lot of these cases are not solved with technology,’ Penn said. ‘Sometimes they take some elbow grease.’ In October, Penn took Perdomo's fingerprints to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. No matches were found. Then she recognized that among several possible names listed, Perdomo's name appeared more than once. Penn also received information on Perdomo from a retired immigration file. ‘Before that, the dots did not connect,’ she said. According to the file, a person named Oliveros Perdomo was born Aug. 4, 1947, in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Josefina died in 2005 without ever having known what happened to Oliveros. Josefina's sons were contacted by a researcher with the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner and the puzzle was finally solved last week . A subsequent inquiry to the Social Security Administration revealed a 1992 Chicago address for Perdomo. Milwaukee County medical examiner's investigator Anne-Marie Eschle then located a Cook County, Illinois, small claims case from 1995 for Perdomo that included a woman at the address named Josefina Perdomo. She had died in 2005, but a request for her death certificate led to a Chicago funeral home, where contact information was obtained on her two sons. Penn called one of the sons, Alfredo Marquez, who said his mother and Perdomo were married in 1976, and that he had not seen his stepfather since late 2000 or 2001. Last week, Marquez viewed morgue and immigration photos and confirmed his stepfather's identity, Penn said. ‘This whole thing is like a miracle,’ said Jenni Penn, an investigator for the office. ‘It was like the timing was right. Everyone I asked to help helped.’ Marquez said his mother and stepfather separated over his drinking. ‘My mom told him if he didn't stop drinking, he needs to find somewhere else to live,’ Marquez said. ‘He left the house and never came back.’ When he died, he had no alcohol or drugs in his system. ‘I think he was trying to get help,’ Marquez said. ‘I think he was trying to get sober and show my mom he was a changed man.’ On Saturday, Marquez and his brother visited Perdomo's grave at Pilgrim's Rest Cemetery, where they finally were able to say goodbye. The brothers plan to install a headstone so their father will be identified permanently.","The man had no identification and no one at the Milwaukee AA meeting knew him .

Starting a three-day visit to China, the Prime Minister will propose a free trade deal between the EU and China . Sir Peter was once described as having ‘no known values’ but is now head of the Arts Council quango. Miss Brady is the Prime Minister’s new ambassador for small businesses, but has courted controversy by working for pornography barons in the past. Former England footballer Graeme Le Saux is on the trip representing the Premier League. However it is the inclusion of those with a connection to Mr Cameron that will add to the feeling that the Eton-educated Premier is happier dealing with privileged ‘cronies’ than those from more ordinary backgrounds. Apart from Viscount Astor they include Tory donor Howard Leigh and Lord Chadlington, Mr Cameron’s Oxfordshire neighbour and chairman of his Witney constituency association. Delegates: Footballer Graeme Le Saux, pictured left, and TV producer Peter Bazalgette, pictured right, are both business representatives on the trip . And Rohan Silva, a former Downing Street . aide to Mr Cameron, joined the trip representing financial services . company Index Ventures. Critics will say it is unfair that businessmen with links to Mr Cameron will be able to use contacts made on the trip to boost their firms’ profits, while those without links to the Prime Minister are denied such an opportunity. Viscount Astor gets a place thanks to his position as deputy chairman of TV production company Silvergate Media. Family: Viscount William Astor, the stepfather of David Cameron's wife, is also on the trip . Howard Leigh – who was given a peerage earlier this year – is listed on the business delegation as senior partner of financial services company Cavendish Corporate Finance. The former Tory party treasurer has given the Conservatives nearly £220,000 in his own name and on behalf of his company. Millionaire Lord Chadlington is on the trip as chief executive of PR firm Huntsworth Media. Mr Cameron faced questions recently about a £137,000 land deal with the peer, who spent a small fortune buying a house over the road from the Prime Minister’s Oxfordshire home so the Camerons could buy a chunk of its land later. Sir Andrew Witty, the head of a drugs firm embroiled in a multi-million pound Chinese bribery case, is on the trade trip. GlaxoSmithKline is the UK’s biggest pharmaceuticals firm, but has been rocked by state-backed allegations of £300million payments to doctors and officials. Four of the group’s employees have been arrested, while the company’s top Chinese executive fled the country in the wake of the accusations. Last night a spokesman for the Prime Minister said there was nothing untoward and that the delegation list was drawn up by UK Trade and Industry, the Foreign Office body which promotes overseas trade. ‘The list was drawn up by UKTI,’ he said. ‘They chose the most appropriate businesses to bring on the trip. The decision was made purely on business reasons.’","David Cameron is heading a trade delegation of 131 business reps to China .

Payday loan firms are using catchy tunes and funny puppets to ‘groom’ children to become the borrowers of the future, it was claimed yesterday. The firms stand accused of using daytime TV adverts to convince youngsters that the loans, which can charge more than 5,000 per cent APR interest, are normal. Some are so influenced by commercials for companies such as Wonga, the biggest lender, that they parrot their slogans and put pressure on parents to take out loans to buy things they want, such as toys and games, MPs heard. Scroll down for video . Puppets: Martin Lewis condemned the use of adverts designed to appeal to children and 'normalise' borrowing . Martin . Lewis, the founder of website Moneysavingexpert.com, called for the ads . to be banned from children’s TV. He said: ‘These lenders are . essentially grooming children to be the next generation of borrowers.’ Peter . Tutton, of debt charity StepChange, said there was ‘explosive’ growth . in the number seeking help with payday loans, on top of other debts. He . said: ‘Is the payday lending industry taking advantage of people who are . struggling? Our evidence suggests that they are. ‘In a sense people are in a hole, and a payday loan is helping them dig that hole deeper.’ Ban: Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert said adverts for payday lenders should not be allowed on children's TV . Labour . is considering backing a cap on interest rates for payday loans, . following Australia, parts of Europe, and some US states. Consumer . groups told MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee . that a voluntary regime set up by lenders to police the way loans are . sold has failed. Mr . Lewis said: ‘The payday loan industry insists it is not targeting . children, but our research shows that kids are being dazzled by catchy . tunes and cute puppets. ‘The current explosion in the number of people borrowing in this way is nothing compared to how the next generation will act.’ A . poll of 3,000 people on his site found 70 per cent of under-16s have . seen TV ads for payday loans. Thirty per cent of parents with children . ten and under said their youngsters repeated payday loan ad slogans. One in seven – 14 per cent – had been pestered by their child to take out a loan to buy them something. Mr . Lewis said: ‘Payday lenders are now so profitable they have huge . advertising and film budgets, which bring in more customers, making even . more profit. This vicious circle means we now see these loans . normalised.  That’s why we need legislation or regulation.’ Gillian Guy, the head of Citizens Advice, said: ‘It reminds me of the old days of cigarette advertising.‘There are no health warnings . . . nothing about the dangers [payday loans] represent.’ Lesley . Titcomb, chief operating officer at the Financial Conduct Authority, . the City watchdog, was asked why she thought such lenders advertise . between children’s shows. Crisis: Labour leader Ed Miliband launched an outspoken attack on payday lenders, who accused of targetting vulnerable people who are threatened and bullied when they get into financial trouble . Stories: In a speech at Battersea Power Station Mr Miliband said he had met people who had fallen foul of threats and bullying by payday lenders . She . said: ‘I imagine there are two reasons – one is that mothers will be . watching with their children, and the other . . . is pressure from the . children on the parents.’ Wonga . said it already has a self-imposed ban on commercials around children’s . TV. However, it does run ads in the daytime, when children are . watching, and in family shows. Bosses . from Wonga and other leading firms also gave evidence to MPs, insisting . the vast majority of their customers are satisfied. They . denied taking advantage  of the vulnerable, failing to make proper . checks on their ability to pay money back, or harassing those who fall . behind on payments. Grilling: Payday lenders including Wonga, Mr Lender and QuickQuid were called to give evidence by the Business, Innovation and Skills committee . Wonga’s . head of public affairs, Henry Raine, told MPs: ‘Wonga’s business is . aiming to lend to people who can pay us back, that’s how we make money. The vast majority of people pay us back on time.’ Mr . Raine said around 3 per cent of people, or some 40,000 of Wonga’s . 1.25million customers, cannot pay their loans back within 60 days. He . said: ‘We do everything we can to lessen the effect of bad debt.’ Yesterday . Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘They are responsible for a quiet . crisis of thousands of families trapped in unpayable debt. ‘The . Wonga economy is one of the worst symbols we have of the cost-of-living . crisis.’ A Wonga spokesman said: ‘While we recognise that there have . been unacceptable practices in the sector, Wonga has been instrumental . in raising standards.’","Money-saving expert calls for adverts to be banned from children's TV .

The New York train that crashed yesterday, killing four, as it whipped round a bend flew off the tracks because of 'human error', it was claimed today. Three of the dead were flung from a carriage as the suburban service ploughed down an embankment towards the Hudson River in the city's Bronx at 7.20am. Sixty three people were injured, 11 of them critically. The driver of the train is believed to have survived the horror as investigations into its cause began. 'It’s definitely human error,' a source told The New York Daily News. 'The speed was excessive.' Passengers on board backed the claim, saying the train was speeding as it approached the curve in the tracks moments before the tragedy unfolded. Fatal: Four passengers died after a Metro North commuter train derailed Sunday morning in the Bronx . Search and rescue: Firefighters scaled the sideways train cars with ladders as they searched for survivors . Horrible tragedy: Several dozen people have been removed from the crash by stretcher - those covered in yellow are deceased . 'The guy was going real fast around the turns and I just didn't know why because we were making good time,' Frank Tatulli told The Sun. Dianne Jackson backed his claim, saying: 'The driver was going around the curve really fast. Next thing you know we we're in the middle of a wreckage.'

William Rockefeller Sr. defended his son to the New York Post, saying 'he’s one of the better engineers, the most dependable. And he really does like trains.' The engineer's uncle, Jan Timothy Rockefeller, sounded a similar note in an interview with the New York Daily News, telling the paper that his nephew has always been very safety-conscious.

The British firm says the technique could allow it to produce complicated components more quickly and cheaply. 3D printers, which are available in high street shops, make solid objects from digital models instead of reproducing text or images on paper. Elaborate: The engineering company has said it could build its famous passenger jet engines, pictured, from parts made by 3D printers . The 3D printers, some which will fit on to a desktop, create three-dimensional objects rather than 2-dimensional images on a page. Rolls-Royce head of technology strategy Dr Henner Wapenhans said: ‘One of the great advantages in the aerospace world is that some of these parts that we make have very long lead times, because of the tooling process. ‘And then it takes potentially 18 months to get the first part after placing an order - versus printing it, which could be done quite rapidly. Even if it takes a week to print, that’s still a lot faster. ‘3D printing opens up new possibilities. Through the 3D printing process, you’re not constrained by having to get a tool in to create a shape. You can create any shape you like. ‘There are studies that show one can create better lightweight structures, because you just take the analogy of what nature does and how bones are built up. And so things that are simple things like brackets can be made a lot lighter.’ Hi-tech to high street: 3D printers are now available in shops for around £1,600 and are moving into mass production . Dr Wapenhans said Rolls-Royce could also make cost savings because it would not need to spend money to store key parts but could ‘print’ them as required. The technology is set to transform many areas of manufacturing. Sales of 3D printers soared last year to £1.5billion and is expected to hit £4billion by 2017, say City experts at analysts Wohlers. Savings: Using printing technology to make parts could save substantial sums currently spent on lengthy construction and storage . Once seen as a hi-tech piece of specialist equipment, 3D printers have begun to move into mass production in recent months. High street electronics store Maplin is selling the first version on the high street for £1,600. The technology dates back to the 1980s when 3D printers used plastics. But the latest versions of the technology is capable of building complex shapes from ceramics and metal. They can be programmed to create a host of items, from sports shoes ton hip-replacement and hit the headlines recently amid claims they were being used to manufacture parts for guns. Scientists are even experimenting with the technology with a view to using cells to create spare body parts and organs. Pupils in UK schools are also to be taught to experiment with the technology under new Government plans to drive up standards in subjects such as maths and science. London’s Science Museum is currently exhibiting 600 3D printed objects. Rolls-Royce plc chief executive John Rishton has vowed to crack down on costs in a bid to keep up with arch-rivals in the aero-engine world such as US giant General Electric which also plans to use 3D printers, including to form fuel nozzles for jet engines. German electronics giant Siemens and car-maker and aero-engine manufactuerer BMW are also developing 3D printing applications. Suzy Antoniw, exhibition leader at London’s Science Museum said: ‘3D printing enables engineers and designers to manufacture things they couldn’t make with traditional methods. ‘Every day we learn about new ways in which people from across society are capitalising on the technology to realise their ideas and enrich people’s lives.’","The new technique could allow quicker and cheaper production .

"By . David Gardner . CREATED: . 14:47 EST, 29 May 2012 . The virus, called 'Flame' is  the third major cyber weapon uncovered after the Stuxnet virus that attacked Iran's nuclear program in 2010, and its data-stealing cousin Duqu, named after the Star Wars villain . The United Nations is set to issue an urgent warning to guard against the most powerful computer virus ever unleashed amid fears it could be used to bring countries to a standstill. In what was being seen last night as the dawn of a new era in cyber warfare, UN computer security chief Marco Obiso said: 'This is the most serious warning we have ever put out.' He was speaking after it was revealed that a massive superbug had been used to hack into computers in Iran. Israel did little to dispute claims yesterday that it was behind the clandestine online assault. The sophisticated spyware – said to be about 100 times the size of most malicious software – also hacked other machines in the Middle East, including Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Egypt, but Iran appeared to be the primary target, according to a Russian Internet security firm. Mr. Obiso, cyber security coordinator for the UN's International Telecommunications Union, said the warning will underline the danger the virus represents to the critical infrastructure of member nations. Dubbed 'Flame', the Trojan bug worms its way into computer systems and reportedly turns infected machines into listening devices. It can activate a computer's audio system to eavesdrop on Skype calls or office chatter, take screenshots or log keystrokes and even suck information from Bluetooth-enabled phones left nearby. 'The complexity and functionality of the newly discovered malicious programme exceed those of all other cyber menaces known to date. 'It pretty much redefines the notion of cyber war and cyber espionage,' said Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab ZAO. The company's conclusion that the superbug was crafted at the behest of a national government fuelled claims that Flame was part of an Israeli-backed campaign of electronic sabotage aimed at archrival Iran. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, center, visits the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Facility some 200 miles (322 kilometers) south of the capital, Tehran, Iran . And the Israelis didn't try and deflect blame. 'Whoever sees the Iranian threat as a significant threat is likely to take various threats, including these, to hobble it,' said Israel's Vice Premier Moshe Yaalon when he was asked about the virus. 'Israel is blessed with high technology and we boast tools that open all sorts of opportunities for us,' he added. Alan Woodward, a professor of computing at the University of Surrey, compared the virus to a smartphone. Depending on what espionage you want to carry out, 'you just add apps.' He said Flame's ability to attack Bluetooth-enabled devices left near a computer attack was 'very unusual.' Bluetooth is a short-range wireless communications protocol generally used for wireless headsets, in-car audio systems or file swapping between mobile phones. The . virus contains about 20 times as much code as Stuxnet, which attacked . an Iranian uranium enrichment facility, causing centrifuges to fail. It has about 100 times as much code as a typical virus designed to steal financial information, Kaspersky Labs said. Flame . can gather data files, remotely change settings on computers, turn on . PC microphones to record conversations, take screen shots and log . instant messaging chats. He . said there was evidence to suggest the code was commissioned by the . same nation or nations that were behind Stuxnet and Duqu, which were . built on a common platform. Professor Woodward said that Flame turns an infected computer into a kind of 'industrial vacuum cleaner,' copying data from vulnerable cell phones or other devices left near it. 'I don't believe I've seen it before,' he added. Udi Mokady, the head of Cyber-Ark, an Israeli developer of information security, claimed only four countries – the US, Israel, Russia and China - had the technological know-how to develop so sophisticated an electronic offensive. 'It's a live programme that communicates back to its master. It asks, where should I go? What should I do now? It's really almost like a science fiction movie,' he said. The Russians discovered the virus after being asked by the United Nations to find a piece of mystery malware that was wiping out sensitive information across the Middle East. It is believed to have been coded by the same programmers who hacked into Iran's nuclear programme six years ago. Last night, Iran's National Computer Emergency Response Team posted a security alert saying it believed Flame was responsible for 'recent incidents of mass data loss.' It also claimed an antidote had been found. The discovery of the Flame virus came just days after talks between Iran and six world powers in Baghdad failed to persuade Tehran to freeze uranium enrichment. A new round of talks is expected to take place in Moscow next month.","'Flame' bug has been used to hack into Iran computers .

While the tragic death of a president was about to kickstart Rather’s impressive career, the then 32-year-old managed to find Abraham Zapruder and his film but couldn’t quite get his hands on it for CBS. ‘This is not a time when everyone has a camera,’ Rather told Tom Brokaw in an interview for NBC News. ‘Not everyone has a motion picture camera.’ As the first journalist to report John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Rather is in a unique position to recount the terrible tale now, at the event’s 50 year anniversary. Scroll down for video... A tragic start to a famous career: Dan Rather was a 32-year-old bureau chief for CBS in Dallas when JFK was shot and recently recounted his struggle to find and then bid for a local man's unique footage of the terrible event . And he did so in Monday night’s . television special My Days in Dallas: A Remembrance With Dan Rather, an . exploration of the shooting on Nov. 22, 1963. He recalls thinking, ‘The president is dead in front of thousands of people. There must be pictures.’ The race was on to become the first news organization to get footage of the president’s death. ‘We started making phone calls,’ Rather said, and within hours the CBS Dallas staff learned of a private citizen who had a camera. ‘Keep in mind, not many people had movie cameras.’ Miraculously, Rather says his team was able to track down Abraham Zapruder, a local businessman who took with him to the presidential motorcade his 8mm Bell & Howell Zoomatic camera. See more videos from the life and death of JFK on YouTube. Breaking it to the nation: Rather shot to national prominence not long after becoming the first to report to the nation the startling details of JFK's assassination in 1963 . Iconic: Dallas sportswear manufacturer Abraham Zapruder (right) took the 1963 the motion picture footage that has now become synonymous with the president's assassination . Near miss: Zapruder nearly left his 8mm Zoomatic that day, but his secretary insisted he take it despite the overcast skies. He later sold the footage he took for $150,000 to Life magazine . ‘By the next morning, Mr. Zapruder, quite wisely, had a lawyer,’ Rather said. Here, Rather leaves out a juicy part of the tale in his discussion with Brokaw that his national producer Don Hewitt does not gloss over in his own recounting. Reports Newsday: . ‘In my desire to get a hold of what was probably the most dramatic piece of news footage ever shot,’ Hewitt said, ‘I told Rather to go to Zapruder’s house, sock him in the jaw, take his film to our affiliate in Dallas, copy it onto videotape, and let the CBS lawyers decide whether it could be sold or whether it was in the public domain.’ In Hewett’s telling, Rather agreed that, yes, punching Zapruder and stealing the tape was the best idea. But the producer quickly had a change of heart. ‘I hadn’t hung up the phone maybe ten seconds when it hit me: What in the hell did you just do? Are you out of your mind? So I called Rather back. Luckily, he was still there.’ Instead of getting physical, Rather showed up to Zapruder’s attorney’s office to broker a deal to get the film. But he wasn’t the only newsman on the case. Still, to this day: Much of what the world saw in the media from that November day in Dealey Plaza was in still photos like this. That's partially because Dan Rather and CBS were outbid for the motion footage by a print magazine, Life . Vantage: This recreation of the assassination  from 1997 shows a similar vantage point to the one Zapruder got in 1963. He was unique for the close vantage and also for having a motion camera in an era when they were relatively rare . Watch Dan Rather report to the world what he saw in Zapruder's footage... ‘I thought that we had the only access to Mr. Zapruder,’ Rather said. However, ‘Richard “Dick” Stolley—a great reporter—at Life magazine at that time…a tough reporter working for an outfit with deep pockets. I hated to see him there.’ Rather was told he could watch the footage once before making his bid for the film. ‘I’ll never forget being in that room. My head was back, my eyes were wide, my mouth was agape.’ - Dan Rather, on the moment he first watched the Zapruder footage . ‘I’ll never forget being in that room,’ he said. ‘My head was back, my eyes were wide, my mouth was agape.’ Rather was given the okay by his higher ups to pay at most $50,000 for the soon-to-be famous film. But when he went to make his first offer, Zapruder’s attorney said the film had been sold. Stolley and Life had paid $150,000—what would be a million dollars today—for the film and stolen it right out from under Rather’s nose. Nonetheless, Rather would go down in history as the first to report JFK’s death and his black and white likeness has become synonymous with the terrible moment in America. Moments to live: Many still photos were taken and the first thing Rather and his CBS team looked for were shots of the moment JFK was killed. When he learned of motion footage and was then able to track it down, he jumped at the chance to buy it . Burned into his memory: 'I¿ll never forget being in that room. My head was back, my eyes were wide, my mouth was agape.'","In the days before phone cameras, sportswear manufacturer Abraham Zapruder happened to be recording the president's 1963 Dallas motorcade with his new 8mm camera .

Sufyan Shahzad, from Pakistan, claimed to have had a whirlwind romance with Hungarian woman Katalin Ottlyk. But when officials noticed that the couple could not communicate properly, they became suspicious and alerted police to the fraud. Sufyan Shahzad (left), from Pakistan, claimed to have had a whirlwind romance with Hungarian woman Katalin Ottlyk (right) Officers waited until the day of the . ceremony on July 27, before swooping to arrest the bride and groom, as . well as a woman alleged to have arranged the sham marriage. It . emerged that Shahzad, 25, had paid 30-year-old Ottlyk £1,500 in order . to stay in the country after his student visa expired a year ago when he . was living in Manchester. The pair both pleaded guilty to the fraud at Bolton Crown Court on Friday. The . court heard that the Blackburn registrar reported the couple to police . after noticing that they 'did not interact with each other or speak the . same language'. When .

Trial: Two people were jailed at Bolton Crown Court, pictured, after admitting their marriage was a sham . Ottlyk later admitted that the marriage was a sham and that she had been paid to take part. Her barrister, Kimberley Morton, said: 'She was very frank in her interview and accepts her guilt. She originally felt sorry for Mr Shahzad but she also received financial reward - but this was a one-off incident and not a sophisticated one.' When the couple appeared in court, their English was so poor that both of them required proceedings to be translated into their native language. Judge Timothy Stead sentenced the pair to 20 months in prison each, with an additional four months for Ottlyk for using an fake ID card which had been stolen from another Hungarian woman. He said: 'You had no intention of being married to each other, it was done entirely so that you, Mr Shahzad could gain a permanent extension of your right to remain in the UK. 'Katalin Ottlyk acted in the course of this conspiracy for money - it is as simple as that. 'Bogus marriages are an abuse of the institution of marriage and an abuse of UK immigration law.'

Developing countries have called for . legally-binding rules that force rich countries to provide money when . they are affected by extreme weather events such as Typhoon Haiyan. Currently, wealthy nations such as Britain offer donations following a natural disaster. But last night a group of nations came together to argue extreme events, such as droughts or . typhoons, are . becoming more frequent because of man-made global warming. Uproar: The summit in Warsaw was rocked by proposals for rich nations to pay 'compensation' for natural disasters . Brazil's representative called for countries which industrialised earlier - such as Britain - to bear the brunt of the financial burden because they have had higher greenhouse gas emissions for longer. The issue has threatened to derail a . fragile consensus at the two-week UN summit in Warsaw, which was meant to end last . night, with talks instead expected to continue well into this morning. In a heated debate last night, the 191 nations addressed the idea of some members paying ‘compensation’ to poor countries for natural disasters. A group of 130 nations led by China even called for scientists to examine historical emissions dating back to the time of the industrial revolution in 1850. The principle has dominated the negotiations at Warsaw, with Britain and other developed nations refusing to countenance the idea of an automatic compensation fund, concerned over the repercussions over legal liability. Debate: The summit's president Marcin Korolec chaired the debate suggesting nations that industrialised earlier should have to donate more money to countries afflicted by natural disasters . Bangladeshi envoy Quamrul Chowdhury said the agreement was vital. ‘We won’t leave Warsaw without it,’ he said. ‘We can’t afford to.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey last night insisted no compensation would be agreed. ‘We aren’t discussing compensation - that is a red line for us,’ he said. But the Liberal Democrat hinted that a compromise might be met with funding instead put into ‘adaptation’ projects such as flood defences and drought resistant crops. Connie Hedegaard, EU commissioner for climate action, said: ‘We cannot have a system where there will be automatic compensation whenever severe weather events happen in one place or another around the planet. You can understand why that is not feasible.’ Tense: French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius was tense as rich countries were told to donate more . The World Bank estimates that economic losses caused by extreme weather currently stand at £120billion a year. Negotiators were becoming increasingly frustrated by the issue, which they said was a ‘distraction’ from the main aim of the talks – to agree rules to bring down international emissions. They accused green campaign groups of whipping up anger among the world’s poorest countries on the issue and blamed them for risking derailment on the main issues. A source close to the talks said: ‘This is an enormous distraction from the important issue of agreeing how emissions should be reduced and how we can help poor countries adapt. ‘The loss and damage agenda is being driven by a small number of countries and NGOs who want the Americans in particular to pay compensation for their past emissions. It is a symptom of an anti-American feeling in many parts of the world.’ More than 800 green campaigners staged a mass walk-out at the talks on Thursday in protest at lack of progress over the issue. The bickering underscores the scale of the difficulty that negotiators face in forging a treaty by 2015 that could replace the Kyoto Protocol, the only international pact limiting fossil fuel emissions. Mr Davey last night tried to shine a positive light on progress at the summit, arguing that the real aim was to sign an international agreement by 2015. He said: ‘We didn’t come to Warsaw expecting to sign a treaty, we expected to make modest progress, the nights and bolts on the way to Paris and I think that is what we will achieve.’ Dismay: Delegates at the closing session which looked set to derail the consensus built up over two weeks . But others gave a bleaker analysis. China’s . lead negotiator Su Wei said the conference was ‘on the verge of . delivering virtually nothing’. He added: ‘This week saw a finance . ministerial with almost no actual finance, and loss and damage talks . that have stalled because developed countries refused to engage.’ The Polish hosts of the UN talks have been criticised for poor management and contributing towards the chaos of the negotiations. The man chairing the summit, Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec, was sacked in a government reshuffle midway through the talks. The country, which gets 90 per cent of its electricity from burning coal, has been one of the most reluctant EU members to reduce carbon emissions.","Group of poorer nations claim richer nations have contributed to global warming so should pay compensation to afflicted countries .

Some of Britain’s leading charities have been accused of handing their chief executives excessive pay rises. Thirty executives at the country’s 14 leading international development charities now earn more than £100,000, it emerged last night. The Charity Commission, the sector’s watchdog has accused the of ‘bringing the charitable world into disrepute’. Conservative MP Priti Patel, pictured, says taxpayers deserve to know how their money is spent. They'll be 'shocked to see so many highly paid executives in charities that are dependent on public funds' Despite falling donations, 11 bosses at the 14 charities which make up the Disasters Emergency Committee are now paid more than the Prime Minister’s £142,500. The figures display a marked increase in salaries at the organisations, which employed just 19 people on six-figure salaries in 2010. The charities employ nearly 200 staff who are paid more than £60,000 - an increase of 16 per cent between 2010 and 2012. William Shawcross, chairman of the Charity Commission, warned charities to control boardroom pay or risk doing harm to their reputations. He said: ‘It is not for the Commission to tell charities how much they should pay their executives. That is a matter for their trustees. ‘However in these difficult times, when many charities are experiencing shortfalls, trustees should consider whether very high salaries are really appropriate, and fair to both the donors and the taxpayers who fund charities. ‘Disproportionate salaries risk bringing organisations and the wider charitable world into disrepute.’ The Disasters Emergency Committee was set up 50 years ago to coordinate work at times of tragedy around the world. The charities involved with DEC include Action Aid, Age International, British Red Cross, CAFOD, Care International, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Islamic Relief, Merlin, Oxfam, Plan UK, Save the Children, Tearfund and World Vision. William Shawcross, chairman of the Charity Commission, pictured, has warned charities to control boardroom pay or risk doing harm to their reputations. 'It is not for the Commission to tell charities how much they should pay their executives', he says. The 14 charities have received more than £1.1billion of public money over the past three years - the bulk of it from the Government, the European Union and the United Nations. Conservative MP Priti Patel said: ‘Hard-pressed taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent and will be shocked to see so many highly paid executives in charities that are dependent on public funds. ‘This money should be focused on delivering frontline services rather than lining the pockets of unaccountable charity executives. ‘As more public money is being given to charities to run services, they need to become more accountable to the public and subject to greater scrutiny and transparency.’ The Disasters Emergency Committee said it has run 62 appeals and raised more than £1.1billion since launching in 1963 - and insisted pay at the organisations was ‘broadly in line’ with other charities. A DEC spokesman said: ‘The Disasters Emergency Committee plays no part in setting executive salaries at our member agencies but we believe these salaries are broadly in line with pay at other charities of comparable size. ‘To ensure the most effective use of appeal funds, a balance must be struck between minimising overheads and ensuring a robust management system is in place. ‘Good management of emergency responses in the UK allows our member agencies to deliver the planning, monitoring, accountability and transparency that this work requires and that the public rightly demands. ‘The proportion of DEC appeal funds that can be spent by member agencies on the UK management of their disaster responses is capped at seven per cent. ‘Over the past five years the DEC has raised over £193million for its appeals and the cost of raising those funds was less than four per cent of that total.’","14 charities receive more than £1.1bn of public money over three years .

The BBC today boasted of its long roster of women sports presenters, headed by Gary Lineker. The blunder of including a man at the top of a list of female stars came as Corporation bosses insisted pundits were appointed on merit, and not their looks. MPs accused TV executives of only allowing ‘very young, attractive’ women on screen, while male presenters tend to be middle-aged, fat and bald. Star: Match of the Day host Gary Lineker was named in a list of the BBC's top female presenters . Senior figures from the BBC, Sky Sports News, BT Sport and Channel 4 were giving evidence on women’s sport to the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. They faced accusations of ‘nauseating political correctness’ for claiming they used female presenters to increase the number of women and girls watching. BBC director of sport Barbara Slater hit back insisting that female presenters were hired on merit, authority and credibility with a long track record of excellence in sports broadcasting. But she committed a gaffe when she named father-of-four Lineker as one of the BBC’s ‘fantastic’ female pundits. She told MPs: ‘We have some fantastic women presenters who have long-standing careers, genuine expertise and are there absolutely to enhance the credibility of what we do. ‘We have Gary Lineker, we have Sue Barker, we have Gabby Logan, we have Clare Balding, we have Suzi Perry now doing Formula One, we have a new sports correspondent Natalie Pirks. They are there on merit.’ Spoof: Internet wags linked to this picture of Lineker dressed as Britney Spears in a Walkers advert as proof he is in touch with his feminine side . Surprise: Lineker responded with 'yikes' after discovering he had been described as a 'fantastic women presenter' The slip-up at a hearing designed to promote the role of women in sport was quickly ridiculed online. Lineker himself tweeted ‘yikes’ while new BBC Formula 1 presenter Suzi Perry joked: ‘Well you haven’t seen Gary on a Friday night.’ Logan, a former international gymnast who presents a variety of shows, added: 'He's very in touch with his female side - it's what makes him so universally loved.' Other presenters hit back at the idea that broadcasters only use young women to lure in more viewers. Labour MP Jim Sheridan said those appearing on screen were young and attractive ‘with one or two exceptions’. Jokes: Sports host Gabby Logan (left) said Lineker was in touch with his feminine side while BBC F1 presenter Suzi Perry joked that people should see him 'on a Friday night' Reaction: F1 presenter Suiz Perry was among Lineker's colleagues to post jokes online about the gender gaffe . Grilling the TV chiefs he said: ‘We very seldom see Clare Balding in the back pages but suddenly she's on the front pages today because she's lost some weight. ‘There's a feeling out there that if you're over 30 in the sports pundit game then you're finished.’ He went on: ‘Is it coincidental that the vast majority of women presenters, pundits etc are all very young, attractive people, with one or two exceptions? ‘If you look at their male counterparts they are all mature, fat, bald like the rest of us.’ Clare Balding presents sport on the BBC, Channel 4 and BT Sport . But Logan, who has presented football, athletics and swimming for the BBC, wrote on Twitter: ‘We are all over 40 on BBC Sport.’ Head of BT Sport Simon Green said having female presenters and pundits ‘makes for a richer viewing experience’ and ‘often does make a difference in terms of how an audience will react’. Andy Cairns, executive editor of Sky Sports News, said: ‘Women make up 30 per cent of our audience and they go to football matches, they go to cricket matches, they play sport. ‘It's quite right that they are reflected in our presenter line-up. Our presenters are all experienced, qualified journalists and they are there on merit.’ But Tory MP Philip Davies said there was no proof that using female presenters helped to boost the number of women watching and taking part in sport. He said: ‘It's a masterclass in politically-correct, tokenistic, tick-boxing competition. To be perfectly honest, it's rather nauseating. ‘You have got absolutely no idea whether it makes any difference to whether more women watch the programme, you've got no idea whether it increases the audience for sport more generally. ‘You are simply doing it for one reason only: to be able to come here and say we've managed to tick this box.’","BBC director of sport Barbara Slater makes blunder in Parliament .

They introduced a fingerprint sensor for unlocking the iPhone 5s and now Apple has been granted the rights for an even more advanced means of security - the face. The tech giant was yesterday awarded U.S. Patent No. 8,600,120, which is a 'personal computing device control using face detection and recognition'. In addition to using face recognition for unlocking an iPhone, it could also be used for unlocking specific features on the phone,  according to AppleInsider. For instance, an incoming call or text could only be unlocked by the person who is registered with the facial recognition security. Interfacing: The future of Apple products looks to involve facial recognition in the security process of devices, such as unlocking phones, after the tech giant acquired a new patent on Tuesday . Apple on Tuesday was granted a patent - seen here - that uses facial recognition technology to control a computing device, like an iPhone, iPad or Mac, allowing for a more secure and productive operating environment . The patent's documents note that face detection and recognition are two different processes. Detection involves locating faces within an image, while recognition goes deeper by pairing those faces with a particular person or user . It joins another patent Apple landed two years ago for facial recognition technology, around the time some Android phones began letting users unlock their devices with their faces. Samsung Galaxy devices already use facial recognition to unlock the phones. While experts say the move is likely part of a plan for the iPhone 6, just like many other patents the company have acquired, the technology may never acutally be put into play. Venture Beat reports the patent consists of three systems: A face detection application, which lets it distinguish faces from their surroundings; a face recognition application, which identifies individual faces; and an input/output application, which will let Appleâ€™s devices act on all the facial data. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 also utilize face recognition for easy logins. Computers are expected to be the next device to actively use facial recognition. If facial recognition systems were to be rolled out, all a device would need to operate it is a computer that faces the user . When it comes to computers, the patent says that so long as an image of the person using the device can be seen over a period of time, it could unlock features within the computer exclusive to that user . The technology just requires a camera facing the user, making it easy to implement. Apple also recently completed its acquisition of 3D body sensing firm PrimeSense, an Israeli firm that helped create the original Microsoft Kinect's motion sensing capabilities . It has been rumored that Apple is working on a 4.8-inch edge-to-edge display with sapphire glass. It has also been rumored that the next-generation iPhone will have 3D vision. The next iPhone is expected to be released in spring 2014.","On Tuesday apple were granted the rights to a 'personal computing device control using face detection and recognition'

A 'polo-playing friend of Prince Charles' could be jailed for failing to hand over Mercedes cars, a Harley Davidson motorbike and a personalised number plate to his ex-wife. Libor Krejci, 63, a former tennis coach turned property developer, led an 'international lifestyle', including yachting and playing polo with royalty, off the back of an off-shore family trust worth at least £30m, according to his ex-wife, Gillian Hope Lewis. But he claimed he was broke, having declared himself bankrupt in the UK when he and his wife split in 2000. Battle: Libor Krejci (left), was described as a 'polo playing friend of Prince Charles' worth £30m, is facing a bid to have him jailed by his ex-wife Gillian Hope Lewis (right), for not handing over Mercedes CL500 and SL350 cars and a Harley Davidson as well as a personalised number plate as part of his divorce settlement . However, his plea of poverty was rejected by divorce judge, Mr Justice Mostyn, who ordered him to pay his ex £368,000 including costs. In June last year, the judge also ruled that Mrs Hope Lewis could enforce her order against two riverside flats in Battersea - valued by lawyers at £1m - along with two Mercedes cars and a Harley Davidson, as they represented the only accessible assets linked to her husband in the UK. The properties and the vehicles were the property of Mr Krejci’s off-shore family trust, but the judge allowed the wife to 'pierce the corporate veil' and take possession in order to satisfy the divorce award. Now Mrs Hope Lewis has applied to the High Court to have Mr Krejci committed to prison, for his alleged failure to deliver up the Mercedes CL500 and SL350 cars and the motorbike, along with personalised number plate LBO1. Mr Krejci has already had an appeal against the lump sum order thrown out by Lord Justice Thorpe, in the Court of Appeal - where he was described by the judge as 'generally angry about everything.' The businessman, of Lombard Road, Battersea, and Mrs Hope Lewis, separated in 2000, after a 17-year marriage, leaving her as the primary carer for their teenage daughter. In 2011, Mr Justice Mostyn called Mr Krejci’s conduct of the case 'truly abysmal'. He also found that 'bankruptcy in the UK didn’t involve much hardship for the husband.' 'His business was successful and was owned by the (off-shore) trust,' said the judge, who added: 'He had access to large amounts of cash from his inheritance in the Czech Republic.' 'Friend of Prince Charles': Mrs Hope Lewis' then barrister, Duncan Brooks, told the Appeal Court last year 'he is the polo-playing friend of Prince Charles and the beneficiary of an off-shore trust with assets exceeding £30m' He put Mr Krejci’s identifiable assets at £1m, although his wife claims he has access to far more. Mrs Hope Lewis, formerly of Bole Walk, Cardiff, but currently believed to be living in Battersea, is now asking the High Court Family Division to commit her ex-husband to prison for alleged contempt of court in failing to hand over the cars and motorbike awarded to her by the judge. In a preliminary hearing, her barrister, Amy Kisser, told the court that '19 attempts' had so far been made to serve court documents on Mr Krejci, without success, and asked Mrs Justice Parker to deem that he had been officially informed of the proceedings via email last month. Timothy Becker, for Mr Krejci, did not object, and the judge ruled that good service had been achieved and ordered Mr Krejci to pay legal costs. However Mr Becker went on to tell the court that Mr Krejci argues it is not his responsibility to hand over the vehicles and number plate. The most valuable of the cars is in the Czech Republic and, according to the husband, belonged to a former tennis player whom he used to coach, the barrister said. '(Ownership) has been transferred to the wife, so in our submission, it is up to her to retrieve it,' he told the judge. Miss Kisser said that the tennis player - David Rikl, a former Wimbledon doubles finalist - had told Mrs Hope Lewis, ""we’ve got the car - come and get it in the Czech Republic if you want to try your hand,"" - that is his position.' International lifestyle: Libor Krejci, 63, a former tennis coach turned property developer, led an 'international lifestyle', including yachting and playing polo with royalty, off the back of an off-shore family trust worth at least £30m, according to his ex-wife, Gillian Hope Lewis. Pictured is Prince Harry taking part in a charity polo match . Arguing that it is Mr Krejci’s responsibility to track down and deliver up the vehicles to his ex, the barrister added: 'It is for him and his company to take proceedings in the Czech Republic.' Mrs Hope Lewis’ then barrister, Duncan Brooks, told the Appeal Court last year that Mr Krejci 'is a man of contradiction.' 'To the court, in these proceedings, he is penniless and staving off the insolvency of the company that has been his life’s work. 'To the public at large he is the polo-playing friend of Prince Charles and the beneficiary of an off-shore trust with assets exceeding £30m, including properties in Monaco, Geneva, New York and Prague.' The barrister also claimed that 'post-separation, the husband had continued to live life as before, funded via the trust.' He added: 'By contrast, the wife...was not funded by the trust and was left penniless...Mr Krejci continued to lead an international lifestyle, developing properties and spending much of his time sailing. All of this was conducted behind the veil of the trust.' The full committal hearing, which could see Mr Krejci put behind bars if he does not hand over the vehicles and the number plate, is now set to come back before the High Court in the New Year. Mr Krejci also has another challenge pending in the Court of Appeal, which will be heard first. Outside court, the husband’s barrister estimated the value of the two properties at about £1m, though the equity in them is believed to be less than £100,000. The value of the vehicles and number plate is a matter of dispute between the former spouses.","Libor Krejci, 63, a former tennis coach led an 'international lifestyle'

Jordan Silverstone has been criticised for selling a tuxedo David Beckham donated to a charity shop for £2,600 . Posing in the tuxedo he bought from a charity shop for just £125 after it was donated by David Beckham, this is the economics student who has been criticised for cashing in after he sold the item online for £2,600. Jordan Silverstone bought the Savile Row tuxedo from a British Red Cross charity shop in Chelsea after the Beckhams donated more than 20 boxes of clothes, bags and shoes in an attempt to raise money for victims of Typhoon Haiyan. Hundreds of fans queued around the block in a bid to get their hands on rare designer items, but a number of shoppers then put the items up for sale online. Mr Silverstone had queued for one and a half hours before buying the suit which Beckham wore to the Sun’s Military Awards in 2011, where he was pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge. The 22-year-old has said he originally bought the William Hunt tuxedo for his father Matthew's 53rd birthday, but when he got it home he realised his father would not fit into it. The Nottingham University student then decided to sell the suit and keep three quarters of the profit, to pay for a day out with his father and to put towards paying off his student loan, with the rest going to charity. But the Nottingham University student has suffered abuse through social media sites and on eBay accusing him of cashing in on a charitable gesture. Nazaneen Ghaffer, a Sky News weather presenter, said on Twitter that if an item doesn’t fit, people should ‘just sell them for what he/she paid’ – not make a profit. But Mr Silverstone responded, saying: ‘It is absolute nonsense. If I keep the suit and leave it in my Dad’s wardrobe never to be worn then that is okay, but if I sell it on to a buyer who really wants it that isn’t?' He added: ‘Where is the logic behind that? It’s rich of anyone to knock someone else’s charitable donations. Nazaneen Ghaffer poses pictures of her exotic holidays in Dubai on Twitter – is someone having a go at her for not giving this money to starving children? No.’ He said: ‘From an economics point of view, it makes complete sense. ‘It doesn’t fit my dad, so we want to sell it to someone who can get value out of it as that’s better than it being unused. Mr Silverstone queued for one and a half hours before he bought the suit from the British Red Cross charity shop in Chelsea . ‘This way I can raise more money for . charity than I already have by buying the tux and make a profit to do . something nice with my dad.’ Only 150 shoppers were allowed in to the charity shop on November 22, before it changed to one-in-one out, after more than 500 donated items went on sale, incuding designs by Dolce & Gabbana, Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo, which started at just £25. But Mr Silverstone is not the only one who has put up one of the items for sale to make a profit. Other items that have been auctioned online include Victoria's white platform trainers she wore at the Dodgers Mets game on June 7, 2007, with bids starting at £1,000 despite the owner paying less than £50 for them.

The man who created the 3D plastic gun is revelling in a title that has seen him voted the 14th most dangerous person in the world. Cody Wilson, a former law student at the University of Texas in Austin, says he is proud that people consider him to be 'dangerous'.'I consider that one of the finest achievements in my young career. Probably never to be topped again.' Mr Wilson is well aware of the controversy his invention has created, but disputes the fact that he is dangerous to anyone. 'Dangerous to who? Dangerous to what? How often can one individual p*** off the entire world? The entire world of financial and government superstructures?' he asks with a smirk. 'I hope to make it back up the lst, but I'll settle for 14. It was a good run.' Scroll down for video... Cody Wilson: The law student says he is proud that people consider him to be 'dangerous' Dangerous: Cody Wilson, of Defense Distributed, with the first completely 3D-printed handgun, The Liberator . Bang: This is the moment Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson successfully fired the first working plastic gun made by a 3-D printer . Blueprints for the first-ever plastic . gun produced on a 3-D printer, that can pass through metal detectors, . were first posted to the web in May. Designs for the 'Liberator' pistol were posted online by Defense Distributed but . the U.S. State Department ordered the website to take down . the blueprints, on the basis that the plans could violate export . regulations. The . blueprints, that could be produced on 3-D printers costing as little . as $1,000, were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously . designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing . modern ammunition. Mr Wilson made the schematics for the . weapon available for free  - meaning everyone with a high-end 3-D . printer can create their own version of the gun. Practicing his aim: There are ways that this can potentially create a huge problem for the American public . Crude: The Liberator plastic gun is a simple single-shot weapon that fires a small .380-caliber bullet . Homemade: Cody Wilson's Liberator¿s designs were downloaded more than 100,000 times in just two days before federal officials demanded their removal in May . Plastic: Sixteen of the 17 parts that make up the Liberator are plastic, constructed by a 3-D printer. A small nail is used for a firing pin . Sixteen of the 17 parts in the . Liberator pistol are made from tempered plastic molded inside the . Stratasys Dimension SST 3D printer. The final piece of the weapons - the . firing pin - is a common nail. Mr Wilson told Forbes.com . that he hopes to make weapons available to anyone who wants them. It is . a bid, he says, to keep governments accountable to the people. 'You . can print a lethal device. It’s kind of scary, but that’s what we’re . aiming to show,' he said. 'Anywhere there’s a computer and an Internet . connection, there would be the promise of a gun.' The name of the gun - Liberator - comes from a simple World War II pistol that was designed by the U.S. military to made cheaply and air dropped in large numbers into occupied Europe and concentration camps. Like its World War II predecessor, the Defense Distributed pistol is a crude weapon. It holds only a single shot and uses an inaccurate smooth bore. 3-D printing is poised to revolutionize engineering and reforge industries from medicine, to construction to aerospace. The process, also called additive manufacturing, creates a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model. The feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic. The layers are then joined together to create the final shape. The machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and 'slices' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing. The process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s. However, since 2010, an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3-D printers, which are increasingly small, increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable. Defense Distributed used a higher-end $8,000 model to build its 3-D gun. However entry-level desktop models can cost $500 to $1,000. The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. Engineers hope 3-D printing will begin an era of 'instant prototyping' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively. The group has successfully fired it . with a .380-caliber pistol round. However, an attempt to shoot a . slightly larger 5.7 x 28mm defense cartridge blew the gun to pieces. Currently, the Liberator can only be . made through highly specialized processes on an $8,000 3-D printer. Mr . Wilson says he hopes to adapt the model . The technology behind 3-D printing is not new and has available for industrial applications for decades. It . is only since about 2010, though, that 3-D printers have become cheap . enough, simple enough to use and compact enough for most consumers to . purchase. The guns are made out of plastic, so . they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or . sporting event. The only . metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to . be detected by metal detectors, for instance, when you go through an . airport. Current law bans . all-plastic weaponry. Defense Distributed weapons have just one large metal piece in the handle, to get around the law. Worries: Officials are concerned about individuals slipping plastic guns past metal detectors and into schools, sporting events or government offices. Dangerous? 'I hope to make it back up the lst, but I'll settle for 14. It was a good run', says Cody Wilson . Production: In an instruction video, the 3D printed gun is shown being printed layer by layer using technology that could soon become commonplace in the home . Process: Video shows the team beginning to assemble the gun after each part was printed and cleaned .","Cody Wilson does not believe he is dangerous despite building a weapon that is unable to be seen by metal detectors .

But it seems the programme’s makers think Olivia Colman’s understated charm would be lost on American viewers. The Bafta-winning actress was snubbed for the US remake in favour of an attractive blonde star, she has revealed. While David Tennant, left, will reprise his role as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy in the American version of Broadchurch his co-star Olivia Colman, right, has been replaced by Breaking Bad star Anna Gunn . Scottish actor David Tennant will reprise his role as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy – renamed Emmett Carver in the American version. But Miss Colman’s character, Detective Ellie Miller, will be played by Anna Gunn, 45, who won an Emmy for her part as Skyler White, the wife of a drug dealing chemistry teacher, in American show Breaking Bad. When asked last week why she had been dropped from the cast, Miss Colman, 39, said: ‘I don’t know. I never got the call.’ But she has previously admitted failing to live up to the American ideal of beauty. She said: ‘I don’t fit in there . really. Don’t get me wrong, if Hollywood calls, I’m going, but I can . also see why they haven’t called. Olivia Colman, left, will reprise her role as DS Ellie Miller in the second ITV series of Broadchurch next year. But the makers of the US version, to be named Gracepoint, have opted for Breaking Bad star Anna Gunn, right . Broadcasters are hiring only young, attractive women as on-screen sports presenters while sidelining older anchors, MPs claimed yesterday. The BBC, Sky Sports News, Channel 4 and BT Sport were accused of casting aside anyone over 30 in favour of prettier, more youthful faces. Channel bosses were also told they were guilty of ‘nauseating political correctness’ for claiming they were using female presenters to raise interest in sport among girls and women. Labour MP Jim Sheridan said male presenters tended to be older, fat and bald, while women were young and attractive, ‘with one or two exceptions’. ‘There’s a feeling out there that if you’re over 30 in the sports pundit game then you’re finished,’ he said as TV chiefs were questioned by the Culture, Media and Sports committee. But BBC director of sport Barbara Slater said: ‘We want a diverse mix of presenters, and we want them there on merit.’ ‘I . eat a bit too much, my teeth aren’t perfect, I’ve got eye bags. I look . like a normal 39-year-old woman – but in England no one minds that.’ In contrast Miss Gunn is no stranger to pressures placed on US actors to look glamorous, recently revealing how she accidentally gained weight while filming Breaking Bad. She said: ‘I was actually ill while I was filming and it affected my weight. They gave me cortisone and I puffed up and gained weight. Now I’m better, thank God. I run around after two kids. And I do Pilates.’ The remake – to be called Gracepoint – will start filming in January and screen towards the end of next year on US channel Fox. With Broadchurch writer Chris Chibnall in place as executive producer, the series will follow the same plot, with the same dramatic denouement that gripped 8.3million British viewers in April. Miss Colman will reprise her role when the ITV drama returns to British screens for a second series next year. Earlier this year, Will Mellor, who played psychic phone engineer Steve Connolly, hinted that the next series could be a prequel. He said: ‘I can’t see it being about another murder because it will be a bit too coincidental. ‘It might go back to the old case that David Tennant’s character didn’t finish. Whatever it’ll be, it’ll be fantastic.’","Actress who played DS Ellie Miller revealed US makers of the new show have cast Breaking Bad star Anna Gunn in her place .

These pictures show an amazing country mansion which was transformed by its owners from a pig farm into a £1.5 million home. The farm buildings were included on the land that architect couple Tod Wakefield and Mary Collier bought when they moved into a bungalow near Pulborough, West Sussex, 15 years ago. And, after battling for three years to get planning permission, the pair converted the buildings and made it their home. While it retains its original shape, having been converted rather than completely rebuilt, the family's home of six years now boasts four bedrooms - and 154 windows. This property, converted from a disused pig farm, has gone on the market in West Sussex for £1.5million . It took architects Tod Wakefield and Mary Collier three years to get planning permission after buying the farm . Their home, which they have decided to leave now their two adult children have moved out, has an east wing and a west wing linked by a 34-ft-long dining room. In addition, the environmentally sustainable Manor Home is fitted with super-insulation to all roof and walls along with underfloor heating. The former pig farm, which has an abundance of oak features from trees which were previously on site, also has a 5,000-litre subsurface rainwater harvesting tank. It has been calculated that the south facing glass provides 6.5 kW of heat in the summer while the low winter sun heats up the solid floor. The pair wanted their home to be environmentally sustainable and fitted Manor Farm with super insulation to all roof and walls along with underfloor heating . Manor Home, near Pulborough, West Sussex, is now up for sale for £1.5 million . The ground floor of the east wing has a kitchen/breakfast room, utility room and living room with mezzanine floor. The west has two studies which also double up as the fourth and fifth bedrooms along with a sitting room and bathroom. On . the first floor, there are three bedrooms and two roof terraces which . overlook the property's three acres of grounds and stunning onward . views. Mr Wakefield, an architecture lecturer at the University of Portsmouth, said the couple had spent around £500,000 converting the home - which he estimated had not been used for pigs for 30 years. Although he admitted he and his wife are hoping to 'down-size' in the area as he approaches retirement age, Mr Wakefield, 64, did not rule out taking on another ambitious design. He said: 'The thing is, when you are an architect you can never give up on projects like this.'

It is one of a kind in every way. ‘The windows, which are all bespoke, keep the house warm and also generate heat.' He added: ‘It is an exceptional piece of award-winning architecture which really flows. There is so much natural light. ‘It has suited the owners down to the ground but with their children now grown up they don't need as much space and have decided it is time for a new project.’ The architect couple, who have two adult children, have now decided to move on after living at Manor Home for six years .

Fraudulent: Linda Rose Gagnon, 59, has been convicted of stealing the retirement money of nuns from the U.S. Province of the Religious of Jesus and Mary in 2011 . A 59-year-old woman has been convicted of an unholy scheme in which she scammed Catholic nuns out of $285,000 to spend on personal luxuries. California's Linda Rose Gagnon was convicted on Tuesday for stealing the retirement money of sisters from the U.S. Province of the Religious of Jesus and Mary (RJM) in 2008. Instead of buying the nuns a home with the funds, as promised, she blew it on lingerie, holidays, manicures and valet services for her dog. According to the indictment, Gagnon ran a Tustin . company, Rose Enterprises Inc., which represented itself as helping clients with delinquent mortgages and . other real-estate transactions. Gagnon, who had once attended a boarding school run by the order, allegedly visited the Rhode Island convent. When she learned they were interested in buying a San Diego property for the care of elderly and infirm nuns, Gagnon offered to help with the deal despite not having a California real estate license, according to UPI. 'Armed . with a bogus letter that appeared to be from a California attorney, . Gagnon convinced the nuns to wire $285,000 from their retirement account . to be used in the purchase of the property,' a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles said. Gagnon traveled to one of the order's residences in Rhode Island where she learned about their investment plans. Pictured is the Dina Mission Center, a residence for RJM sisters, in Woonsocket, Rhode Island . The nuns sent the money to Gagnon, who is also known as Linda Gualtieri-Gagnon. But instead of using the money to buy the house, Gagnon blew the money on personal travel, lingerie, manicures, restaurants, lease payments for an Audi TT sports car, her business and valet pet-sitting services for her dog, OC Weekly reported. 'She paid off $42,000 she borrowed. There was $448 at Chadwick's of London, an intimate apparel store in San Francisco. Then she went shopping at Nordstroms, visited the nail salon and of course a pet-sitting service,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Keenan said, according to Los Angeles Times. 'She also leased an Audi TT sports car...She was living nicely on the nuns' money.' Law Fuel reported Gagnon spent the cash in just 64 days and brazenly asked the order for another $285,000.

Jäger bombs (pictured) are a favourite among many party goers but new research suggests they could increase the risk of alcohol poisoning . Jäger bombs are a favourite among many party goers, but new research suggests they could put people at greater risk of alcohol poisoning. U.S. researchers found mixing alcohol with energy drinks is riskier than drinking alcohol alone. They say young adults who mix the two tend to drink more, and become drunker, than those who do not. Dr Megan Patrick, from the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, said: ‘We found that college students tended to drink more heavily and become more intoxicated on days they used both energy drinks and alcohol, compared to days they only used alcohol.’ Dr Patrick, who worked with Professor Jennifer Maggs from Penn State University, says mixing alcohol with energy drinks could increase the risk of alcohol poisoning because it encourages people to drink more. She added it could also have other implications as it makes people more likely to be ‘wide awake drunk’ after a night of partying meaning they are more likely to behave in an antisocial way. The researchers studied 652 students and during four two-week periods they asked them to answer questions about their consumption of energy drinks and alcohol. They also asked them to record any problems they experienced as a result – from suffering a hangover, to getting in trouble with the police. Dr Patrick said: ‘Our findings suggest that the use of energy drinks and alcohol together may lead to heavier drinking and more serious alcohol-related problems. ‘As energy drinks become more and more popular, we should think about prevention strategies for reducing the negative consequences of using energy drinks and of combining energy drinks with alcohol.’ The news comes just after it was revealed that energy drinks that are high in caffeine change the way the heart beats. Researchers at the University of Bonn, in Germany, found the drinks could increase the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythm problems. People who mix alcohol and energy drinks tend to drink more and to get drunker. This means they are more likely to engage in antisocial behaviour . They discovered that healthy adults who consumed the drinks had significantly increased heart contraction rates one hour later. This means that the chamber of the heart that pumps blood around the body - the left ventricle - was contracting harder an hour after the energy drink had been consumed. Dr Jonas Dörner said: 'There are concerns about the products' potential adverse side effects on heart function, especially in adolescents and young adults, but there is little or no regulation of energy drink sales.'","Mixing the two is riskier than drinking alcohol alone, U.S. researchers say .

Lost: A mystery teenager who does not know his name, age or nationality has been discovered after he escaped traffickers (posed by model) A mystery foreign teenager who does not know his name, age or nationality and has never been to school has been found in a city centre, a charity said today. The young man is believed to have fled a house he was trafficked to in London when he was a small child and was discovered at a bus station in Coventry. The mystery youth - believed in be in his late teens - heard someone speaking a language he understood and asked for help, and they put him in touch with staff at the Coventry Refugee and Migrant Centre. All he had in his possession when he arrived in the Midlands was a letter from a solicitor saying he was 'stateless'. He told staff he did not know his name, age, or country of origin. He said he had been trafficked into the country. Paul Wheeler, from the charity, said: 'As far as we can tell he could have fallen out of the sky. 'He doesn't know his own name or his country of origin. We don't know how long he has been in the UK - all we know is that he tells us he got on a bus in London and arrived in Coventry.' He speaks Urdu, Hindi and basic English and says he came to the UK when he was around six years old and has been kept in a house in London. He told the centre's safeguarding unit that he was not allowed outside and he did not go to school. Mr Wheeler said: 'He thinks he came to the UK when he was six because 'the lady in the house' told him that. 'But when we gently asked what had gone on in the house, he became very nervous and as of now has said nothing. 'We have no idea how old he is.' Found: The young man heard a language he recognised in the Pool Meadow Bus Station in Coventry (pictured), and he was then put in contact with a refugee charity . It is understood he has tried to seek asylum in Britain. The young man has not been working illegally in Coventry and was not asked to come to the city - he simply arrived here on November 11. Because he is stateless it means he is unable to register with a number of bodies in the UK. He cannot see a doctor or get help from a number of different agencies.","Charity says only possession he had was a letter saying he was 'stateless'

Millions more Britons could be given statins to cut their risk of heart attacks and strokes after US guidelines recommended a third of adults should take them. The new advice tells doctors to consider a patient’s lifetime risk and may result in a doubling of prescriptions. It will be closely monitored by British experts who are preparing two updated sets of guidelines on statin use. But the number of people taking the drugs in the UK is unlikely to increase by as much as in the States. On the rise: Millions more Britons could be given statins to cut their risk of heart attacks and strokes after US guidelines recommended a third of adults should take them . Dr David Wald, consultant cardiologist at Barts and the London Hospital, said: ‘The new guidelines widen access to statin treatment. ‘This recognises the effectiveness of statins in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes, their safety and the availability of lower-cost generic statins, which makes prevention more affordable. ‘It is a sensible step forward and it would be sensible for Britain to follow by introducing policies that simplify as well as broaden access to statin treatment.’ Eight million Britons take statins, up from five million a decade ago. But experts believe many more should be on them. Heart disease – which includes heart attacks and strokes  – claims 82,000 lives annually. Last year, Oxford researchers claimed 2,000 lives could be saved annually if they were prescribed more widely. Precautionary: Last year, Oxford researchers claimed 2,000 lives could be saved annually if statins were prescribed more widely . At present, GPs and cardiologists decide whether to prescribe statins mainly by looking at a patient’s cholesterol level – the fatty deposits in blood that clog arteries. But the guidance issued in America yesterday urges doctors to consider patients’ overall risk of heart attacks and strokes based on their age, whether they smoke, their weight and their gender. That may lead to more women being offered the drugs because they are more likely to have strokes than men. Statins are recommended for 15 per cent of adults in the US, but if doctors follow the guidelines they would be prescribed to 30 per cent – 22 per cent of women and 44 per cent of men. Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said experts drawing up the guidelines for the NHS would be looking closely at the US recommendations, drawn up by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology. But he said it was too early to say how many more patients here would take statins as a result. He said: ‘I don’t know what effect we will see but my suspicion is it will increase. ‘But I’d be very surprised if it led to a doubling in the numbers of patients.’ Experts from the Joint British Societies of Guidelines are due to publish recommendations for GPs and cardiologists on how they should prescribe statins. In July next year, the NHS rationing watchdog, NICE, will produce further guidance setting out when doctors should use them. Both are expected to tell doctors to consider patients whole-life risk of heart attacks and strokes – as in the US guidelines – rather than simply focusing on cholesterol levels. Last year there were 61million prescriptions in England for statins, which cost as little as £16 for a 12-month course. They work by reducing the cholesterol in the arteries, and are normally given to patients with high cholesterol following a heart attack, stroke or bypass. Around one million prescriptions for statins are written each week, compared with just a few thousand in 1981. Statins make up nearly a fifth of all drugs prescribed for heart and circulatory disease in England. The drugs reduce blood levels of cholesterol, which can build up inside arteries, damaging them and raising the risk of heart disease and stroke. They may also protect against other health problems, including blood clots and eye disorders, by maintaining a healthy blood supply to the brain. The most serious adverse reaction is myopathy in about one in 1,000 patients, which can result in muscle pain and weakness.","New advice tells doctor's they should consider a patient's lifetime risk .

A student 'terrified' holidaymakers as he hurled abuse at passengers and cabin crew and swung from seats while on board a packed flight to Ibiza. Muscular Kyle Bent began shouting at a fellow passenger as the aeroplane came into land on the Spanish party island, before threatening staff on the Thomas Cook flight. The 25-year-old personal trainer has been jailed for 10 weeks after he admitted two public order offences in relation to his behaviour on the plane in July this year. Abuse: Kyle Bent, 25, left passengers 'terrified' as he hurled abuse at holidaymakers and cabin crew on board a flight to Ibiza . Jailed: The student and personal trainer yelled at magistrates 'You have ruined my life' as he was sentenced to 10 weeks in prison . As magistrates doled out his sentence, Bent screamed at them 'you have ruined my life' before he was led away to the cells. Trafford Magistrates' Court heard how passengers on the late-night flight from Manchester felt threatened by Bent's outburst. Lauren Costello, prosecuting, said: 'This case is brought on the basis of the defendant’s disgraceful behaviour to passengers and cabin crew who all felt threatened and worried. In the confines of an aeroplane there was no space to escape from him.' During the safety briefing, Bent, a Manchester Metropolitan University student was described as ‘boisterous and excited’. Boisterous: During the safety briefing Bent was described as 'boisterous and excited', and on take-off struggled to remain still . On take-off, he struggled to keep still and began shouting ‘inane’ comments to his friends. Ross Stafford, a teacher on the flight, had kindly swapped seats with Bent so the defendant could be closer to his friends. However, after feeling a force on the back of his seat and turning round, Bent swore at him. When Mr Stafford told him to calm down he swore again before adding: 'Look at what you’re wearing, you look like a grandad, what have you got on? Watch what you’re saying.' Mr Stafford was so scared he moved seats, only for Bent to then turn on the cabin crew. On board: Bent had been travelling from Manchester airport to Ibiza on the Thomas Cook flight . When flight attendant Lisa Cahill urged him to fasten his seatbelt for landing, he refused, swore at her and began swinging from the seat rests in the aisle. He was again asked  to sit down, only to swear again, adding: 'Your breath stinks, stop talking to me little girl.' Bent was asked for his passport so his details could be recorded but he refused, swore, and threatened the attendant and her family. Bent, from Victoria Park, Manchester, admitted two public order offences of using threatening or abusive behaviour when he appeared before the court. Karl Miles, mitigating, said: 'Mr Bent proffers his apologies for his behaviour. He has remorse and regret for what happened on that flight.' Destination: The late-night flight had been packed with holidaymakers headed for the Spanish island of Ibiza (file picture) Mr Miles said Bent suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Jailing Bent for 10 weeks, Anne Marie Evans, chairman of the bench, told Bent: 'Your behaviour during a flight full of passengers seems to have terrified everybody.' As he was taken down Bent shouted at the bench: ‘You have ruined my life’. After the hearing, Pc Steve Thompson, airport community beat officer who helped catch Bent on his return from Ibiza, said: 'Anti-social behaviours will not be tolerated in any form. 'Greater Manchester Police will go to any lengths to apprehend an offender and bring him to justice. 'Even if they leave the country we will be ready for them when they get back.'","Kyle Bent, 25, shouted at fellow holidaymakers on Ibiza flight .

As the ski season gets underway, thousands of tourists will be packing their bags and heading off to the Swiss Alps to enjoy themselves on the slopes. However, one man has taken a different approach and has instead spent his time six miles above the pistes capturing these stunning photographs. Using a rented aircraft, photographer Basti Hansen took shots of  the magnificent mountains as few people will have seen them before. Basti Hansen used a rented aeroplane in order to capture these pictures from nearly four miles above the Alps highest peak, that of Monte Rosa . Hansen took the pictures from near Locarno, a small town of roughly 15,000 people on the northern tip of Lake Maggiore . Taking off from Locarno, a small town of 15,000 people on the northern tip of Lake Maggiore, he flew to 36,000ft before taking out his camera. At that height he would have passed four miles over the Swiss Alps' highest peak, that of Monte Rosa, which stands at just under three miles high. In one photograph he captures the mountain range, which covers around 65 per cent of Switzerland, bathed in golden sunlight. Cruising along at 36,000ft Hansen would have been able to easily pass over the highest mountain in Switzerland, Dom, which has a summit of just under 15,000ft . Down below the plane the Alps, which proved an impassable barrier to men and armies throughout history, look like miniature models . In several other pictures the snowy mountain tops can be seen poking through clouds which seem to flow through the steep valleys below. In one amazing shot the curvature of the Earth can even be seen above the peaks, with the sombre darkness of space across the top of the picture. While the ski season can start as early as November and last until May, most Swiss resorts open during December with skiing running through until April. Here the peaks of some of Switzerland's mountains can be seen jutting through the clouds which seem to fill the valleys in between them . Every year thousands of tourists take to the Swiss slopes on skiing holidays with the industry making up 3 per cent of Switzerland's total economy . Tourism accounts for around 3 per cent of Switzerland's total economy with some of the most popular destinations being Davos, Verbier and Valais. The highest mountain to lie entirely within Swiss borders is the Dom, which rises nearly 15,000ft and is the third highest in the Alps. The town of Locarno is small but steeped in history. Excavations from the region have found burial urns dating from the bronze age, around the 14th century BC. It was also the location for talks after the First World War which formed the basis of a peace agreement signed by France, Germany, Belgium, England and Italy in London on December 1 1925.","Basti Hansen used a rented plane to travel up to 36,000ft before taking these amazing pictures .

The supercar in which Paul Walker died this week left professionals who tested it 'white' with fear and has been branded 'the most dangerous car on the road' by a former manufacturer. The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Roger Rodas when it crashed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, killing both of them. It has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light carbon-fibre frame and 5.7 litre race-derived V10 engine. Too dangerous? Both professionals and engineers have voiced concern about the supercar's suitability for the road . It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models. Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity when they launched the model in 2004. According to TMZ, a memo circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.' 'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.) 'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar. In a chequered past, the GT has been crashed by chat show legend Jay Leno, who lost control while speeding around a circuit in 2005. Another incident in 2005 saw two sportscar enthusiasts Ben Keaton and Corey Rudl killed in a racetrack smash in California after the Carrera GT they were travelling in swerved into a concrete wall. In that case, Porsche paid a portion of the $4.5million compensation fee awarded to the family of Mr Rudl after it was established there were 'handling problems' with the vehicle. Before its official release eight years ago, notable car experts gave excited but cautionary reviews of the GT, in which the cars power and speed were repeatedly lauded alongside notes about how it was prone to steering off course. Tragic: The aftermath of the car crash that killed Paul Walker showed the vehicle to be out of control. The car has a history of unpredictability, according to reports . In flames: The distinctive red finish of the Porsche could be seen engulfed in flames, above . Speaking about testing the car at Germany's famous Nurburgring, Walter Rohrl, a former world rally champion and Porsche test driver, told Drive magazine: '[It was] the first car in my life that I drive and I feel scared... I came back into the pits and I was white.' That was echoed by renowned car critic Jeremy Clarkson when he reviewed the Carrera for hit British BBC motor show Top Gear. 'The dangerous part is that it requires immense skill to drive, and is tremendously unforgiving.' - Doug DeMuro, former Porsche worker . During his test drive, the expert repeatedly lost control of the car on an empty race track. And, although being thrilled by its pace and power, he described the supercar's engine as a 'landmine'. He said: 'I have never felt anything like that. 'You need to be awake to drive this fast. It really isn't an easy car to control, the clutch is brutal, the power is savage, and the handling... you really are on a knife edge. 'Other cars forgive you, but make a mistake in that and it bites your head off. '[That] v.10 engine is a landmine'. Writing on car site Jalopnik.com, Doug DeMuro said: 'The most dangerous car on the road. Very sad. 'The dangerous part is that it requires immense skill to drive, and is tremendously unforgiving. 'And it's hard to understand the car's limits because it's unlike virtually any other car on the road, and it'll respond in ways other cars won't. Erratic: During a TV review first broadcast in Britiain in 2004, the Carrera GT was seen to be prone to swerving out of control . Caution: When reviewing the car in 2004, British TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson said the car was unforgiving, saying 'you need to be awake to drive this fast' Although the car was the fastest to complete a lap of the show's course Clarkson, described the motor's engine as a 'landmine' 'I personally think it's the most dangerous car out there for this reason, and I know several people - including a couple of former owners - who agree.' The 2005 crash for which Porsche accepted partial liability, bears a striking similarity to the accident which claimed the life of the Paul Walker and Roger Rodas. Then, Carrera GT owner Ben Keaton offered to give fellow car fan Corey Rudl a ride in his new sports car at the California Speedway track. After another driver in a Ferrari pulled out in front of the pair, they swerved to avoid a collision but careered straight into the track's concrete wall. After Mr Rudl's wife took legal action alleging the wrongful death of her husband Porsche agreed to pay eight per cent of a total $4.5 compensation fee. ENGINE SIZE: 5.7ltr . CYLINDERS: V10 . TOP SPEED: 205 mph . ACCELERATION: 0-62 mph = 3.9s . FUEL CONSUMPTION: 13.2 mpg . DRIVE TYPE: Rear Wheel Drive . GEARBOX: Manual, 6 Speed . UNLADEN WEIGHT: 3042 lbs OR 1380 kg . During the case it was established that the Carrera GT was designed without electronic stability control, which Porsche calls PSM. Craig McClellan, a former racer and a successful plaintiffs' attorney from San Diego represented the Rudls. He alleged the lack of a PSM system was probably a marketing decision as the model was initially billed as a 'race car for the streets' and track cars are generally made without a stabilising system to counter over-steer. Speaking after the settlement, he told SportsCarMarket.com that the Carrera GT should be 'feared'. He said:  'Most people, especially those with children on the streets and highways, would fear a vehicle like the Carrera GT, with its tricky handling characteristics, 600-plus horsepower, and unskilled, unqualified drivers. 'When a 'race car for the streets' is sold to anyone with enough money, regardless of his ability to drive it, and it doesn't even incorporate modern electronic safety devices that correct driver errors, then maybe the manufacturer should accept some responsibility for the foreseeable deaths that will result.' Mail Online have contacted Porsche but a spokesperson refused to comment.

British teenagers have dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time. Tests on more than half a million pupils worldwide found those in Vietnam, Shanghai and Poland have a much better command of the core subjects. Children in Shanghai are three years ahead of their British counterparts by the age of 15, according to the major international study published yesterday. Falling behind: British teenagers have dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time . Despite a near doubling of the education budget between 1997 and 2010 under Labour – from £50billion a year to £89billion – the study showed British children are still lagging. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the poor results showed radical reform was necessary in a ‘stagnating’ education system. Overall, the UK was ranked 26th out of 65 countries and major economic regions by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In maths the UK was 26th – although researchers said a truer position would be 31st – while in reading it was 23rd. A slump in science took Britain from 16th in 2009 to 21st place now. In 2006, British children came 14th in science, 17th in reading and 24th  in maths. The OECD bases its research on two hours of problem solving tests designed to assess how children use their knowledge and skills in real life. One in five British 15-year-olds had only the most basic level of numeracy. One in six struggled with basic literacy and one in seven had only a rudimentary understanding of science. In the UK, £59,719 is spent on each child between the ages of six and 15 compared with the equivalent of only £29,852 in Shanghai. Could do better: Around one in seven teenagers have no more than a basic understanding of science . Surprisingly the report found boys did better than girls in maths and science, with the gender gap in British schools wider than in most other countries. This suggests fewer girls will head into careers in technology, engineering and science. And in a snap shot of the culture of our schools 25 per cent of the British children who sat the OECD test had skipped lessons in the previous two weeks, compared with just 4 per cent in South Korea, Japan and Shanghai. Labour yesterday attempted to lay the blame on the Coalition, with education spokesman Tristram Hunt claiming its schools policy was ‘failing to confront the international challenge we face’. ‘This report exposes the failings of this Government’s schools policy: a policy that has sent unqualified teachers into the classroom and prevented effective collaboration between schools,’ he said. Coalition reforms since 2010 include the introduction of free schools, tougher exams, performance-related pay for teachers and recruiting more top graduates into classrooms. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s deputy director for education and skills, said: ‘You surely could not expect any reforms to take effect for 2012 when these reforms were just being implemented.’ Wales had by far the worst performance among the home nations. Based on its test scores, it would have been 41st in maths, 39th in reading and 36th in science in the OECD tables. Cardiff has been in charge of education policy since devolution in 1998, although pay, conditions and pensions are still handled by Westminster. One of the main differences is its commitment to community-led comprehensives. This means there are no free schools or academies, which are state-funded but free from council control – giving heads far more autonomy. Some foundation schools are independent from local authorities but legislation was introduced to stop more schools following their lead. Based on its OECD test results, England would have been 26th in maths, 23rd in reading and 18th in science. Out of the home nations, Scotland was top but still way below the international best. It would have been 25th in maths and 21st for reading but behind England in science at 22nd. Wales is ahead of England in introducing a new curriculum. Children aged between three and seven have been following a Scandinavian-influenced agenda which favours ‘experiential learning’ over formal instruction. The reforms were brought in five years ago, meaning they will not have fed through to the teenagers taking the OECD tests. The Scottish education system has a tradition of greater breadth of learning, with a wide range of subjects at secondary level than is seen in English schools. Mr Gove said: ‘These poor results show the last government failed to secure the improvements in school standards our young people desperately need. ‘Labour poured billions of pounds into schools and ratcheted up exam grades – yet our education system stagnated and we fell behind other nations.’ Mike Harris of the Institute of Directors said: ‘Unfortunately, thanks  to historic complacency, the UK appears to have its feet shackled at the starting line.’ UK spending on education is around 20 per cent higher than the OECD average but the report found no obvious benefit. ‘These comparative advantages do not have a clear relationship with educational outcomes,’ it said. Another OECD report, published in October, found the UK was the only wealthy country where teenagers and young adults were worse at maths and reading than their grandparents, despite years of rising exam grades. And a study from the Legatum Institute, a London-based think-tank, found education here lags behind poorer countries such as Lithuania and Latvia. The OECD’s PISA survey, (Programme for International Student Assessment), was based on 510,000 students. In the UK, 12,638 15-year-olds sat the two-hour problem-solving tests in 477 secondary schools in 2012. Asian countries such as China, South Korea and Singapore reinforced their reputation as educational powerhouses. Shanghai came top in every subject for the second time in a row. Katja Hall, the Confederation of British Industry’s chief policy director, said UK schools had been treading water and the report was a ‘wake-up call’. But experts claimed that even wide-ranging reforms would not close the gap with the leading nations because the UK lacks their work ethic. Joe Elliott, professor of education at Durham University, said: ‘While high-level teaching skills are essential for maximising student performance, at a national level these cannot have any impact without a culture of hard work, a drive to succeed educationally, backed up by strong support outside school. ‘Although, of course, many would say this kind of culture could be unhealthy.’ The NASUWT teaching union said that PISA provided only a snapshot and should not be used to ‘denigrate the hard  work, commitment and capability of teachers’.","Tests found pupils in Vietnam, Shanghai and Poland better at core subjects .

Children should start school when they are two to stop the most disadvantaged from slipping behind, according to the Ofsted chairman. Baroness Sally Morgan believes that a ‘big, bold, brave’ move is needed to tackle the under-achievement of under-fives from the poorest areas across the country. Currently most children in England go to nursery at the age of three or four before starting school in the September following their fourth birthday. Legally all children living in England have to be in full-time education by the term after their fifth birthday. But Baroness Morgan told an education seminar held in London that schools ‘could be two to 18 as far as I’m concerned’. She added: ‘If you could get them coming into school at a different level then it would save time and be transformative.’ The move comes amid complaints from teachers that too many children who are arriving at reception classes are still in nappies, unable to speak properly and lacking basic skills. Baroness Morgan believes changing the rules would mean ‘early intervention work, from the age of two, was really focused on the poorest children’. She said: ‘You’re much more likely to have them starting primary school, ready, without the big gap and ready to learn. ‘But at the moment, a lot of the children from really disadvantaged backgrounds are not ready to learn so the school almost has to provide nurturing before it can start to educate.’ A recent Ofsted report found that poor five-year-olds are still 19 months behind their more affluent peers. Baroness Morgan went on to say: ‘What a dire start to their educational life. Those children had low level social skills, especially reading and communication. They’re not ready to learn at school. ‘Weak parenting, low educational attainment of parents, poor diet, poor housing and so on – the gap between affluent and disadvantaged is greatest in that group.’ She added: ‘I think there needs to be a big, bold, brave move on the under-fives agenda to target funding heavily on the children who will benefit most and increasingly, I think, to look to strong providers to go further down the system.’ However, critics said that children are already expected to do ‘too much, too soon’ and should be allowed more time to play. Dr Richard House, from the Save Childhood Movement, labelled her comments as ‘completely misguided’. He said: ‘If this proposal happens, I think it could be a catastrophe for young children.’ He added: ‘What will happen is that early childhood is going to become “schoolified”. ‘That early childhood time when children are young – at least up to the age of five, and I would say six – is a period of their development and learning which has its own intrinsic value. ‘It shouldn’t be treated merely as a preparation for schooling.’ A recent Ofsted report found that poor five-year-olds are still 19 months behind their more affluent peers . A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We know that teacher-led early years education has a positive impact on children, especially on those from low income backgrounds. ‘That is why we are making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two by removing the requirement on them to register separately with Ofsted when doing so, and introducing 15 hours of free early education for 240,000 of the poorest two-year-olds. ‘Our wider reforms will ensure all children, regardless of their background, get a good start in life.’","Baroness Sally Morgan believes 'big, bold, brave' move is needed to tackle the under-achievement of under-fives from poorest areas of the country .

Debris from the rocket carrying China's first moon rover plummeted to earth in a village more than 620 miles (1,000 km) from the launch site, according to a report. People living near the wreckage claimed the metallic debris crashed into two homes and it is not the first time the area has been hit by rocket parts. The incident, which was reported on Monday, is believed to have occurred in Suining County in the central province of Hunan, around nine minutes after the launch of the Chang'e-3 mission. Shock: A man looks surprised to find what appears to be a rocket nose cone below a gaping hole in the roof of his barn, more than 1,000 kilometres away from the launch site of China's rocket . The area has been hit by space wreckage nearly 20 times, the Xiaoxiang Morning Post said. One local resident told the newspaper: ‘Three of the roof beams have crashed down on our house, and a big hole has been punched into our barn. Another said: ‘The huge sound scared the living daylights out of me.’ A picture shows a somewhat baffled-looking villager peering at the curved shape of what appears to be a rocket nose-cone, below a gaping hole in his roof. The incident, which was reported on Monday and is thought to have torn a hole in the roof of a small house, occurred around nine minutes after the launch of the Chang'e-3 mission in Suining county in the central province of Hunan . Authorities gave the residents 10,800 yuan (£1,081) and 5,200 yuan (£521) in compensation, according to the newspaper, which reported that no one was injured. A Long March-3B carrier rocket, China's most powerful rocket, blasted off at around 1:30 am Monday from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in south western China. The lunar rover mission known as 'Jade Rabbit' is part of China's ambitious space programme, which aims to establish a permanent space station by 2020 and eventually send a human to the moon. Debris from the rocket carrying China's first moon rover plummeted to earth in a village in Suining more than 620 miles (1,000 km) from the launch site, according to a report . This picture taken on December 2, 2013 shows a man pointing to debris from the rocket carrying China's first moon rover in a barn in Suining. One local resident said the huge noise of the crash scared the living daylights out of him . But debris from China's numerous space launches has frequently found its way to Suining county, which has been hit by rocket parts nearly 20 times since the early 1990s, according to the newspaper. Last May wreckage from a rocket sent up by the Xichang Launch Centre crashed into homes and hit a high-voltage wire in the area, according to the Shanghai Daily News. In October 2011 a steel frame weighing more than 250 kilograms, or 550 pounds, landed in a field after another satellite launch and other wreckage pierced a house roof. The Long March-3B rocket carrying the Chang'e-3 lunar probe blasts off from the launch pad at Xichang Satellite Launch Centre . China launched its first extra-terrestrial landing craft into orbit yesterday in the hope of becoming the first country in almost 40 years to soft-land a probe on the moon. The nation is only the third in history to launch an unmanned lunar probe, which has been nicknamed 'Jade Rabbit' after a Chinese folklore character. The probe, which can climb inclines of up to 30 degrees and travel up to 200 metres per hour, is targeted to land within a huge volcanic crater known as Sinus Iridum, which means the Bay of Rainbows, on about December 14 . President Xi Jinping has said he wants China to establish itself as a space superpower and the mission has inspired widespread pride in China's growing technological prowess. State television showed a live broadcast of the rocket lifting off. If all goes smoothly, the rover will conduct geological surveys and search for natural resources after the probe touches down on the moon in mid-December. It is designed to roam the lunar surface for at least 90 Earth days – three Lunar days – covering an area of about five square kilometres. It will send probes beneath the surface as well as taking high-resolution images of the rock, a flat area formed from the molten basalt released by lunar volcanoes several billion years ago. The journey of the probe and its final landing will be closely monitored by the European Space Agency (ESA), which is cooperating closely with China.","The incident is believed to have occurred nine minutes after the launch of the Chang'e-3 mission in Suining county in Hunan, China .

Spectacular footage of Australia's north west desert region has been captured, inadvertently, by a sea eagle that 'stole' a video camera and took it for a 70-mile flight. The lens recorded the bird's flapping wings - in sound and vision - the crevasses it flew through, the desert it crossed and finally the amusing moments when it landed and began pecking at the device. The motion-sensor camera had been set up by Aboriginal rangers in a gorge near the Margaret River last May in the hope of capturing images of fresh-water crocodiles. Scroll down for video . The sea eagle stole a camera set up to record crocodiles and inadvertently captured stunning footage of the Australian outback . The camera picks up the sound and view of the bird's wings as it flies for 70 miles . The camera had been set up to record fresh-water crocodiles but instead recorded the crevasses along the route taken by the bird . But within weeks the camera had disappeared. No-one, they agreed, would dare to steal it from croc territory, so they believed it had somehow fallen into the water. Then, just a few weeks ago, ranger Roneil Skeen and his colleagues received a message from a Parks and Wildlife ranger saying a small device had been found near another river more than 70 miles away. The video camera revealed the identity of the thief and just where the scoundrel had taken it. Rangers were able to extract three 30-second clips that showed the juvenile sea eagle scooping up the camera and taking to the air with it, capturing amazing scenes of the Australian outback. The stolen camera captured the stunning scenery of Australia's desert region . The curious sea eagle is then seen pecking at the camera after it finally lands after a long flight . When the camera was eventually deposited on firm ground, the eagle can be seen approaching the lens and pecking at it. 'There are 14 of us rangers and we've been pretty amazed at what we've seen on the camera,' said Mr Skeen, a member of the Gooniyandi Aboriginal tribe. 'We've had camera traps moved by animals before, but none of them have taken off - a sort of flying camera. It was quite incredible to see it'. Mr Skeen told the ABC: 'We knew this was a juvenile eagle because the adult sea eagles, once they get their food or their prey, they usually take it right up into the sky and drop it. It soon got bored and the camera was eventually found by rangers who then returned it . 'But this one was still learning because he just took it near the cliff-side and he never dropped it. He just put it down and started pecking at it. 'An adult one would have flown it right up the top and yeah, for sure, it would have smashed that camera.' It won't happen again, said Mr Skeen. He and his colleagues have resolved to bolt their camera down next time.","Lens recorded Australian north west desert as eagle went on 70-mile flight .

A leading U.S doctor believes that many cases of diagnosed ADHD are in fact sleeping disorders in disguise. Vatsal Thakkar, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine, says he is treating an increasing number of people with ADHD symptoms but who actually have suffer with poor quality sleep. For some people - especially children - sleep deprivation does not necessarily cause lethargy; instead they become hyperactive, forgetful and unfocused, he said. Disruptive: Children who are aggressive, impulsive and hyperactive are often diagnosed with ADHD but they could be suffering with a sleep disorder, says a leading exoert . It was a 31-year-old patient who alerted him to the link when he came for treatment because he was exhibiting the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). He was suffering with all the symptoms - including procrastination and forgetfulness - but his problems had only started two years earlier. In order to diagnose a person with ADHD, they must have experienced the symptoms since childhood, he says. In an article for New York Times, Professor Thakkar explained that his patient’s problems first developed the month he began his most recent job. It  required him to rise at 5am, despite the fact that he was a night owl. The professor realised he didn’t have ADHD but instead a chronic sleep deficit. ADHD is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. It is normally diagnosed between the ages of three to seven, and it is more common in boys. Although the cause of ADHD is not known, research shows that it tends to run in families. Some research also shows that there may be differences in the way the brain works in people with ADHD. It is the most common behavioural disorder in the UK and is estimated to affect two to five per cent of schoolchildren. There is no cure for attention . deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but treatment can alleviate your . symptoms and make the condition much less of a problem in day-to-day . life. ADHD can be treated using medication or psychiatric therapy, but . it is widely agreed a combination of both is most effective. He suggested techniques to help him fall asleep at night, such as relaxing for 90 minutes before getting in bed, and when he returned two weeks later, his symptoms were almost gone. Numerous studies have shown that we get less sleep than we used to. The number of adults who sleep fewer than seven hours each night has rocketed from two percent in 1960 to more than 35 per cent in 2011. And sleep is even more crucial for children, who need deep for proper growth and development. But according to recent research, today’s youngsters sleep more than an hour less than they did 100 years ago. And for all ages,  our daytime activities - marked by hectic schedules and all-pervasive technology - often impair sleep. The professor hypothesised that while it might just be a coincidence, this sleep-restrictive lifestyle began getting more extreme in the 1990s, the same decade as the explosion in ADHD cases. He went on explain that a number of studies have shown that a huge proportion of children with an ADHD diagnosis also have sleep-disordered breathing like apnoea or snoring, restless leg syndrome or non-restorative sleep, in which deep sleep is frequently interrupted. One study, published in 2004 in the journal Sleep, looked at 34 children with ADHD. Every one of them showed a deficit of deep sleep, compared with only a handful of the 32 control subjects. It is possible that ADHD symptoms can persist even after a sleeping problem is resolved. A study of more than 11,000 British children published last year, found that children who suffered from sleep-disordered breathing in infancy were more likely to have behavioural difficulties later in life. Children are sleeping an hour less than they did 100 years ago . These children were 20 to 60 per cent more likely to have behavioural problems at age 4, and 40 to 100 per cent more likely to have such problems at age seven. Interestingly, said Professor Thakkar, these problems occurred even if the disordered breathing had abated, implying that an infant breathing problem might cause some kind of potentially irreversible neurological injury. There is also some promising research being done on sleep in adults, relating to focus, memory and cognitive performance. And a study published three years ago in journal Sleep found that while people who were deprived of sleep didn’t necessarily feel sleepier, their cognitive performance declined and continued to worsen over five nights of sleep restriction. Professor Thakkar says we can wait no longer to pay attention to the connection between deep sleep and ADHD. He provides the example of clonidine, which began life as a high blood pressure drug, but has now been approved to treat ADHD. Studies have shown that when it is taken at bedtime, ADHD symptoms improve during the day. He says that for psychiatrists, it is one of these 'oh-we-don’t-know-how-it-works' drugs. But in fact   clonidine is a potent deep sleep enhancer.","Professor of psychiatry, Vatsal Thakkar, thinks poor sleep could be to blame .

Chicken nuggets are definitely made of chicken - just maybe not the parts you want to eat. Researchers in Mississippi conducted an 'autopsy' of chicken nuggets from two fast food chains in Jackson and confirmed what we all suspected about the mystery-meat medallions: they aren't too meaty. The first chicken nugget tested was made up of about 50 per cent muscle tissue from the breast or thigh and the rest was made up of unpalatable parts: fat, blood vessels, and nerves. What's in a nugget? Researchers in Mississippi examined two fast-food chains' chicken nuggets and found that half or less than half of the nuggets were made of meat. The rest was made of high-fat chicken parts . The second chicken nugget was even worse with out 40 per cent muscle, with the rest being made up of fat cartilage and bone. The researchers decided not to name the fast food chains. Dr Richard D deShazo, the study's lead researcher, encourages his patients to eat white chicken meat and while chicken nuggets may look white on the inside, looks can be deceiving. 'What has happened is that some companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts rather than low-fat chicken white meat, batter it up and fry it and still call it chicken,' Dr deShazo told Reuters. 'It is really a chicken by-product high in calories, salt, sugar and fat that is a very unhealthy choice. Even worse, it tastes great and kids love it and it is marketed to them.' While it's OK to indulge in the junk food every so often, the problem for deShazo is that some people eat them multiple times a week. Don't make it a habit: Dr deShazo, the lead researcher of the study, said it's OK to eat chicken nuggets every once in a while but he's concerned for the people who eat them multiple times a week . Ashley Peterson, a representative of the National Chicken Council, a non-profit trade group which represents the U.S. chicken industry, argued that consumers weren't being mislead. She pointed out that nutritional information for most fast food chains is available online, and that anything for sale at the grocery store has a list of ingredients. 'Chicken nuggets tend to have an elevated fat content because they are breaded and fried. But it's no secret what is in a chicken nugget,' she said.","Researchers in Mississippi examined chicken nuggets at two different fast food chains and found that only about half of the nuggets were made of muscle meat .

Britain should be grateful that Romanians and Bulgarians take jobs shunned by local workers, according to a senior minister in Bucharest. Mariana Campeanu, Romania’s labour minister, said migrants ‘contribute greatly to GDP’ and should be welcomed for filling vacancies in agriculture and hospitality. She said Britons living off the welfare state were refusing to take jobs in these sectors. Romanian Minister for Labour Mariana Campeanu (left) said Britain should be grateful that Romanians and Bulgarians take jobs shunned by local workers . Mrs Campeanu told the Times her countrymen were already meeting shortfalls in key UK professions such as nursing and social care. Restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarians working in Britain will be lifted on January 1, raising fears of a massive influx. And last week David Cameron pledged to restrict welfare benefits on people from the two states if they come to Britain. But Mrs Campeanu said the majority of Romanians here were economic migrants who did not come to claim benefits. ‘I do not know in depth the British social welfare system, this is an internal issue of the British government how generous it can be in its welfare system toward its citizens,’ Mrs Campeanu said. ‘This should maybe be a reason why many British people do not access the vacancies on the labour market for which Romanian citizens, for example, are going to apply. ‘If there are any vacancies, somebody will fill them, whether they are from Romania, Italy, Spain or wherever.’ The Romanian prime minister, Victor Ponta, has also demanded his countrymen are not treated as ‘second-rate citizens’ by Mr Cameron’s proposal to delay benefits for three months. And last month the Bulgarian ambassador Konstantin Dimitrov hit out at ‘anti-Bulgarian propaganda’ from some British politicians which he said served only to agitate ‘social tension’ in the UK. Mrs Campeanu said: ‘Taking into account the fact that Romanian citizens in the UK contribute greatly to the GDP and also that many of these people are young and well qualified, the UK should be grateful that these people have come to live there.’ Romanians queuing for visas at a British embassy . During the Ask Boris programme on LBC Radio yesterday, London Mayor Boris Johnson said the benefits block could continue in the short term because of intense competition for jobs that left ‘many young Londoners who feel they are not getting a fair suck of the sauce bottle’. Mrs Campeanu said there were staff shortages in some areas because of the EU freedom of movement policy. ‘Many doctors and nurses and other healthcare staff are coming to work in the UK and these are well-qualified personnel that will contribute highly to the welfare of the British people, at the same time depriving Romanian citizens of social assistance here,’ she added. ‘We have a deficit of 10,000 care workers and if we look at the entire medical sector, we are talking of a shortage of over 20,000 people.’ Mrs Campeanu also said Britain should be less suspicious of foreigners. ‘It is unacceptable in the 21st century that expressions of racism and xenophobia are taking place and it is more regretful that they are taking place in Great Britain,’ she insisted.","Mariana Campeanu said migrants ‘contribute greatly to GDP’

Tragic: Private Andrew Murgatroyd died after downing 16 shots of 'Top Shelf' alcohol in just 30 minutes, an inquest heard today . A soldier died after downing 16 shots of 'Top Shelf' alcohol in just 30 minutes - causing him to choke on his own vomit. Private Andrew Murgatroyd, 21, was plied with a lethal cocktail of shots at his barracks leaving party in Hullavington, Wiltshire, an inquest heard today. He 'necked' 16 measures of the mixed spirits - which had been decanted from all of the optics in the camp's bar - before passing out. The married soldier, who had been celebrating his transfer to a new posting, then started to choke on his own vomit. Despite his friends' frantic efforts to save his life, he was pronounced dead at his army quarters at Buckley Barracks. Now, a coroner is planning to raise the army's 'drinking culture' with Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. Pvt Murgatroyd, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had downed two trays of so-called 'Top Shelf' shots during his send-off, the inquest in Salisbury heard. The lethal cocktail - which had been banned by army chiefs - contained shots from all of the eight optics in the camp's bar. They had been decanted into a tumbler and 'necked' by the soldier - who was not a regular drinker - in just half an hour, according to witnesses. The shots included measures of vodka, whisky, Morgan Spiced rum, Southern . Comfort, Lamb’s Navy Rum, Barcardi, Archers and Malibu. Pvt Murgatroyd, who was being reposted to Aldershot Barracks in Hampshire, was also forced to stand on a chair and down two cans of lager during the party on February 14 this year. He passed out on a sofa and was carried to a car by his friends, which took him to his home on the barracks - just a two-minute drive away. 'A lovely husband': Pvt Murgatroyed, pictured with his wife Shawni, had been celebrating his new army posting . However, as he was being carried upstairs by a friend, his wife Shawni Murgatroyd, 21, noticed his face had turned blue and he had stopped breathing. His friends performed CPR, but Pvt Murgatoyd was declared dead by paramedics who arrived at his home in an air ambulance half an hour later. A pathologist found he had died from choking on his own vomit while acutely intoxicated, with more than 320mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system - almost four times the drink-drive limit. Major Timothy Parkes, of the Royal Logistic Corps, told the inquest that 'Top Shelves' have been 'frowned upon' in the army for the last 25 years. Scene: The soldier was pronounced dead at his army quarters at Buckley Barracks, pictured, in Hullavington . 'I can only say sorry to the family for what has gone wrong,' he said. 'I wish I could turn the clock back. It is such a waste.' The inquest heard the barracks bar was run by a contracted firm called Elior, which had not been told that 'Top Shelf' drinks were banned under Army regulations. Today, Mrs Murgatroyd recalled the moment she realised her husband was choking. 'When they were carrying upstairs, I noticed he had gone blue,' she said. 'It was a matter of minutes. I said to Gary ""he’s gone blue"" and there was vomit coming down out of his mouth.' Speaking after the inquest, she added: 'Andrew was such a lovely guy and I loved him so much. We had so many plans together and now it is all gone. 'I’m just taking it each day as it comes and I’ve got brilliant support around me.' Swindon and Wiltshire coroner Ian Singleton recorded a narrative verdict and singled out the army's 'drinking culture' for criticism. 'This was a tragic and unnecessary death at a time when Andrew was looking forward to a new posting,' he said. 'There was a lack of appreciation of what the combined effects of such an amount of alcohol would be on Andrew, who was not a regular, heavy drinker.' He added: 'I am concerned that a culture appears to exist to ply someone with alcohol and I am concerned that culture is not isolated to Buckley Barracks. 'I intend to write to the Defence Secretary to outline my concerns.'","Private Andrew Murgatroyd, 21, downed 16 shots at Buckley Barracks .

As your eyes linger on the azure sky and sandy shore, a multitude of exotic locations easily spring to mind. And when shown this picture of a perfect beach, a quarter of adults were sure it was in St Tropez. In fact, the photograph was taken much closer to home – on the Cornish shores of St Ives. The beauty spot is just one of a host of Britain’s best locations which we actually think are abroad, according to a survey. Mediterranean paradise? Not quite, it's St Ives in Cornwall - but half of people in a survey thought it was St Tropez . Picturesque, but not Cornwall: St Tropez, Cote d´Azur, South of France . As well as thinking St Ives was on the . French Riviera, respondents thought Portsmouth’s Spinnaker Tower was a . landmark in Dubai, and mistook parts of the Isles of Scilly for both the . Cayman Islands and the Maldives. More than half of the 2,000 adults thought a stretch of water in the Lake District was actually Lake Geneva in Switzerland. Some of the 2,000 adults even mistook Bristol’s Clifton Suspension Bridge was the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Those surveyed were shown an image of the Isles of Scilly... ... but many thought it was the Maldives in the Indian Ocean . And while St Ives may not quite have the glitz and glamour of St Tropez, it is becoming a resort where visitors and residents are prepared to pay a premium. Last year five parking spaces in the small town sold for over £50,000 each. And earlier this year the Mail reported on a three-bedroom rental property which tripled in price in the Easter break from £889 a week to £2,899, and then up to a staggering £4,499 in the peak weeks of July and August.But St Ives also has its unappealing aspects. This summer the RSPB received three times as many calls complaining about seagulls which are known for dive bombing locals and visitors. A spokesman for First Great Western, which carried out the survey, said yesterday: ‘We live in a fantastic country, but this research shows that many of us simply aren’t aware of the amazing places on our doorstep just waiting to be discovered.’ Their research marked the train company’s launch of a Facebook app, Inside Track, which it is claimed offers ‘real insight to the must-do experiences and must-see places of the UK’. The spokesman continued: ‘We’re passionate about all the UK has to offer, so wanted to help Brits share in it too by giving them the Inside Track.’ The app is meant to provide local information that normally only residents would be privy to, and includes a woodland walk in The Cotswolds recommended by musician Alex James, to a tucked away Somerset boutique frequented by the model Daisy Lowe.","Brits were shown beauty spots, but many thought they were exotic locales .

Sylvia Pope usually starts hanging her decorations up in September to get them ready for Christmas as it takes her so long to attach them all to her ceiling one-by-one. However, this year it really has been Christmas every day for the 70-year-old, after an operation on her knee meant she was unable to scale a stepladder to take them all down again last January. Collection: Sylvia Pope has kept her 1,800 festive baubles hanging up all year after an operation meant she was unable to take them down . Process: It takes Sylvia so long to hang her decorations one-by-one that she usually starts putting them up in September . Instead Sylvia's beloved baubles - worth more than £20,000 - have been up for 12 months, making the living room of her home in Morriston, Swansea, a year-round Santa's grotto. 'They stayed up after last Christmas - and they've been there ever since,' said the retired bingo caller.

Attacks on Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington for the way she looks have been condemned in Parliament. Tanni Grey-Thompson, the Paralympian champion, said the swimmer’s tearful confession about her body image concerns on I’m A Celebrity last week served as a warning about the pressure women face. And a government minister said the ordeal faced by Adlington was ‘enough to make me weep’. Scroll down for video . Tissues and issues: Rebecca becomes teary and upset as she admits rival Amy Willerton makes her feel insecure about her body . Adlington burst into tears taking part in the ITV reality show as she admitted her rival in the show, beauty queen Amy Willerton, made her feel insecure about her body. The 24-year-old revealed she has struggled with abusive comments about her looks for years, saying: ‘It’s making me very, very  insecure that I have to look [a certain way].  For me, I was an athlete. 'I wasn’t trying to be a model, but pretty much every single week on Twitter I get somebody commenting on the way I look.’ Miss Willerton, 21, tried to comfort her fellow ITV contestant, claiming she had also experienced unkind remarks as a young girl. She said: 'People say nasty things and you have to drive your inner confidence.' Baroness Grey Thompson used a debate in the Lords to warn body image anxiety is a leading cause of depression and low self-esteem, triggering problems at school and work for many women. Jungle girls: The retired  swimmer – who has won . two Olympic gold medals – had to be comforted by her fellow female . contestants after the sight of the bikini-clad model became too much for . her to bear . She said: ‘Anyone who was watching Rebecca Adlington on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here last week will have seen her tearful reaction when talking about body image. ‘This is a young woman that we should all be proud of. She is a four-time Olympic medalist and a world champion, but many will understand how she feels. ‘It is a worrying trend that young women are increasingly put under pressure to conform to look a certain way.’ She added that if at the age of 15 she had thought she had poor body image she ‘would have been told to pull myself together’. But she warned that ‘body image has become more important than health… the majority of young people would rather be thin than healthy’. Baroness Grey-Thompson used a debate in the Lords to warn body image anxiety is a leading cause of depression and low self-esteem . ‘The reality is that young women are facing pressure from many directions. ‘For many women, a poor body image and lack of self-confidence is the biggest barrier that prevents them being active and it is easy to understand why. ‘Bizarrely it is one of the things that could help them. If you put “Jessica Ennis” and “abs” in to a search engine, there are pages that show how you can look like Jess in just two minutes a day. The reality is more like six hours a day, 50 weeks of the year for about 15 years.’ She also singled out comments about former Big Brother winner Chantelle Houghton who was ‘heavily criticised for going out jogging in a pair of running tights and a cropped top’. Baroness Grey Thompson  added: ‘The obsession with how quickly celebrities lose their baby weight and get back into their pair of jeans puts undue pressure on others.’ Baroness Kidron, a cross-bencher, said: ‘How important is it for the young women whom we are discussing in this room that the vilification and objectification of sportswomen, such as Rebecca Adlington or Marion Bartoli, to name just two, should be simply unacceptable.’ Lib Dem Baroness Northover, speaking for the government, said: ‘It is enough to make me weep to hear about Rebecca Adlington.’ She said her own children trained at the same swimming club as Adlington’s fiancé, Harry Needs. ‘I know about the early mornings, the late nights, the galas and the falling into bed absolutely exhausted. ‘That is what she has done, and much more, to get to where she is. She should be proud of what she has achieved, and we should be proud of what she has achieved. ‘As we celebrate people’s diversity and encourage girls, as well as boys, to have the confidence to participate in sport, keep themselves fit and find satisfaction in doing so, we will help to address this linkage between how people view themselves and their body and the way they participate in society and, through that, in sport.’","Olympic gold medalist Rebbecca Adlington broke down on I'm A Celebrity .

Lizzie Jennings, 54, has set up a free festive 'drunk tank' in the beer garden of her pub in Worcestershire . It is the time of year to eat, drink, and be merry, but many people who over-indulge can be faced with a dilemma over how to get home. Except revellers at the Drum and Monkey in Worcestershire, who can simply sleep it off in one of eight tents which have been set up in the beer garden. Landlady Lizzie Jennings, 54, is providing her punters with a free Christmas 'drunk tank' including luxury sleeping bags, foam mattresses, and even a bacon sandwich and a cup of tea when they wake up. Lizzie - who has run the rural pub for eight months - said she came up with the idea for the mini campsite with regular and tent maker Daniel Walton, 37. She said: 'We were talking about the Christmas period and drink driving and ways we could curb it this year. 'There was so much interest in paid-for drunk tanks earlier this year and we thought it was a good idea to offer customers a chance to put their heads down. 'But I wanted to offer my customers a free facility as it's the season of goodwill after all. 'Dan said he would lend me some tents, which was really nice of him. 'I'll even be offering my overnight guests a mug of hot tea and a bacon buttie the next morning before sending them on their way. 'We want people to come and have a good night and this way they can stop for an extra glass of wine if they want to. Between December 3 and January 1 up to 19 drinkers who over-indulge can sleep in one of the eight tents which come with luxury sleeping bags, foam mattresses, and even a heater to keep warm . In the morning, after sleeping off the worst of it, Lizzie is even offering a bacon butty and a cup of tea to help people deal with the hangover . Lizzie came up with the idea with pub regular and tent-maker Daniel Walton who loaned her the tents for free . 'We are cut off a little bit from public transport here so we hope this can deter people from getting in their cars after a few too many and keep themselves and others from harm. 'Most of the customers are farmers so they rely on driving, so we wouldn't want them to risk getting banned. 'This way people don't have to go far to get the experience of camping after a night out in a traditional British country pub.' Daniel, who runs an online tent manufacturing business, has loaned eight of his tents to the drinking establishment for the Christmas period. Mr Walton, 37, (pictured) says he hopes the idea will catch on and deter people from drink driving . Ms Jennings, who has been in charge of the rural pub for eight months, explained that drink driving was a particular problem for her customers as the bar is cut off from most public transport . He said: 'Family and friends a can stay in their own tent, we have an eight berth, four berth and a six berth tent so there is a lot of room for everyone. 'The area is quite rural, so it does attract campers and walkers. 'We do have heaters in there and it is very warm, the tent is completely sealed and is very snug inside with pillows, sleeping bags and night-lights. 'I hope the idea will catch on - it will hopefully deter people from drink driving, which is always a problem this time of year.' Punter Craig Walker, 30, added: 'It's like going camping with your mates except you don't have as far to stumble back to your tent in the dark after you've had a few - it's brilliant.' Customers can stay in the tents at the pub for free between December 3 and January 1.","The Drum and Monkey in Worcestershire is offering a 'drunk tank'

A village shop is claiming to be Britain's cheapest supermarket because customers can get up to two thirds off the price of groceries. The discount store is the first 'social supermarket' run by Community Shop and it is designed to help families who are stuck in food property. Up to 500 people can become a member of the shop, set up in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire, as long as they claim one of a specified list of benefits including Employment Support Allowance. Supermarket: Low income families can apply to become a member of the Community Shop in Goldthorpe . Stock: Shoppers can choose food and household goods at a reduced price as they would be thrown out by bigger supermarkets due to damage or labeling errors. Instead they will be sold to hard-up families . Wide range: Community Shop manager Sarah Dunwell is director of social affairs at Company Shop. The store will offer a wide range of food to people provided they are receiving one of a list of benefits . Stock will arrive daily from manufacturers and suppliers with the permission of shops such as Tesco, Asda, Marks and Spencer, Morrisons and Ocado. Social entrepreneur Sarah Dunwell is director of social affairs at Company Shop which is the parent company of Community Shop. Company Shop is the largest re distributor of surplus food in the UK. She said 500 people will be given membership for six months to test whether the social supermarket idea works with the hope of launching 20 nationwide next year, including six in London. She said: 'We are aiming to fill a gap between foodbanks and mainstream retail. Lots of families are not in such an emergency situation but are on the cusp of food poverty. 'It is for anyone who is claiming any of a list of benefits. It's not just  about the long-term unemployed but really hard-working families who are  struggling. Fresh: Community Shop manager Sarah Dunwell said 500 people will be given membership for six months to test whether the social supermarket idea works. If successful, she wants to open 20 including six in London . Toiletries: As well as food, other household products will be on offer when the supermarket opens on December 9. Stock will arrive daily from manufacturers and suppliers with permission from supermarkets . Cheap: Some top brands that would sell for much more in big-name supermarkets will be on offer at the community store for a fraction of the price to help people in food poverty eat well for less . 'It's more than about just cheap food. We offer a full package of support with  a cafe, a cookery school, support for people who need advice on payday lending, alcohol support and domestic violence among other things.' She explained that the supermarket, which won't sell alcohol or tobacco, will use residual food not needed by the larger supermarkets for a variety of  reasons including damaged packaging or the wrong labelling. 'We'll have staples such as sugar, pasta and rice but also more expensive goods such as French cheeses, ready-made lasagne and desserts and household products,' she explained. 'This is not cheap food for the poor, it will bring a huge range of foods. Helping hand: Cut price brand names will be on sale at the new store which organisers hope will be the first of many across the UK aimed at helping families living in food poverty and struggling to buy food for themselves . Community: Sarah Dunwell wants the supermarket to 'fill a gap between foodbanks and mainstream retail' Wrong packaging: The store takes goods, including food and toiletries, from supermarkets that are damaged or have been incorrectly labelled and sells them for a low price to struggling families who become members . 'It takes stuff that will not make it to supermarket shelves and uses it to  feed people who need it most. 'While we have people in the UK going hungry it is wrong such foods should be thrown away.'Members will be assessed at the end of six months with the aim being that they no longer need the social supermarket. Leaflets publicising the scheme have already been delivered to homes in Goldthorpe, which is being targeted as an area of serious poverty. The shop will open on December 9. Incorrect: Yoghurts with incorrect packaging will be sold at the first community supermarket in the UK which opens in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire. The store is a pilot scheme to see if the idea will work . Membership: A customer swipes their membership card to enter the community supermarket. As well as sugar, pasta and rice there will also be more expensive goods such as French cheeses and desserts .

Prosecutors say British authorities alerted a U.S. diplomat last month that someone had sent the X-rated images to an undercover investigator. Scroll down for video . 'Pervert': Robert Schrader (not pictured), 33, has been charged with producing child pornography after he allegedly sent X-rated images of his infant son to a British undercover officer . Authorities say data embedded in the images showed they were taken in the area of Schrader's one-story home in Littlerock. Investigators searched the home and determined the boy in the pictures is his son, Los Angeles Daily News reported. . A Homeland Security official says the baby is one of the youngest child pornography victims ever identified in the Los Angeles area, if not the youngest. The allegations against Schrader, a landscaper,  first came to light January 29 when a British official contacted a Homeland Security attache in London about an American national who was caught using a Yahoo email account to send explicit images featuring an infant to an undercover officer in the UK. Law enactment in California searched Schrader’s home after identifying him as the user of the Yahoo account and found his 3-month-old son, who was removed the same day by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. House of horrors: Officials searched Schrader's home in Littlerock, California, and discovered a cache of exploits images, among them some featuring his 3-month-old son . Officers armed with a search warrant also seized baby clothing from the suspect's home along with computer equipment. They also allegedly uncovered hundreds of explicit images and a video showing children, among them the suspect’s son. Schrader had sole custody of the infant. It remains unknown what has become of the child's mother. According to court documents cited by CBS Los Angeles, Schrader discussed with the undercover officer his sexual interest in young boys. ‘I have a 3mo boy. Do u like boy? If so, Tell me what u want me to do to him,’ Schrader allegedly wrote in an email. The nine-page criminal complaint states that the 33-year-old landscaper ‘got caught up in the moment for the purpose of sexual gratification. He would communicate with people online sexually abusing children…and stated that it was just a game.’ Schrader has been charged with two counts of producing child pornography. If convicted, he could face up to 60 years in prison.","Robert Schrader, 33, charged with producing child pornography after he allegedly sent X-rated images to British undercover officer .

A giant Burmese python discovered in the Florida Everglades is believed to be the biggest ever found in the area, measuring more than 18 feet. Experts believe the monster snake will beat the current record, for the longest python found in the area, which currently stands at around 17ft. Record-breaker: A giant female Burmese python has been found in the Florida Everglades, prompting experts to speculate it is the biggest ever discovered in the area, measuring more than 18ft . engineers during a routine inspection of levees before being killed and its corpse moved to the University of Florida where it will be measured and studied by scientists . The female reptile was discovered by Bobby Hill, the python control officer for the South Florida Management District on Tuesday, the Miami Herald reported. The snake carcass is set to be transferred to the University of Florida, where experts working to stop the spread of the invasive species will verify its length and weight after studying the remains. District spokesman Randy Smith, said: 'It looks to be about 18 feet. 'It could very well be a state record.' In May last year, snake collector Jason Leon, captured the current record-holder, slicing off the beast's head to subdue the powerful creature. The Florida Fish and Wild Conservation Commission revealed the female snake measured 18ft 8ins and weighed 128lbs. Prior to that the largest found in the everglades was a 17ft female Burmese python, which was pregnant with 87 eggs and weighed more than 164lbs. The everglades' waterways have been found to be home to some of the largest snakes captured in south Florida. The cold-blooded creatures are often spotted warming their bodies in the sun on rocky embankments. Natural habitat: A number of giant Burmese pythons have been discovered in the waterways of the Florida Everglades, pictured, in recent years. Last May a female measuring 18ft 8ins and weighing 128lbs was found by snake collector Jason Leon . Giant: Burmese pythons are one of the largest breed of snake in the world . Burmese pythons are among the world's largest snakes, measuring up to 23ft and weighing up to 200lbs, with a girth similar to that of a telephone pole. The creatures are distinguished by their striking patterned skin. That combined with their generally docile nature and rapid growth rate make the breed popular among reptile owners. The snakes are native to jungles and grassy marshes and are commonly found in southeast Asia. Young snakes are often found in the trees, but as they mature are grow in size tree-climbing becomes more difficult. As a result adults spend most of their time on the jungle floor. They are excellent swimmers and can stay underwater for around half an hour. Burmese pythons are carnivores and feast on small mammals and birds. Suffering from poor eyesight, the reptiles rely on chemical receptors in their tongues and heat sensors along their body to detect and hunt their prey. A member of the constrictor family, the pythons squeeze their prey to death, grabbing at their victims with their sharp teeth before suffocating the animal. Stretchy ligaments in their jaws enable the breed to swallow their prey whole. Females lay up to 100 eggs at a time, which they then incubate for two to three months. The species is on the threatened list, because of persistent hunters targeting the snakes for their skins, as well as the depletion of their natural habitat. In Florida experts regard the breed as a significant threat to native wildlife. Post mortems on dead snakes have found the breed eat almost anything that lives in the everglades, including aligators. A study in 2012 suggests the rise in the number of pythons in the area has decimated the park's small mammal population.","Python control officer Bobby Hill found the female reptile on Tuesday .

Sloop, 35, pleaded guilty but mentally ill to aggravated murder for the 2010 death of Ethan Stacy, who was found near Powder Mountain in Weber Country with his face disfigured by hammer blows and his grave sprinkled with dog food. Sloop was immediately sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the murder and 1 to 15 years for aggravated assault by a prisoner for attacking a David County jail officer.

'That boy died on my watch, and I’m horribly sorry,' Nathan Sloop told 2nd District Judge Glen Dawson, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. He said he wanted to plead guilty on Tuesday to accept responsibility for his actions. 'I want to apologize to all those who were affected by my reckless indifference to Ethan Stacy,' Sloop said.

Previous court documents show Sloop was prescribed 4,146 pills in an 11-month period. Among the prescriptions were Lortab, Valium, Percocet, Xanax and an antihistamine. Davis County Attorney Troy Rawlings told Dawson on Tuesday that while Ethan’s father, Joe Stacy, was in the courtroom, he was too emotional to make a statement before the sentence was handed down.

Bill de Blasio, the Mayor of New York, is to boycott the 250 year old St Patrick's Day march in New York in protest over gay rights. De Blasio will be the first mayor for over 20 years not to march in the famous Irish parade down Fifth Avenue on March 17 because he objects to the ban put in place on people who carry gay-pride signs. 'I am not planning on marching in the parade,' Mayor de Blasio said in comments carried by the New York Times. New York Mayor Bill De Blasio has refused to take part in the St Patrick's Day parade this year . Irish cheer: Some praised De Blasio's decision to boycott the 250-year-old parade . 'I will be participating in a number of other events to honor the Irish heritage of this city, but I simply disagree with the organizers of that parade,' he added. Event organizers have said gays can participate in the march - expected to attract around 1 million people - but have said they are forbidden from advertising their sexuality. Some rallied behind the mayor's decision, like City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. 'I have an incredibly strong trajectory of being a strong ally on issues regarding social justice and equity for the LGBTQ community, so I will definitely not march,' she said. 'The mayor took a very bold step and decision in deciding not to march.' Openly gay public officials in the city have also said they will miss the event. City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who was arrested at the parade with a gay-pride banner in 2000, said de Blasio had taken a 'strong stand against discrimination'. 'I find it offensive that the parade takes a formal and hard line that I canâ€™t participate,' Van Bramer said. 'That literally shuts out huge portions of our city.' Organizers of the event say gays are welcome but can't display their sexual orientation . Others disagreed. President of the Catholic League Bill Donohue lambasted the mayor's announcement. 'Personally, I am delighted,' Donohue said in a statement posted on the Catholic Leagueâ€™s website. 'I do not want to march with a public official who does not want to be associated with Irish Catholics,' he added. It was back in 1993 that a New York mayor chose not to march in the parade. David Dinkins declined to take part because of similar reasons. Former mayor Michael Bloomberg was Irish American and marched every year. Blasio, the first Democrat mayor since 1994, has already raised eyebrows in some quarters with his pledge to tackle inequality in the city by raising taxes on the super rich. New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade is one of the U.S.'s oldest Irish traditions. It marched for the first time more than 250 years ago, on March 17, 1762 - 14 years before the Declaration of Independence.","Bill de Blasio won't march in famous Irish parade in protest over gay rights .

Ham said the world was created in seven days as explained in the Bible, while Nye argued that the earth resulted from the big bang and teaching children otherwise would lead to America's demise as a world power. 'If we continue to eschew science ... we are not going to move forward,' Nye said. 'We will not embrace natural laws. We will not make discoveries. We will not invent and innovate and stay ahead.' Scroll down for video . Where do we come from? Bill Nye (left), famous . for his 90s television show 'Bill Nye the Science Guy', debated . Genesis-believer Ken Ham (right) Tuesday night in an attempt to prove . evolution . Well-attended: The debate was held at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, which was founded by Ham. It was estimated that more than a million people streamed the debate online and 900 people were in the audience . The debate took place Tuesday night to a packed house of 900 at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky - which Ham founded. Nye, popular for his 90s TV show 'Bill Nye the Science Guy', agreed to the debate and the museum paid his estimated 50-75,000 speaking fees. The museum charged $25 per ticket which didn't come close to covering the cost of the debate, though they hope to make up money be selling DVDs of the event. Learning can be fun: On his show, Bill Nye explained scientific theories in an entertaining way. The show ran from 1993 to 1998 . After five-minute opening statements, both Ham and Nye had half an hour to give prepared speeches on how they believe Earth originated, backing their arguments with photos and charts. The tame debate was moderated by CNN Reporter Tom Foreman, who rarely interrupted the pair, and the audience was mostly quiet except to applaud the debaters at the end of their speeches. During his argument, Ham stressed that there exists a difference between 'observational science' and 'historical science'. Observational . science is what you can see and test through experiments, and . historical science is what you can interpret about the past based on . existing evidence. But Nye countered that argument, saying that the natural laws observed today hold just as true in the past. Nye . points to evidence like Antarctic ice cores that have recorded seasonal . highs and lows in temperatures dating back 680,000 years to disprove . Ham's argument that the Earth was created just 6,000 years ago. And . if the Great Flood really happened as explained in the story of Noah's . Ark, there should be Kangaroos in the Middle East or between there and . Australia. In . the end, Nye said it was fine to have faith in a religion but that . doesn't mean you can't believe in scientific theories as well. 'I . just want to remind us all there are billions of people in the world . who are deeply religious, who get enriched by the wonderful sense of . community by their religion,'Nye said. 'But these same people do not . embrace the extraordinary view that the Earth is somehow only 6,000 . years old.' Ham argued a . similar sentiment, pointing to several famous scientists who have . publically stated that they believe in creation - including MRI inventor . Ray Damadian. 'I believe the word 'science' has been hijacked by secularists,' Ham said. Atheist .

While . many on Twitter expressed the opinion that Nye won the debate, . academics who believe in evolution say in the end Nye only helped Ham . publicize his museum. The . museum is currently fundraising to build a $60million Noah's Ark theme . park in Grant County, Kentucky but was previously having a  hard time . getting the project going. 'Nye's . appearance will be giving money to organizations who try to subvert the . mission Nye has had all his life: science education, particularly of . kids,' Jerry Coyne, professor of ecology and evolution at the University . of Chicago wrote on his blog.

Different stories: A human woman is pictured living at the same time as dinosaurs in another exhibit, though scientists argue that humans didn't evolve until after the extinction of dinosaurs . In 2012, Nye posted a video urging parents not to teach their children creationism, even if they themselves believe it. 'I . say to the grown-ups, if you want to deny evolution and live in your . world, in your world that's completely inconsistent with everything we . observe in the universe, that's fine,' Nye said in the video.

Actor turned author: Researchers only recently discovered that Chaplin (pictured) wrote a book in 1948 . A virtually unknown novel by Charlie Chaplin is now being made public for the first time. The comic actor’s only novel is titled ‘Footlights’ and is believed to be the basis for his film ‘Limelight’. The book was written in 1948 and has a similar plot line to the 1952 film in which a washed-out clown saves a dancer from suicide. The book is being published in English by the Cineteca di Bologna, an Italian film restoration institute which has been working with Chaplin biographer David Robinson on reconstructing drafts found in the Chaplin archives. Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in London in 1889 to poor parents, who struggled to make a living as music hall entertainers. As an adolescent, he began working in music halls in Soho, before eventually becoming an actor with a theatre troupe. In his first appearance on the silver screen in the 1914 'Making a Living', Chaplin plays a swindler -- complete with the hat, cane, moustache and baggy trousers he would become famous for around the world. According to Robinson, the relationship between drunken clown and desperate ballerina in the much later 'Footlights' was likely inspired by his meeting with legendary Russian dancer Vaslav Nijinsky in 1916. The Cinetaca describes Chaplin's 'vivid, idiosyncratic' writing style which, 'unadulterated by editors, moves freely from the baldly colloquial to moments of rich imagery and Dickensian description. Similarities: His book Footlights, which will be released today, has a similar plot to that of his 1952 film Limelight wherein a washed-out clown saves a dancer from suicide (Claire Bloom and Chaplin seen at right in the film) 'For a setting, he looked back to London and the music halls of his first professional years, an enchanted period in which he had broken out of the deprivations of his childhood to discover, progressively, his unique gifts as entertainer and communicator,' the institute said in a statement. 'But this retrospect also recalled the painful insecurity of an uneducated, uncultured boy launched into the world of success', and the clown's expressions of despair at losing the world's respect and admiration likely reflected Chaplin's own feelings as his popularity dwindled. The book is illustrated with previously unpublished documents and photographs from the Chaplin archives, as well as pictures of the theatrical world of Chaplin’s youth and images from the author's private collection.","Researchers only just discovered that Chaplin wrote a book in 1948 .

The Macedonian government has been accused of being too lenient despite imposing laws which would allow paedophile repeat offenders to be castrated. Macedonia has adopted a bill imposing chemical castration on repeat offenders convicted of sexually abusing children. However, the country's leading child protection group says the law is still too lenient. Macedonia has adopted a bill imposing chemical castration on repeat offenders convicted of sexually abusing children . The Megjasi child protection group, which had campaigned for the procedure to be imposed on paedophiles, said today that the penalty should be mandatory for first time offenders. Lawmakers voted on Monday to make penalties harsher for convicted pedophiles increasing the maximum sentence to life imprisonment and imposing chemical castration on second-time offenders. The procedure involves regular injections that decrease the production of testosterone. The bill doesn't specify a length of time for the treatment. If imposed after an initial conviction, 'chemical castration would prevent first time offenders repeating the crime,' said Megjasi head Dragi Zmijanac. Nikola Gruevski is the Prime Minister of Macedonia which has adopted a bill imposing chemical castration on repeat offenders of sexually abusing children . Zmijanac said his organisation estimates that about 1,000 children are victims of sexual abuse and harassment in Macedonia each year, but only about a quarter to a third of those cases are reported to the police. 'Many victims do not report because perpetrators are usually their close relatives or friends,' he said. Police, however, have registered a decreasing number of cases of sexual assault against children in the country with a population of 2.1 million people. According to their figures, 90 cases were reported in 2010, 53 in 2012 and 43 cases in the first nine months of 2013 â€” the most recent figures available.The Macedonian Ministry of Labor and Social Policy said 23 people were convicted of pedophilia in 2013. Several other European countries also have legislation allowing for the chemical castration of paedophiles. In June 2012, Macedonia launched an online register of convicted pedophiles who had been released, containing their pictures, names and addresses.","Macedonia adopted a bill imposing chemical castration on repeat offenders .

Dr Jennifer Arnold, the star of TLC's The Little Couple, has revealed she has beaten cancer in a series of excited tweets. 'It's official - ME 1 vs CANCER 0... I WIN!' she wrote on Tuesday. 'Thank you for all the prayers, thoughts, & support... What a wonderful way to celebrate #WorldCancerDay! I am done with cancer!' The 39-year-old mother-of-two, who stars in the show with her husband Bill Klein, was diagnosed in October with choriocarcincoma, a cancer caused by a non-viable . pregnancy she had suffered. She underwent intensive chemotherapy treatment - and regularly updated her fans with her progress on Twitter - before announcing the great news on Tuesday. On the mend: Dr Jen Arnold, star of TLC's The Little Couple, has revealed that she is in remission after beating a rare cancer. She shared this image of her in hospital in December after starting chemo . 'I had my official last chemo treatment,' she added to People magazine. 'And while I'm hesitant to say I'm cancer-free - maybe that's common for people who have had cancer - I'm doing great. Everything is moving in the right direction. I am very excited.' Her blood count will now be monitored weekly to ensure that her cancer does not return, then after several months, she will be tested every month, and then every year. She added that she was able to get through the chemotherapy - which left her tired and nauseous - with the help of her husband and the joy of her children. 'Bill knows when I'm not doing well and he takes such good care of me,' she said. 'That was huge. 'That and enjoying watching my children play was a huge uplifting part of my treatment. With kids running around, you don't have much time to feel sorry for yourself.' Joy: She shared her good news on Twitter on Tuesday as she thanked her supporters . Winner: She will now undergo weekly blod count checks to ensure that the cancer doesn't return . Arnold will now ease back into her routine at Texas Children's Hospital, where she is a neonatologist, adding: 'I am anxious to get back to my normal self.' The reality TV star announced her diagnosis in December, shortly after she and her . husband brought their second adopted child to their home in Texas. Dr Arnold, her husband and both of their children have . dwarfism. The couple had already adopted their son, Will, from . China and they were in India to bring home their new daughter Zoey in . October when Arnold began bleeding. Desperate to stay with her daughter but feeling increasingly faint, Arnold made the difficult decision to return home. Once . back in the U.S., she was diagnosed with stage 3 choriocarcincoma, a . cancer sparked by a non-viable pregnancy she had suffered. Support: She said that her husband Bill Klein had taken great care of her throughout her treatment . Stars: The couple, pictured with their son Will, star in TLC's The Little Couple. They also have a daughter . Her . fertility issues have been well documented on the show, and she was . shocked when she became pregnant in August - although she said she was . not surprised that an ultrasound showed the baby had no heartbeat. 'I had figured it wasn't going to be viable,' she previously told People magazine. The . embryo was removed but cells were left behind and sparked the . quick-growing cancer. She began intensive chemotherapy while her husband . was still in India. But the . mass in her uterus failed to respond to the chemo and grew four times . its size - and then three tumors appeared in her lungs. Arnold, who has been wearing a wig, detailed the terrifying moment that she learned something was wrong in an interview with  People magazine. New look: The neonatologist and mother-of-two decided to wear a wig for much of her treatment . Grateful: Arnold posted this photo to her Twitter account thanking her mother, right, for her support . 'There . are moments I feel just terrible,' she told the publication. 'I can't . believe it is happening. Other times, I feel like this is just a bump in . the road.' Doctors were forced to give her a hysterectomy - which they saw as their last resort because of her small airway. An initial setback came when her . chemotherapy was postponed for a week because of low blood counts, . but said the 'silver lining' was that she was able to have 'a better . Xmas' with her family. Throughout her treatment, she shared images with her followers on Twitter - uploading adorable images of her son Will, as well as photos of her in the hospital. She also uploaded a photograph of her mother to thank her for her support. 'My parents have been a great support during this challenging time! Love them!' she wrote as her lookalike mother posed beside her in the hospital bed.","The 39-year-old was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer of the uterus after bleeding during a trip to adopt her daughter in India .

A car-lover forced to sell his beloved Porsche for money to raise funds for a start-up company 25 years ago has been given it back as a surprise retirement present from his business partner. Businessman Dave Amos, now 65, used the £8,500 from the sale of his treasured sports car to launch his business, which is now worth millions. But when Mr Amos announced his retirement, his business partner Bill Duke secretly flew 6,000 miles to track down the silver silver Porsche 911SC so he could give it back to his friend. Reunited: Bill Duke (left) flew to the UK to track down the Porsche that his friend Dave Amos (centre) sold 25 years ago to fund their new business. After finding the car in Kent, with the help of Mr Amos's nephew Richard, he was able to return the beloved motor vehicle . Mr Duke flew from his home in Texas to Britain, putting his amateur sleuthing skills to the test and within a week found the car in Kent, where it had been sold by Mr Amos in the 1980s. After buying the car, Mr Duke then had the car driven to Pembrokeshire, west Wales, where Mr Amos was celebrating his 65th birthday at home with his family. During the party Mr Duke took him outside where the gleaming Porsche was sitting in the drive. 'It was just one of those amazing moments - I could see a Porsche and thought one of my family had arrived in it,' said Mr Amos. 'Then I thought: ""It looks a bit like my old one"" - but even then I didn't realise what was going on. Pride and joy: Dave Amos washing the Porsche back in 1986, before he sold it for £8,500 to launch his business . 'But I saw the registration number and realised it was my old car. 'I couldn't believe it when Bill handed me the keys - the last time I saw it was over 25 years ago. 'Bill had bought the car in Kent and my nephew Richard drove it down to Wales for my 65th birthday. I was completely bowled over.' Engineer Mr Amos met Mr Duke when they worked together in Bahrain, using poorly designed scanning equipment to test for cracks in gas storage tanks. In Mr Duke's native Texas the two friends designed a better machine to carry out the work but didn't have the cash to put it into production. Father-of-one Mr Amos, who moved back to the UK on his retirement, said: 'Bill had four young children so it was a struggle for him and I didn't have any capital. 'But I did have the Porsche back home in Wales so I reluctantly decided to sell it. 'We used the cash from the car to build our first scanning machine and we never looked back from there.' The successful US-based company, MFE Enterprises Incorporated, is now one of the world’s leading manufacturers of magnetic flux leakage tank floor scanners and is worth millions of pounds, selling inspection tools for storage tanks and pipelines across the world. Wrench: Mr Amos reluctantly decided to sell his car, despite it being his pride and joy . Capital: The pair used the money from the sale of the car to build their first scanning machine. Their company, MFE Enterprises, is now worth millions of pounds . The three-litre Porsche 911SC , first made in 1978, is a design classic and Mr Amos's was in the colours of the Martini racing team. Mr Amos said: 'It was my pride and joy, I'd always wanted one but I had to do the sensible thing and sell it. 'It got our business off the ground and we were very successful. 'I was lucky enough to have a couple of Porsches while I was living in the States. 'But I often wondered what happened to my first one - it was a bit special.' Gift: Mr Amos is thrilled to have been reunited with his car . Working order: The Porsche's engine . On the road: Mr Amos with his precious Porsche . Mr Amos sold his half of MFE Enterprises Incorporated last year to Mr Duke, whose four children now work in the family firm based in Austin, Texas. When Mr Amos turned 65, Mr Duke flew over, and with a little help from Mr Amos's wife Sandra, managed to track the car down. Mr Amos said: 'Apparently the owner didn't want to sell - he'd spent a lot of money on the car bringing it up to tip top condition. 'But Bill made him an offer he couldn't refuse. 'I think he felt he owed me for the sacrifice I had made 30 years ago and the Porsche was payback. 'But I never saw it that way - he's like a brother to me. He owed me nothing.' Good as new: Inside the sports car, which was found in Kent and then driven to Mr Amos's home in Pembrokeshire . Branding: The last owner had spent hundreds of pounds bringing the car back up to tip top condition . Mr Duke, who was back in Texas today, said: 'It took a while but with the help of Dave's wife Sandra and his nephew Richard we found the Porsche after all those years. 'The problem was that the owner was in love with it, he had spent a lot of money on the car and didn't want to sell. 'But I sent him an email explaining the history of the car and what it meant to Dave. 'I must have touched a nerve because he emailed me back saying he was really moved by the story and he didn't feel as if the car was his any more. So we did a deal. 'Giving it back to Dave was one of the best feelings in my life - and he was gobsmacked as you say over there. 'In fact he actually sobbed and he's not an emotional guy. 'But it was my way of saying thank you for everything he did for me and my family - he is the nicest guy I've ever met.'","Dave Amos, now 65, sold his car for £8,500 to start up his business .

Eight Los Angeles police officers . violated department policy when they mistakenly riddled a pickup truck . with bullets, injuring two women, during a manhunt last year for . cop-turned-killer Christopher Dorner, a civilian oversight board . announced Tuesday. Police . Chief Charlie Beck and Alex Bustamante, inspector general for the Los . Angeles Police Commission, independently recommended that the shooting . be ruled out of policy, commission President Steve Soboroff said. He did . not provide further details. Beck . will decide disciplinary measures for the officers, who were assigned . to non-field duties during an LAPD investigation. Possible measures . could include extensive retraining, suspensions or even firings. Out of policy: Police Chief Charlie Beck will determine how to best punish the eight officers the panel found to be out of policy . At . a news conference, Beck said he couldn't comment on what discipline the . officers may receive because their information is private under state . law. He said 'these officers will all and have all received extensive . training as had the whole Los Angeles Police Department relative to . these types of issues.' Los . Angeles Police Protective League spokesman Eric Rose said the union's . president, Tyler Izen, was waiting to review the commission's report . before providing comment. Last . year, the city paid the women $4.2 million to settle a claim. That was . in addition to a separate $40,000 settlement for the loss of their . truck. The Police Commission's determination didn't surprise the women's attorney, Glen Jonas. Deal reached: The city of Los Angeles has agreed to pay Margie Carranza (left) and her mother, Emma Hernandez (right), $4.2million after the women were shot in February during a manhunt for Chris Dorner . Mistaken identity: LAPD officers fired at least 100 rounds at the delivery women's Toyota Tacoma without warning after mistaking it for Dorner's pickup . 'There . (are) 4.2 million reasons I have to believe it's out of policy,' he . said. 'Anyone with any common sense would agree it's out of policy.' Dorner, . a fired Los Angeles police officer, claimed he was unfairly dismissed . and vowed revenge against law enforcement officers in a rambling online . manifesto. He killed . the daughter of a former LAPD police official along with her fiance and . two law enforcement officers over 10 days before being cornered and . killing himself in a burning mountain cabin in San Bernardino County. On . Feb. 7, 2013, Los Angeles police guarding the Torrance home of a . high-profile target named in Dorner's manifesto opened fire on a pickup . truck they thought was Dorner's. Compromise: Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich, right, stands with Glen Jonas, attorney for the two injured women, during a news conference to announce a city settlement with Margie Carranza and Emma Hernandez . V for victory: Glen Jonas called the settlement amount fair and said it possibly spared the city as much as $15million . It actually contained the two women delivering newspapers. 'This was a tragic cascade of circumstances that led to an inaccurate conclusion by the officers,' the police chief said. The . officers had earlier learned that the target's wife recently had seen . Dorner in the neighborhood appearing to case the location, and just . prior to the shooting officers heard over police radio that Dorner was . getting off the freeway nearby, Beck said. In the early morning hours, . officers said they saw the blue Toyota pickup 'creeping' down the road, . according to the chief's report, with its high beams and flashers on. In . his report to the commission, the chief said he expected that officers . 'make every effort that they determine that the truck was in fact . Dorner's.' Rogue cop: Former police officer Christopher Dorner died in February from what was believed to be a self-inflicted wound after a nine-day manhunt . He wrote, . 'While there were similarities, the truck that approached was a . different make and model, different color, had no ski racks and no . over-sized tires.' Beck . said officers opened fire immediately after one woman threw a newspaper . and an officer mistook the sound of it hitting the pavement for . gunfire. 'There is no . evidence to support that they were holding an object that could be . reasonably perceived to be an imminent deadly threat,' Beck wrote in his . report. He said an officer with similar training and experience would . not reasonably perceive a deadly threat in the same situation. 'I . sympathize with the officers, but I have a very high standard for the . application of deadly force, and the shooting did not meet that . standard,' he said Tuesday. The mother and daughter had reached a separate deal for $40,000 to replace their ruined Toyota Tacoma . Officers fired 103 rounds, and up to 40 of the shots hit the walls, windows and garages of nearby homes, Jonas said. Emma . Hernandez, who was 71 at the time, was shot in the back, and her . daughter, Margie Carranza, then 47, suffered minor injuries. Hernandez . recovered except for some slight shoulder problems but neither woman . returned to work, Jonas said, adding that Carranza tried but 'it was too . traumatic for her.' 'The emotional and mental trauma is still there and they're still dealing with that,' he said. The . shooting occurred hours after Dorner opened fire with an assault rifle . on two Los Angeles police officers who had stopped his pickup in the . Riverside County city of Corona. During . the resulting gun battle, one officer was grazed and the other was . sprayed with shattered glass. Donner fled and a short time later shot . two Riverside police officers, killing one. 'Both . of these incidents were tragic for all involved, the officers who were . injured in the first incident and the innocent women injured in the . incident in the City of Torrance,' Soboroff said in a statement. 'As in . all use of force incidents, the department has completed a thorough . review and will adopt the lessons learned, both good and bad from these . incidents.' Soboroff . said the Police Commission followed Beck's recommendation that the . lethal use of force in Torrance was out of policy, making its . determination after nearly three hours of discussion and months of . investigation by the Police Department. The . same day that the women's pickup was shot up in Torrance, a police . officer in that Los Angeles suburb opened fire on another pickup truck. Torrance . police Officer Brian McGee believed Dorner was in the truck when he . rammed it and opened fire, according to Los Angeles County prosecutors . who determined that his use of force was reasonable and declined to file . criminal charges. McGee has not been disciplined by his agency. David . Perdue, of Redondo Beach, who was on his way to surf, wasn't shot but . he suffered head and spinal injuries.

"By . Tom Kelly . PUBLISHED: . 11:43 EST, 14 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:38 EST, 15 January 2014 . The diary of 'gifted' ballerina Tallulah Wilson, who threw herself in front of a train, has been described by police as 'dark and sad' A ‘beautiful’ teenage ballerina repeatedly scrawled ‘fat’, ‘ugly’ and ‘worthless’ in her diary before throwing herself in front of a train, an inquest heard yesterday. Tallulah Wilson’s obsession with her appearance – and her mistaken belief that she was overweight – was fuelled through people she met on social networking websites, a jury was told. The coroner described two sides to the 15-year-old – one a ‘confident, lively, engaged, lovely looking girl’ who was a gifted dancer, the other a troubled teenager who suffered from self-loathing and was wrongly convinced she was ‘extremely unattractive.’ She wrote dozens of messages about her depression and posted images of her self-inflicted injuries on photo-sharing website Tumblr, where internet users encouraged her to harm herself and share images of it, the inquest heard. Tallulah, who lived with her family in a £1million house in West Hampstead, North London, was found dead at St Pancras station in October 2012, a few hours after her mother saw her off to a dance class. DS Adrian Naylor of the British Transport Police, who investigated the death, said that diaries found at her home showed ‘disturbing writing relating to self-loathing and self-harm’.  ‘It is pretty dark, pretty sad and pretty bleak,’ he said. ‘She had written “I am fat” repeatedly, over and over again’. On one page she wrote in large black-inked letters, ‘ugly’. Another page said, ‘what am I? You are nothing’ and repeated the word ‘worthless’. The court has heard that Tallulah had become so obsessed by the internet that she had created a fantasy cocaine-taking character in order to escape reality. The teenager moved from St Marylebone School in St Pancras (pictured) after suffering at the hands of bullies . The teenager had gained 18,000 . followers on sites such as Twitter and Tumblr after posting about . drinking and taking cocaine, and uploading pictures of herself with cuts . she had made. She regularly posted messages such as ‘I will never be . beautiful and skinny’. DS Naylor said there were a number of issues rather than one ‘specific trigger’ that may have led to her death. He said: ‘It could be a combination of . what appears to be relationship breakdowns with people on the internet, . concern about self-appearance and basically engaging with like-minded . people who seem to feed that obsession. It appeared from the diary that . Tallulah sadly had very low self-esteem.’ Mary . Hassell, senior coroner for inner London north, told the jury a . photograph of Tallullah showed her to be a ‘very beautiful, lovely . looking young woman’. Her . dance teacher, Peter Laycock, told the inquest that Tallulah was his . most confident pupil and a talented ballerina when she began her dance . GCSE course in January 2012. Tallulah moved to £11,000-a-year St Margaret's School in Hampstead (pictured) a month before her death . ‘She began as very outgoing and well-liked, she was the leader of the group’, he said. ‘Because . Tallulah was naturally very gifted at dance she also had a brilliant . sense of humour and in many ways she was the most able member of the . group.’ He said she did . appear to lose some of her ‘spark’ later in the year but appeared to . have improved again, producing some ‘brilliant work’ just a week before . her death. The inquest heard . she had been bullied at St Marylebone school in St Pancras, which she . attended until summer of 2012 when she moved to St Margaret’s School in . Hampstead. A teacher responsible for pupil welfare at St Marylebone said Tallulah never complained to staff about being bullied. Lindsay . Ancock said: ‘If she was, she certainly never used the word, and we . were not aware of it. ‘It was always her mother who used the word . “bullied”.’ The inquest continues.

Thanks to an exhibition at a London gallery, beautiful vintage photos from space have been unearthed for all of mankind to observe. The show, named 'For all Mankind', at the Breese Little Gallery is a collection of over 100 images from Nasa's stellar past from the 1960's up until the 1980s. The images are nostalgic imprints from the Gemini missions, the Mars Vikings, the Jupiter Voyager and other groundbreaking moments of space exploration, reports the Huffington Post. The images display rocket liftoffs, surreal close-ups of planets within our solar system, and even mind-blowing photos of Earth from thousands of miles away. 'The exploration of space is undoubtedly one of the single most important endeavors in humanity’s quest for self-knowledge' says Breese Little. The exhibit comes at a time when space tourism is possible after Virgin CEO Richard Branson pioneered Virgin Galactic and people have already begun serving seats on the tourist space carrier. 'The ennobling rhetoric employed by JFK to launch the American space program has been superseded by a new reality', says little. The photos taken by man, woman, and machine will be on display until February 22 of 2014-one of them is the first Earthrise ever to be witnessed by human eyes.

Nigella Lawson’s dream of cracking America was put on hold because Charles Saatchi stopped her being away from home for too long, a court heard today. The celebrity chef was ‘unhappy’ in her marriage and ‘on many, many occasions’ was stopped from going out by her millionaire art mogul husband, her former personal assistant Francesca Grillo said. Miss Lawson, 53 - whose U.S. TV show The Taste is set for a second series next month - has accused 35-year-old Francesca and her sister Elisabetta Grillo, 41, of swindling her out of £685,000.

The Taste: Miss Lawson's dream of cracking America was put on hold because of Mr Saatchi, the court heard . Francesca told Isleworth Crown Court: ‘Before she started her new show… she had another offer - but she always put them off because Charles didn’t like the idea of her being away for that long.’ Her barrister Karina Arden asked her: ‘Was she happy as far as you can tell?’ Francesca replied: ‘I think in general no, her relationship, no.’ The defendant continued: ‘She is a very sociable woman. ‘She is a people person and Charles is quite the opposite. So on many, many occasions she had to turn down things or not go out because Charles wouldn’t approve.’ Asked what she spoke to Miss Lawson about, Francesca said: ‘About the children, and worries about how the children were growing up, her job, her desire to break America - the American market - her relationship with Charles and how the house was running, about the other PAs.’ Evidence: Francesca Grillo (pictured giving evidence in court today) also told jurors that Mr Saatchi would dispatch her to buy up copies of his book online .

If jumping off the earth's largest mountain - 29,035 feet above sea level - isn't scary enough, imagine doing it with the world watching. A 30-year-old California man has not only agreed to make the first wing suit flight off the summit of Mount Everest, but is letting the Discovery Channel broadcast the event live. Fortunately, Joby Ogwyn knows the ascent very well. At 24 he became the youngest American to make it to the top. Then in 2008 he set the world record for the fastest climb of Mt. Everest, making it from the base of the south side route to the summit in just nine and a half hours, when it typically takes three or four days. Joby Ogwyn, 30, from California, will endure months of training all over the world before jumping from the Himalayan mountain in a live TV event in May . In 2008 Ogwyn set a world record for making the fastest ascent up Mount Everest. He managed the climb in just over nine hours, while it usually takes three to four days . Ogwyn said he feels that ever extreme sport he has ever done has been preparing him for the jump . 'This will be the final piece of my dream,' he said. 'Ever since I was a kid, I’ve imagined what it would be like to fly. 'I can’t think of a more spectacular backdrop than Everest. 'Everything that I’ve ever accomplished in my life has just been practice for what I’m about to do.' Ogwyn's custom-made wingsuit will be equipped with cameras to film him descending than 10,000 vertical feet at speeds of over 150 mph. He will conduct dozens of test jumps in California, Florida, Utah and the Swiss Alps. After extensive preparation, he will then travel to the Himalayas for final training. After six weeks of acclimatization, Ogwyn and his team will be ready to summit Everest. Ogwyn will wear a special suit that, along with oxygen, will be fitted with cameras that will film his jump and broadcast it live . Joby Ogwyn is an experienced wingsuiter, but jumping from Everest is not exactly an average jump . The jump is set to take place in May and will be seen in 224 countries and territories. 'This is history in the making,' said Eileen O’Neill, Group President Discovery and TLC Networks. 'Discovery Channel continues to bring live broadcast events unlike anything you’ll see on television.' In October 2012, Discovery aired the space jump of Austrian extreme-sport athlete Felix Baumgartner. 'This will be the final piece of my dream,' Joby Ogwyn said the upcoming Everest jump . The 120,000 feet marked the highest altitude jump since a record set more than 52 years ago. Space Jump Live was the highest-rated, non-primetime program in Discovery Channel’s history, averaging 4.21 million viewers and reaching 7.6 million.","Joby Ogwyn, 30, of California, will become the first person to wing suit jump off Mount Everest in May .

The story of Bonnie and Clyde has been told so often, most famously in the 1967 film starring Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty; creating an original story based on the couple is seems almost impossible. And yet, a new mini-series charting the lives of the gun-toting pair not only breathes new life into their legacy, it also demonstrates that the pair have as much appeal now as they did in their own lifetimes. As rising British star, Holliday Grainger, who plays Bonnie in the new series, remarks, 'It’s one of those stories that has so many layers of intrigue to it. It’s just endlessly fascinating.' Outlaws: Holliday Granger plays Bonnie and Emile Hirsch plays Clyde in the new mini-series based on the pair . Killers: The real Bonnie and Clyde photographed in 1933. They died the following year . So who were the famous outlaws? Most agree that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were two gangsters who criss-crossed their way around 30s America, looting banks and embarking on a two-year killing spree that resulted in the deaths of at least 13 people, including seven police officers. Had they been imprisoned for their crimes their fame might not have spread, but instead they died in a hail of police gunfire – Bonnie was just 23 and Clyde 25 – thus cementing their fame for good. Countless books, songs and even musicals have immortalised the couple’s crimes, but it’s the Arthur Penn-directed film, which saw both Dunaway and Beatty earn Oscar nominations, that the new series will be compared to. 'Well,' says Grainger, 'I can’t ever live up to Faye Dunaway! But our script seems quite different. We have four hours to tell a story, so we really get to know the characters, their motivations and the reasons for their actions, which stem from their childhoods. It’s just very different.’ The mini-series, which also stars Emile Hirsch as Clyde, is indeed very different – the most notable difference coming from Grainger’s portrayal of Bonnie Parker, dubbed The Cigar-Smoking Gun Moll at the height of the couple’s fame. While Dunaway exuded a worldly sexuality in her portrayal of Bonnie, 25-year-old Grainger (whose previous roles include Estella in the 2012 film adaptation of Dickens’ Great Expectations) plays her at times with a wide-eyed innocence, which somehow makes Bonnie’s crimes seem even more horrifying. During her research for the role, Grainger read Bonnie’s letters and diaries and admits that, ‘While in the script she’s sassy and confident, in her diary she comes across as a lost little girl who just needed to be loved. Looks familiar? Granger and Hirsch recreate the famous photo of Bonnie and Clyde (above) for the show . Iconic: A scene from the 1978 film Bonnie and Clyde, showing Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty . Memorable: According to Granger, Bonnie and Clyde continue to fascinate . As a child she would cry for her mother whenever the pair were separated, and even when she married at 15 – to small-time criminal Roy Thornton – her mother ended up moving in with them. 'She was terrified of thunderstorms and didn’t like insects, so I liked the idea of this little girl who needed love and recognition. That was why she sought fame so much.’ The latest version tells the tale as a contemporary fable about Bonnie’s desire for recognition. In one scene she reads a newspaper account of one of the couple’s heists and frets endlessly about the unflattering photo of her, rather than about the shopkeeper they’ve just killed in cold blood. ‘Bonnie’s almost like a reality TV star in the way she wanted to be up there on the screen,’ says Grainger. ‘The real Bonnie was an aspiring actress but never made it. Back then in cinemas they used to show newsreels of Chicago gangsters before they played the movies. 'That was the reality TV of the time, and for Bonnie the next best thing to being a glamorous actress was a life of crime. Today it would be Big Brother.’ Born in Texas in 1910, Bonnie Parker was just four when her father died and her mother Emma, played by Holly Hunter, raised her and her two siblings alone. But if her upbringing was poor, Clyde Barrow’s was even bleaker. Living in the slums of Dallas, Clyde began his life as a petty criminal, stealing turkeys before progressing to holding up stores. By the time he met Bonnie at a party in 1930, he had already had great experience of a life outside the law, yet because he had nice clothes ‘and fancy cars’ as she told friends later, she wasn’t too concerned with his criminal tendencies. As she wrote in her diary, she wasn’t ‘going to sit back and let the world sweep by’. The couple fell in love, in spite of her marriage, but within months Clyde was in jail. Rampage: The pair conducted a two-year crime spree with the help of the Barrow gang before their deaths . Gruesome: Clyde's jacket after the 1934 shootout that left the couple dead but immortalised their story . When he got out he resolved never again to go back to prison and hit the road, taking Bonnie with him. Over the next two years the couple rampaged their way across America’s south-central states as part of the Barrow Gang – a group which also included Clyde’s older brother Buck and Buck’s wife Blanche – and the public became increasingly enthralled by their exploits. When a roll of camera film was discovered by police in one of the couple’s abandoned hideouts, it featured a shot of Bonnie smoking a cigar, a gun nestling against her hip – the 30s version of the ‘selfie’. The image scandalised and titillated the public in equal measure, and saw Bonnie feature not only on the covers of true-crime magazines, but also more glamorous publications. The fame she’d craved was hers at last. Their spree ended when Clyde and Henry Methvin, another member of the Barrow Gang, murdered two highway patrolmen in Southlake, Texas on 1 April 1934. Even though Methvin later admitted the killings, his father alerted police to the whereabouts of Bonnie and Clyde in exchange for leniency towards his son. Sticky end: This photo shows the car in which the pair died. Both were hit by more than 50 rounds each . The couple were lured onto a deserted road outside Gibsland, Louisiana, and on 23 May 1934, they came to a bloody end after being ambushed by six officers. They were shot more than 50 times without firing a round in return. Some may criticise the continued glamourisation of the pair, but, says Grainger, 'Bonnie and Clyde were glamourising crime themselves – Bonnie would be on the run with her furs and heels. 'But the ending is such an intensely gruesome and definite ending that it diminishes any glamour.' She adds: 'Bonnie was incredibly single-minded in her need for recognition and she trampled on everyone to get that. But there’s a lot of vulnerability to her as well, so the juxtaposing of those two elements was interesting. 'The tale of Bonnie and Clyde has a Romeo and Juliet love story, it’s got rebellion, it’s got everything. It’s a story that people never seem to tire of watching.’ Bonnie And Clyde starts at 9pm on Thursday 6 February on Lifetime (Sky 156 & Virgin 242)","New drama investigates the childhoods of the outlaw pair .

Charge: Michael Douglas McDowell has been charged with 10 years probation after falsifying a military record and being married to two women at once . A man who claimed touted his Purple Heart and wore military medals has plead guilty to impersonating a public servant. Michael Douglas McDowell, 57, spent years living in Fort Worth, Texas pretending to be a general but he has now been sentenced to five years’ probation for the crime. That wasn't the only deception that he is now in legal trouble for, as he has been charged with bigamy because he married one woman while still legally married to his estranged wife. The bigamy charge led to a second five-years of probation. 'For the better part of 15 years, this defendant perfected the art of stolen valor,' Tarrant County assistant district attorney Joshua Ross said in a statement. 'The lengths to which he was willing to go were prolific; including wearing an officer’s uniform and medals, as well as obtaining purple heart license plates, none of which was earned. He even wore a uniform to his marriage to a woman who believed him to be a military officer, and who was not aware of his other marriage. 'Considering those in uniform rarely ask for anything more than an occasional ‘thank you,’ Michael McDowell’s actions are profoundly offensive.' According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the first tip off to his fictitious personal history came when he offered the local police chief a tour of the White House or Pentagon. Falsified: Police have released photos of all of the fake documents that he used as props . Fooled: McDowell wrote a fake obituary for his father, that General David Petraeus commented on in 2011 . Officer Halstead told the paper that he became suspicious because McDowell reeked of cigarette smoke and was wearing an ill-fitting suit- two things that he thought were not befitting of such a high-ranking military man- prompting him to have some of his deputies look into his background. During the investigation, they were led to a fake online obituary for his father, who he claimed was a Brigadier General at the time of his death but had in fact died more than two decades earlier never having served in the military. The ruse got passed General David Petraeus- before resigning as CIA director amid extramarital affair allegations- who posted a message on the online obituary. Michael McDowell had completely fabricated not only his own military service record, but also his father's who died in 1985 in California and not in 2011 in Seattle as he wrote online. Trickery: McDowell married his second wife wearing the fake uniform (left) and was arrested in 2013 (right) That didn't stop Petraeus from offering his condolences to Michael and his then-fiancée Christy. 'General McDowell was a great man and leader, and I am confident that you will accomplish even more than he did in his lifetime,' Petraeus wrote of the deceased. 'Thank you for your devout and faithful service to your country and for being a great man that leads by example.'","Michael McDowell, 57, claimed for years that he was a General who had earned a Purple Heart for bravery .

Phil Robertson's anti-gay remarks have apparently driven away viewers as quickly as ducks fly away from shotguns as his reality show recorded its lowest viewership in the past 13 months. The only other time that Duck Dynasty has only 6.65 million viewers for an original episode- like it had last week- was back in December of 2012 when the show's second season finale pulled in their lowest numbers to date. Variety reports that in the week-to-week numbers released by Neilsen, the A&E reality show only hit a 3.3 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, and slid even lower to 2.9 in the targeted demo of more ideal viewers by advertising standards. Scroll down for video . Reinstated: Phil Robertson won't miss a day of filming after his brief hiatus was reversed by A&E . These . figures serve as just the latest batch of bad news for the show, as it . was reported earlier this week that the season 5 premiere marked a 28 . per cent drop in viewers as compared to that of season 4. At that time, they were able to draw in 12 million viewers. That . was long before Robertson landed the family- and his show- in trouble . following an interview with GQ magazine wherein he labeled homosexuality . a sin and also offended African-Americans. The remarks saw A&E initially suspend the star before an intense backlash by fans forced the network to reverse its decision and reinstate him. The episodes, like almost all of the season, had already been shot when the contentious article hit newsstands. Earlier this month, it emerged Robertson was plotting revenge on the TV network behind his hit show and reportedly has a plan in the works to move his family - plus millions of dollars of advertising and merchandise revenue - to another broadcaster. Humiliated by A&E's attempt to silence his conservative religious message, Robertson - whose Duck Commander business is worth an estimated $15 million - is secretly plotting to form his own TV production company so he can jump ship to a Christian channel more in keeping with his views. The Robertson clan are worth an estimated $15 million based of the back of the Duck Commander that Phil launched back in the 1970's . The Robertson clan have teamed up with Mossberg to create nine different shotguns, as well as two semiautomatic rifles and a semiautomatic pistol . Robertson, 67, recently served a . short suspension from the hit show after his homophobic and racially . insensitive comments but a massive outpouring of support from Conservative supporters including Sarah Palin convinced A&E to take Robertson back or risk . losing their most important cash cow. The . public support for the comments have convinced the wily businessman . that he and his family could be better served elsewhere on a network . more understanding of his views â€“ such as overtly religious TV networks . Trinity Broadcast Corporation and Christian Television Network. He is also reported to be unhappy at how A&E has portrayed the extremely wealthy Robertson clan as ignorant hillbillies. 'A&E messed with the wrong redneck,' a source close to the show told the National Enquirer. 'Phil has agreed to return, but heâ€™s already working on getting out their contracts.' Back in August the Robertson clan signed a new contract with A&E for $200,000 per episode. That contract is supposed to keep the family tied to the network for several more seasons, but Robertson is confident that he can get them out of it on a technicality after the forthcoming fifth season ends. 'He's confident lawyers can find a loophole and get them out of any long-term commitments,' said the source. 'Phil . wants to use his company name Duck Commander as the title for an . entirely new show that they can produce themselves and be in control of . what goes on.' Robertson founded Duck Commander back in the 70's, selling duck calls that developed a loyal following among hunters. Now that the family are stars in a top-rated cable-TV series, their business has expanded to sell a vast array of backwoods-themed merchandise via a number of national retailers. Shoppers at Cabela's, Wal-Mart and . Target can find Duck Commander branded items including DVDs, $15 action . figures, $50 camouflage bedding sets, video games, throw rugs, a . cookbook, coolers, T-shirts, caps, hoodies, underwear and, of course, . the duck calls that started it all. The businessman is set to capitalize even further on his huge . popularity with conservatives with the launch of his own line of Duck . Commander guns, reported CNN Money. The Robertson clan have teamed up with Mossberg to create nine different shotguns, as well as two semiautomatic rifles and a semiautomatic pistol. The shotguns come in a 'waterfowl pattern' camouflage design and Mossberg has already begun shipping them to distributors. Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the ""Duck Dynasty"" TV series, center, leaves the White's Ferry Road Church of Christ in West Monroe, La. on Sunday, Dec. 22, 2013. Robertson was suspended in early December for homophobic comments . The family features prominently in a series of ads for the new guns on Mossberg's website. In one of the videos Phil says: 'Do you know what makes me happy ladies and gentlemen? To blow a mallard drake's head smooth off.' Not all of the weapons are intended for duck hunting. The pistol and one of the rifles have military-style designs with large capacity magazines holding at least 25 rounds. The rifle has some of the features of an assault rifle, but with a relatively low .22 caliber. On its website Mossberg says the .22-caliber pistol is 'perfect for small game, plinking, target shooting - or clearing cottonmouths out of your duck blind.' All the firearms come with an American flag bandana 'like the one worn by Willie,' one of Robertson's sons. In an earlier statement to FoxNews, the Robertson family said they were 'excited to keep making . a quality TV show for our dedicated fans, who have showed us wonderful . support. 'We will . continue to represent our faith and values in a positive way through . Duck Dynasty and our many projects that we are currently working on.' Stardom: Two of the unlikely reality TV stars of Duck Dynasty, brothers Silas 'Uncle Si' Robertson (left) and Phil Robertson . A&E initially took action after Robertson's comments caused uproar, saying his views were 'disappointing' and that A&E has always been 'strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.' Now, the network says the family has made it clear that they are sorry if they caused any offense with the patriarch's remarks. 'While Phil's comments made in the interview reflect his personal views based on his own beliefs, and his own personal journey, he and his family have publicly stated they regret the ""coarse language"" he used and the mis-interpretation of his core beliefs based only on the article. 'He also made it clear he would ""never incite or encourage hate."" We at A+E Networks expressed our disappointment with his statements in the article, and reiterate that they are not views we hold,' read the statement. The homophobic comments from the born-again Christian included such insights as, 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man's anus. 'That's just me. I'm just thinking: There's more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical.' He also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they're homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I'm saying?' GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a 'stain' on the network. GLAAD spokesperson Wilson Cruz told E! News: 'Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe.","New ratings report the show dropped down immediately following their highest-rated season .

Three police officers in Opa-Locka, Florida, have been suspended for allegedly giving pop star Justin Bieber an unauthorized escort from the airport just days before his DUI arrest. City spokesman David Chiverton confirmed Friday that an investigation has been launched to determine if the Opa-Locka Police Department staffers in question accompanied the hard-partying singer from his private jet to the King of Diamonds strip club in Miami Gardens Monday. 'You can have fun in Miami, but not too much fun,' Chiverton said. Scroll down for video . Was he drunk? Allegations have been made that Miami Beach police officers erroneously said that Justin Bieber's blood alcohol level was much higher than it actually was on the night of his arrest . New details: A trio of officers from Opa-Locka, Florida, have been suspended for allegedly offering Bieber, pictured here upon his release from jail Thursday, to a local strip club Monday . Police escorts from the airport are not uncommon, but they must follow procedure because they involve city vehicles, Chiverton added. Administrators had not authorized any escort for Bieber in this case. Monday night, the King of Diamonds club tweeted that Bieber ordered $75,000 in dollar bills. The club's operator later acknowledged that was an exaggeration and that the singer only stayed about an hour. Bieber and his large entourage were escorted to a closed-off section of the club. They enjoyed the dancers and ordered a large amount of bottled water, but no alcoholic beverages were sold to them, said Ricky 'Disco Rick' Taylor in a statement. 'He had a lot of fun,' Taylor said. 'We hope he returns again.' Bieber's outing to the gentlemanâ€™s club came three days before he was arrested in Miami Bbeach on suspicion of racing a rented yellow Lamborghini while intoxicated. The 19-year-old pop star is now facing possible jail time on charges of driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license. Police said they arrested a bleary-eyed Bieber with alcohol on his breath after officers saw him drag-racing before dawn Thursday on a palm-lined residential street in Miami Beach, his luxury rental traveling at nearly twice the 30mph speed limit. He was arrested along with R&B . singer Khalil Amir Sharieff, who was driving a Ferrari, after police saw . them racing just after 4am, with two other vehicles apparently being . used to block off the area. The Canadian heartthrob later admitted smoking marijuana, drinking and taking a prescription medication, police said. Meanwhile, TMZ reported . Friday that Miami Beach police officers may have lied about Bieber's . blood alcohol level, writing in his arrest report that it was much . higher than it actually was . Moonlighting: Opa-Locka officials said the officers in question were not authorized to escort the singer . Local hotspot: On Monday, Bieber was allegedly escorted by Opa-Locka police to the King of Diamonds strip joint in Miami Gardens . Legal troubles: Bieber, pictured above outside the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center Thursday, was charged with drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license . According to the gossip site's sources, the singer's blood alcohol level at the time of his arrest was only .014, while police claimed yesterday that it was .04. Legal level of intoxication in Florida is .08. However, people under the age of 21 are considered to be driving under the influence if they have a blood-alcohol content of 0.02 per cent or more - a level the 5 foot 9, 140-pound star could reach with one drink. The criminal complaint stated that on two separate occasions two different officers smelled the odor of alcohol of the singer's breath. Officials also said that Bieber failed his field sobriety test. According to the arrest report, Bieber 'had slow deliberate movements"" and appeared to be in a stupor when the officer ordered him to exit his vehicle. Bieber was arrested after repeatedly refusing to put his hands on his vehicle so the officer could pat him down to look for weapons, the report said. It says he cursed several times at the officer and demanded to know why he was being arrested. At one point, Bieber said to an officer: 'What the f--- did I do, why did you stop me?'","Three officers from Opa-Locka Police Department were suspended for escorting the singer from the airport without permission Monday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:44 EST, 24 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:53 EST, 24 January 2014 . An Arizona stockbroker convicted of killing his ex-wife was sentenced Friday to spend the rest of his life in prison for what the presiding judge said was a brutal, gruesome crime that he cannot erase from memory. Steven DeMocker, 60, was sentenced on first-degree murder and six other convictions in Yavapai County Superior Court, after a drawn out five-year investigation. Prosecutors said DeMocker bludgeoned Carol Kennedy with a golf club at the Prescott-area house the two once shared, shattering her skull, and staged the home to make it look accidental. Guilty: Steven DeMocker looks back at his daughters in the gallery after being convicted of first-degree murder in October 2013 for the bludgeoning death of his ex-wife. He was sentenced to life in jail on Friday . Prosecutors landed convictions in the case by relying heavily on circumstantial evidence. No DNA, eyewitnesses, blood, a confession or other evidence tied DeMocker directly to the crime. Prosecutors told jurors that DeMocker killed Kennedy to cash in on her life insurance policy and to avoid monthly alimony payments at a time when he was deep in debt. 'This was premeditated murder, a brutal murder, and by all appearances, the motive was money,' Judge Gary Donahoe said. DeMocker steadfastly maintains that he is innocent. He stood before Donahoe on Friday to say he loved his former wife and was incapable of violence against her. He echoed the desires of his family who spoke before him in pleading with Donahoe to have a chance to be released after 25 years. Victim: Kennedy was 53 when she was killed in July 2008. Her mother, Ruth Kennedy, was on the phone with her daughter when she heard the words 'oh, no!' 'I did not kill Carol,' DeMocker said. 'Justice for her is not accomplished by falsely accusing and then condemning the wrong man.' Kennedy was 53 when she was killed in July 2008. Her mother, Ruth Kennedy, was on the phone with her daughter when she heard the words 'oh, no!' Prosecutors said it was then that DeMocker emerged from hiding and attacked Carol Kennedy, knowing that she was alone in the house. The supposed murder weapon never was found. In a letter to Donahoe, Ruth Kennedy asked for the maximum punishment for DeMocker, calling his actions selfish and violent. 'It seems to me that anything less would not appropriately fit the consequences of his actions,' she said. For DeMocker's daughters, Katie and Charlotte, the more than five years that it took for the case to wrap up was a prolonged nightmare, they said. Appeal: Steven DeMocker's daughter Katie wipes away tears when her father was convicted in 2013. Katie and sister Charlotte said the five-year case has been a prolonged nightmare . They spoke of their mother's joyful . spirit and compassion, and of DeMocker as a father who took them on . outdoor adventures and who was their biggest fan. 'Leave him with some hope and all of us with some hope of someday being together,' Katie DeMocker told Donahoe. But Donahoe said the brutality of the crime outweighed any requests for leniency. Trial evidence included photos of the autopsy, crime scene and of Kennedy's reconstructed skull. 'The thing that I can't get by is this horrific crime scene. I saw these pictures. I'm not sure I'm ever going to be able to erase those pictures,' Donahoe said. Along with a life sentence, DeMocker was given more than 20 years in prison on six other counts with some credit for time served. None of the sentences will run concurrently. DeMocker is planning to appeal. His family vowed to support him throughout the process, saying they are as disappointed in the sentence as they were in the verdict. Protesting his innocence: 'I did not kill Carol,' DeMocker said (seen here in October 2013). 'Justice for her is not accomplished by falsely accusing and then condemning the wrong man.' DeMocker's attorneys said authorities didn't properly investigate Kennedy's death and that another man could have killed her. 'We certainly still do believe in his innocence,' DeMocker's mother, Janice, said outside the courthouse. Donahoe also ordered DeMocker to pay restitution to Kennedy's estate for money that ultimately was used to pay DeMocker's attorneys in his first trial. That trial ended abruptly in 2010 when DeMocker's defense team quit, citing a conflict of interest.","Steven DeMocker, 60, sentenced to life behind bars for killing ex-wife Carol Kennedy, five years ago .

'Totally unacceptable': France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, pictured in Luxembourg, summoned the US ambassador to the Elysee Palace to explain himself . American spies secretly listened in to 70.3 million private phone calls in France over less than one month, it emerged today. The astonishing figure gives an indication of just how easy it is for the US to monitor people’s activities across Europe and has caused outrage in France. The country's foreign minister has summoned the US ambassador 'immediately' to the Elysee Palace to explain himself and has described America's espionage activities as 'totally unacceptable'. The scale of spying by America on French individuals and companies was revealed in documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the whistleblower and former contractor at the National Security Agency (NSA). If repeated every month, more than 843.6 million calls a year would be intercepted in a country with a population of just 65 million. The report in Le Monde, co-written by Glenn Greenwald who originally revealed the NSA surveillance program, found that when certain numbers were used, the conversations were automatically recorded. Citing Snowden's leaked documents, Le . Monde says links to terrorism were not always necessary for an intercept . to take place, describing. All of the calls were hacked and taped in the period from December 10 last year to January 8 this year as part of an NSA programme called ‘US-985D’. The intercepts appeared under the codes DRTBOX and WHITEBOX, with the NSA intercepting an average 3million-7million calls each day. Communications involving selected numbers were intercepted, together with text message content. 'This sort of practice between partners that invades privacy is totally unacceptable and we have to make sure, very quickly, that this no longer happens,' French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said during a meeting in Luxembourg with his European counterparts. The country's Interior Minister Manuel Valls said the figures were ‘shocking’, and insisted that the American government would have to explain itself. Edward Snowden (3rd R), pictured receiving the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence Award, says he believes his actions were in the best interest of American citizens . Le Monde has previously reported that . France stores metadata of ‘all emails, text messages, telephone calls, . Facebook and Twitter posts’ in an underground bunker in Paris. Mr Snowdon is wanted in America on espionage and theft of government property charges after leaking top secret details of the NSA’s monitoring activities to The Guardian. He has been living in Russia since August 1 when he was granted temporary asylum there for one year and remains wanted by the US authorities. There was no immediate comment about today’s revelations from the American government. Similar programs have been revealed in . Britain and Germany. In Brazil, the revelations so angered the president . that she cancelled a state visit to Washington and publicly denounced . the U.S. for 'violation of human rights and of civil liberties'. The most recent documents cited by Le Monde, dated to April 2013, also indicated the NSA's interest in email addresses linked to Wanadoo - once part of France Telecom - and Alcatel-Lucent, the French-American telecom company. One of the documents instructed analysts to draw not only from the electronic surveillance program, but also from another initiative dubbed Upstream, which allowed surveillance on undersea communications cables. Le Monde’s report comes a day after the German news magazine Der Spiegel said the NSA ‘systematically’ eavesdropped on the Mexican government. It hacked the public email account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, which was also used by Cabinet members, according to Der Spiegel, quoting documents released by Mr Snowden. The former NSA employee said recently he believed he was was acting in the nation's best . interests by revealing information about the its surveillance dragnet . and huge collections of communications data. The latest report on US spying in France underlines the extent of the NSA's capabilities in listening and recording such vast amounts of personal data . The article in Le Monde was co-written by Glenn Greenwald, pictured, the American journalist who first published the documents leaked by Snowden . He has been blamed for threatening the national security of countries including the UK, by revealing how the US operates to combat terrorist activities. Snowden has insisted he has not taken any top secret data with him to Russia, where he remains protected until next summer, and that while in China he was able to protect the files from being intercepted by the country's intelligence systems. In a recent interview with the New York Time, he said intelligence officials in China as well as Russia could not get access to the documents he had obtained before leaving the US. Mr Snowden said he handed over all the documents he had obtained to journalists during his stay in Hong Kong, prior to flying to Moscow. He said his familiarity with China's intelligence abilities allowed him to protect the documents from Chinese spies while he was in Hong Kong. 'There's a zero per cent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents,' he said. Mr Snowden's leaks of highly classified material have resulted in numerous news stories about US surveillance activities at home and abroad and sparked debate about their legality, and the privacy implications for average Americans.","Calls by certain phone numbers were automatically recorded by the NSA .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . UPDATED: . 14:39 EST, 21 January 2014 . Three years after scientists made the astonishing discovery of a large prehistoric spider fossil in China, the same team have uncovered another. The original female fossil, found in the Daohugou beds of Inner Mongolia in 2011, was so well preserved experts claimed it was part of the Nephila species. Yet the latest discovery of a similar-sized male fossil casts serious doubt over this theory because its relative size doesn't fit the Nephila mould. In fact, the researchers were so baffled by the differences, they have proposed a new genus called Mongolarachne, to describe the creature. The fossil of a male spider, pictured, was found on the site of Daohugou in Inner Mongolia. It was discovered in the same place as a female spider fossil from 2011. Spider fossils are rare because their bodies are soft, yet this pair was found in volcanic deposits and may have been buried at the bottom of a lake . Back in 2011, the 165-million-year-old female spider was dubbed Nephila jurassica. Experts made this conclusion because the fossil is roughly the size of modern-day Nephilidae, or orb-weaver spiders - with a body . one-inch long and more than half an inch wide, and legs that stretch to . 2.5 inches. The females in this family are large, but the males are relatively small in comparison. Although the male fossil looked similar to the Nephila jurassica, it wasn't that much smaller than the female, with a 0.65-inch long body, and legs that stretch 2.29 inches. Its sex appendages, between its jaws and legs, also did not match those seen on modern-day Nephila males. It was also said to have 'spirals of hairlets' that were more feathery than those seen on orb-weavers. This led Professor Selden and his team to propose a new genus, Mongolarachne of the family Mongolarachnidae to describe the creatures. Professor Paul Selden from Kansas University was part of the research team that discovered both fossilised spiders. Spider fossils are rare because their bodies are soft, yet this pair was found in volcanic deposits and experts believe these deposits may have buried the pair at the bottom of a lake, perfectly preserving them. Back in 2011, the 165-million-year-old female spider was dubbed Nephila jurassica. The Nephila genus is also known as Golden orb-weavers. The fossil is roughly the size of the spider's modern-day descendants, with a body one-inch long and more than half an inch wide, and legs that stretch to 2.5 inches. The females in this genus are the largest web-weaving . spiders alive today, with a body length of up to 2 inches and a leg span of . 6 inches. Males are relatively small in comparison. While the male fossil looked similar to the Nephila jurassica, its size and shape suggested otherwise. Firstly, it wasn't that much smaller than the female, with a 0.65-inch long body, and legs that stretch 2.29 inches. Its sex appendages, between its jaws and legs, also did not match those seen on modern-day Nephila males. It was additionally said to have 'spirals of hairlets' that were more feathery than those seen on orb-weavers. Researchers named the female, right, Nephila jurassica because of its likeness to the Nephila species of golden orb weavers. Yet the size of the male, left, contradicts this. Researchers now believe the species more closely resemble ogre-faced spiders and have proposed a new genus called Mongolarachne . This led Professor Selden and his team to propose a new genus, Mongolarachne of the family Mongolarachnidae, to describe the creatures. According . to findings reported in the journal Naturwissenschaften, Monogolarachne . closely resemble modern-day ogre-faced spiders, of the Deinopidae . family. The . spider was dug up at a site called Daohugou in Inner Mongolia that is . filled with fossilised salamanders, small primitive mammals, insects and . water crustaceans. During the Jurassic era, the fossil bed was part of a lake in a volcanic region. The size and shape of the female led researchers to categorise it as a descendant of the golden orb weaver spider, pictured left. In this species the male is significantly smaller, yet the fossillised male was a similar size to the female, leading experts to claim they would have more closely resembled ogre-faced spiders, right .","The spider fossil was discovered in the Daohugou beds of Inner Mongolia .

Nadia Lee, dubbed the 'Pigeon lady of Pimlico' has been found guilty of flouting an Asbo banning her from feeding the birds in her exclusive neighbourhood . A pensioner nicknamed the ‘Pigeon Lady of Pimlico’ has been found guilty of flouting an ASBO banning her from feeding the birds near her home. Nadia Lee, 67, spent 25 years fattening pigeons in the exclusive London borough, much to the dismay of locals. She became renowned for scooping stricken birds up into her Gucci handbag and taking them to her £750,000 Georgian maisonette where they are rubbed in lavender in a ‘homeopathy treatment.’ But Lee was slapped with the ASBO after neighbours complained their luxury cars were being peppered with droppings and said the feed was encouraging rats. Westminster City Council took action in December 2011, banning her from feeding birds in the local area for three years. But Lee was found to have breached the order on October 14, 2012. A jury at Southwark Crown Court were unable to agree on two further alleged breaches in July 2012, which were discharged. Lee, who suffers from multiple personality disorder, was deemed unfit to plead to the charges. Adjourning sentence for reports, Judge Martin Beddoe said: ‘ASBO or no ASBO, it’s going to be a condition of her bail not to discharge any food stuff in any public place, covered by the area as identified in the existing order.’ Addressing Lee, the judge said: ‘Regressing into a different personality is one thing that has rendered you at least temporarily unfit to be tried, but the extent which you can control your behaviour is another issue. ‘I’m not satisfied there is any evidence you can’t control this behaviour and the court expects you to control it.’ Privately educated Lee, a former secretary and pilot’s daughter, appeared crestfallen as the ruling was passed. Wearing a bright blue scarf, black fleece jacket, jeans and trainers, she sat in stunned silence before being accompanied out of the court by a friend. Lee, who suffers multiple personality disorder, was given the ASBO in December 2011 by Westminster Council . Residents in Cumberland Street, Pimlico complained their luxury cars were being peppered with bird droppings, and said the food was attracting rats . When the ASBO was originally granted, Lee said she had turned into a self-styled ‘bin lady’ after her mother’s death two decades ago. Seven residents and two council officials told how they were unable to enjoy the roof terraces and gardens of their multi-million pound homes because of pigeon dirt. One neighbour, Austen Iverleigh, complained: ‘She generates squalor on an industrial scale. ‘Whenever I have spoken to her, she has been very polite and I am sure that in any other respect, she is a very nice and reasonable person. ‘The problem is the feeding of pigeons on a huge scale, which causes serious disturbance to those around her. I have seen rats in her basement.’ Lee said she catches the pigeons with a net, which she carries with her, . before taking them home. She said: 'If they are too injured, I take . them to a pigeon sanctuary. I love them and they depend on me because I . have raised them all their lives . Egyptian-born Lee told the court: ‘You cannot rescue pigeons without putting down seed and getting them all together. ‘I then catch them in a net, which I carry with me everywhere I go. ‘Then I put them in Gucci bags hanging off my Mamas & Papas pram. I take them home and take the string off their feet, rub them in lavender and treat them with homeopathy. ‘If they are too injured, I take them to a pigeon sanctuary. I love them and they depend on me because I have raised them all their lives.’ Lee, of Pimlico, will be sentenced on February 4.","Nadia Lee was banned from feeding pigeons in the street in December 2011 .

'Catastrophic injuries': Little Callum Wilson, 11 months, died of brain damage after his mother, who was jailed today, battered him at her Windsor home . A violent mother who took photos of herself and her 11-month-old son after beatings which ended in his horrific death has been jailed for life. Emma Wilson, 25, left Callum with a detached retina, an 'unsurvivable brain injury' and 11 broken bones after battering him so violently that the ceiling in the flat below shook. She tried to blame the injuries on Callum’s ‘boisterous’  two-year-old brother who she said was jealous of his sibling. Sentencing her to life with a minimum of 14 years, Judge Stephen Kramer QC said she had showed 'no emotion' throughout the five-week trial at the Old Bailey. The court heard that Callum suffered a catalogue of abuse in the weeks before his death, during which Wilson took ‘before’ and ‘after’ photographs of herself with him. The latter pictures show her grinning next to her crying son whose face shows obvious injuries. Another showed Callum moving away from a young boy wielding a pair of secateurs. The abuse culminated in a violent attack in March 2011 when neighbours heard five or six loud bangs. Judge Kramer said: 'They caused the ceiling and light fitting to shake and the neighbours said they thought “the kid was going to come through the floor'.' The next morning Wilson told an emergency operator that  Callum was 'lifeless and not doing anything'. He was taken by ambulance to Wexham Park Hospital in Slough before being transferred to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where he died three days later. He was found to have suffered severe brain damage and fractures to nine ribs, his left leg and right arm. Wilson had denied murder, blaming it on her younger son, two at the time, saying he was jealous of his brother . Killer: Wilson, pictured outside the Old Bailey on the day she was found guilty of murder by a unanimous jury . His mother had his body buried in an unmarked communal grave. Judge Kramer said  Wilson came from a loving and supportive family but was an adept liar. 'You were clearly a good mother to your other son but for some reason you rejected Callum and acted against him,' he said. 'You were responsible for his care and if looking after two children was too much for you there was a support system there in the shape of your family and health professionals. 'Callum was vulnerable and you must have been the person who caused him the injuries which in the last ten to 14 days of his life made him so miserable, which the court saw in  photographs, that for some reason you took.’ Hospital: Callum was rushed to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford but had suffered fatal brain damage . Psychiatric reports stated that . Wilson has no mental disorder or illness. Callum spent the first few . months of his life in foster care after Wilson left him in Wexham Park . Hospital when he was born in April 2010. She . kept Callum’s existence a secret for the next seven months and was . accused of killing him because she knew her partner at the time, Neil . Richardson, was not the father. Wilson denied murder and claimed she never hurt her son, adding: ‘It’s the best thing in the world being a mum.’ A tear to Callum’s top lip was caused when she tried to check his airway, she said.'","Emma Wilson, 25, hit Callum so violently her neighbour's ceiling shook .

It is the first major attack on the Egyptian capital as insurgents step up a campaign of violence following the removal of the Islamist president. Nobody claimed responsibility for the attacks, but they bore the hallmarks of Islamic extremists who have increasingly targeted police and the military since the July 3 coup against Mohammed Morsi and a fierce crackdown on his supporters led by the Muslim Brotherhood. The explosions struck as the country was on high alert ahead of the third anniversary of the January 25 start of the 2011 uprising that toppled autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak.

His daughter, Makaziwe Mandela, told the South African Broadcasting Corporation in an interview: 'Tata is still with us, strong, courageous. Even for a lack of a better word .... on his `deathbed' he is teaching us lessons; lessons in patience, in love, lessons of tolerance. 'Every moment I get with him I'm amazed. There are times where I have to pinch myself that I come from this man who is a fighter even though you can see he is struggling, but the fighting spirit is still there with him.' Mandela spent almost three months in a Pretoria hospital after being admitted in June with a recurring lung infection. The 95-year-old liberation struggle icon was discharged in September and has been receiving home-based medical attention since then. Since June the Presidency has consistently described his condition as 'critical but stable'. 'He is still with us although he is not doing well in bed,' his grandson, Ndaba Mandela, told the SABC interviewer. Last month Mr Mandela's oldest grandson, Mandla Mandela said he found him in a 'good state.' 'He is still progressing steadily but very much under a critical condition,' Mandla Mandela told reporters. Infection: Mandela was discharged from hospital, where he had been for three months, on September 1 and taken by ambulance, pictured, to his home in Johannesburg where he receives intensive care . However, . Mandela's former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela told a local . newspaper that he remains 'quite ill' and is unable to speak because of . tubes being used to clear his lungs of liquid. He is using facial expressions to communicate, Ms Madikizela-Mandela added. The . Nobel Peace Prize winner is under the care of 22 doctors. While his . pneumonia has cleared, his lungs remain sensitive, Ms Madikizela-Mandela . said, adding that it was 'difficult for him'. 'He . remains very sensitive to any germs, so he has to be kept literally . sterile. The bedroom there is like an ICU (intensive care unit) ward,' she told the Sunday Times.

'He remains quite ill, but thank God the doctors were able to pull him through from that (last) infection.' His lung problems date back to his time in jail when he was diagnosed with early stage tuberculosis. Mr . Mandela, who spent 27 years in apartheid jails before becoming South . Africa's first black leader, has faced several health scares. His most recent 86-day hospital stay was his longest since he walked free from prison in 1990. Mr Mandela has been in and out of hospital since last year with lung-related complications. A globally-admired figure for steering South Africa peacefully into democracy, Mandela's health problems prompted outpourings of well wishes around the world.","Daughter Makaziwe Mandela: 'He is still with us, strong, courageous'

The Pentagon is set to begin testing controversial surveillance blimps over Maryland that can spot a person 340 miles away. Built by defence firm Raytheon, the blimps will fly in pairs at 10,000 feet. Raytheon boasts the project can offer '360 degree 24/7 surveillance for 30 days at a time' - raising major privacy concerns over the project. Scroll down for video . The 'JLENS' blimp, built by Raytheon, which can spot objects 340 miles away using highly sensitive radio systems. The US Army is about to begin testing two of the craft over Maryland, sparking privacy fears. how they work: The blimps can 'see' for 340 miles. They are moored to base stations, and offer 360 degree surveillance capabilites. They are designed to look for cruise missiles. Reports say the Army will launch two white blimps over Maryland that are tasked with detecting low-flying cruise missiles, but privacy advocates fear they will be outfitted with cameras that can monitor people. The program will run for three years starting in October, and can detect missiles from Boston to North Carolina on the coast and as far inland as Lake Erie, according to the Washington Post. Raytheon, which makes the craft, advertises them as useful for 24/7 surveillance. 'What if there was an affordable way the U.S. and its allies could always “see” the threat, instead of having to hope they had a ship or airplane in the vicinity to detect the threat?,' it says on its website. Old-fashioned: Blimps have been around for decades, but they only recently came back into usage by the U.S. Army . The two blimps work together to identify threats such as missiles entering the nearby area. 'JLENS, an affordable elevated, persistent over-the-horizon sensor system uses a powerful integrated radar system to detect, track and target a variety of threats,' Raytheon says. Aerostats, as they are now called, are already used to protect American bases in Afghanistan and Iraq. They are outfitted with cameras and used to track insurgent and U.S. troop movements. The dirigibles famously snared Army Staff Seargent Robert Bates slaughtering 16 civilians in Kandahar in March 2012. Video showed Mr Bates returning to the base under what he thought was the cloak of early morning darkness. The footage showed him carrying the rifle used to carry out the mass murder. The blimps are also used at the U.S. – Mexico border to try to catch illegal immigrants, CBS News noted. The army has commissioned defense contractor Ratheon to provide the airships, which will hover at an altitude of about 10,000 feet over the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground, for the multi-year trial run. Only missiles: The Pentagon insists the aerostats will only be used to search for missiles, but they are already used overseas to monitor insurgent movements . Will Big Brother be watching: The ACLU is also concerned the airships will be used to watch people on the ground . Privacy advocates worry the blimps will also be equipped with high-resolution cameras and radar to track the movements of civilians. ‘Right now there are no rules,’ Christopher Calabrese, of the American Civil Liberties Union, told CBS News. ‘There's nothing that bars us from having high-powered cameras monitoring our every public movement.’ Another ACLU analyst echoed those thoughts to the Post. ‘That's the kind of massive persistent surveillance we've always been concerned about with drones,’ said Jay Stanley. ‘It's part of this trend we’ve seen since 9/11, which is the turning inward of all these surveillance technologies.’ The blimps will fly in pairs at 10,000 feet. Maker Raytheon boasts the project can offer '360 degree 24/7 surveillance for 30 days at a time' - raising major privacy concerns over the project. HIghly visible: People as far away as Baltimore will be able to see the blimps high above them . The Army insisted in a letter to the paper that the aerostats, which can fly for as long as 30 consecutive days, will be the first line of defense against incoming missiles. ‘The primary mission... is to track airborne objects. Its secondary mission is to track surface moving objects such as vehicles or boats. The capability to track surface objects does not extend to individual people.’ The government also said that there are currently no plans to put cameras capable of tracking people on the blimps, but it could not rule out doing so in the future. As it is currently constructed, the program is expected to cost $2.7billion. Civilians as far away as Baltimore will be able to see them from the ground. Only time will tell if the aerostats are looking back.","The $2.7billion program is slated to start in October and run for three years .

A former pressure group chairman and an ex-member of the BBC Trust who was involved in an expenses row were yesterday handed key roles in the Government’s Press Royal Charter. The two quangocrats – Elizabeth France and Dr Chitra Bharucha – have served on at least 17 public bodies between them. The only member of the Appointments Committee with any knowledge of the newspaper and magazine industry – former Scottish Media Group chief executive Andrew Flanagan – is a chartered accountant, not a journalist. The committee, which will appoint the chairman and members of a Recognition Panel, is headed by Dame Anne Pringle, a 35-year career civil servant and former ambassador to Moscow. Mrs France was appointed the first chairman of the UK Public Affairs Council in 2010 – a pressure group set up to represent the lobbying industry. Its intention was to dissuade the Government from setting up a statutory register of lobbyists by establishing a voluntary list of their activities. However, it was dogged by repeated ‘delays and inaccuracies’ in its work. Dr Bharucha, a former vice-chairman of the BBC Trust, was among four trustees who were heavily criticised in 2008 for spending £20,000 of licence-payers’ money to take a group of ‘opinion-formers and stakeholders’ to Wimbledon. In 2010 it was disclosed that she included a claim for £175 to cover the cost of seven months of her Sky TV subscription. The Government’s Royal Charter, was approved by the Queen at the end of October, but since then not a single newspaper or magazine has said it will sign up. In November, Culture Secretary Maria Miller told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show the Royal Charter could become redundant if the industry’s new watchdog, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, proved to be successful. Tory MP Philip Davies said the Royal Charter process was now a ‘farce’. He added: ‘I’ve no idea what qualifies these people to be world-leading authorities. In November, Culture Secretary Maria Miller told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the Royal Charter could become redundant if the industry's new watchdog proved to be successful . From the Government that was committed to abolishing quangos we have got ourselves a completely pointless quango.’ A newspaper industry source said: ‘These appointments will do very little to reassure the public or the Press that the Government’s Recognition Panel will be properly independent. 'The mindset of those involved is illustrated by the fact that each of the biographies of the new committee members issued by the Public Appointments Commissioner is helpfully labelled “unclassified”.’","Former pressure group chair and ex-member of BBC Trust involved in an expenses row handed key role in Government's Press Royal Charter .

A judge has ordered a Texas hospital to remove life support for a pregnant, brain-dead woman. Judge R. H. Wallace Jr. issued the ruling Friday in the case of Marlise Munoz. John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth has been keeping Munoz on life support against her family's wishes. Munoz was 14 weeks pregnant when her husband found her unconscious November 26, possibly due to a blood clot. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Erick found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor in late November. She'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain. She was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness . Questions: In Texas, state law stipulates that, . in cases of pregnant women, DNRs do not apply and all measures must be . taken to save the life of the fetus . Erick Munoz says he and his wife are . paramedics who were clear that they didn't want life support in this . type of situation. His attorney argued that keeping the woman alive . would set a dangerous precedent. But John Peter Smith Hospital had argued that it had to protect the life of the unborn child. Hospital officials have said they were bound by a state law prohibiting withdrawal of treatment from a pregnant patient. Several experts interviewed by The Associated Press have said the hospital is misapplying the law. The case has raised questions about end-of-life care and whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus. It also has gripped attention on both sides of the abortion debate, with anti-abortion groups arguing Munoz's fetus deserves a chance to be born. Earlier this week, Erick Munoz's attorneys said that the fetus, now believed to be at about 22 weeks' gestation, is 'distinctly abnormal.' They attorneys said they based that statement on medical records they received from the hospital. First child: Munoz with her first baby. She was pregnant with her second when she collapsed in November . The Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, which is representing the hospital in the lawsuit, said the hospital was expected to issue a statement later Friday in response to the ruling. Not much is known about fetal survival when mothers suffer brain death during pregnancy. German doctors who searched for such cases found 30 of them in nearly 30 years, according to an article published in the journal BMC Medicine in 2010. Those mothers were further along in pregnancy - 22 weeks on average - when brain death occurred than in the Texas case. Birth results were available for 19 cases. In 12, a viable child was born. Follow-up results were available for six, all of whom developed normally. Marlise . Munoz was hooked up to machines in a Fort Worth hospital as her . husband and the hospital were locked in a court battle about whether to . retain life support. Erick Munoz said his wife, a fellow paramedic, was clear with him before he found her unconscious on November 26: If she ever fell into this kind of condition, pull life support. Munoz's attorneys, Heather King and Jessica Hall Janicek, issued a statement Wednesday describing the condition of the fetus, now believed to be at about 22 weeks' gestation. King and Janicek based their statement on medical records they received from the hospital. 'According to the medical records we have been provided, the fetus is distinctly abnormal,' the attorneys said. 'Even at this early stage, the lower extremities are deformed to the extent that the gender cannot be determined.' The attorneys said the fetus also has fluid building up inside the skull and possibly has a heart problem. Normal heartbeat: Doctors previously said that the baby has a normal heartbeat and had the potential to be carried to full term . Happier times: Above, Erick Munoz holds the couple's one-year-old son Mateo. Attorneys are now saying that the fetus carried by Marlise Munoz is 'abnormal' 'Quite sadly, this information is not surprising due to the fact that the fetus, after being deprived of oxygen for an indeterminate length of time, is gestating within a dead and deteriorating body, as a horrified family looks on in absolute anguish, distress and sadness,' the attorneys said. Spokeswomen for the hospital and the Tarrant County District Attorney's office, which is representing the hospital in the lawsuit, declined to comment Wednesday. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday. Munoz's lawsuit asks a judge to order the hospital to pull life support and return Marlise Munoz's body to her family. Several experts have said the Texas Advance Directives Act doesn't apply in this case because Marlise Munoz, having suffered brain death, is legally and medically dead â€” a key argument in Erick Munoz's lawsuit. Munoz previously told the AP he wasn't confident about the health of the fetus. His wife was 14 weeks pregnant when he found her unconscious in November, possibly from a blood clot. A 2010 article in the journal BMC Medicine found 30 cases of brain-dead pregnant women over about 30 years. Of 19 reported results, the journal found 12 in which a viable child was born and had post-birth data for two years on only six of them â€” all of whom developed normally, according to the journal. I don't agree with this law': Erick said he was unable to fulfill his promise to his wife because of the Texas law, which applies to all pregnant women, even those with do not resuscitate orders . 'We knew what her wishes were': Both Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. He found her collapsed on November 26 and initiated CPR, but it was no use.

But now it can be revealed that cash-conscious Eric Pickles, who regularly warns councils they must trim their spending, cuts his own hair at home for free. Bargain barnet: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles does not splash the cash on his hair, preferring to trim what's left using clipper himself at home . While Margaret Thatcher once had 120 appointments with her stylist in a single year, all of those currently arguing about their hair cut costs seem to be men. The cost of looking like a modern . statesman seems to vary widely, from £90 for the Prime Minister to just . £13 for a Labour frontbencher. But Communities Secretary Mr Pickles, who has demanded cuts across local government in the age of austerity, settles for a DIY job.

For the chop: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg boasted of paying only £20 for his hair cut after it emerged David Cameron's regular stylist costs £90 . Facing the chop: Nick Clegg revealed he often gets his hair cut at Jam in Sheffield . It was reported that a trim from the crimper to the stars cost Mr Cameron £90-a-time, and raised questions about Carbosier's role in disguising the PM's much-rumoured bald spot. Mr Carbosiero - whose clients include . Kylie Minogue, Sir Paul McCartney and Dustin Hoffman - cuts hair at the . prestigious Daniel Galvin salon in central London. When questioned on . Sky News about the Prime Minister's apparent bald patch, Mr Carbosiero . showed laudable discretion, replied diplomatically: 'What bald spot?'

Local; cuts: Tory Cabinet minister Andrew Lansley is a regular at Mr Polito's Barber Shop in Cambridge where he is an MP . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg revealed on his LBC 97.3 radio phone-in that he had his haircut by Christian at Jam Hairdressing in Sheffield, where it cost £20. He . said: 'The last time I got my haircut was in Sheffield, in my . constituency, where haircuts are considerably cheaper than in London. 'But I do pay more when I get my hair cut in London, at a . barbers/hairdressers just off Victoria Street.' Ed Miliband does not have a regular hairdresser, sources close to the Labour leader revealed. 'He often goes to a local barbers, sometimes he has people who come into the office. He does not have a set amount which he pays for his hair,' the source added. Critics have asked why Lino Carbosiero (left), responsible for the PM's side parting (right), was given an MBE .

In response, Mr Lansley showed off his silver locks to the public gallery, before telling MPs: 'When I visit Mr Polito’s in Cambridge, as I perhaps will this weekend, he will be able to advise me. 'Mr Polito’s is not a person but a shop. Actually, it costs £15, so I am getting my hair cut cheaper than the Deputy Prime Minister, which just shows that you can come to the Conservatives for value for money.'

A record £3.1 million ($5.7 million) in cash was seized last week in Sydney by Australian police, leading to the arrest of an American man, as a part of the latest bust in their crackdown on international money laundering and drug trafficking. The millions were found spread across seven suitcases, with officers arresting an man from the U.S., 58, who had only been in the country two days. The man, who denied that the money belonged to him, was charged with dealing with the suspected proceeds of crime, and could face 3 years in jail, or up to 25 years in jail if he is also charged with money laundering. Part of the haul discovered by police in Australia. Officers found more than AUS $5.7 million stored in suitcases . Australian police are calling this one of its largest ever cash finds, after cash was found stuffed into seven separate suitcases, but it by no means the end of the Australian operation, which has been going on for 12 months . Part of the busts from an operation by Australian police to crack down on organised crime, with authorities confiscating $580 million in cash, drugs and assets so far. Pictured are several firearms and a stash of drugs . So far, the crackdown, named Operation Eligo, has netted authorities more than £307 million ($580 million) in cash, drugs and assets since its inception. The Australian Crime Commission (ACC) began the operation in an effort to crack down on major crime including money laundering, illegal drugs markets and organised crime. It is a collaboration between the ACC, AUSTRAC (Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre), and federal and state police, who have been working for 12 months to target international criminals and money launderers. It is thought there is a very complex network of criminals from 20 countries involved in moving illicit earnings from illegals activity in and out of Australia. This network is believed to include terrorist organisations, human traffickers, biker gangs and drug cartels with £16 billion ($30 billion) going through Australia every year. Almost $6 million in a suitcase, as well as several newspapers and a guidebook to Sydney. An American man has been arrested and charged with dealing with property that is thought to be the proceeds of crime . Hauls from Operation Eligo, which targets international money laundering and crime syndicates, including drugs (left) and millions of dollars in currency (right) The haul, organised and stored as evidence as part of Operation Eligo, which will be used in the upcoming trial of the arrested American . So far authorities from the ACC have siezed more than £13.7 million ($26 million) in cash and £281 million ($530 million) in drugs. There have also been 105 people arrested on 190 charges. Australian Minister for Justice, Micheal Keenan, described the results as 'extraordinary'. He said: 'Seizing more than $550 million worth of drugs and cash is a significant blow to the criminal economy. 'The international money transfer business is a legitimate industry, and one which is now better protected against serious and organised crime.' The American is understood to have arrived two days before he was arrested last weekend . The suitcase part of the haul, containing a few sundries and leisure items, but mostly money, thought to be profits from illegal activity . The haul has been taken away as evidence in a larger case, which has seen one person arrested after the seizure of the suitcases . Chief executive of the ACC Paul Jevtovic said the operation is using 'criminal intelligence insights' like those used by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to disrupt links between drug cartels, money launderers and terrorist groups. Mr Jevtovic said: 'Non-traditional law enforcement measures aimed at disrupting and deterring organised crime groups from targeting Australia have been used. 'Through these new methodologies, new areas of focus, and new and more efficient ways of investigation, we've been better able to unearth an elaborate network of criminal activity, and remove half a billion dollars from the criminal economy-profits destined to line the pockets of criminals.' Australian Federal Police Commissioner Tony Negus said Operation Eligo was having a significant impact. He said: 'These criminals are now firmly in our sight, and we will continue to target their activities to remove the incentive and reward for organised crime in this country.' So far the operation has seen seen the arrests of 105 people on 190 charged and a $20 million seizure of drugs, cash and assets by West Australian Police last week . The bust was the biggest single seizure of crime-related cash in Australian history, and comes after a series of other record busts during the operation . Chief Executive Officer of AUSTRAC, John Schmidt, said the legitimate sector has a high risk of being exploited by serious and organised crime groups. He said: 'The inherent risk of the sector - which provides an important service whereby Australians can send money anywhere in the world affordably and almost instantaneously - underlines the importance of maintaining a robust regulatory regime and continuing industry engagement and support.' United States Ambassador to Australia John Berry said: 'I’m proud that we have such strong law enforcement cooperation with Australia. Together we are disrupting the international drug trade and preventing people from profiting from crime.' By using DEA tactics, with access to their global network, combining it with their own intelligence from Commonwealth agencies, Operation Eligo has also closed down three amphetamine labs, and one of the largest urban hydroponic grow houses ever seen in Port Botany, New South Wales. Investigations are continuing.","Australian authorities have seized more than £3 million in a single haul .

She was the famous beauty who captured the heart of one of the UK's best-loved artists but unlike her contemporary, Lizzie Siddal, few remember Jane Burden today. And yet, the story of Jane Burden, later Morris, the beautiful stablehand's daughter who went on to appear in some of the world's most famous paintings, is just as fascinating. Now the tale of the model and muse, who died exactly 100 years ago, is the subject of an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, due to run until May. Muse: Jane proved irresistible to the Pre-Raphaelite painters, including Rossetti who painted this 1881 portrait . Janey Morris: A Pre-Raphaelite Muse charts her rags-to-riches journey and includes some of the incredible works of art she appeared in. Many were by her lover, husband William Morris' close friend Dante Gabriel Rossetti, whose other muse was his wife, the flame-haired Lizzie Siddal. Although Morris didn't share Siddal's tawny colouring, she did match her for beauty and frequently appeared as a goddess, whether Proserpine [Persephone] or Astarte, in Rossetti's work. Her husband, meanwhile, chose to portray her as King Arthur's famously beautiful - and famously unfaithful - Queen Guinevere in an 1858 painting that also goes by the title La Belle Iseult. Other artists to work with Morris included Edward Burne-Jones, who immortalised her likeness in a succession of stained glass windows, and Evelyn de Morgan; one of the few female Pre-Raphaelite painters. Beauty: Morris as Astarte Syriaca, the Middle Eastern deity, and in Rossetti's Day Dream (right) Family: Jane, second from right, sits between her two daughters and in front of her husband William Morris . The Pre-Raphelites were a group of English artists who formed a 'brotherhood' in 1848, dedicated to creating work that rejected the mannered approach adopted by Raphael and other Renaissance painters. Believing Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo had proven a corrupting influence on art, they wanted to return to the intense colour and detailed compositions that characterised 15th century Italian art. Founded by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the trio later welcomed Rossetti's brother, William, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to their circle. So who was Jane Morris? Like Siddal, her rival in both love and art, little is known of her childhood other than that it was poor and deprived. Born on the 19th October 1839 in Oxford, Morris was the daughter of a stableman, Robert Burden, and his laundress wife Ann Maizey. Although she was undoubtedly beautiful, she seemed destined for a life of obscurity until a chance encounter with a group of artists outside a theatre at the age of 18 changed her life forever. Edward Burne-Jones and Gabriel Dante Rossetti were in Oxford to complete work on a mural for John Ruskin, then the UK's leading art critic and the Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford University. Spotting her outside Oxford's Drury theatre, the pair were enraptured by her beauty and Morris' modelling career began. Morris, for her part, was smitten by Rossetti but he, at the time engaged to Lizzie Siddal, didn't reciprocate. Instead, she became engaged to his friend, William Morris, whom she met through Rossetti and sat for on several occasions. Lovers: Rossetti (left) and Jane, seen in a study for Astarte Syriaca, were lovers after the death of Siddal . Ethereal: Rossetti's 1850 work, The Bower Meadow, includes a depiction of Jane Morris (left) Family: Jane's long-suffering husband William Morris (left) and their younger daughter, Mary (May) The pair married in 1859 and went on to have two daughters, Jane and Mary, with whom they lived in the beautiful Kelmscott Manor on the Gloucestershire-Oxfordshire border. Despite her humble background, the new Mrs Morris had few problems fitting into upper class society, refining her accent to the point where friends described it as 'queenly' and later inspiring Vernon Lee's 1884 novel Miss Brown, which in turn inspired the musical and film, My Fair Lady. But although she and Morris appear to have been happy, Rossetti remained in the background and after Siddal's death, their affair began in earnest. The relationship would last, off and on, until his death in 1882, and she would go on to star in some of his most famous works. After his death, she embarked on an affair with poet and political activist Wilfred Scawen Blunt that endured until 1894. Later life: These photographs were taken in 1898, after she was widowed, at Kelmscott Manor . He was her last love. Just two years after her relationship with Blunt ended, her husband died and Jane, left white-haired by the trauma of nursing him through his final illness, would remain alone for the rest of her life. She would outlive her husband by 16 years, eventually dying peacefully at the age of 75 in her bed on 26th January 1914 in Bath. Muse, model and romantic, Jane's death might have been a conventional one but her life was anything but.

House Republicans are currently demanding a criminal probe for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper for his flat-out denial in March, three months before the Snowden leaks began, that the NSA was collecting data on hundreds of millions of Americans. Rice also insisted that NSA surveillance has been worth is and ‘the fact that we have not had a successful attack on our homeland since 9/11 should not be diminished.’ The National Security Advisor also insisted that she has no regrets about taking the series of Sunday show interviews that brought her career under fire in September 2012.

In recent weeks Cumberbatch has become a . familiar presence on the red carpet due to his roles in the . Oscar-nominated 12 Years A Slave and August: Osage County. International star: In recent weeks Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch has become a familiar presence on the red carpet due to his roles in the Oscar-nominated 12 Years A Slave and August: Osage County . And the ever-increasing popularity of the British star in Hollywood is not lost on Steven Moffat, an executive producer on the show Sherlock. Speaking to the Television Critics Association in California Mr Moffat revealed that he is already preparing a fourth series. The only potential problem is that Cumberbatch appears to be growing more famous in the US by the day. Sherlock executive producer Steven Moffat says Cumberbatch will continue until he 'gets too famous' The third series of Sherlock made its American debut this week to impressive audience figures. Some 4 million viewers tuned in, up 25 per cent from the previous year. On the IMDB STARmeter, a gauge of film industry interest in actors, Cumberbatch is currently ranked in fifth place. The only male actor ahead of him is Leonardo DiCaprio. Speaking alongside Moffat, the actor attributed his career trajectory, in part, to the “iconic” standing of Sherlock Holmes. Asked about the fans who had gathered to catch sight of him at a Los Angeles hotel, Cumberbatch called the experience 'kind of extraordinary and a little bit unnerving … They are so supportive, loyal and by and large intelligent, and some of them normal.' He dismissed the idea that playing a character like Sherlock could prove overwhelming. 'I'm fine with it. I’m going to keep going with it... I love it. I find it very invigorating.' His co-star, Martin Freeman, who plays Watson, has also established himself in Hollywood. He will next appear in a US television series based on Fargo, the Coen brothers’ Oscar-winning film. Freeman has admitted that he initially doubted that a remake of Fargo was wise — a reservation he also harboured when first offered a part in a new Sherlock Holmes drama.

Syrian troops have tortured children, executed them and used some as young as eight as 'human shields' during military raids against rebels, according to a UN report released today. The United Nations branded the Syrian government one of the worst offenders on its annual 'list of shame' of conflict countries where children are killed, abused and forced to fight. Human rights groups estimate that about 1,200 children have died during the 15-month uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, whose brutal crackdown on Arab Spring-inspired protests has been widely condemned. Brutal crackdown: Children join the protests against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Habeet, near Idlib, as a UN report documents shocking abuses and killings of boys and girls at the hands of the government . Demanding change: Demonstrators in Kafranbel, near Idlib hold a placard (left) that reads: 'Are you dumb? Is there any sane person who really believes there could be a peaceful solution?' 'Rarely have I seen such brutality against children as in Syria, where girls and boys are detained, tortured, executed, and used as human shields,' Radhika Coomaraswamy, UN special representative for children in armed conflict, said ahead of the report's release. Government forces rounded up dozens of boys aged eight to 13 before an attack on the village of Ayn l'Arouz in Idlib province on March 9, the report said. The children were 'used by soldiers and militia members as human shields, placing them in front of the windows of buses carrying military personnel into the raid on the village,' it said. Quoting witnesses, the UN report said Syrian military and intelligence forces, as well as pro-government Shabiha militiamen, surrounded the village for an attack that lasted more than four days. Among the 11 dead on the first day were three boys aged 15 to 17. Conflict continues: An image grab taken from a video uploaded on YouTube on Monday shows smoke billowing from the flashpoint Syrian city of Homs which activists said was being attacked by regime forces . 'Grave violations': The UN report says government forces have been using children as shields while attacking, torturing and killing residents during the 15-month crackdown on protesters . Another 34 people, including two boys aged 14 and 16 and a nine-year-old girl, were detained. 'Eventually, the village was reportedly left burned and four out of the 34 detainees were shot and burned, including the two boys aged 14 and 16 years,' the Children in Armed Conflict report said. UN chief Ban Ki-moon said the report had uncovered one of many 'grave violations' against children. The Syrian government, and its allied militias, was one of four new parties added to the UN's list of shame - along with organizations and political parties in Sudan and Yemen. The list includes 52 parties in 11 countries, ranging from the Afghan national police and the anti-US Haqqani network to the Lord's Resistance Army in central Africa, Sudanese armed forces and various Darfur rebel groups. The report said children in Syria as young as nine had been victims of killing and maiming, arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and ill treatment, including sexual violence and use as human shields. Outrage: Mourners attend a mass burial in Syria for more than 100 people, half of whom were children, killed in a massacre in the city of Houla last month . International attention: UN observers view bodies at a hospital morgue before the burial of the Houla dead . Schools have been regularly raided and used as military bases and detention centers, the report said. The report was completed before the Houla massacre on May 25, when 49 of the 108 victims were said to be children, some as young as two and three, who were shot in the head or had their skulls smashed with blunt instruments. 'Most child victims of torture described being beaten, blindfolded, subjected to stress positions, whipped with heavy electrical cables, scarred by cigarette burns and, in one recorded case, subjected to electrical shock to the genitals,' said the UN report. At least one witness told investigators he had seen a boy of approximately 15 succumb to repeated beatings. The New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the UN Security Council should impose an arms embargo and other sanctions on the Assad government over its violations against children. HRW quoted the Syria Violations Documentation Center, a network of Syrian activists, as saying that at least 1,176 children have been killed since February 2011. It also said there were 'credible allegations' that armed opposition groups, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA), are recruiting children as soldiers. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of international charity Save the Children, said: 'United Nations reports of children being used as human shields and being forced to work on the front lines are shocking and deeply worrying, and the perpetrators of these crimes must be held to account. 'This is contrary to International law, and we call on all sides to ensure that children are protected and kept safe from danger. All parties must now allow unhindered humanitarian access to help young people and their families.'","Syrian government among worst offenders on UN's 'list of shame'

Fired: Marie Margaret Sloan was found guilty of four years of misconduct and taken off the nursing register to protect the safety of elderly and vulnerable patients . A 'foul-mouthed' convent nurse has been struck off the nursing register. Marie Margaret Sloan was sacked from her post as care manager of the Sisters of Loreto's North Wales branch following a four-year spell of chaos. A Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) fitness to practise hearing heard how the Facebook-loving grandmother allowed a frail nun to be given the wrong medication for at least a week and trawled the internet for embarrassing stories about the Sisters - who she said were ‘bonkers’ and a ‘pain in the a***’ to staff. An NMC panel, which believes Ms Sloan sneaked hundreds of prescription tablets belonging to a dead nun into South Africa for her ill brother, said the registrant placed her patients at unwarranted risk time and time again. Chairwoman Christine Castledine said people would be placed in danger if the registrant was allowed to stay on the nursing register. ‘Her conduct took place over a significant period of time when she was dealing with vulnerable and elderly patients who depended upon her,’ she added. ‘Despite Ms Sloan being in a position of trust, the care of the Sisters was not her first concern.’ The Sisters of Loreto in Abbey Road, Llandudno, is a former school turned spiritual retreat and offers up to 20 residential places for elderly Sisters. Registered nurse Ms Sloan began working there in 2008 after bosses decided to create the new post of care manager. Despite impressing in interview with her ‘extensive’ nursing experience, her abilities were soon called into question. Risks: The Nursing and Midwifery Council found Ms Sloan gave a nun at the Sisters of Loreto in Wales the wrong medication for a week. She also trawled Facebook for embarrassing stories to torment them . In 2011 and 2012, inspections of the . convent were carried out by external auditors, who said they were . shocked at what they found. Carer . and cook Janet Starr, who has worked there for 16 years, told the NMC . the place was supposed to be holy and serene, but she added: ‘One of the . carers came into work drunk and I had to send her home for everyone's . safety. ‘I phoned Marie about it but her reply was, 'I can't do anything about it'.’ Inspectors . also found patient confidentiality was breached by ‘loud-mouthed’ Ms . Sloan, no staff training was provided and medication was not safely and . securely stored. A housekeeper said she often found tablets strewn over . the floor and in unlocked draws. Ms . Sloan was also accused of suddenly stopping the drug supply for a woman . referred to in the hearing as Patient A, without approval from a . doctor. When the elderly . woman died, the NMC was told how the registrant forgot to cancel the . prescription, resulting in a stockpile building up. 'Marie said the medication was too . expensive out there and her brother-in-law couldn’t afford it. I told . her that was illegal and drug-smuggling, but she didn’t seem to care.' - colleague, Janet Starr . Mrs Starr said her former boss confessed to taking ‘hundreds’ of the tablets to South Africa. ‘Marie . said the medication was too expensive out there and her brother-in-law . couldn't afford it,’ she added. ‘I told her that was illegal and . drug-smuggling, but she didn't seem to care.’ Also . in 2012, a woman referred to as Patient B was given incorrect . medication. The NMC said the gaffe, which caused ‘actual patient harm’, . was noticed when the unwell Sister noticed someone else's name on the . packaging of the tablets just before she was due to see a GP. The . doctor's appointment was cancelled but the mix-up was never recorded in . the patient's notes and only came to light when the pensioner told . another member of staff in passing about it. A three-person panel said Ms Sloan's behaviour fell well below the standards expected of a registered nurse. They . referred to an incident where Ms Sloan contacted ex-pupils of the nuns . over the internet in an attempt to find embarrassing stories about them. As . well as sharing the information she claimed to have found with staff, . she compared one of her Sisters to an internet photograph of a topless . grandmother who had had breast enhancement surgery. It . was also alleged Ms Sloan made inappropriate comments, saying the nuns . were ‘all bonkers’ and ‘I ain't f****** taking that woman again because . it's a pain in the a***’. Mrs . Starr added: ‘It was just terrible. She was supposed to be protecting . these ladies, but she didn't treat them with any respect at all.’ Action: The Facebook-loving care manager has since been fired after four years of misconduct . Despite . being given plenty of opportunity to rebuff the claims, the registrant . opted to stay away from a five-day hearing in Cardiff. After . deciding 13 allegations of misconduct proven and her fitness to . practise was impaired, the NMC said that as well as protecting patients . it had to ensure public confidence in the profession was maintained. Case . presenter Robert Clarke said: ‘Ms Sloan put the sisters at unwarranted . risk time and time again. They were vulnerable and elderly - one of the . ladies is even over the age of 100. ‘And these were not isolated incidents either. It was a disturbing and protracted period of misconduct.’ Mrs Castledine said: ‘This decision sends a clear message of the standards expected and required of nurses. ‘Ms Sloan may face some hardship as the result of the decision, but the public's interest and protection outweigh these.’ Ms Sloan has 28 days to appeal against the decision.","Marie Margaret Sloan taken off nursing register to 'protect vulnerable'

The heads of Gladiators brutally killed for the amusement of Roman audiences may have been fed to dogs, it has been revealed. Skulls discovered within the boundaries of ancient London a quarter of a century ago are now believed to be those of gladiators - and the first results from the analysis of them has uncovered shocking new details. 'It is not a pretty picture,' Rebecca Redfern, from the centre for human bioarchaeology at the museum of London, said. Skulls discovered within the boundaries of ancient London a quarter of a century ago are now believed to be those belonging to gladiators, brutally killed for the amusement of Roman audiences. This skull shows sharp force injuries . 'At least one of the skulls shows evidence of being chewed at by dogs, so it was still fleshed when it was lying in the open.' The first analysis of the haul of 39 skulls, discovered beneath the site of the Guildhall in the City of London, was published this week. 'Examination of the sample using techniques employed by forensic anthropology and entomology found that some of the material had been deposited in open waterlogged pits,' the report says. 'The majority of the sample was adult males who had evidence for multiple peri-mortem blunt- and sharp- force injuries; many also had healed injuries, suggesting that violence was a common feature of their life.' They were discovered in 1988 and were believed to have originated from human remains washed out of burial sites by the Walbrook, one of the area’s lost rivers. But now after 25 years in storage, the remains have been re-examined by an historian from the Museum of London, who believes they are the first evidence of gladiators in London. Studies have revealed that most of the skulls show signs of injury before death  - despite them dying during peace time. The jawline of adult male with sharp force weapon injury. The studies reveal the skulls had almost certainly all been victims of violence . Rebecca Redfern, of the museum's Centre for Human Bioarchaeology, now believes that the skulls are either the result of sacrificial headhunting, or the remains of gladiators, killed for sport. Some of the heads had been decapitated and one of the haul had part of its jawbone sliced off - almost all had been the victims of violence - The Independent reports. 'The level of violence here exceeds the level needed to kill someone', Dr Redfern said, adding that they showed 'lethal, multiple blows to the head' alongside healed injuries consistent with a brutal life. The full findings of her research will be published this week in the Journal of Archaeological Science. The skulls were discovered in a pit beneath what is now a Waterstones bookshop - at 52 - 63 London Wall - which was excavated in 1988. The area was an industrial one in Roman times known as the Upper Walbrook Valley. An adult male jaw with marks of dog gnawing, examined by the team. The bones are believed to hold the first evidence of Roman gladiators in London . Although historians have known about the existence of an amphitheatre at the site for many years, Dr Redfern said it was the first time physical evidence of gladiators had been found in London. She said: 'It’s utterly, utterly amazing. We don’t have evidence for this type of thing in Roman London. She added: 'There is no primary source evidence for gladiators in London... There is a gladiator tombstone, but we think it was brought to Britain (from Europe no earlier than the 17th century). The Times reports that the remains were thrown into the pits between 120 and 160 AD - which was peace time in Roman Britain. Dr Redfern said the bones were not supposed to have been in the pits at all as this was within the walls of the City - where corpses were not supposed to have been buried. In August construction workers in London made an 'unexpected and fascinating discovery' during work on the city's billion pound Crossrail project. Around . 20 Roman skulls were unearthed by tunnellers working beneath . Liverpool Street Station, where the historic River Walbrook flows. A reconstruction drawing of Londinium. The skulls were discovered in a pit beneath what is now a Waterstones bookshop - at 52 - 63 London Wall - which was excavated in 1988 . Another haul of skulls and pottery was recently found below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century . Archaeologists believe the skulls, pictured, may have washed downstream along the River Walbrook. They were found six metres under the ground below what is thought to have been a 16th century burial ground for patients of the Bedlam hospital . Working . under the direction of Crossrail's archaeologists, the construction . workers carefully removed the human skulls and Roman pottery. They were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary. For . safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the . tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground. The cross-London scheme has already led . to a number of exciting discoveries, including around 4,000 skeletons . found buried in the Eldon Street area.

He follows figures such as Ali G, Sharon Osbourne and Baroness Lawrence in giving the festive address which is the station's answer to the Queen's message to the nation. The channel said it will be his first recorded TV film since Snowden arrived in Moscow, where he has been given asylum. Christmas message: Edward Snowden speaks during an interview in Hong Kong . Computer analyst Snowden became a wanted man more than seven months ago when his leaks brought to light secret National Security Agency documents which revealed widespread US surveillance on phone and internet communications. It led to not only embarrassment but also friction with other countries when the extent of the surveillance emerged. Channel 4 said that in his message he talks about 'why privacy matters and why he believes mass indiscriminate surveillance by governments of their people is wrong'. Snowden said: 'Great Britain's George Orwell warned us of the danger of this kind of information. The types of collection in the book - microphones and video cameras, TVs that watch us - are nothing compared to what we have available today. We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person. Snowden warned of dangers to democracy in the first video released of the fugitive since arriving in Russia . 'A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all. They'll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves, an unrecorded, unanalysed thought. And that's a problem because privacy matters, privacy is what allows us to determine who we are and who we want to be.' He added: 'The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it. Together we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying.' Snowden's passport was revoked and a warrant was issued for his arrest - for passing on classified information and theft of government property - when his leaks came to light. Channels 4's head of news and current affairs Dorothy Byrne said: 'Edward Snowden's decision to reveal the extent of surveillance programmes was one of the most significant news events of the year. 'The information which he has placed in the public domain raises serious questions for democratic society. This is an opportunity for our viewers to hear from him directly and judge for themselves what he has to say.' :: The Alternative Christmas Message will broadcast tomorrow at 4.15pm on Channel 4.","Edward Snowden follows Ali G and Sharon Osbourne .

An indebted city trader was shot by an attacker wearing a black balaclava as he went to catch an early morning train to work - and police are probing whether the attack was connected with his money problems. Robin . Clark, 44, was getting out of his vehicle in a railway station car park . with a male friend at around 5.45am yesterday when he was approached by . the mystery gunman who shot him once in the thigh before fleeing. Mr Clark, who works at brokers firm RP . Martin, was attacked at Shenfield railway station in Essex before being rushed to nearby Basildon Hospital with serious leg . injuries. Police sources described the shooting as 'some kind of revenge attack'. It's understood that Mr Clark, who is believed to have owned three Porsches, has financial problems. In April 2013, a county court judgment was filed against him for debts of £14,653. And the twice-divorced father of four last year moved out of the £2.2million five-bedroom . house he rented in nearby Ingatestone, Essex, amid the debt issues. A . police source confirmed officers were investigating the possibility the . man was shot down by a love rival or because of problems with money. The source said: ‘It’s clear that he meant the shot to be a punishment rather than to kill. It’s some kind of revenge attack.’ Meanwhile friends of Mr Clark spoke of his party-loving lifestyle, describing him as a 'high octane city boy.' Referring to new Martin Scorsese film The Wolf Of Wall Street, which chronicles the hedonistic life of a trader, sources described Mr Clark affectionately as 'the Wolf of Shenfield' to The Sun as he 'plays hard and loves the ladies'. His classic car-dealing friend Steve Hurn told the paper that Mr Clark had a love of classic cars, particularly Porsches. Mr Clark is said to have saved the life of a female colleague from the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York, after urging her to flee from the World Trade Center's south tower before the second plane struck, according to The Times.

According to a LinkedIn profile in his . name, Mr Clark joined RP Martin in June 2013 after a seven-year stint at . U.S. firm BGC Partners. A spokesman for the firm yesterday said: ‘We are aware of this morning’s incident and are giving Robin all the support we can.’ Dozens of armed officers from Essex Police were scrambled to the scene while a large section of the car park was taped off .

An attorney for two political organizations tied closely to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday that the U.S. Attorney's office has issued subpoenas for documents related to the September 2013 'Bridgegate' scandal. Mark Sheridan, an attorney at the Patton Boggs law firm, represents both Christie for Governor and the New Jersey Republican Committee. He told reporters that his clients 'intend to cooperate' with U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman's office, and with the Democrat-led state legislative panel that has already issued similar subpoenas. Lawmakers in Trenton also subpoenaed 18 officials tied to Christie, including some in his governing inner circle and others in his political organization. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman is no stranger to high-profile cases, and now he's embarking on an investigation into a corruption-tinted political story that has gripped the whole nation . New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie is fighting a tide of scandals that threaten to replace his populist popularity with something more Nixonian . BRIDGEGATE: Christie aide Bridget Kelly kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful email to Port Authority official David Wildstein on August 13, subpoenaed documents show . The Newark Star-Ledger was first to report the latest development in the Christie soap opera. The scandal is accelerating at a quickening pace as Christie begins his second term in office, creating new levels of pressure as he considers whether to enter the 2016 presidential race. He has fought off accusations of corruption since State Assembly Democrats released a trove of emails and text messages indicating that his then-deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, conspired with Port Authority official David Wildstein, a Christie appointee, to snarl traffic leading from Fort Lee, N.J. to the iconic George Washington Bridge. The scheme is believed to have been a form of political payback directed at Fort Lee's Democratic Mayor Mark Sokolich, who declined to endorse Christie's 2013 re-election run. WIldstein and another Christie appointee resigned in December. The governor publicly fired Kelly this month and pledged that he had no advance knowledge of the plot or any involvement with it. State Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski is leading a Special Committee on Investigations that has issued its own subpoenas -- 20 in all -- targeting the same information now sought by the feds . Christie seems determined to ride out the storm as the 2016 run for the White House beckons . But in the weeks since then, other Democrats have claimed Christie played a part in political dirty-tricks episodes. Hoboken mayor Dawn Zimmer said Lieutenant Gov. Kim Guadagno threatened, at Christie's urging, to withhold federal disaster relief funds after Hurricane Sandy struck, unless she agreed to green-light a commercial development proposal favored by the governor. Scandal 2.0: Elizabeth, N.J. Mayor Christian Bollwage says Christie shut down his city's DMV as political payback . Olympic track and field legend Carl Lewis claimed Guadagno torpedoed his political aspirations when she was New Jersey's attorney general, striking him off an election ballot because he wanted to run against a longtime Christie friend and ally. And three Democratic politicians said Christie's administration closed down a DMV in Elizabeth, N.J., the state's fourth-largest city, because they â€“ the city's mayor and two state legislative representatives â€“ supported his election opponent and opposed his tax policies. Fishman, the federal prosecutor pursuing information in the bridge case, was appointed by Barack Obama in 2009. He succeeded Christie in the job after he left to run for governor. The Star-Ledger reported Thursday that his team, which may include FBI agents, has been busily interviewing witnesses to see which complaints merit full-blown investigations.","An attorney confirm that federal prosecutors are demanding documents related to the George Washington Bridge lane closures in September .

A teenager bitten by a false widow as she watched a horror film feared she would lose her hand after the poison spread through her veins. Stephanie Georgiou was rushed to hospital and needed three operations after she was nipped by the spider on a date at the Enfield cinema earlier this month. She has since had two operations to . remove tissue from her hand that have left her with a two by three . centimetre wound that will require grafting with skin from her arm, . leaving her permanently scarred. Stephanie Georgiou was bitten by a spider whilst watching the film Paranormal Activity . The bite had become swollen and full of pus and it was so painful it made her cry . The 18-year-old has been scarred for life . and left so traumatised by the experience that she has vowed to never . go back to the cinema again. With her right arm in a sling, speaking today the final year childcare student said: 'When I found out they had to operate I was scared I would lose my hand. 'They have had to take two massive chunks out to make sure all the infection has been cut out. 'I can't face going back to another movie, it's been the worst thing ever.' Miss Georgiou visited the Enfield Cineworld on January 2 - the day after her 18th birthday - for an evening showing of Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones. Describing the moment she was bitten, she said: 'It happened right at the start of the film when the adverts were playing. She was rushed to the Chase Farm hospital with a raised heartbeat and fever which doctors suspected was down to a false widow bite . 'I felt this thing like an electric shock, and I scratched my right hand but didn't think about it and carried on watching the film. 'I started feeling really hot, but I thought it was just the temperature in the cinema, and my hand was itching. 'Then when we left I didn't feel right, I was really dizzy and I snapped at my date.' It wasn't until a three days later that Miss Georgiou realised something was seriously wrong with her hand. The bite had become swollen and full of pus and it was so painful it made her cry. Her GP immediately recognised she had been bitten by an insect, but did not suspect it was from the potentially deadly false widow. She was given some antibiotics but her hand turned bright red as the poison spread. The teen returned home but her condition deteriorated and she was rushed to the Chase Farm hospital the next day with a raised heartbeat and fever which doctors suspected was down to a false widow bite. She has had an operation after the wound left her permanently scarred. Today Cineworld issued an apology to Miss . Georgiu, saying they were 'deeply sorry' about the alleged false widow . bite and were taking 'expert advice to ensure our cinemas are free from . any kind of insect/ pest control.' However, the cinema bite is probably an isolated case, according to London Zoo keeper and invertebrate expert Craig Walker. He said: 'The spiders are found mostly down in the south east of England, living in indoor places and they hang their webs under things where its warm and where you don't vacuum. She has had two operations to remove tissue from her hand that have left her with a wound . 'They often come into the country on produce and it's likely that in this case a spider came to the cinema in someone's shopping, or on a coat or some clothing that had been kept in a cupboard. 'But it would be very unusual for them to live in a cinema. I would imagine there is a lot of cleaning and vacuuming of the velour seats, the constant up and down motion would disturb their webs and they need to feed on other live animals - but a human is a bit big for them.' Miss Georgiou suffered a bad reaction to her bite, although the danger posed by the tiny spiders shouldn't be exaggerated. Mr Walker continued: 'They are generally not harmful, but like most spiders they are venomous and if you do happen to be sensitive to the venom then they do pose a risk. 'We don't worry like this about bees, but there are many deaths every year from bee stings. I am yet to hear of anyone dying from a false widow. 'But remember if you are bitten by something and have an unusual reaction you should go to the hospital to have it checked out.'","Stephanie Georgiou was rushed to hospital and needed three operations after she was nipped by the spider on a date at the cinema .

Two weeks after cascades of snow prevented vehicles from getting into the city of Valdez, at the end of the trans-Alaska pipeline, the only road into town has reopened. Crews finished clearing away the remaining avalanche debris, and there was no damage to Richardson Highway. A dozen or so avalanches combined to close the road on January 24, including two that completely covered the highway and about 10 that partially covered it. Open road: It's official - The 'Damalanche' is gone. The state Department of Transportation reopened Richardson Highway near Valdez on Wednesday morning after a series of monster avalanches blocked the city's only artery to the state road system for 12 days .

Trouble-free journey:  The avalanche dammed the Lowe River, creating a half-mile-long lake that stalled snow removal between Mile 12 and 18 for nearly a week. The blockage was dubbed the Damalanche by residents . Banks of snow about 40ft high were dumped on Richardson Highway, which runs parallel to the trans-Alaska pipeline.

Almost clear: The Richardson Highway, near Mile 16, is buried under debris from a massive avalanche near Keystone Canyon . Clearing-up: Alaska highway officials say they expect to reopen an avalanche-choked highway by Wednesday afternoon, nearly two weeks after walls of snow cut off the only road into Valdez . One major avalanche was in Thompson Pass at Mile 39. That avalanche and the smaller ones were cleared last week.

An elderly Oregon woman had part of her right arm amputated after a truck hood slammed on it and she was forced to stand 18 hours in snowy weather until being rescued. Joan Zuber, 68, from rural Molalla, went outside last week to charge her truck’s battery when a gust of wind blew the hood shut – she was forced to stand while enduring falling snow and bitter cold until neighbors rescued her 18 hours later. Doctors at a local hospital were forced to remove her right hand and part of her arm and said she was lucky to be alive, her family told the New York Daily News. Tough as nails: Joan Zuber, 68, survived being trapped 18 hours in bitter cold, but doctors amputated her right hand and part of her arm . Her truck: Zuber was attending the battery in this truck, a Ford F150, when a gust of wind blew the hood shut and trapped her hand inside . 'Doctors said she probably wouldn't have survived another day . ,' daughter Heather Zuber, 37, told the paper. The avid mountain climber and outdoors aficionado drew upon her decades of mountaineering all over the world to get her through the ordeal - jogging in place and strategically yelling for help in a way that would cut through the dense forest, her daughter explained. 'She really is that tough,' Heather Zuber said. 'With her rock climbing and mountaineering, she's had a lot of training. She probably had plenty of time to think about what she would do if she was found . .' Her mental fortitude got her through a situation that might have claimed the life of a lesser person. She actually had snow accumulate on her during the ordeal, a firefighter told ABC News. 'Hand trapped, you can’t kneel or sit on the hood, and you are in a standing position for 18 hours. It actually snowed on her throughout the night,’ Molalla Fire Department spokesperson Mike Penunuri told ABC. ‘It took a very strong will to survive that.’ Avid hiker: Zuber spent much of her time outdoors, pictured rock climbing in Nevada, her experience likely saved her life . World traveler: The gritty matriarch, pictured in Italy in 2009, traveled around the world to hike and rock climb . Joan Zuber had worn several layers during what was only intended to be a short trip outside, Mr Penunuri credited those layers with likely saving her life. ‘She was dressed in several layers of clothing, several shirts, outer garments, a vest, a coat, and heavy pants,’ he said. ‘I’ve gone out in jeans and tennis shoes to do something really quick,’ he added. ‘If she had done that, I don’t think she would have survived. The hypothermia would have killed her.’ Temperatures barely stayed above freezing through the night, the woman told rescuers she stayed warm by jogging in place, he added. She was found around 11 a.m. Thursday after having been outside since 5 p.m. the previous day, according to KPHO. Neighbor Mary Nunn heard her desperate cries for help while riding horses nearby. They released the hood and immediately called 911. ‘We were out riding our horses today and we heard a lady screaming from across the canyon,’ a lady said during a 911 call made public by KPHO. Upbeat: Daughter Heather Zuber said her mother remains positive and is 'looking forward to the challenge of learning something new' ‘Just let her know help is on the way,’ the dispatcher can be heard responding. 'She’s kept her cool the whole time so, she’s a very strong lady,' Nunn told KATU. The gritty woman is now in recovering in the hospital but expected to be released later this week, her daughter said.

A former SAC Capital Advisors portfolio manager has been convicted of helping his company earn more than a quarter billion dollars illegally through insider trading. Mathew Martoma was found guilty on Thursday on two counts of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, putting an end to his three-week long trial that capped a decade-long investigation into SAC Captial. While he remained expressionless as the verdict was handed down, tears streamed down the face of his wife, who sat with her hands folded on her yellow dress. He could face up to a decade behind bars. The courtroom examination of the . trades focused largely on his dealings with clients pertaining to the . secret testing of a potential breakthrough Alzheimer's drug. The . trial also contained frequent mentions of SAC Capital's billionaire . founder, Steven A. Cohen, who is one of the richest men in the country . with an estimated personal net worth of $9.4billion. Verdict: Mathew Martoma, 39, was found guilty on two counts of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud but his sentence has not been handed down . Defense lawyer Richard Strassberg said in his closing argument Monday that Cohen was the real target of investigators. He said his client was victimized by the testimony of doctors who traded their credibility for plea deals that left them beholden to the government. He said the doctors learned 'just how frighteningly scary it can be if you get in the way of a government investigation that's targeting someone like Steve Cohen.' Founder: SAC Capital Advisors is led Steve Cohen, one of the richest men in the country . Sidney Gilman, an 81-year-old former professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School, testified that he gave Martoma the secret results of the drug trial sponsored by drug makers Elan Corp. and Wyeth nearly two weeks before they were publicly announced. He said he was charmed by Martoma, 39, . who seemed more knowledgeable about his work than hundreds of others in . the financial community who paid Gilman more than $1million over . several years for consultations. Gilman . said he could not recall giving similar information to anyone else, . though he conceded that he 'perhaps unintentionally... may have slipped . here and there'. Assistant U.S. Attorney Arlo . Devlin-Brown told the jury that after the doctor showed Martoma the test . results in one of 43 consultations the pair had, Martoma sent Cohen an . early morning email asking: 'Is there a good time to catch up with you . this morning? It's important.' A half hour later, they spoke for 20 minutes on the phone. The . next day, Devlin-Brown said, Martoma and SAC Capital began selling all . their shares in Elan and Wyeth and building a short position that would . make millions of dollars when the stock of both companies plummeted . following the public announcement of the drug trial's results. The government said the trades on both ends earned $275 million in profits, enough to score a $9.3 million bonus for Martoma. 'Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Martoma, though all of this circumstantial evidence, has been caught with his hand deep inside the cookie jar, and defense counsel wants you to think that maybe he was just putting the cookie back,' Devlin-Brown said in his closing. Headed in: Martoma, joined by his wife Rosemary, was charged over his dealings on a specific Alzheimer's drug . The prosecutor said Gilman, formerly one of the top Alzheimer's researchers in the world, has all but ended his career. 'He's 81, and he's humiliated,' Devlin-Brown said. Strassberg told jurors Gilman's 'story at its heart makes no sense' because his memory was flawed when he met with Martoma in 2008 while he was undergoing chemotherapy for successful cancer treatments. Another doctor, Joel Ross, testified that he also gave Martoma secrets about the Alzheimer drug test, in part because he hoped Martoma would connect him with biotechnology companies that might provide business for his new drug research center in Eatontown, New Jersey. SAC Capital pleaded guilty in November to fraud charges and agreed to pay $1.8billion to settle charges that it allowed, if not encouraged, insider trading for more than a decade. Cohen has not been criminally charged, but the Securities and Exchange Commission has accused him in a civil action of failing to prevent insider trading at the company, which he founded in 1992 and bears his initials. Cohen has disputed the allegations. Upset: Martoma, whose wife wept openly when the verdict was handed down, paid a researcher more than $1million for consultations on yet-unreleased drugs to help him advise his clients . The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan praised Thursday's verdict, comparing Martoma's actions to buying an answer sheet before an exam. 'As the jury unanimously found, Mathew Martoma cultivated and purchased the confidence of doctors with secret knowledge of an experimental Alzheimer's drug, and used it to engage in illegal insider trading,' the prosecutors said in a statement. 'In the short run, cheating may have been profitable for Martoma, but in the end, it made him a convicted felon.' There was no mention at trial of Martoma's educational record at Harvard Law School, where he was expelled in 1999 after he used a forged transcript he claimed he created to impress his parents to apply for a clerkship with as many as 23 federal appeals judges. A sentencing date wasn't immediately set. Martoma's attorney declined to comment after the verdict was read.","Mathew Martoma, 39, has been found guilty of two counts of insider trading .

No need to get the violins out for the owner of a rare Stradivarius that was thought lost - it appears to have been found. Police in Milwaukee say that the rare . multi-million dollar Stradivarius stolen from a concertmaster last month . has been recovered in Milwaukee. Authorities are working to confirm the violin is the one stolen from Frank Almond . in a brazen attack outside Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee January 27. 'It has to be confirmed . as to the actual authenticity of what it is,' said Lt. Jeffrey Norman. Police will contact experts to provide that confirmation, Norman said. He did not comment on the condition of the recovered violin. Scroll down for video . Loss: Frank Almond, right, had just finished a concert when he was attacked by a robber who stole his violin . Rare: The Lipinski Stradivarius, crafted in 1715, was on permanent loan to the concertmaster . Prosecutors confirmed Wednesday that . three people have been arrested in connection with the theft. Two men, . ages 41 and 36, and a 32-year-old woman, are in custody and could be in . Milwaukee County Circuit Court Thursday. Almond . was walking to his car following a performance at the college when . someone jumped out of a van, shocked him with a stun gun and seized the . Stradivarius, which was on loan to him. The robber got back into the . waiting vehicle, which sped off. Almond . was knocked to the ground but wasn't seriously hurt. He was devastated . by the loss of the violin, which was crafted in 1715 and has been . appraised for insurance purposes at $5 million. The owner of the violin . has not been revealed. The . case in which Almond kept the instrument was found, and the Milwaukee . Symphony Orchestra announced someone was offering $100,000 for the . instrument's safe return. A message seeking comment from the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra wasn't immediately returned Thursday. The . violin is known in musical circles as the 'Lipinski' Stradivarius. Its . previous owners include virtuoso Giuseppe Tartini, who was known for his . 'Devil's Trill' Sonata, and Polish violinist Karol Lipinski. The violin had been previously owned by a string of high-profile musicians, including Devil's Trill composer Giuseppe Tartini, wand Polish violinist Karol Lipinski. The Lipinski Stradivarius was crafted in 1715 by Antonio Stradiveri. An early owner was composer Guiseppe Tartini, who gave it to his student, Salvini. Salvini passed ownership to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski. After Lipinski played for him, Salvini is said to have smashed the musician's violin, before handing him the Stradivarius and saying, 'Try this instrument'. After Lipinski's death in 1861 the violin was acquired by Engelbert RÃ¶ntgen, and it stayed with his family for three generations. In the 1940s the violin was sent to Cuba, where it was owned by a supporter of the Havana Symphony. But after fleeing the revolution, the violinist was forced to sell the instrument so he could start a new life in the U.S. It was bought in New York in 1962 by Evi Liivak, an Estonian who played secret concerts to keep spirits raised during the Nazi occupation. In 2008, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra's  Frank Almond was given the violin on permanent loan. Source: A Violin's Life . It had survived the Cuban revolution, during which its sale helped a Havana musician escape to the U.S., and was used in concerts across Europe by a woman who escaped the Nazis. 'The artistic heritage of Milwaukee was assaulted and robbed last night,' Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said. Mr Almond, who studied at the Juilliard academy in New York, was left incapacitated on the sidewalk after being hit by a taser, as the thief fled to a maroon or burgundy minivan that was waiting nearby. The violin's case was found, empty and discarded, near the scene of the attack. Only a few hundred Stradivarius violins, crafted by Antonio Stradiveri, remain in the world. Mr Almond was offered the use of the violin in 2008, when a family clearing the estate of a dead relative contacted the concertmaster to ask his opinion of an instrument they had found. In an interview with The Violinist last . year, Mr Almond recalled how he had at first been skeptical, saying . that he is regularly contacted by people who believe they have found a . rare instrument. After . meeting the owners, who showed him paperwork and old concert programs, . Mr Almond was led to a bank vault where the precious violin had been . stored for 20 years. 'It . turned out that they had put it in a bank vault - a regular bank vault . at M & I Bank, which happened to be about, I'd say, 100 yards from . the concert hall,' Mr Almond said. Loan: Concertmaster Frank Almond at a performance. The violinist was tasered by an attacker on Monday . Attack: Frank Almond had just performed at a concert in Wisconsin Lutheran College . 'It was ironic - I'd been playing all the time in this hall, and there was a 1715 Strad, down the street in a bank vault.' The violin had an impressive pedigree, and allowed Mr Almond to perform on an instrument once used by 'godfather of modern violin playing' Tartini, and Lipinski. 'If you start thinking about everything behind that instrument, it's easy to feel quite tiny,' Mr Almond said in a previous interview. 'Sure, it was creepy to play the Devil's Trill sonata for the first couple times. But that's what the violin is for: playing. 'It's going to be here a lot longer than I am, and every day that I'm able to play on it, to me, it's amazing.' Craftsman: An illustration of Antonio Stradivari, who made the missing violin in 1715 . Origins: The violin's early owners included Giuseppe Tartini, left, and Karol Lipinski, right . Generations of music: The violin was also owned by Engelbert Rontgen, left, and Evi Liivak, right . Well traveled: Frank Almond waits to board a plane with the rare violin in 2009 . Its last owner had been a child prodigy from Estonia, whose music studies in Budapest were cut short when her father was killed by the Gestapo. Evi Liivak was known for playing secret concerts in bunkers to raise the spirits of those living under Nazi oppression. She took possession of the violin in New York in 1962, when her husband, a Milwaukee pianist, bought it for $19,000 from a Cuban who was forced to sell it after escaping Havana. Its enticing history led Mr Almond to record A Violin's Life in tribute to it. The CD features him playing pieces that had been composed or were associated with its various owners in the past 300 years. Although the violin needs to be played regularly to keep it in good condition, the aged instrument must also be kept in a temperature-controlled environment to preserve it.

The FAA told The AP about the planned assessments of the towers' lightning protection systems after responding to a Freedom of Information Act request about the Sept. 12, 2013, lightning strike at the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. Issues: Officials are looking for problems with the systems that protect the towers from lightning strikes . The FAA said in a statement that the . accident was 'the first of its kind in FAA history,' and the agency . plans on 'assessing the condition' of lightning protection systems at . the 440 air traffic control towers it is responsible for across the . country. In particular, the agency said it will examine lightning . protection at more than 200 towers that were built prior to 1978, when . the FAA first issued standards for the protection systems. Because . of their height, airport towers have a greater chance of being struck . by lightning, and tower designers plan for the bolts. Towers are built . with lightning rods and wiring to direct the electrical current from a . strike harmlessly into the ground. That protects the tower and equipment . from damage and protects the air traffic controllers working inside. Strike: The control tower at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. A lightning strike on the tower, which also injured an air traffic controller, is prompting the Federal Aviation Administration to examine hundreds of air traffic control towers nationwide . But the system in place at BWI's . airport tower failed last Sept. 12 during an afternoon thunderstorm. As . lightning flashed and a wall of rain moved in, air traffic controller . Edward Boyd, who was working in the tower, saw sparks and heard an . electrical snap coming from a piece of equipment that controls runway . lighting. A few minutes . later, he turned on a generator to ensure the airport's runway lighting . stayed on, part of a standard procedure during a storm. Boyd had his . right hand on the generator switch when he saw lightning flash outside . and felt a shock on his ring finger. 'It . basically felt like somebody had whacked me on the tip of the finger . with a tool of some kind,' he said during a recent interview, describing . a stinging sensation. Boyd, an air traffic controller for more than 30 years, dropped to one knee and told colleagues: 'I got hit.' Boyd . was taken to the hospital and wasn't allowed to return to work for . about two months. He says lingering nerve problems in his hand will . require surgery, and he called the incident a 'fluke.' John . Dunkerly, president of BWI's chapter of the National Air Traffic . Controllers Association, said he had never heard of a similar incident . in his more than 30 years in air traffic control. Delays: Many flights  at Baltimore were either delayed or canceled because of a lightning strike to the airport's air traffic control tower, leading controllers to stop all arrivals and departures at the airport for more than two hours in September last year . Air traffic controllers ultimately stopped all arrivals and departures at the airport, one of the nation's 30 busiest, for more than two hours because of concerns about the tower's safety. More than 100 flights were canceled and about 75 delayed that afternoon and evening, according to the flight tracking service FlightAware. Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act showed that an investigation after the strike identified several electrical issues in Baltimore's tower, which was built in 1960 and renovated in 1983. For example, one cable designed to take electrical current from a lightning strike to the ground had been cut during construction at the airport, probably years ago. Chuck Graves, who heads the FAA office that oversees airport towers' lightning protection, wrote in an email to colleagues that given the 'demonstrated vulnerability of the facility,' the tower's lightning protection systems should be overhauled. The FAA told The AP it has approved $400,000 to address the tower's lightning protection systems. Preliminary work started there this week. The FAA also is working on replacing the tower itself. The agency said in 2013 that officials had begun preliminary planning for a new tower at the airport, and the FAA has a program in place to replace aging facilities. On average, air traffic control towers are 26 years old and in many cases, they do not meet today's building requirements, the FAA said in a 2013 budget document submitted to Congress. As for the assessments of other towers, it is not clear when those will begin. FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said they are now in the planning stages. Assessments of older towers and towers at airports where there is a lot of construction will likely take priority, and once the assessments are completed, the agency may need to request additional money to do repairs, Lunsford said.","FAA will be looking for problems with the lightning protection systems for airport towers .

A well-respected doctor has been accused of illegally writing thousands of prescriptions for addictive pain-killers which were then distributed on the black market. Dr Robert Terdiman, a highly-qualified consultant, is said to have pocketed $12 million in return for writing nearly 19,000 prescriptions for oxycodone pills - a strong morphine-like pain killer - for fake patients which a gang then sold on to addicts. The 68-year-old - who had run his own successful practice until he was sued for medical malpractice - is one of a dozen suspects arrested over the drug ring which operated out of a Astramed clinic in the Bronx, New York. Prosecutors claim fake patients would visit the Astramed clinic where staff members, including Terdiman, would issue them with prescriptions for oxycodone in return for a fee of between $200 and $300 a time. Scroll down for video . Drug ring: Dr Robert Terdiman, pictured in a white shirt outside the Astramed Physicians clinic in New York, is accused of illegally writing thousands of prescriptions for pain killers in return for money . The clinic issued a total of 31,500 medically unnecessary prescriptions - approximately 5.5 million oxycodone pills worth $550million - over the course of three years. Terdiman is said to have written 18,700 of the prescriptions for . oxycodone for more than . 4,000 'patients' in just 20 months. The prescriptions were filled at pharmacies and drug dealers then resold the pills on the streets in New York and across America. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement: 'The world of prescription drug trafficking is looking more and more like the world of old-school trafficking in narcotics like heroin, cocaine and crack. 'The traffickers were supplied with prescriptions by corrupt doctors and clinic employees, dispensed to lower-level ""pretend"" patients so that massive quantities of oxycodone could be distributed wherever the most money could be made, often in communities hundreds of miles away. 'This is poison by prescription, and the volume and money allegedly involved would make hardened illegal drug traffickers envious.' Addictive: Dr Terdiman is said to have written 18,700 prescriptions for Oxycodone - a highly-addictive morphine-like drug - in the space of 20 months . Terdiman is accused of writing nearly 18,700 prescriptions for oxycodone â€” issuing approximately three million pills â€” for more than 4,000 'patients' in just 20 months from June 2012. New York City Special Narcotic Prosecutor Bridget Brennan told CBS New York: 'He was far and away the most prolific prescription writer that we have seen.' Terdiman, who graduated from NYU School of Medicine in 1971, had been a very successful doctor with his own thriving practice until he was sued for medical malpractice in 2004. He is understood to have separated from his wife shortly afterwards and lost the sprawling $1.2million home he shared with his family, according to New York Daily News. Terdiman struggled to rebuild his career afterwards and was left out of work for five years until he began working at Astramed in June 2012. After hardly ever writing a prescription for oxycodone throughout his time as a doctor, Terdiman issued more than three million of the pills to his 'patients' in the space of 20 months. By the time of his arrest, he was living in the rundown Tuckahoe Motor Inn in Yonkers, New York, with a gun and bullets hidden inside his TV. Terdiman is being held without bail and is due back in court on Feb 19. Tough times: Dr Terdiman had his own successful practice until he was sued for medical malpractice in 2004.

An Orthodox Jewish woman has finally won her freedom after a two-year battle for religious divorce from her husband. Gital Dodelson has been granted a 'get' by her ex-husband Avrohom Meir Weiss, after the pair legally divorced in 2012. Three months ago the 25-year-old opened up about her struggle to untangle herself from her ex-husband, who exerted his control over her by manipulating Jewish law. Gital Dodelson, 25, divorced her husband Avrohom Meir Weiss in 2012. After a four-year battle to be granted a 'get' -  the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by Jewish law, she has finally won her freedom . The law student, who lives in Lakewood, New Jersey, told the New York Post she divorced Mr Weiss in 2012, but spent years trying to get him to grant her the 'get' - a document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognised by Jewish law. Without the document, she was seen as an agunah - a chained woman - in the eyes of the Orthodox community, who considered her still married to Mr Weiss. The mother-of-one from Lakewood, New . Jersey, explained that her husband - whom she said has always been a . controlling man - comes from a respected rabbinic family, making it all . the more difficult to loosen herself from his power. After . numerous attempts to reach an agreement, all met with the same . defiance, Ms Dodelson has decided to make her story public in an effort . to move on with her life. She . says she saw signs that Mr Weiss would be a difficult husband just . three days into their marriage in 2009, when they spent their first . Shabbat together in complete silence. Explaining . that the observance is typically a female tradition, she says he lost . his temper when she was telling him how it was done in her family. 'When my way contradicted his way, he criticized me and turned angry,' she wrote. Her husband then told her: 'You have . no choice. It's not my way' - an attitude he was to exhibit consistently . over the following four years. The couple separated within a year of getting married, prompting a bitter battle between their Orthodox families, with Weiss reportedly demanding upwards of $350,000 to settle the matter. Miss Dodelson told the Post, in November: 'On my last mission to ask for a get, a . month ago, Avrohom said, ""I can’t give you a get — how else would I . control you?"" 'I think that’s the key to it all. He insists the marriage . isn’t over until he says it’s over.' A . Facebook group Free Gital: Tell Avrohom Meir Weiss to Give His Wife a . 'Get' was set up, attracting more than 14,000 supporters across the . world. Miss Dodelson's publicist, Shira Dicker, said she could not say why Weiss had changed his mind. The Weiss family, when approached for comment, declined. Miss . Dicker said Miss Dodelson and her family have vowed to set up a . not-for-profit organisation to help other women facing similar problems . win their freedom. Refusing to grant a get is viewed in Jewish law as domestic abuse, but Mr Weiss had said he would sign only if she rearranged the custody arrangement and gave him $350,000 . She added: 'The family isn't just skipping into the sunset. There's a real sense of responsibility here.' Mr Weiss not only took control when it came to religious observances, but also when it came to the couple's finances, despite his wife being the sole breadwinner. When she suggested couples therapy, he refused, and every attempt to communicate was met with silence and hostility. It was when she became pregnant that she decided to take a stand against her overbearing other half. 'I thought: ""How can I bring a child into this world with a virtual stranger? Someone I'm so disconnected from?""' she said. Mr Weiss ultimately granted her a divorce - after first attempting to file for sole custody of their son Aryeh. He repeatedly refused to give her a get, something which in Jewish law is viewed as domestic abuse. As a man he was free to date other women, while his ex-wife was stuck in limbo in a community where her moving on would have been classed as adultery.","Gital Dodelson was legally divorced from Avrohom Meir Weiss in 2012 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:39 EST, 6 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:42 EST, 6 February 2014 . A judge has ruled that drivers can legally flash their headlights to warn other drivers about upcoming speed traps because he views it as a form of free speech. In the past, some drivers who did so were pulled over themselves by angry police officers and issued tickets as a penalty for warning the other drivers about hidden police cars. The case that sparked the ruling comes out of St Louis, Missouri where the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of Michael Elli, who flashed his headlights to warn oncoming vehicles of a radar trap was set up by Ellisville police on November 17, 2012. Warning signs: Drivers on one side of a highway can often see hidden police cars or radar set ups that will inevitably target drivers on the other side of the highway, and sometimes they flash their headlights as a warning . An officer saw the flash and pulled Elli over, citing him for a city ordinance violation, though a similar statute exists in Missouri law. Elli was told he would likely face a fine of up to $1,000 if convicted. The case was eventually dropped and Ellisville City Attorney George Restovich said the city changed the policy and no longer pulls over people for flashing headlights. Now U.S. District Judge Henry E. Autrey has made that a more-permanent measure, issuing a preliminary injunction on Monday prohibiting Ellisville police from continuing the practice. 'The reality is that the injunction doesn't change the way the city has been operating for the past 12 months,' Restovich said. Still, Ellisville continued to fight the suit. At a hearing last year, Ellisville officials made the case that flashing headlights could interfere with a police investigation. Ellisville's city attorney has now said there are no plans to appeal the injunction. Judge Autrey said in his ruling that the flashing of headlights was essentially a good thing, sending 'a message to bring one's driving in conformity with the law â€” whether it be by slowing down, turning on one's own headlamps at dusk or in the rain, or proceeding with caution.' Changing tactics: Now drivers who 'warn' others cannot be penalized . Jonathan Turley, a criminal attorney and a professor at George Washington University Law School, said courts across the country are dealing with the same issue. In virtually every case except those still being decided, the person cited has prevailed, Turley said. 'This has sweeping implications for the First Amendment,' Turley said. 'What this citizen is doing is warning other citizens about the violation of law. People regularly warn others about the possibility of arrest. There's no difference between a verbal warning and a mechanical warning. Both are forms of speech.' Jeffrey A. Mittman, executive director of the ACLU of Missouri, said that since filing the suit, his office has heard from many other drivers across Missouri complaining about similar police practices. 'It is important that law enforcement officers in other jurisdictions take note of this federal court decision and the ACLU-MO's commitment to free speech,' Mittman said in a statement.","Missouri police gave a citation to a man who flashed his headlights to warn oncoming cars of a hidden speeding radar set up .

The object, which appears to have a triangular shape, appeared in the so-called 'UFO Triangle', an area off the Cornwall coast where spooky sightings are common. The region has more paranormal activity than anywhere else in Britain, according to the Cornwall UFO Research Group. Cosmic? The object could be a meteor giving out a bright light as it burns up in the sky . However, sceptics may suggest that it is more likely to be a meteor burning up in the sky as it shoots towards Earth. Meteors are typically tiny pieces of space debris which can date back as far as 4.3billion years. They create a bright light as they burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, travelling at speeds of up to 45 miles per second. The orange colour of the UFO suggests that it may have been a meteor composed primarily of sodium, which typically produces an orange or yellow hue.","Amateur photographer captures image of mysterious light above Cornwall .

Dying: The ground below their metal cages is littered with feces, Krispy Kreme doughnuts, dog food and fruit . They've been kept in these dirty pens since birth, bred for a single purpose: to be killed for their bile. But these bears aren't dying. The industry is. Though their bile has been used as medicine in Asia for thousands of years, cheaper foreign sources, growing skepticism over bear bile's medicinal value and worries about international condemnation have led to a huge drop in South Korean demand. Kim KwangSoo, the owner of this farm in Dangjin, about 120 kilometers (about 75 miles) south of Seoul, said he hasn't had a bear bile customer in five years. That, however, doesn't ensure the animals a peaceful future. Cruel: Bears look out from a cage at a bear farm in Dangjin, south of Seoul, South Korea . The government is offering farmers money and incentives to sterilise or slaughter their bears, but the farmers are demanding much more. Kim, secretary general of a bear farmers' association, said farmers are considering suing or even more drastic measures - such as harming their bears - if they can't reach a deal. He said farmers will raise the issue of greater government compensation during a meeting with government officials and civilian experts Thursday. To highlight their grievances, farmers in November brought caged bears to downtown Seoul and near a government complex in the city of Sejong. Kim said farmers are now considering hauling bears, 20 per cage, to the Sejong government complex in the hope that the fighting, cramped animals will bring them attention. 'People talk about animal welfare ... but bear farmers aren't getting any welfare,' said Yun Youngdeok, who runs a bear farm near Seoul. Helpless: A bear stretches its paw through a cage at a bear farm in Dangjin, south of Seoul, South Korea . 'We feel like we are dying earlier (than our bears).' South Korea is one of the few countries that allow the farming of bears to extract bile for traditional medicine. About 50 farms are raising about 1,000 bears, mostly Asiatic black bears, also known as moon bears. They are the descendants of bears imported from Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries when bear farming began here in the early 1980s. Kim said South Koreans were once willing to pay between 20million to 30million won ($18,450-$27,680) to have a bear slaughtered for its bile. But farmers ran into trouble about a decade ago, when bear bile from China and Vietnam became more readily available. Now the farmers have an even bigger problem: Bear bile just isn't popular. South Korean Kim Kwang Soo, the owner of bears looks at his animals inside a cage, at his bear farm in Dangjin, south of Seoul, South Korea . South Korea imported only 2.8 kilograms (6.2 pounds) of dried forms of bear gall bladders between 2008 and 2012, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. In 2011, about 94 percent of South Koreans surveyed by the private Hangil Research Center said they had never bought bear bile and had no intention of doing so. The telephone survey of 1,000 people had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The bear farmers' association says most of its members haven't sold any bile in five or six years. Meanwhile, huge debts from feeding and maintaining the bears are mounting. Kim, who has about 270 bears at his farm, said their upkeep costs him about 300 million won ($276,750) annually. The Environment Ministry said it plans to spend about 6.2 billion won ($5.7 million) by 2016 on an anti-breeding campaign, but that no final compensation plan for farmers has been settled. Officials wouldn't elaborate but called the campaign a meaningful first step toward ending the industry. A bear stretches its snout through a cage at a bear farm in Dangjin, south of Seoul, South Korea . Kim, however, said ministry officials recently proposed that farmers receive about 1.3million won ($1,200) from the government for the sterilisation of one bear; 400,000 won ($370) annually for feed cost; and 1.5 million won ($1,390) for the slaughter of bears older than 10. Farmers say that isn't enough, and that the government should take more responsibility for their troubled businesses because officials earlier encouraged them to raise bears. The government started allowing bear imports in 1981, but Environment Ministry officials say there are no official documents showing it encouraged bear farming. Bear bile has been used in many Asian countries to treat a range of illnesses, including abscesses, hemorrhoids, epilepsy and cysts. Until recently, many South Koreans believed bear bile could cure all diseases and bolster vitality and stamina. 'It's not a panacea,' said Kim Hocheol, a Korean traditional medicine professor at Seoul's Kyung Hee University. He said there are also alternative medical ingredients that can replace bear bile, so most traditional doctors in South Korea don't suggest expensive bear parts. In China, where bear bile harvesting is legal, more than 10,000 bears are kept in farms, their cages sometimes so small that they are unable to turn around or stand on all fours, according to Animals Asia, a Hong Kong-based animal welfare group. A bear looks out from a cage at a bear farm in Dangjin, south of Seoul, South Korea . The organisation said that about 2,400 bears are illegally raised in farms in Vietnam, which outlawed the practice in 2005. As for the South Korean bears, their lives may improve little beyond their current state no matter how much government money farmers get. South Korea is trying to restore a sub-species of the moon bear, but farm bears don't count because they are likely mixed breeds. So they probably will stay in places like the Dangin farm, the largest of its kind in South Korea, as long as they live. The cages, set up just above the ground, are in varying sizes. Ten 220lb bears share a 40-square-meter (430-square-foot) enclosure, and four 290lb bears share 170 square feet. Some bears are missing a paw, or an ear. Kim, the owner, said they were attacked by bigger bears when they were cubs. Some bears are caged by themselves because they are too violent. Some bears spend their days repeatedly moving back and forth. It's a motion researchers say is triggered from the stress of being locked up in a small place.","South Korea is one of the few countries that allow the farming of bears .

When it comes to bottoms, it seems British women have decided that bigger is definitly better. A Harley Street clinic has announced a boom in the number of procedures for fat transfers to plump up the buttocks, as women strive to emulate Kim Kardashian's curvaceous figure. The Private Clinic in London has seen the number of women opting to enhance the size of their bottoms triple in just one year. Kim Kardashian's famous belfie shows the curvy star's post-baby body... that British women want . Women strive to achieve the curvy body of Kim Kardashian, pictured this week . The procedure involves injecting the derriere area with fat taken from another part of the body, such as the flanks, stomach or . thighs, making their behind fuller, more lifted and enhanced. New statistics from an online fitness and . slimming site reveal most women desire the body of celebrities famous . for their big bottoms, such as Kardashian and Kelly Brook. So it's no surprise they are opting to transform their shape and make themselves more curvy. The Private Clinic in Harley Street carried out three times as many fat transfer to the buttocks procedures in 2013 than it did in 2012. The procedure is sought both by women who feel this area of their body has sagged or lost volume but also, most commonly, by women who would prefer their buttocks to appear larger or fuller. Women typically get fat sucked out of their flanks, stomach or thighs and injected into their buttocks . Dr Dennis Wolf, Joint Medical Director . and fat transfer specialist at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, . said: 'Fat transfer to the buttocks has undoubtedly become one of the . more commonly requested treatments that I perform at The Private Clinic. 'Of all the fat transfer procedures I performed in 2012, 11 per cent of these were to the buttocks. In 2013, however, close to 20 per cent of fat transfer procedures I carried out were to the buttocks - a significant increase in a fairly short space of time.' Unlike with buttock implants, fat transfer to the buttocks is delivered under local anaesthetic and conscious sedation. The walk-in, walk-out procedure removes the requirement for general anaesthetic or a hospital stay for the patient. Dr Wolf continued: 'The relatively shorter recovery time involved in this procedure certainly makes it more appealing to many patients. 'For most women, taking long periods of time away from work to rest is simply not possible, and so the ability to undergo the procedure, leave the clinic on the same day, and return to their day-to-day activities very quickly is a huge benefit.' Kelly Brook's curvaceous body is also envied by many women . He continued: 'But I believe the procedure is also growing in popularity because of an increased awareness of the benefits and the capabilities of fat, when used to enhance or rejuvenate areas on the body. 'Fat is an entirely autologous tissue from the patient's own body. This means that it is a safe, reliable and natural substance. The possibility of rejection is, therefore, incredibly low too. 'Fat is also a very effective filler because of the longevity of results that can be achieved. In the majority of fat transfer to the buttocks procedures, the patient's buttocks will continue to appear fuller for up to 5 years, making this a long-term option.' According to a recent survey by online fitness and slimming firm DesirableBody.co.uk, the most desired celebrity body of 2013 was that of Kelly Brook, closely followed by Kim Kardashian. The survey, which asked women across the UK whose figure in the celebrity world they desired the most, revealed that the bodies of Kelly and Kim, perhaps most famous for their beautiful big bottoms, were lusted-after far and above the leaner figures of the likes of Cara Delevingne or Victoria Beckham. The procedure is requested by women women who feel they would prefer their buttocks to appear fuller . A report . out this week from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons .

They took her aside and frisked her out in the open like they do any other person singled out for a more thorough search, but Ms Steenhoek says something felt off . ‘She did a pretty invasive search,’ Ms Steenhoek recalled. ‘They are just areas of the body I’m not comfortable being touched in. On the outside of my pants she cupped my crotch. I was uncomfortable with that. ‘The part of the search that bothered most was the breast search. You could tell it shouldn’t take that much groping. To me it was as extensive as an exam from my physician — full touching and grabbing in the front. I felt uncomfortable, I felt violated.’ The agent found nothing – so they took her to a second room and did the search again. 'I don’t understand how a reasonable person would think that this behavior is acceptable,' said Steenhoek, whose daughter stood by and saw the whole thing. Whether or not investigators believed Steenhoek, they will not pursue the matter. A spokesperson for the Denver DA's office told CBS Denver that no charges will be filed. 'We would be unable to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt,' Lynn Kimbrough said. Kimbrough went on to say the DA would not be able to prove the agents conducted the search with an intent to gain gratification, arousal or abuse. It came back positive: The woman then says an explosives swab similar to this one tested positive - this is where she says the trouble began .","Jamelyn Steenhoek claimed TSA screeners sexually assaulted her during two December 26 searches in front of her 13-year-old daughter .

Thousands of rail travellers are being forced to pay double for their journeys to and from the stricken West Country as a major rail firm withdraws its ‘advance purchase’ discount tickets in the wake of storm damage chaos. But First Great Western denies ‘profiteering’ and insists the action on services West of Exeter and some connected routes was unavoidable following storms which caused the line at Dawlish in Devon to collapse into the sea. As another Atlantic storm sweeps in, Network Rail say it will take ‘at least six weeks’ to  re-open the Dawlish line. Scroll down for video . This was the scene as waves whipped up by stormy weather crashed over the train tracks on Dawlish's seaside line. Thousands of rail travellers are being forced to pay double for their journeys to and from the stricken West Country . Waves undermine the main London to Cornwall rail line, used by thousands of travellers. The route may be out of action for months while it is repaired . Railway workers inspect the main Exeter to Plymouth railway line that has been closed due to parts of it being washed away by the sea at Dawlish . The ticket move emerged after regular peak-time travellers who book well ahead for a heavily discounted ‘Advance’ ticket on a specified train found they were unable to do so. A full-price ‘Anytime’ single ticket from Penzance costs £142, while a pre-booked ‘Advance’ ticket may be half that. But First Great Western, which runs 1,500 services and carries around a quarter of a million passengers daily, said it had been forced to withdraw the discounted tickets because they applied to specific time-tabled trains. And the engineering work to  repair and restore  the storm-lashed line at Dawlish means that they cannot guarantee which services will run. So they have withdrawn the discounted book-ahead tickets until they can guarantee a ‘robust’ timetable, which is unlikely to be before next week. One regular commuter who travels . peak-time to London Paddington on a First Great Western service from . Castle Cary in Somerset with the added benefit of a senior rail discount said: ‘I get an Advance Single ticket which costs me £27.85. ‘This . morning I booked the same service for this coming Monday and found . there were no Advance Single tickets available – it was only possible to . buy a full fare ticket for £63.70. ‘Initially . I  wondered whether for some reason there was heavy demand and I had . simply left it late to book, but I checked prices for the next Monday – . February  17 -  and it is the same. No Advance Single tickets available - . only the full fare at £63.70. So effectively the fare has doubled.’ The full Anytime single- without the senior rate discount costs £96.50. A . First Great Western spokesman confirmed: ‘With damage to the rail . infrastructure at Dawlish, we have had to temporarily suspend . reservations. Put simply, we cannot sell a cheaper, time specific, . reserved seat if we are unable to guarantee the delivery of that . service. ‘Once we have a . full and robust train plan in place, to operate services west of Exeter . we will  restart sales of Advance Purchase tickets.’ However, . because the fares have to be updated in the national fares booking . system ‘these may not be available until the early part of next week’. With high tides combined with gale force winds and further heavy rain, some parts of the UK are bracing themselves for more flooding . Damage along the beach and coastline in Newquay at Towan head . He said: ’’The cost of our peak time and off peak fares has not altered since the Government's inflation-based fare increase in January. ‘Within the last two weeks however, due to Network Rail maintenance work, and latterly due to substantial damage of the railway infrastructure at Dawlish, there has been amendments to the availability of reserved, Advance Purchase tickets.’ First Great Western  said that to help customers travel during the disruption it has  removed all ticket restrictions for travel West of Exeter: ‘This allows customers with existing Advance Purchase, or off-peak tickets, to travel on any available service including peak time trains for no extra cost.’ This does not however help those passengers who want to book ahead now for a  future  discounted  peak-time Advance  on a specified service. They will have to pay full fare if they want to ensure they can get onto a peak-time train. But the rail firm did pledge to refund the tickets of anyone forced to pay full-price if a cheaper Advance  ticket subsequently becomes available:  ‘Should a customer buy an off peak fare, for example to travel next Thursday, and a cheaper Advance Purchase ticket become available on Tuesday or Wednesday, we will refund the cost of the off peak fare.' View of the railway line at Dawlish, Devon, which has been left hanging in mid-air after the sea wall was washed away . He said: ‘We hope to have a robust train plan in place over the course of the weekend. Further  poor weather prevents us from doing this on Thursday of Friday. Once we have this, we can restart sales of Advance purchase tickets.’ Services from Castle Cary are affected because that train route runs down towards Exeter and beyond to the Dawlish area, he said. Network Rail’s  route managing director for the Western route said: ‘We absolutely understand the importance of the railway to the South West and we will do everything we can to re-build the railway at Dawlish as quickly and safely as we can.’ Mike Hewitson, head of policy for consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said: ‘We appreciate the difficulties these storms have created for the rail industry. However, passengers wanting to travel to and from Devon and Cornwall are facing a double disadvantage . 'Not only do they face the delay itself, but they also have to pay much more to travel than usual. With extreme weather become more frequent the industry needs to address this issue.’","Following storms which caused line at Dawlish in Devon to collapse into sea .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:50 EST, 5 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 14:39 EST, 5 February 2014 . American Idol runner-up Clay Aiken has announced that he is running for Congress in his home state of North Carolina. The openly gay father-turned-politician launched his campaign today by releasing an emotionally-charged video where he detailed his mother's domestic abuse and his criticisms of the Congresswoman Renee Ellmers, who currently holds the seat. The entertainer talked about his work as a special education teacher, UNICEF representative and member of President Bush's commission on education. Opening up: The former singer announced his congressional candidacy in a video that was filmed at a family friends house where he and his mother lived when he was a toddler after she escaped his abusive father . 'For most Americans, there are no golden tickets- at least not like the kind you see on TV,' he says to the camera. 'More families are struggling today than at any time in our history, and here in North Carolina, we've suffered more than our share of pain.' Aiken said he examined the district's makeup for more than a year and has assembled a veteran Democratic political team. Aiken announced in 2008 that he is gay and has a 5-year-old son who was conceived through in-vitro fertilization with an older female friend. He said in an interview with the Associated Press that he doesn't believe his sexual orientation will play a role in whether or not people vote for him. 'Golden ticket': Aiken lost the 2003 American Idol crown to Ruben Studdard (L) in 2003, but both have had successful recording careers . 'There are dozens of issues that are important to the people living in the district, and that is not one of them,' he said. In the launch video, he cited Ellmer's votes in favor of military spending cuts and the federal shutdown as being harmful for the country, as well as North Carolina's 2nd District. 'I'm not a politician. I don't ever want to be one. But I do want to help bring back- at least to my corner of North Carolina- the idea that someone can go to Washington to represent all the people, whether they voted for you or not,' he said in the video. For Aiken, a Democrat, winning in the Republican-leaning District will be a challenge: Mitt Romney won 58 per cent of the vote in the district in 2012, according to a North Carolina Chamber analysis. John Davis, a longtime political researcher in North Carolina, said Aiken stands a decent chance to win the primary, but the district boundaries drawn by Republicans will make it difficult for any Democrat to win in November- particularly given his sexuality. 'It's not going to be an issue that people are going to talk openly about,' Davis said. His opponent dismissed his candidacy today by taking a swipe at his singing career. 'Apparently his performing career isnâ€™t going so well and heâ€™s bored,' Mrs Ellmers told a radio station Wednesday. Competition: Surgical nurse turned congresswoman Renee Ellmers has represented North Carolina's Second Congressional District since 2011, and Aiken says she has been bad for their community . Earlier reports that came out shortly after the rumors about his campaign began reported that he had sought the counsel of Betsy Conti, a veteran Democratic consultant. He has long-harboured political aspirations, and though they were originally just childhood dreams he has been becoming more politically active in recent years. In 2012 he told the Charlotte Observer that he had a secret desire to become North Carolina's governor. 'When I was in eighth grade, we had to do a project where we interviewed somebody we admired and wrote a paper about them,' he said. 'Everybody did a parent or their youth pastor or someone close to them. I called (then-U.S. Senator) Terry Sanfordâ€™s office in Raleigh and went and interviewed (him).' In July, he made an appearance on Capitol Hill, urging lawmakers to get tougher on anti-gay bullying. 'I was picked on, I was called gay, I was called fag, I was called sissy, you name it,' he said during a congressional briefing. 'Fortunately, I was able to overcome it and live through it because of a number of friends who were supportive of me.'","Announcement comes after months of speculation about his political interests in his home state of North Carolina .

Tragic: Coporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, hanged herself in her room at Bulford Barracks, Wiltshire in 2011 . Colleagues of a soldier, who hanged herself two years after claiming she had been raped, released a box of live crickets in her room as part of a bullying campaign, an inquest has heard. Corporal Charlotte Berrill also told the hearing in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the Army failed to investigate another soldier who acted 'unprofessionally' by telling a colleague that Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement had 'cried rape'. Cpl Ellement, 30, was found dead at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury on October 9, 2011. Her sister, Sharon Hardy, has told the inquest that she had been left 'absolutely devastated' by the decision by military investigators not to prosecute the two soldiers who she claimed had raped her in November 2009, while she was posted in Germany. Cpl Berrill said Cpl Ellement had 'desperately' applied to be posted back to the UK after she had been 'bullied' by colleagues in Germany who accused her of 'crying rape'. Cpl Berrill, who became friends with her while they were posted together in Bulford, said that Cpl Ellement would describe how she had been targeted by other female soldiers in her barracks in Germany. She said: 'She had two pet bearded dragons, at one point, shortly after the rape allegation, she left the room to use the bathroom and a box of live crickets had been released in her room and they were everywhere. 'She told me she would get bangs on the door from the girls in the corridor and she said that Charlene (Pritchard) had said she had cried rape.' She continued: 'She said to me that she was no longer her usual bubbly self, she felt she couldn’t trust anybody, she didn’t want to go out anywhere because she felt she didn’t have any friends to go out with. 'She desperately wanted to come back on a compassionate and she was happy when she got that.' Cpl Pritchard denied when she gave evidence to the court that she banged doors or said to Cpl Ellement that she had cried rape. Her colleague Corporal Charlotte Berrill also told the hearing in Salisbury, Wiltshire, that the Army failed to investigate another soldier who acted 'unprofessionally' by telling a colleague that Cpl Ellement (pictured) had 'cried rape' Cpl Berrill told the inquest that she had reprimanded a soldier, Corporal Craig O’Grady, for talking about the rape allegations at Bulford in April 2011. She said: 'I heard him saying she was a bitch and she had ruined his best friend’s life by crying rape. 'I confronted Cpl O’Grady and said that although everyone is entitled to an opinion, it’s not the kind of subject you should be talking about in a police station in front of other people who do not know what happened and you yourself do not know what happened. 'I thought is was highly unprofessional for somebody to talk about something so sensitive to people who had nothing to do with it.' She continued: 'I informed Anne-Marie about what I had heard and told her what Cpl O’Grady said, she was very upset about it and angry, she was clenching her fists a few times, her eyes welled up immediately.' Cpl Berrill said that she was then reprimanded by the regimental sergeant major for informing Cpl Ellement about the comments and relieved of her informal position of junior welfare officer. Tormented: Cpl Berill said Cpl Element (middle) had wanted to be posted back in the UK after suffering from 'bullying' in Germany . She said: 'He said I was professional and did the right thing at that stage by halting the conversation but I was unprofessional and had lost all the respect of my peers because I had told Anne-Marie what had happened.' Cpl Berrill thought 'it was not fair, ' and alleged there was 'no suggestion' the matter would be investigated. 'I knew there wasn’t anyone else she could turn to in the unit, if she lost her trust and confidence in me, she couldn’t talk to anybody,' she said. Cpl Berrill went on to say that Bulford had a 'horrible' working environment. She said: 'It’s not a very nice place, the camp itself is not in a good location, it’s isolated, it has its own weather system which makes it a more miserable place to be. 'As for the company, it wasn’t a nice place to work. Abuse: Other soldiers allegedly banged on Cpl Ellement's door (left) shouting that she had 'cried rape'. Cpl Berrill also claimed Cpl Charlene Pritchard (right) had told colleagues about the rape allegations . 'In my honest opinion, it didn’t feel comfortable, the working environment felt very seniors versus juniors, I didn’t feel like you could mix between the two.' Cpl Berrill said that Cpl Ellement was also singled out by physical training instructors who called her fat. She said: 'In several PT lessons, they would parade the fit people in one section and the unfit people, myself included, in another section. 'I can’t remember the exact words but they would say ‘the fit will be doing this PT, the sick, lame and lazy and the fat, you will be doing this PT’.' She said comments made about Cpl Ellement included: 'She was a bit fat, always downgraded.' 'In PT I heard her being treated differently, I heard the comments at PT.' Cpl Berrill said that Cpl Ellement was downgraded on her physical fitness report and that her ski-ing instructors had given her a 'hard time' on a recent trip. She said: 'I can’t recall exactly, she said to me that they had bullied her and victimised her by picking her out from the group.' Cpl Berrill told the hearing that she had been told of comments made by a superior officer on Facebook who had taken a file of Cpl Ellement’s work home to check it over. The comment, which did not name Cpl Ellement, said: 'I have seen better work from a child.' Family support: Anne Marie Ellement's sisters  Sharon Hardy (left), Khristina Swain (middle) and mother Alexandra Barritt arriving at the hearing . She said that she understood that the officer’s wife, who she believed worked as a primary school teacher, had also posted a comment on Facebook that 'the kids she teaches could do a better job.' Corporal Kareena Brooke told the inquest by phone-link from Diego Garcia that she had an argument with Cpl Ellement in the late spring of 2011 in which she was hit in the face with a bottle, although she was not injured. She said they were friends but they had been 'living in each other’s pockets too much' by the time of the incident as they had rooms facing each other in the barracks at Bulford. She said that they were in a group at a pub in Salisbury playing a game where they made each other’s drinks fizz over. She said that Cpl Ellement accidentally spilled her drink on her dress, which led to the argument in which she was hit with the bottle. Cpl Brooke said she did not know if it had been accidental or deliberate and did not make a formal complaint but did ask to move rooms. She denied that she attempted to turn people against Cpl Ellement following this incident. She said: 'I do not know why I would turn people against her. Me and Anne-Marie, we obviously didn’t get on for a while after this, she had been asking for the guys to lie for her after that night so I wasn’t happy about it. Accusations: Cpl Sarah Noteyoung leaving through the back door of the Coroner's office earlier this week. She is alleged to have vowed to make Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement's life hell after her boyfriend was accused of raping the Royal Military policewoman . 'I didn’t want to report it, I just wanted to move rooms.' Cpl Brooke told the inquest that Cpl Ellement was in a good mood when she celebrated her birthday a few days before her death. She said Cpl Ellement sang in a concert at a local village hall and they went on to a karaoke night in a pub in Amesbury. Cpl Brooke said: 'She just seemed happy and in really high spirits, like really proud.'I had never noticed if she was upset or anything that night, she seemed quite happy in herself.” Asked if she was aware of text messages sent to Cpl Ellement on the day of her death stating that her current boyfriend was ending their relationship, Cpl Brooke said: “I knew they had split, I do not know why, I cannot remember when I found out about it.' Deputy coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon Nicholas Rheinberg told the court that police had been informed of an allegation of interfering with a witness of the inquest.He said: 'The matter has been reported to the police for investigation. 'Should it be the case the culprit is discovered, it’s likely that very severe penalties would follow, not only for breaches of the criminal law but also contempt of court and, on the facts being proved, a term of imprisonment would be on the cards.'","Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement was found dead in barracks in October 2011 .

A member of one of Britain's oldest aristocratic families was today jailed for two years after repeatedly beating his wife in a series of drink- and drug-fuelled rampages over two decades. Lord Edward Somerset left his wife Caroline needing hospital treatment after bruising, scratching and pulling her hair at their home on the Badminton Estate in Gloucestershire. The attacks took place over a 22-year period, and were often motivated by arguments about the peer's addiction to alcohol and drugs including heroin and cocaine. Jailed: Lord Edward Somerset has been sentenced to two years in prison for attacking his wife Caroline . Couple: The Somersets pictured on their wedding day in 1982, before they moved to New York . Lord Somerset with his wife Caroline at Mick Jagger's 50th Birthday Party in 1993 . In 2011, Lady Caroline received an 'incredibly hard' kick to her foot after challenging her husband when he moved his new girlfriend into their home while they were still married. She was later treated in hospital after arguing with Somerset, 55, third son of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, when he took crack cocaine in front of their youngest daughter Rose. Judge Mark Horton jailed the peer for two years after he pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm at Bristol Crown Court. 'This is a case of two tragedies,' the judge said. 'A tragedy of a man born to privilege and almost limitless opportunities whose life has been marred and destroyed by an addiction to alcohol and drugs and an uncontrollable temper. 'The tragedy with which the court is concerned is the tragedy caused to your wife by you over a period of 22 years by your repeated and deliberate violence. 'You abused your position of power over your wife, not only physically but more importantly by psychological and emotional damage caused by that physical control.' Abuse: Somerset has struggled with addiction to alcohol and hard drugs including heroin . He also imposed a restraining order to protect Lady Caroline, who now lives in Australia, from her estranged husband. Divorce proceedings between the couple - who have two daughters, Francesca and Rose - are set to be finalised in the near future. Prosecuting, Eleanor Laws QC told the court: 'The couple were married for over 30 years, during which he subjected his wife to incidents of serious, repeated domestic violence.' Ms Laws said the marriage started as a 'happy one', with the 'hedonistic' couple moving to New York where they 'indulged in a party lifestyle'. The family moved to London soon after Francesca's birth, but Lady Caroline realised Somerset had a drink problem and was taking heroin. 'When she confronted him, the arguments resulted in him being violent towards her,' Ms Laws said. 'Their dysfunctional marriage continued in the same vein. 'Many of their arguments were fuelled by alcohol as it was only when she had been drinking that she had the courage to confront him about his drinking and drug use.' Home: The couple lived in Essex House on the Badminton Estate in Gloucestershire . In July 1991, the pair started arguing while on a trip to visit a friend in France. 'He reacted by dragging her across the floor and punched her to the head and body,' Ms Laws said. 'She received two black eyes, bruising to her arms and a dislocated finger that required hospital treatment.' Despite this, the couple returned to England together and moved into Essex House on the Badminton Estate, where daughter Rose was born in 1992. Three years ago, Lady Caroline underwent treatment for alcohol abuse and moved to London with Rose, returning to the Badminton Estate at weekends to see her husband. But in late 2011, Somerset began a relationship with another woman and invited her to stay at the family home during the week. 'Lady Caroline was still telling herself that she hoped things would improve,' Ms Laws said. 'She confided in friends but she could not imagine living another life. She felt protective towards her husband's family.' In November 2011, Lady Caroline was alone at Essex House with Somerset when an argument about his new girlfriend flared and he kicked his wife in the foot, making her fear she had broken a bone. Family: Badminton House, the ancestral home of Somerset's father the Duke of Beaufort . She confronted him about smoking crack in front of Rose in October 2012, and he kicked her in the ribs and punched her in the stomach. Doctors reported Lady Caroline's injuries to police, who subsequently interviewed Somerset. He told officers: 'I shouldn't do it, I know. That is what worries me, I think I could go further one day. It was all so undignified.' In a victim impact statement, Lady Caroline, who initially refused to cooperate with police, said: 'I don't know why Edward assaulted me and though he apologised, he never explained. 'I lost my confidence, my self-esteem and believed everything was my fault. I would state I have suffered enormous emotional and psychological damage.' Representing Somerset, William Clegg QC said his client estimated there no more than three periods of domestic violence in the 30-year marriage. Speaking after the case, Rob Allen of the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'This case is a reminder that domestic violence permeates all sections of our society.'","Lord Edward Somerset, 55, repeatedly attacked wife Lady Caroline when she confronted him over drug and alcohol abuse .

Innocent: Former detective Trevor Gray, pictured at Birmingham Crown Court, was cleared of rape . A former detective sergeant who was jailed for rape almost two years ago has been declared innocent after a new witness came forward. Trevor Gray, 49, was accused of raping a 43-year-old mother who invited him back to her house after a date. Despite protesting the sex was consensual, he was sent to prison for eight years - where he remained until a taxi driver who had picked him up contacted police. Gray's conviction was quashed in July last year after the new evidence came to light. The Court of Appeal, ruling that missing the witness from the original case had made the verdict 'unsafe', ordered a four-day retrial. Today a jury of nine men and three women cleared Gray unanimously of rape, attempted rape and sexual touching. Gray slammed the handling of his case by former colleagues at Nottinghamshire Police. He told the court: 'The . (police) investigation which put me in prison was a poor investigation. My life has been ruined. I've been put in prison for 13 months for . something I didn't do.' Birmingham Crown Court heard Gray, from Watnall, Nottinghamshire, had been out for drinks with the woman in Nottingham city centre on July 23, 2011, and they returned to her house in a taxi. According to the woman, she asked Gray to leave and he said he was going to hail a taxi to take him home - but he returned, breaking her door security chain and raping her while her young child slept in the house. She claimed she fell asleep and woke up with Gray naked on top of her and raping her. Gray, pictured leaving court with his ex-wife Alison Gray, said: 'The investigation which put me in prison was a poor investigation. My life has been ruined. I've been put in prison for 13 months for something I didn't do' But Gray told the jury he had been unable to hail a cab, so tried to ring the woman for help. She did not pick up so he returned to her house. When he saw her door was ajar, he thought something was wrong and broke the chain - then she told him he 'might as well stay' and initiated sex. Asked if he raped the woman, he told the court: 'I did not. The sexual activities were . consensual. She agreed to everything, she initiated everything. 'It was her suggestion to go back to her house. I was on a date, I had no expectations. She gave me a tour of the house - she was obviously very proud of the house. On trial again: Trevor Gray leaves Birmingham Crown Court yesterday before he was cleared unanimously . 'We . went back to the lounge and we sat on the settee cuddling and kissing. She suddenly said ""it's probably time to go"". I went to the door, we . kissed and I went. '[Later] I rang her phone, I send her another text asking her to get me a cab, again there was no response. 'I . rang a couple more times and got no response. At that point I felt . there was clearly something wrong. I walked back down towards the house. 'I could see the lights were on. I could see the door was ajar. 'My . levels of concern were getting higher and higher. I repeatedly rang the . doorbell with no response. I shouted through the door with no response. 'Then I made a decision to enter the premises. I used my hands on the door and pushed it open snapping the chain. 'She . was sitting up in bed. I explained to her that I had been concerned . about her. I then asked her if she could get me a taxi. 'She said ""you might as well stay now"". Everything was absolutely fine. 'I . removed my clothing, used the toilet then I got in to the bed. I was . lying in the bed, I turned away from her and after a few minutes I felt . her arm come across me. I turned inwards and we started to kiss.' Gray was suspended and later dismissed from Nottinghamshire Police after . he was jailed. His appeal to rejoin the force is still being considered and a police spokesman said it would be 'inappropriate to comment' before it is decided. Detective Superintendent Jackie Alexander, of the Professional Standards Directorate, said: 'We . take any report of sexual assault and rape extremely seriously and have . a duty to investigate such allegations, whoever they are made against. 'The . CPS considered it appropriate for this case to be prosecuted through . the criminal justice system and having been presented to a jury over . four-days they have considered the evidence and made a decision to . acquit Trevor Gray.'","Trevor Gray, 49, was jailed for eight years for rape in May 2012 .

A 22st pub landlord who was run down by thugs for trying to stop an alleged drugs deal was saved from potentially life-threatening injuries thanks to his beer belly, doctors have said. Tony Morgan, 44, the licensee of the Poachers Pocket in Chatham, Kent, was struck down when he confronted the crooks in his car park. Shocking CCTV shows the moment the suspects smashed their grey Peugeot 307 into the father-of-three, catapulting him 15ft into the air. Scroll down for the CCTV . 'I'm not having that!' This image from a CCTV camera shows pub landlord Tony Morgan (circled) confronting thugs who he suspected were trying to carry out a drugs deal in his car park . Getting his point across: As the Peugeot leaves the car park, the former boxer continues to berate the yobs . Mr Morgan had to be treated for broken ribs at Medway Maritime Hospital, where doctors told him he was saved by his beer belly. Medics said the former boxer’s excess body fat and muscle provided 'padding' which helped cushion his bones and vital organs from the impact. Doctors said a skinnier man would have been much more seriously hurt. In CCTV issued by Kent Police, Tony can be seen approaching the driver’s door and arguing with the alleged dealer. Shockingly, the driver punches Mr Morgan through the window and attempts to speed off - with Mr Morgan still clinging onto the car. But the driver then suddenly reverses - smashing into Mr Morgan - sending him flying through the air. Impact: The driver then suddenly reverses into Mr Morgan, sending him flying 15ft through the air . Hospitalised: The father-of three suffered crack ribs and bruising after landing on the concrete . The car, believed to be a hire vehicle from a London firm, was then driven off at high speed as Mr Morgan lies slumped on the ground . Mr Morgan, who has run the pub for 13 years with wife Lorraine, 45, said: 'I said ""that’s a drug deal, I’m not having that"". 'I approached as the passenger got out and said ""don’t come here to buy your drugs, do it somewhere else"". 'I heard the wheels spinning and the next thing I knew I was up in the air. It knocked me 15 or 20 feet across the car park. 'I suffered bruising and a few cracked ribs. The doctors said I was lucky - if I had been a smaller guy things would’ve been a lot worse. 'Doctors said because of my size and extra weight I have more protection for my vital organs and bones. 'I have a bit more padding then the average man which meant my bones and organ where cushioned from the impact. Doctors said Mr Morgan would have suffered far worse injuries were it not for his beer belly 'padding' around his midriff . 'I have caught people doing drug deals before. People say I should leave it to the police but I can’t just leave it. 'I would do the same again. This is my business for my customers who want to come here and enjoy themselves.' The car, believed to be a hire vehicle from a London firm, was then driven off at high speed down Walderslade Road towards Chatham, Kent. The driver is described as black, in his mid-20s, of slim build with black short hair and a thin moustache. He was wearing a green checked shirt and spoke with a West Indian accent. There was also another man in the passenger seat. The incident happened at about 12.45pm on Saturday, September 29. Kent Police are appealing for witnesses and are particularly keen to speak to the man who was in the passenger seat. DC Mark Silk said: 'This is a serious incident where the injuries could have been a great deal worse. 'Any information will be treated in the strictest confidence and we are interested in speaking to a white man in a brown tracksuit who left the vehicle prior to the incident.' A 21-year-old man from Peckham was arrested following the attack and was due to answer bail today.

Raphael and Tamar Altman were found dead on their bed and left a simple one word explanation in a diary - 'departed' The suicide of a devoted couple in a double death pact left a one word suicide note, an inquest has been told. The husband and wife were found dead in each others arms after drinking poison and leaving a simple one word explanation in a diary - 'departed'. A coroner heard that Raphael, 69, and Tamar Altman, 72, from Great Milton in Oxfordshire, were both in poor health. They had been married for more than 30 years before deciding on a death pact on October 3 last year. The couple, both campaigners for assisted dying, were found lying on their bed. Son Tai told an inquest into their deaths in Oxford: 'They were both activists with the group Dignity in Dying and believed in the right to choose. 'I grew up with it and lived with the knowledge that this was going to happen. It wasnâ€™t a shock to me and Iâ€™m more than reconciled to it.' The hearing heard that Mr Altman was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and that his wife suffered from diabetes, neuralgia and muscular pain and stiffness. In October last year the couple agreed they did not want to suffer any more. They had drunk a poison, traces of which were found in a bowl and glass by the bed. Each one left a typed note indicating their plans and a letter to their GP, Dr Lynda Ware, thanking her for years of care. They had sent an email to their two children and close friends, in which they said goodbye. Police called to the property said that the room was lit by a soft red light and there was soothing music playing. Their son, who lives in Inverness, Scotland, said: 'After Dad was diagnosed, mum was always adamant that she could not, and would not, live without him. 'She was brave enough and had conviction in her love for him to make what some people might consider the ultimate sacrifice.' The Altmans with their children, Tai and Tanyah. The man and wife were campaigners for the right to die . Mr Altman was born in Cape Town in South Africa, and had been a religious education teacher in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, before retiring. He met Tamar, originally from New York, in the UK and after five years of friendship they became a couple. They had two children, Tai and Tanyah, and ran a glass painting business for 10 years. Mr Altman carried on having chemotherapy and radiotherapy after his diagnosis until last year. As a right-to-die advocate, he gave evidence to the 2012 Government commission on assisted dying. Mr Altman wrote an article in 1999 for Radiance Magazine, a journal for larger women, in which he praised his wifeâ€™s shape, calling her his 'fat Aphrodite'. Assistant coroner Peter Clark said the couple had made a careful decision to end their lives in a 'dignified' way.

A father who drove his 4x4 into the living room of his daughter's neighbours yelling 'That's how you bang on a f***ing wall' was today spared jail. Paul Kingsman snapped after his daughter Sophie was repeatedly terrorised by Charlene Vernall, who lived next to her in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. He was handed a suspended sentence after a judge took pity on him, saying that police should have stepped in to stop the situation escalating. Free: Paul Kingsman, right, has escaped jail after driving into the home of a woman who had tormented his daughter Sophie, left . Destruction: Kingsman shouted 'That's how you bang on a f***ing wall' as he drove his 4x4 through the wall . After 23-year-old Sophie had endured five months of abuse from her neighbour, her father warned the occupants of Ms Vernall's house they had three minutes to leave. He then reversed his Cherokee Jeep into the front wall, forcing those inside to flee out of the windows at the back of the house. Kingsman, 52, then drove home in his damaged car and sat sobbing until the police arrived. The company boss pleaded guilty to affray, dangerous driving and criminal damage, but was cleared of causing damage being reckless to endanger life. Peterborough Crown Court heard that in January last year Ms Kingsman reported Ms Vernall, 25, to the RSPCA for leaving her dog unfed in the snow. Her neighbour then began a hate campaign, inviting men round to her council house for wild parties with deafening music playing until five in the morning. They would bang on Ms Kingsman's wall at all hours of the night, keeping her baby son awake until the early hours. Family: Charlene Vernall, pictured with three of her children, allegedly tormented Ms Kingsman for months . Victim: Sophie Kingsman was apparently targeted after she reported Ms Vernall to the RSPCA . 'I could hear men threatening to come round and punch me in the face,' she told the court. 'I could hear people saying they needed to go and get weapons. I was always frightened.' Ms Kingsman reported Ms Vernall to her housing association and the local police, but they did not stop the abuse. One morning in June, she rang her father while he was out shopping and complained about what was happening, prompting him to drive over to her house in a blind rage, crossing parks and footpaths on the way. Kingsman told the court: 'I took the view no one else was going to stop it. I thought if I damage that property no-one could live there. 'I lined my car up, drove through the fence and stopped. I got out and banged the door and the window and was shouting, ""You've got three minutes to get out."" 'Then I rammed the house in. When I got out I shouted: ""That's how you bang on a f***ing wall!""' The crash caused Â£14,000 worth of damage and the gaping hole left the house structurally unsafe. Trial: Kingsman and his daughter arriving at Peterborough Crown Court with other relatives last month . Accusation: Ms Vernall is alleged to have held all-night parties which disturbed Ms Kingsman . Jane Bickerstaff QC, defending, said Kingsman had been under 'severe stress' at the time due to his father suffering from Alzheimer's and difficulties with his salvage firm. Judge Sean Enright sentenced him to 18 months in prison, suspended for two years. Kingsman was also banned from driving for three years, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay the housing association Â£13,462 in compensation. The judge said: 'Your daughter was the subject of prolonged and constant abuse at the hands of her neighbour. She was not effectively supported by a number of agencies including the police and her housing association. 'It seems you were particularly close to your daughter and you decided to take direct action to put things right. 'However, I should point out what is obvious. Your obligations as a father were to contact the housing association and police to insist something was done. 'Sometimes the mechanisms in society do not work very well. But it is up to people like you to make sure these things work as they should. 'Instead, the actions you took were thuggish and selfish. You caused distress, shock and fear.' However, Mr Enright added: 'You took steps to ensure no one was in the house and were shocked when you realised there were people inside. 'It seems to me that the persecution of your daughter seems to have tipped you over the edge and led you to act in a way entirely out of character. 'You are of exemplary character, having raised a family and become an employer of around 20 people. 'In principle, custody is richly deserved. But this is one of those rare cases where the public interest is not served by a custodial sentence.'","Paul Kingsman drove vehicle through wall of Charlene Vernall because she was harassing his daughter Sophie .

A man filmed himself jumping from a 90ft bridge after downing a bottle of alcoholic ginger beer as part of the dangerous 'NekNominate' drinking craze. Rex Rickard was described as 'irresponsible and stupid' by police who rushed to the scene fearing that he was attempting to commit suicide. He posted video of the reckless jump online after the incident, admitting that the stunt was 'not clever'. The prank was part of the NekNominate trend, which sees participants down alcoholic drinks - often accompanied by other extreme feats - before nominating someone else to do the same. Leap: Rex Rickard, left, filmed himself jumping from the 90ft Wadebridge bypass bridge in Cornwall, right . Danger: Bystanders said they could barely believe he was able to survive the jump into 6ft of water . The craze has been widely condemned by safety campaigners after the deaths of two young men were linked to NekNominate. Mr Rickard, 32, drank a bottle of Crabbies alcoholic ginger beer before jumping from the Wadebridge bypass in Cornwall on Sunday. He landed in a stream which was just 6ft deep - but managed to escape with only a minor foot injury. A passing police patrol witnessed the jump and helped him out of the river, but decided not to take any further action against him. Mr Rickard, who was wearing a camera during the stunt, posted the video on his Facebook page, adding: 'Not clever! Foot really hurts. Foot's gone pretty fat.' But friends praised his reckless actions, with one saying: 'What a legend! This should go down in the history books LOL'. Drink: Mr Rickard downed a bottle of Crabbies alcoholic ginger beer then jumped off the bridge . Long way down: The daredevil admitted that the jump, part of the NekNominate craze, was 'not clever' The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global. The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world. The . concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck . your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink . Responsible'. The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet. One . popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down . the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain . bowl to lap it up. Sergeant Andy Stewart, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said he initially thought the jump was a suicide attempt, adding that he gave Mr Rickard 'strong words of advice' after the incident. Sergeant Robin Moorcroft said the prankster was 'very lucky to be alive'. He said: 'Have a laugh by all means. A bit of fun doesn't harm anybody but something like this is very irresponsible and very stupid. 'Rex is lucky because the water was only about 6-7 foot deep at the time. This certainly doesn't set an example to others on Facebook, especially teenagers.' Jennifer Brookes, a local resident who witnessed Mr Rickard's jump, said: 'Me and partner saw the man on the wrong side of the rails from my window. 'Then a police vehicle approached slowly and the bloke jumped off, the police vehicle reversed and the policeman got out, looked over the Wadebridge side and then the other. 'We saw the guy come up the bank and then he proceeded to take wet clothes off. The policeman appeared to be talking to him from the bridge rail above for about 10 minutes.

A primary school teacher has died after she was thrown off a horse in a freak riding accident. Jayne Goodwin, 44, had attempted to mount her six-year-old Freisian horse, Kali, during an evening ride with two friends in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The horse suddenly bolted before Jayne had properly mounted. She was found bleeding and unconscious on the ground just yards from the stables. Miss Goodwin suffered massive brain injuries and died three weeks after the accident when the decision was taken to switch off her life-support machine on January 29. Her friend Georgie Adkin, 20, a law student who had been riding with Jayne for seven years, said: 'Kali was Jayne’s baby, she was her pride and joy. 'She knew she was a bit flighty and spooky but she always said she wouldn’t have her any other way. 'Jayne had dismounted to open and shut the gate behind us as we were making our way back to the stables. 'Kali had got into this terrible habit of starting to move off on that final stretch as Jayne was mounting because she was eager to get back and have tea. 'So on that night she did that as usual, and Jayne even laughed as Kali started to move when she was just half on, then she went faster and Jayne said: ‘Oh Christ, she’s going’. 'Jayne was sat in the saddle but she didn’t have the right stirrup on. 'I have no idea what happened next because it was so dark. Single Jayne, 44, suffered massive brain injuries and died three weeks after the accident when the decision was taken to switch off her life-support machine. Jayne was wearing a helmet and body protector in the fall and a friend described her as 'the most safety conscious person I have met. 'I heard Jayne fall but she did not make a noise, I think that she was maybe harmed on the way down, which may explain why she had fractures to her left cheek.' Since the accident on January 9 Ms Adkin has been staying at Miss Goodwin’s home in Wakefield so she can look after and help re-home her many animals including her six cats, three dogs and three gerbils. Miss Goodwin had seven horses and six will now remain in Miss Adkin’s care at Jayne’s Springs Wood Black Horses Stables. Kali is currently being looked after at a black Freisian specialists in the Lake District. Jayne was a primary school teacher at Half Acres School in Castleford, West Yorkshire . Ms Adkin added: 'The ironic thing is Jayne knew of the dangers and was the most safety conscious person I have met. 'She always wore a body protector in case of a fall, and she was even wearing a new helmet that night. 'She was the most kind hearted person I’ve ever met. I don’t think I will ever know generosity like hers again.' Miss Goodwin, originally of Stockton-on-Tees, was a teacher at Half Acres school in Castleford, West Yorks., she is survived by her parents Audrey, 76, and Frank, 82.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan has faced mounting criticism about the introduction of Universal Credit . The government’s flagship benefits overhaul is costing £225,000 per person to introduce, new figures show. The much-delayed Universal Credit combining six benefits into one has so far cost £612million. Iain Duncan Smith once claimed 1million people be receiving the payments by April this year, but with just six months to go there were only 2,720 signed up. The Universal Credit project has suffered a series of setbacks, with ministers forced to admit the target of having all new and existing claimants on Universal Credit by 2017 will be missed. Labour claimed that if the project had stayed o track the cost per person signed up by now would be only £612. But employment minister Esther McVey revealed in response to a parliamentary question that the scheme has so far cost £615million from 2010 to 2014. This included £100million in 2011-12, £320million in 2012-13 and £192million in 2013-14. However the timescale for adding people to the hugely complex system has repeteadly slipped. Chris Bryant, Labour’s shadow welfare minister, said: ‘Iain Duncan Smith's flagship policy has been plagued with delay after delay from the outset and millions of pounds have been wasted. ‘We were once told universal credit would be on time and on budget and that a million people would be on the system by April this year, but this has come to nothing. ‘It is staggering that the government has spent £225,000 per person on this project.’ Universal Credit will combine Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and housing benefit. Whitehall's spending watchdog has said the Department for Work and Pensions failed to achieve ‘value for money’ in its development and needed to adopt ‘realistic expectations’ on the timetable for its delivery. Shake-up: Universal Credit will combine Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and housing benefit . The National Audit Office warning came after Mr Duncan Smith admitted that more than £40 million spent on IT for the project had been written off in 2012-13. A further £91million of bespoke software will become defunct when the system is operational in 2017, although the department insisted this was ‘not a write-off’. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude was forced to deny reports of a rift with Mr Duncan Smith over the project, but said its initial implementation had been ‘pretty lamentable’. Amid mounting criticism, in December Mr Duncan Smith angrily denied the scheme was in chaos, telling the Commons work and pensions committee: ‘There is no debacle on Universal Credit.’ But trouble-shooter Howard Shiplee, who was brought in this year to rescue the £2.4billion scheme, said it still faced major challenges in dealing with all but the most straightforward benefit claims. He said the automated system could not currently deal with claims involving couples or children. A tiny pilot scheme involving just 2,000 people had focused almost exclusively on young single men, whose claims are straightforward.","Universal Credit due to combine a raft of benefits into one by 2017 .

Molester: Roland Wright, 83, was jailed for eight years today after being found guilty of indecency with a child and indecent assault . A former headmaster at Nick Clegg's old prep school has been jailed for eight years for abusing his pupils. Roland Wright, 83, was convicted of assaulting five boys aged between eight and 13 at Caldicott Preparatory School between 1959 and 1970. The court heard how Wright 'used boys at a whim' by molesting and simulating sex with them at the school in Franham Royal, Buckinghamshire. He joined the school in 1952, and was headmaster from 1968 until his retirement in 1993. Mr Clegg was a student at Caldicott, which now charges fees of Â£22,000 a year, from 1974 to 1980, and was head boy. During the trial in December, the jury heard how Wright ran the school's rugby team and would have his favourite blond, blue-eyed boys who he would reward with trips in his sports car. He would also invite them into his bedsit to watch television and drink whisky. Wright was handed his prison term today despite the death of another former teacher who was due to be sentenced alongside him. Hugh Henry, 82, was found dead on Tuesday after apparently throwing himself under a train. Wright had been convicted of 10 counts of indecent assault and two counts of indecency with a child. Sentencing Wright at Amersham Crown Court today, judge Johanna Cutts told how he 'took advantage' of boys desperate for his approval and would use a bedsit next to the boys' dormitory to carry out his crimes. He said: 'I readily accept that you dedicated your life to this school. Great trust was placed in you yet you abused that trust.' '[But] far from protecting and nurturing the boys you used them at a whim - to satisfy what you wanted from them regardless of the impact on them.' Prestigious: Wright was headmaster at the prep school, which now costs Â£22,000 a year . 'Boys craved your attention and strove for your praise. From those you picked out boys for your individual sexual attentions.' His victims were aged primarily 11, 12 or 13, the Judge Cutts said, and often members of the rugby team. She said: 'Some boys felt confused, some flattered by the attention and many felt it was just what happened when you got Mr Wright's attention. 'You used the proximity of the room to the dormitories and the distance of that area from the rest of the school to set up your own little fiefdom and used it to abuse boys.' The judge said those who were abused should not feel guilt or consider they were complicit in any way. 'Appalled': Hugh Henry, 82, left, was due to be sentenced today as well, but was found dead earlier this week. Nick Clegg, right, an old boy of the school, said he was 'shocked and appalled' by the revelations when both men were found guilty in December . 'All were children in the care of an adult who had little but his own sexual gratification in mind.' Judge Cutts said that she took into account Wright's poor health, and the facts that he needs daily care and is no longer a threat to children. But she said she imposed the sentence, half of which will be spent in custody, because of the 'lasting effect' of the abuse on his former students. She said: 'I cannot ignore the impact of your behaviour on so many boys. It is clear from the impact statements that I have read that your conduct has had a lasting effect upon them.' 'Looking at the entirety of your offending the least sentence I can impose is one of eight years' imprisonment.' Wright was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register, and will be banned from working with children.","Roland Wright, 83, had been found guilty of 12 sex offences in December .
