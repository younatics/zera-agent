"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A series of bombings rocked Iraq's capital within one hour Wednesday, killing at least 95 people and wounding 563 others, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. People gather outside the Iraqi Foreign Ministry on Wednesday in a residential area in Baghdad. The six explosions marked the country's deadliest day since the United States pulled its combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns nearly two months ago and left security in the hands of the Iraqis. In one attack, a truck bomb exploded outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The blast blew through the front of the building, sending some vehicles flying and leaving others in mangled twists of metal in the area, which is just outside the restricted International Zone, also known as the Green Zone. Nearby, Iraqi security forces stood with shocked expressions as ambulances screamed past.  More photos of Baghdad's deadly day Â» . Another truck bomb went off outside the Ministry of Finance building. In central Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded on Kifa Street, and another bomb exploded in the Salhiya neighborhood, where on Tuesday security forces had avoided injuries by successfully defusing a truck bomb. Wednesday's other two bombs exploded in eastern Baghdad's Beirut Square, officials said. ""The terrorism attacks that took place today require, without a doubt, the re-evaluation of our plans and our security mechanisms to face the challenges of terrorism,"" Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said in a written statement. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Chris Hill and Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, issued a joint statement condemning the bombings. ""The horrific injuries and loss of life witnessed in Baghdad today are terrorist attacks that serve no legitimate purpose,"" they said. The attacks ""will not deter Iraqis from continuing their efforts to build a peaceful and prosperous society and engage the international community, nor will they weaken our resolve to help them in their efforts,"" they added. Two people believed to be connected to the bombings have been arrested, an official with the Iraqi army told CNN. The two suspects were driving in a car rigged with explosives before they were arrested by Iraqi Security Forces, the official said. The two suspects were believed to be al Qaeda in Iraq senior leaders, the official said. The United States pulled its combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns on June 30, leaving security responsibilities to the Iraqis. The U.S. military remains in a training and advisory capacity in those areas and continues to conduct combat operations outside cities and towns. Since then, al-Maliki has ordered his government to remove the concrete blast walls that line Baghdad's streets and surround whole neighborhoods. The order does not cover the Green Zone -- which houses Iraqi government buildings and the U.S. Embassy -- or military installations, government institutions, hotels and some private companies. The government has also removed some checkpoints, including one on the road where the bombing near the Ministry of Foreign Affairs occurred. That checkpoint had contained bomb-detection equipment.

"(CNN) -- The expulsion of a U.N. official from Sri Lanka is final and he has to leave the country by September 21, the government has told the agency. James Elder, spokesman for UNICEF in Sri Lanka has until September 21 to leave the country. Officials with the United Nations Children's Fund met with Sri Lankan officials on Monday in hopes of keeping James Elder inside the country. But Sri Lanka stood firm in its decision, and has issued UNICEF an expulsion notice for Elder, said Sarah Crowe, the agency's spokeswoman for South Asia. The Sri Lankan government has accused Elder of spreading propaganda supporting Tamil rebels. Ann Veneman, UNICEF's executive director, said the agency was ""extremely concerned and disappointed"" with the decision. ""Through Mr. Elder, UNICEF has consistently spoken out against the suffering of children on both sides of the intense hostilities earlier this year and called for their protection. UNICEF unequivocally rejects any allegation of bias,"" she said in a statement Monday night. Elder has often spoken to the media about the agency's concerns about children caught up in the country's civil war and the conditions they endure at camps for the displaced. ""Mr. Elder's role for UNICEF was to reflect how the conflict gravely impacted upon children,"" Crowe said. ""He did this based on concrete information that the United Nations attained and verified."" Crowe called Sri Lanka's allegations regarding Elder ""outrageous"" and ""contradictory."" ""They are bordering on the ludicrous,"" she said. The Sri Lankan military finally defeated the Tamil Tigers earlier this year, after a conflict that began in 1983. The rebels -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- were waging war for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka. As many as 70,000 people were killed in the conflict. In February, Elder told CNN that children as young as 4 months old were being treated in hospitals for shrapnel injuries and other wounds of war. The fighting created a ""nightmarish"" situation for civilians in the conflict zone, Elder said at the time.

"(CNN) -- At least 40 people died and 20 were injured early Thursday morning when a bus plunged into a ravine in a mountainous region near Cuzco, Peru, authorities said. The bus crashed about 5:30 a.m. near the town of Espinar, Peru, Lt. Edilberto Tunquipa of the Espinar fire department said. Interviews with survivors pointed to driver fatigue as one of the possible causes of the crash, Tunquipa said. The bus had left the city of Arequipa about seven hours earlier, heading to the town of Santo Tomas in the mountains, he said. The poor conditions of the road were another possible factor, he added. No international tourists were believed to be on the bus, though authorities could not confirm that, Tunquipa said. The 20 people injured were in hospitals, their injuries ranging from severe head and back injuries to minor scrapes, he said.  Most of the victims were believed to be locals who work in Arequipa and were returning home to their small towns for Christmas, he said. The exact number of people on the bus remained unknown. The bus holds 52 people, Tunquipa said, but it was overcrowded, with people standing in the aisle.

"The company that owns a cash depot targeted in a daring helicopter raid this week said Friday it is offering a reward of more than $1 million for information about the heist. A police Swat team enter a G4S cash depot in Vastberga, Stockholm. G4S said it is offering up to 7 million Swedish kronor ($1.01 million) for information leading directly to the arrest and conviction of the offenders or the recovery of the stolen money. G4S also said the circulation of cash in Stockholm would not be adversely affected by the heist, which occurred just days before Sweden's monthly payday, when the depot would have been rife with cash. The company did not disclose how much money had been lost, but the thieves could have gotten as much as the equivalent of several millions of U.S. dollars, according to CNN affiliate TV4. A group of heavily-armed thieves used a helicopter early Wednesday to land on the roof of the cash depot in Vastbarga, Stockholm, which serves automatic teller machines all across the capital, TV4 reported. They used explosives to get into the building, witness Bjorn Lockstrom told TV4, and later hoisted bags of money to the waiting chopper. TV4 later reported that the blueprints of the building were public documents which anybody could request to see. G4S had never asked for the blueprints to be classified. The helicopter had been stolen earlier during the night, police said. The thieves had also placed a bag marked ""bomb"" outside the police heliport, meaning Swedish police couldn't immediately pursue the thieves because they had to first deal with the bag. TV4 later reported that the bag never contained a bomb. The thieves had also blocked the roads around the cash depot with metal spikes, TV4 reported. No one was hurt during the heist, police said, even though several employees had been in the building when the robbers entered. Stockholm police said the heist had been elaborate. ""The robbery was very well planned. They brought a lot of firepower with them, among other things automatic weapons,"" Anders Bjargard from the Stockholm police, told TV4. Two people have been questioned in relation to the heist, but no one has been arrested. Police are still hopeful they will find the perpetrators. ""We have a lot of traces after the perpetrators, both where the robbery took place and where we found the helicopter,"" Bjargard said. The investigation is the biggest operation the Swedish police have mounted since the murder of Sweden's then-Foreign Minister Anna Lindh in 2003. ""It's an enormous piece of puzzle, and we don't want to miss anything,"" Anders Buren, head of police operations, told TV4. Since the heist, Swedish police have been criticized for storing their helicopters at an unguarded heliport in the Stockholm archipelago, which enabled the thieves easily to put the police helicopter out of commission. Swedish media also criticized police for not shooting at the thieves as they escaped in their helicopter. But Bengt Svensson, the head of Swedish police, defended the police officers' actions. ""Just because we now have criminals who act like they do in the movies doesn't mean that we can do it as well,"" Svensson told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.","Owners of Swedish cash depot offer Â£1M reward for information on heist .

"(CNN) -- The America's Cup is the oldest sporting trophy in the world, first held in 1851, forty-five years before the incarnation of the modern Olympic Games. The ""Auld Mug"" as it is known in the sport of sailing has attracted some of the world's most powerful men to create teams and invest millions to try and get their hands on the trophy. This month on MainSail, Shirley Robertson takes the viewer inside the world of the America's Cup, looking back to when it all started and meeting some of the major names associated with the Cup. This includes the two most successful skippers ever to compete, America's Dennis Connor and New Zealand's Russell Coutts. She also has an exclusive one to one with U.S. billionaire Larry Ellison, the man in charge of the American team, BMW Oracle Racing, who is plotting and planning how to bring the Cup back to the U.S., the nation that won every edition of the Cup from 1851 to 1983. The next America's Cup final is scheduled to be held in 2010, with Ellison and his team taking on the Defenders of the Cup, European team Alinghi. But this Cup has been a battle in the New York courts and all teams who want to compete have been locked out of the game until the head-to-head between the U.S. and Europe has been settled -- a compelling story even before the first match between the two teams has been held. When the first match takes place, it will be in the two fastest, most extreme boats ever to have competed in the America's Cup. Having already sailed the European Alinghi entry, Shirley Robertson becomes the first person in the world to have sailed both boats, as she joins the BMW Oracle Racing team in San Diego on board their spectacular multihull, and heads out for a Pacific Ocean training session.","This month, the America's Cup -- the oldest sporting trophy in the world .

"(CNN) -- Somalian supermodel Waris Dirie has graced the pages of glossy magazines and starred opposite 007 as a Bond Girl. Face for change: Dirie is a tireless campaigner against FGM. But her glamorous appearances on catwalks and in magazines and films belies the personal battles Dirie has had to overcome. Dirie is a leading voice against forced circumcision and female genital mutilation (FGM) and struggled to overcome her own circumcision at the age of five. The forthcoming film, ""Desert Flower"", based on her biography, tells her story. Yet it is through her charitable foundation that Dirie hopes that the practice still common in traditions in parts of Africa, the Middle East, South American and Asia will not create more cases similar to her own. Growing up with a nomadic family in Somalia she was one of 12 children. She fled to the London, where one of her uncles was working in the Somali embassy, to avoid an arranged marriage with an older man. She was just 13-years-old at the time. After working as a housemaid and in a McDonald's restaurant she was spotted by chance by fashion photographer Terrance Donovan and became the covergirl for the 1987 Pirelli calendar. Becoming the face of beauty products and design houses, her successful modeling career has given her a life far removed from her childhood. Yet for Dirie more importantly it has created a platform to campaign against FGM. In 2002 she created the Waris Dirie Foundation and has been given a number of honors in recognition of her work.","Somalian supermodel and human rights activist .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- At least three horses -- two yearlings and a mare -- were among the victims of the flood that inundated much of Georgia Monday. Floodwaters hit the ranch of Ed and Nancy Wellham on Monday. At least three horses died there. Jerrie Self said she called her parents, Ed and Nancy Wellham, on Sunday night to warn them to prepare their 13 horses housed in two barns and pastures on their 60-acre ranch in Powder Springs, Georgia, half an hour northwest of Atlanta. ""I told them, 'You might want to start getting your stuff out of the barns; I think it's going to get bad,"" the 40-year-old construction finance manager told CNN in a telephone interview. ""They had no idea how fast it was gonna come."" On Sunday night, Self's parents, Ed, 60, and Nancy, 59, made sure the horses were in the barns or on high ground and then went to sleep, she said. At 3 a.m. Monday, the storm awakened their son-in-law, who lives in an apartment in one of the barns. After he opened the door and 3 feet of water flooded into the apartment, he called the Wellhams and told them the horses needed to be moved.  See photos of flooding in Georgia Â» . The family scrambled, putting two horses into a trailer and hauling it to the house, then leading several show horses onto high ground behind the house, Self said. The other horses remained on two acres of unflooded pasture near Sweetwater Creek, and the family went back to the house, she said. ""They thought they'd be fine till daylight,"" she said. But when they looked out again when it was light, the horses were in neck-deep water trying to swim to safety, Self said. A neighbor said the creek had risen at the rate of 1 foot every 20 minutes. ""We all got here and we swam out the ones that could swim out,"" she said. Though they got two horses out that way, ""we thought all five babies and three mares were lost,"" she said. That turned out not to be the case. At noon Monday, they found that two of the mares had swum through the woods and made it to high ground. But they found the dead body of one of the mares and two yearlings floating in the water, and three other yearlings are unaccounted for, she said. The Wellhams, who moved to the area in the early 1980s, use their land to grow and sell hay and breed horses. Ed Wellham also owns a car-repair shop. ""My dad has lots of equipment: tractors, hay balers,"" Self said. ""Until the water goes down, we don't know what's salvageable and what isn't."" She said her parents had tried to buy flood insurance years ago, but were denied, since their land is on a flood plain. Self said her grandmother's home, which is also on the property, flooded so much that it is a total loss.","Georgia couple put their 13 horses were in barns or on high ground before flooding .

"Washington (CNN)  -- President Obama said he wouldn't pat himself on the back for his first year in office, but said Wednesday he showed he can make tough decisions that were unpopular. In a year-end interview with PBS, Obama said he was ""entirely dissatisfied"" with the high unemployment rate still facing Americans as the economic recession ends. ""I don't pat myself on the back,"" Obama said. But his administration deserved credit for making good decisions on major problems it inherited, including the recession, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other issues, he said. Without specifying any issue, Obama said he demonstrated that his administration was willing to face tough decisions. ""I think I've shown this year that I can make hard decisions, even when they're not popular,"" the president said. Last month, Obama decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan to bolster the counterinsurgency strategy favored by military commanders on the ground. The move was criticized by some fellow Democrats and favored by most Republicans. Obama also moved forward on plans to shut the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility and bring some suspected terrorists held there to a U.S. prison in Illinois. The plan has been heavily criticized by Republicans. In addition, the president made health care reform his domestic priority for 2009 and endorsed sweeping provisions contained in a bill passed by the House and on the verge of final passage by the Senate. Republican opposition to the health care legislation has been almost unanimous, and concessions made during the Senate debate have caused some Democrats to question the value of the measure scheduled for a final vote on Thursday. Obama rejected criticism from some liberals that a final bill would be too watered down, saying in the PBS interview that the bill delivered most of the benefits he listed when the debate began back in January. ""This notion that somehow this health care bill that's emerging should be grudgingly accepted by Democrats as half a loaf"" is wrong, Obama said. ""This is 95 percent of the loaf.""","President Obama looks back on first year in office .

"Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo underwent prostate surgery early Friday, his spokesman said. The surgery, which was performed at the Italian Hospital in Asuncion, had been scheduled for weeks, spokesman Augusto dos Santos told reporters. The procedure was performed under local anesthesia, the spokesman said. Lugo's doctor, Nestor Martinez, said the operation was a transurethral resection, a surgery in which an instrument is inserted into the urethra to remove a section of the prostate that is blocking urine flow. Enlarged prostates are common among men as they get older. Lugo is 58. The surgery involved nine doctors and three nurses and took about an hour, Martinez said at a news conference. Lugo arrived at the hospital at 4 a.m. ( 2 a.m. ET), was wheeled into surgery at 5 a.m. and was in the recovery room by 6 a.m., Martinez said. The Paraguayan president's office released post-surgery photos of an alert-looking Lugo chatting with doctors and nurses while lying in a hospital bed. Lugo is a former Roman Catholic bishop who has been involved in several paternity controversies in the past year. He is expected to remain in the hospital until Saturday afternoon and then recuperate for three to four days in the presidential residence, spokesman dos Santos said. Lugo will carry on a restricted agenda while recuperating, the spokesman said .

"GAALKACYO, Somalia (CNN)  -- The U.S. government is delaying ""tens of millions"" of dollars in crucial humanitarian aid over concerns that the money is being diverted to a notorious militant group, a senior U.N. official said. Al-Shabaab militants ride through Mogadishu, Somalia, after a religious gathering in September. The U.S. government, concerned about the challenges in delivering assistance in a country wracked by civil war, says allegations that Al-Shabaab is stopping aid from reaching the people are under review. Although one U.S. government source said aid continues to flow to Somalia and hasn't been suspended, another said aid might not reach ""some parts of the country"" because of Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked terror group that is trying to overthrow the government. Located in the Horn of Africa, Somalia has long been a lawless, war-ravaged nation. The United Nations says that nearly half the population is dependent on humanitarian assistance, and one in five children are acutely malnourished. Somalia has suffered through five consecutive seasons of drought, and the ongoing conflict has caused more than a million people to be displaced. Kiki Gbeho, head of office for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Somalia, said the United States is reviewing whether its aid helps fund Al-Shabaab. The U.N. office, in a report issued in September, said the U.S. delay in reaching a decision on humanitarian funding ""is already impacting on many agencies and their programmes."" The United Nations estimates that 60 percent of the people it needs to reach with emergency assistance live in areas controlled by Al-Shabaab. ""According to humanitarian principles, we have to serve people and need to deal with those in charge,"" Gbeho said. Peter Smerdon, chief spokesman for the World Food Program, the agency responsible for delivering aid to Somalia, would not comment on the U.S. funding controversy but said investigations into whether Al-Shabaab is assisted by U.N. aid assistance are ""ongoing."" Food supplies could run out for millions of Somalis in the next few weeks, according to the United Nations. The U.S. government is traditionally the biggest donor for food assistance. The issue of breakdowns in humanitarian aid in Somalia has long concerned the United States. A senior administration official and an administration official spoke about the issue on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The senior U.S. administration official said that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Transitional Federal Government President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed discussed in August how the ""delivery of services"" to the Somali people be broadened. Clinton said publicly in Nairobi that the United States continues to provide ""humanitarian assistance to the Somali people where delivery is feasible and effective."" The administration official said that the aid has never stopped, adding that food bound for the World Food Program in Somalia is on a vessel and should arrive in a few weeks. The senior administration official said, ""We are working with groups there to ensure that we can deliver assistance without having to pay off Al-Shabaab in the process. It does mean that aid may get to certain parts of the country but not others.""","Washington reviewing claims that money is being diverted to militant group .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A Moroccan man wanted for links to the Madrid train bombings in 2004 was brought to Spain from France on Wednesday, a Spanish police statement said. A photograph showing Moroccan-born suspect Said Rehou. The suspect, Said Rehou, 27, born in Casablanca, Morocco, allegedly held indoctrination sessions for Islamic militants at his former Madrid home, the statement said. ""Various individuals who participated in those meetings later were implicated directly or indirectly in the Casablanca attacks of 2003 and the March 11, 2004, attacks in Madrid,"" the statement said. The Madrid train bombings -- coordinated attacks on four morning-rush commuter trains -- killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800. Spanish courts have convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the Madrid bombings, along with four Spaniards, the latter for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. Seven other prime Islamic suspects killed themselves in an explosion as police closed in on their hideout in a Madrid suburb three weeks after the bombings. The Casablanca bombings in May 2003 killed 33 bystanders and 12 suicide bombers. Rehou is wanted in Spain for belonging to a terrorist group, and is thought to have formed part of a cell created in Spain in 2002, with the aim of recruiting fighters to carry out attacks in Morocco, Spain and other countries, the police statement said. The meetings at his home lasted six to eight hours, with the screening of videos that included sermons and scenes promoting holy war, the statement said.","Suspect Said Rehou allegedly held indoctrination sessions .

"(CNN) -- President Obama built his push for a sweeping overhaul of the health care system on the premise that reform is essential for economic recovery. President Obama has said overhauling health care is a key part of economic recovery. But with some economists saying the recession shows signs of ending, will that weaken Obama's argument? ""If the economy is picking up, then more people are going to get jobs and more people are going to have health insurance, and so they are going to be less concerned with health care reform because they will figure, 'I'm taken care of,' "" said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. But Julian Epstein, a Democratic strategist, said a recovering economy will help Obama's push for health care legislation because ""it will be a huge shot in the arm for Obama's political capital."" ""It lessens people's anxieties that are being stirred up by the opponents of health care reform. It gives credibility to the argument that government has an appropriate role to play in solving the nation's problems,"" Epstein said. Obama ran on a campaign to fix the health care system, and since taking office, the president repeatedly has tried to show how this overhaul fits into his broader economic strategy. In a speech in June before the American Medical Association, Obama warned that inaction could have dire consequences. ""Make no mistake: The cost of our health care is a threat to our economy. It is an escalating burden on our families and businesses. It is a ticking time bomb for the federal budget. And it is unsustainable for the United States of America,"" he said. While the president has said health care is his top domestic priority this year, the public seems to disagree. Eighty-three percent of people are satisfied with their current health care, and 74 percent are satisfied with their health insurance, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released last week. ""Health care reform has not been the top priority for voters. No. 1 is jobs. No. 2 is the deficit and government spending. Health care is third,"" said Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst. But Diana Owen, an associate professor of political science and director of American studies at Georgetown University, said the public isn't as concerned about the economics-driven case to overhaul health care. ""I personally think that the vast majority of the public doesn't get that connection between the economy and health care. I think they're seeing it more as a personal issue -- something that could affect them, their families, their friends,"" she said, noting that because people have an emotional involvement in the debate, the public is not likely to let it drop. That personal anxiety has manifested itself at town hall meetings across the country, where, angry protesters and other citizens have showed up to voice their doubts to their lawmakers. Voters have asked their lawmakers what reform means for them -- and how they can be assured that Obama's proposals are good ideas. The August congressional recess, however, could end up being a blessing in disguise for Democrats, Epstein said. ""It may persuade enough of them that they do need to be more moderate and incremental in the approach, and they may actually come up with a package that is even more popular than what would have otherwise been, had they tried to get the bill through before August,"" he said. If the economy recovers, plenty of Republicans and even a few Democrats will remind voters that Obama was wrong about the importance of reform to economic recovery, Schneider said. ""What will Obama say? That the recovery cannot be sustained over the long term without health care reform."" Obama sent a similar message in his radio address last weekend, citing the slightly better than expected job numbers as ""a sign that we've begun to put the brakes on this recession and that the worst may be behind us."" ""But we must do more than rescue our economy from this immediate crisis; we must rebuild it stronger than before. We must lay a new foundation for future growth and prosperity, and a key pillar of a new foundation is health insurance reform -- reform that we are now closer to achieving than ever before,"" he said. But even if the effort does take on a lower profile, it could still have real consequences for Democrats, as it did 15 years ago, Schneider said. President Clinton's push to overhaul health care failed, and the issue faded from the agenda as the economy recovered, but the ramifications were felt in the next election cycle. ""Clinton had to scale back his agenda. His big ideas for health care reform turned into protecting 'the safety net.'

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Nestle, one of the world's largest food companies, has reopened its factory in Zimbabwe after receiving assurances from the government that its business will not be interfered with again, an official with the Swiss-based company said Tuesday. The company shut its Harare factory last month, complaining of harassment by authorities after it refused to take milk supplies from a farm that had been taken over by President Robert Mugabe's family as part of his controversial land reform program. ""On the basis of the written assurances given by the Minister of Industry and Commerce of Zimbabwe to guarantee the security of Nestle management and staff and not to interfere in the company's operating processes, Nestle decided to restart the activities at its Harare factory,"" said Brinda Chiniah with Nestle Equatorial African Region's corporate communications department. ""The company reiterates its commitment to source milk exclusively from its contracted farmers,"" Chiniah's statement added. Minister of industry and commerce of Zimbabwe, Welshman Ncube, confirmed that he held meetings with Nestle management. ""I was assigned by my superiors to have meetings with them, and I assured them that their concerns will be addressed. We cannot afford to lose investors at this stage when we are rebuilding the economy,"" Ncube said. The Nestle shutdown was seen by many as a setback to the country's efforts to attract foreign investors to help shore up its battered economy. Operations were under way as normal at the Nestle plant in Harare on Tuesday. Nestle said last month its decision to shut the facility was prompted by an unannounced visit from government officials and police December 19, after which the firm was forced to accept a milk delivery from non-contracted suppliers. Two of its managers, including expatriate managing director Heath Tilley, were questioned by police and released without charge the same day. Chiniah said Nestle had been in Zimbabwe for 50 years and employs more than 200 people in the southern African nation, adding that the company was ""working with the population of Zimbabwe and striving to maintain a long-term viable operation in often challenging conditions. ""We operate in Zimbabwe, as we do in every country, through good times and bad. We work for the long-term, in a way which has positive impact on our consumers, employees and suppliers,"" Chiniah said. Nestle stopped buying milk from Gushungo Dairy Estate, owned by Mugabe's family, in October, following international criticism of a deal it had agreed to earlier in the year to use the farm as a supplier. The farm had been seized under Mugabe's controversial land reform program, which targets mainly the properties of white farmers. Critics say Mugabe's seizure of white-owned commercial farms to resettle landless black Zimbabweans -- who have no farming experience -- has ruined the country's once-prosperous economy. Mugabe, in power since independence from Great Britain in 1980, denies the charge, and says the economic crisis is due to sanctions imposed by Western nations in response to his land reform.","Factory had refused to take milk from Mugabe family farm .

"To: Interested parties From: John King, CNN chief national correspondent Re: Monday Memo . Should the U.S. expand its forces in Afghanistan? That will be the debate this week. (CNN) -- What you'll see in Washington in this week is a White House focus on health care and jobs. What you won't see -- or see much of, at any rate -- is just as critical a challenge for the administration. On Wednesday and then again on Friday, President Obama will meet with his national security team to continue deliberations about Afghanistan strategy, including whether to commit as many as 40,000 more U.S. troops to what not too long ago was ""the forgotten war"" but is now front and center. ""Ideally, it's better for military advice to come up through the chain of command,"" National Security Adviser James Jones told us Sunday when asked whether the very public request for more troops from the commanding general in Afghanistan had complicated the White House deliberations. Significantly, Jones, a retired Marine Corps general, offered what sounded like a more optimistic asssement of the security challenges in Afghanistan than the commander asking for more troops, Gen. Stanley McChrystal. ""I don't foresee the return of the Taliban,"" Jones said. As for al Qaeda and its strength within Afghanistan, Jones added: ""Very diminished. The maximum estimate is less than 100 reported operating in the country. No bases. No buildings to launch attacks on either us or our allies."" His comments left little doubt Jones is not only less than thrilled about McChrystal's public appeals, he also is among those skeptical of sending more troops. Suffice to say those private strategy meetings warrant considerable attention. Easier to see will be presidential and vice presidential events pushing health care reform and promoting the administration's stimulus plan as, contrary to what Republicans say, a cushion keeping a sluggish economy from taking an even bigger toll on American workers and families. Obama will make a new health care push Monday from the White House, joined by doctors from around the country. Vice President Joe Biden continues his role as stimulus cheerleader, from Connecticut on Monday.  Also of note: . â¢ The first new Supreme Court term of the Obama presidency kicks off, and Sonia Sotomayor gets down to official business as the nation's first Hispanic high court justice. â¢ The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday discusses potential new sanctions against Iran, proof of congressional skepticism even though Iran over the weekend agreed to let international inspectors visit its recently disclosed uranium enrichment plant. â¢ Wednesday is the eighth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Afghanistan. â¢ Wednesday also brings the Federal Reserve's latest report on consumer credit. Enjoy the week.","Obama to meet with national security team Wednesday, Friday on Afghanistan .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A new Taliban military ""code of conduct"" calls for restrictions on suicide attacks aimed at avoiding the killing of civilians, but U.S. and Afghan military officials dismissed the document as propaganda, calling it hypocritical. A Pakistani looks at a bus set on fire by Taliban militants in northwest Pakistan in June. The booklet, obtained by CNN in northwestern Pakistan, has emerged during a crucial moment in the fight between troops and militants in Afghanistan, where battles are raging in the country's Helmand province and troops work to establish stability for the upcoming presidential elections. ""Suicide attacks should be at high value and important targets because a brave son of Islam should not be used for low value and useless targets,"" the code of conduct said. ""In suicide attacks the killing of innocent people and damage to their property should be minimized."" It also says ""all mujahideen must do their best to avoid civilian deaths and injuries and damage to civilian property."" And it says that mujahideen ""should refrain"" from disfiguring of people, such as the severing of ears, nose and lips. ""Mujahideen must be well behaved, and treat the people properly, in order to get closer to the hearts of civilian Muslims,"" the code said. Lt. Cmdr. Christine Sidenstricker, U.S. military spokeswoman in Kabul, saidit was notable that the document is intended to be ""prescriptive on how the bad guys are supposed to conduct themselves.""  Watch why Taliban have brought out new code of conduct Â» . ""Their day to day actions contradict everything in it,"" Sidenstricker said. ""The long and the short of it is, they don't operate in accordance to their code of conduct."" She said more than 60 percent of civilians killed have been killed by the Taliban, and since January, more than 450 innocent Afghans have been killed and more than 1,000 others have been injured.  Watch why Taliban are proving hard to uproot Â» . Also, half the casualties resulting from roadside bombs were civilians. ""The booklet also says suicide attacks should always be done against high-ranking officials. In reality, they have killed more then 200 Afghan civilians,"" she said. Afghanistan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Zaher Azimi said the code is "" propaganda"" and that the Taliban ""will never implement that."" He cites a recent beheading of a retired Afghan soldier as a clear example of the group's real behavior. ""It was against all the laws of war,"" Azimi said. As far as the upcoming election, Azimi said, the Taliban has tried its best in the past ""to disrupt the normal process of peace and security, and they will try their best to disrupt the peace and security process in the future."" The code of conduct is dated as coming into effect on May 9, 2009. It is similar to a previous document that emerged in 2006 and covers many topics. For example, it says ""kidnapping for ransom is strictly prohibited."" As for prisoners, the code says ""it is strictly prohibited to exchange prisoners for money. Killing can only be decided by the Imam or his deputy. No one else has the right to do so."" It says an imam or his deputy are on the only ones to make decisions on whether to kill, release of exchange a captured ""military infidel."" Further, it says the practice of taking weapons from people by force ""is no longer permitted."" ""But people may hand over their weapons voluntarily,"" it said. And it says that the ""mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate should not collect donations forcibly"" and that ""people should be free to choose who they want to give to."" It said mujahideen shouldn't search peoples' homes. ""If there is a need to do this, they should get permission from authority and the search should be done in the presence of the imam of the local mosque and two elders."" The code said mujahids aren't permitted to smoke and that ""a male who has not yet grown a beard may not stay in a common sleeping area with other men."" CNN's National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said the militants ""clearly"" are aware of the need to win ""hearts and minds"" and are trying to rectify the ""mistakes"" of al Qaeda in Iraq. ""They have their own counter-insurgency strategy in winning hearts and minds,"" Bergen said. ""This is a corrective, absolutely."" He said ""there's a window for both sides to make some progress"" and the Taliban want to exploit the moment. ""The Taliban believe they are either winning or not losing. If you are an insurgent not losing is important,"" he said. CNN's Ivan Watson, Tim Schwarz and Joe Sterling and journalist Janullah Hashimzadeh contributed to this report .","Taliban issues a new code of conduct to show it is a disciplined force .

"(CNN) -- Another band of frigid weather will blanket the eastern two-thirds of the nation Wednesday, battering states already dealing with record-low temperatures that have been blamed for at least five deaths. The system will bring blistering cold weather and winds across the country, including many states not used to such temperatures. In Florida, Gov. Charlie Crist declared a state of emergency because of the threat to the state's lucrative crop industry. His order aims to help farmers across the state salvage what they can by lifting weight limits on trucks and allowing them to get already harvested crops out of the cold. In other areas of the country, low temperature records are being broken and are likely to continue to fall. Later this week, the temperature could drop below zero for the first time in St. Louis, Missouri, since 1999, according to the National Weather Center. Little Rock, Arkansas, could see an actual temperature of 10 degrees and wind chill of 20 below zero on Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service. The high temperature will be in the 20s on Thursday and Friday in Dallas, Texas, where consecutive days that cold have not happened since 1998, the weather service said. The northern Plains could see wind chills of 20 to 30 below zero through Wednesday, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""Some locations could see temperatures 30 to 40 degrees below normal"" on Thursday across parts of the Plains, upper Midwest and Ohio River Valley, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. By Friday morning, afternoon highs will struggle to make it above zero, he said. ""What's unusual about this is the length of the cold snap,"" CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said. ""Typically across the South, you'll get a two- to three-day cold snap, and then temperatures will moderate,"" he said. ""But we're getting reinforcing shot after reinforcing shot, and that pattern doesn't look like it wants to break down until at least next week."" Some states were still dealing with the aftermath of the first cold snap. In Atlantic, Iowa, a record set in 1958 was broken when the temperature dropped to minus 29 degrees Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Share your photos, video of winter weather near you . Safety officials in Virginia warned children and adults to stay away from frozen ponds and streams. A homeless man was found frozen to death in Kansas City, Missouri, where the temperature was 1 degree Tuesday morning, and Salvation Army officials said they desperately need donations of hats, gloves and socks, CNN affiliate KCTV reported. The temperature is not expected to rise above zero in Kansas City on Friday. A winter storm watch is in effect for Kansas City, where 2 to 4 inches of snow and near-blizzard conditions will be possible on Wednesday afternoon, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. A winter storm watch has also been issued for Memphis, Tennessee, where 2 to 4 inches of snow will be possible from late Wednesday evening into Thursday morning. The northern Plains could see wind chills of 20 to 30 below zero through Wednesday, Myers said. ""Some locations could see temperatures 30 to 40 degrees below normal"" on Thursday across parts of the Plains, upper Midwest and Ohio River Valley, Morris said. A winter storm warning for moderate to heavy snowfall was in effect into Tuesday afternoon in parts of northwestern Washington state, northern Idaho, Montana and northern Wyoming, the weather service said. Moderate to heavy snowfall also is possible in much of North Dakota from Tuesday to Wednesday, the weather service said. A dusting of snow will be possible in Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday, Morris said. At least four cold-related deaths have occurred in Tennessee. One was an 81-year-old Alzheimer's patient who apparently wandered outside during the night wearing nothing but a bathrobe, police said. John Anderson's body was found in his driveway Monday morning. The Salvation Army shelter in Lubbock, Texas, is making room to let more people in out of the cold, CNN affiliate KCBD reported. Shelters in Jackson, Mississippi, were reaching capacity, CNN affiliate WLBT reported. New Jerusalem Church in Jackson was opening its doors to help the homeless. ""We had one of the gentlemen tonight who lives under the bridge. ... He's never been to a shelter, and he said, 'You know, Miss Liza, my bones can't handle it anymore,' "" New Jerusalem Church spokesperson Eliza Garcia told WLBT. The frigid air reaches all the way south, jeopardizing berry and citrus crops in Louisiana and Florida. Watch how berry farmers are trying to save their plants . Some hard freeze warnings were also in effect in Louisiana and parts of the state could see temperatures drop into the 20s, some of the coldest weather in the area since 1996, CNN affiliate WWL in New Orleans, Louisiana, reported. Supplies for protecting pipes from freezing were disappearing from area stores, CNN affiliate WDSU reported. It forced some to discuss other options -- like wrapping pipes in newspaper and covering it in plastic, WDSU reported. Hard freeze warnings were in effect Tuesday morning for much of northern Florida and parts of other Gulf Coast states, according to the National Weather Service. ""For Florida, they're going to see the coldest stretch in 15 to 25 years,"" Marciano said. ""They get freezes like this, but they don't get them for this length of time, and that's the danger that will probably wear the farmers out."" In Winter Park, Florida, some students found themselves unable to escape the elements even once they got to school -- a faulty air handler left Aloma Elementary School without heat, CNN affiliate WKMG in Orlando reported. Growers are spraying water on their trees to form a protective coating of ice, said Andrew Meadows, spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual, a trade group representing about 8,000 growers. As long as temperatures don't drop below 28 degrees for more than four hours, damage should be minimal, he said. However, forecasters say colder air is on the way. ""Tonight's going to be another anxious night,"" Meadows said. ""I'm sure a lot of growers will be pulling all-nighters."" Farmers in Louisiana such as Eric Morrow told CNN affiliate WDSU in New Orleans they were also waiting anxiously, hoping their strawberry crops don't get destroyed at the height of the growing season. Charlotte County, Florida, planned to open a cold weather shelter Tuesday evening, CNN affiliate WINK reported. Other counties were taking similar steps. Shoppers at clothing stores were were clearing racks of warm coats, CNN affiliate WKMG in Orlando, Florida, reported. The cold can be lethal to Florida's tree-dwelling iguana population, too. The reptiles fall into a sort of suspended animation that mimics death when the temperature drops below 40, but they could indeed die if it stays below 40 for more than three days, according to CNN affiliate WFOR. Lows reached the teens Tuesday morning in parts of Alabama, according to the weather service. Record lows were expected in many areas across the South, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. The Weatherization Trust, a nonprofit group in Omaha, Nebraska, stepped in to help a family whose furnace quit in the midst of the freeze, CNN affiliate KETV reported. Tracy O'Boyle and her family have been using an oven to stay warm, but the nonprofit group has procured a replacement furnace, to be installed by the end of the week, KETV reported. ""We're just grateful we're going to get the furnace in a few days,"" O'Boyle told KETV. ""We've already lasted more than a week without one and it's been really cold.""

"(CNN) -- William Searing is an Eagle Scout who loves hiking, adventure, art and sports. At age 19, he's in an education program that bridges the gap from high school to getting a job. Wil has autism. Doctors diagnosed Wil Searing, 19, with autism when was 18 months old. The neurological disorder was diagnosed when he was 18 months old. Mia Newman's epilepsy and autism weren't diagnosed until she was almost 3 years old. Now 9, she and her family still face many challenges in coping with her conditions. It's been a year since the first U.N.-declared World Autism Awareness Day. In those past 365 days, nobody has discovered the cause of autism, which the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest affects one in 150 children. Nor has a cure been found. However, new research and major court decisions have emerged to explain further what may contribute to the developmental disabilities of the brain known as ""autism spectrum disorders"" or ASDs. One thing that has been known for a while is that there is not one type of autism, but rather several types under the autism umbrella, including Asperger's syndrome, classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). More and more doctors and researchers are referring to autism as autisms (plural) because each child's case is different, as are the causes, helpful therapies and potential future cures. iReport.com: Does autism touch your life? While the past year hasn't yielded definitive answers, new information about what may or may not cause autism, prevalence and accompanying issues like paying for treatment have made headlines. Here are just a few: . Do vaccines cause autism? In 1998, a theory emerged that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine caused autism, the theory being that the vaccine lingered in the gut, causing gastrointestinal problems, and that those GI problems led to autism. A few years later, the very small study that was the basis of this theory was debunked and discredited. However, this did not quash the belief among many parents that vaccines caused autism, leading them to stop or delay immunizing their children. Since the first World Autism Awareness Day last year, a couple of studies and a major court decision declared definitively that vaccines do not cause autism. In September, researchers in the United States and Europe re-created the original 1998 study, even using one of the same laboratories to analyze their results. The study authors concluded that ""no evidence"" linked the MMR vaccine to autism or the GI problems. While many experts said this study is conclusive and ""puts the issue to rest,"" some groups that hold to the belief vaccines are the cause of autism called the research flawed. Another study, published in the March 2009 issue of Pediatrics, provided an explanation of why the MMR vaccine does not cause GI problems and autism. Daniel Campbell, a researcher at Vanderbilt University, suggested that he has found a reasonable explanation for why many children also have GI problems. According to his research, a genetic variation of a protein called MET contributes to both autism and GI problems, rather than GI problems causing autism. In addition, a decision inside a courtroom rather than a laboratory drew the conclusion that the vaccines do not cause autism. On February 12, a special vaccine court ruled in three test cases, representing more than 5,000 families, that the ""combination of the thimerosal-containing vaccines and the MMR vaccine are not casual factors in the development of autism."" It's probably still too early to tell whether these rulings changed anyone's opinions. ""I don't think they were important from the standpoint of changing the minds of those with firmly held beliefs regarding vaccines,"" said Dr. Bryan King, director of child psychiatry at Seattle Children's Hospital. He said that it will not be until we find credible causes for autism that people can leave this debate behind. ""We still support research that would potentially identify small groups with underlying medical or genetic conditions who may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of vaccines,"" said Dr. Geraldine Dawson, the chief science officer of Autism Speaks, the nation's largest advocacy group. ""For the vast majority of kids, vaccines are safe and we support vaccine programs,"" Dawson said, adding that more research into vaccines is needed. Are autism rates going up? Using data from 2000 and 2002, the CDC released a report two years ago with the statistic that one in 150 8-year-olds have autism, up from the previous estimate of 1 in 166. What remains unclear is if the numbers really went up or if counting these children differently led to the increase. According to a study done by the MIND Institute at the University of California-Davis and published in January, ""The incidence of autism rose seven- to eightfold in California from the 1990s through the present."" ""The incidence of autism has not yet plateaued,"" said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, lead author of the study. ""We don't know the reason for the increase."" But she said that expanding the definition of autism and greater awareness and diagnosis alone can't account for the increase. ""Looking at the environmental cause of autism is the next logical step"" to find more answers, she said. A Danish study from December seems to suggest the opposite. It concluded that the shift in age at diagnosis, ""especially the earlier diagnosis at younger ages, artificially inflated the observance of autism in younger children."" Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a child neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, has been treating children with autism for more than 30 years. He said he's still not quite convinced that the incidence is going up either. One explanation is that the way autism cases were counted in the CDC study and in the California study are not the same. ""We need to investigate if there's a true rise,"" Wiznitzer said. What are environmental factors? In the past year, more has been said about exploring how environmental factors, in addition to genetic factors, may contribute to autism. Hertz-Picciotto said environmental factors include anything that's not in the child's DNA, from viruses and bacteria to chemicals in the brain or personal care products. She said more research needs to be done. CDC epidemiologist and autism researcher Diana Schendel said that any nongenetic factor, including a mother's illness during pregnancy or treatment of a baby in the hospital during or after birth, are other possible environmental factors. The CDC is conducting a five-year study at six sites looking at genetic and environmental risk factors for autism. Autism Speaks also said studies should look more closely at environmental factors. ""Everything from vitamin D to folic acid, a mother's health condition or pesticides"" may play a role, said Dawson. Her organization recently announced it is investing $5 million to fund studies on genetic and environmental risk factors for autism. How to afford therapies? Another issue that has gained momentum in the past year is how to pay for the therapies and treatment for children with autism and the now growing numbers of adults with autism. Elizabeth Newman, Mia's mother, is helping raise $10,000 for five families in her hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, because she knows how difficult it is to pay for treatments that helped her daughter (more information at http://www.livingthemosaic.com/ ). Wiznitzer said that one of the ongoing issues for the parents of the children he treats is ""What will we do with them as adults?"" He said there is an urgent need for developing programs for adults with autism to be productive rather than putting them in institutions. Most of the 8-year-olds who were counted in the CDC study in 2000 are now becoming young adults. However, there are few programs to help them when they are too old to receive therapies through the educational system. Dawson said she's encouraged to see the Obama administration earmark $211 million for autism research and more. According to the 2010 federal budget proposal, ""the president is committed to expanding support for individuals, families, and communities affected by ASD."" ""One of the things that Obama featured in his plan is money toward adult services,"" Dawson said. Wil's mom wants her adult son to be the best he can and the happiest he can -- but she also wants him to be a productive citizen. ""I want to get a job,"" Wil said. ""I want to be a designer -- I will have to learn how to be a designer."" He hopes to go to a college with special programs for students with disabilities. He's already designed business cards for a few people; his mom hopes this might be something he could do professionally in the future. Aside from doing the morally right thing, Jane Searing said, funding more programs for adults with autism makes economic sense. ""If you get them employed, you won't have to pay for them forever,"" Searing said, adding it's much better to ""turn these people into taxpayers instead of tax takers.""","Thursday is second World Autism Awareness Day .

General Assembly is in session, and so is this edition of CNN Student News. Bringing you today's commercial-free headlines, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Leaders Talk Climate Change . AZUZ: First up, representatives from nearly 200 countries come together in New York to talk about global issues. This is called the United Nations General Assembly, and the decisions and resolutions that it makes set the agenda for a lot of what the U.N. works on throughout the year. One of the biggest focuses for this gathering is climate change. Secretary General Ban ki Moon calls it one of the most important issues of the 21st century. He's hoping that countries will work on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to climate change. During speeches yesterday, President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao, who lead the countries that give off the most greenhouse gases, pledged to try to reduce them. Neither leader offered a specific timeframe for this, but both said they plan to cut greenhouse gases and increase the use of clean energy sources. President Obama also touched on another controversial issue yesterday: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Peace talks between the two groups have fizzled out recently, but Obama is urging both sides to come back to the negotiating table and work on a permanent solution. He met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday in an effort to restart discussions between these two. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Despite all the mistrust, we have to find a way forward. We have to summon the will to break the deadlock that has trapped generations of Israelis and Palestinians in an endless cycle of conflict and suffering. Spoken Word . SONNY PERDUE, GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA: This has been a 48-hour ordeal that people had been, stayed here and to care for the safety of people. I just want to thank them. I want to thank those firefighters and first responders all across Georgia, from the east and Stevens county, to the west in Paulding and Carroll and Douglas, and in Cherokee in northwest Georgia. This has been a huge effort. Southeast Flooding . AZUZ: Okay, that was Georgia's Gov. Sonny Perdue there, talking about severe flooding that has led to at least eight deaths. Noting that nearly all of those were from drivers and passengers who were swept away by floodwaters, Gov. Perdue pleaded with residents to stay off the roads until the waters recede. Yesterday, he planned to ask President Obama to declare a federal emergency in order to free up money that would help with the relief efforts. With flash flood watches stretching across parts of the southeastern U.S., Rob Marciano examines the impact of this severe weather. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROB MARCIANO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: It's a cruel irony. After months of drought, heavy rains spawning deadly floods. Across much of the southeast, streets are covered. Homes are destroyed. Tranquil creeks now on a rampage. In some places near Atlanta, nearly two feet of rain fell. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the highest water that I've seen, and I've been living around here all my life. MARCIANO: This couple was rescued by boat in the pitch black. They had to use flashlights to see. And the only thing they could bring with them: their dog and a few family treasures. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These are my wedding pictures. MARCIANO: But they were luckier than others, others who lost something so much more dear. In Georgia, right now, 17 counties under a state of emergency. Officials say they're in rescue and recovery mode, but those rescues, especially around Atlanta, have been slow and difficult. Pictures showing just how crippled some areas of the city are. In the western suburb of Powder Springs, a house is left to burn. Next to it, a fire truck stranded, helpless in the rising floodwaters. These two men had to get around on inflatable mattresses, and so many people are stunned by what they're seeing. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right now, shock. I don't think it's really set in that this is real. This is, we're flooded out. We don't have a home. MARCIANO: Rob Marciano, CNN, Austell, Georgia. (END VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ: For another perspective, look at this! This is the amusement park, Six Flags over Georgia and under water. It's located west of Atlanta, and what you're seeing here is a coaster called the Scream Machine. I think I've ridden this thing every time I've been to Six Flags.

MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a Central American nation located between Guatemala and Nicaragua. I gained my independence from Spain in 1821. My capital city is Tegucigalpa. I'm Honduras, and I'm home to about 7.8 million people. Ousted President . AZUZ: Political turmoil has led to clashes in that capital city, all based around Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya. He was actually removed from office back in June and faces charges of violating the country's constitution. Zelaya, who's in the white hat in the middle of your screen here, returned to Honduras Monday. He took up refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa. If he leaves, the Honduran government says it will arrest him. The Brazilian embassy isn't considered part of Honduras, so Zelaya can't be arrested as long as he stays inside. Police and soldiers positioned outside the embassy clashed with Zelaya's supporters before clearing the area yesterday. The situation has led the U.S. to close its embassy in the Honduran capital. Troops in Afghanistan . AZUZ: Meantime, the president of Afghanistan says he supports a top U.S. commander's call to increase the number of U.S. troops in the Asian country. President Hamid Karzai called it ""the right approach."" But it's certainly not the only one. As Barbara Starr explains, there are several ideas on how to fight the war in Afghanistan, and who that war should be against. (BEGIN VIDEO) BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: As violence increases daily in Afghanistan, some are calling for a major troop build-up. The president signaling when he ordered a review of the Afghan war, he wasn't anxious to quickly send tens of thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban insurgency. OBAMA: Let's do a soup-to-nuts re-evaluation, focusing on what our original goal was, which was to get al Qaeda, the people who killed 3,000 Americans. STARR: Attacking al Qaeda is fundamentally a counter-terrorism strategy, requiring a limited number of new troops. It's the ""Plan B"" advocated by some in the White House, according to a senior Pentagon official. But Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top commander, is still calling for a counterinsurgency strategy to strengthen Afghanistan to the point the Taliban have no safe haven there. That could take tens of thousands of more troops beyond the 68,000 now planned. Retired Gen. Montgomery Meigs says it's a must. GEN. MONTGOMERY MEIGS (RET.), U.S. ARMY: If you're going to get the tribes over on your side and the side of government, you have to have enough people there to make things happen for them, economically, socially and in terms of security. STARR: Could the Pentagon put U.S. firepower, such as fighter jets and drones, in neighboring countries to reduce the U.S. presence inside Afghanistan? MEIGS: My point is, if you don't have the kind of intelligence you need to make those systems effective, you are going to swing and miss a lot. STARR: The powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Service committee says more U.S. troops right away are not the answer for another reason. SEN. CARL LEVIN (D-MI), CHAIRMAN, ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: I've been recommending to the president that, first of all, before any consideration is made of additional combat forces, that we get the Afghan army bigger, better equipped. STARR: The new bottom line? Support for the war in Afghanistan is declining, and the president and his commanders will have to make the case for whatever comes next. Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Retired Army Spc. Scott Winkler had many scary encounters while serving in Iraq, but they were nothing compared with his recent experience at the world's largest aquarium: swimming alongside a massive whale shark. Ret. Army Spc. Scott Winkler, 35, was paralyzed five years ago during an accident in Iraq. The fact that Winkler, 35, of Augusta, Georgia, is a paraplegic made the once-in-a-lifetime experience even more challenging. ""It's like you're in space,"" Winkler said. ""It's like you're an able body again. It makes you feel so free."" Winkler was paralyzed five years ago during an accident while unloading ammunition in Tikrit, Iraq. He is one of more than two dozen disabled veterans who have participated in the Fish Wish program at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta during the past two months. A separate swim and dive program is open to the public, but the waiting list is nearly full until the end of the year. The experience isn't cheap. A half-hour dive costs $290. The veterans swam for free. Therapeutic recreational specialist Susan Oglesby helps train safety divers at the aquarium to assist swimmers with disabilities. She explained there are very few limitations in the tank. Watch more on veterans swimming with sharks Â» . ""The water is the great equalizer. Once you get in, you're floating, you're weightless, and everybody becomes equal,"" Oglesby said. Winkler was outfitted in a wet suit and snorkeling gear. He rolled his wheelchair down a long ramp to a dock floating in the 6.3 million-gallon tank of salt water. After sliding out of the chair, he took a deep breath and pushed himself into the water. ""It is so amazing, he said. ""It's like you don't have a disability, because you're just floating around with everybody else. ... The fish are just swimming by. It's a total other world."" In addition to four 23-foot-long whale sharks, Winkler gazed on a manta ray, hammerhead sharks, goliath grouper and sawfish. He used his arms to move his body around the football-field-size tank. Swimming next to him were two safety divers and Orlando Perez, another young veteran from Augusta. ""It's beautiful down there!"" Perez exclaimed. ""It's peaceful, and you just forget that you're in a wheelchair. You're one with the fish."" Perez, 33, a retired Army private first class, suffered a spinal cord injury during basic training 13 years ago. Like Winkler, he is confined to a wheelchair. Perez likened the swim experience to floating on air. ""I never thought being disabled would bring me to do something so amazing,"" he said. ""I think it's about overcoming the disability and not letting the disability overcome you."" Both Perez and Winkler admitted they were nervous when they first entered in the water. They settled down after being brushed by one of the passing whale sharks. Winkler had a big grin on his face as he talked about the benefits of taking part in the program. ""Mentally, you're actually taking a stress break from life itself,"" he said. ""Physically, it's great rehabilitation. Emotionally, your spirit is lifted, and you're able to enjoy yourself for once.""","Fish Wish program allows veterans with disabilities to swim with sharks .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It's the middle of the night and Steven Ford is wide awake. Insomniac Steven Ford says he needs to find a better way to wind down after a long day on the job. ""I toss and turn and watch the clock, sometimes at 3 in the morning, 2 in the morning,"" lamented Ford, 44, a commercial sign installer in Atlanta, Georgia. Valerie McCloskey, a 42-year-old mother of two from Grand Rapids, Michigan, complained of a similar problem. ""My husband is sound asleep next to me and I'm thinking about everything that I'm worried about."" McCloskey and Ford are among a huge group of Americans who suffer from some type of insomnia. ""Sleep problems are very, very common,"" explained Dr. David Schulman, director of the Sleep Laboratory at Emory University in Atlanta. ""They affect more than a third of Americans in a given year.""  Health Minute: Watch more on sleep disorders Â» . Sleep problems may be common, but Schulman stressed that insomnia is not normal if it lasts more than a month or two. He said most adults need about eight hours of sleep a night. In reality ""the average American sleeps just under seven hours,"" he said. ""That's a problem."" A persistent lack of sleep or poor quality sleep can leave you feeling exhausted when you wake up. ""These folks are walking zombies,"" Schulman said. ""They are out there with four or five hours of sleep a night."" Long-term sleep problems also may exacerbate other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension, experts say. Before you can treat the problem, you probably need to figure out what kind of insomnia you're dealing with. The condition is classified as primary or secondary. The latter means that a patient may be having trouble sleeping because of a health condition or medication. Primary insomnia is not related to any side effects. It is considered its own disorder that can be broken down into two groups: sleep-onset insomnia and sleep-maintenance insomnia. Like its name, the sleep-onset version occurs in the beginning of the night when someone tries to fall asleep and can't. ""Sleep-maintenance insomnia is much less common,"" Schulman said. ""It occurs when somebody can go to sleep, but wakes up once or several times throughout the night and has difficulty resuming sleep."" Stress, anxiety and depression may be some of the causes of chronic insomnia. Before he prescribes medications, Schulman typically suggests that his patients try a number of things to regain control of their sleep cycle. First, he said, don't stay in bed for longer than 20 to 30 minutes if you can't fall asleep or fall back asleep. ""If you accustom your body to being in bed for hours at a time unable to fall asleep, that behavior to some degree becomes subconsciously ingrained,"" he said. Avoid caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime. Studies show that ""if you take caffeine at noon it's still in your system at 8 or 10 at night,"" Schulman said. Don't eat or exercise within three hours of bedtime. Schulman said both detract from sleep. He also suggested avoiding alcohol before bedtime because it might trigger a lighter sleep and make it more likely you'll wake up in the middle of the night. Finally, he recommended finding light, relaxing activities that will induce sleep, such as reading or listening to soft music. He cautioned insomniacs to avoid bright light before bedtime. He also warned against watching television and using video games and computers before turning out the lights. Cooling off might help. ""One of the ways you can fool your body into thinking it is cooling off is to heat it up just before bedtime,"" Schulman said. ""Take a warm bath or shower 30 to 45 minutes before going to sleep. As your body cools off afterwards, it is very sleep-inducing."" Steven Ford admitted he needs to find a better way to wind down after a long day on the job. He doesn't consider his problem to be serious enough yet to see a doctor, adding ""I'm too manly to try to look for help. I just deal with it, go to work and wait for the weekend.""","Sleep problems affect more than a third of Americans in a given year, expert says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- All Lyle Petersen wanted to do was get his mail. Lyle Petersen,  a CDC expert who was infected with West Nile virus, says, ""it will ruin your summer."" In the time it took him to walk down his driveway in Fort Collins, Colorado, chat briefly with a neighbor and return to his house, Petersen got infected with a potentially serious mosquito-borne illness called West Nile virus. Within hours of being bitten, he said, he began to feel symptoms he recognized. And how was he sure so quickly? Petersen, as director of the division of vector borne diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is one of the foremost experts in the world on the condition. A blood test confirmed his suspicion. ""From my own experience, I can tell you it's not a very mild illness,"" Petersen cautioned. ""It will ruin your summer."" Experts are expecting another epidemic of the disease this summer. The incidence of West Nile virus has remained the same for the past four years, and Petersen says he doesn't expect this year to be any different. It should reach its peak between mid-July and mid-September.  Health Minute: More on West Nile virus risk Â» . ""People tend to discount this as a significant problem,"" Petersen said, ""but more than 1.5 million people have been infected so far in the United States, and about 300,000 have had West Nile fever."" West Nile virus emerged in the U.S. nine years ago. The virus is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes contract the illness by feeding on infected birds. The CDC reported that in rare cases, West Nile virus has spread through blood transfusions, organ transplants and breastfeeding. The disease is not spread through casual contact. The symptoms range from mild to severe and typically develop between three and 14 days after a person is bitten.  Explainer: West Nile 101 Â» . Debbie Koma, a 50-year old hairdresser from Atlanta, Georgia, developed West Nile virus two years ago. She described it as ""unlike anything that I ever had before. I was sick as a dog."" She recalled being hospitalized for three days with a high fever, a horrible headache and body aches. After 14 days, she was strong enough to get out of bed, but she says her strength didn't fully return for three months. Petersen had a similar experience when he was stricken five years ago. ""I discovered I had West Nile virus because I am a long-distance runner,"" he said. ""About halfway through one of my runs, I felt terrible. Within a couple of hours, I was lying in bed with severe headaches, eye pain, muscle pain and fever, which lasted about a week. I basically couldn't get out of bed for a week."" It wasn't just Petersen who became sick, but his daughter and the neighbor were complaining of West Nile virus symptoms hours after being swarmed by mosquitoes at the mailbox. A medical doctor, Petersen actually tested his own blood in the laboratory and diagnosed his own illness. Like Koma, he was sick for a couple of months. His chief symptom: severe fatigue. ""I could barely walk up the stairs,"" he said. ""This is not a mild illness, and people should try to avoid it."" Petersen mentioned that some patients with West Nile virus can develop a severe neurological disease that can be fatal. There is no effective treatment for the virus. In more serious cases, the CDC recommends that patients be hospitalized so they can receive supportive care with intravenous fluids. Researchers are working to develop a vaccine, but Petersen notes that it will be years before it is available to humans. The best way to stop the spread of West Nile virus is through prevention, he said. ""Wear mosquito repellent, especially around dawn and dusk, which are peak mosquito biting times,"" Petersen suggests. He says bug sprays that contain concentrations of the chemical DEET up to 50 percent work the best. Be sure to read the label or check with a doctor regarding the acceptable concentrations for children. Spraying repellent that contains permethrin on clothing is another option. Experts caution not to put the chemical directly on exposed skin. Petersen added that a natural product such as oil of lemon eucalyptus CQ may also be effective. The CDC says vitamin B and ultrasonic devices do not work in preventing mosquito bites. Another way to reduce the risk of getting bitten by a mosquito is to get rid of standing bodies of water around the house, Petersen said. ""The mosquitoes that spread West Nile virus often breed around people's homes in small containers like flower pots, rain barrels and bird baths,"" he explained. Even by taking precautions, Petersen concluded, the disease won't be eradicated in the U.S. anytime soon. ""I think West Nile virus is here to stay, and I can't tell you how many cases will occur this summer, but there will be epidemics.""","More than 1.5 million people have been infected in the U.S.

"LOGANVILLE, Georgia (CNN) -- The crowd cheered as Morgan Lawless faced her first pitch of the fall baseball season. Morgan Lawless, who has cerebral palsy, plays baseball at Bay Creek Park near Atlanta, Georgia. The 14-year-old middle-school student clenched her teeth as she swung the bat into a single. Instead of running to first base, Lawless zoomed over in her motorized wheelchair. Lawless has cerebral palsy. She's among nearly 300 children who play in a special-needs baseball league at Bay Creek Park in the Atlanta, Georgia, suburb of Loganville. ""It's actually fun because we get to be kids and we can play like regular people,"" Lawless said. What's different about this ballpark is that the field is made of a rubberized material that allows for easier movement in wheelchairs. ""We started out on a dirt field,"" said league founder Cathy Smith. ""But power wheelchairs and dirt don't mix."" Smith helped raise some of the half-million dollars in private and county funding needed to build the field in 2004. She said she gets goosebumps whenever she watches the young players come across home plate. ""The grin and smile on their faces just says it all."" Coach Tom Estes joined the program eight years ago with his now-15-year-old son, Justin, who has cerebral palsy. Estes noted that some of the players, like his son, use a wheelchair, but others with autism, Down syndrome and multiple sclerosis are ambulatory.  Health Minute: Watch more on special needs baseball Â» . During a game, the children are paired with young helpers from another local baseball league. No special skills are required to participate, Estes said. ""If we have to help them hit, help them run, help them catch, we are simply here to let them play baseball."" The coaches have taken extra precautions to make sure no one gets hurt. The players wear batting helmets, and a coach feeds large, softball-sized rubber balls into a pitching machine to control the direction. There are no umpires, and no one really keeps score. ""We have a lot of tie ball games,"" Estes chuckled. The games are short, just two innings, but everyone gets to play. ""It's not about competition as much as it is about the ability to just do what other kids do,"" said Mike Lawless, Morgan's father. He said his daughter looks forward to the games all week. So does Estes' son. ""Until you get involved, you don't realize the closed life they live,"" Tom Estes said. Being part of the team gives the players a sense of independence and self control and gets them outside in the fresh air, he said. ""They're out here doing the same thing as the other kids. They really don't do that on a normal basis."" The weekly games also give the kids something to brag about in school on Monday morning, Estes said. ""They hear everyone else talking about it...and my son can say, 'Yeah, I hit a home run yesterday, too. It was great.' "" Justin Estes seemed to take all the attention in stride. And what does he think is the best part about playing baseball? Pointing past his wheelchair to the smooth surface of the field, he said simply, ""No ruts.""","Special-needs baseball league near Atlanta has nearly 300 children .

"(CNN)  -- President Obama has ordered a review of security screening processes after Friday's botched terror attack on a U.S. airliner, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday. Appearing on the ABC program ""This Week"" and the NBC program ""Meet the Press,"" Gibbs said Obama is receiving regular briefings by his national security staff on the incident in which a suspect allegedly tried to detonate an explosive device on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, making its final approach to Detroit, Michigan. The suspect, 23-year-old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was on a broad watch list of 550,000 names since last month, Gibbs said. That list does not automatically bring tighter screening of individuals, Gibbs said, and Obama has ordered a review of the procedures for determining which people on the list undergo more stringent checking. Obama also called for ""a review to ... figure out why an individual with the chemical explosive he had on him could get on a plane in Amsterdam and fly into the United States,"" Gibbs said on NBC. ""The president is very confident that this government is taking the steps that are necessary to take our fight to those who seek to do us harm,"" Gibbs said on the ABC program. Authorities on Sunday focused their investigation on how a lone traveler smuggled explosives aboard the Northwest Airlines flight and who might have helped him. Abdulmutallab, who had a multiple entry visa to the United States, was charged Saturday in a federal criminal complaint. Q&A: Why did security checks fail to spot explosives . People on the flight described a chaotic scene that began with a popping sound followed by flames erupting at Abdulmutallab's seat. Jasper Schuringa, a Dutch passenger on the flight from Amsterdam, leaped across the aisle to grab the suspect, who according to authorities suffered burns on his legs. Schuringa told CNN he saw that Abdulmutallab was holding a burning object between his legs. ""I pulled the object from him and tried to extinguish the fire with my hands and threw it away,"" Schuringa said. He said he heard fire extinguishers as he pulled Abdulmutallab out of his seat and dragged him to the front of the plane. In Nigeria, Abdulmutallab checked no baggage on his trip that originated in Lagos on a KLM flight to Amsterdam, where he changed planes to the Northwest flight, according to Harold Demuren, director-general of Nigeria's Civil Aviation Authority. The suspect had a shoulder bag and went through the normal check-in process with his passport and U.S. visa scanned, Demuren said Sunday. The multiple-entry U.S. visa was issued in London, England, in June 2008 with an expiration date of June 2010, Demuren said. Abdulmutallab then passed through a walk-through metal detector and put his shoulder bag through an X-ray screening machine, Demuren said. He also said the suspect underwent secondary screening at the boarding gate for the KLM flight, according to officials of the Dutch airline. The father of the suspect recently contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria with concerns his son was planning something, a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday. The father -- identified by a family source as Umaru Abdulmutallab -- contacted the embassy ""a few weeks ago"" saying his son, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had ""become radicalized,"" the senior administration official, who is familiar with the case, told CNN. A family source told CNN that the elder Abdulmutallab -- who recently retired as chairman of First Bank PLC, one of Nigeria's premier banks -- had contacted the embassy in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, and various other security agencies earlier than the timeline provided by the administration official. The family source said Abdulmutallab went to those agencies about three months ago after receiving a text message from his son. The source, who lives at the family home in Kaduna in northern Nigeria, said the son informed his family in the text message that he was leaving school in Dubai to move to Yemen. He implied that he was leaving ""for the course of Islam."" The family member said Abdulmutallab ""had no family consent or support,"" adding he ""absconded to Yemen."" Abdulmutallab's information about his son was forwarded to the National Counter-Terrorism Center, and Abdulmutallab was added to a general watch list, a senior administration official said. But the official said ""the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no-fly list."" In addition, the official said there was ""no derogatory information that would have prevented him from getting a visa"" back in June 2008. A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation into Abdulmutallab said investigators are still trying to trace his past travels. ""Investigators are looking into any al Qaeda connections and whether he had help and training from Yemen,"" the law enforcement official said. A preliminary FBI analysis found that the device on the plane contained PETN, also known as Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate, a highly explosive chemical compound. In addition, FBI agents recovered what appear to be remnants of a syringe near Abdulmutallab's seat, believed to have been part of the device. The family source said Abdulmutallab received a college degree at the University College London, where spokesman Dave Weston said a man named Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab was enrolled in the mechanical engineering department between September 2005 and June 2008. When Abdulmutallab returned to Nigeria from London, he told his family he wanted to get a second college degree in Cairo, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia, the family source said. The family refused because they were worried that he may have developed ties to some dubious people. He went to Dubai instead, the source said, where he sent a text message saying he had gone to Yemen to start a new life and that it would be difficult for anyone to reach him because he had thrown away his SIM card. Abdulmutallab's father notified the U.S. Embassy with information on his son, saying the family feared he went to Yemen to participate in ""some kind of jihad."" A federal security bulletin obtained by CNN said Abdulmutallab claimed the explosive device used Friday ""was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used."" Yemeni authorities have yet to receive official information on the terror attempt, according to a Yemeni official who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. But, the source said the country's government will take immediate action once the attempted bombing suspect's alleged link to the country is officially identified. Earlier Saturday, the Netherlands' national coordinator for counterterrorism told CNN that Abdulmutallab had gone through ""normal security procedures"" in Amsterdam before boarding the flight and those were ""well-performed."" The initial impression is that the suspect was acting alone and did not have any formal connections to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. administration official said. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, said the attempted act of terrorism would be the focus of an oversight hearing next month. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, also said his Senate Commerce Committee would hold a hearing on the incident. In Nigeria, the government said Saturday that it ""received with dismay the news of attempted terrorist attack on a U.S. airline"" and has ordered its security agencies to investigate the incident. Officials from the Nigerian Embassy in Washington have flown to Michigan ""to gain Consular access"" to Abdulmutallab, the embassy said in a statement Saturday. The embassy said it plans to cooperate with U.S. authorities. An official with the Transportation Security Administration told CNN there will be increased security measures taken on international flights to the United States. The official advised travelers to allow for extra time before the flight. There will be no change in the number of carry-on bags allowed. CNN's Elise Labott, Jeanne Meserve, Carol Cratty, Richard Quest and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","President Obama calls for review on how chemicals got on plane .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday extended permission for hundreds of pilots to carry firearms -- just hours before their certification to carry the weapons was to expire, according to an organization which represents the pilots. ""A few hundred"" Federal Flight Deck Officers -- or FFDOs -- were to lose their certification to carry firearms effective midnight on New Year's Eve, said Mike Karn, executive vice president of the Federal Flight Deck Officer Association. The loss would have come at a time of heightened concern about air security because of the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas Day. But Karn said the DHS's Federal Air Marshal program notified him Thursday afternoon that the pilots' certification would be extended. A Transportation Security Administration official confirmed that certifications had been extended for six months ""in light of recent events."" The official said that ""due to an internal miscommunication, scheduled notifications to these officers were prematurely issued,"" but he offered no further explanation. FFDOs are commercial pilots who volunteer to undergo training so they can carry weapons to protect their aircraft. They undergo initial training at federal law enforcement training academies and must re-qualify with firearms every six months, and undergo a two-day recurrent training every three to five years. ""I'm grateful [for the extension] because that will keep the most cost-effective last line of defense [of aircraft] in place,"" Karn said. ""But I'm still concerned that such a limited budget has been approved for this program, and volunteers who want to protect the American public will be turned away."" Karn said the budget for the program has not increased since 2003, effectively capping the number of armed pilots. The exact number of FFDOs is classified, but government officials have said in the past the number greatly exceeds the number of federal air marshals -- plain-clothed officers who fly in the cabin of the plane to protect aircraft. Several FFDOs contacted by CNN said DHS has made getting recurrent training onerous for pilots, limiting the number and sizes of classes. Pilots also must pay for their own hotels and food during training -- ""our own time and our own dime,"" said one pilot -- placing a further burden on them. Had the loss of certification occurred, it would not have affected the pilots' flight clearance, only their ability to carry weapons.","Federal Flight Deck Officers were to lose certification effective midnight tonight .

"(CNN) -- In the second such incident in three days, fighter jets escorted a diverted commercial flight on Friday after an unruly passenger caused alarm onboard. The military sent up two F-16s in response to reports of an unruly passenger aboard AirTran Flight 39, the North American Aerospace Defense Command  said in a statement. The passenger had become belligerent and refused to leave the restroom, airline spokesman Tad Hutcheson told CNN on Friday. The passenger appeared to be intoxicated, he said. The flight, bound for San Francisco, California, left Atlanta, Georgia, at 9:48 a.m. ET, according to AirTran's Web site. NORAD dispatched the fighters at 1:44 p.m. ET, escorting the aircraft to a safe emergency landing in Colorado Springs, Colorado, officials said. The passenger was detained there and FBI agents from Denver, Colorado, were called to question passengers, Hutcheson said. The other passengers were scheduled to continue their trip at 4:30 p.m. ET, he said. On Wednesday, NORAD escorted a Hawaii-bound plane back to its origination city of Portland, Oregon, after a passenger gave a flight attendant a note that was interpreted as being threatening, the federal complaint and supporting affidavit said Friday. The passenger, Joseph Hedlund Johnson, 56, told the FBI he hadn't intended to scare anyone with the note, which began, ""I thought I was going to die,"" and referenced the television show ""Gilligan's Island.""","NORAD: Two F-16s dispatched Friday on reports of unruly passenger aboard AirTran flight .

"ALPHARETTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Soft music filled the room as waiters served white wine and hors d'oeuvres. Two dozen well-dressed women chatted in small groups. Mary Johnson, 56, who lost most of her lashes during chemotherapy, was excited to give Latisse a try. But, this was no ordinary cocktail party. The setting was the lobby of the OH2 Medical Spa in Alpharetta, Georgia. The women were on hand to take part in a new beauty treatment hitting the United States: the promise of better looking eyelashes through a prescription drug called Latisse. ""It's the latest, the greatest,"" exclaimed the party hostess, Christine Glavine, wife of Major League Baseball pitcher Tom Glavine. She invited a group of friends to meet with local plastic surgeon Dr. Randy Rudderman to get a dose of the new FDA-approved medication. Glavine didn't have to do much convincing. Tammie Wilson, 43, of Roswell, Georgia, said she was motivated to try the product because ""I want to be able to look like I have on makeup when I don't.""  Watch more on the marketing of Latisse Â» . ""I have blond hair and blond lashes. I have to put on three coats of mascara,"" complained her friend Jennifer Altmeyer, also 43 and from Roswell. Altmeyer, who is hoping to be able to skip mascara altogether, was the first to line up at Rudderman's exam room. The drug is available only through a doctor; it is approved to treat hair loss on the lash line. The product maker, Allergan, says Latisse will thicken, darken and lengthen inadequate or skimpy eyelashes in as little as eight weeks. But, here's the catch: Doctors report it takes up to 16 weeks to see maximum eyelash growth. If you discontinue Latisse, your lashes will go back to their original state in a few months. Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living . Oh, and by the way, the drug isn't cheap. It costs about $120 for a 30-day supply. Latisse was discovered almost by accident, Rudderman said. The product contains a compound that is also found in medication that decreases eye pressure in glaucoma patients. ""A significant number of those patients started having a side effect of increased growth of eyelashes,"" said Rudderman. Women like Altmeyer are clamoring to give Latisse a try. Rudderman's assistant first removed Altmeyer's eye makeup and then applied a drop of Latisse to a small applicator. The wand was then swiped across her top lashes. Rudderman advised Altmeyer to apply the drug once a day before she goes to bed and not to apply Latisse to lower lashes because they come in contact with the medicine on the top lashes during blinks. Rudderman said Latisse comes with several warnings: It is approved only for those over 18 and is not recommended for pregnant women, people with pre-existing eye conditions or those with allergies to the ingredients. Rudderman said some of the most common side effects are itchy and red eyes and hyper-pigmentation, or darkening along the eyelash base. Dr. Pradeep Sinha, a plastic surgeon in Atlanta, Georgia, started working with the glaucoma version of the medication two years ago on an off-label -- or trial -- basis, before it was approved specifically for eyelash thickening. While he said his patients were happy with the results, Sinha noted another unpleasant side effect if the user is not careful while wielding the applicator. ""One patient was messy and grew small, fuzzy hair on her eyelid,"" Sinha said. He instructed the woman to stop using the product, and the unwanted hair eventually fell out. Some women, like Mary Johnson, a 56-year-old breast cancer survivor, are willing to take their chances. After undergoing chemotherapy last year she lost a lot of eyelashes. ""That was really devastating for me,"" she said. She said she could put a wig on her head, but for the rest of her face she had to ""fake it"" by drawing in a lash line and eyebrows with cosmetics. Johnson tried some over-the-counter lash products, but she said none of them worked. She was smiling as she received her first dose of Latisse from Rudderman. ""Until you have lost your eyelashes, you don't really realize how hard it is to put eye makeup on,"" she said. ""When you lose your eyelashes you just don't look the same.""","Newly FDA-approved Latisse promises to thicken, darken and lengthen lashes .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Sada Jacobson may be a world champion fencer with three Olympic medals, but dressed in a T-shirt and sweats, she looked like any other student getting a lesson at the gym. Olympic medalist Sada Jacobson says ""a little hard work, a little luck and some guidance"" makes a champion. She grabbed her saber, pulled down her mask and started sparing with her long-time coach, Arkady Burdan, at the Nellya Fencers facility in Atlanta, Georgia. ""I've been doing this for 10 years,"" remarked Jacobson, 25, a first-year law student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""I never anticipated that this is where my life would take me, and it has been an amazing trip."" This year alone, that trip has taken her to competitions around the world from Algiers, Algeria, to Havana, Cuba, and eventually to Beijing, China, where she claimed two Olympic medals.  Watch Sada Jacobson on the move Â» . About a dozen young fencers gathered around her during a break from their own lessons to take a close look at Jacobson's silver and bronze medallions. She passed around another bronze medal that she earned at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. Jacobson isn't one to brag, but she's happy to serve as a role model for the next generation of competitive fencers. She said all it takes to be a champion is ""a little hard work, a little luck and some guidance."" Jacobson was inspired to pursue fencing by her own father. David Jacobson was a member of the 1974 U.S. National Fencing team. Her mother and two younger sisters also participate in the sport. She blushed when her father stepped into the group of children admiring her medals and reminded them that Sada ""started out just like you guys."" Sada Jacobson played down her abilities. ""The beauty of this sport is that anyone can do it,"" she said. ""It's such a mental game that you can use any kind of physical attribute to your advantage."" There are three types of fencing: epee, foil and sabre. Jacobson specializes in sabre. ""Sabre is analogous to a sprint,"" she explained. ""It's very fast, very powerful. It's over very quickly, and you have to put a ton of energy into changing your momentum."" While preparing for the Olympics, Jacobson spent countless hours cross training and working on agility exercises. Unlike other sports, Jacobson called fencing an asymmetrical workout. ""You are constantly in an unnatural body position,"" she said. ""It's very lower-body specific, so you need really strong legs, but you also need to be very quick and light on your feet,"" she noted. The physical preparation was only part of her focus. She also studied countless videotapes of her opponents in competition in an effort to mentally outsmart them. Burdan, her coach, described the sport as a form of ""physical chess."" He said that Jacobson has outstanding technical skills but that she's also one of the best fencers in the world because she uses her brain to strategize during a match. That's helped her during the past five years as she captured medals in more than two dozen World Championship, World Cup and Grand Prix competitions. She arrived at the Beijing Olympics ranked No. 1 in the world. When she returned to Atlanta after the Olympics, the entire team from the Nellya club was there to greet her at the airport. Seeing that kind of hometown support ""was a truly amazing feeling,"" she said. One of her admirers is Matthew Tennant, 12, a budding fencer. He knows that it is going to take a lot of hard work and practice to match Jacobson's accomplishments. ""It's kind of cool that she's been in the Olympics,"" he said. ""You know, it's not every day you get to meet a famous person."" Jacobson may be famous but not enough to forget where she got her start or to know when it's time to hang up her saber. ""I'm retiring,"" she announced. ""My coach thinks I'm going to make a comeback, but I'm committed to doing some other stuff."" The other ""stuff"" includes plans to get married next year and finishing law school. ""I enjoy coming back and seeing everyone and fencing for fun,"" she said. ""But I think this is it for me.""","Sada Jacobson, world champion fencer, is happy to serve as a role model for kids .

"KENNESAW, Georgia (CNN) -- Singing ""Frosty the Snowman"" and ""Jingle Bells"" may not seem like a big deal to most third-graders, but for Joey Finley, 8, doctors say it's a miracle. Joey Finley, 8, suffers from a rare condition that can prevent people from speaking normally. The blond, freckle-faced boy was unable to speak in a normal voice until about a year ago. ""I thought I would sound bad,"" he said. Joey suffers from a rare virus that can get into the cells of the voice box. ""He has a condition called recurrent papillomatosis,"" explained Dr. Steven Sobol, director of pediatric otolaryngology at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. ""It causes growths like warts that you would see in other parts of the body.""  Watch and hear Joey sing Â» . Sobol said lesions in RRP (for the condition's full name, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis) are caused by the human papilloma virus, or HPV, the same condition that causes cervical cancer. An estimated 20,000 children and adults in the United States suffer from the disease. Not only can RRP rob patients of their ability to speak normally, it can create serious breathing problems if left untreated. ""It can be rapidly fatal for somebody who completely blocks off their airway,"" Sobol said. ""Try to imagine breathing through a coffee stirrer. That's what those children breathe like when they first come to our attention,"" Sobol described. Experts aren't sure exactly why some people contract the virus, but Sobol believes that ""it's a combination of genetic factors and exposure either in utero or during early childhood."" Joey's symptoms surfaced during infancy. His mother, Melanie Finley, recalled that when Joey was a year old, he would strain his neck muscles every time he tried to talk. She took the child to several doctors before they finally met with Sobol, who diagnosed the condition. Finley was relieved to get some answers, but Joey's medical journey was just beginning. Sobol reported that from the age of 4, Joey endured 16 surgeries to remove the growths from his vocal cords. ""When I first met Joey ... he couldn't breathe,"" Sobol recalled. Treating the boy took time, the doctor explained. ""Even though you remove the parts of the virus that you can visually see ... the virus will tend to regenerate the growths, so over time ... days or months, it will cause the growths to reoccur and obstruct the airways."" RRP is not passed through casual contact, and there is no cure. Sobol is hopeful that one day, a vaccine may be used to help prevent the development of the disease. He said Gardasil, a series of three shots offered to adolescent girls for the prevention of cervical cancer, may be one of the drugs used to stop the spread of RRP. Ear, nose and throat specialists end up spending a lot of time with their patients with this condition, Sobol said. ""I tell my parents once we diagnose a child, 'We're going to get to know each other really, really well. Coming to see me is like going to the dentist.' "" But there's an obvious difference between removing laryngeal warts and cleaning teeth. ""Certain children have a very tough time with this,"" Sobol acknowledged. ""They're in the operating room every two weeks to save their life. ... Then, there are children like Joey who have the disease when they're very young and grow out of it by the time they are older adolescents or teenagers."" Though he's required fewer operations during the last couple of years, the surgeries altered Joey's voice. He used to joke with his doctors that he had ""frogs"" in his throat. Between all the procedures that caused him to miss school and his shyness about his voice, Joey was reluctant to socialize. His mother said he was teased by his preschool classmates. ""There is nothing worse than being different,"" she stated. Joey's outlook started changing shortly after he was assigned to work with Edie Hapner, a speech language pathologist at Emory University School of Medicine. ""When Joey came in, he was using compensatory muscles to make his voice,"" Hapner said. ""He had had so many surgeries on his vocal cords, he didn't even know how to use them anymore."" It took a little over a year, but Hapner is credited in part with giving Joey his voice back. She taught him how to imitate funny sounds. ""Things like lip trills and tongue trills,"" Hapner said. ""Silly little motorboat and car noises that physiologically and comfortably help people get their voice."" Hapner said it didn't take long in their few first sessions together before Joey was able to make normal sounds. ""I heard a sweet little high-pitched voice, not that 80-year-old man voice in a 5-year-old body,"" she said. Melanie Finley remembered: ""I bawled when I heard his real voice."" Hapner called Joey's recovery a miracle. ""To see someone like Joey, who every day is getting in trouble for talking or singing and is now participating in after-school activities that he would not do before because of his voice, it's incredible."" And what's it like to sing Christmas songs with classmates? ""I usually was afraid to sing, and now I'm not,"" Joey said. ""You actually get to have fun and use your voice.""","8-year-old left unable to speak normally by a rare virus in his voice box .

"(CNN) -- Amanda Wagner and Jessica Tuttle turn 50 this year, but they're not letting age hold them back from their favorite exercise: running. They've been lacing up their running shoes since their teens and show few signs of slowing down. Research on older runners suggests they may not have to. Jessica Tuttle, 50, left, and Amanda Wagner, 49, have been running for more than 30 years. ""It's a little bit harder, but that's part of the challenge I think,"" says Wagner. When she isn't traveling for her job at a pharmaceutical company, Wagner tries to get together with Tuttle for 45-minute pre-work runs three to five days a week. Tuttle, who is a medical epidemiologist at the Georgia Health Department, feels that running gets her day off to a good start. ""It really wakes me up in the morning,"" says Tuttle. ""It gives me an edge when I go in to work."" Conventional wisdom holds that the pounding from years of running leads to excessive wear and tear on the body as we age,  resulting in joint injuries, knee replacements or arthritis. So-called weekend warriors -- people who aren't in the type of shape needed to safely run sprints, dive for passes or make cuts on the basketball court -- add to this misconception when they hobble into their doctors' office after an injury. But a study out of Stanford University that looked at healthy aging runners found that running did not damage joints or leave runners less able to exercise. Researchers discovered that if you're healthy and generally free of injury, there are few reasons to put away your running shoes, even into your 70s and 80s.  Watch more on running as you age Â» . ""Moderate [running], three to five miles at a time, three times a week will actually help your joints to be more resilient and function a little bit better,"" says Dr. Amadeus Mason at Emory Sports Medicine Center in Atlanta, Georgia. But he stresses that keeping the joints healthy in the first place may be the key to running longevity. That includes not running through pain, and resting if you have an injury, something Tuttle takes seriously. ""I try to rest maybe if I'm having some specific pain that seems to be over a couple of days,"" she says. Mason also warns against running if you suffer from a chronic knee injury. In this case, the continuous pounding could accelerate damage and lead to arthritis. Instead, choose joint-friendly exercises such as swimming, walking or a workout machine such as the elliptical. Even if you have remained healthy, as Wagner and Tuttle have, don't get overzealous and overdo it. ""The biggest risk that runners will face as they age, with regard to injury, is overtraining, by far,"" says Mason, who recommends giving yourself a day of rest between runs, or cross-training on the non-running days. In addition, Mason advises wearing the proper footwear and making sure to stretch before and after a run. Beyond the good news about aging joints, the Stanford researchers also discovered some surprising overall health benefits for senior runners when they compared them with non-runners of the same age: Those in the running group were less likely to die from heart trouble, stroke, cancer, neurological diseases or infection.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain the study findings Â» . ""The survival rate of the runners was again twice that of the controls,"" study author Dr. Eliza Chakravarty says. She says the findings were a surprise to the researchers. Additionally, runners enjoyed a better day-to-day quality of life in old age than their more sedentary peers. ""Members of the running group, it took them 16 years longer to reach certain levels of disability,"" says Chakravarty. ""Running is not the only thing that's going to make you live longer and be healthier; it's actually probably engaging in any kind of exercise that people enjoy,"" notes Chakravarty. ""It's never too late to start incorporating regular exercise into your routine ... health benefits can last for decades."" But running is still the exercise of choice for Wagner and Tuttle, who have remained relatively injury-free throughout their 30-year running careers. The women don't plan to hang up their running shoes any time soon. ""I really can't imagine not running; it's that much a part of my life,"" says Wagner. ""And I do expect and hope to be running when I'm 60 and when I'm 70 -- I truly do.""","Stanford University study finds that running did not damage joints in aging runners .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- An enormous Asian elephant stepped out from behind a big red curtain at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Atlanta, Georgia. Eli Hummer, 3, gets to try out an oversized motorbike at the circus. An audience of 20 pre-schoolers clapped and squealed as the elephant was handed a tiny harmonica and started playing. But, instead of sitting far away in the stands, the children, all visually impaired, were just a few feet away from the action. Among them was 3-year-old Eli Hummer. ""He doesn't see, so to learn about it, he has to touch it and be close to it,"" explained his mother, Martha Hummer. She said being able to use the sense of smell, touch and sound helps her son understand the concept of a circus. Every year as it tours the country, Ringling Brothers sponsors a ""Blind-Touch Tour"" in about a dozen cities. During a stop in Atlanta, Georgia, children from the Center for the Visually Impaired got more than a front row seat. After the show, they were invited into the circus ring to interact with performers and try out some of their props.  Watch more on the ""Blind-Touch"" tour Â» . Eight stations were set up where children could touch and try on circus costumes, play with giant umbrellas and butterfly wings and sit on an oversized motorcycle. Clowns roamed the ring juggling and trying to make the children laugh. One clown dressed in a polka dot shirt and checkered pants took Eli's little hand and asked the boy if he wanted to touch the red clown nose.  Watch some of the sights and sounds of the circus Â» . Eli responded by trying to pull off the ball-like prop. His teacher, Joyce Burnett, who is also visually impaired, spent two weeks before the circus visit preparing the kids in the classroom for the unique experience. ""We had clown shoes, a nose and a wig and we tried all of those on,"" Burnett said. She said the students also listened to elephant sounds and drew the outline of the animals with chalk. ""Eighty to 90 percent of early learning comes through vision,"" Burnett said. ""Our children are not using vision or (have) very little vision, so all of the other senses will make their world real."" Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living . Michelle Singleton, mother of 4-year-old Miya, said the experience is something the kids can't get anywhere else. ""The fact that she's on the floor now, she is really excited. She wanted to see the elephants so she's happy now,"" Singleton said. Four-year-old Kristina Masta was fascinated with a trapeze swing that was hanging low to the ground. One of the performers helped the girl climb on while her mother, Michelle Masta, stood nearby. ""Because of her visual impairment anything that is highly tactile and brightly colored helps out a lot,"" Masta said. Her daughter weighed 1 pound, 1 ounce at birth and suffers from retinopathy of prematurity, a disease in which the small blood vessels in the back of the eye grow abnormally. Masta said other people may not realize the limitations and challenges of having a visually impaired child. ""Everything is ten times harder,"" she said. Masta smiled as her daughter handed her a rainbow-colored lollypop to unwrap. ""The kids feel special because they get to actually do something that the other kids don't do, and it is a real treat,"" Masta said.","Ringling Brothers' ""Blind-Touch Tour"" gives visually impaired kids circus experience .

"SMYRNA, Georgia (CNN) -- A week before the start of the new school year, principal Denise Magee roamed the hallways of Campbell Middle School in Smyrna, Georgia, preparing for battle. Middle-school principal Denise Magee says a best-case scenario would be a school year without bullying. The adversary? Preteen and teenage bullies. Toting anti-bullying posters and masking tape, Magee was determined to let students see from Day One that she had a zero-tolerance policy when it came to that kind of harassment. ""Middle-school kids are just cruel to each other,"" Magee said. ""They speak their minds, so you see bullying in the form of teasing, taunting, social isolation and name calling."" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimated that 30 percent of all children in grades six through 10 have been bullied or have bullied other children during a school year. Clinical psychologist Mark Crawford of Roswell, Georgia, called the statistics unacceptable. ""Bullying is not a rite of passage,"" he said. ""It always has a bad outcome."" Crawford said several times a month he hears complaints from young patients who are victims of bullies. And he worried about the consequences. ""Kids who are bullied are at greater risk of physical symptoms, physical complaints, emotional problems and academic underachievement."" Parenting expert Stacey DeBroff, author of ""The Mom Book,"" cautioned that bullying often occurs in places that aren't monitored by adults, such as a walking route to and from school, a corner of a playground and the Internet. She warned mothers and fathers to be on the lookout for signs a child is being bullied. ""When you see signs of being anxious, sad and withdrawn, of having a kid move off their typical personality, it alerts you that something is going on."" Crawford noted that some of those symptoms can be attributed to typical adolescent behavior, but he added, ""When you see a real change in a child's personality or their normal routine, it's a bad sign.""  Health Minute: Watch more on defeating bullies Â» . He also conceded that some children won't open up to their parents about bullying. ""One of the reasons kids don't tell their parents they are being bullied is the fear that their parents will run in and do something about it and they think that will make it worse."" DeBroff agreed that it is tempting for some parents to rush in to solve the problem by calling the bully's parents. ""You often know them, your kids have been in school together, you feel like calling them up...so they're on the defensive and really it's never a point of resolution."" Crawford said that it's important to do your homework before attempting to resolve the situation. He encouraged parents to talk with their child first and get them to open up about what's happening. ""You need to find out when it is happening, where it is happening and exactly what is going on,"" he said. When elementary age children are involved, Crawford recommended parents intervene more quickly. ""Younger kids have a limited arsenal from which to draw,"" he said. ""They don't necessarily know how to be more assertive."" Middle-school students may want to have some control over the situation, according to Crawford. In that case, he said it might be a good idea to go over possible scenarios and options that will help them put a stop to the bullying. DeBroff said it is important to ask for help from a teacher or school administrator. ""They want to know about it because it ripples into the classrooms and places that aren't visible to them."" Magee, the middle-school principal, agreed. ""I do not want parents to leave us out of the scenario,"" she said. ""I want them to immediately contact us."" But be judicious, she urged. Some parents can inflame the situation. ""You will encounter situations where parents will tell their kids, 'If you are hit, I want you to hit back.' "" Experts point out it is important for parents to keep emotions in check and to not encourage a child to hit back or retaliate. Instead, DeBroff suggested parents become strategic advisers to their child and help them avoid bullying situations. In a couple of weeks, after her students get settled, Magee plans to hold grade-level meetings about her school's anti-bullying policy. In the meantime, she remained optimistic and hoped this school year will be different. ""The best-case scenario as local school principal? We are bullyproof, fully free of any bully incidents, that we are truly here with academic focus, no fighting, no teasing, no name calling, none of that. We're here to learn.""","HHS estimate: 30 percent of all kids grades 6-10 are bullied or have bullied annually .

"(CNN) -- A conservative billionaire businessman and a former center-left president will face off in a runoff election in Chile's presidential race, based on official early results released Sunday. With more than 98 percent of polling stations counted, billionaire businessman Sebastian Pinera led ex-president Eduardo Frei with 44 percent of the vote to Frei's 30 percent, Chile's interior ministry reported. ""This is a victory for all the Chileans who want change,"" Pinera said Sunday night. Frei began campaigning for the second-round immediately, asking in a speech for the supporters of the two other candidates who had their presidential ambitions dashed to join his cause. Frei said if he is elected, women and young people will have an important role in his government. He explicitly asked for those who voted for Marco Enriquez-Ominami and Jorge Arrate, who were eliminated in Sunday's ballot, to vote for him in the runoff. In a concession speech, Enriquez-Ominami said that he would not endorse either candidate. The winner will follow the footsteps of a very popular president, Michelle Bachelet, who will be leaving office with high approval ratings for steering the country through the global economic downturn, and promoting progressive social reforms. Under Chile's constitutional term limits, a president cannot run for a second consecutive term. Bachelet endorsed Frei, a member of her same left-leaning coalition, but another leftist candidate who ran as an independent -- Enriquez-Ominami -- made an impressive run, pulling in 20 percent of the vote and splitting votes for the ruling party. Those who voted for him, ""have affirmed the desire for Chile to move forward and toward the future,"" he said. If Pinera triumphs in the expected January runoff election, it would mark the first time since the fall of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship that a conservative wins at the polls. In the 19 years since Pinochet's fall, all the presidents have come from the left-leaning coalition. Pinera, 60, is one of the country's wealthiest businessmen who previously served as a senator and president of the National Renovation party. Since completing one term as president, Frei returned to politics as a Christian Democrat senator who has campaigned on continuing Bachelet's policies. While Frei and Pinera were household names before the election, it was the 36-year-old Enriquez-Ominami who made a political name for himself in this presidential election. He worked as a television director before being elected as a congressman for the Socialist party in 2005. The son of a guerrilla leader from the 1970s, Enriquez-Ominami forged his own political path, breaking from the leftist coalition and running on his own. A fourth candidate, Arrate of the Communist Party, garnered 6 percent of Sunday's vote, according to the early vote figures.","NEW: Sebastian Pinera, Eduardo Frei will face off in a runoff in Chile's presidential election .

"It was hard to miss the bright yellow Student Driver bumper sticker on the back of the car driven by Tosha Mulligan. Tosha Mullgian, 19, has attention deficit disorder. She says her mind wanders when she drives. Getting a driver's license is a rite of passage for many teenagers, but the process was a bit more challenging for 19-year-old Mulligan of Acworth, Georgia. She has attention deficit disorder. When she gets behind the wheel, she said, ""Sometimes my mind wanders off."" She's not alone. Researchers reported driving can be a serious problem for teens with ADD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Motor vehicle accidents already are the leading cause of death among teenagers in the U.S., according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Experts such as Russell Barkley say ADD and ADHD compound the problem. Barkley, a psychiatry professor at the Medical University of South Carolina, is a widely recognized expert on ADD and driving. He has investigated the topic for 15 years and conducted a half-dozen studies, some of which have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Teen drivers with ADD or ADHD ""are impulsive, highly distractible and clumsy, can't pay attention to the roadway and they get bored easily,"" he said.  Health Minute: More on teens driving with ADD/ADHD Â» . Mulligan's driving instructor, Jerry Thielemann of Freedom and Mobility Driver Training and Evaluation in Marietta, Georgia, experienced that firsthand. He works with teenagers with ADD three to four times a week. ""A person with ADD pays attention to someone walking down the street rather than a car coming toward them,"" Mulligan said. ""They don't know what to focus on."" Barkley sees speeding as a key problem. ""In general, people with ADHD speed four times more often than those without ADHD,"" he said. His research shows that those with ADD or ADHD are two to three times more likely to have an auto accident, three times more likely in the first five to eight years of driving to have their licenses revoked and five times more likely to get a parking ticket. In all three instances, Barkley pointed to the impatient and impulsive nature that is common among people with ADD or ADHD. Chris Zeigler Dendy, author of ""Teenagers with ADD and ADHD,"" raised a son and a stepson with the condition. ""We were worried sick about our kids when they started driving because both had ADHD,"" Dendy recalled. ""They both started getting speeding tickets and having car wrecks. One of them even had his license suspended."" That was nearly 20 years ago. Today, Dendy said, she understands what was behind their troubles. ""I think the good news is that parents today are so much better informed than we were, plus laws have tightened up so you get one ticket or step out of line and your license is gone,"" she said. Dendy credited proper medication with helping get her sons back on track. ""Research tells us that with medication they are more likely to pay attention to road signs and less likely to have road rage,"" Dendy explained. She worried about parents who may not be as vigilant when it comes to monitoring their teen's driving behavior, especially during high-risk times. ""One is after school from 3 to 6 and the other is on weekend evenings,"" she said. She mentioned those are often the hours when medication starts to wear off or when teens may be more likely to skip a dosage. Barkley acknowledged the parents who decline to medicate their children who have ADD or ADHD, but he believes ""Medication is more effective than any other treatment."" Barkley also cautioned that people with ADD are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol and are unable to drive safely after drinking. He told teens to put away their cell phones, MP3 players and other items that might distract them while driving. Barkley suggested parents closely monitor their teenagers and provide sign-in and sign-out sheets in the garage to track their whereabouts. Dendy eventually drew up a contract with her children, spelling out specific rules and expectations for driving the family car. Dendy and Barkley both recommended that teenagers with ADD or ADHD stay in a learner's permit program longer, at least a year, and put off getting their license until they have more experience behind the wheel. That's what Tosha Mulligan did. She finished her last driving lesson the day before she left for her freshman year in college. She passed her driver's test on the first try and got her license. She said waiting to get her license made a big difference. She said ""It kept me focused."" She reported no wrecks, no tickets and no problems so far.","ADD and ADHD compound the problem of teen car accident deaths, experts say .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- You wouldn't know it by looking at her, but at any given moment Dana Poole hurts all over. Dana Poole, left, feels aches all over at any given moment from a condition called fibromyalgia. ""It's kind of like a burning, but an ache. It's almost like you have the flu,"" said Poole, 31, a receptionist from Canton, Georgia. Poole is one of almost 6 million Americans who suffer from a chronic condition called fibromyalgia. In addition to widespread pain, patients may complain about fatigue and sleep disturbances, depression, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome and heightened sensitivity. ""Dana is typical of a lot of fibromyalgia patients,"" said Dr. Jefrey Lieberman, an Atlanta, Georgia-based rheumatologist. ""She came into my office complaining of a lot of diffuse pain all over her body and fatigue. She really didn't know why she was getting it."" That's part of the frustration of having fibromyalgia. Experts aren't sure what causes it, but many believe many factors are involved. Some think the condition, which is not progressive or life-threatening, may be triggered by an emotional or traumatic event. Lieberman believed it is related to a disordered sleep pattern and poor exercise. ""It appears to be more of a neuro-chemical process,"" he said. ""In other words, there really is no inflammation in patients with fibromyalgia.""  Health Minute: More on identifying fibromyalgia Â» . Getting a proper diagnosis can sometimes be just as frustrating as finding out what's behind the disease. ""Fibromyalgia is to some extent a diagnosis of exclusion,"" Lieberman said. ""There are lot of things it can be confused with such as thyroid disorders, metabolic disorders and certain rheumatologic inflammatory conditions."" For almost five years, Poole jumped from doctor to doctor trying to figure out what was causing her symptoms. ""They were constantly saying I'm a tall, thin female. 'You're getting older -- your body is going to change,' and it was frustrating."" Lieberman understood Poole's frustration. ""Sometimes fibromyalgia is used as a wastebasket term if a patient has pain and they don't know what it is from,"" he said. ""It is frequently misdiagnosed. In fact, it is overdiagnosed and it is underdiagnosed."" Specialists such as Lieberman can make a proper diagnosis based on criteria set by the American College of Rheumatology. ""Those criteria are diffuse pain in three or more quadrants of the body and the presence of what are called tender points in the body,"" Lieberman explained. ""There are 18 total tender points, and by definition we like to see 11 of those tender points being present."" It's estimated that up to 90 percent of patients are women. Most of them start feeling symptoms in early and middle adulthood. Poole remembered that the pain first started when she was 20. It wasn't until she met Lieberman about five years ago that she got some relief. She took part in a drug study for Cymbalta, one of two medications approved for the management of fibromyalgia. The other drug is called Lyrica. ""Both of them are geared toward the patient's well-being as well as improving their pain,"" Lieberman said. He also encouraged Poole to control her condition through a healthy diet, stress reduction, getting enough sleep and regular low-impact exercise. ""We think that aerobic exercise helps to stimulate endorphins and enkephlins from the body which are your own natural pain relievers,"" Lieberman said. The doctor is quick to point out that even with proper medication and adequate exercise, fibromyalgia has no cure. Although Lieberman said some of his patients report the symptoms tapering off in their mid-50s and -60s, others are faced with years of managing the condition. ""For most of my patients, I tell them that I can get you 50 to 75 percent better and many of those patients will jump at that,"" he said. Poole is one of them, but knowing that she'll need to follow a careful daily regimen can be daunting, she said. ""It wears you out, mentally, physically and emotionally.""","Nearly 6 million Americans suffer from a chronic illness called fibromyalgia .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has revealed that he believes seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher will come out of retirement and join the new Mercedes team. The German has been a consultant with Ferrari, for whom he won five of his drivers' crowns, since he ended his career in 2006. He almost got back behind the wheel for the Italian marque this year as a replacement for the injured Felipe Massa, but his comeback was cut short due to the lingering effects of a neck injury suffered in a motorbike accident. However, the 40-year-old is now reportedly ready to return alongside compatriot Nico Rosberg for 2010 with German manufacturer Mercedes, who took a controlling interest in 2009's double world champions Brawn. Di Montezemolo told reporters at Ferrari's Christmas lunch in Fiorano that Schumacher was close to sealing a deal, the UK Press Association reported. ""I hadn't spoken to him since Abu Dhabi but I spoke to him on Wednesday,"" Di Montezemolo said. ""He phoned me and he told me that there is a very, very, very strong possibility [of joining Mercedes]. ""Having said that, it is not 100 percent decided. But that is what he said."" Schumacher is poised to end a 13-year association with Ferrari if he joins Mercedes. ""The real Schumacher, the one I know, will remain forever part of the Ferrari family,"" Di Montezemolo told Ferrari's official Web site. ""I said it in Monza and I repeated it in Abu Dhabi, but, it seems he has a twin brother, identical in every way, who seems to have it in his head to go and race in Formula One with Mercedes. ""I don't know him personally, but it seems we have nothing to offer him -- we have two young drivers in Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso, on whom we are counting to deliver a lot next year. ""I think that, this summer, when I asked him to stand in for Felipe, after the terrible accident in Budapest, he suddenly rediscovered the desire to race and the fact he was unable to follow through with that, left him a void that we are unable to fill. ""I remember how despondent he sounded on the evening of August 9, when he called me to say that the problem with his neck meant he could not race in Valencia. ""We have tried to move forward with the idea of running a third car, but for the moment, that is not possible. I don't know what he will decide for the future, but I extend to him, and indeed his twin brother, my very best wishes.""","Ferrari believe F1 legend Michael Schumacher will come out of retirement .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Investigators are reviewing the flight data recorder from American Airlines Flight 331, the plane that overran a runway this week near Kingston, Jamaica, and crashed into a fence. A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman said Thursday that the recorder arrived in the agency's Washington laboratory overnight. Crews continue to look for the cockpit voice recorder. The flight originated from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, and landed in Miami, Florida, before heading to Jamaica, the airline said. It had been raining Tuesday when the plane failed to stop and ran into a fence past the end of the runway, Radio Jamaica reporter Kirk Abraham said. Ninety-one people were taken to three area hospitals, where most were evaluated and released, an American Airlines spokesman said. Ten were admitted, he said, and five remain hospitalized Thursday afternoon. The flight was carrying 148 passengers and six crew members when it landed in Kingston, the airline said.

"(CNN)  -- New Zealand maxi Alfa Romeo took advantage of a break in light weather conditions to steal a march on its rivals in the annual Sydney-Hobart yacht race off the south-east coast of Australia on Sunday. Skipper Neville Crichton's 100-foot vessel has led since leaving Sydney Heads, and moved more than 10 nautical miles ahead at the halfway stage in the evening. Second-placed British entry ICAP Leopard and Australia's four-time line honors winner Wild Oats failed to catch an early breeze, giving Crichton the edge with more patchy weather predicted ahead in the 628 nautical mile event. Leopard skipper Mike Slade told the race's official Web site that Alfa Romeo made a break at around 9 a.m. near Gabo Island after hours of frustratingly light winds. ""We were all just splashing about, there was no breeze whatsoever, and it's always the case that someone will get that little extra puff,"" Slade said. ""Alfa Romeo was in the right place to get it. We didn't get it, Wild Oats XI didn't get it, and Alfa put 10 miles on us both very quickly."" Wild Oats set the race record of one day, 18 hours and 40 minutes in 2005, but that mark is almost certain to still be standing at the end of the 65th staging of the event, with the winner expected to cross the line on arrival at the island state of Tasmania on Monday night. ""We were unfortunate to get into a hole. We could see Alfa when she got her nose into the new breeze,"" skipper Mark Richards told rolexsydneyhobart.com. ""These things happen. There is always an element of luck, and things went his way. It's one of those frustrating things -- a role reversal of 2005."" However, with conditions uncertain there is still a chance that 2002 winner Crichton could yet be denied a first victory in a yacht that was launched in 2005 and has 143 line honors triumphs to date. ""The big guys will have some running in Bass Strait, but there are still a lot of potholes between that and the finish,"" yachting forecaster Roger Badham told the Web site. ""Anyone of the three could finish first."" Noel Cornish's Sydney 47 St Jude is a surprise leader in the handicap standings, while the Sydney 38 Mondo became the fifth entry to retire and leave the fleet reduced to 95. The race, first held in 1945, has been hit by severe weather conditions in recent years. In 1998, six competitors died and several boats were lost during a fierce storm on the first night. Two years ago the fleet was also hit by similar conditions, and eight yachtsman had to abandon a sinking craft.","New Zealand maxi Alfa Romeo extends lead in Sydney-Hobart yacht race on Sunday .

"London, England (CNN) -- Simon Cowell's stranglehold on the British Christmas record charts looks as though it might be coming to an end. The talent show judge's latest protege and winner of British TV talent show ""The X Factor,"" Joe McElderry is currently lagging behind heavy-rock group Rage Against The Machine in the battle for the UK Christmas number-one slot. With just over two days to go before the winner is announced, Rage Against The Machine's re-release of their 1992 song ""Killing in the Name"" is narrowly beating ""The Climb,"" McElderry's cover of a Miley Cyrus hit. The winner of ""The X Factor"" -- which Cowell produces and judges -- has held the top spot over the festive season in the UK for the past four years. The popularity of the talent show -- this year's final was watched by around 20 million viewers -- has meant the race to the number-one slot in recent years has been, in effect, a non-contest because of the publicity the ""X Factor"" winner has enjoyed. But a campaign on the social networking site ""Facebook"" to make the U.S. rock group number-one ahead of ""The X Factor"" winner has received massive support from the British record buying public who have been snapping up ""Killing in the Name"" in their thousands. Whoever ends up on top of the UK charts this Christmas, the Rage/Cowell battle has enlivened what has become a rather dull and predictable procession to the top of the charts by the winner of the UK talent show. In an appearance on BBC radio station ""5 live"" Thursday, Rage's front man Zach De La Rocha swore several times during a live performance, forcing the BBC to issue an apology to listeners. And on Friday, Sir Paul McCartney, came out in support of the U.S. rock group, despite performing on the final show of ""The X Factor"" this year. Speaking to Sky News McCartney said: ""It would be kind of funny if Rage Against The Machine got it."" Meanwhile, Simon Cowell has been raging against, well, just about anyone in defense of McElderry telling the UK tabloid newspaper ""The Sun"" that ""musical snobs have ganged up against Joe."" He also called the Facebook campaign ""a huge hate mob"" -- a claim which the Facebook group have denied. All will be revealed this Sunday when the final UK singles chart before Christmas is announced. Will the talent judge be celebrating his fifth ""Christmas Cowell"" in a row or will he be overcome by Rage? We'll have to wait and see.","Rage Against The Machine heading for UK Christmas number-one .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Former French President Jacques Chirac has been placed under investigation for allegations stemming from his time as mayor of Paris, his office said Friday. A judge in Nanterre, near Paris, questioned Chirac Friday morning over the employment of seven people who were hired by the city of Paris in the early 1990s. The suspicion is that the employees were working for Chirac's right-wing political party, RPR, which no longer exists, while on the city payroll. Chirac, 77, was mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995, the year he became president. The case in Nanterre is similar to but separate from another investigation in Paris, in which Chirac is accused of using 21 city employees to work on his presidential campaign. In a statement released by his office Friday, Chirac pointed out that he had ""already answered all the questions related to this investigation regarding the seven jobs in July 2007 and that no new facts have surfaced since then."" Chirac could face a five-year sentence and a fine of 75,000 euros ($107,500) if found guilty of using the employees to work for his party. The former president denies the accusations. ""On the investigation itself, President Chirac repeats that no such 'system' has ever existed in the Paris city hall,"" the statement said. ""He is determined to demonstrate this through the procedure which was started by being placed under investigation."" The former French head of state also said he ""wishes the investigation to progress as quickly as possible to establish once and for all that he is beyond reproach."" Former French Prime Minister Alain Juppe was already sentenced in December 2004 for his role in the affair, but Chirac benefited from presidential immunity at the time. After Chirac left office in May 2007, he made it known he was available to answer any questions on the matter. Current Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe had no comment about the investigation, according to officials with the city of Paris, which lodged the initial complaint against Chirac. The former president remains popular in France. A survey released Thursday, conducted by the opinion research company IFOP for Paris Match magazine, showed that 78 percent of French people have a positive opinion of Chirac -- making him the highest-rated politician since the survey began in November 2003. CNN's Luc Lacroix contributed to this report.","Authorities are investigating Jacques Chirac over alleged corruption charges .

"(CNN) -- Rangers restored their four-point lead over Celtic despite conceding the fastest goal in Scottish Premier League history on Sunday. The Glasgow side went behind after only 12.4 seconds as Hibernian striker Anthony Stokes surpassed the previous mark set by Saulius Mikoliunas for Edinburgh rivals Hearts back in 2006, but bounced back to register a 4-1 away victory. Scotland striker Kenny Miller scored in each half, while goals from fellow frontmen Kris Boyd and Nacho Novo ensured that third-placed Hibs' unbeaten run of 13 league games came to an end. Celtic had closed the gap to one point after beating Hamilton Academicals 2-0 on Saturday. Rangers, meanwhile, expect to have Madjid Bougherra available for Wednesday's home clash with fourth-placed Dundee United, but the Algeria defender will leave for African Nations Cup duty in Angola before next Sunday's Old Firm derby showdown with Celtic. ""That's the way it's looking at the present moment,"" manager Walter Smith said. Smith will also be without United States winger DaMarcus Beasley for the next few weeks after he suffered an injury in training before the Hibs game. ""He has a tear in his thigh. I'm not sure how long that will keep him out -- two or three weeks maybe,"" Smith said. ""It's disappointing in the sense that he is just back in the team and doing exceptionally well, so it was disappointing it happened."" However, Beasley's international teammate Maurice Edu boosted his chances of playing at next year's World Cup finals in South Africa after making his first appearance this season. The midfielder, who suffered a serious knee injury in the final SPL game of last season, came off the substitutes' bench for the final 15 minutes at Easter Road.","Rangers four points clear despite conceding fastest goal in Scottish Premier League history .

"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday warned participants in the climate change conference in Copenhagen that they are ""running out of time"" to reach an agreement on what to do about global warming. Critics say those attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which began December 7, have made little or no headway toward developing a plan. U.S. officials in Copenhagen and at the White House confirmed that talks broke down Wednesday after the Chinese rejected American demands that they commit to transparency regarding their emissions reductions. Without mentioning China by name, Clinton said their continued refusal would be ""kind of a deal breaker for us."" The uncertainty over whether a deal could be reached before talks end Friday led to speculation that President Barack Obama might not travel to Copenhagen as planned, but White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters he would leave Thursday evening. ""We all know there are real challenges that remain in the hours left to these negotiations,"" Clinton said. ""And it is no secret that we have lost precious time in these past days. In the time we have left here, it can no longer be about us versus them. ""We all face the same challenge together,"" she added. ""We're running out of time. It's unfortunate that there have been problems with the process, difficulties with certain parties being willing to come to the table, all kinds of discussions and disagreements, sometimes about the past rather than about the future."" Without mentioning China by name, Clinton said that nation's continued refusal to come to the table would be ""kind of a deal breaker for us."" Gibbs said the Chinese ""balked"" at the ""strong transparency requirement,"" and he ""hoped they would reconsider."" ""The president is going to travel in hopes of making progress for a strong operational agreement,"" Gibbs said. ""There are no changes in the president's plans."" The agreement Obama is hoping for out of Copenhagen would not be a treaty, nor would it be legally binding. Gibbs acknowledged it would be ""a political agreement that would lead to a treaty"" later. The last time the president traveled to Copenhagen -- in October to try to win the 2012 Olympic bid for Chicago -- he came back empty-handed. ""Coming back with an empty agreement would far worse,"" Gibbs said Thursday. Clinton said the United States is concerned about the ability of needy nations to do their part. The United States is willing to work with other countries to raise $100 billion by 2020 to address the climate-change needs of developing nations, she said. She told delegates that the United States already has joined an effort to provide more immediate funding that would reach $10 billion in 2012. ""After a year of diplomacy, we have come to Copenhagen ready to take the steps necessary to achieve a comprehensive and operational new agreement that will provide a foundation for long-term, sustainable economic growth,"" Clinton said. ""We have now reached the critical juncture in these negotiations. I understand that the talks have been difficult. I know that our team, along with many others, are working hard and around the clock to forge a deal,"" she said. ""But the time is at hand for all countries to reach for common ground and take an historic step that we can all be proud of."" Clinton's announcement was ""enormously encouraging,"" Tim Flannery, an internationally known zoologist, conservationist and explorer, said on CNN's ""Amanpour."" Clinton proposed several core elements that should be included in any plan: decisive national actions; an operational accord ""that internationalizes those actions""; technical and other assistance for needy nations that are ""the most vulnerable and least prepared to meet the effects of climate change; and standards of transparency that provide credibility to the entire process."" ""The world community should accept no less,"" she added. Kandeh Yumkella, director-general of the U.N. Industrial Development Organization, said on ""Amanpour"" he is optimistic that leaders can strike a deal before the conference ends. ""Compared to yesterday, what we have now is that the negotiators have hunkered down,"" he said. ""They're actually in drafting committees."" Flannery agreed. ""If the U.S. can commit to another couple of percent in terms of cuts (in emissions), if the Chinese can increase their efficiency gains by 5 percent, that'll probably be enough to bring the Europeans on board for a 30 percent target, and then we'll be there."" Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who suggested the initial estimate of about $100 billion a year by 2020 to reduce emissions, urged leaders Thursday to reach an agreement that would limit ""long-term, global temperature increases"" to no more than 2 degrees. According to the 10 Downing Street Web site, Brown told the conference that wealthier countries must commit to provide immediate funding for developing countries to reach such a goal. He recommended that financing start in January, with nations providing $10 billion a year by 2012. He called on developing countries to commit to ambitious mitigation actions to handle climate change. ""To the developed world I say: Environmental action is the most powerful engine of job creation in an economy urgently in need of millions of new jobs. ""To the developing world I say: The technology now exists to gain the dividends of a high-growth economy without incurring the damage of a high-carbon economy. ""And to all nations I say: It is not enough for us to do the least we can get away with when history asks that we demand the most of ourselves.""","U.S. joins an effort to mobilize ""fast-start"" funding for developing counties.

"(CNN)  -- The chief justice of the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in favor of an American father in an international custody battle. The ruling by Chief Justice Gilmar Mendes will reunite a 9-year-old boy with his father, David Goldman, who has been locked in a custody battle with the family of the boy's deceased mother. Last week, a lower court unanimously upheld a decision ordering that Sean Goldman be returned to his father in New Jersey. David Goldman arrived in Rio de Janeiro to reunite with his son, but one Supreme Court justice issued a stay, ordering Sean to remain with his Brazilian relatives until the high court could consider the case. Mendes' decision lifted the stay, paving the way for Goldman to be reunited with his son. Sean's grandmother, Silvana Bianchi, was expected to immediately file appeals to Tuesday's ruling. In a letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Bianchi said that the legal process was overlooking the boy's own desires. ""I feel threatened by losing my grandson Sean because of international pressures that don't consider the interest of a 9-year-old child who passionately desires to remain among those that gave him comfort in the mother's death,"" the letter states in part. ""They allege that the Hague Convention determined to hand him over immediately. I am not a lawyer. But what I know is that the Convention establishes as priority the interest of the child, and the child wasn't heard."" The custody battle began in 2004, when Goldman's wife, Bruna Bianchi, took their then-4-year-old son from their home in New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro for what was to have been a two-week vacation. She never returned, instead remarrying there and retaining custody of Sean. She died last year in childbirth. Goldman has argued that as the sole surviving parent, he should be granted custody. The Bianchi family argues it would traumatize Sean to remove him from what has been his home for five years. The custody battle garnered much media attention and spilled over into the political arena as well. U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, had placed a hold on a trade bill that would have benefited Brazil to the tune of $2.75 billion, but he lifted it on the court's ruling, spokesman Caley Gray said. The bill in question, which sailed through the Senate after the senator dropped the hold, would provide export tariff relief to 130 countries, of which Brazil would be the fifth largest recipient, Gray said. Lautenberg's hold was designed to exert additional pressure on Brazilian authorities to abide by the court order to return Sean to his father, he said. While the chief justice was still studying the case, Brazilian Attorney General Luis Inacio Adams said the executive branch sides with Goldman. ""Once we stop cooperating and start breaking our treaties and international obligations, Brazil risks the chance of not having its own requests in the matters regarding international judicial help granted, based on the principle of international reciprocity,"" Adams said Monday. ""Not releasing the minor into the custody of his father could bring sanctions against Brazil,"" he added. ""It could damage Brazil's image before the international community.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Eurostar is running tests to try to figure out what caused an ""unprecedented"" six trains to break down, forcing the company to cancel all services this weekend, a spokeswoman said Sunday. The company announced later that Monday service will be halted as well to allow for more test runs. The cancellation of the England-to-France express train service stranded thousands of passengers on both sides of the English Channel on the weekend before Christmas. ""We sincerely regret having to take this decision and we understand how frustrated and disappointed travelers will be,"" Eurostar said on its Web site Sunday. Five trains with about 2,000 passengers stopped running Friday night inside the Channel Tunnel, also called the Chunnel, which runs between Britain and France. A sixth train broke down Saturday after Eurostar tried to run four trains from London to the continental mainland to prepare for the resumption of normal service. About 700 people were aboard when that train stopped in the Ebbsfleet area of Kent. Eurostar is making an effort to get about 500 people in ""emergency situations"" out of London, a spokesman said. They are being put on a regular train to the coastal town of Dover, England, taken across the English Channel by ferry and then by bus to Brussels or Paris, said the spokesman, who declined to be named. Eurostar is conducting a series of test trains Sunday ""to better understand the problems that have been occurring,"" the company said. ""We are committed to restoring our services as soon as possible but our key priority is the safety and comfort of our customers,"" the statement said. Those passengers affected by the breakdowns are being offered a full refund, another return ticket and 150 pounds in compensation. About 25,000 people should have been traveling on Saturday, Eurostar said. The company is not taking any new bookings until after Christmas, it announced, and is urging people not to come to the station Sunday. ""We strongly recommend that travelers whose journeys are not essential change their tickets for travel on a later date or have their tickets refunded,"" Eurostar said on its Web site. The trains became stuck in the tunnel because the air inside was much warmer than the air outside the tunnel entrance in France, Eurostar spokeswoman Amelle Mouhaddib said. ""It's a bit like taking a bottle of beer out of the fridge into a warm room -- within minutes it's covered in condensation,"" said Eurostar CEO Richard Brown. ""We think that was the principle cause of the electrical failures on the trains."" Brown called the number of breakdowns ""completely unprecedented."" Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel Tunnel, said it evacuated all 1,364 Eurostar passengers who were stuck Friday after the trains ""lost traction,"" but one of the five trains remained in the tunnel and was blocking part of it, according to a Eurotunnel spokeswoman who asked not to be named, in line with policy. The train that broke down Saturday was being towed back to the tunnel entry so passengers could be removed and transferred, Eurostar said. The problems started after 9 p.m. Friday when the first of the five Eurostar trains became stuck. It was helped out of the tunnel by a Eurotunnel locomotive, which took it all the way to London with passengers still on board, the Eurotunnel spokeswoman said. Passengers on the second and third trains to fail were evacuated via the service tunnel to a Eurotunnel train, which brought them to the exit, she said. One of the failed trains was pulled out of the tunnel, but authorities were having difficulty removing the other, she said. The fourth and fifth trains were running close together when they failed, so Eurotunnel locomotives coupled them and either pushed or pulled them to the English side of the tunnel, the spokeswoman said. Passengers from the fifth train boarded the one in front, and Eurotunnel locomotives then towed that train to London, she said. The Chunnel is two tunnels separated by a third and smaller service tunnel, so the train that remained stuck inside did not mean the entire tunnel was blocked, the Eurotunnel spokeswoman said. The Chunnel is 50.5 kilometers (31.4 miles) long, 38 kilometers (23 miles) of which are underwater. Brown said keeping passengers on the trains is the quickest and safest evacuation method. ""Because there were five trains, it took us ... longer than we would wish to get those trains out and those passengers on their way home,"" he said. Despite the stoppage of service Saturday, noncommercial vehicles, including cars, motorbikes, and camper vans, were still able to travel through the tunnel.

The family's attorney, Sergio Tostes, said Friday that the legal battle had gone too far. ""It is about time that Sean's family, and I mean all Sean's family, get together. I am authorized by Mrs. Silvana Bianchi to invite you, Mr. Goldman, to spend Christmas night at her house,"" Tostes said, referring to Sean's maternal grandmother. ""This will be a long awaited family reunion"" ""I hope you can accept and we can talk logistics,"" he said, with the boy's grandmother standing next to him. Tostes also said that the family would consider allowing the boy to go to the United States, perhaps for the holidays, if Sean wants to go. However, ""Sean must be heard in court,"" he said. There was no immediate response from Goldman. Earlier Friday, Goldman slammed a decision by a Brazilian Supreme Court justice Thursday that prevented the boy's return to the United States. That decision had ""nothing to do with the merits"" of the case, he said. On Wednesday, a lower court unanimously upheld a decision ordering that Sean be returned to his father in New Jersey. That decision was made in accordance with the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abductions. ""Every day that my son is under that roof, he is being severely psychologically damaged,"" Goldman said. He insisted that there is the ""utmost urgency"" for Sean to be reunited with him. ""My son is suffering, and he's losing the innocence of ... a child,"" Goldman said. The family argues that it would traumatize Sean to remove him from what has been his home since 2004, when his mother took him to Brazil on what she said would be a vacation. The family said Sean screamed with joy when he found out Thursday that he would not have to leave with his dad. The custody battle began in 2004, when Goldman's wife, Bruna Bianchi, took their then-4-year-old son from their home in New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro for what was to have been a two-week vacation. She never returned, instead remarrying there and retaining custody of Sean. She died last year in childbirth. Goldman has argued that as the sole surviving parent, he should at last be granted custody. Instead of traveling to Brasilia, where the high court is, Goldman planned to stay in Rio de Janeiro on Friday, where he is just miles from Sean. He hasn't seen his son since February. Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, who is traveling with Goldman, said three court-appointed psychologists tasked with determining the boy's emotional and psychological well-being had unanimously concluded that he is being hurt emotionally ""by the continuance of this abduction."" Smith said Sean was previously put in front of a video camera as adults asked questions. The boy made remarks in that video that members of his mother's family suggest indicate he should stay in Brazil. If the court allows a child's drawings or such a videotape to be used as evidence in a courtroom, Smith said, ""every kidnapper everywhere in the world -- every child abductor in the world"" would have the children make such things. Goldman also addressed the videotape: ""What is he going to say? 'No, I hate it here,' knowing he'll go back up under their roof? What do you expect? He is an innocent, helpless, vulnerable, defenseless child that needs to be freed from this circumstance."" Smith called on Brazil's full Supreme Court to ""vacate this illogical and unjust stay on the rightful return of Sean Goldman to his only dad."" If the court does not do so, Smith said, he and Goldman hope Chief Justice Gilmar Mendes will. Smith also said Brazil's Central Authority, which represents interests of the International Court of Justice in the country, planned to appeal to get the justice's stay lifted. Brazil's Central Authority did not immediately return calls seeking comment Friday. Goldman described how he longed to bring his son home in time for Christmas, to play with him in the yard, to go to movies and eat popcorn. Smith said that all the ""surveillance"" present at the time of the February visit -- including a psychologist that the family had ""almost right next to David and Sean the whole time"" -- made it ""an oppressive situation."" ""David ought to be with his son, not on a visit but permanently,"" Smith said. The family has said Goldman can visit his son. ""It's not about going to a compound with a man standing over us, intimidating my son"" and ""making him nervous,"" Goldman said. He added that when his son ""was abducted,"" he would cry, ""I want to be with my dad."" In separating the child from him, ""You poison the child's mind,"" he said. The case has drawn attention worldwide. Smith called it a ""major embarrassment to the Brazilian government."" Goldman said he holds out hope that he will be able to take Sean home so the two ""can go on with our life as father and son."" ""I'm ... begging for justice, begging,"" he said. ""Why is it so hard? Why?"" CNN's Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","NEW: Boy at center of custody dispute may be allowed to go to U.S., family says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two men who worked as security contractors for the company formerly known as Blackwater have been charged with murder in the killings of two Afghan men, federal prosecutors announced Thursday. Christopher Drotleff and Justin Cannon are charged with two counts of second-degree murder and one count of attempted murder each in connection with the May shootings in Kabul. The 12-count, 19-page indictment returned by a federal grand jury in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia also includes weapons charges against the two men. The indictment was returned Wednesday but unsealed Thursday. Both men were in Afghanistan working for the security company Paravant, a subsidiary of Xe, the military contracting firm formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide. FBI agents have arrested both men, the Justice Department announced. Drotleff, Cannon and two other contractors, Steven McClain and Armando Hamid, were involved in the May 5, 2009, shooting that left two Afghan civilians dead and another wounded. The men had been hired by Paravant to help the U.S. Army train Afghan troops. The contractors said they were driving their interpreters on a busy Kabul street called Jalalabad Road at around 9 p.m. when a car slammed into one of their two cars. ""I immediately thought we were under attack,"" McClain said in May. The contractors got out to help their colleagues, and the vehicle that had struck the car did a U-turn and headed back at them, the men said. The contractors fired at the oncoming vehicle. ""The car was coming at us,"" Cannon said in May. ""At that point we attempted to stop and immobilize the vehicle and we engaged it in small arms fire. And the car didn't stop, it just kept going."" The incident spotlights the issue of the role and conduct of U.S. security contractors in Afghanistan. A similar issue arose in Iraq after a September 2007 confrontation involving then-Blackwater contractors that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead. Blackwater lost its contract there after Iraq's government refused to renew its operating license. The company then changed its name to Xe, and it continues to receive multimillion-dollar contracts in Afghanistan. In the wake of the shooting, all four men lost their jobs with Paravant for violating the company's alcohol policy. The contractors said they had not been drinking and had not had a drink since their arrival in November. ""We feel that Blackwater wanted to shift the blame from Blackwater itself to these men as if they were acting on a lark,"" attorney Daniel J. Callahan said in May. ""Off duty, with weapons, weapons of their own, and while drinking. And I think the intent is to use these men as scapegoats."" Callahan, who has advised the men but has not been formally retained by any of them, did not immediately return a call Thursday seeking comment on the charges. In a written statement Thursday, Xe said it had ""immediately and fully cooperated with the government's investigation of this tragic incident and terminated the individuals involved for violating company policy."" Also Thursday, Xe announced it has settled seven lawsuits that accused it of crimes in cases not related to the Afghanistan shooting. The lawsuits accused Blackwater security guards of widespread illegal activity, including fostering ""a culture of lawlessness"" among its guards. A lawyer representing the plaintiffs, Susan Burke, said neither she nor anyone else involved in the settlement was allowed to discuss it publicly. It was not clear how much the settlement was for. One lawsuit, filed by Burke in 2007 on behalf of families of several Iraqis killed or wounded in the September 2007 shooting in Baghdad, Iraq, said that a quarter of Blackwater security guards in Iraq use steroids and other ""judgment-altering substances."" The lawsuit also accused the company of war crimes, wrongful death, assault, negligent hiring and emotional distress. The plaintiffs included two wounded survivors of the Baghdad shooting and the families of five people killed in the incident. Blackwater denied the accusations. Last week, a federal judge dismissed manslaughter charges against five Blackwater security guards involved in the killings, finding that prosecutors wrongly used the men's own statements against them.","Christopher Drotleff, Justin Cannon charged with murder, attempted murder .

"London, England (CNN) -- Passengers on Monday vented their fury at Eurostar management as train services between England and France were canceled for a third day, leaving thousands stranded. The cross-Channel operator said a partial train service would resume Tuesday but that was little comfort to many. ""It's shameful, they gave you 36,000 incorrect pieces of information to get us to leave,"" one passenger named Catherine told Agence France-Presse. ""Each time you speak to someone from Eurostar, they tell you something different."" Catherine was one of roughly 75,000 passengers stranded on either side of the English Channel on one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. ""We have to do everything ourselves, we have to pay for everything and hope we will be reimbursed, but some could not get the money together,"" 27-year-old Deborah told AFP. Tell us about wintry weather near you . Government officials in both France and the United Kingdom also criticized Eurostar. British transport minister Sadiq Khan called the experience terrible for thousands of passengers. ""I am angry that passengers have still not been told what is going on and I have told Eurostar this morning that they must tell the public immediately what their plans are,"" Khan said. ""This has been a terrible experience for thousands of passengers, both those stranded on the trains and at the stations."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy called the disruptions ""unacceptable."" There was some good news though for stranded passengers, as Eurostar said they would resume a partial service Tuesday. ""We're planning on running at two-thirds our normal service tomorrow and we'll take it from there,"" a Eurostar spokesman told CNN. Eurostar runs the high-speed rail service directly linking London to Paris and Brussels via the Channel Tunnel. A later statement from Eurostar said tests on winter weather devices on trains had been successful and that if further trials went well Monday the operator hoped to have 26,000 seats available. However, Nicolas Petrovic, Eurostar chief operation officer said a full service would not resume until after Christmas, according to AFP. Eurostar rail services remained suspended for a third day on Monday as the operator worked to fix a fault that caused a series of breakdowns blamed on winter weather. Following a series of test runs on Sunday, the company said work was under way to ""enhance the snow screens and snow shields in the power cars of the trains."" ""We now understand the cause of the disruption over the weekend and have identified the modifications that are required. As we suspected, the acute weather conditions in northern France have caused the disruption,"" Eurostar said. ""We sincerely regret having to take this decision and we understand how frustrated and disappointed travelers will be, particularly those who have been waiting to travel for the last two days,"" Eurostar said. Five trains with about 2,000 passengers stopped running Friday night inside the tunnel. A sixth train broke down Saturday in Kent, southern England, with about 700 people aboard. ""We were prisoners in this train for like 18 hours,"" one passenger told CNN. The trains that broke down in the tunnel malfunctioned because the air inside was warmer than that outside the tunnel entrance in France, Eurostar spokeswoman Amelle Mouhaddib said. ""It's a bit like taking a bottle of beer out of the fridge into a warm room -- within minutes it's covered in condensation,"" said Eurostar CEO Richard Brown. ""We think that was the principle cause of the electrical failures on the trains."" Brown called the number of breakdowns ""completely unprecedented."" Passengers affected by the breakdowns are being offered a full refund, another return ticket and Â£150 in compensation. The company is not taking any new bookings until after Christmas. The Channel Tunnel is two tunnels separated by a third and smaller service tunnel, so the trains that remained stuck inside did not mean the entire tunnel was blocked. It is 50.5 kilometers (31.4 miles) long, 38 kilometers (23 miles) of which are underwater.

"(CNN) -- A sign synonymous with the Nazi work camps of World War II was stolen overnight from the Auschwitz Concentration Camp memorial in Poland, police said Friday. Police were ""alerted at 5 a.m. local time on Friday by museum guards"" that the infamous sign reading ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" -- ""Work Sets You Free"" in German -- was stolen, according to police spokeswoman Agnieszka Szczygiel. The heavy iron sign ""was removed by being unscrewed on one side and pulled off on the other,"" Szczygiel said. ""It is also believed that this was a planned event and that several people were involved as the sign was at remarkable height."" Police have launched an investigation. The chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum, called the theft shocking. ""While we don't yet know exactly who stole the sign, the theft of such a symbolic object is an attack on the memory of the Holocaust, and an escalation from those elements that would like to return us to darker days,"" said Avner Shalev. ""I call on all enlightened forces in the world -- who fight against anti-semitism, racism, xenophobia and the hatred of the other -- to join together to combat these trends,"" he said. More than 1 million people died in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp complex; about 90 percent of the victims were Jews. Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, called the sign ""the defining symbol of the Holocaust"" and urged authorities to intensify their investigation. ""Everyone knew that this was not a place where work makes you free, but it was the place where millions of men, women, and children were brought for one purpose only -- to be murdered,"" Hier said. ""The audacity and boldness of this crime deserves the full attention of the Polish government."" The center calls itself one of the largest international Jewish human rights organizations.

"(CNN) -- Ferrari driver Felipe Massa will be in Brazil for his home Formula One grand prix on October 18 -- as a special guest to wave the chequered flag. Felipe Massa is still hopeful of competing in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November. Massa is currently on the road to recovery after requiring life-saving surgery towards the end of July following his accident in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix. After completing two days in the Ferrari simulator this week, the 28-year-old is scheduled to drive a 2007-spec car on Monday after undergoing a medical check-up in Paris on Friday, with governing body the FIA in attendance. Massa, who has not ruled out the prospect of driving in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on November 1, will then return to Brazil for the penultimate round on the calendar. Massa will become the third celebrity to wave the chequered flag at Interlagos in the past eight years, following in the footsteps of Pele and model Gisele Bundchen. Hopefully, Massa will at least have his eyes on the conclusion of what could be the title decider, unlike Pele, who famously failed to carry out his duty. The legendary footballer was looking the other way when Michael Schumacher beat his brother Ralf by half-a-second in 2002.","Felipe Massa will be in Brazil for home Formula One grand prix on October 18 .

"(CNN) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom has declared a state of national calamity because so many citizens do not have food or proper nutrition. Sisters Vidalia, left, and Maribel Agustin, who suffer from malnutrition, sit at a shelter in Guatemala in August. Speaking in a nationally televised address late Tuesday, Colom said his declaration will make it easier to get food to the thousands of Guatemalan families who are in dire need. ""This will help us access resources from the international community that are generously offered for this type of situation and to mobilize national resources more rapidly,"" he said. The United Nations' World Food Programme says Guatemala has the fourth highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the world and the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean. Chronic undernutrition affects about half of the nation's children under the age of 5, the U.N. agency said. Colom said the nation's food problems are the result of a drought this year, global warming and the effects of the international economic crisis. He also cited the Central American nation's ""history of unfairness that has made Guatemala live since long ago with high and shameful poverty levels, extreme poverty and undernutrition."" According to the World Bank, about 75 percent of Guatemalans live below the poverty level, which is defined as an income that is not sufficient to purchase a basic basket of goods and basic services. Almost 58 percent of the population have incomes below the extreme poverty line, which is defined as the amount needed to purchase a basic basket of food. ""This is the cause of the food and nutritional crisis that this country is going through,"" Colom said. ""There is food. What we don't have are the financial means so that those who are affected can buy the available food. ... Let's not wait until we have a famine to act."" Poverty is more pronounced among indigenous populations and those who live in rural areas. In the nation's highlands, where many indigenous people live, seven of 10 children under age 5 are malnourished, the World Food Programme says. About 40 percent of the nation's more than 13.2 million citizens are indigenous Mayans, according to the CIA World Fact Book.","Declaration will make it easier to get food to those in need, president says .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court declared on Wednesday that an amnesty that had protected politicians, including President Asif Ali Zardari, from corruption and criminal charges, was unconstitutional. The 17-judge court invalidated the National Reconciliation Order, saying in its ruling that the amnesty ""seems to be against the national interest"" and ""violates various provisions of the Constitution."" The order, passed in October 2007 under then-President Pervez Musharraf, protected thousands of bureaucrats and politicians, including Zardari and his wife, late former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, from corruption and criminal charges. It expired last month. The supreme court said its ruling revived all cases that had been suspended or withdrawn under the amnesty. There was no immediate response from Zardari's government to Wednesday's ruling. However, as president, Zardari still has immunity from prosecution. Although he was never convicted, Zardari spent 11 years in jail on corruption allegations that he called politically motivated. Bhutto had faced corruption charges in at least five cases, but was not convicted. Before her return to Pakistan to take part in the elections in 2007, she had been in self-imposed exile for eight years after being convicted on money-laundering charges. When Bhutto was prime minister, frequent accusations of corruption against her husband, Zadari, of stealing from government coffers and accepting kickbacks, prompted many Pakistanis to derisively label him ""Mr. 10 Percent."" He became the Pakistan People's Party head after Bhutto was assassinated during a campaign rally in December 2007, and he became president eight months later. The PPP had tried in October to extend the amnesty ahead of its deadline, but faced strong protest from opposition parties in parliament. A day ahead of the amnesty's expiration, Zardari told Pakistan's Express News that he still had immunity as president and wasn't concerned about the reopening of cases against him. The president's spokesman echoed that sentiment in November. ""The president is absolutely not concerned,"" presidential spokesman Farhatullah Baber told CNN. ""It's whatever the courts decide. We will cross that bridge when it comes,"" Baber said.","Pakistan's Supreme Court declares amnesty protecting politicians is unconstitutional .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Investigators believe the suspected gunman in last week's massacre at Fort Hood acted alone, but his communications had been flagged by U.S. intelligence agencies in late 2008, the FBI said Monday. The suspect, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, remained in intensive care at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. In a statement issued Monday night, the FBI said its investigation so far ""indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot."" Thursday's shooting left 13 dead, 12 of them U.S. soldiers, and 42 wounded. Read more about the victims . Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. He was promoted to major in May and was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan sometime soon, but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military. A Muslim, he had told his family he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In August, he reported to police that his car was keyed and a bumper sticker that read ""Allah is Love"" was torn off. A neighbor was charged with criminal mischief after that complaint. But the FBI disclosed that Hasan came to its attention as part of an unrelated terrorism probe in December 2008, when agents reviewed ""certain communications between Maj. Hasan and the subject of that investigation."" The intercepts ""raised no red flags,"" with no mention of threats or violence that would have triggered a U.S. terrorism investigation, senior investigative officials said Monday. Hasan, 39, was wounded several times during the attack. Though still in intensive care, his ventilator was removed over the weekend, and he began talking afterwards, hospital spokesman Dewey Mitchell said. Federal agents attempted to interview Hasan on Sunday, but he refused to cooperate and asked for an attorney, the investigative officials said. U.S. military officials said intelligence agencies intercepted communications between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, a former imam at the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia, a Washington suburb. Al-Awlaki, who left the United States in 2002 and is believed to be living in Yemen, was the subject of several federal investigations dating back to the late 1990s, but was never charged. Military officials told CNN on Monday that intelligence agencies intercepted communications from Hasan to al-Awlaki and shared them with other U.S. government agencies. But federal authorities dropped the inquiry into Hasan's communications after deciding that the messages warranted no further action, one of the officials said. According to the FBI, investigators from one of its Joint Terrorism Task Forces determined ""that the content of those communications was consistent with research being conducted by Maj. Hasan in his position as a psychiatrist at the Walter Reed Medical Center [in Washington]."" Hasan was first an intern, then a resident and finally a fellow at Walter Reed before moving to Fort Hood. ""Because the content of the communications was explainable by his research and nothing else derogatory was found, the JTTF concluded that Maj. Hasan was not involved in terrorist activities or terrorist planning,"" it said. FBI Director Robert Mueller has ordered a review of the matter, the FBI said. The independent commission that investigated the 9/11 attacks found al-Awlaki was a ""spiritual adviser"" to two of the hijackers in that plot, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Midhar, while al-Awlaki was at the Virginia mosque and earlier, in San Diego. The commission report said it was not clear whether the imam knew al-Hazmi and al-Midhar were involved in the hijacking plot, but security experts have described him as a radical Islamic fundamentalist who was ""very supportive of terrorists in the past,"" former White House homeland security adviser Frances Townsend told CNN. An online post attributed to al-Awlaki praised Hasan as a hero for the Fort Hood attack, saying he ""could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people."" But the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque denounced al-Awlaki's remarks, and its current imam said he was stunned to hear Hasan was the suspect in the rampage. ""The quiet, very peaceful person coming in and out of the mosque, I couldn't believe he could have done this,"" Sheikh Shaker Elsayed told CNN. Three senior investigative officials, who insisted they not be identified by name because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing federal investigation, told reporters in Washington that Hasan was never nominated to be on a watch list. He was able to purchase weapons legally and had done nothing to justify even a preliminary investigation, they said. In addition, Hasan had a security clearance at the ""secret"" level and received good performance reviews, they said. Nonetheless, they continued to examine his communications with the cleric in Yemen for several months as a precaution. Authorities have not identified a motive in Thursday's attack. But at Fort Hood the post commander told reporters he has ordered his officers to ""immediately take a hard look and make sure if there's anybody out there struggling."" ""Hasan was a soldier and we have other soldiers ... that might have some of the same stress and indicators that he has,"" Lt. Gen. Robert Cone said. ""We have to look across our entire formation, not just in a medical community but really look hard to our right and left. That's the responsibility for everybody from the top to the bottom to make sure we're taking care of our own."" Army officials have voiced concern about jumping to any conclusions about Hasan's motive, warning about a possible backlash against Muslim soldiers. But several witnesses, like Pvt. Robert Foster, who was wounded in the hip during the attack, reported Hasan shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" -- Arabic for ""God is great"" -- which Islamic terrorists have used as a battle cry. ""I was sitting in about the second row back when the assailant stood up and yelled 'Allah Akbar' in Arabic and he opened fire,"" Foster, 21, said Monday on CNN's ""American Morning."" The Army leadership at Fort Hood will ""take a very hard look at ourselves and look at anything that might have been done to have prevented this,"" Cone said Monday. ""I think what we're looking for are sort of people with overwhelming personal problems and patterns of behavior that are not at all related to religion,"" Cone said. No charges have been filed against Hasan. The investigative officials who briefed reporters said he was likely to be charged in the military court system. President Obama will speak at Tuesday's memorial service for the shooting victims at Fort Hood, and will meet with victims' families, his spokesman said. ""The president will meet with families of those that lost a loved one last week, as well as speak to the larger memorial that will take place at the base,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in his daily briefing Monday. First lady Michelle Obama will accompany the president on the trip, Gibbs said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates will also participate in the memorial service, but he will not speak, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Hundreds of investigations of online child sexual exploitation and child pornography have been significantly delayed by backlogs at FBI cybercrime labs, according to a Justice Department report released Friday. FBI Inspector General Glenn Fine says processing time for digital evidence can take up to nine months. An audit conducted more than a year ago by the department's inspector general found 353 requests awaiting digital evidence analysis. FBI computer forensic personnel on average took about 60 days to examine evidence needed by investigators, the report says. ""The processing time for the digital evidence in some cases could take up to nine months, which we concluded was too long,"" Inspector General Glenn Fine said. The digital evidence involves online communications in which potential child predators and sex offenders target juveniles for sexual exploitation or produce cyber-based child pornography. The FBI acknowledged the challenge of keeping up with the growing problem, but said it has made improvements since the audit was conducted. ""The pervasiveness of the Internet has resulted in the dramatic growth of online sexual exploitation of children, resulting in a 2,000 percent increase in the number of cases opened since 1996,"" FBI Executive Assistant Director Stephen Tidwell said. From 2003 to 2007, the number of crimes against children reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's hot line rose from 7,038 to 20,760, the report states. Since its inception in 1995, the Innocent Images Unit has investigated more than 20,000 online cases resulting in 7,000 convictions. Tidwell said the FBI has begun implementing a series of procedural and technical recommendations made by the inspector general to reduce the lab backlogs and improve efficiencies in other programs designed to combat crimes against children. The other programs include wide-ranging investigations of child abductions and kidnappings by parents as well as strangers. The report says the largest number of missing children cases involve runaways from juvenile homes. The most recent government study says 99.8 percent of children reported missing were located or returned home alive. The number of child abductions investigated by the FBI during this decade has topped 2,000. Abductions by strangers amount to only a fraction of 1 percent of total kidnapping cases.","Audit finds 353 requests awaiting digital evidence analysis .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- A mother whose daughter and granddaughter attend Oprah Winfrey's school in South Africa considers the talk-show host heaven-sent, despite allegations of abuse being investigated there. Oprah Winfrey cuts the ribbon at the opening in January of her Leadership Academy in South Africa. ""Oprah is an angel, she is God-sent,"" Masechaba Hine said Wednesday from her small home in gritty Soweto township. ""She came to my rescue when my husband was not working."" Hine's daughter Palesa and her granddaughter Alebohang, both 14, were among the 152 students chosen to be the first class to attend the high-tech, high-profile Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls when it opened in January. Her faith remains unshaken by the news that South African police have opened a criminal investigation into allegations that a dorm parent mistreated students at the school. Hine said her children ""have no problems about the school, they are happy about everything."" Investigators declined to provide details of the alleged abuse, but the academy's CEO, John Samuel, said in a statement issued earlier this month that an internal inquiry was launched based on a claim of misconduct involving a dormitory parent.  Watch why school is being investigated Â» . According to an article in The Cape Argus, a Cape Town newspaper, the dorm parent allegedly grabbed a pupil by the throat and threw her against a wall, the girl claimed. Girls at the school also claimed that the matron swore and screamed at the girls and assaulted them, the newspaper reported Saturday. The newspaper said one of the pupils ran away from the school, blaming the alleged abuse. Winfrey personally selected the school's students, all of them straight-A students from underprivileged backgrounds. The students get free tuition, free uniforms, free accommodation and free meals at the school in Henley-on-Klip, near Johannesburg. In Hine's case, her children's status as the ""poorest of the poor"" that the school aims to serve was clear-cut: Hine supports the five people who live in her small two-bedroom Soweto home on the $50 a week she makes from a fruit and vegetable stand. Hine also is caring for two other orphans -- a niece and a younger granddaughter -- as well as Palesa and Alebohang, whom Hine took responsibility for when her own mother died of AIDS. Along with the money she scrapes together, the family survives on food baskets they receive once a month from a charity. Hine attended an emergency meeting with Winfrey when the talk-show host came to the school two weeks ago. ""She was emotional, she was crying when she was talking about her daughters. It is not our daughters anymore, it is Oprah's daughters,"" Hine said. Winfrey did not give the parents details of the allegations other than to say that the dormitory parent ""didn't treat the girls the way she likes,"" Hine said. She said parents were told at the start of the meeting that Winfrey ""does not want the thing to be in the media. It was a private meeting."" The controversy that now surrounds the school now offers a sharp contrast to the glitter and air of limitless hope when Winfrey brought a gaggle of Hollywood stars with her to officially open the well-appointed school. The criminal probe was opened after a team of three American experts hired by Winfrey gave police the results of their initial investigation, police said. ""We came to the conclusion that there were criminal elements and then we opened the case for investigation,"" said Police Superintendent Lungelo Dlamini. Dlamini told CNN that the team of U.S. experts hired by Winfrey to conduct the internal investigation included Robert Farley, a retired Cook County, Illinois, detective. He said two American social workers were also on the team. Previously, Winfrey -- who has spoken publicly about the abuse she suffered as a child -- issued a statement on October 17 saying, ""Nothing is more serious or devastating to me than an allegation of misconduct by an adult against any girl at the academy."" In the statement, Samuel said South African child protection services were notified and the dorm parent was removed from the campus. ""We have engaged professional investigators of the highest standing from South Africa and the United States to conduct a fair and impartial inquiry into these claims,"" the statement said. The school's head has agreed to take a paid leave of absence pending the results of the investigation, although she is not the subject of the allegation, Samuel said. The national prosecuting authority is deciding whether criminal charges will be filed. In an October 23 statement, Samuel referred inquiries to the South African Child Protection Services Unit.

"(CNN) -- Evangelist Tony Alamo is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison after an Arkansas judge sentenced him to 175 years Friday on charges that included taking minors across state lines for sex, according to prosecutors. A jury convicted Alamo in July on 10 federal counts covering offenses that spanned 11 years and dated back to 1994, according to documents from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. Alamo, the 75-year-old founder and leader of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries, will serve the sentences on each count consecutively, for a total of 175 years in prison, prosecutors said. In addition to his sentence, Alamo was fined $250,000, court documents showed. His lawyer filed an appeal Friday. Christopher Plumlee, assistant U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, welcomed the sentence. ""Given the number of victims and the difficult type of testimony they had to provide in order to get to trial, it's gratifying for them to see him get this sentence,"" he said. ""Not only did they entrust their lives to him, he did it in the name of God. And he betrayed their trust."" Authorities in September 2008 arrested Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Hoffman, and raided his 15-acre compound near Texarkana, Arkansas. An indictment released in November 2008 accused Alamo of transporting five girls across state lines for sex. The criminal complaint included accounts from three girls, two of whom were 17 when the complaint was released last year, and one who was 14. All three said Alamo sexually abused them. In a phone interview last year with CNN, Alamo called the accusations a hoax. ""They're just trying to make our church look evil ... by saying I'm a pornographer. Saying that I rape little children. ... I love children. I don't abuse them. Never have. Never will.""","Charges included taking minors across state lines for sex .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, warned Thursday of an indication of an attack to Bali on New Year's Eve. The Embassy said the warning initially came from the Bali governor, Mangku Pastika, and that it passed on his alert verbatim. The governor, however, said there was no information about a new terrorist threat. ""We never release(d) any warning related to terror on New Year's Eve,"" the governor's office said in a statement after the Embassy released the warning. ""We however encourage both domestic and foreign tourists to be cautious,"" the governor's office said. ""The terrorists hit Bali twice. Who knows what they will do next."" Pastika's office said there was only a general alert on the island because of the holiday. Terrorist groups, including Jemaah Islamiyah, have carried out repeated attacks in Bali and elsewhere in Indonesia since 2002. The Embassy did not elaborate on the governor's message, but the United States has a standing warning to U.S. citizens in Indonesia that extremists may target both official and private interests, including hotels, clubs, and shopping centers. ""In their work and daily living activities, and while traveling, U.S. citizens should be vigilant and prudent at all times,"" the U.S. State Department warning states. ""We urge U.S. citizens to monitor local news reports, vary their routes and times, and maintain a low profile. U.S. citizens must consider the security and safety preparedness of hotels, residences, restaurants, and entertainment or recreation venues that they frequent."" Unknown attackers shot at foreigners in Banda Aceh, in northern Sumatra, last month, wounding a European development worker, the Embassy said. The attackers also targeted a house occupied by American teachers, but no U.S. citizens were hurt, it said. The most major recent attack was in July, when suspected Jemaah Islamiyah elements bombed two western hotels in Jakarta. The blasts at the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels killed nine people -- including at least two presumed suicide bombers -- and wounded more than 50, including U.S. citizens. Also in July, armed assailants in Papua killed several people, including security personnel and one Australian national, the Embassy said. Jemaah Islamiyah, said to have links to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network, is blamed for the 2002 Bali bomb attacks in which 202 people, mainly foreign tourists, were killed. More than 300 people -- many of them young Australians on vacation -- were wounded by the massive blasts in the town of Kuta. Dozens of victims were burned beyond recognition or blown to pieces. The bombing was blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah. The group was also said to be behind an attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta in 2004 in which nine people died, and an attack on the same Marriott hotel that killed eight the same year. -- CNN's Atika Shubert in Bali and Andy Saputra in Jakarta contributed to this report.","U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, warns of an indication of an attack on Bali on New Year's Eve .

"Washington (CNN) -- Computer technicians have recovered about 22 million Bush administration e-mails that the Bush White House had said were missing, two watchdog groups that sued over the documents announced Monday. The e-mails date from 2003 to 2005, and had been ""mislabeled and effectively lost,"" according to the National Security Archive, a research group based at George Washington University. But Melanie Sloan, executive director of the liberal-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said it could be years before most of the e-mails are made public. ""The e-mails themselves are not what we're getting,"" Sloan said. Documents related to the handling of e-mail under the Bush administration and subsequent information regarding how White House e-mails are currently archived will be released under a settlement with the Obama administration, which inherited a lawsuit the groups filed in 2007. But the National Archives must sort out which documents are covered by the Freedom of Information Act and which ones fall under the Presidential Records Act, which means they could be withheld for five to 10 years after the Bush administration left office in January, Sloan said. ""The National Archives will sort this out,"" she said. The e-mail controversy dates back to the Bush administration's 2006 firing of the top federal prosecutors in nine cities. After congressional committees demanded the administration produce documents related to the firings, the White House said millions of e-mails might have been lost from its servers. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive sued over the issue in 2007, arguing the Bush administration violated federal laws that require presidential records to be preserved. Court records have shown that the Bush administration knew about the e-mail problems as far back as 2005 and did nothing to fix them, Sloan said. ""They never made an effort to restore them,"" she said. But Scott Stanzel, a former deputy press secretary in the Bush White House, said the group ""has consistently tried to create a spooky conspiracy out of standard IT issues."" ""We always indicated that there is an e-mail archiving system and a disaster recovery system,"" Stanzel said. ""We also indicated that e-mails not properly archived could be found on disaster recovery tapes. There is a big, big difference between something not being properly archived and it being 'lost' or 'missing,' as CREW would say."" Monday's settlement allows for 94 days of e-mail traffic, scattered between January 2003 to April 2005, to be restored from backup tapes. Of those 94 days, 40 were picked by statistical sample; another 21 days were suggested by the White House; and the groups that filed suit picked 33 that seemed ""historically significant,"" from the months before the invasion of Iraq to the period when the firings of U.S. attorneys were being planned. Also requested were several days surrounding the announcement that a criminal investigation was under way into the disclosure of then-CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson's identity. That investigation led to the conviction of White House aide I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby on charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to federal agents investigating the leak. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington represented Wilson and her husband, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, in a lawsuit over her exposure, which they argued was in retaliation for his accusation that the Bush administration over-hyped the intelligence used to justify the invasion of Iraq. A federal judge dismissed the case on procedural grounds in 2007, but Sloan said the missing e-mails raise the ""strong possibility"" that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald never received all the documents he requested during the leak investigation.","White House had said that about 22 million Bush administration e-mails were missing .

Objections to Southers' confirmation were first made by Republican Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina over the potential unionization of TSA employees. Southers is the Los Angeles International Airport's assistant chief for homeland security and intelligence. The airport's police department, which Southers has helped manage since early 2007, is the largest such operation in the country, with approximately 1,200 employees.

Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story.

"(CNN) -- When Tyra Smith's boyfriend, Chris Lewis, first suggested they be guinea pigs in a H1N1 vaccination study in August, she wasn't so crazy about the idea. But then she warmed to it: While she doesn't like needles, she thought she'd help out because she knew H1N1 was a serious virus. To cut your risk of catching a bug, doctors say wash your hands and avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes. ""I heard people might die from it,"" Smith said. ""So I think it's a good idea to help people, by being involved."" Lewis and Smith, both from Baltimore, Maryland, were among the first Americans to receive H1N1 flu shots. As part of a trial of 2,400 people, they gave blood samples and kept diaries of their symptoms, all in an effort to get an H1N1 vaccine ready for the fall. Now that the results from this and other trials are in, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced that the FDA has approved applications from four manufacturers to make H1N1 flu vaccine, which should be ready for high-risk patients by October 15. She said there will be enough vaccine available for everyone eventually. And that's just in time. With fall in the air and old man winter right around the corner, seasonal flu and the common cold are sure to follow -- and H1N1 is here; in its most recent H1N1 update, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 21 states are reporting widespread flu activity. This cold and flu season could star a cornucopia of viruses. Doctors say they worry the two flu strains (H1N1 and seasonal) could combine, further complicating the situation. Mix in colds, which are prevalent this time of year, and the immune system of Americans could be dealt a one-two punch. So, how can someone tell if those sniffles they're having is something to be concerned about? Infectious disease experts say people need to be aware of the symptoms. Dr. Shmuel Shoham, an infectious-disease specialist at Washington Hospital Center, says the common cold, seasonal flu and H1N1 are all respiratory illnesses, but they're caused by different viruses. Symptoms of the cold are more common, and can make the patient miserable for three to five days. A patient usually has a stuffy nose, congestion, some body aches and a growing cough. According to the CDC seasonal flu and H1N1 symptoms consist of fever, more painful body aches, dry cough, diarrhea and severe fatigue. It's hard, without testing, to tell apart the seasonal strain of flu from the H1N1 variety.  Watch more on cold, flu and H1N1 symptoms Â» . ""People need to take notice when they begin to feel bad. If they start to have respiratory problems, or are dehydrated because of a bug, they should go to the doctor. It could be H1N1 or seasonal influenza,"" says Shoham. ""Some people with influenza can get very sick and could end up in the hospital if it's not taken care of."" People at greatest risk for catching H1N1 include young people ages 6 months to 25 years, pregnant women, and people with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes or heart and lung disease. The CDC recommends that these groups -- as well as health care workers -- get vaccinated first. The seasonal influenza vaccination is especially important for people at high risk of serious flu complications, according to the CDC, including children ages 6 months to 18 years, people with immune system problems, women who plan on being pregnant during the flu season, those 50 years and older and health care workers. But if someone doesn't fall into these categories, it doesn't mean he or she should skip vaccinations altogether. Experts say everyone should get both flu shots. ""It's the best way to protect yourself,"" Shoham says. Other than flu shots, are there other ways to stay healthy and avoid all of these bugs? Doctors say wash your hands and keep your fingers away from your mouth, nose and eyes. If you sneeze, sneeze into your elbow so as not to transfer your germs to your hands -- and everything else around you. As for the myth about avoiding cold drafts -- forget it. ""It doesn't seem to play out that sleeping with the window open, going out with your hair wet in the cold affects your immune system,"" Shoham says. Also, keep your immune system healthy. That translates to eating well, getting enough sleep and staying active. If you become ill and experience severe symptoms, see your doctor. Your physician may recommend antiviral drugs that can treat the flu. Antiviral drugs are prescription medicines (pills, liquid or an inhaled powder) that fight the flu by keeping the virus from reproducing in your body. Above all, stay away from others. If you have the flu, the CDC recommends you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone. It's the best way to keep others from getting infected.","Seasonal flu, H1N1 and common cold will all be around this flu season .

"(CNN) -- An Alaska judge has denied Bristol Palin's request that her court fight with ex-boyfriend Levi Johnston over custody of their son be kept private to avoid a ""media circus."" The daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is seeking full custody of 1-year-old Tripp, contending that Johnston is too immature to be a responsible father and that his mother's felony drug conviction makes her a danger to the child. Bristol Palin filed for full custody in November, but Johnston is seeking shared custody. Both parents are 19. Their teenage relationship fell under an intense public spotlight after Sen. John McCain picked Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate in August 2008. Court documents, now unsealed, were published online Monday by the Anchorage Daily News. Johnston joined the family at the Republican National Convention after the campaign confirmed that Bristol, then 17, was five months pregnant with his child. The couple broke off their engagement about two months after their son's birth in December 2008. Johnston has asked that the case conducted in public to protect himself from Sarah Palin, whom he said was ""powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive."" But Bristol Palin's request that the case be sealed said public proceedings ""will turn this custody case into a media circus which is not in Tripp's best interest."" ""In this day and age of the Internet, media stories remain available for years, even decades, after they are first published, and anything printed in the media (whether it is true or not) will be available to Tripp when he is old enough to read,"" Palin said in a sworn affidavit. She said Johnston wanted a public case so he could ""continue to make a spectacle of this custody dispute for his own self-promotion."" Johnston was set to take part in a reality show in Alaska, she said. ""I do not believe that it would be in Tripp's best interest for Levi's reality show to be filming this case as it unfolds, or for Levi Johnston to be capitalizing off of this custody case through his reality show,"" Palin said. Johnston's sworn statement said he feared what Sarah Palin might do against him if the case were kept secret. ""I really think that closing the court could make this matter very uncivil and potentially open the door for poor influences on Bristol and her attorney that may be extremely inappropriate and potentially harmful to Tripp,"" he said. While Johnston said his former girlfriend would never be malicious toward him, ""her mother is powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive."" ""So, I think a public case might go a long way in reducing Sarah Palin's instinct to attack and allow the real parties in this litigation, Bristol and I, to work things out a lot more peacefully than we could if there is any more meddling from Sarah Palin,"" Johnston said. Bristol Palin's affidavit said her mother is not involved in the custody case, except as a grandmother. But Johnston's lawyer, Rex Butler, said in his own affidavit that his client does not trust closed proceedings because ""Sarah Palin is known to deal forcefully with those she perceives as political enemies."" ""He feels Sarah Palin, through her lawyer, under the guise of Bristol Palin's name, would run roughshod over his very bones,"" Butler said. The judge's ruling, signed last week, concludes that Bristol Palin ""failed to demonstrate that this case involves 'matters of a sensitive and highly personal nature' of such a magnitude that 'protection of the party's name outweighs the public's interest in disclosure.' "" Her filing for full custody argued that Levi was ""not ready for the demands of parenthood and the sacrifices that would entail to a 19-year-old aspiring actor/model."" ""Levi remains without a regular job or steady source of income,"" the petition states. While he's not enrolled in school ""to learn a trade or earn a degree,"" he has made money by selling stories about his son and the Palins to news outlets and engaged in ""risque modeling for Playgirl magazine,"" it states. The photos published last month showed Johnston in semi-nude poses, not with the full frontal nudity that's Palin's filing cited. The petition cited a series of messages posted on the online social network Twitter.com as evidence that Johnston ""may have substance abuse issues, based on statements he has made about seeking 'weed.' "" Johnston's response said he does not have a Twitter account ""and has made no such statements about the use of marijuana."" But Palin's harshest attack was on Levi's mother, Sherry Johnston, who pleaded guilty to a felony drug charge earlier this year. Palin asked that the paternal grandmother be barred from having any unsupervised visitation with Tripp. Her petition said she ""may re-offend, keep medications around the house which could be accessible to the baby, have illegal drug users come to the house (or she could take the baby in her car during a drug sale)."" Palin also said that since Sherry Johnston ""could fall asleep or be too drowsy to appropriately monitor the baby."" ""She is also a chronic pain patient and undergoes daily, regular and sustained narcotic infusions,"" Palin's petition said. Johnston's response said his mother's ""chronic pain condition is currently being managed in coordination with the Department of Corrections."" ""Sherry Johnston will not be left to take care of the minor child alone, but will simply be there to assist to the best of her ability,"" Johnston's filing said. She was released from an Alaska prison last week to serve the remainder of her three-year sentence under house arrest at her home in Wasilla, Alaska. She must wear an ankle bracelet for electronic monitoring, Corrections Department spokesman Richard Schmitz said.","Levi Johnston is seeking shared custody of Tripp Palin, now a year old .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama won Guam's Democratic presidential caucuses Saturday by just seven votes, according to a Guam election official. Voters line up Saturday in Dededo, Guam's largest village. With all 21 precincts reporting, Obama finished with 2,264 votes, or 50.1 percent. Sen. Hillary Clinton got 2,257 votes, or 49.9 percent. Each candidate picked up two delegates. The presidential candidates were battling for Guam's four pledged delegate votes. Eight delegates will be elected, each with half a vote at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, this summer. According to CNN's latest estimate, Obama now has a total of 1,736 delegates (1,493 pledged delegates, 243 superdelegates). Clinton has a total of 1,599 delegates (1,334 pledged delegates, 265 superdelegates). The Democratic contest moves to North Carolina and Indiana, which hold their primaries Tuesday. Also on the ballot Saturday was the race for chairman and vice chairman of the U.S. territory's Democratic Party. The winners of that race will serve as superdelegates. According to the election official, the slate of Pilar Lujan and Jaime Paulino leads the slate of Joseph Artero Cameron and Arlen Bordallo. Lujan remains uncommitted in the race for president, but running mate Paulino has endorsed Obama. Both Cameron and Bordallo have endorsed Clinton. Incumbent Chairman Tony Charfauros and running mate Mary Ann Cabrera are in third place. Neither has endorsed a presidential candidate. Although called ""caucuses,"" Saturday's event in Guam functions more like a party-run primary. Voters cast secret ballots in polling places as opposed to publicly aligning themselves in presidential candidate preference groups, as in more traditional caucuses, such as in Iowa and Nevada. Polls closed in Guam at 6 a.m. ET. Guam is 14 hours ahead of Eastern time. Cathleen Moore-Linn stood in line for more than an hour outside the old police precinct in Dededo, Guam's most populated village. Despite the 90-degree tropical heat and a lack of air conditioning at the polling site, she said, ""Nobody left. A lot of manamko' [elderly people] came out to vote. And people were filling out the forms to join the Democrat Party."" At villages in the southern end of the island, which is far less populated, election committee member Nancy Weare says the voting is running smoothly. ""There's a constant flow of traffic and good voter turnout."" Vying for Guam's delegate and superdelegate votes in their tight race for the nomination, the two remaining Democratic presidential hopefuls have inundated the island with radio and TV advertisements, each promising long-awaited political gains: the ability for Guamanians to be able to vote for president, lifting the territory's cap on Medicaid and, perhaps the most coveted prize of all, war reparations in the form of more than $120 million. A war reparations bill, sponsored by Bordallo, would issue payments to the survivors of Japan's control of the island during World War II and would create educational and research programs about the occupation. The legislation is stalled in the U.S. Senate.

"(CNN) -- Militants who control parts of Somalia's capital city are beating women in broad daylight for violating their radical brand of Islamic law, according to local officials and witnesses in Mogadishu. ""Just today, Al-Shabaab dispatched men with whips to the streets around Bakara market and they are flogging any woman who is found not wearing socks,"" according to a female maize trader at the Mogadishu market, who spoke Thursday. She did not want to be named for security reasons. In the past two days, more than 130 people, including women who were not wearing headscarves and men chewing dried khat leaves, have been detained for violating Al-Shabaab's interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law, according to witnesses and officials. Hooded Al-Shabaab gunmen rounded up 50 women on Wednesday from Mogadishu's Bakara market for not wearing the veil that is required for women under some interpretations of Islamic law, according to the maize trader. ""Most of these women were vegetable traders, so they are poor and can't afford to buy veils for 600,000 shillings [about $23 U.S.],"" she said. She said she saw more women being detained Thursday. Another 80 Somali civilians were detained in the southwestern town of Luuq, near the Kenyan and Ethiopian border, ""because they turned deaf ear to orders we imposed on the town,"" said the local Al-Shabaab commander Sheikh Hussien al-Iraqi. Al-Shabaab is considered a terrorist organization by the United States because of its ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. It has been imposing stricter rules on Somali civilians living in the areas it controls. Earlier this month, Al-Shabaab militants whipped women for wearing bras in an area of northern Mogadishu that they control, shocking residents who have been besieged by the ongoing insurgency. The militants believe the female undergarments are a deception to men.","Militant group Al-Shabaab imposes strict interpretation of law in areas it controls .

A viewer of ""America's Most Wanted"" recognized descriptions of Merhige and his car, authorities said at a news conference early Sunday. Officers immediately responded to the tip late Saturday, surrounding a small motel in the Middle Keys, part of the Florida Keys. Merhige, who had apparently been at the Monroe County motel since December 2, did not resist apprehension by U.S. marshals, authorities said. It was not immediately clear whether he was armed when marshals burst into his motel room, more than 200 miles from Jupiter. Merhige made a first appearance in a West Palm Beach, Florida, court later Sunday morning in a hearing that lasted only minutes, according to CNN affiliate WPTV. He is charged with four counts of premeditated murder and attempted first-degree murder. Asked by the judge if he had anything to say, Merhige declined comment, WPTV said. His next court appearance is scheduled for February 1. He will be held without bond at the Palm Beach County jail. Jim Sitton, father of 6-year-old Makayla, who was killed, told CNN affiliate WPTV late Saturday that he would ""sleep a little better tonight."" ""I won't be patrolling my house with a shotgun, looking for the monster. ... I've been in protective mode,"" he said. ""This doesn't bring Makayla back. I'm not jumping for joy. Her room is still empty. But the monster is in a cage now."" The ""America's Most Wanted"" tipster told authorities that Merhige had checked into the Edgewater Lodge motel under the name John Baca and provided an address in Homestead, Florida, according to a news release from police in Jupiter, Florida. No one at the motel was immediately available for comment, but its Web site included photos of waterfront rooms, efficiencies and townhouses starting at $89 a night. Merhige had paid cash at least two weeks in advance, the U.S. Marshals Service said in a news release. He was on a computer when marshals burst into his second-story room. Merhige had tried to disguise his 2007 Blue Toyota Camry with a car cover and had switched its vehicle tag with one from another car he'd owned, the statement said. He also had shaved his head in an attempt to disguise his identity, the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said. Last month, the marshals added Merhige to their list of the Top 15 most-wanted fugitives. A total of $100,000 was offered as a reward for information leading to Merhige's arrest, the sheriff's office said, and the tipster may be entitled to it. The agency also released some distinguishing characteristics about Merhige, saying he was known to either fake or display symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, such as frequent bathing and shaving, and difficulty making decisions. He also had faked or displayed symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, and taken several prescription drugs for the ailments, the agency said.","Viewer tip led to arrest of man suspected of fatally shooting four relatives on Thanksgiving .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama should end a longstanding policy of not writing letters of condolence to families of troops who commit suicide, dozens of lawmakers urged him in a letter Wednesday. The lawmakers warned that ""our armed forces are in the midst of a suicide epidemic."" U.S. Army statistics show that more than 200 troops have killed themselves this year, more than in 2008, which was a record year. ""By overturning this policy on letters of condolence to the families of suicide victims, you can send a strong signal that you will not tolerate a culture in our armed forces that discriminates against those with a mental illness,"" the lawmakers wrote. The White House has begun a review of the condolence policy, which the 46 members of Congress said should be completed as soon as possible. They also argued the policy of treating suicides differently from deaths in action flew in the face of military funeral procedure, which treats both the same. Service members who kill themselves get ""a full military burial, complete with flag-draped coffin and 21-gun salute. We have not heard of any reports that military morale and discipline have waned as a result,"" they wrote. They also argued that letters of condolence are ""as much about respect for the personal loss that a family experiences as it is about an acknowledgment by our nation that we have lost a soldier."" The White House said two weeks ago its review of the policy should ""hopefully"" conclude shortly. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the president himself asked for the review. ""If the president didn't care, the policy would remain unchanged and unexamined,"" Gibbs said at a December 9 news conference. Despite this year's rise in suicides, Army officials said a recent trend downward could signal progress in programs intended to reduce the problem. Between January and mid-November, 140 active-duty soldiers killed themselves, as did 71 Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers. That's a total of 211 as of November 17, when Gen. Peter Chiarelli, the Army vice chief of staff, briefed reporters about the problem. But he said the monthly numbers are starting to slow down as the year nears its end. ""This is horrible, and I do not want to downplay the significance of these numbers in any way,"" Chiarelli said. For all of 2008, the Army said 140 active-duty soldiers killed themselves, while 57 Guard and Reserve soldiers committed suicide, totaling 197. While the lawmakers cited attitudes toward the mentally ill, the Army is still trying to tackle why soldiers are killing themselves. ""We still haven't found any statistically significant causal linkage that would allow us to effectively predict human behavior. The reality is, there is no simple answer -- each suicide case is as unique as the individuals themselves,"" Chiarelli said. He also said there were troubling new statistics showing an increase in suicide rates among young soldiers who have never deployed, another factor puzzling Army researchers. CNN's Adam S. Levine, Larry Shaughnessy, Mike Mount and Elaine Quijano contributed to this report.","Forty-six members of Congress ask President Obama to revise policy .

"(CNN) -- ""Let me tell you a little about me."" ""Farouk1986"" introduced himself to a Muslim online community with these words in February 2005. ""My name is Umar but you can call me Farouk,"" the poster continues, detailing biographical information that appears to match the life of Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the 23-year-old Nigerian man accused of attempting to detonate an explosive on an international flight into Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day. The failed terror plot put airports on high alert and refocused American attention on al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which claimed responsibility for the attempted attack. Internet postings for Farouk1986 -- apparently a combination of his name and birth year -- reveal a young man who fought feelings of loneliness and struggled with balancing his life as a Muslim with the temptations of the secular world around him. He wrote about his desire to attend university, possibly in the United States, and his thoughts on love and marriage. Officials have not confirmed that Internet postings by Farouk1986 were made by AbdulMutallab, but the many detailed biographical points made by the poster match what has been reported about AbdulMutallab's life. ""I will describe myself as very ambitious and determined, especially in the deen,"" Farouk1986 wrote in February 2005, referring to the Islamic way of life. The poster writes about being in boarding school, with possibilities of attending Stanford University or the University of California-Berkeley. Eventually, AbdulMutallab studied mechanical engineering at University College London. Besides being ambitious, Farouk1986 also described himself as lonely. ""First of all, I have no friend[s],"" he wrote in another online post with informal, imperfect grammar. ""Not because I do not socialise (sic), etc but because either people do not want to get too close to me as they go partying and stuff while I don't. or they are bad people who befriend me and influence me to do bad things. ""i have no one to speak too, no one to consult, no one to support me and i feel depressed and lonely. i do not know what to do."" Somewhere along the way, AbdulMutallab turned toward Islamic extremism. An FBI official said AbdulMutallab was included in the U.S. government's Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, after his father warned the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria of his son's hard-line beliefs and possible ties to militant Islamists. But his name was not pulled from that database and included on lists barring him from U.S.-bound aircraft. Part of the explosive device that failed to take down last week's flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, was sewn into AbdulMutallab's underwear, authorities said. A preliminary FBI analysis found the device contained pentaerythritol tetranitrate, an explosive also known as PETN. Investigators were having trouble determining what the accelerant AbdulMutallab allegedly tried to use to light the explosives because ""the syringe was pretty much destroyed,"" a law enforcement source told CNN. All 300 passengers and crew onboard the Christmas Day flight have been interviewed by authorities, the source said, adding that he expected no one else to be held or charged in connection with the incident. Farouk1986's online posts show that as early as 2005, he had a serious view of his religion. One of his struggles, the poster wrote, was that the ""loneliness leads me to other problems."" Farouk1986 said after fasting, ""I felt a shield that prevented evil thoughts coming into my head. I felt closer to Allah."" Being lonely awakened sexual desires that he struggled to control, he said, sometimes ""leading to minor sinful activities like not lowering the gaze."" His religion instructed him to fast to avoid such temptation, but it didn't seem to be working, Farouk1986 said. In another online post soon afterward, though, he took his comment back. CNN's Alden Mahler Levine and CNN Homeland Security Correspondent Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","Biographical details in posts by ""Farouk1986"" match reports of Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab's life .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Hurricane Gustav didn't pack the wallop of Katrina three years earlier, officials said Monday, but they urged almost 2 million evacuees to stay away from the Gulf Coast for another day. A man walks past a storefront that collapsed as Hurricane Gustav passed through Lafayette, Louisiana, on Monday. ""Tomorrow is not a day to start coming back to the city of New Orleans,"" Mayor Ray Nagin said Monday night. ""Power lines are down all over the city; there's a significant number of homes and businesses that are without power,"" Nagin said. Still, he said, Gustav didn't do the damage feared a few days ago, a possible repeat of 2005's Hurricane Katrina. ""I'd probably call Gustav, instead of the mother of all storms, maybe the mother-in-law or the ugly sister of all storms,"" Nagin said. Across Louisiana, more than 800,000 people were without electricity, and some may not see it restored for two weeks or more, Gov. Bobby Jindal said. At a news conference with Jindal, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff urged Gulf Coast residents who evacuated to stay away until damage could be assessed. But even those who fled faced hardships. About 2,700 people who took up short-term residence Monday in the Louisiana State University Agriculture Center in Alexandria were told that the buildings generator power was not reaching the plumbing system, meaning no showers and no flushing toilets, said John Barnett, head of the facilities. ""It's really crowded, and everybody's just trying to do their best,"" said Kesha Harlow, who was there with her daughter, 8, and her son, 2 months. ""We're just waiting for the storm to blow over."" Gustav roared from the Gulf of Mexico into southern Louisiana on Monday as a Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 110 mph, bringing fierce winds and heavy rains from the Alabama-Florida border west into Texas. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, two people were killed when a tree fell on the house where they were staying after they had come from farther south to escape the storm, officials said. A man was killed in a similar incident in north Lafayette, Louisiana, officials said. Four hospice patients died while waiting for air ambulances to evacuate them from southern Louisiana, according to Richard Zuschlag, chairman and CEO of Acadian Ambulance. Gustav was blamed for more than 60 deaths in the Caribbean, including 51 in southwestern Haiti. At 10 p.m. CT, Gustav was a tropical storm with sustained winds of 60 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. In New Orleans, Gustav drove sheets of water over the protective levees around the Industrial Canal early Monday afternoon, but the walls appeared to hold up under the onslaught as the winds faded. Up to 6 feet of water spilled into an industrial park in the Upper 9th Ward late Monday morning, pouring through small gaps in the concrete flood walls before receding in the afternoon.  Watch water spill over the levee Â» . But as the storm eased, inspectors from the Army Corps of Engineers and parish levee boards went out to check on the earthen walls and have found nothing to raise alarm, said Col. Craig Gunter, a Corps of Engineers spokesman. iReport.com: See one reader's footage of the levee . ""The levees all held up,"" Nagin said. ""I was hoping that this would happen, that we would be able to stand before America and before everyone and say we had some success with the levee system."" With the water level in Lake Pontchartrain north of the city rising, the Army Corps of Engineers closed flood gates on the 17th Street Canal and the London Avenue Canal, two areas that caused some of the more severe flooding during Katrina. Official feared late Monday afternoon that a private levee south of New Orleans was in danger of failing, but water levels receded, and sandbagging efforts appeared to have paid off. ""We have stopped the bleeding, and I am very encouraged by what we are seeing,"" Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said of the levee in Braithwaite. Gustav made landfall Monday morning near the coastal town of Cocodrie, Louisiana, about 80 miles southwest of New Orleans. iReport: Watch winds rip New Orleans rooftop . The storm's eastern bands, which generally pack the most powerful winds, also hammered Mississippi as Gustav moved to the west of New Orleans. In Biloxi, Mississippi, iReporter Kevin Wise, who lives two blocks from the beach, said Gustav had pushed the Gulf waters into a highway about 100 yards from the normal shoreline. ""On the beach, it was blowing hard enough that you had to squat down to take a picture; it could pretty much throw you around,"" he said. Wise said he and his wife ignored mandatory evacuation orders for his area. Almost 2 million residents evacuated the Louisiana coast, but some in New Orleans opted to brave the storm. ""It really didn't look as vicious as, obviously, Katrina did,"" Jack Bosma said.  Watch gales batter home, reporter Â» . He said the wind scattered his back gate across his yard, but his power was on, and neighbors had been congregating on his porch. ""It's really, quite honestly, basically, just like a bad storm. It doesn't seem that drastic at all,"" he said. iReport.com: Did you stay? Share your story . Property damage from Gustav could total $8 billion, just 25 percent of Sunday's estimate, according to a federally supported computer projection issued Monday morning.   See damage map Â» . Meanwhile, forecasters said late Monday that Hurricane Hanna was nearly stationary in the Bahamas. At 11 p.m. ET, Hanna had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, making it a Category 1 storm. Hanna could make landfall Friday near the Georgia/South Carolina border, possibly as a Category 2 storm with winds of 100 mph. And in the far eastern Atlantic, Tropical Storm Ike formed Monday with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. It was headed toward the Bahamas .

"(CNN) -- President Obama said Thursday that watching the arrival of 18 flag-draped cases containing bodies of Americans killed in Afghanistan was a ""sobering reminder"" of U.S. sacrifice as he prepares to decide on sending more troops there. At a brief media appearance with visiting Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, Obama was asked whether his unannounced appearance at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for the pre-dawn dignified transfer of the bodies would influence his decision on troop levels in Afghanistan. ""Obviously, it was a sobering reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices that our young men and women in uniform are engaging in every single day,"" the president said. Obama said the burden of war on U.S. troops and their families will ""bear on how I see these conflicts."" ""It is something I think about each and every day,"" he said. Also in attendance for the transfer of the bodies were Attorney General Eric Holder and Michele Leonhart, acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The bodies included three DEA special agents and 15 U.S. troops who died in Afghanistan this week. The agents were killed Monday as they returned from a raid on a compound believed to be harboring insurgents tied to drug trafficking. Seven U.S. troops also died when their helicopter went down in western Afghanistan. The military transport that landed in Delaware also included the bodies of eight U.S. soldiers killed Tuesday when their vehicles were hit by roadside bombs in two incidents in southern Afghanistan. The soldiers were from the 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team of the 2nd Infantry Division, based at Fort Lewis, Washington. The DEA identified the agents killed Monday as Forrest N. Leamon, 37, of Woodbridge, Virginia; Chad L. Michael, 30, of Quantico, Virginia; and Michael E. Weston, 37, of Washington. Leamon and Michael were members of the DEA's Foreign-deployed Advisory and Support Teams, and Weston was assigned to the agency's Kabul office.

"Vero Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Louis Schacht's family has been growing citrus in Vero Beach, Florida, for 60 years, contributing to a multibillion-dollar industry. But this year, he's worried. The winter weather blasting much of the country has made it to Florida, and the cold front now moving through is expected to last longer than usual. That could prove disastrous for Schacht and his fellow growers at the peak of the picking season. A chill can enhance the taste of the oranges and grapefruit that the Schacht family business grows and ships around the world. But if the temperature drops to 28 degrees Fahrenheit or below and stays there for four hours, fruit across Florida could be frozen and the crop destroyed. ""If it stays just above freezing, it can really help sweeten the fruit, but it's a fine line to walk. If it gets too cold, you can definitely have some damage,"" Schacht said. He has flooded his 280-acre grove in a bid to protect his fruit, as have larger growers across the state. ""What that does is create a little layer of warmth, usually about 20 to 25 feet from the surface, which is all we really need,"" Schacht said. And Schacht said that's just about all he can do. He said the fate of his fruit is now out of his hands. ""We've basically done what we can do,"" he said. ""You say a prayer and go to bed."" CNNMoney.com: Will prices rise for orange juice?

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities do not consistently offer the level of services and infrastructure necessary to properly treat the growing number of female veterans, a government investigation concludes. One official says the VA can offer women better medical care than they would get in private practice. The report by the Government Accountability Office found wide variation in the medical centers' facilities and programs for female veterans. Investigators visited 18 veterans' facilities and found that basic services, like pelvic examinations, were being provided and that patients had access to female providers for gender-specific care. But the facilities were lacking in some simpler accommodations, such as the configuration of exam rooms and privacy in check-in areas. The department says it is taking comprehensive steps to improve, including programs for primary care and mental health care for female veterans, along with having a female veterans' program manager in each of its medical facilities. But Veterans Affairs faces hurdles in its efforts to improve its services and facilities, the department's chief consultant for women's medical care testified before Congress on Tuesday. ""Moving to a more comprehensive primary care delivery model could challenge VA clinicians, who may have dealt predominantly with male veterans and sometimes have little or no exposure to female patients,"" said Patricia Hayes of the department's Women's Veterans Health Strategic Healthcare Group. Only one-third of veterans' facilities offer a separate space for women to receive gynecological, mental health and social work services, according to Hayes. There is a goal to have a gynecologist available at every facility by 2012, she said. And Dennis Cullinan, national legislative director for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, noted that Veterans Affairs has contracted out to provide female veterans care in the facilities where there are not in-house providers. He said the department is fighting an aging infrastructure that is making it tougher to improve facilities. ""The facilities to provide the level of care and privacy just aren't there,"" he said. ""The VA is pursuing this. They are absolutely not dodging it."" There are more than 1.8 million female veterans in the United States, 8 percent of the veteran population. In 2008, more than 281,000 female veterans received care from Veterans Affairs, according to the department's statistics. The number of female veterans enrolled for medical care with the department is expected to increase by 30 percent in the next five years, it predicts. The median age of female veterans is much lower than their male counterparts: 47, compared with 61, according to Veterans Affairs data. Hayes said the department can offer female veterans better care than they would receive in private practices. ""Women are screened for unique health concerns like cervical cancer or breast cancer at higher rates than non-VA health care programs,"" she noted. While noting that the department has taken steps to upgrade its services and facilities to meet the needs of female veterans, investigators found that it stumbled on some more basic elements. None of the facilities visited was fully compliant with the department's standards for privacy, investigators found, including privacy in the check-in area. ""In most clinical settings, check-in desk or windows were located in a mixed-gender waiting room or on a high-traffic public corridor,"" the report explained. In a majority of the clinics, ""check-in desk were located in close proximity to chairs where other patients waited for their appointment."" In one facility, it said, investigators observed other patients lining up immediately behind the patient trying to check in. The government investigators also found that exam tables were not oriented away from the door or shielded properly by curtains, as is required, and there was a lack of toilets near the facilities where gynecological examinations were conducted. And only two of the facilities provided sanitary napkin dispensers in at least one public restroom for women.","GAO report finds centers lacking in simple accommodations .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Joan Baez is in a celebratory mood. And rightly so: She's survived 50 years in show business. Joan Baez says that her new Steve Earle-produced album was meant to sound like a throwback to the folk era. The legendary singer, who rose to fame during the folk movement of the 1950s and 1960s, is marking the occasion with a new album called ""Day After Tomorrow."" Produced by Steve Earle (whom Baez likes to call ""Mister Gruff""), it's a collection of bluegrass-tinged songs reminiscent of her early repertoire. ""We were looking for songs that feel like now but sound like back then,"" she said. Earle penned one of the album's standout tracks, ""God Is God,"" which he describes as ""recovery speak."" Baez also covers ""Scarlet Tide,"" a song written by Elvis Costello and T Bone Burnett for the 2003 film ""Cold Mountain."" At 67, Baez finds her voice may not have the sheer power it did in her 20s, but her political spirit is intact. She passionately expressed her support for Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the first time the self-described pacifist has taken sides in party politics. ""I haven't heard an orator like that since King,"" she said. Baez knew the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and famously sang the protest song ""We Shall Overcome"" to a massive crowd at the Lincoln Memorial during King's 1963 March on Washington. Baez spoke to CNN about sustaining her voice and finding happiness in her 60s. The following is an edited version of that interview, which was conducted before Tuesday's election. CNN: What did Steve Earle bring to the table with your new album? Joan Baez: Oh, everything but the voice. Spirit, some songs. His gruffness to my non-gruffness. He worked fast, really fast, and I like that. And he brought the musicians. I don't know who to choose for musicians. We were a good match. CNN: Is there a song on the album that speaks to you more than others? Baez: I guess the ones I go back listening to are ""God Is God"" and ""Rose of Sharon."" ""Rose of Sharon"" sounds exactly like an old folk song. I wouldn't have guessed in a million years that it's contemporary. CNN: How does it feel to be embarking on a new tour at such a politically charged time? Baez: I've never seen this country this politically charged. I realized something this morning. I was watching Obama on TV and I thought, ""I really love this guy."" I love what he's capable of, I love that he's genuine. He's a statesman, and he's brilliant. People say do you think he can change America? He already has. ... And I know most of the things he'll have to do I would battle him to the death. He's going to be commander in chief of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and I'm a pacifist [laughs]. CNN: So you would almost prefer that he didn't run for president, that his talents could be applied in other ways? Baez: Yeah. I've thought that, yeah. Part of me wishes very strongly that Obama would be outside the system and his hands would be less tied. CNN: In the '50s and '60s, you lived and breathed the causes you rallied behind.  When you look at young musicians today, do you feel they're attaching themselves to charities or causes because it's hip, rather than meaningful? Baez: I think it's probably a combination of things. I think people are afraid of risk so they'll [only] go so far. But I don't think people have felt the urgency that we felt in the '60s. But it's there. The urgency is there. There's a need for community, but we don't feel it. CNN: Why is that? Baez: That we don't feel it? Because we live more and more separately. Kids are walking down the street plugged in [to personal electronics]. The only place there's community really is in the ghetto, where they need each other and they know it. We need each other, and we don't know it. CNN: You look back at all the causes you've rallied behind, and there have been so many. ... Baez: It makes me dizzy. CNN: [Do] you feel emotionally wrung out? Baez: No. It's the opposite. What happens is it starts generating energy for myself. There's some part of me that's wiped out. I feel that sometimes. CNN: Do you find you have to work harder to keep your voice in shape? Baez: Oh God, yeah. It was very humiliating to find out that I was like everybody else in the world and that I had to get coaching. And now it's a real issue. I have to do [vocal exercises] every day, especially on tour. It's pretty exhausting. CNN: Would you say that life in your 60s is easier than life in your 20s and 30s? Baez: Oh God, yes. ... I was a highly neurotic kid, not particularly happy, which probably accounts for all those beautiful songs, those beautiful sad ballads. I found my home there. And as the years went by and as the therapy went on I was holding together. And then at around 50, I decided to fall apart and find the pieces and put them back where they should've been. And I did. And I did what I thought was impossible, which was really drag the stuff up, look at it, go through all that and then each time I did that ... it became a daily thing with the therapist ... to find out something huge. Go through the terror, go through all of it and then by the end of the week something had changed a little bit. This went on for a number of years. So I am now in a stage nothing like where I was before then. There's no stage fright now. Just the joy of singing. CNN: You're happy being single, aren't you? Baez: Yeah. After all I've been through, I don't want to risk [pats her heart]. I mean I feel so extraordinary, so much better. And you know if something walked into my life that feels right ... the question is, am I ready to see it or not? I'm sure it's wandered by me a few times. But at some point maybe I'll be ready to see that in which case it would be a good thing. ... [In] Buddhism there's no real happiness without the struggle. But the struggle has to defeat you in a way [before] you get to be like the Dalai Lama. You know those monks all giggle? All the time! They've got it figured out. Because things are what they are on Earth, and you be as good as you can, and you die, it's the next life. So what's the big f****** deal?","Joan Baez has new album, ""Day After Tomorrow,"" produced by Steve Earle .

"AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Garry Mauro will never forget that night in 1972 when he says Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham ignored the post-election party surrounding them, instead preferring to huddle in a corner and talk about changing the future. Hillary and Bill Clinton worked on George McGovern's 1972 campaign in Texas before they wed in 1975. The young then-unmarried couple, attending Yale Law, weren't interested in letting off steam with their Democratic colleagues in Austin, Texas, according to Mauro, who's now a strategist with Sen. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The three were among a group of Young Turk Democrats working that summer to register voters in Texas. The Clintons had just started dating, said Mauro, who years later became Texas land commissioner. ""They obviously had a lot of respect for each other, and they would spend hours talking to each other."" More than 35 years on, Hillary Clinton has returned to Texas -- running a hard-fought campaign of her own and telling voters about her days there in the '70s. Mauro recalls the night it was all over in 1972, after Democrat George McGovern lost to Republican Richard Nixon. He says he and the Clintons decided to let loose in lively Austin, paying $1.50 to see a Texas singer by the name of Willie Nelson before rambling back to a colleague's tiny apartment. ""It was 2 o'clock in the morning, and everybody else had probably had too much to drink, except for Bill and Hillary -- who were drinking [soda] and having this intense discussion about the issues,"" said Mauro. ""I'm absolutely certain that 99 percent of what they were talking about was changing things in the future."" Mauro's story underscores how Sen. Clinton's lifelong political journey has come full circle in Texas. With the March 4 primary just days away, the place where the New York senator got her first job in presidential politics may become her launching pad to the White House -- or perhaps one of her final battlegrounds. Clinton and her Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama have been dueling in the state for weeks, as polls show the candidates locked in a razor-thin race to win the biggest share of 193 Texas delegates, who are crucial to sewing up the party nomination. Another key state, Ohio, also holds its primary March 4 to allocate 141 delegates. Former officials from Clinton's husband's administration have openly discussed the challenges Clinton faces from Obama, who has defeated the New York senator in the past 11 contests. Exit polls after previous primaries show Obama is cutting into Clinton's base by gaining support among blue-collar workers and Latino voters. Former White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers called Texas a ""do-or-die test."" President Clinton's former strategist James Carville said if the New York senator fails to win Ohio or Texas, ""This thing is done."" And the former president himself said if voters in Texas don't deliver, ""I don't think she can be"" the party's nominee. Mauro underscored the historic importance of the '08 election. ""We couldn't have conceived of a woman running for president in 1972,"" said Mauro. ""It never would have occurred to people that you'd have a presidential race between a woman and an African-American."" Obama leads Clinton in the crucial delegate count -- 1,369 to 1,267, according to CNN calculations. The count includes superdelegates who have publicly declared their support for one of the candidates. Superdelegates consist of elected and party officials who are allowed to vote at the Democratic National Convention. They are free to vote for any candidate and are not bound by primary or caucus results. To win the nomination, 2,025 national convention delegates are needed. Neither candidate is expected to garner enough delegates in the remaining primaries and caucuses to take the nomination outright, and the roughly 800 superdelegates are likely to be the deciding factor. Mauro and the Clintons cut their political teeth in Texas during the 1972 election, knocking on doors and registering people -- many of them minorities -- to vote. Texas election workers often looked with suspicion at the so-called ""out-of-staters."" ""Most of them had a funny accent and really didn't know how to talk to people,"" Mauro said. ""That was not the case with Hillary Clinton. She always established a rapport with the local officials she was working with -- even the ones that started out being aggressively negative. And she would always seem to move the ball forward."" Like other places in the South at the time, Texas still had pockets of racial segregation, Mauro said, and it reminded them how much work needed to be done. ""Sometimes we forget how far we've come. In this city there were still bathrooms and water fountains that were segregated. There were lots of places African-Americans and Hispanics were not welcome and were not allowed."" When the Clintons, Mauro and their colleagues needed to let off steam in Austin, the town's traditional watering holes filled the bill, places such as Armadillo Headquarters and the century-old Scholz Garten -- a German beer garden with an outdoor patio set under spreading oaks.  See photos of Clinton through the years Â» . ""Clinton acquitted!"" screams a framed 1999 headline from The Washington Post on the wall at Scholz. Other items adorning the walls feature former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Lyndon Johnson.  Watch storied nightspot where Clintons hung out Â» . When Bill Clinton returned to Texas for his own presidential run, they frequented Guero's Taco Bar in Austin's funky South Congress Avenue neighborhood, which trendsetters like to call SoCo. The friendships and alliances Sen. Clinton made during those days sowed the seeds of a statewide grassroots network of supporters that she's counting on to win in 2008. ""We're going to use those spurs to help her get elected,"" said Mauro. In general, said Mauro, a national election campaign is grueling. ""Most people only have a few good elections in them,"" said Mauro. ""It's really hard work. It's grunt work."" For that reason, he said, ""That's a pretty remarkable person to keep that enthusiasm and drive and continue to have that grit 30 years later.""

"(CNN) -- The bodies of three students at a North Dakota university who had been missing since Sunday were found Tuesday in a vehicle submerged in a pond near their school, police said. The discovery came Tuesday afternoon after a search team found tire tracks leading to a stock pond for cattle five miles northwest of Dickinson, North Dakota, Lt. William Leach of the Stark County Sheriff's Office told CNN. The investigators found a white 1997 Jeep Cherokee with California tags containing the bodies, he said. Foul play is not suspected, he said. The Dickinson State University softball players -- Kyrstin Gemar, 22, a senior who owned the car; Afton Williamson, 20, a junior; and Ashley Neufeld, 21, a senior -- had last been reported seen about 10:45 p.m. Sunday, according to CNN affiliate KXMB. At 11:18 p.m. and 11:19 p.m., teammates received two distress calls from the women during which they mentioned water and a lake, said Connie Walter, Dickinson director of university relations. After the calls ended abruptly, the teammates contacted law enforcement and the search began. At 12:07 a.m. Monday, a ""ping"" on a tower from one of the students' cell phones was traced to a cell tower five miles northeast of Dickinson and authorities concentrated their search in that area, officials said. Watch the women's coach recall ""awesome person"" Authorities have not identified the owner of the pond, which is 25 yards by 25 yards in area. It was not known how the students ended up in the stock pond, which is on private property and is part of a farm and cattle operation, Walter said. Dickinson Police Officer Thomas Grosz told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that authorities believed the women may have gone out to a lake to stargaze. That would not have been unusual, Gemar's father, Lenny, told ABC. Dickinson, he said, is a ""pretty small town"" without an active nightlife. He said the women routinely drove to a lake to stargaze and chat. Williamson and Gemar were from California, while Neufeld was from Canada, according to KXMB. Dickinson is almost 100 miles west of Bismarck, North Dakota.","Police find women in car submerged in pond .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Pacific island nation of Palau has agreed to take in 17 Chinese Muslims held at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the country's ambassador to the United States said Wednesday. The map shows the Pacific island nation of Palau in relation to China. Details of the transfer are still being worked out, Ambassador Hersey Kyota told CNN. But Kyota said his country, a former U.S. Pacific trust territory, has agreed to take in the ethnic Uighur detainees ""for humanitarian reasons"" and because of the ""special relationship"" between Palau and the United States. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly would not comment on the announcement, telling reporters, ""We're still involved in ongoing discussions."" The agreement includes some U.S. aid for Palau, Kyota said, but he said those details remained to be worked out as well. The country, with a population of about 20,000, is about 1,000 miles southeast of Manila, Philippines, and about 4,600 miles west of Hawaii. Palau has received nearly $900 million in U.S. aid since independence in 1994, according to congressional auditors, and depends on Washington for defense. The ""Compact of Free Association"" between Palau and the United States is up for review, but Kelly said any additional aid offer ""is not linked to any other discussions we may be having with the government of Palau."" The Uighurs were accused of receiving weapons and military training in Afghanistan. Some of the prisoners have been cleared for release from the Guantanamo Bay facility since 2003, but the United States would not send them back to China out of concern that Chinese authorities would torture them. A federal court ordered the men released, but an appeals court halted that order. China has said no returned Uighurs would be tortured, but it has warned other countries against taking the men. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jiang Yu told reporters in February that the men ""must be handed over to China and brought to justice.""","Country's ambassador to U.S. says agreement includes some aid to Palau .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two Washington Wizards basketball players drew guns on each other during a heated Christmas Eve gambling debt dispute, the New York Post reported Friday. Law enforcement authorities said they were investigating an incident but gave no details. Wizards teammates Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton both brandished firearms in the team's locker room, the Post reported, citing NBA league sources. The dispute erupted when Arenas, a three-time NBA all-star, refused to pay up on a debt owed to Crittenton, the Post stated, citing an anonymous league source. Multiple sources said Arenas drew his gun first, the Post reported. Arenas denied the charge, saying he never pulled a weapon. Neither Arenas, 27, nor Crittenton, 22, could be reached for comment Friday. The incident, according to the Post, occurred during a Wizards practice day at the Verizon Center, the team's arena in downtown Washington. It is unclear whether any other Wizards players witnessed the alleged confrontation, the Post said. NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Friday that there is ""an active investigation"" being conducted by Washington law enforcement authorities. ""We are not taking any independent action at this time,"" he said. The Wizards also released a statement Friday saying that the team takes ""this situation and the ongoing investigation very seriously. We are continuing to cooperate fully with the proper authorities and the NBA."" A Washington Metropolitan Police Department statement earlier in the week said local law enforcement was assisting the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia ""with an investigation into an allegation that weapons were located inside a locker room at the Verizon Center.""

"(CNN) -- The attack on a Danish political cartoonist ""runs totally against the teachings and values of Islam,"" the umbrella organization representing Muslim countries has said. If the attack was a reaction to Kurt Westergaard's drawing of the Muslim prophet Mohammed with a turban shaped as a bomb, ""then it should be rejected and condemned by all Muslims,"" the Organization of the Islamic Conference said in a statement Sunday. An ax-wielding Somali man is accused of trying to break into Westergaard's home Friday and was charged the next day with attempted assassination. Intelligence officials linked the suspect to an East African Islamist militia allied with al Qaeda. The suspect tried to kill Westergaard and an on-duty police officer, the Danish Intelligence and Security Service said. Danish police shot the 28-year-old suspect Friday night as he tried to enter Westergaard's home in the city of Aarhus. The suspect was shot in the right leg and left hand. He was hospitalized after the incident. Video showed him appearing at court strapped to a stretcher. Authorities did not identify him because the judge decided it would be illegal to disclose his name, said Chief Superintendent Ole Madsen with the East Jutland Police. They said he has legal residency in Denmark and lives in Sjaelland, near Copenhagen. The judge ordered the suspect held for four weeks while the investigation proceeds. Madsen said the man is currently the only suspect in the case, and he would not say whether police were investigating anyone else. Al-Shabaab, the militant organization with alleged ties to the suspect, is waging a bloody battle against Somalia's transitional government and is currently on a U.S. government list of terrorist organizations. At a news conference in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said, ""We are very happy with the Somali national who attacked the house of the Danish cartoonist who previously insulted our prophet Mohammed. This is an honor for the Somali people. We are telling that we are glad that anyone who insults Islam should be attacked wherever they are."" Police had no indication that an attack was being planned on Westergaard, Madsen said, though the intelligence service said the suspect had been under surveillance because of his alleged terrorist links. Police said the suspect wielded an ax and a knife and managed to crack the glass front door of Westergaard's home. A home alarm alerted police to the scene, and they were attacked by the suspect, authorities said. Westergaard, who was home with his 5-year-old granddaughter at the time of the break-in, hid in a ""panic room"" when he realized what was happening, Madsen said. Westergaard is ordinarily accompanied by bodyguards when he leaves his home, but nobody was on guard at the house Friday, the Security and Intelligence Service told CNN. Police said Westergaard was ""being taken care of"" after the break-in, but wouldn't reveal his new location. The incident ""once again confirms the terrorist threat that is directed against Denmark and against cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, in particular,"" said Jakob Scharf, spokesman for the Danish Security and Intelligence Service. Westergaard's caricature of Mohammed -- showing the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse -- was first published by the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten in September 2005. It sparked an uproar among Muslims in early 2006 after newspapers reprinted the images in support of free speech. At the time, Westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terrorism. However, many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist. Over the years, Danish authorities have arrested other suspects who allegedly plotted against Westergaard's life. After three such arrests in February 2008, Westergaard issued a statement, saying, ""Of course I fear for my life after the Danish Security and Intelligence Service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me. However, I have turned fear into anger and indignation. It has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which I used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness."" Scharf said authorities have taken measures to ensure Westergaard's safety, and that the protection has ""proven effective."" -- CNN's Per Nyberg and reporter Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.","Organization of the Islamic Conference condemns attack on cartoonist .

"London, England (CNN) --  YouTube this week announced the biggest viral video sensations of 2009, with Scottish singer Susan Boyle topping the list. The most pressing question for aspiring video creators: How do you repeat that kind of success? Value in views . Topping the YouTube charts brings significant value -- Boyle's clip had more than 120 million views on the site. Had the parties involved negotiated an ad revenue split (they initially did not), a not-inconceivable $10 cost-per-thousand-impressions would have yielded revenue in excess of $1 million. When a clip has a commercial purpose, the brand value may be significantly higher: Evian's Roller Babies ad ranked fifth, with more than 27 million views, and the company says the campaign's success slowed its sales decline. A commercial impact was also felt in the case of the JK Wedding Entrance Dance (more than 33 million views). The clip, which features a wedding party dancing down the aisle to Chris Brown's ""Forever,"" sent the track rocketing up the iTunes charts. What are the commonalities here, and is there a formula for viral video success? A definitive answer is infuriatingly absent. The cute factor . The cute factor is perhaps the most prevalent trend among popular YouTube videos. In YouTube's most-viewed videos of all time, you'll find such adorable clips as a boy biting his brother's finger (140 million views), a baby laughing hysterically (100 million views), a sneezing panda (46 million views) and even the Evian ad. The explanation is simple: When a clip makes us happy, we feel compelled to share that sentiment with others. Humor . If our willingness to share is based on our emotional reaction to a clip, it follows that humor ranks highly on YouTube. From Jeff Dunham's ventriloquist act ""Achmed the Dead Terrorist"" to the obscure humor of ""Charlie The Unicorn,"" laughter is a common theme. In some cases, humor is not the intent: Tay Zonday's Chocolate Rain has surpassed 45 million views, our amusement (and discomfort) deriving from Zonday's utterly bizarre performance. Comedy has geographical limitations however: What's funny in one country may be unfathomable in another. This perhaps explains why laughing babies consistently outrank standup comedians: funny doesn't travel. Emotional response . Not every popular clip evokes laughter -- performances from Susan Boyle and Paul Potts tug at the heartstrings. So too does the Free Hugs campaign --  a music video featuring an Australian man giving out ""Free Hugs"" to strangers in public places has received more than 53 million views. Music . Music videos are by far the most viewed content on YouTube. Had YouTube not created a second list to highlight top music videos on the site, these would have dominated the rankings for 2009. The knowledge that best-selling artists rank highly on video sites may be of little utility to aspiring YouTube stars -- except to note that dancing videos and ""lip dubs"" have proved popular. With 132 million views, Judson Laipply's Evolution of Dance is a breakout success. Cumulative advantage . Is the quality of the clip the only factor affecting its success? Or could it be that the rich get richer, even in the seemingly egalitarian world of YouTube? Since most YouTube users head straight to the site's ""Popular"" page, clips that show early promise may continue to gain momentum for weeks and years. This process of cumulative advantage may help to explain why one laughing baby shoots to the top of the charts and another giggles in obscurity. No formula? It may be the case that there's no simple formula for YouTube popularity. In fact, it may be that the only true guarantee of success is novelty. The unexpected, the bizarre, the humorous, the offbeat, the emotionally affecting -- these authentic elements are hard to bottle, and fakes are easy to spot. What will be YouTube's breakout video of 2010? We'll know it when we see it.","Mashable's Pete Cashmore ponders what makes a YouTube video a viral smash .

"(CNN) -- In an effort to alleviate problems facing the company, Starbucks announced that it will close 600 company-run U.S. stores over the next year. Most of the stores are near another Starbucks and aren't profitable. Nancy Blomquist moved from Georgia to Arizona and sent friends this photo of her first 'houseguest' -- Starbucks. CNN.com asked iReporters to respond to the news that the coffee giant, known for its saturation of the market, is shuttering some retail locations. iReporter mattwilliams says he's happy to see some Starbucks go, opening the market for independent coffee shops. Rusty1978 says he can't imagine how Starbucks is in financial trouble, given that his local store is always packed. Cval predicts more people will give up their lattes as the economy tightens. Below are a selection of iReport responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Starbucks here . Stefan: Starbucks Coffee, no doubt, has been a powerhouse phenomenon in the American barista world. The coffee super-giant has not only introduced, but set a national trend in coffee drinking for years to come ... they have created a culture. Everywhere you look, from street corners, to bookstores and now even supermarkets, there is a Starbucks coffee shop or stand. So what will we do if we no longer have our daily dose of super-charged joe? Go somewhere else. Since they started becoming a national chain, there has been a rush of smaller coffee shops trying to duplicate the relaxing, welcoming feel of Starbucks, and some do well and even exceed the patron's expectations, offering sofa's, tables, background music and even free internet. But what about the coffee? As for those specialty drinks, many small coffee shop owners have started sending their employees to barista school, where they learn how to make the ""perfect"" cup of coffee / espresso with those perfect little beans. ... It is possible we may see a new coffee shop in town; and maybe, just maybe, the ""next big thing"". FlashBauer38: I am glad to see Starbucks finally realized you only need one store per city block. I personally do not like or go to Starbucks. I normally get my coffee from Dunkin Donuts on the way to work or buy grounds from them to make at home ... for a reasonable price. I already have to spend $4 a gallon on gas, why would I spend $4 for 12 oz of coffee? cval: You're kidding me, right? Anyone heard of the Mr. Coffee machine? You can get one for $15, and set it to have your coffee ready for you when you roll out of bed, then it turns off an hour later so as not to burn your house down should you forget to turn it off. Starbucks has always been a luxury item, when people need to get back to basics to survive. Maybe people are just realizing this, and it is way overdue if you ask me. It's as expensive as smoking, think of all the money you can put into savings if you brew your own coffee. Johnmcook: ""My Starbucks"", in the Uptown section of West Village is much more than a place to get a cup of java. It is a real part of the community, a busy, urban, somewhat trendy area near downtown Dallas. I know each employee by name and they know me. I keep track of their progress through college, another's budding music career, and will attend another's wedding. When on the patio with my Chihuahua, they bring him water to help beat the heat or whipped cream as a treat ... If you have ever spent time in the UK... you understand the social importance of meeting at the local pub... my Starbucks is the equivalent of that. You come there to get your favorite coffee but you leave with and come back for ... so much more. rusty1978: Well, amongst all the Starbucks frowners around, I must say it's strong coffee and that's how I like it. I've got a Starbucks in commercial space in my building -- so convenient. I love the Verona, Gold Coast and Kenya blends. I just can't believe they're not doing good business as most every store is always packed with people -- and they've even raised their prices last year, so I can't understand the closings at all. Someone please explain. Yes, I prefer strong Starbucks coffee in the morning! mattwilliams: Could I live without Starbucks? The answer is a resounding YES! I live in a small tourist town on the coast of Georgia. Our many different local restaurants provide unique dining experiences with their atmospheres and menus. This is something I fear is being lost because of big chains like Starbucks coming in and replacing local, unique businesses with the same atmosphere and dining experience one could have in Anytown, USA. So rather than make every little getaway town in this country the very same one Starbucks at a time, I say boycott them all and shut them all down! That won't happen because Starbucks has become part of a routine for so many people. What would be nice is for the average American consumer to wake up and try to have a unique experience in his or her hometown. Rather than going to that same Starbucks that is so convenient with its drive-thru and perfect location on the way to one's destination, why not take a detour and find a mom-and-pop coffee shoppe, like our own Palm Coast Coffee or Daddy Cate's, and support their brave attempt at making the landscape of where one lives unique. Nblomq: Definitely a Starbucks Junkie! I moved from Georgia to Arizona last fall, and the first digital picture I sent my girlfriends once I arrived in Tucson was a picture of my first official visitor to my new home ... a Starbucks Chai! grdpxjmpr: I absolutely could live without Starbucks. Reason 1: I don't like the taste of Starbucks coffee, especially since they had their closure back in February to make their coffee shop more like a coffee shop. The coffee they have started using since then is terrible. 2. If the Starbucks chain would close some stores, it would allow mom-and-pop-type places to get a footing in the market or allow local smaller chains to expand. 3. Buying beans for home and making your own coffee is substantially less expensive than getting coffee every day from Starbucks. In this economy, being able to pinch pennies helps. MrRealtor: I hate to say this, but I just like a good ole cup of coffee, and that cannot be found at a Starbucks. Even their most mild coffee is terribly bitter. Will I miss them? No. I would miss a 99-cent cup of coffee from 7-11 worse than a $4.50 cup of yuck from Starbucks. Blueken: In my entire life, I have had exactly one coffee from Starbucks. Nothing special. I'm not a coffee snob, of course, but I do like a pure Kona roast. I get my caffeine fix at the local gas station. Fresh brewed, $1.49. I predict overpriced microbrew beer is the next to take a hit as the economy gets real. IchDenke: Yep, Starbucks is too pricey, too burnt and too mega for me! Gimme a hometown-y joint that ain't too expensive and supports our veterans like Just Plain Joe's, and I'm OK! :)","The Starbucks coffee chain announced Tuesday it will shutter 600 stores .

"She told stories, flirted outrageously with boys and was constantly changing her hairstyle. Anne Frank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office in Amsterdam. It could be the description of almost any young girl growing up in Europe. But this is how Eva Schloss remembers her childhood friend Anne Frank, who had she not died in a Nazi concentration camp, would have celebrated her 80th birthday this week. Schloss described Frank, whose account of hiding from Jewish persecution in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam is one of the world's mostly widely-read books, as a spunky young schoolgirl with a passion for storytelling that often got her into trouble. ""She got her diary in 1942, so obviously her father knew she was interested in writing and I know she told stories,"" said Schloss. ""She talked a lot and she was called Mrs Quack Quack. Very often she used to write hundreds of lines [at school] of 'I'm not going to talk so much,' and so on -- but obviously she had a lot to tell."" In some ways the two friends lived parallel lives -- but tragically they had very different outcomes.  Watch more about Schloss' story Â» . Schloss and Frank both came from Jewish families who fled to Holland to escape the wave of anti-Semitism spreading across Europe as the Nazis rose to power in Germany ahead of the Second World War. But while Schloss was more of an introvert, Frank loved the limelight. Schloss said: ""I was actually quite shy and she was the center of attention. We had steps where we sat, and she had a crowd of children around her. ""She was a big flirt -- she loved boys. She was always showing us who was her boyfriend at that particular time. She was always interested in her clothes. Her style, she always changed it. Sometimes she had curls, then she had straight hair."" Schloss says they were unaware of the full scale of what was going on around them as war escalated across Europe, placing their lives in increasing jeopardy. ""Our parents really protected us so there was no talk about the horrendous things which happened. ""You couldn't go out anymore after 8 o'clock, but for a 11 to 12 year old it didn't matter so much. Or not going to the cinema -- we were upset about those little things which we couldn't do, but we really didn't really take it seriously at that time."" Like Frank, Schloss was also forced into hiding when the Nazis took control of Holland. Frank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office. But Schloss and her family had to split up. Schloss stayed with her mother while her father and brother hid elsewhere. She and her mother moved around, staying in seven different hiding places over a two-year period. Eventually both families were betrayed and were sent to concentration camps, where Frank died at the age of 15. Schloss said: ""My father and brother were betrayed by a Dutch nurse who was a double agent, and all four of us were arrested and taken to the headquarters to be interrogated. ""I didn't know anything, which was a good thing. So eventually they realized this and they gave up torturing me. Within two days we were put on a transport to Auschwitz."" Of her family, only Schloss and her mother survived Auschwitz, one of the most notorious concentration camps, located in southern Poland. Today Schloss, who has just celebrated her own 80th birthday, has a husband, three daughters and five grandchildren. Schloss says it took her decades to rebuild her life, with the help of Frank's father Otto, who also survived incarceration in a concentration camp. She met Otto in August 1945, when he showed her Frank's diary. Schloss said: ""He read a few passages but he always burst into tears. It took me 20 years. I was really unhappy, but it was Otto who came to our apartment to talk to us, and he helped me a lot. He had lost everybody. ""Her book, she [Frank] made people aware of what happened. There are many messages. She believed in the goodness of mankind. ""People always ask me, what she would have done. I guess we will never know. But I guess she would have gone into politics -- she was a fighter. It's a pity, but also -- maybe her diary would have never been published."" CNN's Don Riddell contributed to this story.","Anne Frank would have celebrated her 80th birthday this week .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Flannery O'Connor did not expect to become the subject of a biography. She thought the narrow borders of her life -- lived ""between the house and the chicken yard"" -- wouldn't give a writer much to work with. Author Flannery O'Connor (here with two of her peacocks) remains a subject of fascination for many. It would therefore come as a surprise (and probably secretly please her) to learn she is the focus of at least three. The latest is ""Flannery: A Life of Flannery O'Connor"" (Little, Brown) by Brad Gooch, an exhaustively researched exploration of O'Connor's unlikely journey from shy, sarcastic and ""contrary"" Georgia girl to acerbic literary treasure. That she suffered from lupus and died before the age of 40 is well-known to fans of O'Connor. But Gooch uncovers much that even ardent followers of the author will find revealing, including details of her college career as a cartoonist, and her time in Iowa City at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The book manages to synthesize what seems difficult to reconcile: how such a chaste, religious person could produce stories that are bitingly funny and filled with shocking violence.  Watch O'Connor's fascinating story Â» . Gooch spoke with CNN about his experience researching the biography. What follows is an edited version of the interview.

And I'd had a few hunches about her from reading the stories, which were a little mysterious. ... And then when I read the letters, a lot of those hunches seemed true. ... Trying to put the life of this woman together with the stories became as interesting as the stories to me. CNN: She wasn't always known as Flannery O'Connor. Gooch: Her name was Mary Flannery O'Connor, and her mother and everyone in Milledgeville (Georgia), where she lived most of her life, continued to call her Mary Flannery. But when she went to Iowa City -- the Iowa Writers' Workshop -- early on, she decided she wanted to be a writer, and she decided on the name Flannery. She later said, ""Who would want to buy these stories of an Irish washerwoman named Mary O'Connor?"" Partly, I think she wanted to lose the Southern-ness of ""Mary Flannery."" ...  Also, Flannery was a gender-neutral name. ... Her initial rejection letters were actually addressed to ""Mr. Flannery O'Connor,"" and I think she kind of liked that neutrality. CNN: What did you find most remarkable about her? Gooch: I think the discipline of her writing becomes ... almost inspiring. She developed lupus when she was 25, she lived until she was 39. And in that period, she kept up this regimen that she had begun at the Iowa Writers' Workshop of writing every morning for three hours, even if it meant sitting in front of a blank page. ... [Near the end of her life] she was editing her final stories and hiding them under the pillow in the hospital from the doctors so that she could go on. She was still working on her last story after she had last rites. ... All of that is a sort of [a] level of commitment that is startling and unmatched. CNN: Her stories are often funny, yet disturbing. Gooch: Her style goes under these names, like grotesque or gothic, but she was really crossing these two wires of humor and almost this kind of dark theological writing that had never been put together before. ... [In ""A Good Man is Hard to Find""] a family on vacation ... meets someone named the Misfit, this ex-con in the woods. ... And he winds up shooting the entire family while spouting existentialist, nihilist philosophy. And in that story, there's always a point where you keep laughing past this line, and suddenly someone's being shot and you're laughing and then [readers] get very uncomfortable. They can't tell whether this is supposed to be funny or not, and I think that O'Connor definitely works in that territory, where you can't tell if she's being funny or tragic and serious. CNN: The titles of her stories and novels are so wonderful -- ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find,"" ""Everything That Rises Must Converge,"" ""The Life You Save May Be Your Own,"" ""The Violent Bear It Away."" Gooch: ""A Good Man is Hard to Find"" was a Bessie Smith song; ""Everything That Rises Must Converge"" she got from Teilhard de Chardin, a favorite Catholic theologian of hers. You see in a way how sophisticated she was in her approach to her writing. I think sometimes when people read the stories, they confuse O'Connor with the character in her story, and they think she is some Grandma-Moses-crazy-folk-artist, but actually she was an incredibly educated artist who had read everything, including a lot of theology. ... The titles ... are attracting and punchy, but you also see that she's working kind of consciously with these reverberating references. CNN: What do you make of her fascination with birds? Gooch: When she was forced by lupus to move back to the South and live on a dairy farm with her mother in Georgia, one of the first things she did besides getting very serious about working on her stories was to order a peacock. And eventually she had 39 peacocks. ... And I think that she was very conscious that the peacock was this gawky, comic bird. I think she identified with the peacock for that reason. The peacock squawked all night and annoyed people, ate her mother's flowers, and yet, at this certain willful moment, opened its tail and revealed what she called this ""map of the universe."" So, I think it really stood in a way for this kind of transfiguration that would take place for her spiritually but also in the beauty of her writing. ... She definitely made an effort to make the peacock her own personal logo. CNN: What is her literary reputation 45 years after her death? Gooch: She seems to be ever more popular. When she died she was considered almost a minor writer. Her second volume of stories hadn't even come out; her ""Collected Stories"" was published in the early 1970s and got a posthumous National Book Award. It seems that every decade, interest in her grows. When the Library of America put out her collected works 10 years ago, she outsold Faulkner. So she has this popularity and interest. And [she] increasingly shows up in funny pop culture ways. I think in the last episode of ""Lost"" the character was reading ""Everything That Rises Must Converge"" in the last scene. So, counterintuitively, she's only growing in importance. CNN: It's amazing that she had a literary career at all, given how debilitating her illness was. Gooch: What became inspiring to me, unexpectedly, writing this book [was how she dealt] with her illness, and that she finally was nobody's victim. ... Everything we think of as a Flannery O'Connor story came after she had been diagnosed as having lupus and settled in to life in the South. You get the sense that this was almost a magical thinking, where she thought that writing these stories was keeping her alive.","New biography of Flannery O'Connor offers insights on Southern author .

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN)  -- A security breach at Newark Liberty International Airport Sunday evening forced the closure of a terminal for hours while authorities rescreened thousands of passengers. The incident happened at about 5:20 p.m. at Terminal C, when a man walked through an exit on the public side to the secure ""sterile"" side for passengers who had cleared screening, according to the Transportation Security Administration. ""Rescreening began after the Port Authority Police and TSA swept each of the concourses in the terminal with negative findings,"" said Ann Davis, a TSA spokeswoman. ""The man in question was never located; however, TSA's rescreening effort will ensure that every passenger boarding an aircraft tonight out of Newark's Terminal C has been fully screened."" Watch more about the situation in Newark . All passengers had been rescreened by early Monday, according to the TSA. Flights from Terminal C were grounded until the process was completed. iReport: Passenger photographs massive crowd . Authorities reviewed video from airport cameras but were not sure whether the man was once on the sterile side and went back or if he never went through screening, Davis said. The incident caused arrival delays and mainly affected Continental Airlines, which is the airport's largest tenant. CNN's Alina Cho, who arrived at the airport Sunday night on a flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, described a hectic scene, saying many passengers who had already boarded outgoing flights had to get off planes to be rescreened. Flying Continental? Important company notice . ""I just saw one woman pleading with a gate agent, saying that she had two small children and a heart condition -- that she simply could not take this,"" Cho said. ""But of course, there will be no exceptions."" Newark Liberty International Airport, which is about 15 miles from Manhattan, is the second-largest hub for Continental. The airport handles about 35 million passengers a year. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","Security breach at Sunday evening forces  closure of Terminal C for hours .

"Washington (CNN) -- Foreign nationals who are HIV-positive will find it easier starting Monday to visit the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed HIV infection from the list of diseases that prevent non-U.S. citizens from entering the country. HIV is the human immunodeficiency virus -- the virus that causes AIDS. Advocates for HIV-positive people said the new policy was long overdue, calling it ""a significant step forward for the United States."" ""The end of the HIV travel and immigration ban is the beginning of a new life for countless families and thousands who had been separated because of this policy,"" said Steve Ralls, spokesman for Immigration Equality, a national rights organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and HIV-positive individuals. ""This is a new beginning for them."" The final rule was approved in November and went into effect Monday. The new regulation takes HIV infection out of the category of ""communicable diseases of public health significance,"" the CDC said. It also removes required testing for HIV infection from the U.S. immigration medical screening process and eliminates the need for a waiver for entry into the United States. U.S. laws and regulations enacted since 1952 have made persons ""who were afflicted with any dangerous contagious disease"" ineligible to receive a visa to enter the country. People infected with HIV have been restricted since 1987, when Congress directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to add HIV to its list of diseases of public health significance. The United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, which President Bush signed on July 30, 2008, removed the statutory requirement that mandated the inclusion of HIV on the list of diseases of public health significance that barred entry in the United States. The legislation did not, however, automatically change the existing regulations, administered by HHS, that continued to list HIV as a ""communicable disease of public-health significance"" and required the more cumbersome visa process. The United States was one of 13 countries that restricted entry of HIV-positive visitors, according to amfAR, an AIDS research foundation.","Travel and immigration ban on HIV-positive travelers lifted .

"(CNN) -- Mexico issued a hurricane warning for the southern Baja California peninsula Monday in preparation for Hurricane Jimena, a powerful Category 4 storm with winds near 155 mph (250 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Forecasters expect Hurricane Jimena to approach the southwestern tip of Baja California's peninsula Tuesday. A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected within 24 hours. The storm could bring as much as 2 feet of rain to the area, along with dangerous, battering waves, forecasters said. Jimena was centered about 285 miles (460 km) south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, according to the hurricane center. It was traveling northwest near 10 mph (17 kph) but meteorologists expect Jimena to pick up speed in the coming day. Forecasters expect the storm to continue in a northwest motion and approach the southwestern tip of Baja California Tuesday, forecasters said. ""It's not expected to change in strength very much during the next day or so,"" said Daniel Brown, a hurricane specialist at the center.  See the storm's projected path Â» . ""It may begin to weaken a little as it approaches the Baja peninsula, but it's expected to remain a very dangerous hurricane, perhaps a Category 3 as it approaches that area."" Jimena is the 10th named storm of the Pacific season. Residents in spots expected to be hit by Jimena should prepare for potentially rough conditions, Brown said. Tropical Storm Kevin is also making its presence felt in the Pacific Ocean, just to the west of Jimena, but it is weak and is not expected to do any damage, according to Brown. ""For the eastern Pacific, it has been about a near-normal season. It has gotten much busier here during the month of August,"" Brown said. CNN's John Lorinc contributed to this report.","NEW: Hurricane warning issued for the southern Baja California peninsula .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran plans to launch satellites into orbit early in the new year, its defense minister told the semi-official Fars news agency Wednesday. ""This satellite, which was built by Iranian scientists, is a big step for the continued presence of Iran in space and for taking advantage of the opportunities offered in this field,"" Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said. The launches of the Tolou satellites -- which means ""sunrise"" in Farsi -- are scheduled to take place in February and March, according to Fars. Iran launched its first satellite, Omid, in February, an event that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hailed at the time as a ""source of pride"" for the Islamic republic. The U.S. State Department expressed ""grave concern"" over the launch. ""Developing a space launch vehicle that could ... put a satellite into orbit could possibly lead to development of a ballistic missile system,"" State Department deputy spokesman Robert Wood told reporters. ""So that's of grave concern to us."" The Pentagon called the February launch ""clearly a concern of ours."" ""Although this appears to be satellite, there are dual-use capabilities that could be applied to missiles, and that's a concern to us and everybody in region,"" Defense Department spokesman Geoff Morrell said at the time. For Iran, the planned launches are an important step for its military. ""Using these modern technologies, Iran's armed forces are capable of catching the enemies off guard, identifying their software and hardware potential and depriving the enemy of movement and maneuverability,"" Vahidi told Fars. The development comes as the international community considers additional sanctions against Iran should Tehran not answer questions about its nuclear program. Western powers fear Iran is intent on developing nuclear weapons, an allegation Tehran denies.","Iran reportedly plans to launch Tolou satellites into orbit in February and March .

"London, England (CNN) -- A controversial British Muslim cleric is threatening to stage a march through the town that receives the bodies of British war dead as a protest against the war in Afghanistan, drawing fury and outrage. Anjem Choudary has accused soldiers of ""murderous crimes,"" and said the United States and United Kingdom are seeking to ""establish their own military, economic, strategic and ideological interests in the region."" British and American troops are suffering ""depression"" as they realize ""there is no real moral or ethic (sic) reason for them to murder innocent men, women and children to fulfill their politicians (sic) agenda,"" the preacher says. His organization proposes to parade empty coffins through the streets of the English town of Wootton Bassett, where the bodies of British war dead are traditionally brought when they return to the country. Relatives and friends line the streets of the town along with local residents as hearses carry the flag-draped British remains, in scenes of public mourning widely reported by British media. Choudary has not announced a date for his planned march and local police said Saturday he had not contacted them about it, as people planning marches are required to do before staging a demonstration. But the threat itself prompted more than 215,000 people to join a Facebook group opposing the march as of Monday, a day after he posted a letter online justifying it. ""The highway for heroes & wonderful people of WB do not deserve this march to happen,"" the group's home page says. ""This group can march anywhere it wishes in the country but have chosen WB to cause outrage & offense. Islam4UK is an extremists (sic) Islamic group & does not represent the Muslim community in this country."" Choudary's open letter, ""To the Families of British Soldiers who have died or who are currently in Afghanistan,"" appeared on the Web site of his organization, Islam4UK, on Sunday. The group had announced its intention to stage the protest earlier in a short statement on its Web site. ""The procession in Wootton Basset (sic) is therefore an attempt to engage the British publics (sic) minds on the real reasons why their soldiers are returning home in body bags and the real cost of the war,"" Choudary wrote. ""The parades, the speeches about soldiers doing their duty and the feeling of patriotism has obfuscated the reality of the conflict and the murderous crimes being committed by the occupiers and their agents. The British public is blissfully unaware of what is being done in their name,"" Choudary wrote. ""Afghanistan is not a British Town near Wootton Basset (sic) but rather Muslim land which no one has the right to occupy, with a Muslim population who do not deserve their innocent men, women and children to be killed for political mileage and for the greedy interests of the oppressive U.S. and UK regimes,"" he said. Choudary signs himself ""UK Head of Al-Muhajiroun,"" a banned British group which supports al Qaeda. Choudary spoke positively of Osama Bin Laden in the letter and in interviews with British media on Monday. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Sunday that there would be ""no support"" for the march or Choudary's ""perverted view of Islam."" ""I think most people in the Islamic community believe that those people who have adopted a perverted view of Islam to justify murder as terrorism are outside the traditional elements of what is a peaceful faith,"" he said. ""The vast majority of the Muslim population in this country and other countries agrees with my view on this,"" Brown said. Police in Wiltshire, the county where Wootton Bassett is located, said they had the authority to control the terms and conditions of the march or even to apply to ban it if Choudary took steps towards staging it. ""If the march or procession is believed to be likely to result in serious disorder, disruption or damage, then the police can impose conditions upon the organizer,"" the police said in a statement. ""In exceptional circumstances, the police may apply to the Local Authority for an order prohibiting such a march."" ""To date there has been no contact from Islam4UK or any other group wishing to arrange such a march in Wootton Bassett,"" they said.","Anjem Choudary accuses soldiers of ""murderous crimes"" in Afghanistan .

"CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico (CNN) -- Hurricane Jimena weakened to a Category 3 storm Tuesday afternoon, but remained dangerous as it bore down on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California, with the resort town of Cabo San Lucas in its path. Jimena bears down Tuesday evening on Baja California, with the resort town of Cabo San Lucas in its path. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Erika formed in the Atlantic on Tuesday, east of the northern Leeward Islands, the National Hurricane Center said. Jimena's maximum wind speed dropped from 125 mph to 120 mph (195 kph), according to the U.S. National Weather Service's 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) update. ""A gradual weakening is forecast during the next 24 to 48 hours,"" the weather service said. ""However, Jimena could be near major hurricane strength when it makes landfall."" The storm's center is forecast to come ashore on Thursday morning, but the weather service warned that ""because it will be moving parallel to the coastline, any slight change in direction could have a huge impact in the location and timing of landfall."" Mexico's government extended a hurricane warning for most of the southern half of the Baja peninsula -- from Punta Abreojos on the peninsula's west coast to Mulege on its east coast, according to the National Weather Service.  See the storm's projected path Â» . A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in the next 24 hours and people should quickly prepare ""to protect life and property."" ""A dangerous storm surge along with battering waves will produce significant coastal flooding along the Baja California Peninsula,"" NWS said. On its current track, Jimena's center will approach the peninsula's southern portion later on Tuesday and central Baja California peninsula by Thursday, the weather service said. In addition to damaging winds, the storm could bring as much as 15 inches of rain, forecasters said. Jimena -- the 10th named storm of the Pacific season -- was centered about 85 miles (135 km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, according to the weather service. It was traveling north-northwest near 12 mph (19 kph). On Tuesday, the skies in Cabo San Lucas were overcast and gusts of wind began to pick up. There were good waves for surfing, but popular beaches were devoid of tourists. Red flags warned people to stay out of the water, in case they needed any reminding. The day before, airlines offered extra flights to leave the area. Lionel Alvarez, who runs a resort hotel called ""Las Ventanas al Pariaso"" in the town of San Jose del Cabo, found a silver lining to the coming storm. ""The wind is refreshing a little bit because of the high temperatures we've gone through in the past few days,"" he said. But Alvarez, like other locals, had work to do in preparation of Jimena. ""We protect the property by dismantling all that could be dangerous, fly or can be broken,"" he said. Authorities had asked about 10,000 people to evacuate the area, but many had decided to wait out the storm. Cuauhtemoc Morgan, a local resident of Los Cabos who sent videos to to CNN's iReport, said residents had protected every home in his neighborhood, fortifying windows with masking tape. Lines at supermarkets were long with worried residents preparing for the storms, Morgan said. See iReport videos . Authorities were setting up shelters in schools and trying to devise a plan to protect the homeless, he added. The Pacific isn't the only place seeing action. As of 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, tropical storm watches were issued for the Caribbean islands of St. Maarten, Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Martin and St. Barthelemy by the governments of France, the Netherlands Antilles, and Antigua and Barbuda, according to the hurricane center. A tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions, including winds of at least 39 mph, are possible within 36 hours.  See Erika's projected path Â» . Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should monitor Erika's progress, forecasters advised. Erika's center was about 390 miles (625 km) east of the northern Leeward Islands, the hurricane center said. Its maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph (80 kph), with higher gusts. While Erika meandered Tuesday afternoon, it was expected to start moving west-northwest at about 9 mph during the night. ""Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days,"" forecasters said. Tropical-storm force winds extended outward up to 105 miles (170 km) from Erika's center. The storm was moving west-northwest at near 9 mph (15 kph), and was expected to continue doing so for the next couple of days, the hurricane center said. Tracking maps put the storm east of the Bahamas by Sunday. On the forecast track, Erika should remain northeast of the Leeward Islands, forecasters said. CNN's Betty Nguyen and CNN Radio's Matt Cherry and Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.","Hurricane Jimena downgraded to Category 3, hurricane center says .

"London, England (CNN) -- Union officials were going to court Thursday in London to try to stop British Airways from imposing contractual changes on its 14,000-member cabin crew. The Unite union said it wants the High Court to issue an injunction against the British carrier to stop ""unfair and unworkable"" changes to cabin crew contracts. It was unclear when the court would rule in the case. Among the changes BA wants to impose is a reduction in the number of crew members on flights, Unite said. BA plans to impose the changes starting November 16, according to Unite. Thursday's court action is separate from union plans to ballot its members about whether to strike over the Christmas holiday period, a Unite spokeswoman said. Unite still plans to hold the strike ballot, possibly as early as next week, regardless of how the High Court rules, she said. The contractual changes are part of the strike ballot, but other issues include jobs and pay, she said.","Union Unite says it is taking British Airways to court over working changes .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Yemen, which was closed over the weekend because of security concerns, reopened Tuesday, a day after Yemeni forces conducted successful security operations. A statement posted on the embassy's Web site said ""successful counter-terrorism operations"" conducted by Yemeni security forces on Monday, north of the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, addressed ""a specific area of concern and have contributed to the Embassy's decision to resume operations."" Yemen's state-run news agency, SABA, reported Monday that two al Qaeda suspects were killed and two others were injured in clashes with a Yemeni anti-terrorism unit . However, Mohamed Ahmed al-Haniq, the al Qaeda unit's leader, and an unknown number of his ""companions"" were able to escape during the clashes, SABA reported, citing Yemen's Interior Ministry. The U.S. Embassy said the threat of terrorist attacks against American interests in Yemen ""remains high,"" and it urged American citizens in the country ""to be vigilant and take prudent security measures."" Yemen fertile ground for terror groups . A senior State Department official, who did not want to speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the information, said Yemeni authorities have helped the United States with additional security precautions at the embassy site. The United States' decision to close its embassy came after intelligence suggested that four al Qaeda operatives were planning an attack on the compound, a senior administration official said Monday. The official said the United States had information that a group of eight terrorists had been planning an attack. Yemeni forces killed three in recent days and another was captured wearing a suicide vest, but the other four were believed to be at large, the official said. It was not immediately clear if the same al Qaeda members in Monday's clashes were among the group of eight suspected terrorists. U.S. lawmakers have highlighted what they say are the threats posed by terrorists in Yemen. ""As we commit ourselves to the fight in Afghanistan, some of the what I'll call the enemy forces, the extremist forces, move to new bases of operation such as Yemen, from which they strike us,"" said Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, at a news conference with Sen. John McCain in Iraq Tuesday. ""I've been quoting something that was said to us by an American working in Yemen when Sen. McCain and I visited in August, which was perhaps a bit overstated but it makes a point. He said to me: 'Iraq was yesterday's war. Afghanistan is today's war. And if we do not act preemptively now, Yemen will be tomorrow's war.'"" McCain noted that on the visit he had a ""very strong impression"" about the nation's difficulties, particularly the presence of al Qaeda. ""The government of Yemen is going to need our help in combatting al Qaeda,"" McCain, R-Arizona, said. ""There needs to be significant effort made in improving their economy, and we cannot allow Yemen to be a base for al Qaeda to mount attacks on other countries in the region as well as the U.S."" On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the situation in Yemen a possible threat to regional and global security, but commended Yemen for taking action against al Qaeda networks. The United States and Britain closed their embassies Sunday. Britain's Foreign Office also cited security concerns and its embassy remained closed Tuesday. ""The British Embassy in Yemen will remain closed to the public today,"" a statement from the embassy said. ""Some embassy personnel will be in and whoever needs to contact the embassy can do it via the phone or e-mail but people won't be able to walk into the embassy."" Several other nations also made changes at their Yemen-based embassies Monday, including Japan, France, Spain and Germany. Each cited the need for increased security measures. France closed its embassy to the public, although French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero said Tuesday that embassy employees will continue their work. Valero said the embassy will reopen once work to secure the site, already in progress before the latest threat, is finished. Spain also restricted public access to its embassy, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said, adding that the embassy continued to function ""normally."" Japan halted service at the consulate section of its embassy. The Japanese Foreign Ministry said the decision was based on the threat of terror, not a specific threat. Germany said that while its embassy remained fully operational, security measures were increased. The German Foreign Ministry said fewer visitors were allowed into the embassy compound. The wave of concerns follow last month's alleged attempted terrorist attack by a Nigerian man who boarded a flight in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and allegedly tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight approached Detroit, Michigan. The attempt failed, and other passengers and crew grabbed the suspect. The Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the Christmas Day plot. U.S. President Barack Obama has also linked the suspect, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, to the group, which is a combination of al Qaeda networks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The AQAP group in Yemen has said that the attempted attack on the airliner was in retaliation for airstrikes against it on December 17 and 24. However, Yemen has said that AbdulMutallab purchased his ticket on December 16. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen has come under attack numerous times in recent years. In September 2008, 10 people were killed -- among them police and civilians, but no embassy employees -- when insurgents opened fire and set off explosions outside the compound.","U.S. Embassy in Yemen reopens after being closed due to threats by al Qaeda .

"OLD TOWN ALEXANDRIA, Virginia (CNN) -- As you walk down Prince Street in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, it may be easy to forget that it's 2009. Music preservationist Curtis Blues works the streets of Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. You might find a wooden-wheeled carriage rolling by, drawn by a mule. Holding the reins and telling the history of the town is a woman dressed in clothing of an era long past. Gas lanterns burn and adorn intricate woodwork on townhouse entrances. Cobblestone streets preserving the past lead the way to the waterfront, where the old Torpedo Factory lies. And if you listen carefully, you can hear the sounds of the past echoing in the alleys and old tunnels. The sounds come courtesy of musician Curtis Blues. ""This is a one-string diddley bow,"" Blues says as he picks up a crude, homemade instrument constructed from items you might find in any kitchen. ""They used to tie a wire on a barn door and amplify it with a metal jar top."" He picks up the portable version of the diddley bow and plucks the one string. He uses a metal slide to change the pitch and creates a rather unique musical sound. Although Blues hadn't yet begun performing, a crowd of curious tourists gathers to watch. Blues is a Mississippi Delta Blues preservationist. He owns a plethora of instruments that were used by delta musicians starting around the turn of the 20th century. He picks up his harmonica and begins to play. Powerful bending notes fly from it as he demonstrates how his heroes used the shape of their mouths to create a louder, richer sound that would reach more people on the streets. Blues started playing blues harmonica when he was 14 years old, and he has been studying, learning and performing blues music ever since. ""This acoustic style of music, I grew up with on the folk circuit. So I was exposed to some of the old blues men, and I fell in love with it,"" Blues says. ""My mission is to preserve it as the acoustic form it was before it went to Chicago and became electric band music."" He adds: ""So it's a preservation of an era, a moment in history, and a style of performance. One of the aspects of my preservation work is to preserve the voice of these unique instruments of this era.""  Watch Blues ply his trade Â» . For the past 14 years, Blues has had a one-man-band blues show that he performs in the shadow of the Old Torpedo Factory, located on the boardwalk in the heart of Old Town. His show finds him with a bright silver metal resonator guitar, a harmonica mounted around his neck, and a bass drum with cymbals. ""They performed in settings just like this on the side of the river,"" Blues says of the old-time blues musicians. ""So when I'm playing out here I'm really stepping into their shoes. But there's no assumption that anyone has to pay me at all. The term in Europe is called 'busking.' The idea behind busking is that you're turning a stranger into a paying customer in just a few seconds."" One of Blues' ""busking"" techniques is to get the kids involved. ""Would you like to be part of my band?"" he asks a shy little red-haired girl hiding behind her mother's leg. ""I could use a pretty girl like you in my band! Come on up here and grab a maraca."" Blues soon has a small percussion section to his right, and each child has a parent holding a dollar for the children to place into his tip box after the song in appreciation of the fun that has been added to their day. Near the end of the song, Blues lowers the music and addresses the crowd. ""Now if you're thinking of tipping me today and I hope you are, please consider my huge family!"" And he gestures to the several children next to him holding colorful plastic maracas. ""And that little one there,"" he goes on, ""he eats the most out of all of them.""

It is literally a wooden cigar box that is attached to a long wooden neck with four strings fastened at either end. He describes the instrument to a few very interested onlookers.

""The future of the blues is very bright,"" says Blues, ""because the human spirit always resonates and relates to the blues."" The sun begins to set.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- International aid groups were feverishly trying to get supplies into quake-ravaged Haiti on Thursday to prevent the situation from going from ""dire to absolutely catastrophic."" The search-and-rescue efforts are the top priority. ""The ability to get people out of that rubble is paramount,"" said Jonathan Aiken, a spokesman for the American Red Cross. ""You have a very limited time to accomplish that before people die and before you start to get into issues of diseases."" Behind the scenes, a massive coordination effort involving dozens of aid groups, the Haitian government, the United Nations and the U.S. military was under way to get food, water, tents and other supplies to survivors of the 7.0-magnitude earthquake. Ian Rodgers, a senior emergency adviser for Save the Children, said aid efforts were at a ""tipping point."" ""People are without water; children are without food and without shelter,"" he said. ""What we will see with the lack of water is the possibility of diarrheal diseases and, of course, that can kill children in a matter of hours if not tended to appropriately. ""It is very possible,"" Rodgers said, ""that the situation can go from dire to absolutely catastrophic if we don't get enough food, medicine and work with children and their families to help them."" In the United States, President Obama promised the people of Haiti that ""you will not be forsaken."" ""Today, you must know that help is arriving,"" Obama said. Precise casualty estimates were impossible to determine. Haitian President Rene Preval said Wednesday that he had heard estimates of up to 50,000 dead but that it was too early to know for sure. The Haitian prime minister said he worries that several hundred thousand people were killed. The country's infrastructure has been devastated, the scope of the calamity enormous. ""The government personnel that would normally lead these types of responses, they themselves have been affected,"" Rodgers said. The Haitian government stopped accepting flights Thursday because ramp space at the airport in the capital city, Port-au-Prince, was saturated and no fuel was available, said Federal Aviation Adminstration spokeswoman Laura Brown. Meanwhile, the pier used for delivery of cargo to Port-au-Prince was ""completely compromised"" by Tuesday's earthquake, said CNN's Eric Marrapodi. Three ships filled with medical supplies, food, clothing and water were turned away, he said. Roads leading into the city from the dock were bucked about 5 feet high by the earthquake, he said. Relief agencies are focusing on food, shelter, medical care and communications, all of which will help establish a sense of security, Aiken said. ""The people will at least know that the world is paying attention to them."" Supplies and security . A bottleneck of supplies has built up while authorities have tried to get Haiti's main airport functioning. Rubble-strewn roads, downed trees and a battered communications network have hampered humanitarian efforts. Aftershocks continue to jolt the region, causing further fear and panic among residents. ""We're going to have to wait for this pipeline of aid coming in from various places around the world to be set up and put into full gear before Haitians can get all the help that they need,"" Aiken said. ""You're going to start seeing some progress on that today."" While planes were able to bring in the first round of supplies, the question became, Aiken said, ""how do you get it to the folks who need it?"" Impact Your World: How you can help . Haiti isn't accustomed to quakes and doesn't have the heavy equipment or specialized machinery to help clear the rubble, Aiken said. Aid groups and government agencies are coordinating to get the equipment in. ""It's basically a matter of clearing out the rubble, making sure that areas are workable, that you have security that can protect these supplies and that you have security in place to help people,"" Aiken said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said a contingent of 2,000 U.S. Marines will help the international peacekeeping and police force established after the 2004 ouster of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. ""We'll try to support them as they re-establish authority,"" Clinton said. The American Red Cross emptied a warehouse in Panama that had been filled with everything from cooking kits to toiletries to medical supplies and tents. That load of supplies is likely to make it into Haiti on Thursday, Aiken said. ""Our effort is immediate relief and supplies."" ""The needs are overwhelming at this point in time,"" Rodgers said. ""We are going to be doing our best to respond to that, but obviously that's a big task at hand."" Medical emergency . Hospitals in Port-au-Prince have collapsed, and the few facilities still open can't handle the needs of the injured. The United States and other countries were dispatching medical supplies, facilities and personnel. People who suffered broken bones from falling debris have been unable to get treatment; there's simply too many of them. ""We need medical help,"" Haitian President Rene Preval said. ""Some of the hospitals, they collapsed. The hospitals, they are full, and they put people in the outside."" Clinton said, ""Just getting to people to provide the medical assistance they need is proving to be very difficult."" See CNN's complete coverage of the quake . Barbara DeBuono, the former commissioner of health for New York state, said the coordination between the U.S. military and groups like the Red Cross is essential to treating the sick and injured. ""Making sure that the right hand knows what the left hand is doing is really, really critical here, so that there isn't further chaos and confusion."" Aiken said officials would assess the situation on the ground and coordinate medical efforts. As the days go by, health concerns will grow about diseases, like cholera and tuberculosis, from the thousands of corpses on streets and in the rubble. The bodies also can affect the water supply and sanitation. ""You can have airborne diseases,"" Aiken said. ""You can have animals carrying [diseases] feeding off these corpses."" Haiti could also have a humanitarian crisis since tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed, forcing residents onto residents. ""There needs to be a place to put people and to set up a structure like a refugee camp,"" Aiken said. ""That's all part of this."" But he said, for now, the priority is to rescue as many people as possible -- and get supplies in as quickly as possible.","Pipeline of aid backed up as Port-au-Prince airport reopens .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- People who knew and studied Maj. Nidal Hasan say he was a loner who had no luck finding a wife, and a criminal profiler said the Fort Hood shooting suspect fits the profile of a mass murderer better than that of a terrorist. Investigators are searching for any missed ""red flags"" that might have prevented last week's fatal shooting, which left 12 soldiers and one civilian dead and 40 other people wounded. However, the FBI has said its investigations indicate the ""alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot."" ""A lot of people are jumping to the conclusion because this man spouted violent Islamic ideology that this is a terrorist attack,"" criminologist Pat Brown said. Brown, who profiles killers, said Hasan's profile is that of a loner. ""He was simply a lone guy who had issues, problems, psychopathic behaviors that escalated to the point where he wanted to get back at society, and he took it out on his workmates like most of them do,"" he said. A cleric at the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia, where Hasan attended when he lived in the area, said Hasan seemed to become ""somewhat withdrawn"" after the death of his mother in 2001. ""Some individuals said that their experience with him, that he changed after his mother passed away,"" Imam Johari Abdul-Malik said. Another cleric there, Shaikh Shaker Elsayed, said efforts to find a wife for Hasan were unsuccessful. ""Well, we were not successful in matching him with somebody,"" he said. Hasan, a 39-year-old psychiatrist, came under investigation last year when his communications with radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators who were monitoring al-Awlaki, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. But an employee of the Defense Department's Criminal Investigative Services, assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, decided to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan's personnel files. A senior Defense Department official said the task force's ground rules prevented that information from being transmitted outside the task force, although others disputed that. ""I find it hard to believe that they would just say, 'OK, we're not going to share any of this information with the military,' "" HLN law enforcement analyst Mike Brooks said. ""I mean, that's why you have a person from the military, from different military branches, on the task force to be the liaison."" A former counterterrorism official said the information about Hasan's communications with the imam should have been shared with the military unless the FBI specifically forbade it. Still, one source familiar with the investigation said Hasan's communications with al-Awlaki appeared innocent in nature. Another federal source familiar with the investigation said Hasan's actions give no indication he was following the guidance in al Qaeda's terrorist handbook in the weeks before Thursday's attack. That handbook directs jihadists to conceal their religion, mask their beliefs and blend in. Instead, Hasan frequently appeared in public in traditional Muslim clothing and prayed daily at the local mosque, making no attempt to hide his religion or conservative beliefs, the source said. Hasan remained hospitalized Wednesday in stable condition and has not been formally charged with any of the 13 deaths in last week's shooting. His civilian attorney, retired Army Col. John Galligan, said he has spoken with his client, but that he was heavily sedated. ""I think the closest thing that indicates that there's a court-martial in the works is last night about 8 I did receive an e-mail from the prosecutor at Fort Hood indicating to me that the pass privileges and leave privileges of Maj. Hasan had been revoked,"" Galligan said. CNN's Drew Griffin, Elaine Quijano, Carol Cratty and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","Profiler: Hasan fits profile of mass murderer better than that of terrorist .

"(CNN) -- The man identified as the double agent who killed eight people at a U.S. base in Afghanistan was a Jordanian doctor recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source, a senior Jordanian official said Tuesday. A former U.S. intelligence official identified the suicide bomber Monday as Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi. The Jordanian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said authorities in Jordan arrested al-Balawi more than a year ago ""for some suspicious information related to him"" but released him because of a lack of evidence. ""After few months, he got in touch with us through the Internet and sent us several e-mails that include very important and rather dangerous information that might affect the security and stability of the country,"" the official said. ""We kept in touch with him through e-mails in order to get more information and also trying to bring him over to be able to get more information. We shared and exchanged the information he gave us with some other friendly countries that are involved in countering terrorism."" The official said Jordan could not confirm that al-Balawi was the bomber, ""because we are not on the ground."" ""But we are not denying that if he is the one, then he is the Jordanian doctor,"" the official said. The December 30 blast at a U.S. base in Khost, in southeastern Afghanistan, killed seven CIA operatives including two from private security firm Xe, formerly known as Blackwater. The eighth victim was Jordanian Army Capt. Sharif Ali bin Zeid, a cousin of Jordan's King Abdullah II. U.S. sources said bin Zeid was the Jordanian operative working closely with al-Balawi, who was from the same hometown as the onetime leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed that al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's No. 2 figure, the former intelligence official said. In a posting on its Web site last week, the Taliban in Afghanistan claimed that the bomber was an Afghan National Army soldier. On Sunday, however, Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud said in an e-mail that his arm of the Islamic movement carried out the attack, using a Jordanian national. Mehsud's message predicted, ""This will be admitted by the CIA and the Jordanian government."" The attack was ""a huge blow, symbolically and tactically,"" because it eliminated such a large number of CIA officers, who can require years to become ingrained in the region, said Reva Bhalla, director of analysis for the international intelligence firm STRATFOR. In addition, the attack showed the ability of the Taliban to penetrate perhaps the most difficult of targets: a CIA base, she said. Former CIA official Robert Richer called it the greatest loss of life for the agency since the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight agents. An American intelligence official vowed last week that the United States would avenge the attack.","Jordanian doctor Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi identified as bomber .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the wake of the suicide bombing at Forward Operating Base Chapman, new security guidance has gone out to U.S. bases across Afghanistan, U.S. military officials said. The December 30 suicide attack killed seven CIA officers and contractors, along with a Jordanian military officer who was the attacker's handler. Former CIA official Robert Richer called it the greatest loss of life for the agency since the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight agents. A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN on Wednesday the attack was believed to have come on orders from ""the highest levels"" of al Qaeda. Bruce Reidel, a former CIA officer who has advised President Obama on al Qaeda, said the attack showed the capacity of terrorists to strike at U.S. targets remained ""very significant."" ""It's a very, very sophisticated operation,"" Reidel said. ""It must have taken a long time to plan and to set up."" In response, U.S. military officials said they were changing procedures. ""Suffice it to say that after any serious incident we evaluate the circumstances, think through the threat implications given our current practices and disseminate guidance to the field if adjustments are necessary,"" a senior military official said. The official would not describe the new security procedures because ""we don't broadcast the specific changes we've made to security postures or our intelligence procedures."" A second U.S. military official said the guidance is meant to adjust procedures as quickly as possible on a large scale. ""We don't want just the military intelligence guys looking out for specific things. We need MPs and ground forces to be aware,"" the official said. The official said the security guidance is meant to be disseminated to as wide a group as possible, while more specific guidance on intelligence operations is kept to a much more limited, restricted distribution. The officials had not seen specific guidance on handling sources, but both noted only one week has passed since the incident, and the investigation may not have progressed far enough to produce formal recommendations in that area. One official said the intelligence officers on the ground now know enough details to ""self-correct"" procedures. According to sources, the Jordanian suicide bomber was Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, a one-time militant who then appeared to be helping the United States. Al-Balawi was offering information on the possible whereabouts of Ayman al Zawahiri, the deputy to Osama bin Laden, the sources said, and was picked up outside the base and driven into it without being checked. The sources said al-Balawi detonated the bomb shortly after arriving. The attack shed light on the role of Jordan as a previously covert partner in the U.S. hunt for bin Laden and Zawahiri. ""The Jordanian intelligence service is the best intelligence service in the Middle East and South Asia, bar none,"" Reidel said. ""They are far more effective in working against jihadist groups like al Qaeda in Iraq like the al Qaeda core in Pakistan than any other intelligence service."" CNN's Barbara Starr and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","Senior official: ""After any serious incident we evaluate the circumstances""

"(CNN) -- Captain Graeme Smith ground out a potentially match-winning century to put South Africa on top in the third cricket Test against England at Newlands on Tuesday. The left-hander was unbeaten on 162 at stumps on the third day, having added a record 230 for the second wicket with Hashim Amla (95) as the home side reached 312-2 in Cape Town's intense heat. England struggled from the outset, losing two wickets in the day's opening over and added just 32 runs to their overnight total of 241-7. That gave the Proteas a first-innings lead of 18 runs, and it looked like the home side might also find batting difficult when makeshift opener Ashwell Prince continued his miserable series, falling leg before wicket to spinner Graeme Swann for 15. But Smith and Amla set about the English attack, who gained no profit from a controversial incident when seamer Chris Broad stood on the ball with his studded boots before lunch when it was still relatively new. Smith survived a series of close calls and decision referrals as the duo set a new Test highest mark for the second wicket at the venue. The opener thought he was out soon after reaching his 19th century in the five-day format, but England wicketkeeper Matt Prior admitted that the edge off seamer Graham Onions had not carried. Amla finally fell to a bat-pad catch by Alistair Cook off Swann, falling five runs short of his eighth Test ton as he hit 14 boundaries off 156 deliveries. First-innings centurion Jacques Kallis was unbeaten on 20 at stumps, with Smith having plundered 22 boundaries in his 243 balls at the crease. Earlier, Morne Morkel (5-75) took two wickets in two balls to put England on the back foot, with Swann caught at slip by Smith for five from a fierce rising delivery and James Anderson following in identical fashion. Prior, who was 52 overnight, hit out to get England close to parity before dragging a short ball from Dale Steyn (4-74) onto his wicket to be last out for 76. England coach Andy Flower said Wednesday's morning session would prove vital for his side, who lead 1-0 after winning the second Test. ""We have got to attack with the new ball. We have seen wickets fall early on all the days so far. We have definitely got to attack early,"" the former Zimbabwe international player said. ""The first two days produced very difficult batting conditions, today was easier. We don't know what sort of conditions are going to arrive tomorrow. If it plays as easy as it has today, we have got a chance.""","South Africa captain Graeme Smith scores potentially match-winning unbeaten 162 .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The chairman of India's fourth-largest software-services provider resigned Wednesday after confessing to inflating the company's profits for years with ""fictitious"" assets and non-existent cash. Satyam Chairman B. Ramalinga Raju . The news sent stocks of the Hyderabad-based Satyam Computer Services into free fall. Stocks plummeted more than 70 percent within hours after the revelation. The major stock index in India -- the BSE SENSEX -- fell 7.3 percent Wednesday. Satyam employs 53,000 people, operates in 65 countries and serves almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies. More than half of its revenue comes from the United States. Satyam Chairman B. Ramalinga Raju said the balance-sheet padding began several years ago to close ""a marginal gap"" between actual operating profit and one reflected in the company's accounting books. It continued through the years, he said. ""It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten,"" Raju said in a letter to the company's board of directors. Raju said no board member was aware of what he was doing and he did not profit from the inflated accounts. The deception came to light after Raju tried to plug the hole by getting Satyam to buy his son's construction companies. The acquisition was ""the last attempt to fill the fictitious assets with real ones,"" he wrote in his letter. The deal would have cost Satyam $1.6 billion -- but the company's board vetoed it. Stocks fell following the botched deal. Soon afterward, Raju came clean, saying he was doing so ""with deep regret, and tremendous burden that I am carrying on my conscience.""

"(CNN)  -- Defending World Cup champion Gregor Schlierenzauer of Austria claimed the second leg of the famous Four Hills ski-jumping tournament at Garmisch on New Year's Day. Schlierenzauer could only finish ninth in the first event at Oberstdorf on Tuesday, but made no mistake with leaps of 136.5 and 137.5m and good style marks for a total of 277.7 points. It gave him a comfortable advantage over fellow Austrian Wolfgang Loitzl, who twice jumped 135m for 272.5 points. Switzerland's double Olympic champion from 2002 in Salt Lake City, Simon  Ammann, showed he is running into form for Vancouver next February, after jumping 132 and 143.5m for 272.4 points and third place. Austrian Andreas Kofler, who won at Oberstdorf, maintained the overall lead in the four-event competition as he came in fourth with leaps of 136 and 137m for 271.9 points. Finland's five-time Four Hills champion Janne Ahonen, second at Oberstdorf on his comeback from retirement, finished sixth after jumps of 129.5 and 137m gave him 259.2 points. Kofler leads the standings with a 20-point lead over Loitzl with Ahonen third ahead of the next competition at Innsbruck on Sunday. The Four Hills concludes in Austria, at Bischofshofen on January 6. Ammann still leads the overall World Cup standings with Schlierenzauer closing up in second place and Kofler third.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Director Barry Levinson is the star of his new film. Well, almost. Director Barry Levinson sizes up politics and media in his new film, ""PoliWood."" In the Academy Award-winning filmmaker's new documentary ""PoliWood,"" Levinson takes a look at the world of policymakers and screen actors and ends up voicing his own ideas in the process. ""The fact that my voice is in it always scares me to death, because I never like to be on camera, period,"" Levinson said. (The ""Rain Man"" director has appeared in a handful of films, notably the Robert Redford-directed ""Quiz Show."") In ""PoliWood,"" Levinson follows a group of politically active actors to the Democratic and Republican conventions as they take in the theater of it all. The journey leads to President Obama's inauguration. ""PoliWood"" also explores the idea that the media have become confusing catalysts that blur the lines of reality and myth. Television, which was once a romanticized invention that brought entertainment and public service announcements into our homes, is now a portal for manipulating what we see, feel and think, in the film's presentation. CNN talked to Levinson about the politics of the media, Hollywood actors supporting candidates and ""PoliWood."" CNN: Tell me about the celebrity-politician-media link. Barry Levinson: Well, I think what happened is, you have this television screen, and everything has to go through that screen -- and at a certain point, I don't think that we can tell the difference between the celebrity and the politician. They both have to entertain us in some fashion. That's why I think, in second half of the 20th century, you saw this kind of change where John F. Kennedy was probably the first television politician. He came across, he was good-looking, he was great in the way he spoke; he had a certain sense of humor. Then you had Reagan. Someone looked at him giving a speech for Goldwater and said, you know, he could be a politician. Two years after that, he became governor of California. So anyone that is pleasant enough on television suddenly gets credentials, whether they have earned it or not. And there's that blurring of it between celebrity and politics and everything else. CNN: Do you think that most celebrities have a good understanding of the politicians they support, or do some just jump on the bandwagon? Levinson: I think ""PoliWood"" shows it in some ways and talks about it. But basically, to be honest, there is no upside for any actor to be politically involved other than the fact that they are concerned citizens. It doesn't benefit their career at all. The term ""celebrity"" is sort of a bogus term, though, in a lot of ways. CNN: Why? Levinson: Well because Paris Hilton and Susan Sarandon, they're both celebrities, but Paris Hilton hasn't ever really done anything, in a way. Susan Sarandon has been an actress whose done a lot of different roles, been around a long time, has been politically active, extremely smart and knowledgeable about that. But there's two women, they get exposure, but there's a huge difference between that. Some have earned it; some get that attention just by the way they look or the way they have carried on in public. CNN: There's a scene in ""PoliWood"" where actors sit down with regular people, and they talk about relating to one another. Levinson: Well, how is that so-called celebrities -- how would they possibly relate to the ordinary person? But 90 percent of them come from those families -- they come out of the Midwest or the South or the Northeast. They come out of working-class families primarily. And because of the nature of America, that if you have certain dreams, and ultimately those dreams can in fact come true, they benefited by the society that they live in. But their roots come from all these small towns around the country, so of course they can relate. CNN: Do you think the Democratic and Republican conventions are pure theater? Levinson: Oh, absolutely. There's no political content that takes place at a political convention. It used to be that they would hammer out a platform. You know, there's all kind of back-room meetings, so now it's a show. It is a show both places. CNN: What do you think of President Obama? Levinson: He obviously is great on TV, and he is extremely smart, and so what we're gonna see as it goes down the road, what changes does he actually bring about? How does he work with Congress? All of those particular issues. He understands TV, and he's a great communicator. Now, will he be good or bad? We'll see what happens in a four-year period from someone who has great capabilities -- where does it all go? It's too early to determine that. CNN: Do you watch much television, or do you have a cynical view about it? Levinson: I try to watch TV like anyone else. I like to tune in just to see what new shows are out there. And then there are certain shows that I just get infuriated over. And then there are so-called political shows that I have a difficult time with. And sometimes I sit, and images are flying by so fast in some of these pieces, I'm going, ""What is that about?"" I've no idea. It looks like a collision of images on the screen.","Barry Levinson's new film looks at how TV has influenced politics .

"London, England (CNN) -- A strike that would have crippled British Airways over Christmas and New Year's Day cannot go ahead, a judge ruled Thursday. Judge Laura Cox issued an injunction blocking the planned 12-day strike, which was set to start December 22 and could have affected up to 1 million passengers. The airline immediately issued a statement saying it is ""delighted for our customers. ""There was never any need for a strike and we hope that Unite will take this opportunity to reflect before deciding its next steps,"" BA said, referring to the union that planned the strike. ""Our customers do not believe that old-style trade union militancy is relevant to our efforts to move British Airways back toward profitability."" But Unite joint general secretaries Derek Simpson and Tony Woodley called it ""a disgraceful day for democracy when a court can overrule such an overwhelming decision by employees taken in a secret ballot. ""This dispute is not settled. Passing the buck to the courts to do management's job for them was never going to be the answer,"" they said, warning they could vote again to strike. ""BA must accept that there can be no resolution except through negotiation, failing which there will inevitably be a further ballot for industrial action."" Unite has been engaged in a bitter dispute with British Airways management. ""I'm not disappointed for the people that can get away at Christmas,"" Simpson told CNN. ""It was never our desire to hurt those people. What we wanted to do was force a negotiated settlement."" He said he is concerned the decision has ""hardened management's attitude"" toward negotiation. The union is unhappy with the airline's plans to change cabin crew conditions. Unite says working hours will be extended and crew levels will be cut, changes that will damage customer service and hit the British Airways brand. The airline says the changes will save the carrier $665 million. BA has been losing hundreds of millions of dollars each quarter this year. Cabin crew staff voted overwhelmingly in favor of the strike. But the airline argued in court that some of the workers who cast ballots had already taken voluntary redundancy -- or buyouts -- from the airline. Some 10,288 workers voted, of about 14,000 cabin crew staff overall. The airline's legal counsel, Bruce Carr, told the presiding judge that the balloting process contained ""serious and substantial irregularities."" Carr called the union's action in choosing to strike over Christmas ""willfully disproportionate and clearly unlawful."" He referred several times to the serious disruption that would be felt by the airline's passengers, saying some ""ordinary people will find it very difficult to understand."" Simpson said management imposed terms on the union members without agreement, and when Unite asked a court to stop it, the court did not. The fact that the court has now blocked the union from striking ""shows an imbalance in employment law,"" he said. Travel experts have said around 1 million British Airways passengers could have been affected by the strike, finding themselves stranded and unable to rebook their tickets during the busy travel period. Thursday brought disruption to thousands of passengers on another airline, one run by the small Scottish charter company Globespan. The company announced on its Web site that it has gone into administration and that all flights on its airline, Flyglobespan, have been canceled. Further travel headaches are in store for passengers of other airlines at Heathrow and Aberdeen airports next week. Unite said baggage handlers and check-in staff at the two airports plan a series of three separate walkouts starting next week in a dispute over pay and pensions. The strike is not related to the British Airways dispute. The baggage handlers and check-in staff are employed by SAS Ground Services UK Ltd. The strike will affect travelers on Turkish, Emirates and Thai airlines at Heathrow and passengers on KLM, Air France, Wideroe and Atlantic at Aberdeen, Unite said. The walkouts are scheduled for December 22-24, December 26-27 and January 3-4. Those passengers hoping to avoid air travel in Europe and take the train instead faced uncertainty after British-based drivers of the Eurostar train announced a series of two strikes starting this weekend. The drivers said they will strike Friday and Saturday, and again December 26 and 27. Eurostar, however, said service would not be affected, because drivers from France and Belgium would be used. The train line provides service between London and both Paris, France, and Brussels, Belgium. The union representing the drivers, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, said talks with Eurostar ""concerning international allowances"" broke down. The dispute is over how much drivers' meal allowances should be when they are in Paris and Brussels. A Eurostar spokeswoman said it offered the drivers what it believes is a reasonable amount, but the drivers rejected the offer. She would not divulge specifics of the offer, saying only that it was ""enough for a good meal."" --CNN Business Correspondent Jim Boulden contributed to this report.","High Court issues injunction stopping planned BA holiday strike .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of flights were delayed at India's New Delhi airport Monday after lizards, birds and jackals strayed on to a runway to seek refuge from the monsoon rains. Kids play cricket through a downpour in New Delhi as monsoon rains came early to the area this week. Animal rescuers rounded up the critters and moved them to habitats outside airport property. But the operation delayed several flights and shut down the runway for some time, airport spokesman Arun Arora said. Kartick Satyanarayan of the conservation group Wildlife SOS said the animals descended on the runway in search of dry ground. His group works with the airport to move wildlife from airport property to a sanctuary on the outskirts of the capital. ""It's been raining cats and dogs the last two days. And when it rains like this, water goes in and fills the burrows of these animals,"" he said. ""The runway,"" he added, ""is the only safe area. So they come out."" While monsoon rains typically sweep across the subcontinent in early June, they usually do not reach the capital city of New Delhi and other regions in northern India until early July.  Watch how Indians cope with monsoon waters Â» . They came about two weeks early in the northern part of the country this year, killing at least 20 people in landslides, home collapses and floods. The airport sits on more than 2,000 acres that, over the years, have become home to jackals, porcupines, dogs, cats and a variety of birds. Arora would not say how many flights were delayed during the rescue operation. The airport handles 13,000 domestic and 9,500 international passengers a day. ""(The) numbers are speculative as it is difficult to attribute delays to bad weather, strong winds, birds or animals,"" Arora said. In the past, animals on the runway have disrupted flights at the airport -- particularly during the monsoon season, Satyanarayan said. ""The monitor lizards -- they look frightening but they are harmless animals,"" he said. ""But they can grow about three to four feet long. And at the velocity a plane lands, the [lizards] can still cause damage.""","Jackals, monitor lizards and birds descend on runway at New Delhi airport .

"(CNN) -- American driver Robby Gordon won the fourth stage of the Dakar Rally by just one second from Stephane Peterhansel, who extended his overall lead to more than seven minutes in South America on Tuesday. NASCAR star Gordon claimed his first victory of this year's race, and his third overall, as he snatched the quickest time on the shortened 163 kilometer stage from Fiambala in Argentina to Copiapo in Chile. It was cut by 40km as some competitors arrived late following Monday's leg. He clocked one hour, 40 minutes and 21 seconds in his Hummer to head off BMW's Peterhansel, who has won three car titles and six on bikes. The Frenchman now leads Carlos Sainz by seven minutes and 36 seconds, with the former world rally champion finishing fourth behind Qatar's Nasser Al-Attiyah. Defending champion Giniel De Villiers gave Volkswagen with three drivers in the top five, but is still way back in 20th due to his problems on Monday. Gordon was left eight overall, more than an hour off the pace, while his compatriot Mark Miller is fourth in another Volkswagen after placing sixth on Tuesday. ""Today's special stage was perfect for us with a lot of camel grass. It's on this type of terrain that the Hummer is doing great,"" Gordon told the race's official Web site. ""I am glad we managed to recover from yesterday. I got stuck twice yesterday and the engine overheated. We lost one hour. It's sad but the race is still long. We've only had four days of raid so far. A stage victory means nothing to us. It's the final victory we are in for."" In the bikes, defending champion Marc Coma bounced back from losing moer than 40 minutes over the last two days to win the stage. The Spaniard was left in sixth overall, 38 minutes and 50 seconds behind Frenchman Cyril Depres, who was third on the stage also riding a 690cc KTM machine. His compatriot David Casteu, riding a smaller 450cc Sherco machine, was runner-up to retain second overall -- almost nine minutes behind with 10 stages left.","Stephane Peterhansel extends lead in Dakar Rally cars section in his BMW .

"(CNN) -- Researchers announced this week that they've found a new gene, ALS6, which is responsible for about 5 percent of hereditary Lou Gehrig's cases. The discovery of a new gene mutation may allow those with ALS in their family to be tested. It's being called a ""momentous discovery"" by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  Association. Scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital, the University of Massachusetts and Kings College in London found the mutation by doing detailed sequencing of the genes in several families with an inherited form of ALS. The findings are published in the February 27 issue of the journal Science and were partially funded by the ALS Association. ALS, a disease of the nervous system, impairs muscle movement and eventually results in total paralysis. It was brought to national attention in 1939, when famed Yankee baseball player Lou Gehrig's illness was diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Today, the disease is most commonly known by his name. ALS6 is a protein normally found inside a cell's nucleus, but in patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, it is found outside the nucleus and sometimes forms unusual clumps. ALS researchers are unsure why this occurs but believe this finding, combined with a gene they discovered last year, TDP-43, may lead them to a firmer idea of what causes this deadly disease. Both genes help in building and transporting proteins and making sure they're in the right place in cell structure -- a process called RNA processing. Lucie Bruijn, senior vice president of research and development at the ALS Association, likens this process to building an engine: If there are parts missing or placed in the wrong place or in the wrong way, the engine doesn't work right. ""Everything has an exquisite role and has to be in the right place, and any imbalance ... can cause things to go awry,"" Bruijn said. ""It's exciting because what it's starting to tell us now is that we might be starting to get an underlying theme,"" Bruijn said. ""We now have two genes with similar function strengthening the idea that alterations in RNA processing is important in ALS. A completely new direction and also involved in many other neurodegenerative diseases."" She believes this gives researchers ""huge"" potential to develop new therapies. And new therapies are needed. There is no cure and only one treatment for ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that seems to progressively attack the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. These attacks can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, twitching, cramping and thick speech, eventually leading to paralysis. According to the ALS Association, the disease strikes a little more than 5,600 people every year, and about 10 percent of those cases are hereditary. The discovery of this new gene mutation will also allow those with ALS in their family to be tested for another gene (this makes three genes). Bruijn says a test ""will be possible; however, currently, it is not widely accessible"" and ""it would only be used in familial ALS patients.""","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association calls ALS gene discovery ""momentous""

"(CNN) -- Kim Clijsters defeated fellow comeback queen Justine Henin in the final of the Brisbane International on Saturday, saving two match-points and wasting three as she won an epic clash. Henin, playing her first tournament since May 2008, fought back from a set and 4-1 down against her fellow Belgian before losing 6-3 4-6 7-6 (8-6) in almost two and a half hours. However, Henin sustained an injury to her left leg and later confirmed on her Web site that she will miss next week's Sydney Invitational, where she faced a possible second-round clash with Serena Williams, in order to recover in time for the decade's first Grand Slam event, the Australian Open. Clijsters, who made history in September as the first unseeded player to win the U.S. Open in her third event back on the WTA Tour following her own short-lived retirement, took control as she won eight straight games. But fellow former world No. 1 Henin dug deep to level the match and then take a 3-0 lead in the deciding set. The 26-year-old Clijsters battled back to tie it up at 3-3, and then both players squandered potentially match-winning break opportunities to ensure a tie-break. Clijsters raced to a 5-1 lead, helped by her first ace of the match -- coming off a second serve -- but then missed three match-point chances at 6-3. Henin again fought back to level at 6-6 but then her 11th double-fault gave Clijsters the chance to finally close out for victory, her 11th in 23 meeting between the two players. Clijsters clinched her 36th WTA Tour title, leaving Henin stuck on 41. ""What a match!"" Clijsters said. ""I think we set the bar pretty high for ourselves for the rest of the year. Justine played at a really high level for the whole tournament, so congratulations."" Meanwhile, top seed Andy Roddick will play defending champion Radek Stepanek in Sunday's men's final at the Pat Rafter Arena. Roddick came from behind to beat Stepanek's fellow Czech Tomas Berdych in the semifinals on Saturday, with the American winning 1-6 6-3 6-4 despite being broken for the first time in the tournament in his opening service game.

"Suzanne Simons is an executive producer at CNN as well as author of the book ""Master of War: Blackwater USA's Erik Prince and the Business of War"" (Collins, June 2009). Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater, is pictured in Afghanistan in November 2007. (CNN) -- The private military contractor formerly known as Blackwater has held classified contracts with the Central Intelligence Agency for nearly a decade, but an allegation that the contractor was part of a secret CIA program to kill al Qaeda operatives -- if true -- would take the relationship to a whole new level. The CIA hired the private security firm Blackwater USA in 2004 to work on a covert program aimed at targeting and potentially killing top al Qaeda leaders, a source familiar with the program told CNN. Former company executives deny knowing about the program. Current leaders of the company did not return calls to CNN. The CIA won't comment on classified contracts. The classified program, canceled by CIA director Leon Panetta earlier this year, was part of a broader effort inside the CIA to develop the capacity to conduct training, surveillance and possible covert operations overseas, according to the source. The program was outsourced to contractors to ""put some distance"" between the effort and the U.S. government. Other contractors were brought in for other parts of the program, another source said, and Blackwater's involvement ended by mid-2006. But one thing is clear: The company that renamed itself Xe earlier this year in an effort to escape controversy surrounding a 2007 shooting in Baghdad that left 17 Iraqis dead has had a long relationship with the world's most famous spy agency. When Erik Prince first opened his Blackwater training facility in the late '90s, his clients included special forces teams and law enforcement agencies from around the country. Prince had expressed frustration with the training facilities he visited during his time as a Navy SEAL, and a sizable inheritance allowed him the financial freedom to retire from the military and try his hand at creating a better facility. His first clients were indeed SEAL teams. But they also included teams from other government agencies, including the CIA. Case officers and protection details, the people generally accustomed to working in the shadows, began showing up for training on the shooting range or the driving track in a rural part of North Carolina. When then-CIA Executive Director Alvin ""Buzzy"" Krongard, whose own son was a Navy SEAL, visited the facility, former Blackwater President Gary Jackson suggested he meet with Prince, who worked out of an office in the Washington area. The two had lunch and Krongard immediately took a liking to the man who would later lead the world's most notorious private contracting company. At the time, contacts like these were essential to building the business, so when terror struck the heart of America in September 2001, Prince called up his new friend Krongard and offered to help. Sources inside the agency at the time say that Krongard in fact, was pushing hard for Blackwater to be given the first urgent and compelling, no-bid contract to protect CIA facilities in Afghanistan. The military, it seems, wasn't up to the task of staffing such an effort. Once awarded the initial contract, Prince maintained a close relationship with Krongard, and made trips to Afghanistan to make sure things were going smoothly. The idea that the agency came to Blackwater for help on any other contracts, including one with the overall goal of locating and assassinating al Qaeda operatives, wouldn't come as a huge surprise, particularly since so much of the intelligence budget is spent on private contractors. But with investigations under way into just what was done and by whom at the CIA under the Bush administration, people are remaining tight-lipped. Especially under the threat of possible prosecution, should it go that far.","Relationship between Blackwater and CIA goes back almost a decade .

"Washington (CNN) -- Human error and system lapses, rather than deliberate concealing of information, allowed a terror suspect with explosives to board a U.S.-bound airplane on Christmas Day, President Obama's terrorism czar said Sunday. John Brennan, the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the security breakdown in the failed bombing of the Northwest Airlines flight was different from the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. ""It's not like 9/11,"" Brennan said, adding that the ""system didn't work as it should have"" due to ""lapses"" and ""human error."" ""There wasn't an effort to try to conceal information,"" he said, referring to the well-chronicled competition and turf wars among security agencies prior to the 2001 attacks, which was later blamed for the failure to prevent them. ""There is no smoking gun piece of intelligence out there,"" Brennan said of the failed Christmas bombing, allegedly planned by a Nigerian man who boarded the flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, with explosives in his underwear. Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration announced Sunday new security measures to be implemented by domestic and international air carriers on flights bound for the United States, effective Monday. The suspect's father, a leading banker in Nigeria, warned U.S. authorities before the attack that his son might be involved with Islamic extremists. Brennan said the father's information was part of ""bits and pieces"" of information that were never connected by intelligence officials to properly target the suspect. ""That was certainly an alert that came to our attention,"" Brennan said of the father's warnings. ""He said, 'He's consorting with extremists in Yemen.'"" However, Brennan rejected another potential warning sign -- that the suspect purchased the airline ticket with cash in Ghana before traveling to Nigeria for the first leg of his journey. ""A lot of people buy their tickets in Africa with cash. That is the way, in fact, things are done, because there's so much fraud there. So that wasn't a necessary [warning] bell,"" Brennan said. ""People in the Amsterdam airport didn't even know that he had bought the ticket for cash. He did bring on carry-on luggage. So there were a lot of things that were out there."" At the same time, Brennan conceded ""there was information that was in the system that should have allowed us to stop it."" ""A number of pieces were out there that weren't brought together,"" Brennan said. On the same program, however, the Republican chairman of the 9/11 commission said Brennan was ""wrong when he says this wasn't like 9/11."" Thomas Kean, a former governor of New Jersey, said both events occurred because the U.S. intelligence community failed to piece together various bits of information it already possessed in the weeks and months prior to the attacks. If the information had been properly shared and analyzed, ""then this guy would've never have gotten on a plane"" on Christmas Day, Kean said. In announcing the new security measures Sunday, the TSA stressed in a statement that ""effective aviation security must begin beyond our borders."" As a result, any individual flying into the United States who is ""traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening,"" the statement said. ""The directive also increases the use of enhanced screening technologies and mandates threat-based and random screening for passengers on U.S. bound international flights.""","John Brennan: ""System didn't work as it should have"" due to ""lapses"" and ""human error""

"(CNN) -- Major conflict could return to southern parts of Sudan unless international action bolsters a faltering peace accord, ten aid agencies said in a report released Thursday. A resumption of conflict between north and south in Sudan, meanwhile, would make a sustainable peace impossible in Darfur, a region of western Sudan that has been the scene of what the U.S. calls genocide, the aid groups said. ""It is not yet too late to avert disaster, but the next 12 months are a crossroads for Africa's largest country, "" said Maya Mailer, policy advisor for Oxfam International and the report's co-author. The warnings were underscored by news Thursday of a clash that killed scores in Southern Sudan, the latest instance of tribal violence among southerners that has alarmed the United Nations. Locals said fierce fighting in Warap State, one of the most remote regions of the south, killed 140 people, wounded 90, and led to the theft of tens of thousands of cattle early this month or in late December, the United Nations said. ""The human toll is massive -- hundreds if not thousands displaced. The death toll is massive,"" said Lisa Grande, a top U.N. humanitarian official in Southern Sudan. ""These attacks are a matter of great concern."" Resurgent tribal violence in the south also concerned the 10 aid groups. They released their report, ""Rescuing the Peace in Southern Sudan,"" two days before the fifth anniversary of a 2005 peace deal that ended a grinding war between the Sudanese government and southern rebels in the Sudan People's Liberation Movement. They said that peace deal is ""on the brink of collapse."" That war pitted a northern government of Arab Muslims against southern blacks who follow Christianity and traditional African religions. It killed 2 million people and forced several million others from their homes. The peace deal conferred limited autonomy on southern Sudan and ended one of Africa's longest and deadliest wars even as a separate conflict that erupted in 2003 raged in Darfur, killing roughly 200,000, the United Nations says. Despite the peace deal, violence in the south increased last year, Mailer said, and it could escalate further to become one of the biggest emergencies in Africa this year. About 2,500 people were killed and 350,000 fled their homes in southern Sudan last year, the aid agencies said. Many died in tribal violence between southerners. Outside countries have ignored the problem and have not provided sufficient help, the agencies said. The United Nations says more people have been killed in southern Sudan in 2009 than in Darfur, where a separate conflict drew international attention, prompted charges of genocide and led the International Criminal Court to indict the Sudanese president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, for war crimes. Some southerners blame their former enemies in the north for instigating violence in the south. As the south plans to participate in national elections in April, many southerners say the north has hindered access to registration materials, logistical support and voter education, the United Nations said. The north denies those charges, but they're among the reasons that analysts worry about an outbreak of north-south violence in a region already buckling under the weight of corruption, cattle rustling and revenge attacks. Sudan needs diplomatic involvement from neighboring countries and the international community to help secure the 2005 peace agreement, said Paul Valentin, international director of Christian Aid, one of the agencies that produced the report. ""A return to war is by no means inevitable, but it depends whether the world heeds the warning signs of the past year and has the political will to save the peace,"" Valentin added. Other agencies that produced the report include the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and World Vision. The report urges the U.N. Security Council to ensure that protecting civilians becomes a core priority for a peacekeeping force in Sudan. The agencies also called on the international community to mediate between the northern and southern parties before the national elections -- the country's first multi-party elections in 24 years -- and before a referendum on independence, which is scheduled for early next year. Southern Sudan is roughly the size of Texas but has only 30 miles of paved roads and few health facilities. It is so underdeveloped that the U.N. says a 15-year-old girl in the south is more likely to die in childbirth than finish school. ""After five years of peace, southern Sudan remains one of the poorest regions on earth. People hoped the peace would bring economic benefits and development, but this has happened far too slowly and in some areas not at all,"" said Francisco Roque, country director of Save the Children in South Sudan. ""We are very worried about children who seem to be increasingly targeted in attacks on villages,"" he said. ""International donors and the government must urgently improve aid to these areas.""","Aid groups: Peace deal signed in 2005 ""on the brink of collapse""

"(CNN) -- Any kid can dream up a roller coaster. But those who visit a new exhibit at Walt Disney World's Epcot theme park can actually take a ride on their fantasy creations. An artist's rendering of the ""Sum of All Thrills"" interactive ride, opening Wednesday at Disney World. Epcot on Wednesday opened a new attraction called ""Sum of All Thrills,"" which lets kids use computer tablets to design a virtual roller coaster, bobsled track or plane ride. After inputting their designs, kids climb into a robotic carriage that uses virtual-reality technology to help them experience the ride they've created. ""This is really the next generation -- where there's a lot more personalization involved"" in the amusement-park experience, said Eric Goodman, Disney's lead project manager on the ride. This make-your-own-ride approach appears to be a growing trend in the world of amusement parks and museums. Taking cues from the video game industry, park and ride designers have realized that people -- especially young ones -- want to interact with and even design their own thrill rides. In addition to the new Epcot ride in Orlando, Florida, two Disney theme parks feature a ride called ""Toy Story Mania,"" which lets riders shoot at targets as they roll down the track and, in doing so, shape their own ride experience. Another Disney attraction, CyberSpace Mountain, caters to adults and kids by letting them customize their own virtual ride from a menu of drops, loops and other features. Universal Studios in Florida opened a roller coaster in August called the ""Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit,"" which lets people create their own personal musical soundtrack for their ride. Interactive rides are in the ""baby stages"" so far, since roller coasters and theme-park attractions are so expensive to build, but interaction and personalization promise to be running themes in the industry, said Bob McTyre, president of Apogee Attractions, which has has helped design rides for Disney, Universal Studios and others. McTyre was not involved in the new ride at Epcot. He said theme park designers frequently bring up ideas such as roller coasters with three possible endings, allowing riders to choose which path to take. But those big ideas quickly hit a roadblock: the high costs of implementing such a project, he said. Shawn McCoy, vice-president of marketing and business development at Jack Rouse Associates, another amusement-park design firm, said this desire for interactivity in amusement parks takes its cues from video games. ""There's also a definite need to compete with video games or the gaming industry -- where [players] have control over all of the elements, from the environment to the players' movement,"" he said, noting that museums and zoos also are taking notice of the trend. The ""Sum of All Thrills"" ride at Epcot employs a robotic arm -- more commonly seen assembling cars at an auto plant -- to let kids experience their roller coaster creations. Sitting in a carriage with their legs and arms outside the ride, kids watch a video version of their ride while the arm moves them from side to side and up and down to simulate the feeling of a real roller coaster. Fans blow air at the riders at various speeds to give people the sensation that they're moving forward. Goodman, the Disney designer, said the robotic arm and carriage come ""pretty darn close"" to replicating the real roller coaster experience. Kids design their experience on touch-screen computers, using a digital ruler and pre-selected track options to construct their rides. If a person tries to build something physically impossible -- a hill that's too steep for the cars to climb, for example -- then they're asked to retool their ideas. Disney hopes the interactive nature of the Epcot ride also helps kids learn that math and science can be fun. ""I think it's really empowering for the kids to realize that the math doesn't control them. They get to control the math,"" Goodman said. The Raytheon Company, a maker of weapons and defense systems, said it sponsored the exhibit as a way to get middle-school aged kids more interested in careers in math and engineering.","Disney opens an exhibit where kids create roller coasters -- and ride them .

"BALTIMORE, Maryland (CNN) -- Dr. Carnell Cooper, a Baltimore surgeon, is saving lives inside and outside the operating room. Dr. Carnell Cooper's Violence Intervention Program provides training and support to trauma victims. Since becoming a trauma surgeon 16 years ago, he has dedicated himself to treating the many young African-American men who've been shot, stabbed or beaten, only to see them return to the ER with another severe injury just months later. But when one of his patients was readmitted with a fatal gunshot wound to the head in 1996, it changed Cooper's life. ""The night that we pronounced that young man dead and my colleagues said there's really nothing we can do in these situations. ... I just didn't believe that,"" said Cooper, 54. ""From that day forward, I said, 'Let's see what we can do.' "" Cooper created the Violence Intervention Program (VIP) at the Shock Trauma Unit of the University of Maryland Medical Center, the state's busiest hospital for violent injuries. It became one of the country's first hospital-based anti-violence programs. ""We approached this problem like any public health crisis, like heart disease or smoking,"" he said. ""We tried to work on the root causes."" Since 1998, VIP has provided substance abuse counseling, job skills training and other support services to nearly 500 trauma victims. ""Using that scalpel blade to save their life is the first step,"" Cooper said. ""The next step is to try to keep them from coming back."" A 2006 study by Cooper and his colleagues, published in the Journal of Trauma, showed that people in the program were six times less likely to be readmitted with a violent injury and three times less likely to be arrested for a violent crime. The issue hits close to home for Cooper. Born to unwed teenagers in Dillon, South Carolina, he grew up in a neighborhood where violent crime was commonplace; he had friends and relatives who ended up dead or in jail. But his grandparents made sure he stayed on the right path. As a straight-A student, he attended a prestigious high school in Massachusetts, then Yale University and Duke University School of Medicine. But while Cooper rose above his circumstances, he felt sympathy for the young men who rotated in and out of his operating room. ""They could be my friends, my family,"" he said. Cooper's program attempts to help patients from the moment they arrive because victims of violence face a greater risk of receiving another violent injury. Everyone treated for violent wounds at the hospital is seen by a VIP case worker, often at bedside. For Cooper, approaching patients at this early stage is crucial. ""We may get them in a moment when they are thinking, 'I just almost died,' "" he said. ""We say, 'We're going help you find a way to get out of the game.' ""  Watch Cooper talk to a victim of violence at his bedside Â» . VIP helps connect its members with additional support services, such as GED classes, conflict resolution, mentoring and parenting skills. A peer support group also meets at the hospital once a week. The success of Cooper's program has made it a model for others around the country and inspired the doctor to develop a larger initiative, the Violence Prevention Program, which includes other hospital-based efforts targeting young people in at-risk communities. Howard McCray, 29, turned his life around with help from VIP. He joined the program in 2001 after he was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the arm. Nicknamed ""Pooh"" for his resemblance to Winnie the Pooh, McCray's demeanor and lifestyle were once vastly different from the storybook bear's.

"Washington (CNN) -- Washington police were investigating on Sunday whether an off-duty officer drew his gun in the midst of a snowball fight involving a couple hundred people. The Metropolitan Police Department said video from a local media outlet at the scene Saturday did not show the officer with his weapon drawn. However, authorities have since received ""additional images and statements that would seem to support the allegation that the off-duty member did pull a gun,"" a police statement said. About 200 people from a D.C. neighborhood had gathered Saturday to brave a snowstorm for a massive snowball fight, CNN affiliate WJLA reported. ""It was pretty fun,"" one unidentified participant told WJLA. ""And then, you know, when the gun came out, uh, it just changed the tone of the thing a little bit."" The off-duty, plainclothes officer was driving in the area of the snowball fight when several snowballs hit his vehicle, police said. The officer exited the vehicle and yelled at the crowd, WJLA reported; witnesses accused that officer of drawing his gun. A uniformed police officer who subsequently arrived was holding a gun at his hip, but he eventually returned it to his holster, video from WJLA shows. MPD Assistant Chief Peter Newsham said the uniformed officer was responding to a  911 call that someone -- apparently the plainclothes officer -- had a gun, according to WJLA. The uniformed officer holstered his weapon when he recognized the plainclothes officer, Newsham said, according to WJLA.

"(CNN)  -- Fort Hood, Texas, is -- for all intents and purposes -- a city. With as many as 30,000 residents, it has all the trappings of an American metropolis: malls, softball fields, subdivisions and as many as nine schools. But in other ways, Fort Hood is like no American city. It is a transition point for troops who have served overseas, soldiers who have seen the worst that war has to offer and are returning to life at home. At least 13 people were killed and 30 wounded in shootings on the post Thursday, officials said. The alleged gunman, identified as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, 39, was wounded. Some of those killed or wounded were at the Readiness Center, a soldier's last stop before deployment, said Army Lt. Gen. Bob Cone. It is also one of the first places a soldier goes after returning from war. Officials: Gunman opens fire at Fort Hood . Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who served at Fort Hood in the late 1990s, said the nearly eight years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq have created difficulties for the U.S. armed forces. ""This is a very complex situation, a situation we have not dealt with in the Army before. We have never been at war this long before in modern history,"" he said. ""And many of these soldiers have been deployed multiple times, so this has put a lot of stress on these soldiers and their families. ""One of the biggest things on re-entry that the Readiness Center does is to help those soldiers cope with being back home and dealing with the extremes of [post-traumatic stress disorder],"" Honore said. It is also where soldiers ""do everything from finalizing your next of kin, inspect your immunization record, as well as make a will,"" he said. Fort Hood is the largest U.S. military installation in the world by size, and on any given day, it is home to 25,000 to 30,000 people, according to an Army spokesman at the Pentagon. The post also houses the families of service members and other civilians. iReport.com: Are you there? Send pics, video . ""Some of these soldiers have lost some of their closest friends, seen some of the horrific things associated with warfare including these roadside bombs,"" Honore said. ""They've seen and experienced -- many of them -- some very horrific events."" Services and programs offered on the post range from helping troops who are leaving the armed services find employment or pursue education to helping soldiers deal with combat-related illnesses like post-traumatic stress disorder. One such program, called the Warrior Stress Reset Program, is ""designed to help address those common and normal reactions to war experiences,"" says a military Web site. ""It is well documented that participation in a major conflict ... has a way of leaving its mark on the psyche of our soldiers,"" the Web site reads. The program lasts three weeks and provides counseling and treatment. U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said the post has a robust support system for families of deployed troops, which would help troops and civilians there handle Thursday's violence. ""The people who are there will surround the families and take care of them, the ones who have had loved ones who were killed,"" she said. The Army's 1st Cavalry Division and elements of the 4th Infantry Division, as well as the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 13th Corps Support Command, are based at Fort Hood. Fort Hood measures about 340 square miles across and is approximately 160 miles south of Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas.

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Drumsticks in hand, Derrick Tabb has found a way to transform New Orleans children from troublemakers to tuba players. Derrick Tabb's program provides free tutoring, instruments and music instruction to more than 100 students. Tabb, wearing a gold chain and a baseball cap, doesn't look the part of a typical band teacher. But every weekday evening in the French Quarter, he beats out the rhythm on his music stand as students play their chosen instruments. In doing so, he gives them an alternative to New Orleans' rough streets. ""I tell everyone I'm competing with the drug dealers,"" said Tabb, 34. His program, The Roots of Music, offers free tutoring, instruments and music education to more than 100 students. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . Reformed class clown Terrence Knockum credits Tabb with changing his life. The 15-year-old tuba player joined the band eight months ago, when he was failing in school and ""heading up the wrong road,"" said Tabb. Today, Knockum is the band captain. He hopes to make music his career and teach it himself one day. ""Before, I was getting in trouble,"" Knockum said. ""Now ... when I come here, I'm learning how to play the horn, be disciplined and, you know, just work hard."" Tabb can relate. During a rebellious phase in junior high, his band teacher became his mentor and helped him get back on track. ""He saved my life,"" recalled Tabb, a professional drummer with the Rebirth Brass Band, one of the city's most popular acts. Now Tabb, a New Orleans native, strives to keep young people on the straight and narrow in the city with the nation's highest murder rate, according to FBI statistics. ""When all you've seen is the drug dealers and the killing, you know, they think that's cool,"" said Tabb, adding that many young people wind up in trouble because they have nothing else to do. The type of music support systems that helped Tabb years ago have been struggling since Hurricane Katrina; musicians scattered after the storm and budget cuts ended many school music programs. As a result, Tabb chose to target 9- to 14-year-olds with his program. ""That's just the most vulnerable time of your life,"" he said. ""If I catch them now, I can hold onto them for at least four or five years and guide them the way that we want to guide them."" Students meet from 4-7 p.m. every weekday, year-round. They work with tutors on schoolwork, practice their music and eat a hot meal before heading home. Through funding from donations and sponsors, Tabb's group is able to provide bus transportation, instruments and food for free. He calls it his ""no excuse"" policy -- ""you don't have no excuse why you're not here,"" Tabb said. With a 90 percent attendance rate, his formula seems to be working.  Watch Tabb and The Roots of Music program in action Â» . Tabb attributes the success in part to the nature of music. ""You're constantly learning something new,"" he said. ""That's what keeps the kids coming back every day."" Since getting underway last year, The Roots of Music has already exceeded Tabb's expectations. The band marched in five Mardi Gras parades this season. The program also helped students improve their academic performances, with 85 percent having raised their grades in at least one class; some D and F students have become A students. And there are more than 400 children on the waiting list. Tabb said he's assembled a ""dream team"" of musicians to help teach the students, and he personally works with all the beginners. No previous musical experience is necessary -- many students don't even know the names of the instruments when they start -- but youngsters like 9-year-old Lauren Washington, who plays the flute, learn fast. ""It's kind of hard to play, but I sound good,"" she said proudly. ""It's fun!""  Watch Washington and other students demonstrate their talents Â» . But the program isn't only about fun. ""Music is about discipline,"" said Tabb. He insists on good behavior and keeps kids in order with threats of sit-ups, pushups or tasks like picking up grains of rice -- but these measures aren't just punishment. ""We wear them out so they don't have any time or energy to get mixed up in anything on the street,"" he said. Discipline aside, Tabb wants young people to realize that music can help them build a better future. ""I don't say that I'm saving lives,"" he said. ""I say I'm giving life -- a whole different life of music."" Want to get involved?

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama paid tribute Wednesday to those who have lost their lives in the nation's wars as well as to the men and women who currently serve. ""There's no tribute, no commemoration, no praise that can truly match the magnitude of your service and your sacrifice,"" he said in a speech at Arlington National Cemetery on a rainy, overcast Veterans Day. ""We call this a holiday, but for many veterans, it's another day of memories that drive them to live their lives each day as best as they possibly can,"" he said. ""For our troops, it is another day in harm's way. For their families, it is another day to feel the absence of a loved one and the concern for their safety. For our wounded warriors, it is another day of slow recovery. And in this national cemetery, it is another day when grief remains fresh."" He vowed that ""America will do right"" by its troops. ""To all who served in every battle in every war, we say that it's never too late to say thank you."" Earlier Wednesday, the president and first lady Michelle Obama also walked through Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery, CNN's Jill Dougherty reported. The section is where service members from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. There, the Obamas stopped to talked to relatives and friends of those who have died. Skip and Rhonda Rollins of New Hampshire were visiting the gravesite of their son, Justin, who was killed in Iraq in 2007. He would have turned 25 on Tuesday. The couple said they were ""extremely surprised"" to see Obama ""take the time to speak with the families"" in Section 60. Although he said he generally holds different political views from those of the president, Skip Rollins said that supporting American soldiers, both living and dead, ""should always be a nonpartisan issue."" He added, ""It was extremely nice of him to take this time out to come down here and do this."" The couple said they make the trip to their son's grave each year around this time for their son's birthday and for Veterans Day. ""It's not just my son that I mourn for; when I see all the others' stones, the ages of the soldiers, and you know they've given the ultimate sacrifice for all of us. And you know it's hard for me to leave, to leave my son,"" Rhonda Rollins said. Earlier Wednesday, the president laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in the cemetery. He then stood solemnly as a bugle played taps. Some onlookers watched from under umbrellas. Veterans Day comes a day after Obama addressed 15,000 people at a memorial service at Fort Hood Army Post, where 13 people were killed and dozens more were wounded in a shooting last week. The president told the families of those killed that ""no words can fill the void that has been left,"" adding, ""your loved ones endure through the life of our nation."" The suspected gunman in the attack is a 39-year-old Army psychiatrist, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who remains in intensive care at an Army hospital in San Antonio, Texas. Later Wednesday, Obama discussed with his war council scenarios to move forward in Afghanistan. One scenario, a senior administration official and U.S. military official independently confirmed, calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan. Other nations honored those who sacrificed their lives in wars on Wednesday, in many cases for the first time without any surviving veterans of World War I. Services took place around the world to mark the 91st anniversary of the armistice signed between Germany and the Allies on November 11, 1918. Depending on where it is celebrated, the day is known as Armistice Day, Remembrance Day, Poppy Day or Veterans Day. In Britain, Queen Elizabeth led Remembrance Day ceremonies in Westminster Abbey, a service also attended by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and other senior politicians and military leaders. In Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel held a ceremony under the Arc de Triomphe. Australians observed one minute silence at 11 a.m. in memory of those who died or suffered in all of the nation's wars and armed conflicts. ""Their loss is a reminder that there is nothing glorious about war. Those called upon to fight know that better than anyone,"" said Gen. Peter Cosgrove, chairman of the Council of the Australian War Memorial.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The office of a reformist Iranian member of parliament burned Tuesday night, and a reformist Web site said the act was the work of extremists. Mir Hossein Moussavi, an opposition candidate in the disputed June 12 presidential election, blamed the fire at the office of Nasrollah Torabi on plainclothes militia on Moussavi's Facebook Web site, where he also posted photos. The photos showed heavy damage, with charred furniture, peeling wallpaper and floors strewn with broken glass, debris and ashes. Parleman News, a newsgathering organization for the Path of the Imam Khomeini faction of parliament, said the office was vandalized before it was torched. Khomeini was the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. Torabi, who represents the southwestern province of Cahar-Mahal Bakhtiari in parliament, told Parleman News that he was awaiting the outcome of an investigation. The office is in the city of Shahr-e Kurd. Torabi urged people not to react to the incident, according to Parleman News. He said intelligence agencies and the Interior Ministry must investigate the fire and punish those responsible. The lawmaker said that after he gave a speech in parliament criticizing the government, he came under heavy criticism from government supporters, Parleman News said. No date was given for the speech. ""After that speech in the meeting of the Planning Council for Cahar-Mahal Bakhtiari [Province], we witnessed the anger of the province's governor-general,"" Torabi said. Investigators ""must not allow some people to use force, scare tactics and oppression to bring the three principles of independence, freedom and Islamic Republic under question,"" he added, according to Parleman News. Torabi said that after he gave the speech, banners condemning him were distributed throughout Shahr-e Kurd, with the backing of the governor's office. According to Moussavi, Torabi told the news organization: ""In the middle of the night some made their last pathetic attempt and set the office of a representative of the people on fire with the aim of silencing the members of the parliament."" Moussavi called the fire an attempt at intimidation. Opponents of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have held sometimes-violent protests after he was swept into office for a second term despite accusations of election fraud. The latest protest occurred Sunday on the Shiite Muslim holy day of Ashura, which marks the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of Prophet Mohammed, as a martyr. A prosecutor said seven people died, including Moussavi's nephew, in the demonstrations.","Reformist lawmaker Nasrollah Torabi's office burned Tuesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- With a simple, declarative statement, the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs announced his ambitious goal to eradicate one of the country's most shameful problems. ""My name is Shinseki, and I am here to end veteran homelessness,"" VA Secretary Eric Shinseki said Tuesday in a speech to the National Summit on Homeless Veterans. But Shinseki indicated the challenge in meeting his goal by adding, ""I learned long ago there are never any absolutes in life, and a goal of zero homeless veterans sure sounds like an absolute."" The plan unveiled by Shinseki includes trying to leverage existing education and jobs programs, boosting the ability of veteran-owned businesses to compete for federal contracts and spend an additional $3 billion on medical services and homeless programs. An estimated 131,000 veterans are homeless, according to the VA. That is an improvement from 2003, when the number was as high as 196,000. But the secretary warned that given the ailing economy, the number could increase by as much as 10 percent to 15 percent in the next five years. The VA plans to focus its new efforts on preventing the problem. ""Our plan enlarges the scope of VA's efforts to combat homelessness,"" said Shinseki in a news release. ""In the past, VA focused largely on getting homeless veterans off the streets. Our five-year plan aims also at preventing them from ever ending up homeless."" The department plans to expand the recently passed educational grants program for veterans who served after September 11, 2001, to include not just college but vocational programs as well, according to VA spokeswoman Katie Roberts. ""Not every veteran wants to spend four years pursuing a college degree, but they might be interested in learning a trade that would get them into the taxpaying work force sooner,"" Shinseki said. The VA will also try to win more federal contracts for veteran-owned businesses, encouraging other agencies to exceed the minimum goal of 3 percent of contracts to veteran-owned small businesses. The increase, the VA believes, will also help employ more veterans since ""veterans hire veterans,"" Shinseki said. In addition, it is increasing the amount of vouchers for public-financed housing, adding 10,000 more vouchers in 2010. The plan also calls for more programs to aid transition from prison and psychiatric facilities, as well as a renewed call to treat veterans' psychiatric conditions. Read more about the VA's ambitious goal . Veterans' groups contacted after the speech were generally pleased that the secretary was focusing the attention but unsure how he would achieve such an ambitious goal. ""General Shinseki is a soldier and treating this like a military operation and in the military you have to have hope for your missions,"" said Justin Brown of Veterans of Foreign Wars. Shinseki was a four-star general in the Army. Brown said he thought Shinseki's aim to get better coordination between the VA and federal departments, including Labor and Health, was a good start. But others were more pessimistic that Shinseki could change the VA bureaucracy. ""This secretary is going to be a good leader, but we don't think he or the president has quite gotten a hold of how intractable the bureaucracy is inside the VA,"" said Rick Weidman, executive director for policy and government affairs at Vietnam Veterans of America. Weidman said one problem not mentioned Tuesday that would help, more than many of of the other programs, is reducing the backlog in processing veterans' claims that delays much-needed medical and other benefits. The VA recognizes backlogs are a problem, said spokeswoman Roberts. ""The backlog is a top priority at the VA and at the forefront of the secretary's mind,"" she said. Toni Reinis at the Los Angeles organization New Directions said the announcement Tuesday showed that Shinseki had ""real leadership,"" but she worried that lack of funds and leadership at the local level would make instituting change difficult. The problem, she said, is sometimes not in the VA's control. Reinis said her group's center, which helps 700 homeless veterans a year gain employment, housing and proper medical and psychiatric care in a residential setting, has lost a lot of money because of state budget cuts. The county cut the center's mental health funding by 55 percent, which is a ""significant"" amount, Reinis said. Efforts to expand have been met with opposition, as in the case of a seven-year effort in California's San Fernando Valley to build a new treatment center that has been opposed by local communities. ""The VA was behind it, but the neighbors don't want those people in their neighborhood,"" Reinis explained.","VA Secretary Eric Shinseki says, ""I am here to end veteran homelessness""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Taliban in Pakistan have released a second audiotape purportedly containing the voice of their leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, who sources say was wounded in a suspected drone strike this week. The group also released an audiotape Friday, though CNN could not confirm that the voice on either tape belongs to Mehsud. It was unclear whether the first tape was recorded before or after Thursday's drone strike, but the voice on the second tape announced the date as Saturday. ""Let me say this briefly, that I, Hakimullah Mehsud, today, on the 16th of January, with central spokesman Azam Tariq and Umar Khittab, want to give this message to all mujahedeen: that by the grace of Allah, I, Hakimullah Mehsud, am alive and in good health. Neither have I been martyred in a drone attack nor injured,"" the voice says on Saturday's tape. Tariq, a Taliban spokesman, denied Thursday and again Friday that Mehsud was hurt. Tariq said Mehsud had left the site of the attack -- a converted religious school -- before the missiles struck. He dismissed reports of an injury to Mehsud as propaganda. However, other Taliban and intelligence sources said doctors were treating Mehsud for wounds he sustained in the drone strike. Tariq delivered both audiotapes to local journalists. On the tape released Friday, the voice says, ""The media right now is also part of the war. The enemy through the media wants to demoralize the Taliban. At times they spread the propaganda in the media that 'We have martyred Hakimullah.' At other times they say, 'We have completed the operation in South Waziristan,' but this will never happen."" The drone strike hit a madrassa, or religious school, that local officials said had been converted into a militant training camp. Ten people were killed in the strike, Pakistani intelligence and local officials said. In the Friday tape, the speaker warns of what will happen if the drone strikes continue. ""I want to inform the Pakistani people that the drone attacks that take place in the tribal areas endanger the politics, well-being and sovereignty of Pakistan,"" the speaker says. ""From today onward, for any dangerous step that the Pakistani Taliban will take in Pakistan, those responsible will be Pakistan's rulers, not the Taliban. This is because the Pakistani rulers want to spill the blood of the innocent [tribesmen] in exchange for dollars."" The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones, or unmanned aircraft. The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Last week, the Taliban released a video showing Mehsud sitting next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, the man who killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian army captain at an eastern Afghan base December 30. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. It was carried out out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid. Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe, but not from the same family.

The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said the soldier was found close to where he disappeared November 4. Officials are continuing their search for a second paratrooper lost at the same time. Both men -- from the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division -- disappeared in the Morghab River near Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan. The men were on a routine resupply mission, the NATO group said. Family members identified the recovered body as that of Benjamin Sherman, 21, of Plymouth, Massachusetts. They said he jumped into the river when he saw a fellow soldier struggling in the water.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Dozens of suspected terrorists released by the United States from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are believed to have returned to terrorism activities, according to the Pentagon. Pentagon officials say 61 former Gitmo detainees have committed or are suspected of returning to terrorism. Since 2002, 61 former detainees have committed or are suspected to have committed attacks after being released from the detention camp, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said at a briefing Tuesday. The number is up since the Pentagon's last report in March 2008 when officials said 37 former detainees had been suspected of returning to the battlefield since 2002. Since 2007, more than 100 detainees were released, significantly more than in previous years, according to Pentagon officials. According to the statistics, of the 61 former detainees that are believed to have returned to fighting, 18 have been officially confirmed while 43 are suspected, Morrell said. The 18 were confirmed through intelligence, photographs, fingerprints and other information, Morrell said. Of the 43 other detainees suspected of taking part in terrorist attacks, only ""plausible reporting"" on their activities indicated some kind of involvement, according to Morrell. Officials would only identify one of the confirmed attackers, Adballah Salih al-Ajmi, a Kuwaiti man released from U.S. custody at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in 2005. Pentagon officials said Salih al-Ajmi blew himself up in a suicide attack in Iraq in April 2008. Since 2002, the Pentagon has released about 520 detainees to their home countries or counties that agreed to take them. Some have been released in full by those countries while others are still being held. ""There, clearly, are people who are being held at Guantanamo who are still bent on doing harm to America, Americans and our allies, so there will have to be some solution for the likes of them,"" Morrell said. About 250 detainees remain held at Guantanamo and about 60 of those detainees have been cleared for release by the Pentagon, but their home countries will not take them or the U.S. believes they could be harmed by their governments if returned. President-elect Barack Obama has said he intends to shut down Guantanamo. Earlier this week, two sources close to the Obama transition team said he could issue an order to do so as early as his first week in office, saying that Obama believes ""the legal framework at Gitmo has failed to successfully and swiftly prosecute terrorists.""","61 former Gitmo detainees still involved in terror acts, according to Pentagon .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An attack in which the Taliban claimed to have infiltrated key government sites in downtown Kabul killed at least five people Monday morning, hospital and government officials said. Among the five were two policemen and one national security staff member, Interior Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar said at a news conference. Seventy-one others were injured, 36 of whom were police or security officers, he said. His report of the death toll conflicts with those of Defense Ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi, who said 13 died, and the Taliban, which claimed even more were slain. Seven attackers' bodies were recovered, with two or three of them burned beyond recognition, Azimi said. The Taliban said only five were killed. Four explosions and gunfire shook downtown Kabul about 9:15 a.m. Monday, with the Taliban saying it was conducting a militant operation. The attack started as 14 members of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's Cabinet were to be sworn in, said Parliament member Fawzia Koofi. About 20 Taliban insurgents entered the presidential palace; the ministries of Finance, Mines and Justice; and the Serena Hotel, said spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid. NATO-led forces said ""several small explosions"" and gunfire were reported near the Feroshgah e Afghan Shopping Center and the Serena Hotel, and later added that ""numerous"" suicide bombers had attacked government buildings close to the presidential palace and the Ministry of Justice. Atmar said that the coordinated attacks struck the city over a span of two hours and 45 minutes and that they targeted civilians. And the threat continued at 1 p.m., when three attackers took over Bayman Hotel, Atmar said. More than two hours later, Afghan security forces killed the men, he said. At least two insurgents were killed at the shopping center, NATO-led forces said in a news release, which also said that Afghan national police had secured all roads in the area. A separate news release condemned the attack, which NATO-led forces said took place amid many civilians. Atmar, the Minister of Defense and chief of the National Security Department also condemned the violence. The Taliban claimed that they killed 31 officials and injured 31 people. Their account could not be immediately independently verified. The terrorist group also disputed the government on the number of its militants killed. Five militants had died and 13 had returned to their safe houses, the Taliban's Mujahid said, adding that two were still fighting. But Zmaray Bashari, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said security forces had restored Kabul to normalcy by Monday afternoon.

"(CNN) -- A woman who was beheaded near Buffalo, New York -- allegedly by her husband -- may have been on the phone with her sister when she was killed. Muzzammil Hassan has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of his wife, Aasiya Zubair Hassan. Asma Firfirey of suburban Cape Town, South Africa, told the Afrikaans newspaper Die Burger that she was on the phone with her sister, Aasiya Zubair Hassan, last week when she heard Hassan tell her husband to calm down. She said she heard Hassan say the two could talk about their impending divorce the following day. Then she heard something that sounded like her sister struggling to breathe, she said. ""I can only imagine how scared and emotional she must have been before she died,"" Firfirey said in the interview, reported in English by South Africa's News 24. Police have charged Hassan's husband, Muzzammil Hassan, with second-degree, or intentional, murder in the death of his wife, according to the Erie County District Attorney's Office. Her decapitated body was found at the offices of Bridges TV, the television network where Muzzammil Hassan was chief executive officer and Aasiya Hassan was general manager. Hassan told Orchard Park police his wife was dead, led officers to her body and was arrested Thursday, said Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita III. He is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. Orchard Park Police Chief Andrew Benz on Tuesday contradicted a CNN report that quoted him as saying Hassan confessed to the crime. A Buffalo attorney told CNN on Tuesday that he expects to represent Hassan but declined further comment, saying details had not yet been worked out. Hassan came to America from Pakistan 25 years ago and became a successful banker, but he and his wife were troubled by the negative perception of Muslims, Voice of America reported in 2004. Speaking in December 2004, Hassan said his wife, then pregnant, was worried about that perception and ""felt there should be an American Muslim media where her kids could grow up feeling really strong about their identity as an American Muslim."" ""So she came up with the idea and turned to me and said, 'Why don't you do it?' "" he said. ""And I was like, I have no clue about television. I'm a banker. ... And her comment was, 'You have an MBA. Why don't you write a business plan?' "" Bridges TV began as a television network for Muslim-Americans, aimed at overcoming the negative stereotypes associated with the religion. ""There should be a Muslim media,"" Muzzammil Hassan told VOA, ""so that Muslim children growing up in America grow up with the self-confidence and high self-esteem about their identity both as Americans and as Muslims."" In the past few years, according to a former employee who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, Bridges TV transformed itself into more of a cross-cultural network seeking to bridge the gap between all cultures. Most of their employees were not Muslim, the former employee said, and Muzzammil Hassan himself was not devout. Aasiya Hassan filed for divorce February 6, police said, and Muzzammil Hassan was served with divorce papers at the station. That night, he showed up at the couple's home, she notified authorities and he was served with a restraining order. Police are not commenting on details of the crime, except to say the woman's body did not appear to have been moved. They also would not divulge what Muzzammil Hassan told police or the suspected motive. The law firm representing Aasiya Hassan refused to comment, only confirming that she had filed for divorce. Benz told CNN on Tuesday that police had responded to several domestic violence calls at the couple's address, but no one was arrested. Firfirey, as well as a Pakistani woman identifying herself as another of Aasiya Hassan's sisters, characterized her as living in fear. Firfirey said the last time she saw her sister was in May 2008, when she visited South Africa. When she arrived, she was badly injured, and Firfirey's family paid the equivalent of about $3,000 for her to be treated, she said. Aasiya Hassan returned to America, she said, because she wanted to complete her MBA degree and ""didn't want to leave her children with that monster."" She said she calls Muzzammil Hassan ""the fat man with evil eyes."" Aasiya Hassan would have graduated March 6, Firfirey said. A woman in Pakistan using the name Salma Zubair posted on a blog that she is the sister of ""this brutally murdered woman."" ""She lived her 8 years of married life with fear in heart,"" Zubair wrote. ""He had already frightened her enough that she couldn't muster up her guts and leave him, and when she finally did gather that much strength he killed her so brutally. She lived to protect her children from this man and his family and she died doing so."" She said Aasiya Hassan ""had always been a very loving person, not even one person in this world can say a small wrong word about her ... she had always dreamed a life of a happily married family, which she did her best to achieve."" Both women said they were worried about the couple's children, ages 4 and 6. Firfirey said they were being cared for by a colleague of the couple. Muzzammil Hassan also has two older children from a previous marriage. Members of Muzzammil Hassan's family did not return calls from CNN on Monday. The former employee told CNN that Aasiya Hassan was popular at the station and was very kind. Muzzammil Hassan was known among employees for having a temper -- he sometimes would yell at and demean his wife, but at other times appeared to be a loving husband and father, the former employee said. Bridges TV released a statement Monday saying its staff was ""deeply shocked and saddened by the murder of Aasiya Hassan and the subsequent arrest of Muzzammil Hassan. Our deepest condolences and prayers go out to the families of the victim."" Imam Mohamed Hagmagid Ali, vice president of the Islamic Society of North America, said Aasiya Hassan's death serves ""as a wake-up call to call of us, that violence against women is real and cannot be ignored ... the Muslim community is not exempt from this issue. We, the Muslim community, need to take a strong stand against domestic violence.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Ibrahim Hooper knows the drill. When news first broke Thursday that a shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, killed and injured U.S. soldiers, the national communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations wrote a statement of condemnation. He only sent it out later, when reports emerged that the alleged shooter's name was Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan. ""As soon as we saw what appeared to be a Muslim name, we issued our statement,"" Hooper said. ""Until that time, we were praying that no Muslim would be involved."" That's the reality of crisis management for the Muslim-American community, said Hooper, who handles communications for the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group. Even without confirmation that the alleged gunman was Muslim -- there was no immediate determination of any religious affiliation for Hasan -- the mere reporting of a possible Muslim name required an immediate comment, he said. ""That's unfortunately the world we live in nowadays,"" Hooper said. ""So often, Muslims are accused of not condemning these kind of acts."" The CAIR statement said: ""No political or religious ideology could ever justify or excuse such wanton and indiscriminate violence. The attack was particularly heinous in that it targeted the all-volunteer Army that protects our nation. American Muslims stand with our fellow citizens in offering both prayers for the victims and sincere condolences to the families of those killed or injured."" In a separate statement, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, based in Los Angeles, California, condemned what it called the ""heinous incident."" ""We are in contact with law enforcement and U.S. federal government officials to gain more facts from this tragic incident and work together in dealing with its aftermath,"" the group said. Its statement called on ""all members of American Muslim communities to be in contact with local law enforcement for the safety and security of their communities and their institutions."" The Islamic Information Center also issued a statement ""in conjunction with all the major Muslim organizations nationwide"" that condemned the attack. ""While several news reports have cited one of the gunmen to be Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, IIC strongly emphasizes that this attack and its perpetrator are in no way representative of the Muslim people or the peace-loving religion of Islam,"" the statement said. ""The individuals who perpetrated this attack blatantly acted against the teachings of Islam and humanity,"" it added. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, Muslim-Americans reported increased attacks and threats by revenge-minded non-Muslims. ""We've seen this before,"" Hooper said of a possible backlash. ""Whenever there's an incident of this type, there's always the possibility this will happen."" Even non-Muslims could be targeted, he said, noting that Sikhs who wear turbans or Hispanic-Americans can be mistaken as being of Middle Eastern descent. On Thursday night, CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad told a news conference the alleged Fort Hood attacker's motive remained unknown. ""We urge all Americans to remain calm in reaction to this tragic event and to demonstrate once again what is best about America -- our nation's ability to remain unified even in times of crisis,"" Awad said. ""We urge national political and religious leaders and media professionals to set a tone of calm and unity. ""Unfortunately, based on past experience, we also urge American Muslims, and those who may be perceived to be Muslim, to take appropriate precautions to protect themselves, their families and their religious institutions from possible backlash.""","Slain Maj.

"(CNN)  -- Rangers kept their stranglehold on the Scottish title as a Lee McCulloch equalizer earned them a 1-1 draw against closest rivals Celtic in the Old Firm derby on Sunday. It leaves the defending champions seven points clear of Celtic, having played a game more, with the season at the halfway point. Ranger manager Walter Smith admitted his team had been fortunate to escape with a point at Parkhead with Celtic wasting a string of chances before Scott McDonald came off the substitutes' bench to head a 79th minute opener. The Australian international converted from an Aidan McGeedy cross, but two minutes later saw McCulloch rise superbly from a corner to earn his side a valuable point. Rangers have 44 points from 19 games and Celtic 37 from 18, but Celtic manager Tony Mowbray remained optimistic, saying that their city neighbors had denied them the title last term after coming from seven points behind. ""Undoubtedly, it's less of a task than they had last year,"" he told reporters. The other game on a crucial Sunday in the championship race saw Hibernian and Hearts draw 1-1 in a bad-tempered Edinburgh derby which saw both teams end with 10 men and crowd trouble. Gordon Smith gave Hearts the lead on the stroke of halftime but one of their fans was ejected after a flare was thrown as the players left the field at the interval. Anthony Stokes leveled for the home side in the 54th minute, but three minutes later Ruben Palazuelos of Hearts and Hibernian's Darren McCormack were shown red for head-butting each other. Hibernian stay third with 33 points and Hearts are fifth.","Rangers and Celtic draw 1-1 in the Old Firm derby in Scotland .

"(CNN) -- A snowstorm that could last up to 18 hours was on its way to southern New England, and Boston, Massachusetts, could be snowed under with up to 15 inches, the National Weather Service said Sunday afternoon. A snowstorm is threatening parts of the Northeast with as much as 15 inches of snowfall. Monday's commuters in the region could face a nightmare with blowing and drifting snow, freezing temperatures, gusty winds and periods of sleet. Flight delays and cancellations were likely, the weather service said. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino declared a snow emergency starting 10 p.m. Sunday in anticipation of the storm, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Boston public schools will be canceled on Monday. At 2:15 a.m. Monday, light snow was starting to fall, WCVB reported. Winter storm warnings straddled Interstate 95 from Maine to the Carolinas, and they also were issued in parts of Georgia and Alabama. Delta Air Lines canceled 300 flights, most of them to or from Atlanta, because of snowy weather, spokesman Brian Kruse said Sunday. It was snowing in Atlanta, where Delta is based, and 2 to 4 inches was expected. David Spear, a spokesman for the Georgia Department of Transportation, expected traffic chaos. ""People tend to get a little animated out here at the sight of snow,"" he told CNN. ""Our concern is going to be -- as we move into the evening hours and the temperature drops -- that that slush becomes ice and then we have a real situation for our morning commute tomorrow."" He said about 200 DOT trucks were deployed to help make roads safe for motorists. In northern Connecticut, southern New Hampshire and most of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, a winter storm warning was to be in effect from 9 p.m. Sunday to 5 p.m. Monday, the weather service said. Such a warning is issued when winter weather conditions are expected to make travel dangerous. As the storm continued its northward trek late Sunday, Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in South Carolina was closed at 9 p.m. for snow removal from runways, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Farther north, Richmond International Airport in Virginia was closed at 10:45 p.m. for the same reason, the FAA said. Both airports were expected to reopen before midnight. The heaviest snow, up to 15 inches, was forecast for the heavily populated I-95 corridor between Boston, Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island, northeast Connecticut and north into the Merrimack Valley in northeast Massachusetts, the weather service said. As much as 3 inches per hour could fall between 10 p.m. Sunday and 10 a.m. Monday. In Washington, Mayor Adrian Fenty declared a snow emergency Sunday afternoon, meaning any street designated as ""snow emergency route"" by signs would be cleared of any parked vehicles, towed if necessary, so snow plows could work unimpeded.  Watch report on the storm system Â» . ""It is important that our crews have access to the roads from curb-to-curb in order to plow the snow,"" said Fenty, whose city was expected to get up to 8 inches of accumulation Sunday night and early Monday with accumulations up to 10 inches by Monday night. ""This is one of the first plow events we have had this season, and we want to ensure we are able to maintain clear and safe roadways as we move into Monday morning,"" Fenty said. Forecasters said as many as 14 inches of snow could pile up in Philadelphia and New York City, starting Sunday night. Lesser amounts of snow were reported as far south as Alabama, although Charlotte, North Carolina, could see up to 8 inches.  Watch snowfall in Georgia Â» . In Memphis, Tennessee, CNN iReporter George Brown said Sunday that forecasters had predicted ""Teflon snow,"" which wouldn't stick to the ground. But the snow that fell was much heavier, he said. iReport.com: Share photos of icy, snowy weather in your town . ""We were getting an inch or more an hour,"" he said. ""Some roads are impassable because the folks here aren't use to dealing with slick streets. Many cars are off the interstate, and hotels are packed,"" Brown said.  Watch winter storm cause accidents Â» . Snow in Germantown, Tennessee, was more than 5 inches deep by Sunday afternoon, forecasters said.

"JACKSON, Tennessee (CNN) -- Tornadoes and storms in the mid-South have killed 55 people since Tuesday evening in the deadliest tornado outbreak in the United States in more than 20 years. A police officer walks past destroyed cars on the Union University campus in Jackson, Tennessee, Wednesday. The storms ripped apart homes and trapped residents of university dorms and a retirement home in debris. The trail of death stretched across four states, with four people killed in Alabama, 13 in Arkansas, seven in Kentucky and 31 in Tennessee. In some cases, there was almost no warning before the severe weather hit. James Baskin of Jackson, Tennessee, was driving a car when a twister ""just picked us up and threw us,"" he said. Everyone in the car was injured, including his daughter's friend, who suffered a broken collarbone. ""We'll get through it. Nobody's dead. That's the biggest thing,"" Baskin said. The storm system was becoming less intense as it moved east Wednesday, CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said, but the National Weather Service issued tornado and severe storm warnings and said extreme weather still was possible. President Bush said Wednesday he had called the governors of the affected states to offer help and to tell them that ""the American people hold those who suffered up in prayer."" The Federal Emergency Management Agency was deploying teams to the area, Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff said Wednesday. ""We're going to keep watching this,"" he said.  See map of where storms hit Â» . In Sumner County, Tennessee, two victims were found outside a house that had been blown away by the storm, said Jay Austin, the county's primary death investigator. Elsewhere in the area, a mother was found dead in a creek bed about 50 yards from where her house stood. Her baby was found alive 250 yards away. The child was taken to a local hospital, Austin said. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Highway Patrol reported looting in hard-hit Macon County, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. Macon County Mayor Shelvy Linville told CNN Thursday that the death toll in the county had risen to 13. Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen, who flew over the disaster area Wednesday, said he was stunned by the storm's power.  Watch Bredesen describe a 'nightmare' Â» . ""I don't think that I have seen, since I've been governor, a tornado where the combination of the intensity of it and the length of the track was as large as this one,"" Bredesen said. ""That track had to be 25 miles long. [The twister] didn't skip like a lot of them do. ... It's just 25 miles of a tornado sitting on the ground."" In Jackson, Tennessee, a tornado trapped Union University students and retirees in collapsed buildings, said Julie Oaks, a spokeswoman for the state's Emergency Management Agency.  Watch how the tornado devastated the campus Â» . ""It looks like a war zone,"" said university President David Dockery. ""Cars and trucks thrown from one side of the campus to the other."" Dockery said the women's dorms were destroyed, along with two academic buildings. Many other school buildings received lesser damage.  See photos of chaos left by storm Â» . Classes were canceled at least until February 18, he said. Nine students were hospitalized overnight, but there were no life-threatening injuries, according to university spokesman Tim Elsworth. To the west, a tornado swept through the southeastern section of Memphis in Shelby County. The storms yanked the roof off a hangar at Memphis International Airport, the National Weather Service said. Oaks said one person was killed at the Hickory Ridge Mall in Shelby County. Company officials believe a tornado hit a compressor station for the Columbia Gulf Transmission company in Hartsville, Tennessee, about 40 miles northeast of Nashville, setting off a spectacular natural gas fire.  Watch flames leap hundreds of feet Â» . The blaze could be seen in the night sky for miles around, with flames shooting ""400, 500 feet in the air,"" said Tennessee Emergency Management spokesman Donnie Smith. The station was damaged significantly, but there were no reports of injuries or fatalities, said Columbia spokesman Kelly Merritt. ""We would not have had any employees there [overnight]."" The blaze was put out early Wednesday morning, he said. The tornado cut a wide swath near the facility, flattening the home of Dara Reasonover. ""It just took the house and everything and my horses and my dog,"" a shaken Reasonover said, as the glow of the fire lit the sky behind her. ""I don't know if they're alive or dead, but we'll make it."" In Arkansas, the storm killed 13 people in six counties, the state Emergency Management Agency said. In the city of Atkins, a man, woman and child in the same family were killed, county Judge Jim Ed Gibson told CNN. The storms overturned trucks and other vehicles along Interstate 40, closing the highway briefly, he said. Storms also ripped through Kentucky, killing at least seven people. A state of emergency was declared in Muhlenberg County, and Kentucky National Guard troops were deployed, state emergency spokesman Buddy Rogers said. In Alabama, the storms killed four people, three in Lawrence County and one in Jackson County, officials said. Resident Roger Riddle said that when he heard the tornado siren, he rounded up his children and took them to a community storm shelter. When he emerged, he saw the twister traveling away from them and ""total destruction."" ""We've got things tore up, and the house across the road from us is completely gone,"" Riddle said. In Mississippi, the director of the state's Emergency Management Agency, Mike Womack, estimated that 20 to 30 tornadoes pounded the state in areas above the state capital of Jackson. ""We have no reported fatalities, and that is extremely fortunate,"" he said, given the havoc the storm caused elsewhere. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Clouds of black smoke from burning plastic hang over the sites of Nigeria's vast dumps, as tiny figures pick their way through slicks of oily water, past cracked PC monitors and television screens. Toxins from dumped electronics in developing countries has been seen as a growing problem. But it isn't just a cut from broken glass these mainly young scavengers are risking. Much of the discarded electronic kit contains tiny -- but valuable -- quantities of aluminum, copper, cadmium and other minerals, all of which can be sold on, if they can be recovered. However they also contain highly toxic materials, which have been linked to reproductive problems and cancers. ""People living and working on and around the dump sites, many of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of dangerous chemicals that can cause severe damage to health, including cancer, damage to the nervous system and to brain development in children,"" Kim Schoppink, Toxics Campaigner at Greenpeace, told CNN. ""The open burning creates even more hazardous chemicals among which are cancerous dioxins."" No studies have been done on the extent of the chemical pollution of such sites in Nigeria, but in 2008 a Greenpeace report on similar dumps in nearby Ghana confirmed that high levels of lead, phthalates and dioxins were present in soils and the water of a nearby lagoon. A Chinese academic report published in ""Environmental Health Perspectives"" in 2007 confirmed that children living in the same area had higher levels of toxic metals in their blood than other children living nearby. There is increasing evidence that this new health and environment problem is arriving in shipping containers from Western countries. Nigeria is one of the principal global destinations for ""e-waste"" -- the catch-all term for discarded consumer electronics. Some of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an EU or U.S. city, but lax enforcement, vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries' hunger for hi-tech and a burgeoning second hand market. According to the United Nations Environment Program around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year. In 2008 a Greenpeace study, ""Not in My Backyard"", found that in Europe only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely. In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent. Extrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites. But much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped. It's a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime. A report issued by the United Nations in July said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in West Africa were becoming involved with e-waste trading. The volume of material on the move is staggering. In 2005, more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered Nigerian ports every month, according to the Basel Action Network, a U.S. NGO campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste. Each one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste, totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year. These figures are likely to have increased in recent years. There seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to Africa from Western countries. The Basel Action Network and Dutch NGO Danwatch have traced equipment from Europe to Nigerian dumps and earlier this year Greenpeace placed a radio tracking device in a broken TV handed in for safe recycling in the UK, but followed it to a Nigerian market. ""Greenpeace is disappointed especially by U.S. and EU authorities,"" said Schoppink. ""It is toxic waste from the U.S. and EU countries that is causing serious environmental and health problems in Nigeria, a country without the means to deal with this problem. ""The U.S. and EU must play the biggest role in stopping the spread of e-waste; they are most responsible for the problem and have the resources to tackle it. The export of e-waste from the EU is illegal under the Basel Convention and the Waste Shipment Directive, but the laws are not being sufficiently implemented. In the U.S., there is no such law banning this practice. ""In Nigeria the government is talking about stopping imports, but there has been no progress on this to date."" Signs of progress . There are calls from environmental groups likes Greenpeace for electronics producers to do more to phase out their use of hazardous substances, and there are some signs of progress. Several electronics companies already make products using fewer hazardous substances, and others, including Nokia, Philips and Samsung are setting up voluntary collection and recycling systems in countries where they are not legally obliged to. Apple claims its products are now almost entirely free of the worst toxic chemicals. ""If producers continue to use hazardous chemicals in their electronics and to fail to take responsibility for the safe disposal of their products, e-waste will continue to be dumped in developing countries,"" said Schoppink. ""The pollution and related health problems in countries where e-waste is dumped will increase massively as the amount of electronics used worldwide is growing exponentially and the number of countries used as dump sites will grow."" But while the developing world needs the U.S. and EU to take responsibility for their waste, it also needs their discarded computers to train and build a 21st century workforce. ""Nobody is arguing that Africa should be denied access to computers,"" said Tony Roberts, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Computer Aid International, a charity licensed by the UK Environment Agency, which provides recycled computers to developing countries to improve education and healthcare. ""Technical colleges and universities are always short of resources. It is, of course, essential to developing economies escaping poverty to have access to affordable modern technology."" Computer Aid works to close the digital divide between the north and southern hemispheres and offers corporations, including Coca Cola, as well as individuals, a positive way of disposing of electronics. They also believe learning about responsibility for that technology is a crucial part of the exchange. ""Computer Aid argues that, in addition to the PCs, it is essential to also build the skills, knowledge and operating capacity in every country to manage responsible re-use programs and environmentally sound end-of-life recycling."" In the end, this is about everyone involved -- particularly the developed nations -- taking responsibility for their waste. ""It is clear that companies have a moral obligation to treat Africa in exactly the same way that they do, say, Germany,"" said Roberts. Until then, toxic black smoke will continue to cast a shadow over lives across the developing world.","Export of electronic products for recycling creating health and environment problems .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two people without invitations crashed President Obama's first White House state dinner, the U.S. Secret Service said Wednesday. The Secret Service confirmed a Washington Post report that the couple who crashed Tuesday night's dinner were Tareq and Michaele Salahi. The Post described the couple as polo-playing socialites from northern Virginia. A Secret Service checkpoint ""did not follow proper procedures"" to determine if the two were on the guest list for the dinner, said Edwin M. Donovan, a Secret Service special agent, in a statement. Playing down any security threat, Donovan's statement said: ""It is important to note that these individuals went through magnetometers and other levels of security, as did all guests attending the dinner."" The incident represents a security breach for the White House at the Obama administration's biggest social event to date. More than 300 guests, including Cabinet members, diplomats and Hollywood celebrities, attended the dinner in honor of visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ""The Secret Service has tasked our Office of Professional Responsibility with conducting a comprehensive review of the incident,"" Donovan's statement said. Video footage of the dinner showed the couple walking past journalists into the event. On Wednesday, Michaele Salahi's Facebook page included photos of the couple at the dinner, including two pictures with Vice President Joe Biden and another with Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, who was identified on the page as ""Ron"" Emanuel. The couple's names did not appear on the guest list distributed Tuesday by the White House. In an e-mail to CNN, Mahogany Jones, who identified herself as a publicist for the Salahis, said the couple had ""full clearance to attend the state dinner."" Fran Townsend, a homeland security adviser to former President George W. Bush, said the incident likely involved a breakdown at the ""perimeter"" security for the event, which is the first checkpoint that guests encounter. Lying to the Secret Service could bring a felony charge, Townsend said.","Secret Service: Tareq and Michaele Salahi attended state dinner without invitations .

"(CNN) -- The alleged gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on the campus of Richmond High School in Northern California while 10 or more witnesses, most of them students, looked on has sparked familiar questions: ""Why are our kids so messed up?"" ""Why didn't these students try to stop the crime?"" ""What's happening in our schools?"" These are fair questions, and commentators in the media have provided familiar answers. The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the ""bystander effect"": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it. Unfortunately, this ""What's wrong with our children?"" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening. Talking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community. Rather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: ""What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?"" The answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus. Make no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it. Research since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events. According to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, ""I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either."" Virtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is ""a dark alley near the back side of the school,"" the site of the purported rape. As CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area. As important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. . Research shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information. This dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence. Thousands of potential school crimes, including violent ones, have been averted on campuses across the country because students alerted school officials before the crime occurred. Students and families using a hot line in Colorado were credited with preventing more than 206 incidents of school violence from 2004-06. As of summer 2009, this one hot line fielded 1,687 reports that resulted in crime prevention or intervention. Alert students have also helped prevent replays of the tragedies that occurred at Columbine and Virginia Tech by tipping off school officials. Several years ago, student reports stopped a Columbine-style massacre plot, employing bombs, napalm and automatic weapons, at a high school in Green Bay, Wisconsin. This year, tips from students and alert teachers and police disrupted a student-massacre plot, featuring pipe bombs and firearms, at Hillside High School in San Mateo, California. Since Columbine, school shootings have been averted in New Bedford, New York, and Covina, California, to name some others. And at Richmond, it was an 18-year-old bystander, overhearing others talking about the incident, who reported the crime. Unfortunately, the public is largely unaware of these frequently heroic acts by high school students and their teachers because they don't often get national media attention. That lack of information has helped obscure the important roles that students and their responsive teachers play in preventing school violence. But the evidence is clear. Students who know what to do when they witness school violence, or when they have a strong sense of impending violence, will become anonymous heroes. But they need to be taught what to do, which phone numbers -- including hot lines -- to call and which school officials or police department can be trusted to act on their reports. Students also need to feel confident that they can report trouble without fear of retribution from their peers or being called a snitch. It is up to the teachers and administrators who run schools to teach their students these procedures. They need to convince students that they will listen and respond consistently to their reports of violence or possible violence. Yes, local police need to develop trusting relationships with students and the overall community, or nothing will be reported. But the job of preventing violence on campus belongs primarily, if not solely, to the schools. Rather than wring our hands about the so-called immorality of today's students, we should embrace them as full partners in the prevention of violence on campus. Morality is not the issue. If students are educated on what to do when the threat of violence arises and are encouraged to follow the procedures, they can be trusted to do the right thing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ron Astor.","Commentators focused on why students didn't report alleged rape, Astor says .

"Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- Candles in hand and singing hymns, hundreds of Cleveland residents stunned by the discovery of 11 bodies in a local home gathered outside the house Sunday night to remember the victims. But Inez Fortson, whose daughter Telacia was among the dead, said she could barely stand to look at the home. ""It's hard, because I want to burn it down,"" she said. ""I know my baby was in there, and she got killed in there,"" Fortson added. ""I know what other people feel like when they lost a child. I didn't, but I do now. That was my only daughter."" Telacia Fortson, 31, had three children, ages 2, 4 and 6, her mother said. She had last been seen in June. Her body was among the first identified in the home of Anthony Sowell, who is now facing five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. All of those found dead were African-American women. A Cuyahoga County judge has set bail at $5 million for Sowell, a registered sex offender who served 15 years in prison for a 1989 attempted rape case. He was released from jail in 2005. ""Whenever I see him on TV or think about him, I have to pray,"" Fortson said. ""Because I believe that one day, I'll have to forgive him for what he's done. But right now, I can't, because I'm numb."" About 500 people joined the march, which followed a packed memorial service at the neighborhood's Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church. The turnout ""means that people do care,"" Fortson said. ""There is a little compassion in the world."" Mount Olive pastor Larry Harris Sr., who led the memorial service, called the Sowell home a house of ""horror."" ""It brings trembling to the bones to think about what all went on right here,"" he said. Sowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney, according to Sowell's public defender Kathleen DeMetz. A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it's unlikely to happen until after the case goes before a grand jury, the next expected step in the case. Police recovered the first bodies after they went to Sowell's home to follow up on a rape accusation. Last month, neighbors reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor, but no charges were filed. Neighbors called 911 after the October 20 incident. Firefighters and paramedics responded, and later notified police. The woman told officers that she was at the home and ""partying,"" when she fell off the roof. Allen Sowell, the suspect's half-brother, told CNN he last saw his brother more than 20 years ago. Their stepmother, who lived in the house after Anthony Sowell got out of prison, said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time, Allen Sowell said. The stepmother tried to get Anthony Sowell evicted from the house in 2007 because he wasn't paying rent, Allen Sowell said. Anthony Sowell said he shouldn't have to pay rent on a house that belonged to his father, who died in 2004, and remained in the house when his stepmother had to be hospitalized in 2007, his half-brother said. Agents from the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit are assisting Cleveland police, Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson said. The agents are preparing a profile of Sowell for police, tracing his life and habits, and his DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes. Allen Sowell said he was aware of his half-brother's prison record, but ""just couldn't fathom"" the accusations now facing him. ""I didn't think he was in that bad of a mental state,"" Allen Sowell said. ""You never think it would happen to your family. It's a horrible feeling."" At 66, Allen Sowell is 16 years older than his half-brother, and the two didn't meet until Anthony Sowell was 9. He added, ""He deserves whatever he gets from the justice system."" CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","After vigil, ministers walk to Anthony Sowell home, where 11 bodies were found .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan has a unique rÃ©sumÃ©: he served two tours in the country as a general, training Afghan police and troops, before trading his uniform for a diplomat's business suit. His career history may give Karl Eikenberry's word particular weight as President Obama struggles to come up with a way forward in Afghanistan. Eikenberry sent private cables to Obama last week, urging the president not to rush to send more troops to Afghanistan -- although the top U.S. military commander there, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, wants 40,000 more pairs of boots on the ground. Initial reports about the cables sent by Eikenberry appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times. All three newspapers attributed the reports to senior U.S. officials, without identifying them. Two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN that Eikenberry sent two cables to Washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid uncertainty over President Hamid Karzai's government. Neither Eikenberry nor the White House would comment on the contents of private advice between the envoy and the president, but the reports alarmed Karzai enough that his office sought confirmation from the U.S. Embassy about them, a Karzai spokesman told CNN. Karzai's office did not get the information it sought, the spokesman said. Whatever Eikenberry told the president, the ambassador is unusually well versed in the military problems facing Afghanistan. He retired from the Army after nearly 40 years of service with the rank of lieutenant general on April 28 -- one day before he was sworn in as ambassador, according to his State Department biography. His long military career included time in Kabul as U.S. security coordinator and chief of the Office of Military Cooperation. ""Afghanistan has been at the center of my career since 9/11, when the terrorist-commandeered aircraft crashed into the Pentagon just below the office in which I was working,"" Eikenberry said at his Senate confirmation hearing in March. ""There is no silver bullet and no quick, cheap or easy solutions. There is no substitute for more resources and sacrifice,"" he said then. But, he added: ""There is no exclusively military solution to the issues we and our partners confront in Afghanistan."" He also advised the U.S. secretary of defense on China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mongolia, and was deputy director for strategy, plans and policy on the Army staff. But he's not new to embassy life, having served as defense attache at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, China. Eikenberry has a master's degree in east Asian studies from Harvard, an advanced degree in Chinese history from Nanjing University in China, and is a certified translator from Mandarin Chinese. He's also clearly attached to his wife, Ching, insisting in his Senate confirmation hearing that she accompany him to Kabul even though State Department rules barred spouses because the country is so dangerous. He prevailed. He and his wife are hosting a dinner Saturday night in Kabul for a visiting U.S. lawmaker.","Eikenberry retired from the Army after nearly 40 years of service .

"Washington (CNN) -- Army Secretary John McHugh ordered a new investigation into poor record keeping and other problems at Arlington National Cemetery even as a separate investigation ended without an absolute answer to who is buried in a grave marked ""Unknown."" ""As the final resting place of our nation's heroes, any questions about the integrity or accountability of its operations should be examined in a manner befitting their service and sacrifice,"" McHugh said in a statement after signing the order directing the Army's Inspector General to begin an investigation into allegations regarding cemetery operations. The Army IG is already in the middle of an investigation ordered by the previous secretary of the Army to review management of the cemetery. In recent years, the cemetery -- where President Kennedy and thousands of fallen U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are buried -- has had a number of embarrassing problems. In 2008, the cemetery discovered that workers inadvertently buried cremated remains at a grave site already in use. Those remains were moved to another grave site. In 2003, as workers were digging a grave for a new burial, they discovered a casket already buried there. There was no headstone or grave marker to indicate who. Only recently, after a report by a journalist at Salon.com, did the Army take action on the problem. Over the summer, the cemetery put up a headstone on the mystery grave that reads ""Unknown."" As McHugh ordered the new investigation, the Army released results of a separate investigation of problems at the cemetery. That investigation focused on the discovery of the ""Unknown"" grave. A spokesman for the Military District of Washington, which conducted the review, said ""Cemetery records, the MDW investigation, and the non-invasive geophysical analysis of the grave sites strongly indicate that a husband and wife, who died years apart and should have been buried in the same grave site, were instead buried in adjacent graves."" A DNA test of the remains in the two adjacent graves could prove conclusively that is what happened, but the family of the husband and wife did not wish for their remains to be disturbed. The MDW said the Army will abide by the family's wishes and has ordered a headstone to properly mark the wife's grave. One of the problems discovered by the MDW investigation was a possible lack of adequate staffing at the cemetery. Last year Arlington conducted 4,377 burials, up more than 21 percent over the past 10 years. During that same period the number of civilian staff members has dropped nearly 19 percent. Currently the cemetery has four employees to schedule 135 to 150 funerals a week as well as maintain all grave records. Arlington, which sits on a hill across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial, has been the final resting place for America's military heroes since the Civil War, when the Union seized the estate from the family of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. McHugh hopes this new investigation will ""ensure America's confidence in the operation of its most hallowed ground.""","Army Secretary John McHugh orders inquiry into poor record keeping .

"(CNN) -- At an auction at a gallery in New York recently, a piece of artwork sold for a higher price than had been anticipated by the auctioneers: $4,080. It wasn't a very big piece of art -- just 8-by-10 inches. Technically, it wasn't even art. It was a glossy black-and-white photograph. It had a slight imperfection: there were staple holes in the upper left-hand corner. Someone had written all over the front of the photograph. The person who had scrawled on it was, in fact, the subject of the photograph. He had written: . ""To Patricia Keating, with very best wishes, John Kennedy"" That is what made the photo so valuable to someone: Kennedy had held it in his hands, had run his pen over it. The owners of Swann Galleries, where the signed photo was auctioned, believe that Kennedy had autographed the picture in 1956, when he was a United States senator. The picture itself wasn't worth much; but his signature, personalized to Patricia Keating. ... ""As far as we know, she wasn't anyone famous,"" Rebecca Weiss, a Swann Galleries employee, told me on the day after the auction. ""There's no particular significance to her name."" Then why would someone pay more than $4,000 for the photo? Weiss told me that the identities of the buyers and sellers at Swann auctions are kept confidential, so she could not disclose who had consigned the photo for sale, or who had purchased it. But she said there is a pretty safe rule of thumb about the sale of autographs of renowned men and women: . ""What people are buying is the mystique. They are taking home the autograph knowing that this person once actually touched this item, this person once actually left this imprint, this signature."" She clearly knows what she is talking about; just this weekend, it was announced that another auctioneer had sold what is purported to be perhaps the last autograph Kennedy ever signed: a copy of the Dallas Morning News that he reportedly signed for a woman upon his arrival in that city on November 22, 1963. A man in California purchased it for $39,000. In our digital age, in which images and data are transferred from person to person with the tap of a key, it would seem to be an anachronism: the idea of placing enormous monetary value on pieces of paper upon which prominent individuals once wrote their names. But that personal touch seems to have remained precious; Weiss said that many, if not most, purchasers of autographed items display them as if they were rare paintings: framed and mounted in places of honor. She didn't have to convince me. I have only two pieces of art hanging in my home, and neither would qualify as art in the conventional sense. But I wouldn't trade them for Picassos or Van Goghs. The first is an original theater lobby poster for the greatest movie about newspapers ever made: 1952's ""Deadline -- U.S.A."", starring Humphrey Bogart. The other piece of art is an autograph -- actually, an entire (if brief) handwritten letter. It is a thank-you note. A thank-you note written to a laundry. At the top of the piece of paper, embossed in the italics/script font style of 1950s suburban-housewife stationery, are the words: . ""From the home of ... Elvis Presley"" And beneath it, in blue ballpoint pen: . ""I should like to commend your Laundry for doing a fantastic job on my clothes, you show esceptional care. Sincerely E.P."" That's just how, while living in a house on Audubon Drive in Memphis, Tennessee, in the years before he moved to Graceland, he wrote it. ""Laundry"" capitalized in the middle of the sentence; a comma instead of a period after ""clothes""; ""esceptional"" instead of ""exceptional."" I can't imagine a more wonderful or telling artifact from Presley's life. Who writes thank-you notes to their laundries? The young Elvis, that's who. There's such an essential sweetness to it -- to the very fact of the letter, to the formality of his introduction (""I should like to commend...""), to the adjective he chose (""a fantastic job on my clothes""). I purchased the letter from a gallery two decades ago (for a price that made me bite the inside of my mouth), and I would rather own it than the Mona Lisa. I was about to say that I would never part with it, but in fact I once did, for several months. An exhibit called ""American Originals: Treasures from the National Archives"" was touring the country, and was scheduled to make a long stop at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum of the Chicago Academy of Sciences. Included in the exhibit were the original Louisiana Purchase Treaty, Thomas Edison's 1879 patent application for the electric lamp and the instrument of surrender of the German High Command during World War II. I thought Elvis belonged there, and persuaded the curators of the museum to accept his thank-you letter on loan. The National Archives said they would not object, so long as Elvis' note was not in the same room with the more austere documents. It worked out fine; I thought Elvis would like it that way. He always was proud to be an outsider. In the hallway adjacent to the entrance to the main exhibit -- visitors saw it right as they walked in -- was Elvis' handwritten letter, in a display case, with a plaque that read: . ""This note, written by Elvis Presley when he was on the verge of becoming a star, provides an example of how seemingly trivial documents can increase in value and cultural significance as a result of historic events. It also shows that despite his growing fame in the early 1950s, Presley cared about the feelings of others."" Brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it? I can fully understand why someone in New York the other day would purchase the photograph that John Kennedy once signed for Patricia Keating, whoever she may have been. You don't have to be Patricia Keating to comprehend the value of that picture, just as you don't have to be Elvis' laundry to comprehend the value of that thank-you note. Great art, like great beauty, is where you find it. It is, as they say, in the eye -- or the laundry bag -- of the beholder. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Photo signed by JFK recently sold for $4,080, Greene notes .

"Singapore (CNN)  -- While economists fret whether the sharp ""V""-shaped drop of the financial crisis will turn into a double-dipped ""W"" recovery, Tan Pheng Hock is most worried about the ""P"" word: Protectionism. His Singapore-based ST Engineering builds aerospace and transport systems and control centers. Most of the group's $3 billion in revenues come from exports. ""When you have protectionism it breeds like a disease whereby people become so dependent on it,"" Tan said. ""The moment you remove it you get lots of resistance."" As the business and government leaders gather for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Tan has good reason to be concerned. Few economies have borne the brunt of the financial crisis -- or the ""financial tsunami,"" as many Asian nations call it -- as has export-driven Singapore. The city-state's economic output took a record fall, with its GDP dropping 9.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to government statistics. Singapore lives and dies by the global economy. With no natural resources and a small domestic market, in a generation the city-state transformed itself from the third world British colony into a first world economic power by building its economy on exports and business services. While Singapore's economic health is quickly rebounding -- second quarter GDP was down only 3.5 percent, the best performance since the financial crisis exploded in September last year -- protectionist winds threaten to shatter any nascent recovery. ""With the crisis we've been through there have obviously been some protectionist tendencies beginning to rise, particularly in the Western world,"" Tan said. ""I hope we will see those quashed during the course of this week (at APEC)."" Although APEC was built as an avenue to promulgate freer trade among Pacific Rim economies, the first salvos of trade disputes between China and the U.S. have many concerned. In September, the U.S. placed tariffs on Chinese made automobile tires; China responded by cutting off imports of poultry parts (including chicken feet, a delicacy in China) and auto parts. More recently, China has begun an investigation whether Washington bailouts of U.S. carmakers constitutes unfair government supports of U.S. cars sold in China. The fact that the leaders of the two nations will be gathering here on Saturday ahead of U.S. President Barack Obama's first visit to China puts implicit pressure to reduce the protectionist rhetoric, said Tan Khee Giap, chairman of the Singapore National Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation Council. ""At least they have to say that they will resist any form of protectionism at meetings like this,"" Tan said. Whether words will match deeds remains an open question. A survey of 400 business leaders released Wednesday by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council found a majority of those polled believe protectionism is likely to increase if the global recovery stalls. CNN's Andrew Stevens and Kevin Voigt contributed to this story.","Singapore's 2Q GDP down 3.5 percent, best performance since crisis hit .

"(CNN)  -- The New Zealand All Blacks gave their nation double reason for cheer with a 20-6 win Italy before a massive crowd at the San Siro in Milan. With their football counterparts qualifying for the 2010 World Cup finals with a win over Bahrain earlier on Saturday, it was left to Graham Henry's men to complete the double. But they were given a tough fight by underdogs Italy, who were inspired by an 80,000 crowd in a stadium normally reserved for Serie A giants Inter and AC Milan. Henry fielded a largely second-string team after last week's 19-12 defeat of Wales in Cardiff. Italy briefly led as former Australian rugby league international Craig Gower kicked a penalty. But New Zealand pulled ahead with two Luke McAlister penalties and Corey Flynn put them further ahead with the only try of the game after 25 minutes. McAlister landed another penalty before halftime to send the visitors into the break with a 14-3 lead. After the interval he kicked two further penalties with Gower getting his second for Italy. The All Blacks next play England, who saw off Argentina 16-9 at Twickenham in a poor quality match in difficult conditions. A late try by Matt Banahan gave Martin Johnson's men the edge and his sixth win from 13 games in charge. Fly-half star Jonny Wilkinson provided all of England's points in the first half, with a drop-goal and two penalties as the scores were tied at 9-9 at the half. Center Martin Rodriguez, one of a trio of Argentina debutants, kicked three penalties from five attempts to keep them level until the late home try. In other international action, former England coach Andy Robinson led his new Scotland team to a 23-10 win over Fiji. Johnnie Beattie and Graeme Morrison went over for tries for Scotland at Murrayfield. On Friday night, France shocked world champions South Africa 20-13 in Toulouse. The Tri-Nations champions paid the price for ill-discipline as Julien Dupuy kicked four penalties and Morgan Parra one. Winger Vincent Clerc capped a fine performance for the home side with a try. South Africa's points came from Morne Steyn with a penalty and drop-goal as well as converting a fine try by captain John Smit.","New Zealand All Blacks beat Italy 20-6 in rugby union international .

"(CNN)  -- This Twitter thing has been coming on like gangbusters. The messaging site has been around for a couple of years, but its popularity seems to have exploded just recently. A self-admitted tech geek, Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com, a blogging network. Everyone from BarackObama to John Cleese to NASA to the consulate of Israel has a Twitter account. Heck, even yours truly does! Do you? Follow me and I'll follow you back. Twitter is really more of a social commons than a full-blown social network like MySpace or Facebook. It pretty much does one thing: allows people to ""tweet"" what they're up to (or what they're thinking about) in 140 characters or less. Call it micro-blogging, if you will, but it's about as close to the ""Keep It Simple, Stupid"" (K.I.S.S.) ideal as it gets. People can follow your tweets and you can follow theirs -- that's pretty much it. There are some third-party apps out there that can help you organize and seek out the information flying around out there in the Twittersphere, but it all pretty much stays in the nutshell. With the overwhelming amount of widgets and gadgets and gizmos and doohickeys and whatnots attached to every other social network out there, isn't it nice to be able to get away with plain ol' simple every now and again? Since we're sticking with the ""less is more"" aesthetic, I'm just going to give you 10 Twitter tips instead of the 20 I could have stretched this into. You're welcome! 1. Be yourself, but beware.

"(CNN) -- Suspected Somali pirates hijacked a Greek-owned bulk carrier Wednesday with 22 crew members aboard, according to the European Union's Naval Force for Somalia. MV Filitsa was seized in the early morning about 460 miles (740 kilometers) northeast of the Seychelles as it headed toward Durban, South Africa, according to a news release from EU NAVFOR Somalia. The Marshall Island-flagged carrier -- with three Greek and 19 Filipino crew members -- ""has now turned around and is heading north,"" it said. The bulk carrier has a deadweight of more than 23,000 tons. There have been more than 100 pirate attacks and at least 39 hijackings off the east Africa this year, according to EU NAVFOR. In late October, Somali pirates seized a private yacht in the Indian Ocean, taking Paul and Rachel Chandler hostage. They have demanded a $7 million ransom for the British couple's release, but the government has refused to pay as a matter of long-standing policy. Two vessels were attacked the day after the Chandlers set sail. One of them -- a cargo ship -- was successfully boarded and seized off the Seychelles, while the other fought off its attackers near the Kenyan coast. Pirates are still holding a Spanish fishing boat, the Alakrana, which they seized on October 2 off Somalia's coast. Days later, they transferred three of the fishing boat's 36 crew members to land. Two pirate suspects had left the Alakrana in a small vessel heading toward land, authorities said, and the Spanish military swooped in to stop them on the high seas. They were later brought to Madrid, where a judge has charged them with piracy and kidnapping. The pirates holding the crew have demanded Spain release the two suspects. Spain is part of the European Union task force against piracy in the Indian Ocean off Somalia. The Spanish parliament last January agreed to increase Spain's presence with up to 395 troops and assets, including a frigate and aircraft.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Snow and ice dealt a major blow to U.S. air travel Thursday, while much of the nation shivered from record low temperatures. At least 400 flights at Chicago, Illinois', O'Hare International Airport were canceled. Arriving flights were being delayed an average of 45 minutes and outgoing flights about 30 minutes, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Chicago's Midway Airport and Newark International Airport in New Jersey also reported delays. Those bottlenecks were affecting flights at many other international airports. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service was keeping an eye on a dangerous mix of ice and snow expected in the Southeast, where temperatures have dipped between 10 to 35 degrees below normal for the past two weeks, said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines offered to issue winter weather travel waivers to Delta and Northwest passengers on flights to, from or through five states. Travelers can change their schedule without fees until Saturday if their routes include Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi or Tennessee. The arctic blast that began last weekend has been blamed for at least seven deaths across the nation. Share your photos, video of winter weather . Record-breaking lows were forecast for two-thirds of the country, for most areas east of the Rockies. For some regions, even lower temperatures are on tap through the weekend, forecasters said. ""But the brunt of the cold air will ride down the Mississippi River,"" said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano, reporting from Memphis, Tennessee. Marciano said temperatures have been the lowest there in more than a decade. ""You have people not used to this weather, and homes are not built for this weather. Yesterday alone, the city [Memphis] went around to turn on the heat for homes when people have not been able to pay [their utility bills]."" Alabama issued a warning to drivers Thursday night, urging them to stay off icy roads as driving conditions were ""becoming dangerous"" with numerous accidents reported. Trooper Curtis Summerville with the Alabama State Patrol said the biggest problem on the roads was black ice on overpasses and bridges. But, he said football was helping keep people at home as University of Alabama fans cheered on their team in the National Championship Game against the University of Texas. A wind chill advisory was in effect until Friday in Arkansas, where readings were expected to drop below zero with winds of over 30 mph. A dusting of snow in Atlanta on Thursday night left roads slick after two weeks of below normal temperatures. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers noted that it was warmer in Fairbanks, Alaska, than it was in Atlanta on Thursday morning, calling the cold front sweeping the nation one that ""we probably haven't seen for 15 years."" 29-car pileup near Atlanta airport . In the Deep South, Florida was under a state of emergency because of the threat to the state's lucrative citrus and vegetable industries. Gov.

Also suffering in the cold: sea turtles. Florida Fish & Wildlife officers have rescued 120 sea turtles after water temperatures in the 40s shocked their tropically inclined systems, according to CNN affiliate WPBF. ""Their bodies are shutting down because they're too cold,"" Karrie Minch of the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge told WPBF. ""If we don't rescue them, they'll end up expiring."" Elsewhere Thursday, the high in Bismarck, North Dakota, was around 11 degrees below zero, with a wind chill of minus 35. Forecasters said the wind chill could dip to 52 degrees below zero overnight. Snowfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches were forecast Thursday for the upper Plains to the Northeast and as far south as Kentucky and Tennessee. Up to 7 inches fell in parts of Illinois. School districts in Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, called off classes Thursday and city governments reported burning through their entire snow removal budgets with a full two months of winter left. Jeras said the long stretch of cold weather in the South is ""extremely unusual."" Dallas, Texas, where it was 24 on Thursday, has been experiencing the longest stretch of cold weather in more than a decade, she said. The Southeast is expected to see lower temperatures by Saturday.

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Council for Human Rights began debate Thursday over whether to adopt the recommendations of a controversial U.N. report examining the three-week winter war between Israel and the militant group Hamas in Gaza. An Israeli soldier sits on a tank on the Israel-Gaza border just before fighting began in December 2008. The report, based on a fact-finding mission led by former South African jurist Richard Goldstone, was released last month and concluded that Israel and Hamas had both committed ""actions amounting to war crimes, possibly crimes against humanity."" Speaking at the start of the meeting, Israeli Ambassador Aharon Leshno Yaar blasted the United Nations for even holding the special session. Yaar said it ""had nothing to do with human rights and everything to do with Palestinian politics."" He said adoption of the ""biased"" recommendations of the Goldstone report, which calls for further action by the General Assembly and Security Council if both sides do not conduct credible investigations, would constitute a ""reward for terror"" that ""will set back hopes for peace in the region."" Previously, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the Palestinian Authority that pushing action on the Goldstone report would deal ""a mortal blow"" to the peace process. The council received the report September 29 but took no action, after a request by the Palestinian Authority to defer discussion for six months. The Palestinian Authority government of Mahmoud Abbas came under withering domestic criticism for the move and was accused of succumbing to Israeli and American pressure to drop the issue. Abbas reversed course Sunday and in a televised address told Palestinians that he was seeking immediate debate within the Human Rights Council and vowed to work ""to punish everyone who was responsible for the hideous crimes committed against our children, our men and women -- especially in our dear Gaza."" Ibrahim Khraishi, the Palestinian Authority's U.N. ambassador in Geneva, said Israel had rebuffed the Palestinian Authority's conciliatory move to defer debate on the report and instead had answered ""with even more grave violations of the rights of Palestinians"" in the form of restrictions of movement and housing demolitions in East Jerusalem. The 47-member Human Rights Council is expected to vote on the resolution on Friday. The draft resolution goes beyond the Gaza conflict. It ""strongly condemns"" measures taken by Israel limiting Palestinians' access to their properties and holy sites ""on the basis of national origin, religion, sex, age or any other discriminatory ground."" It further condemns ""Israeli violations of human rights in Occupied East Jerusalem, particularly the confiscation of lands and properties, the demolishing of houses and private properties, the construction and expansion of settlements, the continuous construction of the separation wall, changing the demographic and geographic character of East Jerusalem, the restrictions on the freedom of movement of the Palestinian citizens of East Jerusalem, as well as the continuous digging and excavation works in and around Al-Aqsa mosque and its vicinity."" There is an ongoing dispute about the number of people killed in the three-week military offensive that Israel called Operation Cast Lead, which began December 27 and ended January 18. The Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights put the death toll at 1,419 and said 1,167 of those were non-combatants. The Israeli military released its own figures earlier this year, saying that 1,166 people were killed, 60 percent of whom were ""terror operatives.""","Report says both Israel and Hamas took ""actions amounting to war crimes""

"(CNN) -- A suspect has been arrested in the slaying of a 19-year-old Puerto Rican man found Friday decapitated, dismembered and partially burned, police said Tuesday. Members of the U.S. gay community are asking authorities to investigate whether the slaying was a hate crime because the victim, Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado, was gay, said Pedro Julio Serrano of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ""The brutality of the slaying and the fact that he was openly gay leads us to believe it was very possibly a hate crime,"" Serrano said. Authorities are investigating whether the killing involved sex, Guayama police Commander Hector Agosto Rodriguez told CNN affiliate WLII TV. Guayama prosecutor Jose Bermudez identified the suspect as Juan A. Martinez, 26. Police had earlier described him as a 27-year-old man from the interior Puerto Rican town of Cayey. Martinez was scheduled to attend a court hearing Tuesday night at which charges would be lodged, said Luis Bernier, a spokesman for the Guayama police district, which has jurisdiction in the case. The hearing was postponed several times throughout the day. Officials were waiting for a prosecutor from a nearby district, causing the delay, Bernier said. The FBI was not directly involved in the investigation Monday, said FBI Agent Harry Rodriguez of the San Juan office. ""The FBI is monitoring this investigation by police in Puerto Rico,"" Rodriguez said. ""Any assistance that the police requests or requires, we would be more than happy to provide."" Puerto Rican authorities may ask for help with forensics or other advanced investigative tools the FBI could provide, Rodriguez said. The U.S. attorney's office, in consultation with local officials and other agencies, would determine if the slaying was a hate crime, which is a federal offense. ""It's at a very preliminary stage,"" said Lymarie Llovet, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in San Juan, Puerto Rico's capital. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, which means federal agencies have jurisdiction. ""There's the potential for a federal investigation,"" Rodriguez said. The suspect was arrested Monday around 11:30 p.m. AST (10:30 p.m. ET) at his home in the Mogote de Cayey neighborhood, said Wilson Porrata Mariani, another spokesman for the Guayama police district. Police impounded two cars and also are investigating a home in another neighborhood, Huertas del Barrio Beatriz de Cidra. Lopez Mercado's body was found on Puerto Rico Road 184 in another part of town, Barrio Guavate de Cayey, police said. The slaying has reverberated throughout the gay and lesbian community in the United States, where supporters started a Facebook page called ""Justice for Jorge Steven Lopez -- End Hate Crimes."" The group demands an investigation by Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno and prosecution of the slaying under the Federal Hate Crimes Law. The law was enacted in 1969 to guard the rights of U.S. citizens engaged in any of six protected activities, such as voting, going to school, applying for a job or attending a public venue. Last month, President Obama signed into law the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which extends federal protection against illegal acts motivated by a person's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. Gay activist Serrano said he does not believe anti-gay sentiment is any stronger in Puerto Rico's Latin culture than anywhere else. ""That's a long-debunked myth, that our culture is more homophobic,"" Serrano said. Instead, he attributed any ill will toward gays to ""hate rhetoric"" by some religious and political leaders. One politician, he said, recently referred to gays as ""twisted and mentally ill."" ""That's the kind of rhetoric that incites violence against gays,"" Serrano said. Equality Forum, an international gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights organization, asked for a federal investigation. ""Equality Forum calls on U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to have the FBI investigate,"" said former federal prosecutor Malcolm Lazin, the group's executive director. ""The Matthew Shepard Amendment empowers and requires the federal government to prosecute this horrific murder."" Serrano said Lopez Mercado was a ""very, very dear friend"" he had met through a mutual acquaintance. ""Jorge was a person who you only needed one minute to fall in love with,"" Serrano said. Lopez Mercado often volunteered for gay causes, Serrano said. The teen's family is coping, considering the circumstances. ""It has been horrible, but they are very grateful that it has come to a quick resolution,"" Serrano said.","NEW: Activist attributes ill will toward gays to some religious, political leaders' ""hate rhetoric""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Tyrese Gibson is far from the first singer to make the transition from music to movies. However, the ""Transformers"" star is blazing a whole new trail with his latest crossover venture. Tyrese Gibson voices ""Mayhem,"" a hero described as the ""embodiment of raw justice and vengeance."" The actor/singer/model has partnered with Apple to develop his own comic book series called ""Mayhem,"" and he's doing it in a very nontraditional way -- digitally. ""There was an experience that I felt was pretty limiting as far as the comic book experience itself on paper,"" says Gibson, who stresses that he did not grow up reading comic books and is not a comic book veteran. ""[So] I set up this technology with my team and this is the first-ever digital comic book [on iTunes] in the history of comic books."" The third issue of ""Mayhem,"" which is downloadable from iTunes, is the first to go digital. It features an interactive version of a comic book with sound effects, page turns and even voiceover. Gibson himself voices the title character, a masked, dagger-hurling hero described as the ""embodiment of raw justice and vengeance."" Gibson's new hobby is another example of Hollywood's love affair with comic books. Just last month, Walt Disney Studios acquired Marvel Entertainment -- and all 5,000 of the comic book company's characters -- for $4 billion in cash and stock. With the success of action films based on comic book notables, including ""Batman,"" ""Iron Man"" and ""Wolverine,"" it's not a stretch to think that Gibson might be strapping on the ""Mayhem"" costume for a summer blockbuster in the future. But for now, Gibson is focused on the early stages of his new venture. Although he would not provide details on sales figures, he did say that worldwide sales of ""Mayhem"" would ""knock your socks off."" The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: What turned you on to comic books? Tyrese Gibson: I went out to Comic-Con about a year or so ago to promote the film ""Death Race."" When I was out there, I really got to know some of the fans and I was just asking questions like, ""Look at you, you've got a full on Superman costume on or Batman costume,"" and they were just like, ""I just love comic books."" It was the first time I was ever exposed to that much selfless passion, to the point to where you don't care how silly you may look -- you don't even consider it silly. ... That really did something for me, because I'm motivated by passion. I thought ... I want to figure a way to be a part of this world, and that's when ""Mayhem"" was born."" CNN: Where did the story of ""Mayhem"" come from? Gibson: Me and my partner Mike Lee and Will Wilson all got together, we started brainstorming about different concepts and different directions we could send this character in and we came up with something pretty unique. It's an ongoing series and so as soon as you think you've got it figured out, there's a cliffhanger that makes you want to read the second issue and the third issue. CNN: You're a newcomer to this genre. What's been the feedback from the comic book community? Gibson: In everything you do, there's gonna be cynics and those folks questioning what your motivation is behind getting into anything. I dealt with it when I went from one career move to the next: ""Man, stick to singing; stick to acting."" I dealt with a lot of that from certain folks in the comic book world. ... They wrote these long e-mails and [started] on a smear campaign. I came into this whole thing very innocent. I discovered my love for comic books and I want as many people as possible to experience my comic book. There's this digital revolution that's out there but the comic book world has not embraced this digital revolution on a level that it should be embraced on. And so I reached out to my contacts and I set up a meeting ... and this is my baby. CNN: Artist Jim Lee is very big in the comic book world. How did he get involved in this project? Gibson: I found Jim Lee on Twitter ... and we just kind of took it from there. CNN: What did you learn from him? Gibson: So much, so much. He basically made me aware of all of the big players in the comic world like Alan Moore and Grant Morrison. He just painted this picture about who's who in the comic book world and he schooled me on that level. CNN: A lot of comic book characters become heroes on the big screen. Does ""Mayhem"" have a future in film? Gibson: Right now, there is no conversation on any level about ""Mayhem"" becoming a film. We've been approached a few times but my mind state is this: You can't expect to sell out the Staples Center until you sell a bunch of records. So we're really trying to establish the fan base for ""Mayhem"" before we try to turn it into film. There's still plenty of time for that.","Tyrese Gibson, who starred in ""Transformers,"" has created comic book superhero .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russia is planning a ""comprehensive rearmament"" of its military, President Dmitry Medvedev said Tuesday. A Russian T-90 tank rolls through Red Square during 2008's Victory Day parade. The announcement comes amid concerns in Moscow over the performance of its forces during last year's invasion of Georgia, an expert on the Russian military told CNN. Christopher Langton, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said the campaign against the former Soviet republic had revealed significant weaknesses within Russia's armed forces. ""The Georgia thing was a wake-up call on a number of fronts,"" said Langton, a former British military and defense attache in Russia. ""Things they expected to perform well didn't -- communications, the air force. It took five days, which is quite a long time, to suppress another country's air defenses, quite a small country's."" Medvedev said the ""most important task is to re-equip the [Russian] Armed Forces with newest weapons system,"" in televised remarks to defense ministry officials. He said the process had already begun and would accelerate through 2011. Medvedev insisted that falling prices for oil and gas -- which contribute significantly to Moscow's budget -- would not force him to scale back on plans to modernize the military. The defense budget has ""virtually remained the same as was planned,"" Medvedev said, ""despite our current financial problems."" The country will aim for 70 percent of its weaponry to be ""modern"" by 2020, Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov said, according to RIA-Novosti, the state-run news agency. Russia invaded Georgia, to its south, in August of last year -- the first time Russian military forces had engaged in an offensive outside their borders since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The conflict strengthened the hand of Medvedev, who favors reform, against generals who oppose it, Langton, the military analyst, told CNN. ""It gave Medvedev a chance to reply to opponents in Ministry of Defense: 'We need much more mobile forces, better weaponry,'"" Langton said. But Langton pointed out that Russia has been talking about modernizing its army almost since the end of the Cold War nearly two decades ago. Former President Boris Yeltsin announced in the early 1990s that Russia would replace its conscript army with a professional force by 2010, Langton said -- a target it has come nowhere close to meeting. Modernization foundered on Russia's need to bring in money by exporting arms, rather than using the products of its military-industrial complex itself; opposition from entrenched interests in the Ministry of Defense, which opposed downsizing; and in the face of a national security strategy that focused on conflicts like the two Chechen wars. Former President Vladimir Putin staked his popularity in the late 1990s on winning the second war with the restive Chechnya, Langton observed. Medvedev, too, wants to promote pride in the country's military, the analyst said, but has a ""more nuanced approach"" than his predecessor, who remains influential as prime minister. Langton said Medvedev believes Russian forces should be capable of operating alongside Western forces. But, he added, ""Some of the generals don't agree with him.""","Russia planning ""comprehensive rearmament"" of its military, Moscow announces .

"(CNN)  -- A 7-year-old boy from El Paso, Texas, was gunned down across the border in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN Tuesday. Raul Xazziel Ramirez had been visiting his father in Juarez on Friday evening when unknown gunmen fired on their vehicle at a roundabout, spokesman Arturo Sandoval said. At least 18 rounds from a 9 mm weapon were shot at the white 2000 Geo Tracker driven by Ramirez's dad, Sandoval said. The father, Raul Ramirez Alvarado, 35, died in the driver's seat. The younger Raul escaped from the vehicle, but was apparently shot in the back, Sandoval said. The boy's body fell forward in front of the vehicle. The shooting happened just before 8 p.m. Friday. No arrests had been made as of Tuesday, the spokesman said. Raul Xazziel Ramirez was a third-grader at Glen Cove Elementary School in El Paso, Ysleta Independent School District spokeswoman Patricia Ayala told CNN. ""It's a senseless tragedy that we're trying to come to terms with,"" she said. According to El Paso County records, Raul was just three weeks shy of his eighth birthday when he was killed. The boy lived with his aunt and uncle in El Paso, Ayala said. It was the first semester that Raul was registered with the district. Raul's classmates were spared the details of his death, but the school was nonetheless shocked at the boy's passing. Grief counselors were made available for both students and teachers, Ayala said. More than 2,200 killings have been recorded this year in Ciudad Juarez, out of a population of approximately 1.5 million people. A bloody turf war between warring drug cartels that started last year has made the city one of the most violent in the world. According to statistics from local prosecutors, Ciudad Juarez records about 10 murders a day. The bloodiest month this year has been September, with 476 killings reported. The violence has not spilled over significantly across the border to El Paso, but as Friday's shooting showed, the pain of one of the sister cities is shared by the other. Because of the ongoing investigation, Sandoval declined to say whether drug cartel activity was suspected in the killings of Raul and his father, but added that at least 90 percent of the city's homicides are drug-related. Raul was not the youngest victim slain this year. In early 2009, a 3-year-old girl was killed together with her father inside a vehicle that was targeted, Sandoval said.","NEW: Raul Xazziel Ramirez was just three weeks shy of his eighth birthday, records show .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As thousands gathered Sunday in Washington for a march and rally focused on gay rights issues, lawmakers showed that some of the demonstrators' key goals face major obstacles ahead. President Obama speaks to a major gay-rights group Saturday night in Washington. Even with President Obama pushing Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act -- a stance he highlighted to one of the nation's leading gay-rights groups Saturday night, to huge applause -- members of his own party told CNN they're not in lockstep. ""I've said in the past I don't think that's the way to go,"" Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, told CNN's John King. He added, ""We can move forward on a lot of measures, but I'm not sure there's the support yet for that."" Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, noted that her state is one of many that has a law prohibiting same-sex marriage. ""So I think, for a number of us, that becomes a challenge,"" she said. Stabenow would not say whether she would vote to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. The law, signed by President Clinton in 1996, defines marriage as being between a man and a woman, and ensures that states do not have to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. Clinton has since changed his mind, and said he no longer opposes same-sex marriage. Obama does not support same-sex marriage and has said he believes marriage is between a man and a woman. He does, however, support civil unions for same-sex couples that offer similar rights and protections. The two Democratic senators on Sunday expressed support for the president's stances on several other key issues regarding gay rights, including legislation expanding the definition of hate crimes to include attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill passed the House last week. Both also expressed support for the president's efforts to end the military's ""Don't ask, don't tell"" policy. On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said he thinks the president will succeed on that front. ""I think he will and he can, but it has to be done in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible,"" Levin said. ""Other militaries in the West -- the British and other Western armies -- have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully, but it ought to be done with thoughtfulness, with care and with a buy-in from the military."" Retired Gen. Richard Myers, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, ""Gays can serve in the military; they just can't do so openly. And they do, and there are lots of them, and we're the beneficiary of all that."" Myers did not weigh in on whether the change should happen, but said he agreed with Levin that the ""senior military leadership needs to be part of this, the Pentagon needs to be part of this."" But retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey disagreed. ""There's no question that it's time to change the policy. The key to it isn't buy-in from the military; it's for Congress to change the law. They ought to do so, and I'm confident that the military will move ahead on it,"" he said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, rejected McCaffrey's suggestion. ""It's my belief that if you don't have buy-in from the military, that's a disservice to the people in the military. They should be included in this. I'm open-minded to what the military may suggest, but I can tell you I'm not going to make policy based on a campaign rally,"" Graham told NBC. ""If this policy about 'Don't ask, don't tell' changes, it should be done based not on politics, but on reason."" In his speech Saturday night to the Human Rights Campaign -- the nation's largest gay rights group -- Obama praised the gay community for making strides in equal rights and pledged to deliver on major campaign promises that critics say he's left on the back burner. ""For nearly 30 years, you've advocated for those without a voice,"" Obama said. ""Despite the progress we've made, there are still laws to change and hearts to open.""","Some Democrats cautious about Obama's pledge to end Defense of Marriage Act .

The atmospheric game pits Batman against Joker in a battle of wits and brawn after the Clown Prince of Crime traps the Caped Crusader inside Arkham Asylum, Gotham's psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane. After the trap is sprung, the Joker releases the inmates, including some of Batman's most ferocious enemies: Bane, Harley Quinn, Mr. Zsasz, Poison Ivy and Killer Croc. Batman has appeared in video games since 1986, but none as ambitious or complex as ""Arkham Asylum,"" which draws much of its inspiration from the character's comic mythology. The game will be released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows. It's being developed by Rocksteady Studios and will be published by Eidos Interactive in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. (Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment is a division of Time Warner, which owns CNN.) As the lead writer for the game, Dini said he was given a clean slate to work from. Because there was no movie, graphic novel or comic tie-in to follow, he was able to create an original story. Dini's familiarity with the main character may help win the hearts and wallets of gamers. Winner of five Emmy awards, Dini has worked on Batman comic books and written episodes of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and later, ""Batman Beyond."" Dini, who has also written for the ABC-TV hit ""Lost,"" said he was influenced by Batman lore from character creator Bob Kane, the Batman comics of the 1960s and the Dark Knight graphic novels of Frank Miller. In creating his story's look and tone, Dini said he chose his favorite elements from different incarnations of Batman. For example, the game emphasizes Batman's intellect and use of technology by solving puzzles with the help of such tools as X-ray scanning and a pheromone tracker. ""Detective work is a crucial game element,"" Dini said. ""There are a lot of forensics aspects to the story."" If you're expecting a Heath Ledger-like Joker in ""Batman: Arkham Asylum,"" you may be disappointed. With his less-smudgy makeup, spiky green hair and maniacal cackle, Dini's creation looks and acts more like earlier versions of the iconic villain. Kevin Conroy voices Batman in the game, while the Joker is voiced by Mark Hamill, known to millions as Luke Skywalker in the ""Star Wars"" movies. Conroy and Hamill were scheduled to join Dini at Comic-Con this weekend. Both actors also did the voices in ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" making the game feel very familiar. Sterling McGarvey, a senior editor for G4TV, said the game's developers were smart to rely heavily on the animated TV series. ""An entire generation of Batman fans grew up with the animated Batman,"" he said. ""It is a beloved, storied franchise with very few good games."" The Internet is full of videos showing glimpses of the game, including movie-like trailers, demo gameplay, characters and layouts of Arkham Asylum. Among Batman fans and gaming reviewers, early reviews have been strong. Brian Crecente, editor-in-chief of Kotaku.com, said he likes the way the developers combined elements to create the ultimate Batman from the fans' perspective. ""Part dark, broody Batman, part serious crime fighter, but also part detective,"" Crecente said. ""Batman has this huge universe. Why not cherry-pick the best stuff and put it in the game?"" A key character in the game is Arkham Asylum itself, with its spooky corridors and Gothic architecture. Dini loves its ""mix of dark, creepy, steam punk and Victorian"" and calls it the perfect location in Gotham City for the gameplay. ""It is a totally over the top mansion with gargoyles on the inside,"" added Crecente. ""Very cool."" Dini heaped praise on how the developers made his story come to life. He hopes fans who know Batman will love how familiar it feels, while gamers will love the action. ""Fans of the canon will be happy,"" McGarvey agreed. ""But the game was designed more for the Batman fan than a hardcore gamer."" Crecente describes the game's combat as fluid and quick, with a martial arts feel. Acting as Batman, players will be able to hide in the shadows and stealthily take out their enemies. All the gaming mechanics in the world won't save Batman unless fans get drawn into the story. Remember Lego Batman? But Dini seems confident that gamers will respond to his vision. ""Nobody loves a good Batman story more than I do,"" he said.","Online buzz is strong for upcoming ""Batman: Arkham Asylum"" video game .

"Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. William Jefferson was sentenced Friday to 13 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release for his conviction on 11 counts of corruption. Jefferson was also ordered to forfeit more than $470,000 after his conviction for using his office to solicit bribes. He will also have to pay $1,100 in special assessments. The case against the former nine-term Louisiana Democrat included allegations of influence-peddling and the discovery of $90,000 in cash in his freezer. Judge T.S. Ellis will determine at a hearing next Wednesday whether Jefferson will remain free pending appeal. Until then, he is free. ""The court's sentence today reaffirms the principle that all people -- no matter what their title or position -- are equal before the law,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman in a statement. ""In a stunning betrayal of the public's trust, former Congressman Jefferson repeatedly used his public office for private gain. The lengthy prison sentence imposed on Mr. Jefferson today is a stark reminder to all public officials that the consequences of accepting bribes can and will be severe."" Jefferson's family was in the courtroom when District Judge T.S. Ellis handed down the sentence. He had faced up to 150 years in prison. ""This sentence should be a clear signal that our society will not tolerate bribery,"" U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride said in a written statement. ""It's not just another cost of doing business in government. ""Mr. Jefferson's repeated attempts to sell his office caused significant damage to the public's trust in our elected leaders. This sentence will begin to repair that damage and to restore that trust. ""Mr. Jefferson is well-known for the $90,000 found in his freezer. It is our hope that he will now be well-known for the tough sentence handed down today, showing that no one -- including our elected officials -- are above the law."" Jefferson, of New Orleans, still faces the forfeiture of nearly $500,000 -- money a jury said is linked to criminal activity for which he has been convicted. On August 5, a jury found Jefferson guilty on four bribery counts, three counts of money laundering, three counts of wire fraud and one count of racketeering. He was acquitted on five other counts, including wire fraud and obstruction of justice. He had remained free prior to Friday's sentencing. Jefferson was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 4, 2007, about two years after federal agents said they found the money in his freezer. Authorities said the cash was part of a payment in marked bills from an FBI informant in a transaction captured on video. The trial was delayed while it was resolved whether an FBI search of Jefferson's congressional office was constitutional. Defense attorney Robert Trout had asked the judge for leniency, citing Jefferson's personal history of humble beginnings and long-standing public service. Prosecutors, in turn, filed a response saying Jefferson deserved no preferential treatment since he ""still chose to cheat, steal and lie."" ""Congressman Jefferson has still not accepted responsibility for his own criminal conduct,"" prosecutors wrote. He ""still rationalizes his own unethical, illegal and immoral conduct."" CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.","NEW: Jefferson remains free at least until Wednesday hearing .

"(CNN) -- A newborn infant, who was abducted Tuesday from his home in Tennessee, has been found alive in Alabama, according to authorities. Yair Anthony Carillo is reported to be in good health since being recovered. Yair Anthony Carillo was found Friday night in a home in Ardmore after an intensive three-day search, said Mark Gwyn, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Tammy Renee Silas, 39, was taken into custody for allegedly stabbing Maria Gurrolla at her Nashville home and then stealing the baby just four days after he was born. Gurrolla told police a woman posing as an immigration worker attacked her and took Carillo. A break in the case came when investigators were able to track down a Kia Spectra that was photographed in a Wal-Mart parking lot shortly before the attack. Authorities determined that Silas rented the vehicle from the Nashville airport, Gwyn said. My Harrison, of the FBI's Memphis office, praised all of the investigators who worked on the case. ""We reunited a family,"" she said. ""It doesn't always turn out this way."" There is no word on a possible motive or what charges Silas will face. Carillo, who is reported in good health, will be reunited with his family after a routine medical examination, Harrison said.","Yair Anthony Carillo found safe after being abducted days after birth, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal have confirmed that striker Robin van Persie will be out of action for ""approximately six weeks"" after suffering ankle ligament damage during the Netherlands' international friendly against Italy on Saturday. Initially it had been feared the Dutch forward -- who has scored eight goals in 15 games in all competitions this season and emerged as one of the Gunners' key figures -- could be set for a much-longer spell on the sidelines. Van Persie, 26, will return to London later this week to continue his rehabilitation but is set to miss key clashes with Premier League leaders Chelsea at the end of the month, the trip to Liverpool on December 13 as well as the rest of the hectic Christmas schedule. An official Arsenal club statement read: ""Following the care given to van Persie by the Dutch FA, he will travel back to London this week and continue his treatment with the Arsenal medical team. ""Van Persie will be out of action for approximately six weeks."" Although van Persie could be back for what is likely to be a season-defining few weeks when Arsenal host Manchester United on January 31 before games against Chelsea and then Liverpool, the loss of the player could not have come at a worse time for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner (groin) and England forward Theo Walcott (knee) are already out until early December, so Croatian international Eduardo da Silva is likely to take van Persie's place in the Gunners side. Van Persie suffered the injury to his right leg in the 10th minute of Saturday's goalless draw against Italy in Pescara. He was carried off on a stretcher following a heavy challenge from Azzurri defender Giorgio Chiellini and tests showed partially torn ligaments in his right ankle. Meanwhile, France defender Eric Abidal will miss the second leg of the World Cup playoff against the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday night due to a thigh injury. The Barcelona full-back played the full 90 minutes of Saturday's 1-0 win in Dublin but sustained the problem in his left leg and will not be available for the return at the Stade de France. Lyon midfielder Jeremy Toulalan has also been ruled out, as he has not yet recovered from a hamstring injury.","Arsenal reveal that striker Robin van Persie will be out of actionfor six weeks .

"(CNN) -- Ten-man Ghana overcame Brazil 4-3 on penalties in the Under-20 World Cup final in Cairo to become the first African side to win the tournament. Daniel Addo (left) is sent off but Ghana still became the first African side to win the U-20 World Cup. Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu scored the winning penalty after Brazil's Maicon had fired over the bar when a successful spot-kick would have handed Brazil the title for a record fifth time. In a match of few chances, Ghana, who are also African champions, defied the odds to take the trophy out of Europe and South America for the first time ever after Daniel Addo was sent off in the 37th minute for a late tackle on Alex Teixeira. Goalkeeper Daniel Aygei kept Ghana in the game earlier in extra-time with a point-blank save from Maicon, who had been teed-up 10 yards out by Alex Teixeira's cut-back. Douglas Costa twice went close in the additional 30 minutes, while Aygei was also called into action to save from Wellington Junior. Meanwhile, penalties were also needed to separate Hungary and Costa Rica in the third place playoff earlier in the day, but it was the European nation who eventually triumphed after the match ended 1-1 in 90 minutes. Despite being outplayed for the majority of the game, Costa Rica went ahead with nine minutes remaining when Marcos Urena was allowed to run at the Hungarian defence before cutting inside and firing a right-footed shot which left goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi with no chance. However, with the match entering injury time, Hungary were awarded a penalty when Jose Mena fouled Krisztian Nemeth in the box. Vladimir Koman made no mistake from the spot to take the match into a shoot-out. Liverpool's Gulacsi was the hero of the hour -- keeping out efforts from Cristian Gamboa, Esteban Luna and Adam Simon while Nemeth and Roland Varga both scored to hand Hungary a 2-0 victory on penalties.","Ghana become the first African country in history to win the U-20 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- In staging their Fourth of July fireworks show, authorities in Ocean City, Maryland, have faced challenges in recent years from Mother Nature. Fireworks light up the sky over Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the city's 2008 Fourth of July festivities. In 2005, thick fog veiled the celebration. Spectators couldn't see the detailed patterns and colors of the fiery blasts -- they only saw the clouds and haze get brighter. Thunderstorms erupted the next two years, delaying the show in 2006 and then forcing its cancellation in 2007. That year, storms brought winds that were just too strong. ""We start taking a hard look at the direction and speed of the wind when it gets to 15 or more knots [about 17 mph],"" said Ocean City Fire Marshal Sam Villani. ""At 20 knots, we consult the shooters ... to see if our perimeter is safe for the crowds. Twenty-knot [23 mph] sustained winds would probably be our cutoff."" As millions gather across the United States on Saturday to celebrate America's birthday with fireworks displays, fire officials will be watching weather forecasts and preparing to make sure revelers are as safe as possible. They often start by banning spectators from a safety zone, or perimeter, around the launch site to protect them from drifting embers that can get as hot as 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit. For that reason, fireworks launches over harbors, rivers and other bodies of water can often be larger in scale. ""For a venue like New York Harbor, it is common for [launch] barges to be located on the water, well away from land,"" said Guy Colonna, division manager with the National Fire Protection Agency. ""Even if the winds increase, it's possible...[for] the safety of the display not to be compromised."" Fireworks shows originating on land have stricter standards for the size of the perimeter, depending on wind speed, because spectators are generally closer to the explosives, Colonna said. Strong winds can make safety trickier. According to the Boston Globe, hundreds of people at a 2005 Fourth of July fireworks show in Canton, Massachusetts were accidentally showered with glowing embers when winds shifted about 10 minutes after the event began. High winds can even cancel a fireworks celebration. Rain, however, will not necessarily stop a show, said Philip Butler of Fireworks by Grucci, a Long Island, New York-based fireworks production company that has choreographed shows for presidential inaugurations and the Olympics. Fireworks don't extinguish in the rain, and as long as operators ""keep the powder dry,"" they will explode, Butler said. Moisture can cause them to change colors, though. ""A brilliant blue may appear as a royal blue,"" he said. Weather challenges are nothing new for Grucci. In preparing for a large show in Dubai, the production company once faced 105-degree heat and a sandstorm. ""They told us to simply kneel down and cover our heads with our capes and ride it out,"" Butler said. Ideal conditions for fireworks are calm winds, comfortable temperatures and clear night skies, Butler said. ""When the sky is black and clear, it's like a painter's canvas for us."" Some commonly asked questions about fireworks: . Do fireworks still work when it snows? Yes. For many New Year's Eve celebrations in cold-weather states, it's often snowing during fireworks shows. Fireworks production companies say the snow acts as a prism, reflecting and shifting the colors. What's the biggest danger that spectators face from fireworks? Statistics show the vast majority of fireworks-related injuries are caused by over-the-counter fireworks instead of burning debris from public fireworks celebrations. The risk of fireworks injury is 2Â½ times higher for children than for the general population, according to the National Fire Protection Agency. The biggest culprit? Sparklers. The National Fire Protection Agency advises against using your own fireworks. ""Leave it to the professionals.""

"Orlando, Florida (CNN)  -- A former astronaut who was accused of assaulting a romantic rival in the parking lot of the Orlando airport will avoid prison after pleading guilty to lesser charges as part of a plea agreement. Citing Lisa Marie Nowak's lack of a criminal history, Orange County Circuit Judge Marc Lubet sentenced her to a year of probation. She was given credit for the two days she served in the county jail after her arrest. Nowak, 46, must also perform 50 hours of community service and have no contact with the victim in the case, former Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman. She must also send Shipman a letter of apology within 10 days, ""a sincere letter of apology, not one of these vanilla things that I see from other defendants,"" Lubet told Nowak. ""It's been almost three years since the events took place that caused this nightmare for Ms. Shipman, and you are 100 percent responsible."" In addition, Nowak must complete an eight-hour anger management course within her first 30 days of probation, Lubet said. Nowak told the judge she had undergone counseling for 1Â½ years and the counseling is complete, so the judge said he would not order more. Lubet said he was treating Nowak as any defendant would be treated, saying he doubts any judge would send a defendant to prison on a first offense. Shipman delivered an emotional victim statement before Nowak's sentencing, telling the court she remains convinced Nowak planned to kill her. ""Shortly after I turned 30 years old, Lisa Nowak hunted me down and attacked me in a dark parking lot,"" she said, adding that she is ""still reeling from her vicious attack"" and attempting to piece her life back together. ""The world as I knew it before Lisa Nowak is gone,"" Shipman said. ""Every stranger I see is a potential attacker. Going out in public is exhausting."" She said she has undergone nearly three years of counseling, but suffers from nightmares, anxiety and health problems such as high blood pressure and chest pains because of the incident. Nowak initially was charged with attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm, battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon. If convicted, she could have faced a sentence of up to life in prison. Prosecutors accused Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from Houston, Texas, to Orlando -- wearing NASA diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following Shipman from the airport's baggage claim to the parking lot in February 2007. Nowak's attorney, Don Lykkebak, has denied that she wore the diapers. Nowak has said she went to the airport to talk to Shipman, who had begun dating Nowak's former love interest, Navy Cmdr. Bill Oefelein. But Shipman, in her comments Tuesday, called that claim ""at best, ridiculous,"" saying that Nowak, whom she did not know, had ample opportunity to talk to her, as she ""stealthily followed me for hours."" ""I'm a very friendly person, your honor,"" Shipman said, adding that she would have welcomed Nowak's company ""over some hot chocolate, while I was waiting for my suitcase to arrive."" She recounted the incident and her terror as she realized Nowak was following her in the dark parking lot, as she could hear the swishing of Nowak's pants as she walked. She said she sprinted to her car, and Nowak attempted to open the car door and beat on her window, then spun a tale of being a helpless traveler who was afraid of being in a dark parking lot. Shipman said she cracked her window, and Nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray. ""She blasted me with what felt like acid,"" Shipman said. ""... I stomped on the gas and wondered if there was a gun pointed at my head."" At a hearing in November 2007, Orlando Police Detective William Becton testified that in a search of Nowak's car, he found maps showing how to reach the airport and its layout, a buck knife and papers, including a letter Nowak appeared to have written to Oefelein's mother. He testified he found used and clean diapers in the car. Police previously had said they also found a BB gun, a steel mallet, a 4-inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle. Shipman said Tuesday she thought she had escaped a carjacking. ""I had no idea that a highly paid, high-ranking military officer had just attacked me."" When she found out she had been attacked by a ""sister in arms,"" she said, she was heartbroken. Shipman said the resulting media attention and scrutiny has placed additional stress on her and her family. Before sentencing, Nowak turned to Shipman and apologized. ""I am sincerely sorry for causing fear and misunderstanding and all of the intense public exposure that you have suffered,"" Nowak said. ""I hope very much that we can all move forward from this with privacy and peace."" Lubet said he accepted her apology as sincere, but in sentencing her he noted that he was certain her conviction would affect her Navy career and retirement. Still, the judge told Nowak, ""you brought this on yourself, and I don't have any sympathy for you in that respect."" Shipman has left the military and Oefelein has left the astronaut corps, and the two live in Anchorage, Alaska, where they run a company called Adventure Write as freelance writers and photographers. People.com reported in July the two were engaged. Lubet also ordered Nowak to stay away from Oefelein after Shipman alleged in her remarks she found a book with suggestive notes inside that Nowak had sent Oefelein after the incident despite a no-contact order. ""No books, no messages, no poems, nothing,"" Lubet said. ""It's not a problem,"" Nowak responded. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Lisa Marie Nowak, a former astronaut, accused of assaulting a romantic rival .

"(CNN) -- Authorities plan to ask new questions of the family at the center of the balloon drama that captured the world's attention Thursday, as a comment in a CNN interview and other concerns raised speculation that the incident may have been staged. Parents Mayumi and Richard Heene discuss the upheaval in their lives Friday on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""We feel it's incumbent on us as an agency to attempt to re-interview them and establish whether this is in fact a hoax or actual event,"" Larimer County Sheriff James Alderden said at a news conference Friday. ""We believe at this time that it's a real event."" Investigators with expertise in spotting deceptive behavior interviewed the family Thursday and believe they were not lying, Alderden said. His office is being flooded with calls and messages from people insisting it must be, and putting ""a lot of pressure"" on authorities to charge Richard and Mayumi Heene, he said. The sheriff's office said it was conducting background checks on the Heenes. A giant Mylar balloon took off from the backyard of the Heenes' northern Colorado home Thursday. The couple said they were terrified their 6-year-old son Falcon may have been on it. They couldn't find him. In audio from 911 calls released Friday, the parents sounded emotional and desperate. When the balloon finally landed, Falcon was not on board. Later, he came out from hiding in an attic over the home's garage. ""I'm feeling very, very grateful that Falcon is among us,"" Richard Heene told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Friday. ""We went through so many emotions yesterday."" On CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Thursday night, the Heene parents asked Falcon why he had not come out from hiding when they were calling for him. ""You guys said we did this for the show,"" he said.  Watch the boy's remarks Â» . The family chases storms and takes videos of some. The Heenes also were featured in March on the ABC program ""Wife Swap."" After the Hollywood gossip Web site TMZ.com reported that the Heenes had been ""pitching a reality show about the wacky family,"" one of the networks mentioned, TLC, which produces ""Jon and Kate plus 8,"" said ""they approached us months ago, and we passed."" Two other production companies, Reality Real and RDF, which produces ""Wife Swap,"" did not immediately respond to CNN's queries. They family had a video camera recording as the balloon took off Thursday. Alderden said that was because the family planned an experiment in which the balloon was to rise 20 feet off the ground. Richard Heene said his son was confused when he made the show remark. There were media assembled on the front lawn, asking all sorts of questions, and that's what Falcon was referring to, Heene said Friday morning. Heene, a meteorologist who takes his family along to chase storms, said he was concerned when the balloon took off because ""the project was pretty much down the tubes."" Then their son Bradford said he thought Falcon was inside, sparking the family's terror -- and the world's response, as people tuned in to live TV coverage of the balloon, which looked like a cross between a mushroom and a flying saucer. Alderden told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday that, based on reports that the parents ""took these children into potentially dangerous situations"" with tornado chases, the experimental balloons and other activities, it would be ""appropriate to involve child protection [services] to at least see what the family situation is and whether the children are in a safe condition."" Earlier, Alderden told reporters that his department has contacted the child protection officials but asked them not to contact the family until investigators have had a chance to re-interview them. Alderden, at Friday's news conference, said he did not believe Falcon could have been following instructions by going into hiding. ""I just can't see this particular boy being told go sit up there for five hours and be quiet. I just don't see that, as hyperactive as he is,"" the sheriff said. He also called it unlikely that the other two brothers, ages 8 and 10, would have pulled off such a hoax. If it were determined that the incident was a hoax, ""the only thing we have is them making a false report to authorities, which is a Class 3 misdemeanor,"" Alderden said. But, he said, authorities could seek to recoup the money spent. ""If there is criminal conduct, we certainly would seek restitution,"" he said. The balloon landed in a plowed wheat field, and the owner could seek compensation from the family, Alderden added. Asked whether the parents would not have checked the whereabouts of their three children before allowing the device to take off and why the system to tether it was not stronger, Alderden responded, ""You raise some very valid points that we are considering.""  Watch as home video shows the balloon take off Â» . Alderden also said his office had contacted an expert at Colorado State University during the incident to make sure that the dimensions of the balloon were adequate to handle a child of Falcon's weight, he said. The sheriff also sought to defend his department. Authorities had been at the house and had conducted searches for the boy three times during the incident. ""Obviously it wasn't as thorough as we would have liked it to be,"" he said, ""because the boy was hiding in the attic in the garage."" Investigators had seen the rafters in the garage, but there was no ladder to get up there. ""Our personnel just didn't think it possible that a 6-year-old boy would be able to get up into that space, so they didn't look there,"" he said. Falcon was not in a box as Alderden had originally reported. Instead, he had apparently crawled on a box in order to enter the attic area, Alderden said.  Watch how the events played out Â» . Despite numerous conspiracy theories flying around on the Internet, Alderden emphasized that authorities have not seen suspicious behavior by the Heene family. ""They appropriately expressed statements, nonverbal communication, body language and emotions during this event that were entirely consistent with the events that were taking place,"" he said. ""Certainly, people are free to speculate, they're free to be skeptical about it,"" Alderden added. ""But those of us in the law enforcement profession have to operate on facts and what we can prove.""","Boy's remark on CNN, ""We did this for the show,"" sparks speculation about stunt .

"Washington (CNN)  -- When Robert Byrd came to Congress from West Virginia, a postage stamp cost 3 cents and kids were clamoring for a new toy called Mr. Potato Head. On Wednesday, almost 57 years later, Byrd became the longest-serving member of Congress in history. Two days before he turns 92, the eloquent legislator known for his encyclopedic knowledge of Senate rules and history surpasses Carl T. Hayden, the Arizona Democrat who served a total of 20,773 days in the U.S. House and Senate. With his 20,774th day representing West Virginia -- six years in House and then nearly 51 years and counting in the Senate -- Byrd sets a record for longevity unlikely to be broken as the political climate turns toward term limits and growing public dissatisfaction with Congress. In a statement issued by his office, Byrd expressed his gratitude to ""the people of the great State of West Virginia"" for their long-standing confidence in him. His only regret, he said, was that his wife, Erma, who died in 2006, would not be with him. ""I know that she is looking down from the heavens smiling at me and saying congratulations my dear Robert -- but don't let it go to your head,"" Byrd's statement said. In a career representing the West Virginia coal-mining country from which he emerged, Byrd has cast more Senate votes (18,000-plus) and held more leadership positions (including two stints as majority leader) than any other senator. He has never lost an election. He was raised by an aunt and uncle after his mother died when he was a year old, and he did not graduate college until he received a degree in 1994 from Marshall University. In a sign of his Appalachian roots, Byrd was an avid fiddle player and appeared twice on the television program ""Hee Haw."" He gave up playing in the 1980s because of a tremor in his hands. His early political years displayed some of the deeply rooted racism of the American South. Byrd was a member of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan in the early 1940s, and later called it ""the most egregious mistake I've ever made."" In 1964, he voted against the Civil Rights Act pushed by Democratic President Lyndon Johnson. But Byrd later followed a more traditional Democratic path. An ardent foe of President George W. Bush's policies in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Byrd opposed creating the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 and called Bush ""dangerous, reckless and arrogant"" in February 2003, six weeks before the Iraq war started. Three months later, he criticized Bush's landing a jet on the USS Abraham Lincoln to signal the end of the Iraq war as ""flamboyant showmanship."" On June 12, 2006, Byrd became the longest serving senator in history, and was re-elected to his ninth consecutive Senate term five months later. Things have changed since he arrived in Washington as a new congressman in 1953, along with the first Eisenhower administration. Gas cost 20 cents a gallon then, and the average annual salary was less than $4,000. Ten presidents later, Byrd is known for his devotion to his state and constituents. ""His number one priority has always been the people of West Virginia,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, says in a statement on Byrd's Senate Web site. ""It has been a great example for all of us to never lose sight of the fact that you are elected by the people from your state and the people in your state should have first priority."" Byrd's statement marking Wednesday's achievement reflected that thinking. ""Although we are marking a longevity milestone, it has been the quality and dedication of service that has guided me over the years,"" Byrd said in his statement. ""I have strived to provide the people of West Virginia the best representation possible each of the 20,774 days which I have served in the Congress of the United States."" He thanked his constituents for their support and for ""putting their trust and faith in me."" Slowed by illness in recent years, including a six-week hospital stay this year because of a staph infection, Byrd concluded his statement with typical bravado. ""The only way for me to close on this historic day is to say that I look forward to serving you for the next 56 years and 320 days,"" he said. ""Thank you and may God bless you.""","Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- Increased fighting in Afghanistan has caused a drop in morale among U.S. soldiers while the reduction in combat in Iraq has bolstered morale, according to a new U.S. Army report released Friday. The report summarizes two surveys of U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan taken earlier this year. New statistics from the Army also show suicides are up in the entire service. Produced every two years by the Army's Mental Health Advisory Team, this latest report comes just over a week after a U.S. soldier went on a shooting rampage at a U.S. Army base in Texas and possibly just days or weeks from an announcement from the Obama administration to send more troops to Afghanistan, where fighting has gotten more intense in recent months. Authorities have not determined a motive for the shooting. The suspect, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan but had told his family that he wanted to get out of the military. ""Soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to face stress from multiple deployments into combat but report being more prepared for the stresses of deployments,"" Lt. Gen. Eric Schoomaker, the Army Surgeon General told reporters Friday. Not surprisingly, the report showed that soldiers with multiple deployments, three or four tours of duty to Iraq or Afghanistan, had much lower morale and more mental health problems than those soldiers who have one or two combat deployments. Increased time at home, however, resulted in improved morale among troops sent back to the field. The updated survey of soldiers in Afghanistan found post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression in soldiers at the same levels of the survey in 2007, but still about double that of the 2005 survey results: 21.4 percent in 2009, 23.4 percent for 2007 and 10.4 percent in 2005, according to the report. In Iraq, where the survey has been done every year, lower numbers were attributed to the decrease in combat action there. The 2009 numbers showed 13.3 percent of soldiers suffering from mental health problems, compared to 18.8 percent in 2007 and 22 percent in 2006. Army officials said that with the push of more than 20,000 additional troops into the Afghan theater of battle over the last few months, there have been fewer mental health professionals in the field to help. Army officials said the ration was about one mental health professional for every 1,120 soldiers. To combat the falling morale and lack of mental health professionals in the field, Army officials said the service needs to more than double the number of mental health providers and hopes to have at least 65 more of those providers in the field by December, making the ratio one for every 700 soldiers. The mental health assessment teams also conducted interviews with soldiers and found a drop in unit morale in Afghanistan to about half of what it was in 2007 and 2005, when about 10 percent surveyed gave top ratings to unit morale. In 2009, that number was 5.7 percent. The report also showed soldiers are seeing more difficulty at home with an increasing number reporting they are getting or considering getting divorced, according to the report. The overall report was based on almost 4,000 soldiers who filled out anonymous surveys in Iraq and Afghanistan between December 2008 and June 2009. In Iraq, 2,400 soldiers were randomly selected and the results were studied by a mental health assessment team in the combat zone. About 1,500 troops in Afghanistan took the survey, Army officials said. The survey was different from previous years when all types of soldiers were surveyed together. The 2009 survey questioned combat troops and support troops separately, though Army officials said there were few differences in the results. On Friday, the Army also released its latest suicide statistics. They show an increase in the number over this time last year. The Army reported 133 suspected suicides as of October; there were 115 as of October 2008. Of the 133, 90 have been confirmed, and 43 are pending confirmation, according to an Army press release. Last year the Army totaled 140 suicides in its ranks, the highest the service has recorded. ""Stigma continues to be one of the most difficult challenges we confront,"" said Brig. Gen. Colleen McGuire, the director of the Suicide Prevention Task Force for the Army. ""The more we educate our Army community about the need to get help, the need to get it early, and that a full recovery is often possible, the less stigma we'll see."" The Army has implemented a number of suicide prevention programs over the past year, including training, a suicide prevention task force and a day off official duties to focus on suicide prevention.","Report summarizes 2 surveys of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan taken this year .

"(CNN) -- For Morris Murenzi, a visit to his native Rwanda always includes attending a gacaca court -- a local tribunal of villagers set up to try suspects in a 1994 genocide that killed 800,000. The gacaca courts, as seen here in 2003, are inspired by old village tribunals used to settle disputes. At the proceedings, he sits with his countrymen. Some tearfully confront their attackers and testify against them, their scars from the genocide still visible. Others -- like him -- quietly listen, their emotional scars invisible. They wait and hope for answers about how their relatives died as a nine-member panel questions suspects. ""Some of the witnesses who ask questions are disfigured, others are disabled,"" said the Dallas, Texas, resident whose last gacaca trial was in Kigali two years ago. ""The attackers have no place to hide. They are forced to address what they have done to the victims."" Murenzi is one of thousands of people who attend gacaca courts all across Rwanda on any given day. Hearings are held in open fields in neighborhoods where the attacks occurred. There are no lawyers and no judges in robes. A panel of local villagers with no legal experience conducts the proceedings. ""For me, gacacas help me find closure and healing,"" Murenzi said. ""I am able to see up close how remorseful the attackers are. ... You never see that in real court."" Gacaca courts were introduced in the central African nation after the April 1994 genocide, which raged for 100 days. The victims were mostly from the Tutsi ethnic minority, who were targeted by Hutus over a rivalry that dates to colonial days. Some moderates from the Hutu majority who support Tutsis were also killed. Murenzi, a Tutsi from the capital, Kigali, lost most of his extended family in the genocide. During the attacks, he was in neighboring Uganda with his parents, where he attended school at the time, the 37-year-old said. ""My mom's sisters, brothers, my uncles, they were all killed and buried in mass graves,"" he said. The gacacas were originally formed to resolve minor disputes among villagers but were reinvented to hand out justice to the perpetrators of the genocide and help fast-track reconciliation efforts in the broken nation. ""You had about 130,000 people in jail. And there were many more outside,"" Rwandan President Paul Kagame said recently on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" The nation's justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal set up to try genocide suspects were overwhelmed, and handling all the cases in those courts would have taken hundreds of years, according to the president.  Watch Kagame justify gacacas Â» . ""If you went technically to try each one of them, as the law may suggest, then you would lose out on rebuilding a nation, on bringing people back together,"" he said. ""That's why we had to say, let's categorize responsibilities."" The leaders and masterminds of the genocide are tried in ordinary courts, and civilians who contributed to attacks or loss of life directly or indirectly go to gacacas, Kagame said. The tribunals are lacking and fraught with problems, critics say. ""We've had serious concerns about the gacaca process and whether it meets international fair trial standards,"" said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director for Human Rights Watch, which has offices in Rwanda. Some witnesses have been targeted for revenge after testifying, and due process falls short, Gagnon said, adding that the organization has suggested changes to the system to ensure basic human rights are met, but they have not been enforced. ""It is time for the process to end. And there needs to be a frank announcement on whether it has led to reconciliation,"" she said. Paul Rusesabagina, whose effort to save hundreds of Tutsis was featured in the 2004 movie ""Hotel Rwanda,"" calls gacacas ""the worst idea ever."" ""Gacaca traditionally means justice on the grass. Elders sitting on the grass, handing justice to someone who stole a neighbor's goat,"" Rusesabagina said. ""Judges are people who never went to school ... who do not know anything about law."" Today, this justice is dealing with people who have committed a genocide, which is a much bigger issue, he said. There have been calls to abolish the tribunals, which have tried about 1.5 million cases since they started in 2001, according to the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N. agency. The government in June postponed plans to close gacacas. Some analysts say the system has its advantages, by reducing congestion in prisons and allowing survivors to hear first-hand what happened to their loved ones. Murenzi said he does not have all the answers about his relatives' deaths, and he plans to attend more gacacas -- including during a trip to Rwanda at the end of the year. Despite the lack of information, he said, watching suspects struggle to come to terms with the attacks has brought an unusual form of comfort. ""They will never know peace. They have to live with the fact that they killed their neighbors for the rest of their lives,"" Murenzi said. ""While the survivors can move on, they (attackers) probably never will.""","Hearings held in open fields in neighborhoods where the attacks occurred.

"SICHUAN, China (CNN)  -- Li Yunxia wipes away tears as rescue crews dig through the ruins of a kindergarten class that has buried her only child -- a 5-year-old boy. Other parents wail as soldiers in blue masks trudge through the mud, hauling bodies from the rubble on stretchers. ""Children were screaming, but I couldn't hear my son's voice,"" she says, sobbing. This grim ritual repeated itself Thursday across southwestern China, as thousands of mothers and fathers await news about their sons and daughters.  Watch parents' anguished vigil Â» . The death toll from Monday's massive earthquake could be as high as 50,000, according to state-run media.  Map Â» . The grief is compounded in many cases by a Chinese policy that limits most couples to one child, a measure meant to control explosive population growth. As a result of the one-child policy, the quake -- already responsible for at least 15,000 deaths -- is producing another tragic aftershock: . Not only must thousands of parents suddenly cope with the loss of a child, but many must cope with the loss of their only child. China's population minister recently praised the one-child rule, which dates to 1979, saying it has prevented 400 million children from being born. Some wealthy families ignore the order, have more children and pay a $1,000 fine. In rural areas -- like earthquake-devastated Sichuan province -- families can petition for an additional child, but there's no guarantee the authorities will approve the request -- they usually don't. That reality has cast parents like Li into an agonizing limbo -- waiting to discover whether their only child is alive or dead. Thousands of children were in class when the temblor hit Monday afternoon. Many of their schools collapsed on top of them. In Dujiangyan City, more than 300 students were feared dead when Juyuan Middle School collapsed with 900 students inside. A similar number died at the city's Xiang'e Middle School.  See images and video from the quake zone Â» . Now parents cluster outside collapsed school buildings, held back by soldiers in some cases as rescue crews search for signs of life.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Kandi Burruss, the newest cast member of the reality show ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"" was mourning the death Saturday of her fiancÃ©, who died after a fistfight the night before. Kandi Burruss, at right with co-star NeNe Leakes, appeared at the BET Awards in June. The fiancÃ©, 34-year-old Ashley ""A.J."" Jewell, also appeared on the show. A spokeswoman for Burruss said the actress was ""devastated"" by the news. ""She has no statement to make at this time and asks for privacy,"" Tresa Sanders said. She said the two planned to marry, even though the relationship had ups and downs. In late August, Burruss told WVEE Radio in Atlanta, ""We're on hiatus,"" and she told Essence.com last month that the two were taking a break from each other. Police said they contacted Burruss after Jewell's death. Jewell and another man fought Friday night in the parking lot of the Atlanta strip club Body Tap, police spokesman Officer James Polite said. Jewell was taken to a hospital, where he died of blunt force trauma to the head, Polite said. Fredrick Richardson was arrested on a charge of voluntary manslaughter after witnesses identified him and he was interviewed by police. He was treated at a hospital. Police tentatively described the men as club managers, although Jewell claimed on Twitter that he owned the establishment. Polite said police don't know why the fight started. Sanders said Burruss was doubly saddened because she is mourning the death of her uncle, Ralph Leslie, whose funeral is Saturday.

"London (CNN) -- Debate is rife in Australian political circles about whether carbon trading is the way forward for climate change abatement. Carbon trading is said to be one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is looking to introduce a mandatory carbon trading system by 2010 which will cap the amount of pollution industry can release. The proposed Australian system will be similar to the European Union emission trading system which was established in 2005. With Phase 1 of the European system complete, there are a few lessons about carbon trading that Australia -- and other countries looking to go down this path -- could benefit from. So what is carbon trading? Carbon trading -- also known as ""cap and trade"" -- is a system designed to cut the carbon emissions which contribute to global warming. Generally in a market-based cap and trade system, a central authority -- such as a government or international body -- sets a limit on the amount of carbon which can be emitted and then divides this amount into units which are allocated to different groups. These units can then be traded as any commodity would. Carbon trading can occur both between countries and amongst industries within countries. A second approach to carbon trading involves a country or business generating carbon credits by investing in ""green"" projects -- usually in developing countries -- that are said to reduce emissions. Why is it necessary? According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) there is unequivocal evidence that human activities have contributed to a gradual warming of the planet which has resulted in a change in climate. The IPCC report provides scientific evidence of change including to the duration of seasons, rainfall patterns and an increased frequency of extreme weather events. Industrialization is recognized as a key factor in the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere and according to the IPCC the world has warmed by an average of 0.74Â°C in the past 100 years. The IPCC predicts that if GHG emissions continue to rise at their current rate, this century will see a further 3Â°C rise in the average world temperature. While the consensus of the scientific community (via the IPCC) is that action must be taken to avert the worst impacts of climate change, economic arguments about the cost of climate change abatement -- advanced by countries like the U.S. and at one time Australia -- have in the past proved an impediment to action. A carbon trading system is said to be one way that countries can look to make greenhouse gas emissions cuts with minimal economic impact. Do you think carbon trading is the way to reduce greenhouse emissions? What trading systems exist? Established in 2005, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is the largest multi-national, multi-sector CO2 trading system in the world. The ultimate aim of the system is to ensure that EU Member States are compliant with their Kyoto Protocol commitments and to do this the most energy-intensive industries are allocated carbon permits by Member States which allow them to emit a certain amount of CO2. If these companies want to emit more CO2 than their permits allow for, they are able to buy them from more efficient companies with spare permits. The EU ETS takes in around 12,000 installations which account for around 50 percent of EU greenhouse gas emissions from industries such as power, steel and cement manufacture. According the World Bank, the EU ETS contributed $50 billion of the $64 billion traded in the carbon market in 2007. The second largest carbon trading system exists under the United Nations Kyoto Protocol. The Protocol -- which sets binding emission targets for 37 industrialized countries -- permits emissions trading in order to help countries meet their agreed upon targets. Countries have agreed to an average 5 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions, compared to 1990 levels, by 2012 and carbon trading is one way to meet this quota. By December 2008, the EU ETS will link up with the UN trading system to create a more global scheme. The Clean Development Mechanism is a further carbon trading mechanism of the Protocol which allows industrialized nations to claim emission credits from investment in clean technologies which will ""offset"" carbon in developing countries. Developed nations can also finance emission reduction projects in developing countries through Joint Implementation in exchange for emission credits. New Zealand has established a mandatory carbon trading system this year and Australia has also committed to expanding the pioneering New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme to a national market by 2010. New mandatory systems are being considered for Japan and Canada. Voluntary carbon markets also exist, with the Chicago Climate Exchange one of the more established ones. What do permits cost? The cost of a carbon permit is dictated by the market forces of supply and demand. In 2007, one European Union Allocation (for one ton of carbon) was trading at $30 to $35. What industries are subject to trading? Under mandatory schemes like the EU ETS, it's the most energy-intensive industries within Member States which are subject to carbon trading. This includes industries like power installations, steel and cement manufacture and the construction industry. The commercial aviation industry -- which accounts for 3 percent of EU emissions -- could be brought into the EU ETS by 2011. Currently personal or household emissions and the public sector and transport industry emissions are not included in any carbon trading system. Has emissions trading been successful? Yes and no. The introduction of mandatory systems which cap emissions like the EU ETS is a step in the right direction for trying to cut emissions without a major cost to business. However, critics such as Carbon Trade Watch argue that the current carbon trade systems are flawed because there is a tendency for the biggest polluters to be over-allocated permits. This was clearly evident with Phase 1 of the EU ETS when the market virtually collapsed in 2006 because too many allowances were allocated. Market analyst Franck Schuttellaar estimated that the United Kingdom's most polluting companies made windfall profits of around $1.7 billion as a direct result of generous carbon credit allocation under the EU ETS. Questions have also been raised about whether carbon trading systems actually reduce GHG emissions. Independent UK think-tank Open Europe reported that between 2005 and 2006 emissions from industries covered by the ETS actually rose in UK by 3.6 percent and by 0.8 percent across the whole of Europe. Auctioning off carbon credits at the outset -- rather that simply allocating credits to business for free -- is one way that has been proposed to help the system make a real impact on emissions. Certainly, increasing the scarcity of carbon credits would help ensure that businesses commit to genuine low-carbon alternatives. While carbon emissions account for around 70 percent of greenhouse gases, they are not the sole cause of climate change and it would seem a safer bet to reinforce a carbon trading system with other legislative measures aimed at reducing emissions.","Carbon trading is said to be one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

"(CNN) -- One hundred twenty African refugees -- most of them fleeing war-torn Somalia -- were forced overboard at gunpoint off the coast of Yemen, leaving at least 26 dead and 20 missing, the United Nations' refugee agency said Wednesday. A Somali refugee walks past the United Nations-donated tents at a refugee camp west of Aden. Seventy-four survivors made it to the beach Tuesday and were taken to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees center in Ahwar, Yemen, according to UNHCR. Some told the United Nations that they were waiting on their boat for a smaller vessel to take them ashore when the smugglers operating the boat forced them overboard. Some were pushed and beaten, and others were shot and killed, for not complying, they said. The smaller boat never arrived, they said. Heavy fighting in Somalia's capital and a widespread drought has led to a dramatic increase in Somalis making the sometimes deadly journey by sea to Yemen, according to UNHCR. Nearly 26,000 refugees have arrived on Yemen's shores this year from the Horn of Africa -- almost three times the number of refugees to make the perilous journey across the Gulf of Aden last year, according to UNHCR. Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship and war because of its proximity. It is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country. New smuggling routes, including some based out of Djibouti -- which lies north of Somalia and is much closer to Yemen -- have also led to the increase in refugees, according to the UNHCR. Refugees pay as much as $150 to get to Yemen on small fastboats, while others pay between $50 and $70 for a ride on larger and much slower vessels, the agency said. Earlier this year, Yemen's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline in an attempt to deter the smugglers. Some of the smuggling boats are seized by Yemen's coast guard and given to Somali fishermen who suffered losses in the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. As part of a $19 million operation, UNHCR operates shelters and reception centers for the refugees in Yemen and has increased its efforts to discourage people from making the illegal crossing to Yemen. It has also sponsored training programs for coast guard personnel and other officials.","74 survivors made it to the beach and were taken to Ahwar, Yemen .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Four senators pushed for a bill Wednesday to ban texting while driving, a day after a study found that drivers who text while on the road are much more likely to have an accident than undistracted drivers. A law that went into effect January 1 in California makes it illegal to send text messages while driving. Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-New York; Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey; Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana; and Kay Hagan, D-North Carolina, unveiled the ALERT Act, which would ban truck and car drivers and operators of mass transit from texting while driving. The proposed legislation would prohibit any driver from sending text or e-mail messages while driving a vehicle, said an earlier news release from the senators. If the bill passes, the Department of Transportation would set the minimum standards for compliance. States that do not enact text-banning laws within two years of the bill's passage could lose 25 percent of their federal highway funds, Schumer said in a news conference announcing the legislation. The noncompliant states could recuperate that money once they meet the text-banning standards, Schumer said. CTIA, a cellular phone industry group, said that it supports legislation that addresses text messaging while driving. ""CTIA and our member companies continue to believe text messaging while driving is incompatible with safe driving,"" said a statement on CTIA's Web site. Fourteen states, including the home states of three of the bill's sponsors, and the District of Columbia already have laws barring texting while driving: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Washington.  Interactive map: See state-by-state policies on distracted driving Â» . New York does not ban texting while driving but has barred the use of handheld phones while driving, according to the Governor's Highway Safety Association. Schumer said New York's legislature has sent Gov. David Paterson a bill to ban texting as well. ""The legislation will send an important message to drivers across the country: Get your hands off the cell phone and back on the wheel,"" Schumer said. The senators cited a Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study that found that truck drivers who texted while driving were 23 times more likely to crash or get into a near-accident than undistracted drivers. Watch more on the dangers of driving and texting . When compared with dialing, talking, listening or reaching for an electronic device, texting posed the greatest accident risk, the study found. It attributed the increased risk to the almost five seconds it found that the driver's eyes were off the roadway while texting, said Rich Hanowski, the director of the Center for Truck and Bus Safety at the transportation institute. ""Not having [a cell phone] in your hand while driving could be the difference between life and death,"" Menendez said. In September, a commuter train engineer missed a stop signal while trading text messages with a friend, leading to a collision with a freight train that killed 25 people in California, according to federal investigators. The accident also injured 101 people. In May, 62 people were injured when one trolley struck another in Boston, Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said. In July, the operator of one trolley was charged with gross negligence after he admitted to texting seconds before the accident with the other trolley, according to the Suffolk County district attorney and a National Transportation Safety Board official. CNN Radio's John Lisk contributed to this report.","14 states and the District of Columbia have banned texting while driving .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Don't confuse Katey Sagal for Peg Bundy -- it's a common mistake. Katey Sagal says being a mother has been her greatest teacher -- for all her roles. While her infamous alter ego was uneducated, Katey is thoughtful and well-spoken; Peg's fashion is time-warped (hello, bouffant!), Katey's is earthy; for every ounce of laziness in Peg's body, Katey has a multitasking one to match. It may have taken years for the actress to shake her TV counterpart, but watch Katey as fierce matriarch Gemma Morrow on FX's motorcycle drama ""Sons of Anarchy"" (which was released on DVD Tuesday), and you'll start to wonder, ""Peg who?"" Rachel Bertsche: You're known for playing three very different mothers -- ""Married with Children's"" Peg Bundy, Kate from ""8 Simple Rules"" and now Gemma. Plus, you have three kids of your own, two teenagers and a 2 1/2-year-old. Given all that on- and off-screen mothering experience, is there any universal quality that you would say all moms have? Katey Sagal: Being a mother has been my greatest teacher and also the most self-sacrificing thing I've ever done. I've never loved anybody the way I love my children. It's an experience I was surprised by. You have your boyfriend, your husband, your friends, but it's a different thing. It's deeper, and it's a fantastic -- and risky -- commitment to love that deeply. I think the characters I've played all have that quality, even Peg Bundy. She was devoted and loyal to her children in her own wacky way. But Gemma is intensely dedicated to her family and would do anything to protect her son and her extended family, which is the club. In my personal life, I don't know that I would go to the lengths for my kids that Gemma does, but close. Bertsche: You were Peg Bundy before you were actually a mom. Once you had your first child, id having firsthand experience change the way you played her? Sagal: Well, I've always been a maternal type, but yes, everything was different once I had kids. Your whole perspective on the world changes -- I love how I wasn't so self-obsessed anymore! I can't say my characterizations of Peggy necessarily changed much. I just understood more what I was doing. Bertsche: You mentioned your husband, Kurt Sutter, who is also the creator of your show. What's it like to mix family with business? Sagal: Most of the time it's super great. There are moments when it's not, of course, but most of the time it's nice because we actually get to see each other. His job is intense, so he doesn't get a day like I have today where he can stay home from work. When I'm there, we can sometimes have lunch together, stuff like that. The hard part gets to be like ""OK, maybe we should talk about something else."" It becomes the constant topic of conversation, the show and the kids, and we have to make a conscious effort to say, ""Let's not talk about it tonight."" Bertsche: People used to say that women of ""a certain age"" -- over 40 -- couldn't find any roles in Hollywood. That's certainly not true anymore, especially on cable, and you might be playing one of the toughest women out there. Why do think that has changed? Sagal: I don't know why it's changed, but I'm really grateful it has. Maybe it has to do with the fact that we're all living longer and suddenly it's okay to get older. Maybe there's a broader audience for these characters. The stories you can tell about older women are deeper. Plus, cable has opened up enormous possibilities. In feature films, you're still lucky if you're not the girlfriend or the wife. But I just read yesterday that Dianne Keaton is going to be on television now, she's doing a series with HBO, so TV is where our stories are being told. Bertsche: Gemma's a pretty controversial character. How do you feel about her? Sagal: I really like her. I like that she's flawed but she doesn't think that she is. She's survived a lot, and people like that tend to live in a lot of denial. She knows how to get through life in her way, and she doesn't question it. It's just, ""This is how it is."" For instance, I don't think Gemma's ever been to therapy. She's not that girl. What you see is what you get. Bertsche: What's on tap for her this season? Sagal: Something very dark happens. The club is going to go through some turmoil -- when you live an outlaw lifestyle, that's the risk you take. As my husband says, this season is all about loyalties. Henry Rollins and Adam Arkin are on the show this year, and they ... well, I don't want to say too much, but they're not really good guys. Bertsche: I promised a co-worker I'd ask you about ""Lost."" She's dying to know if your character, Helen, is really dead. Even though we saw the grave, she doesn't believe it's the full story. Got anything on that? Sagal: I was just reading an article this morning at the gym about how they were going to bring back people who were dead on ""Lost,"" and they didn't mention me! Nobody tells me anything. I'm always thinking that Helen should come back and show up on the island, but as of today, no one's sent me a plane ticket to Hawaii. So I don't think it's going to happen, but I don't know.

"KAMPALA, Uganda (CNN) -- Gunshots rang out in Uganda's capital Saturday in a fresh burst of unrest after loyalists of a traditional kingdom battled with government forces for a third day. Residents of the Kasubi suburb, west of Kampala, try to flee from violence as a soldier takes photos. Local media reports put the death toll at 13 since the rioting started, but attempts by CNN to confirm with local authorities were unsuccessful. An uneasy calm had swept over Kampala early in the day as police and the army patrolled the city in military convoys. By midafternoon, witnesses reported gunshots and isolated cases of riots. The unrest Saturday started after rumors circulated by text messages that the king of the Buganda kingdom had been detained, said Judith Nabakooba, a police spokeswoman. But a Buganda kingdom official refuted the rumor. ""It is not true -- the king has not been arrested, "" David Mpanga said. Tensions between the Buganda kingdom -- headed by King Ronald Mutebi II -- and President Yoweri Museveni have intensified in recent years. The two sides spar over land, sovereignty and political power. Kings in the east African nation are limited to a ceremonial role overseeing traditional and cultural affairs. Museveni has accused the Buganda kingdom, which is made of of Bagandans, of receiving foreign funding to carry out a hate campaign against the government. Bagandans are the dominant ethnicity and one of four ancient kingdoms in the nation. Violence flared Thursday when the government said it would not allow the Buganda king to travel to an area inhabited by a renegade rival group. The president said he tried to contact the king to discuss the issue as ""mature people,"" but he could not reach him by phone. After the travel ban, young Bagandans took the streets, stealing ammunition from a police station and confronting officers, whom they accused of harassment. Police and army officers were injured, and at least four people were killed, the nation's police chief, Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura said Friday. Rioters also burned tires and cars, set buildings on fire and looted stores, according to witnesses. The streets in the capital were strewn with debris Saturday, including torched cars and burned tires. ""Soldiers are walking in a single file, waiting for rioters and ready to confront them,"" said Allan Mugabi, a resident of Kampala. Journalist Samson Ntale contributed to this report .","Local media put death toll from riots at 13, CNN unable to confirm figure .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A man brutally beaten in New York City was targeted because he is openly gay, the New York Police Department said Monday.

No further details where available about the attack. Price is being treated at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens, where ""he is in fair condition and his vital signs are stable,"" said hospital spokeswoman Camela Morrissey. Police arrested Daniel Aleman, 26, and charged him with assault and aggravated assault as a hate crime. ""When someone is attacked for being who they are, and for being proud of who they are, there is no other explanation for that attack than hatred and bigotry,"" said New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, the first openly gay speaker of the city council.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Cool suit? Check. Edgy spectacles? Check. Warm vocal chords? Check. Gary Go uses iPhone apps to help him compose new material -- and provide instant accompaniment. Instrument? Powering up iPhone ... These days, British singer Gary Go might reach for his iPhone before his keyboard when hammering out a tune. He says applications such as Chordica and Beatmaker allow him to compose material and provide instant accompaniment for those spontaneous moments when he feels the need for a good sing (during the interview, Go broke into song every five minutes). Go's gadget of choice even doubled as a ""fifth member of the band"" during his July performance in front of 70,000 at London's Wembley Stadium.

"(CNN) -- Nanci Griffith wanted to look on the bright side. Nanci Griffith, who says she's ""fed up with negativity,"" was revitalized by the election of Barack Obama. And who could blame her? In the past decade, Griffith -- perhaps best known for her Grammy-winning 1993 album, ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"" -- had faced a political climate she didn't agree with, as well as recovery from thyroid and breast cancer, which she was diagnosed with in the late '90s. Songwriting had become a struggle for the singer with the gentle, crystalline voice. ""It was ... horrific,"" she said simply. However, with her latest album, ""The Loving Kind"" (Rounder), Griffith is as focused and passionate as she has been in years. Sparked by the changes in her life and American politics, she said, music has been vital to her personal resurgence. ""It was nice to focus on things outside of my body. Music has always done that for me,"" she said. Describing herself as someone who was ""fed up with negativity,"" Griffith was equally inspired by her fellow countrymen. ""[The] American people will not let this country collapse,"" she said. The idea motivated her to look at her country's dark path of injustice not so long ago, stories that worked their way into her songwriting. ""In some ways, I'm just a journalist. I [want] my audience to hear these stories,"" she said. CNN spoke with Griffith from her home in Nashville, Tennessee. CNN: Being a folk singer and your views being what they are, was it tougher or maybe easier to write songs from 2000 to 2008? Nanci Griffith: It was very difficult for me. I was hurt by the direction my country was going in. And then, after [the 2008 election], everything came spilling out. Things came along like the Mildred and Richard Loving case (""The Loving Kind""), where Mildred died, and I read her obituary. [The Lovings were a couple whose interracial marriage was against the law in Virginia at the time.] That was such an inspiration. ... Just wondering why I never knew about this and how important that case is currently with equality in marriage. Little things. Bit by bit, my heart started to open up again, and I could write! CNN: Had you ever gone through that before? Griffith: No, never in my life. I've always been a very prolific writer. CNN: Now, what about writing in the age of Obama? Griffith: (laughs) It feels great! People may be down on their luck, financially. But I see so much optimism about the direction of the country and [general] openness. CNN: Now, in addition to ""The Loving Kind,"" there are other songs based on actual events on this record. Tell me about ""Not Innocent Enough."" Griffith: That's based on Philip Workman's case in Memphis [Tennessee]. He was robbing a Wendy's -- was a heroin addict -- and police came in, and an officer was killed. Now, Workman didn't kill him; it was friendly fire. Workman was convicted anyway and executed. I'm a total abolitionist when it comes to the death penalty, but this case really stunned me, because I feel like this country has evolved enough to where we shouldn't have to live with the death penalty. CNN: Is it hard as a writer/musician to inhabit those songs, knowing that they are actual events? Griffith: Not really. I feel like, in some ways, I'm just a journalist. I don't express my opinion [in the songs], necessarily. But it's important to me that my audience hear these stories. I want as many people to know about Loving v. Virginia as possible. CNN: Do you feel like it's a more palatable way to become aware of a story like that when a song is attached to it? Griffith: I do. I've been informed many times through music. Pete Seeger, Odetta, Dave Van Ronk, Bruce Springsteen ... so many folk songwriters. It's all around you. CNN: The song ""Still Life"" -- I suspect that's about President George W. Bush? Griffith: It's about people like him. This country is full of them, and especially my home state of Texas. It's a [perspective on] people who go through life getting away with everything. CNN: Do you feel a sense of vindication with President Obama's election, or at least a sense that things are moving in a direction you're in favor of? Griffith: I hope so. Right now, he is my hero. So is his wife. CNN: What in your past steered you into a topical songwriter? Griffith: I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view ... and things that informed me. CNN: Is there a different process of writing those topical songs versus a song like ""Up Against the Rain,"" which is clearly more personal? Griffith: There is a burden to writing [those topical songs]: You better have your facts straight. When you're writing a personal song like ""Rain,"" it's straight from your heart and seems to just flow. CNN: ""Sing"" seems like it would fit that description. Does that song sum up your life in a way? Griffith: Many have asked that, but I was actually inspired to write that by watching an interview with Shania Twain where she said it would not have mattered if she remained a lounge act for her whole career. It's not something you choose. It's just what you do.","Nanci Griffith's new album is ""The Loving Kind""

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- The Turkish military said Friday it is weighing bids from American, Russian and Chinese defense contractors as it seeks to buy at least $1 billion worth of long-range missile defense systems. The Turkish military says a missile defense deal could include U.S. Patriot missile systems. Among the missile systems Turkey is considering are U.S. Patriot missile systems, the military said. ""We will purchase four batteries,"" Turkish armed forces spokesman Metin Gurak announced at a weekly press briefing in the Turkish capital, according to the state news agency, Anatolian. ""The actual figure will be determined during the bidding process, but the cost is expected to be around $1 billion."" The news contradicts earlier reports in the Turkish and American media that the Turkish military was considering purchasing as much as $7.8 billion worth of Patriot missiles from the United States. Turkish diplomats and military commanders have denied speculation that the Patriots could be used as part of U.S.-backed missile defense shield against its eastern neighbor, Iran. ""It is wrong to draw links between the Patriot and Iran,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told CNN's sister network, CNN Turk, Friday morning. ""We neither have a perception of threat from any of the neighboring countries, nor have any military or security related preparation against them."" Thursday, the Obama administration announced it was scrapping a missile defense program for Eastern Europe, after years of angry objections from Russia. The White House has said the program was aimed at protecting allies from Iran, not from Russia.  Read the story . Russia is Turkey's largest trading partner. Meanwhile, relations have warmed considerably between the Iranians and the Turks in recent years. The Turkish government is putting itself forward as a neutral party, offering to host talks between Iran and the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China on Iran's controversial nuclear program. But Turkey is also a member of the NATO military alliance, and it has long had close military ties with Washington. During the first Gulf War, Patriot missile batteries were temporarily stationed on Turkish territory. Turkish officials say the missile defense batteries it wants to buy would be part of a larger, long-term program to modernize the country's military. Prominent Turkish intellectuals have questioned the purchase. ""Does Turkey really need these missiles?"" asked Lale Kemal, a columnist who writes about military affairs for Turkey's Zaman newspaper. ""Turkish military acquisition projects are not going through parliamentary or government scrutiny. We don't have a transparent military procurement system. So how can I or anyone say that Turkey needs them?""

"(CNN) -- Elmo and Gordon want you to wash your hands so you don't catch the flu. Smokey Bear, the Ad Council's most famous icon, has moved from 1940s posters to his own Facebook page. The ""Sesame Street"" stalwarts star in a series of public service announcements to teach children healthy habits in the face of the H1N1 flu virus. The Muppet and the man (actor Roscoe Orman) are the latest in a long line of characters -- human and not -- to star in public service announcements co-sponsored by the Advertising Council. The Ad Council, the charitable arm of the advertising industry, employs the same top-flight talent that creates ads for Budweiser, Coca-Cola and other familiar brands.  Watch Elmo and Gordon give the pitch Â» . Growing beyond its early ""Buy War Bonds"" posters and Smokey TV spots, today's Advertising Council is moving into social media ""in a very big way,"" said Peggy Conlon, the organization's CEO. ""There's all kinds of ways the Advertising Council finds its target audience on the web,"" she said, noting that the group has its own YouTube channel. A marketing executive endorses the approach. ""If your target is young people, television really doesn't make a lot of sense now if they're spending hours on the Internet, hours in social media,"" said Ben Kunz, director of strategic planning for Mediassociates, a media planning and Internet strategy firm. ""You need to find a way to reach them in the media that they consume."" The ""holy grail"" is to go viral, as people pass the message around because they like it or think it's important, Kunz said. A gory, four-minute British PSA on the dangers of texting while driving has received nearly 600,000 views on YouTube in less than two weeks, fueled in part by Facebook and Twitter links.  Watch how the PSA has changed minds Â» . ""If you can leverage these new human networks using mobile and Facebook and Twitter and blogs to disseminate your message, that's the real home run,"" he said. ""But the only way to do that is to give people a real reason to become engaged."" One campaign that tries to do that is called Boost Up, aimed at encouraging students to complete high school. Louis Caldera, who at the time was secretary of the Army, initiated the project with a call to the Ad Council because of a lack of qualified recruits. ""There was a disconnect between the societal message that said, 'Go to college,' and [the Army's] message, which said, 'Don't go to college, join the military,'"" Caldera, a West Point alumnus, told CNN. Caldera wanted people to think of the Army as a leader in education issues, not an alternative to schooling, and he sought the Ad Council's help. ""We absolutely did not want people to think this was about recruiting,"" he said. The council put together a campaign intended for all students, with a particular goal of reaching Latinos, for whom dropout rates are higher than for other groups. ""It really encourages people -- both adults and their peers -- to give these kids the encouragement that they need to really reach within themselves and find the personal resolve that they need to overcome life's difficulties and graduate from high school,"" Conlon said. ""It's a really smart campaign. I think it's very genuine, and it resonates really well with kids."" Although dropout rates generally and among Latinos remain high, ""I think this is making a contribution to creating the environment in which more students can be successful,"" said Caldera, now a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank. President Obama will appear in the latest series of Boost Up PSAs, to begin airing next week. The Ad Council and its partners measure a campaign's success by how much donated media a campaign attracts. Media outlets will run an ad more if it helps them retain audiences, Conlon said. The Ad Council receives $1.8 billion a year in donated media, she said.  Watch some notable Ad Council PSAs Â» . The council also measures response to phone numbers or Web sites promoted in the ads and tracks awareness through before-and-after surveys, Conlon said. ""We can watch the needle move over time,"" she said. ""It's very scientific; it's very empirical."" But not every campaign is a home run, Conlon admitted. ""We kind of laugh about the Gerald Ford 'Whip Inflation Now' with his big WIN buttons,"" she said. ""The Advertising Council did that campaign, and for many reasons that were mostly cultural, it completely bombed."" And then there are those campaigns that get mixed reviews. ""The 'Just Say No' campaign was probably the biggest success,"" Kunz said. ""I think it led to something like the creation of 5,000 clubs around the country, and there was a definite decline in drug use."" Conlon laughed. ""It was a terrible campaign,"" she said. ""And the reason was not because we shouldn't be telling young people not to use drugs, but it's just not as simple as that. It stripped it down to such a simplistic message that it had terrible reaction on the part of kids."" Campaigns are about educating the public on the facts of an issue, Conlon said. ""You have to get their attention, and that's where the creativity comes in,"" Conlon said. ""It can't be just lecturing or just exposing the message to people. In this cluttered media environment, you really have to have something that breaks through."" One creative spot that has broken through on an emotional level depicts a grown man practicing cheerleading moves on a sidewalk. The humorous ad promotes fathers' involvement in their children's lives. ""Being a good dad sometimes requires shamelessness,"" said Bill Ludwig, creative director at the Campbell Ewald ad agency in Detroit, Michigan, which created the spot. ""The idea is that the smallest moments can have the biggest impact on a child's life. Just spend a little time with your kid."" The father-daughter message touched Facebook user Jessica Gonzales, a graduate student in San Diego, California. ""There's plenty of ads telling us what to buy, how to look, etc., but few remind us how to just be ... and how to be good to one another,"" Gonzales said. ""The ad's tagline is 'Take time to be a dad,' but that message could be easily translated to so many other roles: Take time to be a friend, a mentor, a positive influence."" That's the kind of response the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is hoping to get from co-sponsoring the ""Sesame Street"" flu campaign. ""We are doing everything we can to protect public health and teach children how they can stay healthy and safe,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ""Elmo, Gordon, Sesame Workshop and the Ad Council are delivering an important message to our kids.""","Elmo and Gordon of ""Sesame Street"" join long line of public service spot stars .

"(CNN) -- Ford is the only major U.S. carmaker that is getting by without U.S. taxpayer money. Mark Fields of Ford says consumer confidence is key to getting the auto industry back on track. GM and Chrysler, on the other hand, have been told the Obama administration they will receive operating funds for several weeks in return for undergoing significant restructuring. Mark Fields, executive vice president of Ford, spoke to CNN's Kiran Chetry Tuesday on ""American Morning"" about the company's plans and whether it will be able to continue without financial aid from the government. Kiran Chetry: So, Mark, your company is the one that's gotten by without federal money. Will you be able to continue that? Mark Fields: Well, our position hasn't changed. We're in a different position than some of our competitors, and we're not seeking emergency taxpayer assistance. Chetry: Right, but I'm saying in the future, how are you guys guaranteeing that you won't need to go to the federal government like your two competitors have and ask for some help? Fields: Well, we're going to continue executing our plan, which really involves decisive actions around transforming the business, but also bringing great high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles into the marketplace. And we've been working this plan over the last three years, and we've been making progress. Clearly it's a tough time in the economy, but we are really focused on bringing these great cars and trucks to customers, getting our cost structure right. We've come to new agreements with our UAW partners. We're working through reducing our debt. So we're going to continue working through that, and we don't expect to take taxpayer assistance from the emergency funds.  Watch Fields discuss Ford's future Â» . Chetry: You say it's been tough times, and certainly for you guys, it has -- 2008 the worst annual loss in Ford's 105-year history. You guys can restructure. You can work out new deals with the unions. But in the end, if people aren't buying cars or they can't get credit, how do you remain viable? Fields: Well, consumer confidence is the biggest issue in the marketplace right now. The good news is, our new cars and trucks that are coming into the marketplace are being well-received. Our retail market share has been up three of the last four months. We expect the month of March our retail share to be up again. But getting that consumer confidence is really important. And that's why today we're announcing our Ford advantage plan, and it's for any customer who buys a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury product, when they come into the showroom and buy their product, if that customer loses their position, we will pay their car payments up to 12 months while they're unemployed, to give them that peace of mind. Post your comments on AMfix . Chetry: You're also offering some zero percent financing. I'm sure that you're trying to do that as well because of the frozen credit in a lot of instances. I want to get your take on this, though. President Obama announced yesterday he's giving ... Chrysler a month, basically, to submit a reorganization plan that the administration finds acceptable. The Obama administration also of course forced General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner out. Was that the right move, in your opinion? Fields: Well, what we are supportive of is that the president is committed to a vibrant U.S. auto industry. As we mentioned, Ford is in a different position. We're not asking for the emergency taxpayer assistance. But what we are focusing on is taking decisive action to streamline our business, but more importantly win new customers with the great set of products we're going -- we're coming out with over the next couple of months. Chetry: You know, there is some unprecedented government intervention going on right now in the U.S. auto industry at your competitors. They're getting billions of dollars in taxpayer money. They're being forced to restructure, as we talked about. They actually were forced to fire their CEO. And right now, it seems that, you know, they're on a different level than you guys are. Is there some sense that perhaps there's an unfair advantage, that they're getting a lot of government help, whereas you guys are sort of on your own. Does that concern you? Fields: Well, we don't feel we're being disadvantaged, because we have been restructuring our company over the past three years. We have been investing in high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles over the last couple of years, which are just starting to come to the marketplace. So our approach is continue to work this plan, continue to make sure that Ford remains competitive both today and in the future and continue to work with our stakeholders to make sure that happens.","Ford exec says company has been restructuring over last three years .

"(CNN)  -- California legislators plan to keep trying to find consensus on a controversial proposal that would release at least 27,000 inmates from state prisons. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, right, and officials tour a prison last week in Chino after a riot there. The California Assembly on Monday delayed a possible vote on the plan. Lawmakers likely will take up the proposal Wednesday or Thursday, said Shannon Murphy, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Karen Bass. ""When we arrive at a responsible plan that can earn the support of the majority of the Assembly and make sense to the people of California, we will take that bill up on the Assembly floor,"" Bass, a Los Angeles Democrat, said in a statement. Bass said legislators continue to meet with each other and law enforcement authorities to try to craft a plan that increases public safety, improves the state corrections department and reduces costs. As part of the negotiations, a provision that would set up a 16-member sentencing commission -- which would put new sentencing guidelines in place by 2012 -- was stripped from the bill, Murphy said. But ""it's not as if we're giving up on that notion,"" she said. The sentencing commission is a priority for Bass, she said, but the speaker believes she will have more success if she introduces a separate bill to create it. A panel of three federal judges has ordered California to reduce its prison population by about 40,000 by mid-September. The judges acted on the grounds that overcrowded prisons violate inmates' constitutional rights. The state Senate voted 21-19 Friday to release several thousand inmates early. That vote came after Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, a Sacramento Democrat, assured senators the public would be protected from the most violent offenders. ""Of course, we want to keep violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities, and this reform package is a necessary step to do that because it concentrates our incarceration efforts on the violent criminals and ensures that nonviolent offenders have more contact with parole officers,"" Steinberg said Friday. All 15 Senate Republicans voted against the bill, arguing that it undermines public safety. Democrats control both houses of the California Legislature. ""California's prison system is in a state of crisis,"" Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said last week while touring the California Institution for Men in Chino. Some 250 inmates were injured this month at the facility in a riot that officials said was ignited by racial tension. Fifty-five inmates were taken to hospitals with serious injuries, including stab wounds and head trauma. Schwarzenegger said the riot was ""a terrible symptom of a much larger problem. ... Our prisons are overcrowded and endangering the staff and the inmates."" The governor noted he had signed a budget that mandates $1.2 billion in cuts to the state corrections system. ""We must be measured and smart about how we go about and create those reductions,"" said Schwarzenegger, a Republican. ""We must find a way to cut costs and relieve overcrowding but without sacrificing public safety."" Steinberg said the bill under debate would save the financially strapped state some $524.5 million. Coupled with budget revisions made in July, the savings would total the entire $1.2 billion, he said. Republicans said the bill would lead to the release of about 27,000 prisoners, while Democrats estimated it would reduce the prison population by 27,300 in the 2009-10 fiscal year and 37,000 during fiscal year 2010-11. But Steinberg said the measure also would reduce the ratio of parolees to parole officers to 45-to-1. Currently, one parole officer is responsible for about 70 parolees, many of whom commit new crimes and return to custody; the state has a 70 percent recidivism rate.","California Assembly delays vote on plan to release at least 27,000 inmates .

"(CNN)  -- An extradition hearing is expected in Spain this week for one of two pilots arrested recently on charges they participated in ""death flights"" in which more than 1,000 prisoners were thrown out of planes during Argentina's ""dirty war"" in the 1970s and 1980s, officials said. Hebe de Bonafini, left, and members of Madres de Plaza de Mayo hold a demonstration in 2006. Former Navy Lt. Julio Alberto Poch, who has been held in Spain without bail since his arrest in Valencia in late September, will have a hearing before a high court in Madrid, a judge in Valencia ruled. An Argentine judge has asked that Poch be sent back to face long-standing charges from the 1976-83 right-wing dictatorship. In Argentina, police arrested former Navy Capt. Emir Sisul Hess last week in the town of Bariloche, near the border with Chile. An initial hearing for Sisul Hess was held Friday, federal court official Cecilia Brizzio told CNN. Poch and Sisul Hess are accused of piloting aircraft from which drugged and blindfolded prisoners were hurled to their deaths in the Atlantic Ocean or the Rio Plata. The prisoners included students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who had run afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views. Most were dragged off the street or otherwise summarily arrested and held without trial in secret prisons where many were tortured. Sisul Hess, accused in more than 900 deaths, has denied the allegations, said Argentina's government-run Telam news agency. According to Telam, both men were arrested after they told colleagues or friends about their alleged involvement. Up to 30,000 people disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the dictatorship. Argentine human rights activist Hebe de Bonafini, who lost two sons and a daughter-in-law in the ""dirty war,"" said Monday she found no joy in the arrests. ""You can never take back the horror,"" she said. ""In no way am I happy."" Bonafini is president of the Association of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group of mothers whose children disappeared during the war. She urged the government to continue looking for war crime suspects. Speaking of the pilots, she said, ""There are several. They are not the only ones."" Poch, a commercial pilot for the Dutch airline Transavia.com, was arrested September 23 when his flight made a stopover in Valencia, Telam said. He was wanted on an international arrest warrant. Poch had been a navy pilot from 1976 until late 1980, Telam said. Upon leaving the navy, he moved to Holland and had been living there ever since. Argentine federal Judge Sergio Gabriel Torres is pursuing the extradition of Poch and handling the arrest of Sisul Hess. Torres traveled to Holland to question Poch's colleagues and others, Telam said. An aviator told Torres that Poch had said at a restaurant in Indonesia in December 2003 that there were occasions in which people were thrown out of helicopters and airplanes because the armed forces were dealing with ""terrorists,"" Telam said. The aviator, identified as Tim Eisso Weert, told the judge that Poch said it was a humane way to execute people because they were drugged, the government news agency reported. A co-pilot told the judge that Poch had said they ""should have killed all"" the subversives, Telam reported, and that he admitted ""some responsibility"" because ""when you fly persons on board the responsibility lies with the pilot."" Sisul Hess is similarly said to have implicated himself, telling friends that the prisoners ""did not suffer because they were drugged, falling like little ants,"" Telam said. Sisul Hess served as a helicopter pilot in 1976-77 and retired as a captain in 1991, the news agency said. He was arrested September 29 and transferred to Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital. Judge Torres was not available Monday to take three phone calls from CNN, aides said. Nor were any documents on the cases available, the aides said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama will place tariffs on imports of some Chinese tires for three years in an effort to curb a surge in exports that has rocked the U.S. tire industry. The White House announced plans to impose tariffs on some tires entering the United States from China. The new tariffs will be on passenger car and light truck tires, the White House said in a statement Friday night. ""The president decided to remedy the clear disruption to the U.S. tire industry based on the facts and the law in this case,"" the statement said. The tariffs will start at 35 percent in the first year, then would decline to 30 percent in the second year and 25 percent in the third. Chinese leaders have in the past expressed displeasure about a possible tire tariff. ""We hope the U.S. government will refrain from taking action, for the long-term healthy and stable development of U.S.-Chinese relations,"" Fu Ziying, China's vice commerce minister, told local media in August. ""The case is neither supported by facts nor does it have valid legal grounds,"" he added.","U.S. to impose tariffs on some passenger car and light truck tires from China .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- An archaeological dig in Jerusalem has turned up a 3,700-year-old wall that is the largest and oldest of its kind found in the region, experts say. The wall is built of enormous boulders, confounding archaeologists as to how ancient peoples built it. Standing 8 meters (26 feet) high, the wall of huge cut stones is a marvel to archaeologists. ""To build straight walls up 8 meters ... I don't know how to do it today without mechanical equipment,"" said the excavation's director, Ronny Reich. ""I don't think that any engineer today without electrical power [could] do it."" Archaeologist Eli Shukron of the Israel Antiquities Authority added, ""You see all the big boulders -- all the boulders are 4 to 5 tons."" The discovered section is 24 meters (79 feet) long. ""However, it is thought the fortification is much longer because it continues west beyond the part that was exposed,"" the Israel Antiquities Authority said in a news release. It was found inside the City of David, an archaeological excavation site outside the Old City of East Jerusalem on a slope of the Silwan Valley. The wall is believed to have been built by the Canaanites, an ancient pagan people who the Bible says inhabited Jerusalem and other parts of the Middle East before the advent of monotheism. Watch report on the discovery of the ancient wall Â» . ""This is the most massive wall that has ever been uncovered in the City of David,"" Reich and Shukron said in a joint statement about the find. It marks the first time ""that such massive construction that predates the Herodian period has been discovered in Jerusalem."" It appears to be part of a ""protected, well-fortified passage that descends to the spring tower from some sort of fortress that stood at the top of the hill,"" according to the joint statement. The spring ""is located in the weakest and most vulnerable place in the area. The construction of a protected passage, even though it involves tremendous effort, is a solution for which there are several parallels in antiquity, albeit from periods that are later than the remains described here."" Such walls were used primarily to defend against marauding desert nomads looking to rob the city, said Reich, a professor at the University of Haifa. ""We are dealing with a gigantic fortification, from the standpoint of the structure's dimensions, the thickness of its walls and the size of the stones that were incorporated in its construction,"" the joint statement said. Water from the spring is used by modern inhabitants of Jerusalem. ""The new discovery shows that the picture regarding Jerusalem's eastern defenses and the ancient water system in the Middle Bronze Age 2 is still far from clear,"" Reich said. ""Despite the fact that so many have excavated on this hill, there is a very good chance that extremely large and well-preserved architectural elements are still hidden in it and waiting to be uncovered.""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- President Obama mixed policy discussion with personal reflections on his daughters and, yes, a few jokes in an appearance on CBS' ""Late Show With David Letterman."" President Obama jokes with David Letterman in New York in an interview taped Monday afternoon. It was the first time a sitting president has been a guest on the popular late-night entertainment show, according to the CBS Web site. It was taped Monday afternoon. After taking the stage to a huge ovation, Obama teased Letterman about being surprised to see the event on his daily schedule, saying: ""That's one of those where you ask your advisers, 'Who's responsible for this?' "" Later, when talking about summer activities of daughters Malia, 11, and Sasha, 8, Obama said that they ""goofed off,"" which he added was something he couldn't do. Letterman quickly quipped: ""Well, others have,"" prompting a big laugh from both the audience and the president. On topical issues, Obama promised to ask ""tough questions"" before deciding whether to send additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan, saying it was necessary to have a clear strategy in place before deploying resources.  Watch Obama talk with Letterman Â» . He said his ""No. 1 job"" is to make sure the terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks can never harm the United States again. Asked about the economy, Obama called the $787 billion economic stimulus package passed in his first month in office a ""tourniquet"" that prevented the recession from getting worse. Complete economic recovery will take time, he warned, but added that the situation appeared to be getting better. On the hostile debate over his push to overhaul the nation's health care system, Obama disagreed with the analysis by some that the public anger against him is fueled by racism. He drew a big laugh by pointing out he was black before he became president, then noted that his election by the American public ""tells you ... a lot about where the country is at."" ""I think that what's happened is that whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes, particularly during times of economic unease, then there is a certain segment of the population that gets very riled up,"" Obama said. Previous presidents including Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan also generated emotional opposition, Obama said. ""This is not untypical,"" he said.

"ATHENS, Greece (CNN) -- Greece's opposition Socialist party on Sunday defeated the incumbent center-right government of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis, as Socialist leader George Papandreou promised to chart a new course for an economic comeback. Socialist George Papandreou is set to become Greece's next prime minister. ""On this course, nothing is going to be easy -- it will take work, hard work,"" Papandreou said in his victory address. ""And I will always be honest with the Greek people so that we may better solve the problems of the state."" Sunday's national elections were held two years before originally scheduled. Karamanlis called the elections in response to pressure from Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement of Greece, which threatened to block the election of a president in February if no general election was held. The Greek constitution requires the two major parties to agree on the election of a president, giving either party an effective veto. Karamanlis' term was not due to expire until September 2011. But Papandreou insisted on new elections before the end of President Karolos Papoulias' term as president. The country's ailing economy was the focus in the run up to the elections, as both candidates offered conflicting prescriptions to revive it. While Karamanlis called for cuts in spending, Papandreou proposed a massive stimulus. Karamanlis, of the New Democracy party, congratulated Papandreou in a nationally televised concession speech. ""And like every Greek, I hope that he succeeds at the big challenge of facing up to the economic situation,"" Karamanlis said. ""Because this challenge, I have said many times, is a national issue."" It was unclear whether Karamanlis would step down as New Democracy party leader, as the elections marked the worst defeat the party has seen in more than 20 years. According to figures posted on the Interior Ministry's Web site, the Socialist party received 44 percent of the vote, compared wotj New Democracy's 34 percent, with 87 percent of votes counted. The margin is the largest seen in a Greek vote in decades. The Socialist party will receive an estimated 160 seats in Greece's 300-seat Parliament, officials said, compared with New Democracy's 93 seats. Greek state television ERT showed cheering, flag-waving crowds surrounding  Papandreou as he made his way to party headquarters. ""All of the opinion polls are suggesting that Greek voters are becoming more frustrated with (Karamanlis') governance, more frustrated that after two parliamentary terms some of the objectives which he'd set have not been achieved,"" Kevin Featherstone, director of the London School of Economics' Hellenic Observatory, told CNN. However, Papandreou's stimulus plan is also under scrutiny, with critics wanting to know more details, such as how it would be funded. In addition, problems such as corruption have long plagued the Greek government, Featherstone noted. ""These are systemic problems. These are problems which have been in  Greece for generations. Over the last 20 years, we've had a succession of governments coming into power promising to clean up, promising to tackle waste, promising to reform the public administration, promising to be more transparent and clean,"" he said. ""By and large, voters have been disappointed or there has been some fair degree of frustration and disappointment."" ""Tackling the problem, these endemic problems, really requires major efforts to reform public administration to tackle corruption and to change the culture of expectations,"" he said. Karamanlis' conservative New Democracy party suffered a sharp setback in European elections in June, when the Socialists matched New Democracy's tally of eight seats, with 36 percent of the vote. That election was seen as a litmus test for Karamanlis at a time of political and economic uncertainty with the economy shrinking and the country staring at a recession after nearly 15 years of high-profile growth. Nearly 10 million Greeks are registered to vote. CNN's Christine Theodorou and Journalist Anthee Carrasava contributed to this report.","87% of votes counted; Socialists to get about 160 seats in 300-seat Parliament .

Police officers went to the couple's Clarksville home shortly after 3 a.m. after receiving notice of a possible shooting, Knoll said. ""When the officers responded, the door was ajar; they went in and found her inside of the garage, and she had been shot,"" Knoll told CNN in a telephone interview. A few hours later, officers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol and the Robertson County Sheriff's Office located Downing's vehicle about 20 miles away in Robertson County and found Downing in woods nearby, Knoll said. ""That's where he finally gave up,"" Knoll said. ""It took them almost two hours to convince him.""

"(CNN) -- Spongy red balls wait in a queue, separating two teams wired to smack their opponent. Within seconds, the players dip and dive like dolphins until one player stands alone, relishing in victory. An adult plays in a dodge ball league organized by the . City of Sparks Parks and Recreation in Nevada. It's the classic game of dodge ball, but these aren't fifth-graders during PE class in Sparks, Nevada. The childhood sport of dodge ball made a comeback four years ago in this bedroom community among adults in their 20s and 30s -- and even a few players who reached retirement. Now, hundreds of working professionals, doctors, lawyers and teachers congregate at the local recreation center for a dose of dodge ball on Sunday nights. ""I think a lot of it goes back to trying to stay young,"" said Tony Pehle, recreation supervisor in Sparks, who started the dodge ball program after being inspired by the 2004 Ben Stiller movie ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story."" ""They might be adults, but they still like to play and have fun."" Has Peter Pan syndrome come to stay? From playing dodge ball to jumping double Dutch and competing in rock-paper-scissors, adult men and women, from urban nests to rural towns, are reveling in games and activities once thought to be child's play. The 2009 World Yo-Yo Contest in Orlando, Florida, this weekend (August 13)  is all grown up, attracting more than 150 adult competitors, who can showcase dizzying tricks with the flick of a finger. Later in the month, hundreds of adults outfitted in pirate and animal costumes will race their homebuilt vehicles for Oregon's annual Portland Adult Soapbox Derby, a crafty activity that began for youths in the 1930s. ""Once a year, I get to build something for the kid in me,"" says Jason Hogue, a 41-year-old carpenter, who has participated in the race for eight years. Last year, he constructed a car shaped like a hammerhead shark. ""We get to use our creativity and get excited with our friends."" Whether they're done to seek refuge from the daily grind or to provide nostalgia for youthful days -- or they're a product of what some experts say is a generation that can't grow up -- these juvenile pastimes are getting more popular. For example, adult viewership of the Nickelodeon show ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" swelled by 51 percent from 1999 to 2009, officials say. The World Adult Kickball Association, one of the largest kickball organizations, has spread its tentacles to 33 states as well a soldier division in Iraq. WAKA Kickball began as a casual game between a few young single friends in their 20s in Washington, D.C. Now, the games appeal to tens of thousands of adults, many of them yuppies wanting a quick escape from the stresses of their first 401(k), mortgage and job. ""I played soccer growing up, and I like competition,"" says avid kickball player Marlon LeWinter, 28, of New York City. LeWinter, a public relations executive, usually plays the position of center with a bunch of producers, writers and analysts in their late 20s. They named their team Chipwich Nation after they scarfed down the cookies-and-ice cream treat at a bar after a game one night. ""Sometimes when it's [the score] two to one in a kickball came, I get the jitters,"" he says. The economic bind also creates a favorable environment for adults to latch onto simple children's games and sports. With players who are trapped in a world of layoffs and job freezes, these adult leagues, contests and tournaments are the equivalent of sandbox time for children. They can make new friends and go for a beer after the game. These activities are also budget-friendly, costing less than $100 to join for several months of play -- much less than a golf club membership. Since the recession, Duncan Toys, one of the biggest yo-yo manufacturers in the United States, has seen sales spike. A company official noticed many of the adults who purchased yo-yos tried to get the same models they owned as kids. ""Nowadays, everything is taken so seriously that people revert to something like playing with a yo-yo,"" says Mike McBride, a 34-year-old multimedia designer who picked up the activity shortly after college. McBride, who will compete in the Orlando World Yo-Yo contest, says the activity helps him relieve stress. ""There's no pressure."" In 2006, Christopher Noxon, in his book ""Rejuvenile,"" explored why adults fancy childhood pursuits like kickball, cartoons and cupcakes. Beginning with Generation X adults in the 1990s, the group began to shift from the norms of the hierarchal corporate ladder, and the age of marriage began to steadily climb. Soon, juvenile activities that had been regarded as silly became hip. Quirky became cool, and more organized teams, groups and competitions for playground sports and childlike hobbies emerged. ""Our whole idea of adulthood has changed,"" says Noxon. ""We value flexibility and creativity, and these are things kids are good at. It's brought us back to what we had as children."" But it isn't just the younger generations that clutch leftovers from their youth or become interested in child-like activities. Grandparents in their 70s and 80s still collect roomfuls of model train sets, romanticizing the days when the only way to travel was by choo-choo. Women in their 40s acquire American Girl dolls that stir fond memories of reading the novels during childhood. Psychology experts say it shouldn't be a surprise that the affinity for childhood hobbies and activities extends across generations. After all, Americans have long had an obsession with youth. To be young is associated with being fun, vibrant and active. In the Internet age, finding one's inner child has never been easier, with the proliferation of social networks such as Facebook or Web sites like Meetup.com, where users can create groups and meeting times for activities. On the site, groups of adults organize scavenger hunts in Atlanta, Georgia, and action figure discussions in New York City. ""This is a generation of people who are far less homogenous and more niche-oriented,"" says Judith Sills, a clinical psychologist who works with young adults. ""They can bond around their quirky differences. Ten years ago, you couldn't have easily found another kickball player, even if you wanted to play.""","WAKA Kickball started more than a decade ago by a few friends is now in 33 states .

"(CNN) -- It's a familiar scenario: A major crime is committed. Police investigate possible leads while the media asks for information. Soon, authorities say they have a ""person of interest."" Raymond Clark was named a person of interest, and then charged with murdering Yale grad student Annie Le. But what does this term mean? ""The 'person of interest' tells you nothing,"" says Cynthia Hujar Orr, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ""They are suspicious of that person, but the police don't have the evidence they need."" Investigators named Raymond Clark a ""person of interest"" after 24-year-old Yale University graduate student Annie Le was found dead in the basement of an off-campus lab. Officer Joe Avery, of the New Haven Police Department, said Clark was a ""person of interest"" because he worked in the same highly-secured lab where Le was last seen. Authorities detained Clark, 24, on Tuesday, took his DNA and searched his home. They released him, and his lawyer said Clark was fully cooperating with authorities. Then, on Thursday, Clark was arrested and charged with Le's murder.  Watch police announce the arrest Â» . But not everyone who is called a person of interest becomes a suspect. In the last decade, law enforcement authorities have increasingly used the phrase -- but the label didn't necessarily mean the person would be charged. According to one analysis of 40 cases, half of the ""persons of interest"" were released without charges. The exact origin of the phrase ""person of interest"" is unknown. But several criminology professors and attorneys who spoke with CNN said they believe the phrase became widely used after the 1996 Olympic Park bombings in Atlanta, Georgia, when media outlets called security guard Richard Jewell a suspect. Jewell was never charged, and was eventually cleared. Several years later, Eric Rudolph was arrested and convicted for the crime. Jewell died in August 2007. Jewell sued the FBI and several media organizations -- including CNN, NBC and the Atlanta Journal Constitution -- for libel and slander. The CNN and NBC suits were settled. The U.S. Attorney's Office gave him an unprecedented government acknowledgment of wrongful accusation. Law enforcement officers and the media began using the term ""person of interest"" as a shield against civil litigation. But some attorneys, criminologists and media experts say using the loose term ""person of interest"" can tarnish the person's reputation, mislead the public, and possibly hurt the investigation. Using the phrase is a way for authorities to draw attention to the person without formally accusing them, they say.  Watch a discussion of the phrase 'person of interest' Â» . ""It's a really bad term to use, because the public reads 'suspect,' "" said Kelly McBride, ethics group leader at the Poynter Institute, a national journalism training institute in St. Petersburg, Florida. Donna Shaw, a journalism professor at The College of New Jersey, said she believes federal law enforcement officials invented the phrase in the mid-1990s to satiate journalists hounding them for information. Soon, local law enforcement officers began to pick up on the phrase. Shaw studied a year's worth of stories with the term ""person of interest"" in 2006, interviewing representatives from local police departments on why the term was utilized. ""Some of the police told me, ' We don't know what it means but it makes reporters happy,' "" Shaw said. Her research found that fewer than half of the people identified as ""persons of interest"" were ever charged with the crimes, yet their stories remained ingrained on the Internet after their exoneration. In the U.S. Attorney's Manual, a guidebook used by federal criminal prosecutors, the phrase ""person of interest"" doesn't exist. It is not a legal term used by attorneys. Police are trained to use lingo like ""suspect,"" ""subject"" and ""target."" James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said the expression ""person of interest"" is closest in meaning to the word ""subject"" but doesn't necessarily mean that person is a ""suspect."" A subject is a police term used to describe someone who appears suspicious for circumstantial reasons. Common ""subjects"" could be a victim's husband or boyfriend, Fox said. In the case of graduate student Annie Le, Raymond Clark worked in the same lab. In contrast, a suspect is someone against whom police have specific evidence leading investigators to believe the person committed the crime and will likely be charged, he said. In some instances, as in Clark's case, a ""person of interest"" can eventually become a suspect, who is then arrested and charged. ""Any particular crime will have several 'people of interest,' "" Fox said. ""But much of the time a person of interest is just that, once the police investigate and find out they have an alibi."" Steven Hatfill, a former U.S. Army bio-weapons scientist, found his reputation destroyed after Attorney General John Ashcroft named him a ""person of interest"" in the 2001 anthrax attacks. In the investigation that followed, Hatfill was never charged. He was never named a suspect. ""The government failed us, not only by failing to catch the anthrax mailers but by seeking to conceal that failure,"" a lawyer for Hatfill said in 2008 after winning a $2.8 million settlement of an invasion of privacy lawsuit against the Justice Department. ""Our government did this by leaking gossip, speculation and misinformation to a handful of credulous reporters,"" the lawyer added. The man whom authorities eventually blamed for the anthrax attacks, Bruce Ivins, committed suicide in 2008 as federal agents were closing in on him, police said. Officials at the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers in Washington, D.C., said authorities who use the phrase ""person of interest"" can confuse the person who is in custody. A person who is labeled a ""person of interest"" might not seek out an attorney under the mistaken belief he or she is simply a witness, and the vague term can make it easier for police to get a confession, they said. Clark, the technician labeled a ""person of interest"" in the Yale student's slaying, answered some questions and then obtained an attorney, police said. Scott Burns, executive director of the National District Attorneys Association, said the imprecise phrase can help law enforcement to establish credibility among the public by suggesting that they are making progress in a case. By saying you have a suspect, he explained, ""You are putting your nickel down and saying we think we have the guy.""","Police began widely using ""person of interest"" after 1996 Olympic Park bombing .

"Editor's note: Nancy Grace is the host of ""Nancy Grace"" on HLN nightly at 8 and 10 p.m. ET. Read an excerpt from her new novel ""The Eleventh Victim"" published by Hyperion. Nancy Grace found it challenging to complete her first novel, ""The Eleventh Victim."" (CNN) -- Readers of Nancy Grace's debut novel, ""The Eleventh Victim,"" would be forgiven if they assumed the main character is based on Grace. After all, the heroine of the novel becomes an Atlanta, Georgia, district attorney after her fiancÃ© is murdered and later relocates to New York for a fresh start. But Grace said there are some differences between her and her protagonist. ""Hailey is a much better person than I am,"" Grace said. The tough-as-nails anchor of the HLN show that bears her name was driven to complete her first book of fiction, which she said has been in the works for almost a decade. The novel centers on the character of Hailey Dean, a psychology student who becomes a prosecutor after the tragic murder of her fiancÃ© just weeks before their wedding. The mystery takes flight when Dean, having relocated to Manhattan and trained as a therapist, discovers that her patients are being murdered in a copycat style of an Atlanta serial killer from her past. Grace -- who is also the author of the nonfiction book ""Objection!"" -- recently spoke to CNN about the challenges of giving birth to both twins and a thriller, who might die in her next novel and what she thinks about television shows like ""Saturday Night Live"" parodying her. CNN: You are a working mother of two year-old twins. How in the world did you find time to write a book? Nancy Grace: It was hard work. I had done ""Objection"" and I had an idea for a second nonfiction. I went back to my editor and I said ""Here's an idea for another nonfiction."" She said ""Yeah, it's OK, you got anything else?"" I said ""No, but I do have an old manuscript I've been working on for a long time, a murder mystery."" I told her it's not finished yet, I have about 300 pages. I took it over that day and the next day they told me they wanted a two-book series on Hailey Dean. Then I thought ""Oh Lord, now I've got to finish it."" That happened around the time I got pregnant.  Watch Nancy discuss her new book Â» . I had a difficult pregnancy. I was in a wheelchair, I threw up every day, I broke my foot during the pregnancy, so a lot of crazy things happened. Finally, after the twins came, the deadline came. I literally had to sit in the bed with the computer and force myself to finish it. I knew what was going to happen in each of the four storylines, but I had to get there. I would be up sometimes until 3 or 4 in the morning. The twins, one would wake up, by the time I would get that one fed and down, the other one would wake up and then it was time to get up at 5:30. CNN: You said you knew who did it in terms of the mystery early on in the writing. So how did the book change during its development? Grace: The characters really developed. It's like getting to know a person. Read an excerpt from the novel . There are certain things Hailey simply would not do.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Soon after I first came to visit China in the autumn of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching drills in Tiananmen Square. I was told they were rehearsing for the annual National Day parade on October 1, which people eagerly awaited. Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949. Weeks later, however, I was informed that the civilian and military parade had been cancelled in the spirit of ""simple-living and hard struggle,"" as Chairman Mao decreed. The real reason: Lin Biao, then defense minister and Mao's anointed successor, had reportedly died in a plane crash while attempting to flee the country after a failed coup attempt. China's achievements in the last 60 years have come in zigs and zags. The best place to look back at what China went through in the past six decades is Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Behind it lies the Imperial Palace, or Forbidden City, where China's Emperors used to live. The emperor is now history, but Tiananmen remains Beijing's political center. It was on the Tiananmen rostrum where Chairman Mao formally proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic. ""The Chinese people have stood up!"" he declared in a shrill Hunanese accent. For decades, the whole nation followed Mao loyally. He emphasized political mobilization of the common man, especially the peasantry. In Mao's ideology, the Chinese people found hope in a New China, wherein citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothes to wear. Mao proved to be good at fighting but poor at governing. He pushed sweeping socio-economic initiatives and strident ideological campaigns, often with disastrous results. During two political campaigns in the late 1950s, over 550,000 ""rightist"" intellectuals were persecuted and imprisoned. The Great Leap Forward led to widespread famine and the deaths of an estimated 30 million Chinese. In the late 1960s, Mao would again stand in the Tiananmen rostrum to launch the Cultural Revolution. There, he rallied hundreds of thousands of young Chinese -- the radical Red Guards -- who lionized him like a demi-god. ""To rebel is justified!"" they proclaimed. They rebelled against everything and wreaked havoc everywhere. For ten years, China was condemned to political turmoil and economic malaise. Perhaps the only factor that kept the country from total collapse was the people's incomparable resilience and their ability to ""chi ku"" (eat bitterness, or bear hardship). Mao's reign is also credited for positive changes. He banned child brides and polygamy, built Beijing's first subway line and started a space program with China's first satellite launch. In 1972, the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the United Nations. Still, for three decades under Mao, China tried to break out of its backwardness and isolation but only met modest success. Mao died in 1976 and his remains are kept in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.  Take an audiovisual tour of Mao's hometown Â» . Soon enough, Deng Xiaoping emerged as the new paramount leader. Deng overturned most of Mao's policies and embarked upon reforming the economy and opening up the country to the outside world. His quest for stability and prosperity took off in the early 1990s, propelled by his pragmatic policies to entice foreign investments and build China's private sector. Just south of Tiananmen, one landmark stands as a symbol of Deng's bold open-door policy. In the early 1980s, the first Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet opened in Beijing, just a stone's throw away from Mao's mausoleum. Today, the fast food chain still does brisk business, with a large portrait of founder Colonel Sanders hanging on the three-story building. Not every Chinese embraced Deng's reform and open-door policy. Old Guards and conservatives in and outside the communist party accepted Deng's reform policies, but with a great deal of misgiving. The backlash came to a boil in 1989, when Tiananmen witnessed an outpouring of support for the students who called for freedom and democracy, and more reform. After six weeks of heady demonstrations, the Tiananmen movement was brutally suppressed.  See landmark moments in China's 60 years Â» . China has returned to world prominence through a 20-year economic boom, the speed and breadth of which is unparalleled in the history of mankind. China went from global economic irrelevance to the third largest economy in the world. The People's Liberation Army, no longer a ""junkyard army,"" has emerged as a formidable military power capable of launching a human being into space and shooting down satellites.  Take a look inside China's space program Â» . The People's Republic of China marks its 60th anniversary on Thursday with 300,000 participants and 60 floats to highlight the country's achievements in various sectors of the society and economy.

Modern military hardware -- tanks, armed personnel carriers, missiles, helicopters and fighter jets, all made in China -- will be on display. Fireworks will cap the festivities.  See how China has changed over 60 years Â» . But pomp and pageantry aside, China's phenomenal economic growth over the decades has triggered unintended consequences: rising unemployment, growing income gaps, endemic corruption, rising criminality, environmental degradation and social malaise. Millions of Chinese live on less than $1 a day, and social tension sometimes boil over into violent clashes. Chinese president Hu Jintao is pushing to promote democracy in the party, curb corruption and seek a harmonious society. ""To build a well-off society for 1.3 billion people and a democratic, civilized, harmonious and modernized country,"" he recently told a communist party meeting, ""China must firmly push reform and opening up and stick to its own path.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Ryanair on Monday rejected strong criticism from Britain's top business regulator, who accused Europe's largest airline of ""puerile"" tactics in the way it adds credit card fees on to advertised fares. John Fingleton, head of the UK's Office of Fair Trading watchdog, said the no-frills carrier was playing a ""funny game"" by imposing fees for anyone not using an obscure credit card. Fingleton, speaking to the UK's Independent newspaper, expressed dismay that the airline was able to advertise credit card fees as ""optional"" through its acceptance of a pre-paid MasterCard. ""Ryanair has this funny game where they have found some low frequency payment mechanism and say: 'Well, because you can pay with that [the charge is optional]',"" he said. ""It's almost like taunting consumers and pointing out: 'Oh well, we know this is completely outside the spirit of the law, but we think it's within the narrow letter of the law'."" Ryanair, which outlines its credit chard charges on its Web site, rejected Fingleton's comments, accusing the business regulator of trying to detract from its failure to tackle other issues facing the country's aviation industry. ""Ryanair fails to understand why it was singled out for these inaccurate criticisms by Mr. Fingleton, when its charges policies are copied by high fare UK airlines,"" it said in a statement.","UK business regulator says Ryanair playing a ""funny game"" over booking fees .

"London, England (CNN) -- Kraft's fresh bid for suffered a double blow Tuesday as the improved offer was dismissed by the British candy company and criticized by billionaire investor Warren Buffett who controls an influential stake in the U.S. food giant. Buffett said he had voted against Kraft's plan to issue new shares as part of a cash and stock offer worth approximately $16 billion, warning it would hurt shareholders, Fortune reported. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway company owns 138 million Kraft shares, making it the largest shareholder in the foodmaker with a 9.4 percent stake. But in a statement, he warned Kraft's move for Cadbury risked undervaluing Kraft stock. ""Kraft stock, at its current price of $27, is a very expensive 'currency' to be used in an acquisition,"" Buffett said. ""In 2007, in fact, Kraft spent $3.6 billion to repurchase shares at about $33 per share, presumably because the directors and management thought the shares to be worth more."" Earlier, Illinois-based Kraft said it would use the proceeds from the sale of its U.S. pizza business to Nestle to increase the cash element of its Cadbury offer. Under Kraft's offer of a partial cash alternative, Cadbury shareholders could receive cash as well as Kraft shares if they accept Kraft's deal. ""Kraft Foods is doing this because of the desire expressed by some Cadbury security holders to have a greater proportion of the offer in cash,"" Kraft said in a statement. The maker of Jell-O, Cool Whip, Oreo cookies and Kraft Macaroni & Cheese also extended the Cadbury offer to February 2. The original bid had expired Tuesday. Cadbury, which rejected Kraft's previous two deals, rejected the new offer Tuesday. ""Kraft has once again missed the point,"" a Cadbury spokesman told CNN. ""Despite this tinkering, the Kraft offer remains unchanged and derisory, with less than half the consideration in cash."" There had been rumors that Swiss firm Nestle, which already has a chocolate and confectionery unit, would step in and make its own offer for Cadbury. But Nestle put an end to those rumors Tuesday by issuing a statement saying it had no intention to make an offer for the British company. Instead, Nestle said it had bought Kraft's frozen pizza business in the United States and Canada for $3.7 billion. The unit includes brands like DiGiorno, Tombstone, and California Pizza Kitchen. ""The acquisition brings leadership in the frozen pizza category, where Nestle only had a minor presence until now, and builds on Nestle's existing pizza know-how and operations in Europe,"" Nestle said in a statement Tuesday. ""It is a natural fit with Nestle's focus on delivering convenient, premium, wholesome and nutritious frozen food for consumers around the world."" Nestle already had a presence in American frozen food aisles with ready-meal brands like Stouffer's, Lean Cuisine, and Hot Pockets. The proceeds from the sale allow Kraft to offer more cash to Cadbury shareholders -- an additional 60 pence (96 cents) per share, Kraft said. Kraft originally offered Cadbury shareholders 300 pence ($4.81) and 0.26 Kraft shares for each share of Cadbury they own. Kraft said it will announce more detailed terms by January 19.","Kraft raises offer, extends deadline in takeover bid for Cadbury .

"(CNN) -- Salvador Cabanas remains in a critical condition in hospital as doctors admit they are having difficulty treating the Paraguay international due to increased swelling on his brain. The Club America striker was shot in the head in Mexico City during the early hours of Monday morning after an incident in a city bar. Cabanas was transported to an intensive care unit at a local hospital and was rushed into theatre where doctors made an attempt to remove the bullet lodged in his skull before deciding it would be too dangerous. Doctors revealed he showed favorable signs when they attempted to bring him out of an induced coma but have now been forced to increase the sedation as the swelling on his brain worsens. ""Salvador remains clinically stable, nevertheless we have had certain problems because the excess accumulation of water on his brain has grown,"" Ernesto Martinez Duhart, who operated on Cabanas, told reporters. ""We will have to keep him sedated a bit more to protect and improve cerebral function. It could get worse, he continues to be in the same serious condition. The risk of death has not yet passed."" Cabanas is one of Paraguay's top players and was part of their World Cup squad in Germany four years ago. The 29-year-old is a prolific goalscorer and was expected to lead Paraguay's attack in South Africa this summer. He has scored over 100 times in the Mexican top flight and has netted 18 goals in 24 matches this season. Around 10,000 Paraguayan fans gathered at the the Estadio Defensores del Chaco, the country's national stadium in Asuncion, to hold a vigil for Cabanas on Tuesday evening.","Paraguay international striker Salvador Cabanas remains in a critical condition in hospital .

"(CNN) -- David Waller has some simple advice for anyone looking to improve morale at their organization -- even if it's not the easiest advice to follow. IAEA deputy director David Waller calls Nobel ""a bolt of lightning"" for his staff . ""I say to them, jokingly, 'Why don't you try winning the Nobel Peace Prize?' "" he said. Waller, deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, knows what he's talking about. The organization, based in Vienna, Austria, and dedicated to the safe and peaceful use of nuclear power, was awarded the prize in 2005. President Barack Obama was the surprise winner Friday of this year's peace prize. But for most of this week's other winners, the honor marks a leap from relative obscurity to a spot in the international limelight. Waller said the scientists, authors, activists and others receiving Nobel honors this week should be prepared for an experience that will change their lives in the months and years that follow. ""The day that it was announced that we were winning the Nobel Peace Prize, I can assure you that it was like a bolt of lightning that went through this place in terms of energizing staff and giving people a sense of self-worth,"" he said. ""It was absolutely remarkable."" In all, 172 people and 33 organizations were nominated for the peace prize-- although the Oslo, Norway-based Nobel committee had not announced who its finalists were. The peace prize is one of five awards handed out annually by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. The other four prizes are for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. Starting in 1969, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded. The peace prize is the last of the awards to be announced this week and the Riksbank prize will be awarded Monday. Even for an organization like the IAEA, a United Nations affiliate that traces its roots back to 1957, things were never the same after receiving the revered award, Waller said. ""Many, many things changed,"" he said. ""The number of applications we had for positions here, which was already high, skyrocketed. People returned phone calls very quickly. The whole spectrum of things of that nature changed."" Elizabeth Dobie-Sarsam, a media specialist with the agency, remembers the day it received the Nobel -- she was on vacation and asleep on her sister's floor in Canada when it was announced. ""For three years running, we had been sitting on the edges of our chairs hoping that we won,"" she said. ""That year, for some reason, we thought, 'Oh, forget it. We're not going to get it.' "" The trip back to Vienna would have taken her too long to handle the initial rush of attention, so she finished her vacation, with family members introducing her as ""the Nobel Peace Prize winner"" for the rest of the week. Months later, Dobie-Sarsam said, she was still working to keep up with a flood of media interest in the agency spurred by the award. She said that, four years later, the award still contributes to a feeling of unity among the agency's more-than 2,000 employees who come from over 100 different countries. ""That flush of excitement, unfortunately, it goes away with time,"" she said. ""[But] you do get reminded. You walk through the corridor and you see that certificate hanging -- it's acknowledgement that what we do is incredibly important."" The Nobel recipient receives a prize of 10 million Swedish crowns, or about $1.4 million, another life-changer for many recipients. But Waller said it's the recognition of what the Nobel panel called the ""incalculable value"" of his agency's work that helps when employees are having a hard time with their sometimes slow, frustrating work. ""I think it's a continuing energizer for our staff,"" he said.","Deputy director says Nobel was ""bolt of lightning"" for staff .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Thousands of people were pushing for rescue efforts in Haiti to continue Sunday, after a 24-year-old man was pulled alive from the ruins on Saturday, 11 days after the nation's devastating earthquake. The Haitian government says it will be switching from a search and rescue operation to a search and recovery mission. But families of Americans who were staying at the leveled Hotel Montana are fighting that, and started an online petition Saturday in an effort to continue search efforts there ""until all the survivors are accounted for."" As of Sunday morning, 2,395 people had signed the petition and sent 6,216 messages to the Senate, Congress and the White House, said Sue Keller, a friend of a family whose relatives are among the missing. The families hope to have at least 5,000 signatures by Monday, she said. The Haitian government has said more than 111,000 people died in the January 12 quake, which registered 7.0 in magnitude. But on Saturday, a French rescue team was able to save one life as they pulled Wismond Jean-Pierre from the rubble of the Hotel Napoli Inn in Port-au-Prince. According to his brother, Jean-Pierre worked in the hotel's grocery store and survived his week and a half in the rubble by consuming cookies and beer. Dehydrated but apparently without injury, Jean-Pierre was even talkative as he was placed in an ambulance and driven to a hospital. Lt. Col. Christophe Renou, a French rescuer briefly overcome with emotion, called the three-hour effort ""a miracle."" Other members of the team -- assisted by American and Greek workers -- were seen weeping after Jean-Pierre was freed. Rescues like Jean-Pierre's, and others that have happened in the week following the disaster, sparked hope among families of the missing. But the emotional rescue came on a day when much of Haiti was mourning as operations largely shifted from rescue to recovery, and the country's president attended the funeral of an archbishop who was one of the victims. A Mexican rescue team had pulled the body of 63-year-old Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot from ruins near the national cathedral, which he oversaw as archbishop of Port-au-Prince. The cathedral was destroyed. At the funeral, President RenÃ© PrÃ©val was asked to respond to criticism that he has not shown strong public leadership and has been largely unseen in the aftermath. ""This is not about politics today,"" he said. CNN iReport:  Looking for loved ones in Haiti . The most recent death toll is the worst caused by an earthquake since the 2004 Asian tsunami that resulted from a temblor, and the second-highest death toll from an earthquake in more than three decades, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. ""Rescue teams continue to work in Port-au-Prince, we continue to hope that they will be able to find people still alive, but as time passes, we must gradually shift our resources from rescue to recovery,"" Nick Birnback, spokesman for U.N. peacekeeping operations, said Saturday. International search teams have rescued at least 132 people since the quake struck, the U.N. said. Birnback said the priority now is to remove bodies and clean up affected areas to avoid health hazards and the spread of disease. He said the United Nations will start bringing in heavier equipment, which will allow teams to move concrete and damaged homes. More than 600,000 people have also been left homeless in and around the capital of Port-au-Prince, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Interactive map of where to find aid, hospitals in Haiti . Meanwhile, up to 140 flights a day are regularly arriving at the single-runway Port-au-Prince airport, compared with 25 in the immediate aftermath of the January 12 quake, OCHA said Saturday. To relieve congestion at the airport, humanitarian cargo is being moved to a forward dispatch area at one end of the runway. The Las Americas airport in Santo Domingo, in neighboring Dominican Republic, is starting to report congestion as it becomes increasingly used as an alternative airport, OCHA said. It will now be open overnight to accommodate the extra traffic. Those managing the land transport of supplies from Santo Domingo will need fuel, and OCHA said there is enough in Haiti to last an additional 18 to 19 days. But it said it expects no shortage of fuel because supplies of fuel will be able to enter the port during that time. One concern with cross-border traffic is the unauthorized departure of Haitian children, OCHA said. Charities and aid groups have said in recent days that they are concerned about the danger of child trafficking after the earthquake. Groups including Save the Children and World Vision have called for a halt to adoptions, saying many children may appear to be orphaned but have simply been separated from their families. ""If children must be evacuated from Haiti because their protection needs cannot be met in country, the evacuation must be carefully documented, the children must be registered with the proper authorities and all efforts must be made to reunify them with family before any adoption proceedings are considered,"" the U.S.-based Women's Refugee Commission said. The number of unaccompanied children needing support is greater than the capacity to respond, OCHA said. Authorities are working with unaccompanied children who are being released from hospitals, it said.","24-year-old pulled from hotel ruins 11 days after quake offers hope more are alive .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Troops with the NATO-led force in Afghanistan have seized more than 6,000 pounds of illegal drugs, the force said. Troops found more than 5,300 pounds of processed opium, more than 1,000 pounds of wet opium paste, approximately 50 pounds of heroin, and multiple firearms with ammunition were found in the truck, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said. Authorities arrested two people and destroyed most of the drugs, though they kept some narcotics to analyze. The confiscation took place Wednesday in southern Afghanistan -- in the Maiwand district of Kandahar province -- after troops stopped a ""suspicious"" truck. Afghan opium kills 100,000 people a year worldwide -- more than any other drug -- and the opiate heroin kills five times as many people in NATO countries each year than the total number of NATO troops killed in combat in Afghanistan, a recent U.N. report said. About 15 million people around the world use heroin, opium or morphine, fueling a $65 billion market for the drug and also fueling terrorism and insurgencies. The Taliban raised $450 million to $600 million over the past four years by ""taxing"" opium farmers and traffickers, Antonio Maria Costa, head of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, said in a report last autumn. Not all the money is going into the pockets of rebels or drug dealers, though. Some Afghan officials are making money off the trade as well, he said.","NATO-led troops in Afghanistan seized more than 6,000 pounds of illegal drugs .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than 3,000 U.S. troops scheduled to deploy to Iraq won't go after all, as the military tries to draw down troop levels in the war-torn country, a Pentagon spokesman said Saturday. U.S. troops speak to an Iraqi child in Baghdad on Monday. The 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division will not replace a North Carolina National Guard unit already in Iraq, Lt. Col. Eric Butterbaugh told CNN. The 3,500-troop combat team, based in Fort Drum, New York, was to leave in January, he said. ""[The cancellation] reflects a thorough assessment of the security environment in Iraq and continued improvement in the ability of the Iraqi security forces to safeguard Iraqi citizens and institutions,"" Butterbaugh said. The National Guard unit is still on schedule to return home, which will speed up the drawdown of forces, he said. The troop withdrawal in Iraq coincides with a debate in the Obama administration on whether to send as many as 40,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan. As of Friday, 250 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since the start of the year, according to a CNN tally based on Pentagon numbers. The United States plans to withdraw all its combat troops from Iraq by August, leaving 50,000 in advisory roles. Those advisers are to leave by the end of 2011. Concerns that a delay in the upcoming Iraqi elections could put a dent in scheduled withdrawals was rejected Friday by U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Chris Hill. ""As for our schedule of troop withdrawal, we've been pretty clear about when the troops would be withdrawn,"" he told CNN. ""So our plan is to draw down the troops as we've said we're going [to] do."" The polls are scheduled to open January 16, but both the United States and the United Nations are worried because Iraq still has no election law. If a new law isn't adopted, the government may have to change the election date or rely on the law used in the 2005 elections, some officials say. A vote on the new law is expected Monday. Pentagon officials also must weigh the impact of continuing violence in the country. Hill said the violence is a concern, as are insurgent efforts to undermine attempts at reconciliation in the divided country. ""Reconciliation is a tough business. I mean I've been in some of these meetings with people, you know, they don't like each other, you have to get them to work together, get them to understand their futures are together, and then you get a bombing, which makes it even tougher,"" Hill said. ""Again, I think the Iraqi people have really signaled that they are really sick and tired of this stuff.""  Meanwhile, violence continued in Iraq on Saturday. Four soldiers were killed and 10 people, including civilians and security forces, were wounded when a bomb targeting an Iraqi army checkpoint exploded in Falluja, an Anbar province town, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Elsewhere in Anbar, a suicide truck bomb hit a police checkpoint on a bridge west of Ramadi, wounding a police officer. The blast badly damaged the bridge, which carries a highway linking Iraq with Jordan and Syria, the official said. Traffic had to be rerouted to an another road. Anbar province, a massive region populated mostly by Sunni Arabs, had been a major front in the Iraqi war. The al Qaeda in Iraq militant group once held great sway in Anbar, but its influence lessened with the advent of U.S.-backed groups called Awakening Councils. CNN's Scott Spoerry and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Cancellation reflects improved conditions in Iraq, official said .

"(CNN) -- More than 200 former fighters and other members of the Maoist People's Liberation Army -- including minors -- were discharged from a Maoist camp Thursday in line with Nepal's ongoing peace process, officials said. Those being discharged were part of a group deemed ""disqualified"" by United Nations findings in 2007, which identified at least 4,008 such combatants -- including 2,973 minors. The ""disqualified"" status applied to anyone under the age of 18 who was serving in the liberation army, and those who joined the Maoist group after its 10-year insurgency to abolish the country's monarchy ended in 2006. More than 15,000 died in the fighting and more than 100,000 people were displaced, according to the United Nations Web site. Nepal became a republic in 2008 following elections in which the people voted to abolish the monarchy. ""Those who left the Sindhuli camp today are no more members of the [Maoist] People's Liberation Army,"" Nanda Kishore Pun, commander of the Maoist People's Liberation Army, told CNN in a phone interview from Sindhuli, about 150 km (93 miles) southeast of Kathmandu. The discharge process is expected to end in about a month. As part of the rehabilitation package for the disqualified combatants, the United Nations has offered to provide vocational skills training and education up to high school to those who want such opportunities, but Pun said that these offers are still being discussed. The process of the discharge is seen as in important part of the Nepal's ongoing peace process. The Maoists and other political parties in the country are discussing ways to integrate the 19,602 verified Maoist combatants into Nepal's security forces -- a move that made up part of the peace deal signed in 2006 to bring the peace process to a conclusion. Once the minors remain out of the command and control of the Maoist military structure for six months to a year, the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (UCPN-M) can be considered for removal from the list of parties that recruit and use children, which is included in the annual U.N. Secretary-General's report on Children and Armed Conflict. As the discharge and rehabilitation process began, about a dozen of the disqualified combatants were listed as being under the age of 16 and about 500 were under the age of 18. Though called combatants, the United Nations said the minors were used as messengers, cooks and porters during the fighting.","More than 200 people were discharged from Maoist camp in Nepal .

"Editor's note: Watch the full interview with Serena Williams on ""Your $$$$$"" Saturday at 1 p.m. ET and Sunday at 3 p.m. ET on CNN. Serena Williams says she believes she apologized for her actions promptly and completely. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Serena Williams just wants to move on. But the controversy around her obscenity-laced tirade at a line judge at the U.S. Open continues. Williams, 27, said she was ""in the moment"" and doesn't really remember her now-famous outburst at a line judge who had called a foot fault. It was a 12-second verbal attack that has played over and over for three days. ""It was a really tough point in the match and it was really close and got a really tough call that wasn't the correct call, and, you know, things got a little heated and I had a conversation with the line judge that didn't go so well,"" Williams said. Williams, ranked No. 2 in the world by the Women's Tennis Association, said she does not recall moments of Saturday's incident but believes she apologized for her actions promptly and completely.  Watch Williams talk about call Â» . ""I couldn't apologize any sooner, and then also I learned from my mistakes ... I was talking to [former Giants defensive end] Michael Strahan earlier today and he said how, when he's out there you're so intense. Obviously, when you get a bad call, it's like 'What's going on?' So when you're in the moment, you are just there. You don't really quite remember exactly what's going on,"" Williams said. Williams found herself explaining her outburst while promoting her recently published memoir, ""On the Line,"" in which she details growing up the youngest of five sisters, her struggles on the court and off, and her positive messages of inspiration, especially to her younger fans. ""Those kids probably just need to know it's great to be a competitor, how passionate someone is, and just making the right decisions at the right time -- realizing that, hey, everyone falls, 'Wow, she's human, she made a bad decision, a bad choice.' "" Williams added, ""I am not a robot. I have a heart and I bleed."" In the aftermath of Saturday's match, tournament officials fined Williams $10,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and $500 for smashing a racket during the same event. So far, no suspensions have been served, but the United States Tennis Association has said that it has launched an investigation into the incident.","Tennis star's obscenity-laced tirade at the U.S. Open stays in the spotlight .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing in Afghanistan last month that killed seven CIA employees and contractors and a Jordanian military officer, according to a statement posted on Islamist Web sites. Mustafa Abu Yazid, al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan and its No. 3 man, said the attack avenged the death of Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Taliban in Pakistan who was killed in a missile strike last August, and al Qaeda operatives Saleh al-Somali and Abdullah al-Libi. The December 30 blast at a U.S. base in Khost, in southeastern Afghanistan, killed seven CIA operatives including two from private security firm Xe, formerly known as Blackwater. The eighth victim was Jordanian Army Capt. Sharif Ali bin Zeid, a cousin of Jordan's King Abdullah II. A former U.S. intelligence official identified the suicide bomber as Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, a Jordanian doctor who acted as a double agent. He was recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source, according to a senior Jordanian official. U.S. sources said bin Zeid was the Jordanian operative working closely with al-Balawi, who was from the same hometown as the onetime leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed that al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's No. 2 figure, the former intelligence official said. The al Qaeda statement posted Wednesday identified al-Balawi as Hamam Khalil Mohammed Abu Malal, who used the name Abu Dujana Khorasani. It said Abu Dujana was a well-known Islamist author and a preacher on jihadi Web sites, an immigrant for his faith and a fighter who sacrificed himself and his money for his God and belief. ""May God accept him as a martyr who was able to infiltrate the Americans' forts,"" the statement said. ""We ask God to bless the people who follow your path, Abu Dujana,"" it said. ""Let them know that your brothers are following your path and they will not have peace of mind until they slaughter the Americans and let the Islamic nation be proud for having men like you among its sons."" Several groups have claimed responsibility for the attack, one of the worst blows ever to America's intelligence community. Some analysts said that militant groups may be competing for credit to spread the word and attract fresh donations and recruits. In a posting on its Web site last week, the Taliban in Afghanistan claimed that the bomber was an Afghan National Army soldier. On Sunday, however, Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud said in an e-mail that his arm of the Islamic movement carried out the attack, also citing the reason as revenge for Baitullah Mehsud's killing.","Al Qaeda claims responsibility for last month's Afghanistan bombing, say Islamist Web sites .

"(CNN) -- French police were searching Friday for a Degas painting stolen from a Marseilles museum a day earlier. ""Les Choristes,"" or ""The Chorus,"" is worth about â¬800,000, or $1.15 million, Marseilles Police Commissioner Xavier Claudel told CNN. The 1877 pastel was on loan to the Musee Cantini from the Musee d'Orsay in Paris for an exhibition, Claudel said. It was discovered missing when staff opened the museum Thursday, he said. Investigators were going through surveillance camera footage for clues, but Claudel said he could not offer any more information about the case. Edgar Degas was a prominent member of the the Impressionists and produced a vast amount of artwork before his death in 1917 at age 83. His style, subject matter and artistic sensibility set him apart from his contemporaries, according to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.","The 1877 pastel was on loan to Musee Cantini from Musee d'Orsay in Paris .

"London, England (CNN) -- Snow and freezing temperatures hit large parts of Britain Wednesday, forcing airports and railway lines to close down, and forecasters warned that more bad weather was on the way. Most of Britain was covered in snow, with 20 to 30 centimeters (nearly 8 to nearly 12 inches) of snow in the southern parts, and up to 15 feet in the Pennines, the mountain range that runs from northern England north to Scotland. Four airports, including London's Gatwick, were shut down because of snow and ice. Gatwick said 84 flights were canceled, mainly on British Airways and EasyJet. Bristol, Blackpool, and Exeter airports were also closed. iReport: A snowy day in Chertsey, Surrey . British Airways was forced to cancel ""dozens"" of flights in and out of London's Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 due to snow and ice, a spokesman told CNN Wednesday. Both incoming and outbound flights were experiencing significant delays, the spokesman said. BA operates about 400 flights a day in and out of Terminal 5, the airport's newest wing. According to BAA Limited, the company that operates the British airports, Heathrow ""overall is fine,"" as the facility was alternating runways to keep cancellations to a minimum. Stansted Airport in north London was briefly closed but reopened at midday. Still, it reported 27 flight cancellations. Manchester Airport, which was shut Tuesday, was reopened. Officials said snow was unlikely to affect flights, but warned travelers to expect delays because of Tuesday's flight cancelations. All major train lines were open, but some train operators were running restricted services because of the weather. They included South West Trains, which runs services between London and some of the hardest-hit areas, such as Hampshire, Surrey and Wiltshire, and Chiltern Railways, which runs between London and Birmingham. Virgin Trains said it planned a regular service, but it warned of the risk of delays and cancelations on routes between London and Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland. Trains in northern England and Scotland were suffering because of the snow. There were no services between the Scottish cities of Inverness and Perth, National Rail said, and no trains between the English cities of Sheffield and Leeds. Frigid temperatures batter the U.S. south . Britain's Highways Agency warned of difficult driving conditions in central southern England and the north of the country. It urged drivers to delay non-essential trips. Dozens of cars were left sitting on the side of the road in Southampton, near England's southern coast, after drivers became stuck in snow. The Highways Agency warned drivers to avoid the nearby A3 highway, which runs between London and Portsmouth, because of weather conditions. The agency said it was doing continuous salt treatment and snow plowing on major roadways in England. Schools were closed across the country because of the heavy snowfall. Officials said 176 schools were shut in Buckinghamshire and 164 were closed in Oxfordshire just to the northwest of London. About 330 schools in Gloucestershire, 200 in Somerset, and 143 in Wiltshire were closed because of snow, officials said. Hundreds of schools were also closed in Kent, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Coventry, Bath, Windsor, Maidenhead, Liverpool, and Brighton, officials said.

"In Fad-Free Nutrition, exclusively on CNN.com, the editors of Cooking Light help you digest the latest diet and food news and trends. The recent recall of industrial peanut butter and products that contain it sparked nationwide concern about the safety of eating many popular snack products. That's understandable, considering the average American consumes 3.3 pounds of peanut butter each year, according to USDA data. Pistachios, pecans, hazelnuts, almonds, and others can be made into tasty spreads and put in recipes. While consuming with caution is always prudent, it's important not to give up on nuts and peanuts (which are actually legumes) entirely. They offer numerous health benefits and can even help dieters stay on track. Consuming just one ounce of nuts -- of any variety -- up to five times a week in place of other calories consumed is likely to help reduce the risk of heart disease. Although nuts are high in calories, they contain heart-healthy mono- and polyunsaturated fats, and they're jam-packed with nutrients such as vitamin E, folate, niacin, copper, magnesium, and potassium. Plus, they have some protein and fiber to help keep you feeling satisfied. Learn more about the health benefits of nuts (plus recipes that use them) at CookingLight.com. Tips on smart snacking . If you are worried about buying peanut butter based on the recent salmonella scare, try these tasty and nutritious alternative ways to snack safely: . 1. Make your own spread. Although major national brands of jarred peanut butter have not been recalled, it's a fun and nutritious option to make your own. At certain grocery stores, such as some locations of Whole Foods Market, you can grind peanuts to make fresh peanut butter. In less than one minute, you have a fresh, peanutty spread without preservatives or added sugar. You can also make fresh peanut butter at home; all you need are plain roasted peanuts and a food processor. Put Â¾ cup plain roasted peanuts in a food processor; process two minutes or until smooth. See our staff's tips on making homemade nut butters on our blog, Test Kitchen Secrets. 2. Get creative. Use fresh peanut butter to upgrade homemade versions of snacks that may have been recalled. For example, spread a teaspoon of peanut butter on a whole-grain cracker instead of purchasing ready-made peanut butter crackers. You might surprise yourself by creating a better-for-you treat, such as our lightened peanut buttery Swag Bars. 3. Branch out beyond peanut butter. Almond, cashew, macadamia, walnut, and hazelnut butters are unaffected by the recall. They all offer a strong nutrition profile. For example, 2 tablespoons of almond butter (one serving) provide the following: . â¢ Almost half your daily needs of the antioxidant vitamin E with 6.5 milligrams . â¢ About one-third of a day's worth of magnesium (97 milligrams), a mineral that supports muscle function and bone tissue . â¢ 243 milligrams of potassium (about five percent of one day's allotment), which helps keep your blood pressure levels steady . Visit CookingLight.com to learn more about other nutritious nut butters made from cashews, almonds, macadamia nuts, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts -- including how to make them, and healthful recipes that put them to delicious use.

"(CNN) -- Four people died and another three were missing Monday after two avalanches in the Swiss Alps, Bern police said. The avalanches occurred at 11:30 a.m. (5:30 a.m. ET) and about noon Sunday in the Diemtigen Valley, 34 miles (55 km) south of Bern, said Thomas Jauch, a spokesman for police in Bern County. In the first incident an avalanche buried one person who was with a party of eight cross-country skiers, Jauch said. A nearby party of 25 skiers joined in the search and a physician, who was a member of a ski rescue team, was dropped into the area by one of two helicopters called in to help. As they were searching for the missing skier, a second avalanche buried 10 to 12 of them, Jauch said. Nine were found alive, one was dead, he said. Three of the survivors died later in hospital, he added. The doctor was among the dead, he said. It was not clear whether the original skier who was buried was among the survivors. ""It was not a high-risk day; not a high-risk situation,"" Jauch said. Search efforts were suspended Monday because of the weather in the mountains. ""There could be another avalanche,"" the police spokesman said.","Avalanches occurred Sunday in the Diemtigen Valley, 34 miles (55 km) south of Bern .
