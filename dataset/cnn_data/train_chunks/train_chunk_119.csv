"(CNN) -- Venezuela will nationalize the exploration and mining of gold and recall $11 billion in gold reserves from foreign banks, President Hugo Chavez said Wednesday. ""We are going to start bringing the gold to our national bank,"" Chavez said in a conference call with several of the nation's financial leaders broadcast on state television. He added that Venezuela should diversify its investments, placing more of its reserves in countries such as Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa. ""The time has come. The economies of Europe and the United States are sinking. Now we must see that the economies of China, Russia and Brazil are more solid,"" he said. Venezuelan leaders did not specify when they would begin bringing back gold reserves. ""'We want to protect our assets that belong to the Venezuelan people,"" said Nelson Merentes, president of Central Bank of Venezuela, according to the state-run AVN news agency. ""We are going to do it gradually, using a technique used worldwide to bring the gold, because they are physical bars that were deposited and we must certify that they are the same ones."" Chavez detailed the gold reserves plan hours after announcing that he planned to issue a decree that will permit the takeover of a gold-rich area in southern Venezuela, according to AVN. Chavez said that the nationalization was necessary ""because in that area there is anarchy, there are mafias, smugglers."" Venezuela has as much as $12 billion in gold reserves, Chavez said, and ""we cannot permit them to keep taking that from us."" The Venezuelan leader said the moves would bring more money and stability to Venezuela. But at least one critic argued that Chavez was acting in his own self interest and placing the nation's resources at risk. Roger Noriega, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state, urged Venezuelans to rally ""to oppose the looting of the nation's savings"" in a blog post on the website of the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank. Chavez and other leaders ""are more concerned with their own fate than for the well-being of the Venezuelan people,"" he wrote.","""We are going to start bringing the gold to our national bank,"" Chavez says .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez heads home Thursday after undergoing five days of medical tests in Cuba. Chavez made the announcement on state-run VTV on Wednesday night. Once home, Chavez said he will make a religious trip to the state of Tachira, which borders Colombia. ""Well, we will return tomorrow,"" he told the station. ""At noon we will be there, God willing. We will depart early. We will go to the Santo Cristo de la Grita to pay for a promise I made."" Chavez did not elaborate on the trip. Chavez has been in Cuba for undisclosed medical tests since Saturday. In June, he announced that doctors in Cuba had removed a cancerous tumor from his body. He has not said what type of cancer he has. The president has undergone treatments in both Venezuela and Cuba. Last month, the president was in Cuba for what he said was his fourth and possibly final round of chemotherapy. Chavez has pledged to run for re-election next year, dismissing speculation that his illness would force him out of politics.","Chavez announced in June that he has cancer .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN)  -- Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and leaders of a massive Indian protest plan to meet Sunday in the city of Cali. Protesters march this week along the Pan-American Highway in Villarrica, Colombia. The president spoke by phone Thursday evening with one protest leader, Daniel Pinacue, and said he looked forward to ""comprehensive and constructive"" dialogue, the Colombian government said. Tens of thousands of Indians are marching from the mountains of southwest Colombia to Cali, a city of 2 million, to demand more land, better education and health care and protection from corporations encroaching on their ancestral land. Colombia's 1.3 million Indians rank among the most impoverished of the country's 40 million people. Protesters and police have clashed since demonstrations began October 10. At least four demonstrators have been killed and 130 wounded, Indian leaders said. They have accused government security forces of shooting at them.  Watch as violence has marred the two-week-old struggle » . Authorities have denied the allegations and said some Indians have hurled rocks, thrown Molotov cocktails and homemade explosives at security forces. As many as 70 security force members, mainly riot police, have been hurt, the government has said. Authorities also said some Indians have shot fellow demonstrators to stir up the crowd's anger. After initially denying such accusations, Uribe admitted Wednesday that police had fired on Indian demonstrators last week despite a government pledge that security forces would not do so. ""The police did fire,"" Uribe said at a news conference after CNN obtained and aired a videotape that shows police at La Maria Indian reservation October 16 in southwestern Colombia.  Watch as Uribe apologizes » . The patrolman who fired, Uribe said, was being attacked with explosives. His supervisors did not know he fired, the president said. The Indians who have been killed died as a result of their explosives and not police bullets, Uribe said. ""This is a resistance movement,"" said protester Rodrigo Quira. ""We don't agree with President Uribe's policies, and other groups are affected, too. That's why they're joining us."" The demonstrators have snaked along the Pan-American Highway, a major trade route in South America. They occasionally play traditional Indian songs that date to the time of the Spanish conquest, when many Indians across South and Central America died as a result of imported disease, slavery and warfare. ""I believe we have to forge strong alliances in our struggle to demand our rights,"" said Aida Quilcue, an Indian leader. A member of Colombia's riot police force said, ""The Indians are the worst because they're fighting with Molotov cocktails, gunpowder [in homemade explosives] and machetes."" In the five-minute phone call between Uribe and Pinacue, the president said both sides should talk this weekend ""with a spirit of brotherhood,"" according to the Colombian government.","President Alvaro Uribe ready for ""constructive"" dialogue, government says .

"(CNN)  -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez told reporters Wednesday that his country's embassy in Libya's capital was ""attacked and plundered."" Chavez demanded respect and protection for his country's ambassador and embassy staff, and condemned the ""imperial insanity"" that he said was behind the ""destruction"" of the North African nation, Venezuela's state-run VTV reported. ""The drama of Libya does not even end with the fall of (Moammar) Gadhafi's government,"" Chavez said. ""It is only beginning."" Chavez and Gadhafi are close allies. The Venezuelan president has spoken out numerous times since the unrest erupted in Libya, accusing the United States and other countries of blowing the situation out of proportion to justify an invasion.

"(CNN) -- A former leader of Mexico's Tijuana drug cartel was sentenced Monday in the United States to 25 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $100 million after pleading guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to launder money, officials said. Benjamin Arellano Felix pleaded guilty to the charges in January in U.S. federal court in San Diego. ""Today's sentencing marks the end of Mr. Arellano-Felix's reign as the leader of one of the most dangerous drug and organized crime organizations our agencies have ever investigated,"" San Diego FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Eric Birnbaum said in a statement. U.S., Mexico, Canada discuss ways to fight drug cartels . Arellano Felix was one of seven brothers who ran the cartel, also known as the Arellano Felix Organization, until he and the majority of the leadership were arrested. During its peak in the 1990s and early 2000s, the cartel controlled the flow of cocaine, marijuana and other drugs into the United States through Tijuana and Mexicali. ""I was disappointed,"" Nicholas De Pento, an attorney representing Arellano Felix, said about Monday's sentencing. ""We have to look at our options, but the plea agreement that I took over has a waiver of appeal ... my hands are sort of tied."" De Pento said he was brought into the case less than two weeks ago. Gunmen kill five police officers in Ciudad Juarez . In addition to trafficking drugs, the cartel under Arellano Felix's leadership ran a network known for bribes, spies and killings, according to the Mexican attorney general's office. He was considered the brains and accountant for the organization, the agency said. Arellano Felix has been convicted of organized crime activities in Mexico and served nine years there before being brought to the United States last year. He was arrested in 2002 in the state of Puebla. Extradition processes against him began in 2007. ""Today's prison sentence virtually ensures that Arellano-Felix will spend the remainder of his life in custody. Following this sentence, he will be deported to Mexico to finish a 22-year sentence. This is a fitting end for a person who has caused so much suffering and destruction,"" said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A strong 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck southern Mexico on Saturday night, about 100 miles south-southwest of the capital, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake, which hit at 7:47 p.m. local time, had an estimated depth of 40 miles, the USGS said. The agency earlier said it was 6.7 magnitude. There were no immediate reports of major damage in the capital, but several areas were without power, Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard wrote on his Twitter page. No injuries were reported in the quake, located in Guerrero state. Some startled residents in Mexico City ran out of their houses and into the streets. Loud sirens sounded.

"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- Two U.S. citizens -- a mother and her son --- have been killed in the violence-plagued Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, authorities said. Rosa Williams, 35, and her son, Pablo Noe, 19, were among four people who were killed by assailants armed with an AK-47 rifle and 9 mm pistol who opened fire on a blue 2004 Dodge Durango SUV in which they were riding, said Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Authorities identified them in a statement issued Monday. They identified the other two victims as Alberto Nieto Nieto, 24, and Alma Yesenia Flores, 21. The attack happened Saturday in front of dozens of witnesses on a busy road in Ciudad Juarez, which is just across the U.S.-Mexico border from El Paso, Texas. Investigators have not determined a motive for the shooting. Juarez is considered a flash point in Mexico's nearly five-year-long war on organized crime. The U.S. Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez issued a warning this year for American citizens in the city and other parts of the state of Chihuahua. The message cautions that recent successes against drug cartel figures could put Americans in Mexico at risk.","A mother and her son were killed in an ambush .

"(CNN) -- For more than 20 years, CNN Hero Sal Dimiceli has helped people going through hard times. Through his newspaper column and his nonprofit, the Time Is Now to Help, Dimiceli has assisted about 500 people a year with food, rent, utilities and other necessities. He has also been known to chip in his own money to salvage people's personal belongings -- items that have deep meaning for the people who reach out to him. CNN Heroes producer Kathleen Toner recently spoke with Dimiceli about his work, which included helping a woman so desperate for cash that she pawned her wedding ring. Kathleen Toner: You've been doing this for a long time. How has the current economic downturn impacted the people you're helping? Sal Dimiceli: The recession has hit this area (Lake Geneva, Wisconsin) pretty hard, as it has all across America. I'm finding more and more people in desperate need. They're struggling to stay in their homes, their apartments. They're struggling to put food on the table and struggling to keep their utilities on. Behind closed doors, they tell their neighbors they're fine. They'd sooner go in the house and starve. ... Those that are in dire need, they'll sell all their personal belongings to survive. And when they're in that survival mode, they'll sell anything. Toner: How do you react when you come across someone who's sold something very personal? Dimiceli: I just recently found someone who sold her wedding band that (she) had for 24 years. When you find out something like that, that's so emotional, I think it's very important to dip into my own pocket to bring that back to her. ... I want to give them their self-esteem back. ... They need to hang onto parts of their life. Sentimental things are very important. Video: The story of the pawned wedding ring . Toner: How did it make you feel to help her get that back? Dimiceli: It's heartwarming, energizing. ... Feeding (people), turning on the electric, giving them a place to live -- moments like that absolutely keep me going. It's a lot easier, once somebody gives a helping hand, to get organized to do better. ... We're turning tears into smiles. Toner: You mentioned ""we."" Tell me about this volunteer network that you've built. Dimiceli: The Time Is Now to Help has gotten to a point where we have hundreds of volunteers. Helping is very contagious, because once you do it, you feel so good about helping a fellow human being that you want to do it again. The volunteers, they give their time helping (the elderly and the disabled) with shopping, bringing people to doctors. ... Sometimes we even provide jobs, because there's always somebody that knows somebody that needs somebody. We connect the dots and get the people so they're helping themselves. ... That's what America's all about . Toner: Why do you do this? Dimiceli: I grew up in poverty, and as a little boy I stood by and watched my mother cry when our lights were off or we had no food or we were constantly being evicted like gypsies. I was helpless. I didn't know what to do. And there was something deep inside of me -- I wanted to stop that pain. I am still driven by those moments. ... I want to stop the pain in all those out there that are suffering.

"(CNN) -- Surrounded by gang violence in her Chicago neighborhood, Diane Latiker opened her home to area youth and started a community program called Kids Off the Block. Since 2003, Latiker's nonprofit has taught valuable life skills and provided recreational activities to more than 1,500 young people. CNN recently asked Latiker for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero? Diane Latiker: I was just finishing up a meeting at Kids Off the Block. I cannot explain the feeling when they told me about my selection. Euphoria hit me smack-dead in the head! I was elated and felt so honored. I couldn't help but feel humble, as I know there are so many others like me who are giving their lives to help others. I cried and cried. Thank you all so much! CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to Kids Off the Block? Latiker: This honor validates that organizations such as ours are needed and appreciated. I hope being a Top 10 CNN Hero will give us the platform to further our mission of saving youth. Our community is plagued by violence, hopelessness and negativity. CNN has replaced all that with hope. Our organization's staff, volunteers, youth and the community -- all of us here -- will share it, and it will make the world a better place for generations to come. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero? Latiker: I want to buy this (building) that we're in right now. We're growing with so many kids. Buying the building will help us serve thousands of young people. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Latiker: What I want people to know is that the work that I and so many others do can literally be the difference between life and death for a generation that seems to have lost all hope. Deciding eight years ago to open my life to others has enriched not only my life, but the lives of hundreds of young people. This proves to me that giving hope to others is the key to changing lives. For that I am grateful. I know I'm only one person, but I believe in the power of one. I really do. I believe that I can do things and I can change people. And it's been working. If I can make a change in a generation, then my community's going to get better -- because they're going to be the ones that take it over. Read the full story on CNN Hero Diane Latiker: .

"(CNN) -- In the first three months of this year, there were 73 homicides in Chicago -- and nearly half the victims were 25 or younger. Gang violence is especially rampant in the Roseland neighborhood that CNN Hero Diane Latiker calls home. But she's on a crusade to make her community safer for its youth. Latiker started a nonprofit program called Kids Off the Block, which has been giving young people an alternative to street life since 2003. Latiker, 54, recently spoke with CNN's Allie Torgan about the stone memorial she created in Roseland. The stones in the memorial represent each local youth who has been killed in recent years. Allie Torgan: Why did you create this memorial, and what inspired it? Diane Latiker: The whole purpose of it being there is to shock the community and shock the young people that we're losing a generation to themselves. Blair Holt was killed in May of 2007. He was on the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) bus coming from Julian High School. A 14-year-old got on the bus with a gun and sprayed the bus. Blair Holt, he jumped over the girl next to him to save her life. And he was killed. I was in Home Depot the day before his funeral, and I saw these stones and they looked like little headstones. And I said, ""Wow, that would really get people's attention if we put their names on (them)."" Blair Holt was the first name that we put on a stone, and we put it on a little memorial and put the stones on there. It grew from those 30 stones to 220 right now. And we're 150 stones behind. This memorial says more than there's a generation dying. It says, ""What are we doing?"" I know what we're doing. We're being silent. Where are we as adults? Why don't we question them and say, ""What's making you angry?"" Torgan: What is Kids Off the Block doing to keep the headstone numbers from growing? Latiker: I tell kids when they walk through the doors, ""This is a peace place, this is a safe place."" We've had six gangs in my living room at one time. ... But that was the safe place. And you know what? They respected that. They could sit down together, they could eat together and they could talk about their problems together because (the rule) was set when they came in the door. We're here to help. We're not here to judge. We listen. I listen to young people. That's the only way they're going to listen to me. All of them are not gang-bangers. All of them are not dropouts. But the ones that are, they need our help. I believe that I can do things and I can change people. And it's been working, because there's a generation that believes in what I'm talking about. You see that they've done something. And then they start helping you, and they start helping their families. And the gangs don't seem so important anymore. Or the guns. School seems important. And a job. That's what keeps me going. Torgan: Tell me about Roseland and your hopes for its future. Latiker: Roseland, right now, is in economic stress. The environment feels very hopeless, especially for young people. It's blighted: a lot of vacant lots, abandoned buildings, crime. But it's a community on the rebound, and it's because there are people here who care. I thought about moving. But I decided not to. I'm not going anywhere. If more of us came outside, we wouldn't be scared. I figure I can make a change. If I can make a change in a generation, then my community's going to get better because they're going to be the ones that take it over. I believe Roseland's going to bounce back.

"(CNN) -- A China-EU summit ended Tuesday with promises for more support from Beijing for debt-straddled Europe, yet no concrete cash pledges to buy euro debt. It's becoming a familiar scenario in the wake of the eurozone crisis. Indebted nations have made repeated entreaties to Chinese leaders for bail out help in the form of buying government debt bonds or direct investment. And, indeed, Beijing has pledged to help, and Chinese investment in European companies has skyrocketed. Still, Beijing bristles at accepting the ""white knight"" role European leaders clearly hope China will play. In a joint press conference with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said, ""China is firm in supporting the EU side in dealing with the debt problems. We match our words with actions."" However, Wen added that it was up to debt-stricken nations -- such as Greece, which approved tough budget cuts ordered by the EU amid escalating violence in Athens -- and the EU to reduce its debt risks, echoing previous statements from China during the crisis. ""The debt crisis relies fundamentally on the efforts made by the EU itself,"" Wen said. Why is EU seeking Chinese help? Simply put, China has the money. For three decades Beijing has averaged double-digit annual growth. Even in the wake of the financial crisis, China's economic output dipped to a low of 8.7% in 2009 -- albeit buttressed by a $600 billion government stimulus package. China, thanks to its extraordinary trade build-up in the past three decades, has amassed the world's largest bank of foreign currency reserves at nearly $3.2 trillion. Encouraging China to buy bonds for Greece or EU debt would not only help the nations, but would bolster market sentiment for purchasing the bonds, and could help bring down borrowing costs for Europe. Why is China reluctant to help? On Monday, China central bank advisor Xia Bin was at a Beijing economics forum. When asked by reporters about investment in European debt he said: ""We may be poor, but we aren't stupid,"" according to Reuters. ""We must follow commercial principles in making such investments. That means we want returns."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a visit to China earlier this month, had lobbied China Investment Corp., the state-owned $410 billion sovereign wealth fund, to invest in euro debt bonds. But CIC Chairman Lou Jiwei said Monday that the fund wouldn't invest in European government bonds. Yet in a speech Wednesday, Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said Beijing would continue to invest in European government debt. The Chinese public, however, isn't interested in playing the EU's white knight. And China is facing a credit crisis of its own -- albeit writ small -- in a number of mid-tier cities such as Wenzhou as once red-hot property markets cool. In Chinese city, lenders outraged as bosses flee . ""I think domestically it's very difficult for them to make that type of commitment from a political point of view,"" John Quelch, dean of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, told CNN. ""And to publicly do that when there is considerable need domestically would be very tough."" Why does the EU matter to Beijing? The mixed messages from Beijing on helping the EU come after an International Monetary Fund report last week said fallout from the eurozone crisis could cut China's growth rate in half in 2012, underlying the importance of the EU market to China. According to figures released by Eurostat this week, China was the EU's second biggest trading partner after the U.S. in the first 10 months of 2011. Clearly, China's financial fate is closely linked to the future of its trading partners. ""China has quietly behind the scenes been supporting the euro significantly in terms of shifting and rebalancing its foreign reserves,"" Quelch said. Chinese companies are increasingly investing in Europe. According to A Capital's Dragon Index, Europe was the top destination in 2011 for investment -- a total of $10.4 billion in 2011, up from $4.1 billion the year before. Research from the China Europe International Business School suggests that within 10 years, China will invest $1 trillion in Europe -- but it will likely be more in the form of direct investment in companies rather than buying government debt, Quench said.","An EU-China summit ended with promises to help, but no cash pledge .
China has the world's largest foreign cash reserves of about $3.2 trillion .
Domestically, there is little political support in China to rescue the eurozone .
China investment in European companies, however, has skyrocketed ."

"(CNN) -- Actor-director Gary Sinise has touched the lives of thousands of U.S. service members. Sinise often travels overseas to honor and entertain the troops with his Lt. Dan Band, and his Gary Sinise Foundation helps support them when they return home. CNN's Denise Quan recently spoke with Sinise about CNN Heroes and his philanthropy, which also assists civilian first responders. Below are excerpts from that interview. Denise Quan: What is the Gary Sinise Foundation? Gary Sinise: Over the past 10 or so years, I have been very active with a lot of military charities, a lot of first-responder charities. ... It became clear that, in order for me to continue at the pace that I'm at without having to travel all the time, I needed an entity that I could use to draw in funds and point people in the right direction with regard to military and first-responder support. Quan: Why is this cause important to you? Sinise: I have veterans in my family. On my wife's side, I have Vietnam veterans. I remember all too well what happened to them when they came home from war. On my side, I have veterans. My dad was in the Navy, my uncles were in World War II, and my grandfather served in World War I. I have great respect for our veterans. And then I played one in ""Forrest Gump"" and I got involved with the Disabled American Veterans organization, and I became keenly aware of what people who lose their limbs and parts of their body have sacrificed in service of their country. So I feel it's important to keep them strong and do what I can to let them know that I'm a grateful American for what they provide, which is freedom for me and my children. Quan: How did the Lt. Dan Band get started? Sinise: I started taking a group of musicians with me to visit our troops in 2004. Prior to that, I would just go out and shake hands and take pictures and sign autographs and just pat them on the back and say ""thank you"" and sit down to have dinner with them -- just let them know they were appreciated. And eventually I asked the USO if they would let me take a group of musicians so I could entertain the troops at the same time, and they said ""sure."" I happened to have these guys that I played with out of Chicago. And my buddy Kimo Williams and I put some more guys and gals together, and we have a band of 13 people now. It's a big, big show. We've been all over the world several times. We probably will do 14, 15 USO shows this year alone. It's a good feeling to see the smiles on these people's faces. When I go over to Afghanistan, for example, and you're out there in the war zone and you bring those people together and you play for them, it's a great feeling to see them having a great time. Quan: What was it about CNN Heroes that made you want to be a part of it? Sinise: It's highlighting average Americans and what they do on a daily basis to serve and to give back. I'm glad CNN has created the Heroes project, because it's something that makes you feel good when you see what can be done and what people are doing out there in the shadows. A lot of people don't know the extraordinary sacrifice and service of certain people. And when these kinds of things are highlighted through a campaign like this, I think it gives incentive to other people: ""Hey, wait a minute. There are things I can do in my community, even if it's small."" Sinise and his band's efforts to support the troops are chronicled in the documentary ""Lt. Dan Band: For the Common Good.""","Acclaimed actor Gary Sinise: I'm grateful for the freedom that our troops provide .

"(CNN) -- George Lopez is helping to create positive change for underprivileged children, adults and military families. In 2009, he started The Lopez Foundation, which provides and supports education and health programs for those in need. The group also increases awareness about kidney disease and organ donation. Lopez underwent a kidney transplant in 2005. Lopez was a presenter at ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" in 2009. CNN's Denise Quan recently spoke with him about CNN Heroes and his own charity's efforts. Below are excerpts from that interview. Denise Quan: How do you feel about the work that the CNN Heroes are doing? George Lopez: For people who are in show business, so many times we get rewarded for being in a movie or being in a television show. But these are the unsung heroes who are out there, rain or shine. Nothing is more powerful to them but to help. The one thing that connects all the Heroes is their intent is to help. And it's almost like hands across the world: You're touching people that need help in your area, but yet it's bigger than that -- it's global. It's what people do to maintain our humanity. Quan: What prompted you to start The Lopez Foundation? Lopez: I received my kidney transplant six years ago and have been healthier than I have ever been in my life. And it's inspired me to give back and to create the foundation and to make a difference in the lives of those people in need. I started The Lopez Foundation in December of 2009, and the mission is to create positive and permanent change for underprivileged children, adults and, very importantly, military families, as well as increasing the awareness of kidney disease and organ donation. Quan: What's rewarding about your work with the foundation? Lopez: When I have the kidney camp, it's always the highlight. I have a summer camp, and it's amazing to see how children will respond when they're given the opportunity to just be regular kids. They get to run into kids who are also experiencing the same issues that they have, whether it's dialysis or kidney disease. They talk about taking their medicine. They also realize that whether they are the only person sick in their family or their school, they are not alone. Quan: You support CNN Hero Jorge Munoz and his efforts to feed the hungry. What is it about his work that moved you? Lopez: People who are homeless ... they're not all addicts. A lot of times, they're just people who, through something like losing their job or losing someone in their life, ended up on the streets. So much of our time is spent in cars that sometimes you need to look out of those windows.

"(CNN) -- Country music star Wynonna Judd is a supporter of the Wounded Warrior Project, an organization that helps injured service members and their families. She recently spoke with CNN's Sonya Hamasaki about the need to support individuals who've served in the military, especially those who have been injured in the line of duty. Below are excerpts from that interview. Sonya Hamasaki: Why are you committed to helping wounded warriors and their families? Wynonna Judd: I think these men and women have this ability that I don't know if I'd ever be able to have. They have a passion and a commitment ... that is bigger than anything I've ever seen. In wartime and in peacetime, these families are what I think of as the true example of the American way. Community. Loyalty. Fellowship. Commitment. My passion, besides being a proud American, is to be a supporter, to be a part of these families, because they've changed my life by giving me a reason to sing. Hamasaki: Injuries have forever altered the lives of these men and women. How does the Wounded Warrior Project help them? Judd: I think the thing to remember is that this woundedness does not take a holiday. These families are forever changed because these men and women have put their butts on the line to fight for freedom, which ain't free, baby. Wounded Warrior Project is giving back to that man or woman who has gone over and put their life on the line and been wounded. The support that surrounds these warriors is that of rehabilitation physically, support groups mentally, and just a sense of community. There are all kinds of programs that are giving these families hope. Hamasaki: How do you help? Judd: Part of (my music's) proceeds go to Wounded Warrior Project, which is an absolute American dream. I'm constantly aware that my part in this is to be there to support them, to be a backdrop of everyday life for these families. This music that I sing -- that all of country music brings especially -- is a support for our nation as well as these families. Hamasaki: What is a hero to you? Judd: I think the word ""hero"" describes people who strive for excellence no matter what the job is. They're not standing in front of 20,000 people getting applause like I do. They're simply doing it because it's the right thing to do.","Wynonna Judd is committed to helping wounded U.S. troops and their families .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As Hollywood stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Penelope Cruz grace the red carpet at the 52nd London Film Festival, the UK's capital city shows it has become a thriving, creative hub for filmmaking. American actor, singer and drag-performer Rue Paul at the 22nd Lesbian and Gay Film festival. There are no fewer than 12 film festivals in London, ranging from the London Korean Film Festival to a films showcase from lesbian and gay directors. ""The Screening Room"" takes a look at some of the festivals making waves in and around London. Canary Wharf Film Festival (CWFF) Since his film appeared at this little known London festival, director Charles Duke has gained prominence and his film was accepted at the Cannes Film Festival. Duke shot his comedic short ""Caution, Wet Paint"" in just two days. He had never been to film school and had never been taught to use a camera. ""It wasn't meant to be for a festival,"" Duke told CNN. But his sister convinced him to submit his short to CWFF. The film's quirky silent scenes portraying, amongst others, two Londoners fighting over a pint of milk, amused festival goers and critics, and later the judges at the prestigious Cannes festival. ""When Cannes accepted my film, I suddenly got full access to the film festival, including the benefit of services such as free lawyers,"" says Duke. From there he obtained sponsorship for his next project -- a follow-up to ""Caution, Wet Paint,"" in which the same two Londoners get kidnapped by alien bottles of milk. ""London is a hub for film, especially in the short film category."" says Duke. ""And I could not have done it without the CWFF who were willing to accept something completely different."" Canary Wharf Film Festival director Olivia Bellas says she was motivated to start the festival as she wanted to show the creative side of Canary Wharf, an area that is famed for being London's banking hub. The annual festival, which takes place in the summer, has just celebrated its second anniversary and attracted films from as far afield as Australia and United States. Raindance Film Festival . The ultimate indie cinematographic happening, Raindance Film Festival started in 1993 and just hosted its 16th edition this October. Together with the British Independent Film Awards, the festival is brought to life each year by Raindance, an organization that offers support to independent filmmakers. Raindance Film Festival describes itself as ""too contemporary for most established stars,"" and cultivates a reputation for discovering new talent. Leonardo DiCaprio had his first screening at the festival, at the age of 14, with the iconic movie ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."" Raindance say part of the magic of their festival is: ""You can end up buying a stranger in the bar a drink only to realize they are the filmmaker of the film playing at the moment."" Rushes Soho Shorts Festival . Rushes Soho, a festival that takes place every summer for a week, is in its tenth consecutive festival year. A non-profit organization, Soho Rushes focuses on short films. The festival was created in 1999 when a group of friends, inspired by Tropfest in Australia, conceived the idea ""in a pub in Soho over a few pints of beer."" Famous names such as Dita von Teese and Michael Sheen, to name a few, have acted in movies shown at Rushes -- often for free. Past presenters have included actors Joseph Fiennes and Damian Lewis. Awards at the festival include best documentary, animation, music video, broadcast design and newcomer. Lesbian and Gay Film Festival . The Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, organized every year in March by the British Film Institute, has been in existence since 1977. It is the third largest film festival in the UK, touring in almost 40 different UK locations after London, showing to an audience of approximately 250,000 people each year. The festival was created to cater to the homosexual and transgender community, with most films addressing some of the issues faced by them. ""You won't get to see films like that anywhere else,"" says Claire O'Brien, BFI's spokeswoman, ""It is precisely for that reason that our festival focuses on films impacting the lesbian and gay community as they are otherwise not catered for."" Portobello Film Festival . The Portobello Film Festival was created in 1996 as a ""reaction to the moribund state of the British film industry, to provide a forum for new filmmakers and give exposure to movies on different formats."" Dubbed ""London's biggest filmic free-for-all,"" by the capital's listings bible, Time Out magazine, the event takes each August. Because the festival does not own its own cinema, it screens films in diverse venues like parks, theaters, clubs and bars. The festival's master classes give young filmmakers a chance to speak to movie insiders. In 2000, the festival expanded abroad, screening films at Cannes, Macau and Venice. Portobello festival is popular with celebrities such as Kelly Osborne and Courtney Love, who have attended the festival's screenings and premieres. Korean Film Festival . The Korean Film Festival will start its third edition on November 6 at London's arts hub, the Barbican. The opening night movie will be Kimchi Western, ""The Good, the Bad and the Weird,"" by director Kim Jee Woon, who will introduce the film. The festival runs over nine days and will then move on the Liverpool for three extra days of screenings. In addition to the new Korean films, the festival will also feature some Korean classics, such as ""The Aimless Bullet"" (1960).","Buzzing with film talent, London has almost a dozen festivals .

"(CNN) -- Actress Lucy Liu is an ambassador for UNICEF, an organization that gives children the essentials for a safe and healthy childhood. Approximately 21,000 children die every day from preventable causes, according to UNICEF, and its mission is to reduce that number to zero. Liu recently sat down with CNN's Sonya Hamasaki to talk about UNICEF's efforts to save lives around the world and what a hero means to her. Below are excerpts from that interview. Sonya Hamasaki: Why did you decide to get involved with UNICEF? Lucy Liu: I'd heard about UNICEF for a really long time. ... They are on the ground all the time for these children. It's so comforting to know that they have the ability to provide. When I go on these missions and I am there with the children in these villages, it is so heartbreaking. But it's so inspiring to know that people have dedicated their lives to being there for these kids. I just feel like there's so much more that needs to be done and that can be done, and I want to be part of that. Hamasaki: What's it been like working with children around the world? Liu: I think the one thing that I've taken away from all of the travels and all of the countries that I've been is that the children are always so warm and so inviting. Even though some of their parents may have passed away, there's always a wonderful sense of community that these kids have with one another and within the village that they live. It is about taking care of others and looking out for others. There's a sense of family, togetherness. These kids stick together through thick and thin, and that's something I think that's really exciting. Hamasaki: Education is important to you. What does UNICEF do to promote education? Liu: I think it's really heartbreaking to see children who want to have an education, who are hungry for that, but they're not able to receive that. And I think UNICEF has the ability to put together -- in very difficult situations -- a sense of normalcy. In Pakistan, when I went there after the earthquake, they set up these school-in-a-box tents. It's very simple, and you give children a feeling that there's regularity in their lives even though everything else is falling apart for them. It's easy for people to contribute also by saying, ""I can contribute $10 to buy salts to make the water clean,"" ""I can give $100 for school-in-a-box,"" which contains all the things that you need for school. It's just incredible to see how much it means to them and how much we can give them. Hamasaki: What is a hero to you? Liu: A hero to me is somebody who puts themselves last, who puts everything on the line for other people. I think that children can be heroes also. I have met young women and young men who have been abused, some young women who have been raped and who have been near death and have seen so much violence in their lives, but they don't give up. They go and work in the shelter and tell their stories and help other women who have the same problem. Young girls who have had unimaginable things happen to them. ... They still stand up, and they still walk with their head high. These people could have given up a long time ago, and they never did.","Actress Lucy Liu is a UNICEF ambassador who has met children around the world .

"(CNN) -- Eddie Canales' nonprofit, Gridiron Heroes, provides emotional and financial support to high school football players who've sustained life-changing spinal cord injuries. Canales' son Chris was paralyzed during a high school football game in 2001. But it was a year later when the two came up with the idea to help other kids and their families. Eddie and Chris were watching a high school football game from the stands when they saw another player suffer a spinal cord injury. They reached out to the injured player and his family, and within months, Gridiron Heroes was born. CNN asked Canales for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: Where you were when you got the call that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Eddie Canales: I was sitting at the dining room table, going over information about an event we hosted the weekend before. I was so excited! I was listening to the other details, thinking to myself, ""This is what Gridiron Heroes needs: creating awareness on a big picture."" CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to Gridiron Heroes? Canales: What a difference it could have to be able to help so many more high school football players all across the nation. ... I was just pumping my fist, saying to myself: ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" What a blessing. I had goose bumps going down my arms. I looked up and gave thanks to the Lord above. My eyes started to water, because I know my dad is looking down. And I said, ""Dad, you were right!"" One of the last things my dad did was to bring me grant-writing information, telling me that I might need some of this information because Gridiron Heroes was going to be big and this would go nationwide. He went into the hospital that same day and passed a week later. I know he is smiling down on me. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Canales: One of my goals has always been to create an educational fund for these guys, because some of them are getting of that age now where they want to go to school. The state requires you take a full (class schedule) to get funding; a lot of them can't do that. (We want to) get them back three semester hours, six semester hours -- whatever they think they can handle --and let them go back to school. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Canales: Gridiron Heroes is not about deterring anyone from playing football. The game and the injury is the bond all these young athletes have. (But) these kids need help, and the families need help. More attention should be given to what happens to the athlete after an injury has taken place. More attention should be given to the huge disparity in the level of support provided by the football community for those injured on a high school level compared to a collegiate or professional level. I am hoping that the football community can come together to make sure these young athletes are never forgotten. Read the full story on CNN Hero Eddie Canales: .

"(CNN) -- Amy Stokes is redefining ""family"" for South African children affected by HIV, AIDS and poverty. Since 2006, her organization, Infinite Family, has used the Internet to connect almost 500 teens with nearly 300 volunteer mentors from all over the world. Stokes started the program after witnessing how HIV and AIDS left many children without parents. CNN asked Stokes for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Amy Stokes: I was attending the Social Good Summit in New York, and I received the amazing news while I was standing in a stairwell at the 92nd Street Y. I am personally gratified and honored to be selected as a top 10 CNN Hero, and thrilled for our entire team. Mostly though, I am very thankful because being selected will benefit the larger cause: affecting the lives of adolescents across sub-Saharan Africa. We are very proud of the impact we've had. Being in the top 10 both recognizes this and encourages the entire effort. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to Infinite Family? Stokes: Since conceiving of Infinite Family, we have been developing, refining and proving that our model works. Volunteer video mentors around the world connect with hundreds of South African teens every week. Expanding those numbers to reach tens of thousands of teens across sub-Saharan Africa is our next goal. We are certain that (this) will help propel us to the growth we envision. ... Most people look at these big problems and think, ""It's so big, I can't do it, I can't get involved."" Having had the ability to have people say, ""Oh, gosh, you don't have to be a millionaire to try something new,"" is really powerful. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Stokes: We plan to use it to start two new computer labs and, at our existing four labs, connect children who are still waiting to have video mentors of their own. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Stokes: We all learn best from each other, which is why growing up in families and communities of caring adults is so important. More than 50 million children in sub-Saharan Africa do not have this opportunity. ... We're figuring out how many millions we can serve. I can't adopt all of those children, so I have to bring someone else into their lives in some way. ... Infinite Family mentees are highly resilient and hopeful young people. They see and speak every week with their adult mentors face-to-face via the Internet -- an adult who is there for them and imparts life lessons and discusses, challenges, teaches, encourages, befriends and loves them. We play a critical role in helping our youth learn and develop and one day to become contributing members of their schools, communities and countries. Read the full story on CNN Hero Amy Stokes: .

"(CNN) -- Their candles flickering in the warm Tennessee night, fans quietly stood vigil over Elvis Presley's grave early Tuesday to mark the 34th anniversary of the singer's death. ""Thank you so much for being here and continuing to honor the legacy of my father,"" said a message from Lisa Marie Presley that was read to fans at the gates of Graceland. ""Your ongoing love and support mean very much to me and my family."" Presley died at the Memphis, Tennessee, mansion on August 16, 1977, and is buried on the grounds. Fans began filing past his grave bearing candles Monday night. Graceland hosts a week of events leading up to the annual commemoration, featuring tribute concerts, appearances by contemporaries and onetime sidemen and fan parties. The ""King of Rock n' Roll"" was 42 when he was found dead in his bathroom at the mansion, which he bought after hitting it big 20 years earlier. While his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat, the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem. More than three decades later, he remains one of the top-selling acts in music. In 2010, Forbes magazine estimated his estate's annual take from music sales, a Las Vegas show, Graceland visits and licensing at $60 million.

"(CNN) -- After being stricken with cancer, Patrice Millet dedicated his life to helping children in his native Haiti. In 2007, he started a nonprofit youth soccer program called FONDAPS, which stands for Foundation Notre-Dame du PerpÃ©tuel Secours (Foundation of Our Lady of Perpetual Help). The program provides free equipment, coaching and food to hundreds of children from Haiti's poorest slums. Its aim is to teach the children to become responsible citizens. CNN asked Millet for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Patrice Millet: I was getting home -- coming from a visit to an orphanage in Petionville -- when I received the call. Wow! I was moved, very touched. I admit that I had difficulty believing it at the time. I am so happy for the foundation, so happy for the kids. I consider this as a blessing. I must also confess that I stress just a little thinking about all the things this implies: the media, the interviews, the photos. I am not used to all this press or all this attention around me, but if it is to help the children even better, I shall become used to it. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to FONDAPS? Millet: This recognition means a lot to us, here in Haiti and internationally. It helps to bring awareness about the conditions our underprivileged kids live in. I think more people realize there is a lot to do, but a lot can be done by any of us. I thank God who, probably through me, wanted to touch these children, to give them new opportunities and offer them a better future. This is taking (us to) a scale about which I did not even dare to dream. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Millet: We used to dream about a lot of improvements, more help we could bring to the kids or about helping even more kids; there are so many of them who need it. Some of our goals are to buy a field we would be able to use anytime we want; to have an academy where we can help even better the kids who are talented in soccer and would love to become professional players; to expand our program and have more girls; to have a school with art, painting, music, so when the kids finish the program they have something in their hand; and to have a real and solid structure with an adequate administration who will make sure that FONDAPS' work continues even if I am not here anymore. For sure, this money will help us to start making these dreams -- or some of them -- come true. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Millet: It is important to us that people understand that a lot of what they see, a lot of the results they can see on TV, are made mostly out of love. Some months, I don't even know how I will pay some of my coaches, because the financial donations I received this particular month were not enough. But still they will come, and still we will continue to support the kids, to listen to them and to play with them. This is FONDAPS, and this is what all organizations working with these underprivileged kids should be about: love. Love first, then comes the money. Read the full story on CNN Hero Patrice Millet: .

"(CNN) -- Taryn Davis is helping young military widows find the emotional support they need. Davis was just 21 years old when her husband, an Army corporal, was killed in Iraq. Four months after his death, she created the American Widow Project. The nonprofit has connected more than 900 young military widows through the Internet and weekend retreats since 2007. CNN asked Davis for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Taryn Davis: I was getting everything ready for an American Widow Project retreat in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Widows were arriving as I was on the phone. Words truly cannot describe what this means to me, my fellow widows, our husbands and all the healing and camaraderie that will come from this amazing platform and honor. The (Hero) title, though, should be Heroes, as it is a title that encompasses not only my life, love and dedication, but that of every widow that is a part of the American Widow Project and each of the heroes whose lives and legacies they carry on. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to the American Widow Project? Davis: This means that more widows will know they are not alone. It may seem like a simple statement, but more than 3,000 widows had their lives changed with two men at their door. After they get that news, the real struggles start. And that's where the American Widow Project comes in. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Davis: It will be an integral part in helping facilitate the daily running of the American Widow Project, but most importantly it will go toward our events for the widows throughout the country. We cover all costs for their time with us, so the only thing they need to worry about is healing and connecting with their fellow widows. With nine to 10 events held nationally throughout the year -- with hopes to do more -- these are a major aspect of the organization and connecting this generation's widows. This money will truly go toward not only saving lives, but the legacies of our nation's heroes. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Davis: The wounds from those affected by these conflicts, many can be seen with the naked eye. For this generation's military widows and widowers, their wounds can't be seen (even) though they are some of the most severe. It is due to that fact that most of those suffering from the most major of losses don't receive the support and compassion they so deeply deserve. The work the American Widow Project does recognizes their sacrifice, survival and perseverance and allows them to find healing in a title they never thought they'd hold.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Ramesh Makwana knew the risks to his health by working in an agate factory, but at $4 a day the rewards were too great. Now, after 14 years of breathing in the fine dust created by grinding and polishing the gemstone, Makwana has silicosis, a respiratory disease that swells the lungs. ""He's thankful to the stone because it helped him survive for so long. But now that he has lost so much, it is also a feeling of anger,"" Makwana told CNN through an interpreter, Mohit Gupta, the co-ordinator for the Occupational, Environmental Health Network of India. ""He has lost his parents to it, and he himself knows he's going to die some day,"" he said. It's not known how many other workers in Asia are suffering from occupational diseases, but the Asia Monitor Resource Center (AMRC) has warned that the region is facing an epidemic. The last estimate on work-related diseases in Asia was released by the International Labor Organization in 2008. It estimated that more than 1.1 million people in Asia were dying each year. ""One-point-one million is a really high number, but even then we're not sure, we think it may be a really conservative number,"" said Sanjiv Pandita, Executive Director of the AMRC. Frustrated by the lack of official records, Pandita and his team set out to find the true extent of the problem in six Asian countries: China, India, Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia. A report released ahead of this year's International Workers' Memorial Day on April 28, found similar problems in all countries; a lack of official data on the number of cases, partly due to a reluctance to diagnose work-related illness for fear of the financial cost. ""The problem is there is no data, absolutely no data. You can get quarterly data for economic statistics, but you can't get any data about the workers... what is their health, how are they faring? There is no data on that,"" Pandita said. The problem is not being recognized nor addressed, Pandita said, because governments and industry in the region are prioritizing economic growth over people. ""I think it's complete apathy from the government, from the industry and from all of us as a society. We're just too insensitive. We think it's OK for people to die producing things. I don't know. I cannot understand,"" he said. Wang Fengping fights back tears when asked how her life has changed since she suffered the effects of cadium poisoning after working 15 years in a battery factory in China. ""Before I found myself having the cadium poisoning I felt my life and work were quite happy. Although it was sometimes tiring, but I also found my job rewarding, I liked my job,"" she said in an interview with CNN. Wang was a relatively highly paid engineer in charge of maintaining the battery-making machines. ""After this poisoning and my kidney was badly destroyed so my body became very weak,"" she said, adding that she no longer works due to the effects of kidney failure. Wang said she has struggled to find a doctor in China willing to certify her illness as an occupational disease, a pre-condition of any claim for compensation. Pandita said in many cases employees have struggled to even prove they were employed. ""It's coming up as a major issue, especially in China. The first thing they have to do if somebody gets sick, they have to submit their work contract. And many times they don't have that. And employers refuse to give it. So it's a very complicated procedure they're made to go through,"" he said. In other cases, workers, especially migrants, are not covered by labor laws. When they get ill, they go home and for employers the problem disappears. A lack of regulation over the use of toxic materials is also exacerbating workplace illness, Pandita added. ""The problem in Asia we face is that industries still use a lot of hazardous materials and chemicals which may be banned elsewhere. Like asbestos. It's banned in almost 80 countries worldwide. We still use it in Asia,"" he said. Non-governmental organizations are working within countries to try to warn workers of the cost, and to encourage victims to unite to try to push for compensation. In Makwana's village of Shakarpur in the Khambat region of Gujarat, India, efforts are underway to educate workers at the agate factories, and to find them other, safer sources of income. ""The organization has been trying to rehabilitate people, find alternative employment for people, in arts and agriculture,"" Gupta said. ""But of course it doesn't pay as much as this work pays, but at least they'll still be alive for a long time.""","Asia Monitor Resource Center releases report warning of Asian worker 'epidemic'

"(CNN) -- The Senate Homeland Security Committee has scheduled a public hearing on the prostitution scandal involving U.S. military and Secret Service agents in Colombia. The hearing will take place May 23, Sen. Joe Lieberman, the committee chairman, told CNN's ""State of the Union."" Lieberman's is one of four congressional committees looking into the incident. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan and Acting Inspector General Charles Edwards will testify, Lieberman said. The committee will ask whether Sullivan is satisfied with the investigation into what occurred in Cartagena, Colombia, Lieberman said. Secondly, Lieberman said, the committee will ask, ""Were there indications before the Colombian scandal of behavior by Secret Service agents off duty on assignment that should have been a warning that this was coming?"" ""And third, what are you going to do, Director Sullivan, to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again."" Two weeks ago, the committee sent Sullivan a list of questions to answer by Monday. The incident, which transpired a month ago in advance of President Obama's trip to the Summit of the Americas, was ""heartbreaking"" and ""dangerous,"" said Lieberman, an Independent from Connecticut. It involved roughly 20 alleged prostitutes, and has so far resulted in the dismissal of nine Secret Service members. Three other Secret Service agents were cleared of serious misconduct. The military is investigating the alleged involvement of 12 service members. Photos: A decade with the Secret Service . Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has said there is no evidence the president's security was put at risk due to the incident. He noted that the president's schedule was not kept in the hotel rooms of any service members believed to be involved in the scandal. Sen. John McCain, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said no classified information or weapons were present at the Hotel Caribe, where the alleged incident occurred. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, announced Sunday that he declined a request from one of the Colombian prostitutes that he meet with her. An attorney for Dania Londono Suarez contacted the committee with the request, he said in a statement. ""While such a meeting -- and the inevitable circus atmosphere surrounding it -- would no doubt be of great interest to the media covering this story, a meeting with her is simply not necessary at this time for the committee to conduct a serious and thorough investigation. For now, I have directed my staff to communicate with and gather information about the misconduct from the woman via her attorney."" Secret Service investigators have interviewed her, King said.

"(CNN) -- Vito Maggiolo, an assignment editor in Washington who has been with CNN since the network started in 1980, was sent to Beijing in the spring of 1989 to help cover the historic visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to China -- like everyone else who was sent to Beijing. Vito Maggiolo (right) argued that a letter requiring CNN to stop broadcasting did not have the correct seal, or ""chop."" ""All of us went to China prepared for and expecting to cover what for us was a fairly routine, scheduled, structured event,"" said Maggiolo. ""Then we had this whole event in the square materialize and suddenly ... we found ourselves covering a mini-revolution."" Maggiolo missed the actual crackdown -- his visa had expired so he was pulled out a few days before June 4 -- but what he'll always be remembered for, he says, is his last-ditch role in the confrontation between CNN and the Chinese authorities that ended with the Chinese halting CNN's live transmission on the morning of May 20. Alec Miran, the special events producer for the Gorbachev visit, had been negotiating with the Chinese to try to stay on the air. The entire debate between Miran and the Chinese officials in CNN's control room, filmed by a CNN production person with a handycam, was broadcast live on the network. ""It was riveting television,"" Maggiolo said. Watch the debate between Marin and the Chinese officials in CNN's control room. » . ""Miran was telling them that we had a document that said we could transmit until such and such a time,"" Maggiolo recalls. ""He was saying that if that had changed, we needed a new document saying that. The Chinese officials then handwrote the notice on a yellow legal pad."" Then an ABC producer came in, Maggiolo recalls, and read and translated the document. ""He read this document and then there was this moment of silence,"" Maggiolo said. ""It was then that I chimed in. 'Excuse me, I said, but this doesn't have an official chop on it. China was extremely bureaucratic then. They lived and died by the chop. I was just trying to use their own bureaucracy against them to try and slow things down."" Maggiolo's so-called ""chop challenge"" brought another brief moment of silence before one of the Chinese officials said the document didn't need a chop because it had his signature on it.  Watch Maggiolo's ""chop challenge"" to the Chinese authorities » . ""It turned out to be a futile effort,"" says Maggiolo, ""but I gave it the old college try.""

Just a few days later, on June 4, Maggiolo was back in Washington at a D.C. firehouse, where he volunteered, shooting video for the fire and emergency service there. ""We were watching events on television,"" he said. ""My heart was just pounding. I knew we had people in the square."" ""I was anguished,"" Maggiolo said.

"(CNN) -- For Mike Chinoy, CNN's Beijing bureau chief at the time, one of the most significant moments in that heady spring of 1989 in China happened at 2:30 a.m. Beijing time on the morning of June 4, as the crackdown was taking place. Mike Chinoy: ""I described the gunfire and the bodies."" Chinoy was on the balcony at ""Tokyo base"" -- the network's nickname for its makeshift bureau at the Beijing Hotel down the avenue from Tiananmen Square -- watching soldiers march into the square with guns firing. He was also constantly on the phone with CNN Atlanta, giving the network live ""beeper"" updates on what was happening there. CNN's live video capability had long been pulled by the Chinese authorities. And CNN's first pictures from the square had already been confiscated. But Chinoy, a long-time China watcher in the midst of the biggest story he had ever covered, was keeping the network and its viewers updated by phone.  Watch Mike Chinoy reporting from Tiananmen Square » . ""The assault on Tiananmen Square was under way,"" Chinoy recalls. ""I could see a lot, but not everything. I was just describing what I was seeing, and passing on what colleagues were sending. I had a telephone line that could be kept open."" And then at 2:30 a.m., Ralph Begleiter, CNN's State Department correspondent at the time, started his talk show, which was featuring U.S. Secretary of State James Baker as its previously scheduled guest. Before Begleiter began interviewing Baker, though, he went to Chinoy in China for the latest on what was happening in Beijing.  See photos of the CNN team in Tiananmen Square in 1989 » .

The U.S. embassy hadn't submitted any reports. He hadn't had time to think it through."" It was in that moment that Chinoy realized that television news -- and the 24-hour news cycle CNN had pioneered -- was going to alter everything. ""It showed the way this live, real-time news on television was going to change the dynamics of how major players responded to dramatic events and crises,"" said Chinoy. ""It was a watershed in the information revolution."" No time for even a thought that June 4, 1989, was also his 37th birthday.

"(CNN) -- When Piers Morgan asked Kelsey Grammer whether he thought his ex-wife, Camille, married him because he was a TV icon, the actor said, ""no, I think she married me because I was Frasier."" The veteran actor is a guest on Monday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Grammer also told the CNN host that his ""parting gift"" to his third wife was her role in the reality series ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."" ""Whether or not it worked well for her doesn't matter,"" Grammer said. ""It was my way of saying, 'Look, you always wanted to be famous. Here you go.' "" Grammer told Morgan that while reality shows are not particularly a great way to become famous, ""you still get attention; you still get all those things that come along for the ride, which I think is what she was most interested in."" After three tumultuous marriages in as many decades, the actor says he has at last found happiness and true love with his fourth wife, Kayte, whom he met on a flight from Los Angeles to London. She was a flight attendant for Virgin Atlantic, and Grammer described spotting her at LAX. ""There was a warmth, a glow about her that I was drawn to. And I thought, 'Boy, I hope she's on my flight.' "" The pair arranged to meet up for a first date on Christmas in London. ""It was magnificent,"" Grammer said. ""There were lights everywhere."" When Morgan asked Grammer the secret to his long career in television -- particularly the long-running ""Frasier"" role -- the actor called it ""a characteristic that can help you survive in television, which is a kind of affability and vulnerability. You allow yourself to be human."" When Morgan pointed out that the ""odd thing"" about Grammer is that so few American television stars openly admit to being Republican, Grammer said, ""I'm a bit of a rebel. I don't tend to warm too well to people that tell me how I'm supposed to think. So, my life in Hollywood -- I'm afraid I was destined to be a Republican."" Grammer added that his Hollywood friends ""tolerate me somehow, because I can at least state myself eloquently."" ""The tone of political assessment has changed,"" continued Grammer. ""And honestly, the battle for the hearts and minds of the American people has taken on a bit more of a violent and narrow approach."" When Morgan asked Grammer whether he is sympathetic to the tea party, the actor answered, ""I'm sympathetic to some of the principles, but I'm not sure that the tea party has behavioral problems, other than the ones that can be identified by people who are inimical to them."" The actor pointed out that, like the tea party, he believes ""smaller government's a good idea. Always have. I think lower taxes are a good idea. Always have."" Grammer does, however, fully support gay marriage, which many tea partiers oppose. ""I guess I'm more libertarian in that way,"" Grammer said. ""I think marriage is up to two people that love each other, and if you find a church that you want to get married in, you go right ahead."" Grammer added that he doesn't believe the government should be involved in marriage. Morgan asked Grammer, despite his conservative leanings, what he thinks of President Obama. ""I think Barack Obama's election is a milestone for this country and a wonderful thing,"" Grammer said. ""The 'hope' thing, I don't think hope can be given by a politician or by a vote. I think that comes from God."" Grammer also pointed out that ""hope itself is not a policy. It never has been. There's no policy in hope. We can all hope. We can hope for free."" When Morgan asked Grammer why he thinks America is ""tanking economically,"" the actor answered, ""I would say greed. Greed that is at a profound level."" Grammer also stated that there isn't one Republican candidate that he's gravitating toward just yet, telling the CNN host that Republican contenders ""must inspire people to assume that they have a right to make their own decisions about what dreams they wish to dream.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- If 63-year-old Chinese scholar Zhou Duo had his way, he would be on hunger strike on June 4, sitting quietly through the day at Purple Bamboo Park, 20 minutes' taxi ride from Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Zhou Duo wants to mark the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown with a hunger strike. His aim: to mark the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown and to dramatize his defiant call for answers from Chinese authorities. ""What is the truth?"" he pressed rhetorically, as he discussed his plans with CNN a week earlier. ""How many people were in fact robbed of their lives? The truth remains unknown, because the Chinese government has suppressed information about the truth on June 4th."" On that day 20 years ago, Chinese troops in armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled toward Tiananmen Square. That was where Zhou, along with three other intellectuals, including Taiwanese singer-composer Hou Dejian, were on the second day of a hunger strike to show solidarity with student protesters. The soldiers, on strict orders to clear Tiananmen Square of demonstrators, had forced their way through the city's main thoroughfare. Along the way, they met fierce resistance from students and city residents who barricaded the streets, so they fired at them. When the firing stopped, hundreds if not thousands of people lay maimed or dead. A few hours past midnight on June 4, Zhou and the protesters on the square found themselves surrounded by troops and tanks, and yet several holdouts wanted to ""resist till death."" Sensing a sure bloodbath, Zhou and Hou appeased the hotheads and took control of their ranks. Gingerly, the two approached army officers and negotiated an agreement that allowed the demonstrators to withdraw peacefully. After they dispersed, some stayed home, some were arrested, and others became fugitives. Three days later, Zhou went into hiding after he learned that the computer company he worked for as a policy planner had become the target of a witch hunt. Weeks later, police caught the bespectacled sociologist. He was detained but was not formally charged or tried. He was released months later. Any regrets? ""None at all,"" Zhou said firmly. ""I would regret enormously if I hadn't done what I did and if hadn't saved the lives of so many people (on the square). This single reason is enough. Had I not done that, I would be hitting my head against the wall every day."" Despite the painful memories, Zhou said, he remains cautiously optimistic about how grassroots activism has grown in China. ""There is a huge difference now compared with 20 years ago,"" Zhou told CNN two weeks before the June 4 anniversary. ""I think the citizens are becoming more aware of their rights. It's especially shown in the ranks of the NGOs (nongovernment organizations), lawyers and intellectuals. This is an important sign that the citizens' consciousness has waken up in China."" Accordingly, Zhou has sought to abide by laws and regulations. A week before the June 4 anniversary, Zhou prepared to drive to a police station to apply for a permit to conduct his day-long hunger strike. He wrote an application, even detailing that he would simply sit quietly in the park, carrying a banner that would read: ""Publicize the truth of June 4 -- reach the goal of reconciliation of society!"" But Zhou did not even make it to the station. Police showed up at his home and talked him and his wife into going along with them for a ""vacation"" at a government-owned hostel. Reached by phone on June 3, Zhou's wife said good-naturedly: ""We are both fine. We are having a good time teaching the police about democracy."" She said they expected to return to the city a week later, after the June 4 anniversary jitters had subsided.","Zhou: ""Chinese government has suppressed information about the truth on June 4th""

"(CNN) -- Colombia's largest rebel group said it plans to release French journalist Romeo Langlois some two weeks after taking him ""as a prisoner of war."" Colombian rebels called for a committee composed of former Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba, a representative of newly elected French President Francois Hollande and the International Committee off the Red Cross to arrange for the journalist's transfer. Cordoba, a human rights activist, has been instrumental in many hostage releases involving the rebel group. She most recently spearheaded this year's release of the last 10 government hostages held by the guerrilla group. ICRC Spokesman Daniel Munoz said the group is ready facilitate the release. ""We hope (the rebels) will contact us again, this time to give us a date and time,"" Munoz said. ""We reiterate we are at their disposal with our boats, with our cars, with all our logistics, with all our delegates, anywhere in the country."" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said this month that his government would do whatever was necessary to guarantee Langlois' release. ""The Colombian government is willing to provide all the facilities so the release occurs as quickly as possible, but if you really want to be viewed well by the world, release him now and simply tell us where he is and we will go get him. "" Langlois, who works for France 24 and is a war reporter with more than 10 years experience in the country, was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group attacked, the Colombian government said. During the raid, a sergeant, two soldiers and a national police officer were killed, the Ministry of National Defense said; six others were injured. The Colombian government is expected to hold a hearing on the April 28 operation. Colombian defense minister Juan Carlos Pinzon, along with the Commandant of the Colombian Army Gen. Alejandro Navas are expected to take part.. Kidnapping government forces and civilians has been a key strategy of the rebel group. Dramatic rescues, escapes and hostage handovers have revealed harsh conditions in jungle camps, including stories of prisoners chained to trees, grueling marches between hideouts, torrential rain and blistering sun. While severely weakened in recent years, the rebels have continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. The 10 hostages released last month were members of the military and police that FARC said were its last government hostages. In February, FARC also said it would stop kidnapping civilians for money. The rebels did not address the fate of its civilian captives then, nor did it renounce kidnapping for political purposes.","Officials say Romeo Langlois has been missing since an April 28 rebel attack .

"(CNN) -- As Italy and other countries stare into the financial abyss, questions are being raised about whether the European Central Bank should be bailing out failing economies as the only institution with sufficient funds available to act on several fronts at once. But although the ECB may have the resources to help pull Italy and other cash-strapped eurozone nations back from the brink, bank president Mario Draghi says ECB intervention cannot be the answer. ""What makes you think becoming the lender of last resort for governments is actually the thing you need to keep the eurozone together?"" Draghi said at a press conference last week. What is the ECB's traditional role? The European Central Bank was established in 1998 after the Treaty of the European Union -- known as the Treaty of Maastricht -- created the structure for what would become the euro currency. The ECB's mandates are to control inflation and ensure some level of stability for the 17 countries that use the euro currency. Like other central banks, the ECB's main tool for attaining these goals is by raising or lowering interest rates -- a key tool for influencing financial markets. The ECB's primary remit is to control inflation around 2% or below. It also keeps money flowing through the eurozone's economy by lending cash (known as providing liquidity) to the sovereigns in return for holding collateral, or bonds, of those states. The bloc's financial structure allowed, however, each eurozone country to retain their own tax policies, budgets and banks and issue their own bonds. It is this lack of integration which is often pointed to as being a key contributing factor in the eurozone crisis -- not to mention a lack of fiscal responsibility by member countries, according to Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners. ""The ECB could've been shouting across the rooftops that too many euro members were not obeying the rules that were set in stone before the eurozone came into being in terms of deficit and debt,"" he said. How has that role changed during the crisis? While the ECB's power was initially limited to controlling interest rates, as the global financial crisis deepened European leaders authorized the bank to begin buying government debt in order to stabilize countries' bond yields -- the rate a country must pay to borrow money to pay its bills. If investors lose confidence that a country will pay back its debts, fewer investors will by the country's bonds, which in turn will drive the rate up. Greece, Ireland and Portugal were all forced to seek bailouts once their 10-year bond yield, or rate, surpassed and remained above the 7% mark for an extended period of time. Since August the ECB has bought billions of euros worth of Italian bonds in attempt to keep Italy well below this ""point of no return"" -- but on November 9 Italy's bond yield surged to a euro-era high of 7.3% amid fears that the eurozone's third largest economy could collapse. Some investors and economists see the ECB as the only European institution with the capacity to respond quickly to the crisis in Italy. Why doesn't the ECB want to continue buying Italian bonds? As international lenders desert Italy, the ECB is now in the uncomfortable position of being seen as a potential lender of last resort for nations that can no longer borrow from the private sector. The ECB is reluctant to do so, however, because the bank believes the practice would merely gloss over serious economic problems in eurozone countries and discourage them from enacting austerity measures in order to bring their debts under control. ""Once you've put that 'lender of last resort' thing out there, the perception will be (that cash-strapped countries will) be automatically bailed out,"" said Wheeldon. ""But financial stability can only occur if countries have discipline."" Experts say Italy needs to enact reforms that will boost economic growth, not just cut spending, to stabilize its debts -- and ECB leaders remain opposed to expanding the bank's balance sheet with risky sovereign debt. Still, other analysts say the ECB may quietly increase its purchases of Italian bonds if the government demonstrates a commitment to getting its fiscal house in order. What else can the ECB do? While buying bonds is currently an integral part of the strategy to keep Italy from collapse, experts say any successful approach must be more comprehensive if it is to work. ""Buying bonds can't be the total modus operandi"", said Wheeldon. ""The ECB will have to do a combination of things to (prevent Italian default)."" The ECB could lower interest rates in an attempt to encourage growth in eurozone countries, although some experts doubt a rate drop would make a much of a difference. European leaders could also pass legislation to allow the ECB to print billions of euros to pay off sovereign debt, but experts say that would only devalue the euro, cause inflation and undermine the bank's credibility. ""If that was the easy solution it would've been done,"" said Wheeldon. ""If the ECB printed money, the soundness of the bank would be seriously questioned."" CNN's Peter Wilkinson and CNNMoney's Ben Rooney contributed to this report.","ECB's primary mandate is to control inflation through interest rate changes .
ECB has been buying Italian bonds since August to try to keep yields low .
The bank has repeatedly said the bond-buying program is a temporary measure ."
"(CNN) -- The young stars of ""The Hunger Games"" may remember the blockbuster movie as the one that propelled their careers to the next level. But the biggest breakout star of the ""The Hunger Games"" may well turn out to be the state of North Carolina.

And its frenzied fans are already showing up at movie locations around the state to see where scenes were shot. ""People are obsessed with 'The Hunger Games,' "" says Marnee Revri, a Raleigh-based travel agent affiliated with Frosch Entertainment, who booked travel for the movie's cast and crew and blogged about it. ""I think there will be a bigger interest in people coming to visit, the same as the 'Twilight' movies. Kids are going to want to (see) where it was filmed."" Find Katniss Everdeen's hidden pond . Many scenes were filmed in the woods of DuPont State Forest, a 10,400-acre wilderness where waterfalls, lakes and fishing streams made ideal settings for the movie's outdoor scenes. Fans are likely to follow forest trails in search of character Katniss Everdeen's pond, the bottom of Triple Falls waterfall and the remnants of the fireball sequence.

Rated ""easy,"" the 2.6-mile waterfall hike has an elevation gain of 160 feet. (Triple Falls also stars in Michael Mann's movie ""The Last of the Mohicans."") It's true that the abandoned Henry River Mill Village, about 70 miles from Asheville in the small town of Hildebran, was home to the film's ""District 12"" Mellark family bakery and the Everdeens' shanty. But it's private property -- so just look as you're driving by -- and respect any ""No Trespassing"" signs. Party where the stars hung out . Parents of tweens and teens on this movie tour, take note. The movie's stars spent their after-work hours in Asheville, a town you'll enjoy independent of your child's movie obsession. With its funky architecture, independent spirit and thriving restaurant and brewing scene, artsy Asheville didn't need a movie to confirm its tourist appeal. Actors reportedly dined at the Laughing Seed CafÃ©, Lexington Avenue Brewery, Wasabi and the Southern Kitchen and Bar. They also stopped by Malaprop's Bookstore/CafÃ©, the local independent bookseller. Cast member Woody Harrelson enjoyed the 46-foot rock-climbing wall at the U.S. National Whitewater Center in Charlotte, which served as the capitol in the film.

"(CNN) -- The defense for Charles Taylor is expected to submit its counter-recommendation Thursday after prosecutors said the former Liberian president deserves an 80-year sentence for a war crimes conviction. Taylor was found guilty last month of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone's civil war. ""Should the trial chamber decide to impose a global sentence, 80 years' imprisonment would be appropriate,"" said Brenda Hollis, chief prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra Leone. In the statement last week, the prosecutor said the sentence reflects the gravity of the crimes. ""But for Charles Taylor's criminal conduct, thousands of people would not have had limbs amputated, would not have been raped, would not have been killed,"" Hollis said. ""The recommended sentence provides fair and adequate response to the outrage these crimes caused in victims, their families and relatives."" Last month's landmark ruling by the international tribunal was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II. Taylor, 64, was found guilty of all 11 counts of aiding and abetting rebel forces in a campaign of terror that involved murder, rape, sexual slavery, conscripting children younger than 15 and mining diamonds to pay for guns. Prosecutors accused Taylor of financing and giving orders to rebels in Sierra Leone's civil war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing. His support for the rebels fueled the bloody war, prosecutors said. Prosecutors, however, failed to prove that he had direct command over the rebels who committed the atrocities. There is no death penalty in international criminal law, and he would serve out any sentence in a British prison. Taylor has been a pivotal figure in Liberian politics for decades, and was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003. He fled to Nigeria, where border guards arrested him three years later as he was attempting to cross into Chad. His trial was at the special court for Sierra Leone in The Hague, Netherlands. U.N. officials and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. The court was moved from Sierra Leone, where emotions about the civil war still run high. Taylor becomes the first former head of state since Adm. Karl Doenitz, who became president of Germany briefly after Adolf Hitler's suicide, to be convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity by an international tribunal. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was tried by an international tribunal, but died before a judgment was issued.","The former Liberian president was convicted of war crimes .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Shock jock Howard Stern's addition as a judge on NBC's ""America's Got Talent"" could cost advertisers ""countless millions of dollars in customer goodwill,"" a parents group is warning. ""NBC's decision to add Mr. Stern to AGT will likely result in a sharp increase in explicit content, and we urge you to be mindful when considering a media buy,"" Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council, said in a letter to 91 companies that have previously bought time on the show. Stern, whose show is heard on Sirius XM Radio, was hired to replace CNN host Piers Morgan as a judge for the seventh season of the highly rated talent competition. The show, which returns to TV on May 14, is mostly broadcast live. NBC did not respond to multiples CNN requests for comment on the letter Monday morning. Stern's publicist pointed CNN to an online video of interviews of three unidentified women who attended a recent show taping. All three women said before the taping that they expect to Stern to be crude. They each praised his performance afterward. ""He wasn't that crude today,"" one woman said. ""He did make a 7-year-old cry; however, I think he did a great job and he was fair."" Another woman said she cried when Stern hugged that child to make him feel better. When Winter's group issued a statement in December calling Stern's hiring ""an act of desperation for a flailing network,"" Stern responded with a call to Morgan's CNN show. ""Networks shudder"" at criticisms from such groups, Stern said. ""They start to complain that I'm some sort of weird pervert who's going to convert Americans into zombie sex fiends, but I can assure you and the rest of America what I'm looking at here is to be a very good judge."" Stern said he will take his judging duties seriously with a goal ""to actually find someone who can become a major superstar."" The head of the Parents Television Council, which has a mission of ""protecting children against sex, violence and profanity in entertainment, was not persuaded. Winter asked potential sponsors to consider whether Stern's ""decades-long penchant for profanity, his affinity for degrading and sexualizing women, and his proclivity for vulgar and explicit dialog"" accurately reflect their corporate values. ""Stern's reputation for sleaze and misogyny is well known; and to our knowledge his only previous judging experience consisted of looking at insecure, naked young women and telling them whether or not they were hot enough to pose for Playboy,"" Winter wrote said. The letter quoted a radio broadcast in which Stern told a female guest: ""I would like to kiss you and chop off your feet. ... I wanna bite off your fingers. ... I wanna have sex with you and throw you in a ditch ... (and) chop your head off."" ""Does such commentary accurately reflect your corporate values?"" Winter asked. Advertisers must have a ""presumption that Mr. Stern will only continue to conduct himself in precisely the same manner as he has done for decades,"" the letter said. ""Unless and until his conduct consistently reflects and respects the time, place and manner of an 8 p.m. broadcast television program, we would urge you and your advertising agency to consider alternate network television programming for your media dollars,"" Winter said. While stopping short of declaring a boycott of the sponsors, Winter hinted it could happen. ""I assure you that every advertiser on 'America's Got Talent' will be held publicly accountable for underwriting any of the inevitably vile antics of Howard Stern,"" he said. ""America's Got Talent"" is one of the few prime time television shows that offer American families ""a brief respite from the otherwise-ubiquitous stream of violent, profane and sexually explicit content,"" he said.

""They want the world to understand them. They want the world to bear witness,"" Fouad Ajami, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, said Monday from the camp. ""They also see the camera as a way of holding onto the memory of this lost world, a world that is very achingly close."" The fighting has prompted thousands to flee Syria, setting up new lives in a number of makeshift camps in neighboring nations. The United Nations estimates at least 9,000 people have been killed over the past 14 months in Syria. President Bashar al-Assad's government blames the violence on ""armed terrorist gangs,"" while the opposition and many in the international community say it is the result of the regime's bloody crackdown on dissent. Not including arrests, opposition groups actually estimate the death toll is at more than 11,000 and growing. A month after 'cease-fire,' where does Syria stand? Two of those killed are sons of Abu Mohammed, who recalled from the camp in Turkey how they had been fatally shot by security forces while demonstrating in Syria about a year ago. Another son is missing, believed to be arrested and possibly killed without ever having never met his 7-month-old son. Mohammed cannot justify why Syrian security forces killed his sons and the children of so many others. But he knows why they spoke up, and why many are still fighting. ""We had young men that cried out and shouted, 'Freedom!', and they were killed for that?"" he asked rhetorically. ""We just want freedom. What's wrong with asking for freedom?"" Through a hole in a fence, past olive groves and across rolling farmland, that sense of freedom lives -- albeit tenuously. While the Syrian government exerts control over most of the country, there are exceptions. The police station of one town, for instance, was turned into makeshift barracks for fighters from the rebel Free Syrian Army. At a school, where al-Assad's government still pays the teachers' salaries and for textbooks, students in blue uniforms burst into chants slamming their president. Outside town, opposition fighters take up positions along roads. They take a 19-year-old prisoner who, they say, was headed to enlist in al-Assad's armed forces, sparing him only after he vows to join their fighting force instead. Even with this sense of ownership and fragile freedom, there is little sense here that the end is near. That's especially true back at the refugee camp in Turkey, where expectations are low that they will return home safely anytime soon. The cease-fire that was to take effect last month hasn't ended the violence. One Syrian activist, identified as Zaidoun, says the government is ""playing games"" even with the scores of unarmed U.N. monitors in the country. Zaidoun said the government decreases attacks wherever the monitors are, then fills the void after they leave by pounding communities with mortars and gunfire. Zaidoun says he has all but given up hope that people from outside Syria will intervene and stop his people's suffering. But he still has faith that the dreams of he and other opposition will be realized. ""It's OK. We know now that world is happy watching us being killed, and we will do it on our own,"" he said. ""Even if it takes 10 years, we are on the streets and we will not change, we will not retreat, and we will not give up.""","Hundreds of Syrians pack a camp in Turkey, one of several set up for refugees .

"(CNN) -- One of the men controversially pardoned earlier this year by Mississippi's outgoing governor could land back behind bars after being charged with driving drunk and causing an accident that killed an 18-year-old woman. A Pontotoc County, Mississippi, grand jury has charged Harry Bostick with drunken driving leading to a death, felony drunken driving and fleeing the scene of an accident where a death occurred, according to the indictment filed on Thursday and obtained Monday by CNN. The accident happened in October. If convicted, Bostick could be sentenced to at least 30 years in prison. His attorney did not respond immediately to a call on Monday for comment. After the charges were handed up, Bostick turned himself in and a judge set bail at $50,000, Paul Howell from the Pontotoc County prosecuting attorney's office said. The 56-year-old posted bond on Friday and was released, according to official online records. This isn't Bostick's first-run in with the law in Mississippi. He was convicted of felony drunken driving in March 2009, soon after having been convicted in July 2008 and November 2008 for drunken driving. The former Internal Revenue Service investigator was one of nearly 200 convicted criminals, including four murderers, whom Gov. Haley Barbour pardoned shortly before leaving office earlier this year. The pardons elicited an uproar, with Attorney General Jim Hood leading a charge to overturn them. But after legal challenges, they were upheld. Bostick was still going through a court-mandated drug rehab program when he applied for his pardon last summer. On September 30, the Mississippi Parole Board sent its review of Bostick's application to Barbour, recommending a full pardon in a 3-2 vote. A week later, on October 7, Bostick was driving under the influence again, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Charity Smith attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside Tupelo when Bostick's truck slammed into the side of her car, the patrol says. Smith was killed, and her older sister suffered serious injuries. Bostick was jailed for violating his probation from his previous DUI cases. In the grand jury indictment, Bostick is accused of ""willfully, unlawfully and feloniously"" driving while intoxicated; refusing to immediately stop or give his name, address or registration; and having ""negligently"" caused Smith's death. When he received the pardon in January, the convicted DUI felon still sat in an Oxford, Mississippi, jail cell, awaiting formal charges for the arrest tied to that case. Barbour had said that he wasn't aware of Bostick's October 2011 DUI arrest when he chose to pardon him. But e-mails obtained by CNN show that the governor's office did, in fact, know about it. Amanda Jones, the governor's chief counsel, and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann were told about the October car crash that killed Smith just days after it happened. Jones and Hosemann were even urged by a lawyer in the firm that represented Bostick not to issue the pardon, according to the e-mails. ""They knew it, and they didn't stop it,"" Smith's mother Linda Smith told CNN last month, after becoming overcome with emotion when she saw the e-mails. ""Why didn't they do something?"" It is not known whether anyone communicated this information to Barbour. His spokeswoman would not comment on the e-mails, citing an ongoing case on executive pardon power that is before the state Supreme Court. The full pardon granted by the governor, for the March 2009 conviction, gave Bostick back the rights that were taken away as a felon, such as voting. But his two other DUI convictions remain on his record, according to the state attorney's office in Lafayette County. That means that Bostick will avoid the possibility of a stiffer sentence if he's convicted on the charges tied to Smith's death, because it will be treated as his third DUI offense instead of his fourth. However, he could be back to where he was before the pardon: as a convicted felon, thus losing the rights that were restored to him. Asked Monday night about the new charges, Linda Smith said she doesn't want Bostick to get any more second chances. ""I hope no one gives him any more pardons,"" Charity's mother said. ""I pray for justice."" CNN's Rich Phillips and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: The mother of a crash victim says, ""I hope no one gives him any more pardons""

"(CNN) -- Former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was formally charged with electoral sabotage Saturday, days after she was detained as she tried to leave the country. CNN affiliate ABS CBN, citing national police, reported that the former president was booked from her hospital room at St. Luke's Medical Center in Taguig City, where she is under police guard. The Philippine Commission on Elections on Friday approved fraud charges against Arroyo and several other former officials. Arroyo is charged in connection with the alleged manipulation of results during 2007 Senate elections, according to the Philippines News Agency. She has denied any wrongdoing. Arroyo was stopped from leaving the country Tuesday as she was trying to board a plane at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport, hours after the country's Supreme Court overruled government-imposed restrictions on her travels. The Supreme Court again Friday rejected the government's travel ban, saying she was free to leave as long as she posted a bond and met other requirements, said Jose Midas Marquez, a court spokesman . Arroyo was reportedly boarding the flight to seek medical treatment abroad for her bone disease diagnosed earlier this year, following three unsuccessful spinal operations in the Philippines. She arrived at the airport in an ambulance and was transported to the departure gate in a wheelchair while wearing a neck brace. Arroyo's lawyer, Raul Lambino, said the former first couple was ""subjected to indignity and embarrassment at the airport,"" calling the government's defiance of the Supreme Court order ""abhorrent and in violation of the rights of the individual guaranteed by the (Philippine's) constitution and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights."" But presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda described the situation as ""all high drama,"" according to media reports. ""They (the Arroyos) want the public to sympathize with them,"" he added. He said that while the Arroyo couple would be treated with dignity, the government would be ""firm in our decision not to allow them to leave the country."" Arroyo's husband, Jose Miguel Arroyo, is also accused of corruption. The Supreme Court, which is mostly staffed by judges hired under Arroyo, defied current President Benigno Aquino's state mandate of investigating allegations of corruption during Arroyo's 2001-2010 presidential term.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A New Delhi court Tuesday granted bail to India's former telecom minister, who was at the center of one of the country's biggest corruption scandals. Last year, police arrested the former minister, Andhimuthu Raja, and more than a dozen other defendants as part of high-profile investigations into the suspected below-price sale of telecom licenses. There are 17 defendants, including Raja and three companies, in the case. The 13 other individual suspects are already out on bail. Raja's lawyer Ramesh Gupta told CNN that the court ordered his client be released on bail Tuesday . The alleged scam has rocked the country's coalition government and investor confidence in Asia's third-largest economy. Suspects are accused of participating in a scheme involving the underselling of cell phone licenses at the height of India's lucrative telecom boom. Police have also questioned several high-profile executives. The firm of business tycoon Anil Ambani is among three companies named in the charge sheet spelling out the accusations. Politicians, bureaucrats and corporate officials linked to the probe have denied any wrongdoing. According to a government audit, the treasury lost as much as $31 billion from the 2008 sale of the wireless spectrum. That audit report came on the heels of allegations of massive fraud in sports and real estate. In February last year, prime minister Manmohan Singh accepted opposition demands for a wider, cross-party investigation into the massive scandal.","Ex-telecom minister Andhimuthu Raja was jailed in 2011 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A third person was charged with murder Tuesday in the California death of a deployed Marine's wife, the San Diego County prosecutor's office said. Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino, 36, pleaded not guilty in court Tuesday, said Steve Walker, a spokesman for the district attorney's office. Brittany Killgore, 22, the wife of Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore, was last seen alive April 13, and authorities found her body on April 17 in a rural part of Riverside County. A San Diego County judge set Maraglino's bail at $3 million on Tuesday and scheduled a May 22 hearing on readiness and a preliminary hearing for May 30, Walker said. If convicted, Maraglino faces 25 years to life in prison, Walker said. Also charged with murder in Killgore's death is Marine Staff Sgt. Luis Ray Perez, 45, with whom Killgore was last seen alive, when she left her apartment wearing an evening dress on a date with Perez, who is based at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, police said. The remaining defendant is Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, also charged with murder. She was found at a Ramada motel near the San Diego airport last month after paramedics responded to a call for medical help. Lopez was briefly hospitalized with lacerations, and her relationship to Killgore hasn't been made clear by authorities. Perez and Lopez have also pleaded not guilty. Brittany Killgore had recently filed for divorce from her husband, who was serving with an artillery unit in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, investigators said. Cory Killgore was granted an emergency leave to return to the United States when he learned about his wife last month. ""My wife, Brittany, was beautiful beyond words and her murder has left me devastated. My duty to her memory is now to ensure her good reputation remains intact, and help law enforcement and prosecutors secure justice for the person or persons who took her away from me,"" Cory Killgore said in April.","Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino, 36, pleads not guilty to murder .

"(CNN) -- A former top Colombian official survived an assassination attempt Tuesday after a daylight bombing in the country's capital, authorities said. Fernando Londono, a former interior and justice minister, was among at least 39 people injured in the Bogota blast. He was being treated at a hospital, President Juan Manuel Santos said. ""I want to condemn this in the strongest terms,"" he said, adding that the motive for the attack was unknown. Londono's driver and his head of security were killed, Santos said. A chaotic scene unfolded as the blast hit a commercial neighborhood in a city where such attacks have become rare. All the windows on a bus were blown out, and blood was all over the area, witness German Diaz said. People panicked, he said. Some cried. Video showed shattered glass and scattered car parts covering the street as rescuers arrived. Security cameras at the Bogota intersection recorded a man crossing the street while cars were stopped at a red light, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. The man threw a package at the vehicle Londono was riding in, then sped away on a waiting motorcycle, the CNN affiliate said. Colombian authorities were offering a 500 million peso ($280,000) reward for information leading to the capture of those responsible for the attack, Santos said. Earlier Tuesday, police detected and deactivated a car bomb in central Bogota. Santos told reporters Tuesday evening that there was no evidence linking the two incidents. Mayor Gustavo Petro suggested the attack could have something to do with the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect on Tuesday. ""We think it is a plan aimed at trying to destabilize the city on the precise day when the free trade agreement begins,"" he told reporters. He urged the city's residents to remain calm and report anything suspicious to authorities. Londono served as minister of interior and justice from 2002 to 2004 during the administration of President Alvaro Uribe. He was known for being outspoken against leftist rebel groups, including the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Londono travels with a sizable security detail because of numerous threats against him. Rebels say they'll free French journalist . Even as Santos said authorities were still trying to determine who was behind the blast, one police official blamed the rebel group. ""Nobody else could have done it, and we have reasons to say what we are saying,"" Bogota Police Chief Luis Eduardo Martinez told reporters, according to Caracol. Analysts offered a similar assessment. ""It has all the hallmarks of a FARC operation,"" said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. The bombing comes as recent Colombian government operations and policies have caused significant setbacks for the rebel group, she said. ""This kind of attack in Bogota has become extremely rare, but nonetheless seems designed to drive home a political point, that the guerrillas retain this capacity for violence,"" Arnson said. Several bomb blasts occur every year in Bogota, but assassination attempts are uncommon, said Ben West, senior tactical analyst for Stratfor. The last one occurred in 2007, when a letter bomb was sent to the deputy education minister, he said. In the 1980s and 1990s, high-profile attacks targeting government officials were more common in Colombia, he said. ""I'd say for about the past 10 years, it's been much more quiet,"" West said. ""One attack doesn't make a trend. It could just be an outlier, but it is significant that it was an assassination attempt, not just a random bombing. ... It is a more sophisticated attack."" Local media reports have speculated that the attack could be connected with the trade agreement, he said, and some have suggested local criminal gangs could be behind it. But the FARC seems to have the strongest motive and capabilities to mount such an attack, West said. The rebels could be responding to a new government approach that expands the focus of military operations beyond the group's leaders, he said. ""They're going after all the FARC members. They're trying to be more disruptive rather than surgical. If they're successful in this, it's going to get a response from the FARC,"" West said. ""An attack like this, in Bogota, in the capital of the country, where the government is, it could be a response to the new strategy the government is taking."" Journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report from Bogota. Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.","Officials don't know who was behind the blast, President Juan Manuel Santos says .

"(CNN) -- U.N. observers who were stranded overnight in a Syrian town after their convoy struck an explosive device have made it safely to the city of Hama, the United Nations said Wednesday. The six observers were in Khan Sheikhoun, part of Idlib province, when they were attacked, said Ahmad Fawzi, spokesman for U.N.-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan. No U.N. personnel were injured in the explosion Tuesday, but three vehicles were damaged, Fawzi said. A bombardment by Syrian forces continues in Khan Sheikhoun, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The regime is using ""all kinds of heavy weapons, the LCC said. Opposition activists reported another day of widespread violence in many parts of the country that left at least 15 people dead. Nine people died Wednesday in Khan Sheikhoun, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A child and a civilian were among them. Four died of wounds suffered Tuesday as government forces attacked the area, the group said. Three people, including a young girl, were killed Wednesday when government forces shelled a camp for displaced residents, opposition activists said. The camp in Daraa is for displaced Syrians from the Golan Heights, who were not fleeing violence from the current unrest in Syria, according to the observatory. Syria, on state-run news agency SANA, said 11 ""army, law enforcement and civilian martyrs"" were buried Wednesday. Also, 250 citizens ""who were involved in the recent events and whose hands are clear of the Syrian blood were released on Wednesday,"" SANA said. Syria blames the violence in the country on ""armed terrorist groups."" SANA also reported that three terrorists -- one from Libya and two from Tunisia -- ""confessed that they infiltrated into Syria through the Turkish borders in order to carry out terrorist attacks in coordination with al Qaeda and militias of the so-called free army."" The rebel Free Syrian Army has been battling regime forces. Opposition groups say President Bashar al-Assad's government has been trying to mar their efforts with false accusations of links to terrorism. Syria has met their call for a new government and political reforms with a brutal, violent crackdown, opposition activists say. The LCC on Wednesday reported raids, the burning of homes, random arrests and more throughout the country. Ambulances were prevented from aiding the wounded in some places, the group said. The Tuesday attack on the U.N. convoy took place around the same time government forces fired on a nearby funeral procession, according to opposition activists. At least 23 people were killed and 100 were injured in that attack, said the opposition group Avaaz. The LCC described dozens of people falling to the ground after government forces fired on them using heavy machine guns. Videos posted on YouTube purported to show what happened. CNN cannot confirm their authenticity. The United Nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the 14-month crisis, while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000. CNN cannot independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the Syrian government has severely restricted access by international media. Meanwhile, a Western diplomat confirmed to CNN that according to a confidential U.N. draft report, Iran is violating a Security Council ban on weapons exports and that Syria is the top recipient for those arms. The report, which was drafted by a panel of experts and submitted to the Security Council's sanctions committee on Iran, describes three large seizures of Iranian weapons shipments within the year. The diplomat confirmed that report claims two of those seizures involved the Syrian Arab Republic.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India's cricket board have suspended five players accused of corruption following an undercover TV probe. The suspensions followed a TV channel's sting operation that purportedly showed the five players -- domestic first-class cricketers assigned to teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL) -- discussing money to deliberately bowl no-balls and spot-fix matches. Spot-fixing refers to players secretly agreeing to perform an act such as a no-ball at a certain time during a match. Bets will be made with bookmakers on the basis of this information. The players, T.P. Sudhindra, Amit Yadav, Shalabh Srivastav, Abhinav Bali and Mohnish Mishra, have been barred from playing cricket matches supervised by Indian authorities pending an inquiry, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said in a statement Tuesday. The BCCI appointed Ravi Sawani, the former head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption and security unit, to lead the investigation. Meanwhile, one of the suspended players threatened to sue the channel at the center of the allegations, India TV. ""This is a trap,"" Srivastav told the Times of India newspaper. ""Ask them to show the video clip in which I am demanding money or I am bowling no-balls. They have just put my photograph and played some telephone recordings which have been heavily edited,"" the paper quoted him as saying. However the BCCI action was backed by some. ""It was correct to suspend the players,"" said former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar in remarks published in the Times of India Wednesday. ""That's the least (the) BCCI could have done. You don't need players who are even contemplating doing things that they have allegedly done."" In a high profile case last year, three top Pakistani cricketers were jailed in Britain after being convicted of plotting to cheat by bowling no-balls and taking bribes in a match against England in 2010. Player convictions not the end of the corruption story . Former national team captain Salman Butt was sentenced to 30 months and bowler Mohammad Asif to one year in prison. Fellow bowler Mohammad Amir, a rising star in the sport at the age of 19, was given a six-month jail term. However, the epicenter of cricket betting is India, where hundreds of millions of dollars are bet on matches, according to Ehsan Mani, a former President of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Though match-fixing is rare, spot-fixing is very difficult to monitor, he said. ""The ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit is not able to access the betting odds being offered or monitor suspicious bets being placed. Unless betting is regulated in these countries it will remain very difficult to stop players being approached,"" he wrote in an opinion article for CNN last year.","TV sting purportedly shows five players discussing payments to bowl no-balls .

"(CNN) -- Four-time NFL MVP Peyton Manning is expected to announce today that he will be leaving the Indianapolis Colts, the only team he has played for in his 14-year career. Manning and Colts owner Jim Irsay are scheduled to appear at a noon ET press conference in Indianapolis to make the announcement. The two flew into Indy from South Florida together on Tuesday night, according to media reports. ""We'll see ya'll tomorrow. We're gonna talk tomorrow,"" Irsay told reporters after arriving in Indianapolis, ESPN.com reported. ""We're going to do this the right way. We'll talk to you guys tomorrow,"" Manning said, according to CNN affiliate WISH-TV. Wednesday morning, Irsay tweeted, ""It was a long, emotional flight ... now the sun is trying to rise."" The Colts will release Manning rather than pay him a $28 million bonus he is due on Thursday if he remains on the Indianapolis roster. Manning was the No. 1 pick in the 1998 NFL draft by the Colts. He became their starting quarterback that year and led them to 11 playoff berths, two conference championships and one Super Bowl victory. But Manning sustained a neck injury during the 2010 season and was forced to sit out the entire 2011 season after having surgery to fuse vertebrae in his neck. The Colts plummeted to a 2-14 record without Manning, which gained them the first pick in April's NFL draft. They are expected to take Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck or Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III with that pick. Both are considered franchise quarterbacks, like Manning was when the Colts took him No. 1 in 1998. Although he's expected to leave the only pro team he has played for, Manning's career is far from done. His doctors have cleared him to play and he's been working out at Duke University. He'll become a free agent and is expected to be sought after by several teams. Among the favorites to land the 35-year-old QB are the Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, Arizona Cardinals and Tennessee Titans. ESPN reports that Manning is expected to work out for select teams once he narrows his choices. Colts fans were sad to see their city's shining star on his way elsewhere. ""I'm disgusted. Manning is who Indianapolis is, he's our identity and what he's done for the community. He's more than a football player,"" Bob Nellish told CNN affiliate WTHR-TV. ""I wouldn't be nearly as big a fan without him,"" WTHR quoted fan Aly Wiggs as saying.","Colts to hold noon ET press conference .

"(CNN) -- Sadly, there's not enough of Knuckles, floppy ears and all, to go around -- particularly when the two people feuding over custody of the pug-beagle mix are separated by thousands of miles. Craig Dershowitz of New York recently turned to the Internet to pay for ongoing legal costs in his battle with ex-girlfriend Sarah Brega, now living in Southern California. He calls it a case of kidnapping, er, dognapping. ""All I want is to bring Knuckles back home to me,"" said Dershowitz in a video on a website he set up. ""He really is my son. I raised Knuckles since he was 2 months old."" Dershowitz said he has spent more than $30,000 in the court battle and is willing to go up to $60,000 in debt to get Knuckles back to the East Coast. He had raised $3,000 by late Tuesday afternoon. For $10, a donor can receive a virtual smooch from Knuckles. A T-shirt will cost you $25; a signed and numbered professional portrait is going for $200. In the video, Dershowitz wipes his eyes when describing Knuckles' tail-wagging and snores. ""In a lot of ways, he is like my son. He is absolutely the cutest dog in the entire universe,"" Dershowitz said. On his website, Dershowitz contends a court has awarded him custody but Brega continuously files ""frivolous"" motions in a bid to bankrupt him. Brega wouldn't throw her ex a bone in any interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""I think that it's about revenge on me,"" she said. ""Knuckles has been with me since he was 8 weeks old. I really can't imagine my life without him."" In a statement to HLN, CNN's sister network, Brega said Knuckles is ""incredibly healthy and happy here with me."" She said Dershowitz gave up his one-half ownership when he ""unconditionally gifted Knuckles to me."" The dog has not been in New York since October 2010 and Dershowitz waited until a year had gone by and was unsuccessful in reconciliation before filing suit, Brega argued. Her former four-year boyfriend, she said, has presented inconsistent facts to the media and in New York and California court documents. ""He wants revenge, and using an innocent dog is his way of harassing me and getting attention at the same time,"" Brega wrote.

"(CNN) -- Formula One's governing body has outlawed a technological development which would help teams improve the stability and aerodynamics of a car. The Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) took the decision to ban reactive ride-height systems for the 2012 season, with teams such as Ferrari, Mercedes, Williams and Lotus thought to be developing their own versions of the innovation. F1's official website reported on Monday that the FIA informed the 12 teams of its decision to ban the technology -- which helps stop the car dipping closer to the track under the pressure of braking -- last week. Lotus' system first came to light at November's young driver test event, with the FIA initially approving the technology as it did not involve the direct input of the driver. ""We have been investigating that type of system for a while,"" Williams' chief operations engineer Mark Gillan told the Flying Lap webcast. ""It obviously has an impact on the aero platform of the car. Anything that gets the front ride height lower is beneficial from an aerodynamic perspective."" Elsewhere, 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen drove an F1 car for the first time since 2009 at a private test event in Valencia, Spain on Monday. The Finn had his first taste of driving for the rebranded Lotus team, formerly Renault, in their 2010 car. Raikkonen won the drivers' championship with Ferrari five years ago, having also raced for the British marque McLaren and Switzerland-based Sauber. The 32-year-old raced in the World Rally Championship and NASCAR during his time away from F1. Raikkonen will take to the grid for the first time since the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November 2009 when the 2012 season begins in Australia on March 18.","FIA bans technology which improves aerodynamics of Formula One cars .

"(CNN) -- Expectations are high for Sebastian Vettel this year. And, as Formula One's youngest double world champion, you might expect some of that success to go to his head. But one of the men who knows him best, and whose job it is to channel the skills that have put Red Bull at the top of elite motorsport, is adamant that he is working with a ""grounded superstar."" Team principal Christian Horner is in no doubt that the 24-year-old German driver, who returned to the wheel in the third day of testing in Spain will continue to be a perfect role model. ""He is a great champion and a great ambassador for the sport,"" Horner told F1's official website. ""He connects to his age group in a fantastic way as he has all the 'features' of a modern-day hero. Can Senna restore the romance to Formula One?

The Red Bull Racing name is now established as F1's dominant force despite this year being just the Austrian-owned team's eighth in the sport. Horner is pleased with the rapid progress the Britain-based marque has made, and challenged the team to carry their championship-winning form into 2012. ""2011 was an incredible year for the team and it is amazing what we have achieved,"" he said. ""Defending both world titles obviously raises the bar again for 2012, and of course our goal and objective is to defend both trophies again. They look perfect on the shelf in our factory. ""Red Bull Racing hasn't been in F1 long, which means that we are competing with teams with some phenomenal history and a lot of knowledge to fall back on. So we are taking nothing for granted."" Horner anticipates a full-blooded battle for the drivers' and constructors' titles this season, which starts with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 18. British team McLaren boast world champions in Lewis Hamilton (2008) and Jenson Button, who triumphed the following year with Brawn GP and was runner-up last season. Legendary Italian marque Ferrari, who have won a record 16 constructors' titles, will be led by Spanish two-time world champion Fernando Alonso. ""We know that McLaren is always a strong team,"" Horner said. ""They have two great drivers so they definitely will be pushing very hard. ""Fernando Alonso and Ferrari will also be strong opponents. So yes, they will be the usual suspects.""","Red Bull team principal Christian Horner calls Sebastian Vettel a ""grounded superstar""

"(CNN) -- It's a South Korean car crash that has been viewed online 2 million times over the past week and has sparked a government-led investigation. A couple in their 60s were driving to a department store in Daegu, 238 kilometers (148 miles) south of Seoul, when their car suddenly accelerated. Their son, who wants to be identified only by his surname, Kwon, posted the video from May 6 onto an Internet forum, he says to prove his father was not at fault. Kwon told CNN, ""My father said he heard an odd noise from the car. He thought there was something wrong, then felt the vehicle suddenly accelerating. He twisted the car wheel to the left as he was trying to avoid the cars in front of him, and that is when the vehicle accelerated at a crazy speed. He continued to avoid traffic and people but in the end, there was nowhere else to dodge, and he crashed into a car."" The footage from a camera attached to the rearview mirror -- a common practice in South Korea -- shows that the car also drove through two red lights before it crashed into the stationary car at a speed believed to be 80 mph (129 kph). You can hear the couple saying, ""Oh my God, what is happening, what is wrong?"" The wife screams ""Oh no"" just before impact. Kwon says his mother, 63, had an operation for internal bleeding and is awaiting a second operation on her back. His father, 65, suffered a fractured finger and fractured ribs. The Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs says it is investigating the claim of sudden unintended acceleration. Sohn Young-sam, an official at the ministry, told CNN that 80 claims of such acceleration have been investigated since 2003. Hyundai declined a CNN interview request but sent a statement saying, ""The vehicle is being investigated by the Korean National Forensic Service. There is no time estimate for the conclusion of the investigation."" CNN's K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.","A car suddenly accelerated as a couple drove to a store .

"(CNN) -- When the Tunisian revolt erupted last year, Tunisia's president fled power in weeks. When Egyptians took to the streets, longtime leader Hosni Mubarak was swiftly ousted as well. In Libya, it took about seven months for rebels to topple dictator Moammar Gadhafi. And in Yemen, sustained anti-government protests eventually led to the departure from power of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. But Bashar al-Assad, the president of embattled Syria, is a survivor. He's remained ensconced in power despite an 11-month popular uprising, a bloody government crackdown against civilians, and world outrage at the tales and videos filtering out of Syria. Observers say he's been able to stay in power with a combination of regime ruthlessness, diplomatic subterfuge, and internal sectarian dynamics. Rafif Jouejati, spokeswoman for the Local Coordination Committees, the Syrian opposition group, said that when al-Assad came to power in 2000, he inherited a Soviet-style intelligence network erected by his father, Hafez Assad, who ruled from the early 1970s till his death in 2000. That spider web of agencies has served to control popular discontent, she said. ""He has a network within a network within a network of intelligence services."" Al-Assad has continued what she calls ""the family tradition."" The repression has generated the widespread fear ""embedded in day-to-day life"" among the populace. ""He didn't come up with this himself. This came from his father,"" she said. ""In Syria, there are dozens of Mukhabarat-types of agencies that spy on one another,"" she said, using an Arabic term for intelligence agencies. ""In families, one doesn't know if one's sibling is an informant."" Jouejati said Hafez Assad has able to strike a deal with business elites 30 years ago during popular tumult then. ""That's been an important factor"" and ""up until recently"" Bashar al-Assad has had the support of the business community. She compares the current president to Germany's Adolf Hitler and Cambodia's Pol Pot. And she likens regimes in Haiti and North Korea, where sons inherited power from their fathers, to al-Assad's Baathist regime. ""He's got a whole group around him, many of whom are from the old guard and they keep the pressure going,"" with ""Soviet-style tactics that other repressive regimes have used."" ""They are raising the level the violence,"" she said. She said al-Assad staked out his position ""at a time when the world is sort of getting smaller and everybody is more aware of human rights and individual rights and governments are pushing people for more transparency."" He missed a ""tremendous opportunity"" to work for that kind of change in his own country, she said. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he thinks al-Assad has been more brutal than Mubarak and Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. ""He's been willing to use live fire extensively,"" he said. ""He's just ruthless."" And in a reference to world and regional powers, Tabler said ""very simply we have not been ruthless with him."" There has long been sectarian strife in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, where there are Sunni-Shiite as well as Muslim-Christian animosities, among others. Syria's diverse sectarian dynamics buttress al-Assad, Tabler said. Al-Assad is part of an Alawite minority in Syria, a largely Sunni nation. That minority -- which he calls a heterodox offshoot of Shiite Islam -- prevails in the government and military. It and other Shiite offshoots, such as Druze and Ismailis, have made up the core of the regime. Christians represent another minority that has not largely been anti-regime and even some Sunnis have made their peace with the government. During the 11-month crisis, there has been a lot of international engagement with the regime. But Tabler said al-Assad has done ""a very good job of confusing diplomats."" ""That's his M.O.,"" he said. ""He consistently lies and confounds people."" But world opinion appears to be shifting, even those previously supportive of the regime. ""You can see statements by the Russians"" indicating al-Assad is neither a friend nor an ally. ""Everyone is frustrated with him,"" Tabler said. Still, Russia and China vetoed Saturday's U.N. Security Council resolution that would have backed an Arab League plan for Syria's president to step aside. Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, said al-Assad has been able to maintain some popular support with his rhetoric and has not been shy about using force over the years, even against people who were encouraged to open up and air their thoughts. ""He's convinced everyone he's been a reformer,"" he said. He is widely unpopular now in the Arab world, but many in the region have liked his stance against Israel. ""He's presented himself as one of the sort of key leaders of the axis of resistance,"" a reference to Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and Syria. Al-Assad has modernized the government apparatus -- the omnipresent Baathist rule and its ""deep state."" He and the regime have had a ""certain strength"" from different sectors of society, such as the business community. There are Sunnis who support his regime and al-Assad's wife, Asma, comes from a Sunni background. ""All of these things have helped the regime internally,"" he said. ""It's a mistake to just call it an Alawite regime."" Aram Nerguizian, visiting fellow, Burke chair in strategy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said al-Assad's support is dwindling, but he's been able to buy time for a number of reasons. First, the uprising didn't break out in the two top wealthy urban centers -- the capital, Damascus, and the city of Aleppo. While the unrest is closing in on those communities now, the opposition has been driven in the rural periphery of the country, far from the seats of political and economic power. There was no Syrian ""Tahrir Square,"" the place in Cairo where protesters gathered and that symbolized and catalyzed the Egyptian uprising. ""Assad has and still continues to benefit from the fact that a mainly rural uprising has to make its way into the urban strongholds of the regime. The uprising has had a hard time taking root in major city centers that fear a deeper destabilization of an already weakened Syrian economy,"" Nerguizian said. In addition, al-Assad's supporters are fearful of recrimination in a post-Assad era, and that gives them pause about backing the opposition, which appears to some as splintered and disorganized. ""The local opposition forces remain deeply divided and have yet to show true unity of purpose, command and control, and a socio-economic platform that the average Syrian can look to as a viable and stable alternative to the ruling Assad regime. This has become all the more challenging as the opposition has moved to arm itself in a bid to fight back against security apparatus' brutal crackdown,"" he said. ""The Syrian National Council in particular has had to work hard against perceptions that many of its members and leadership have been parachuted into their roles as an opposition force."" Communities at the margins of Syrian society, like Christians, Kurds and Ismailis may be unhappy, but prefer to stick with the devil they know -- al-Assad -- than risk the unknown of a post al-Assad era. ""Taken together, we have a broad pattern here. Most if not all of these groups are unhappy with how the Assad regime has managed Syria's nearly year-long unrest,"" he said. But ""these groups prefer that Assad remain in power rather bet on opposition forces that remain largely leaderless, divided and appear to be increasingly radicalized."" There is also a fear that change will bring instability. ""Many Syrians remain fearful of a Libya-style decay into militia warfare and lawlessness and are wary of the costs of uncertain transitions in Egypt, Yemen and Iraq. Outside of Syria, the opposition faces yet another challenge,"" he said. And, he said, the international community and the opposition ""seem to have fundamentally misjudged the resilience of the Syrian military. "" Divisions in the Arab League and at the United Nations have also helped al-Assad buy time, Nerguizian said. ""This division at the international level is tantamount to the kind of great power politics, balancing and bandwagoning that were the hallmark of the Cold War. This has and continues to buy valuable time and international legitimacy for the Assad regime,"" he said. Still, Jouejati said she thinks time is short al-Assad -- that the man doesn't have the same gravitas and proficiency of his father, who commanded the country till his death. ""Bashar does not have the skills and intelligence,"" she said. ""His father was extremely brutal but intelligent. This guy's an idiot.""","Syria's Bashar al-Assad's benefited from ""Soviet-style tactics,"" an activist says .

"Houston (CNN) -- After seeing Texas Gov. Rick Perry's lackluster performance in debates and accompanying drop in the polls, some pundits conclude it would take a force of nature to save his campaign. Fortunately for Perry, such a force does exist, and her name is Sarah Palin. A dose of Palin power would do much to revitalize Perry's chances to win the Republican presidential nomination. Of course, such a coveted endorsement comes with costs. Rock stars such as Palin don't just walk into campaign headquarters asking to lend a helping hand. Perry must be committed to a careful wooing process and to meeting most of her demands, however diva-esque they may be. So why should Perry grovel at Palin's feet in solicitation of unmitigated support? Because in the big picture, Palin power is just what the campaign doctor ordered. Just envision the image of these two politicians hitting the trails in Iowa and New Hampshire, flanked by journalists and flashing cameras at every juncture. This dynamism and attention would infuse Perry's campaign with a Hollywood cachet that his opponents lack. Or better yet, imagine a commercial with Palin touting Perry as a great American and a true, true Christian (hint hint). Palin's endorsement would give the Texan more street cred among tea party constituents, generate large crowds and fill his campaign coffers till overflowing. But more decisively, Palin's advocacy would do for Perry what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's endorsement of Mitt Romney does not, and that is excite a critical contingent of the Republican base: those pesky evangelicals who are just begging for an excuse to reject Romney. Perry's Texas charm coupled with Palin's rock-star status would get everyone talking about the Texan as a viable candidate again. With front-runner Herman Cain sidetracked by the recent revelation of sexual harassment allegations leveled at him while he ran the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s, the timing for a Perry-Palin alliance could not be better. But while it is easy to see how Perry could benefit from an infusion of Palin power, what does the Alaskan maverick with a penchant for self-promotion have to gain by pitching her potency toward Perry? With Palin's decision not to enter the race comes the threat of losing her voice. Supporting Perry would provide Palin with a plausible context to remain in the limelight, which translates into more photo ops, more speeches, more television interviews and more chances to flex her muscles. So both politicians have something to gain from joining forces. From Perry's vantage point, the Texan can win the nomination with her support. From Palin's perspective, her legend soars for saving a campaign on life support and, should Perry lose, she can save face by passionately proclaiming that she fought for the candidate and the values in which she believes. The country would also benefit from this strategic alliance because Palin's polarizing presence would force both Perry and Romney to reveal more precisely their conservative proclivities and commitments. Simply put, Palin power would push both candidates more to the right, producing a more informed voting public and a clearer contrast between President Barack Obama and the eventual Republican nominee. As Perry and Palin proceed toward the precipice of an uncertain future, each holds the solution to the other's most pressing problem: Palin provides Perry with resuscitation; Perry gives Palin relevance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shayne Lee.","Sarah Palin's endorsement could save Rick Perry's presidential campaign, Shayne Lee says .
It could also give Palin newfound relevance since she's not in the race herself, he says .

"(CNN) -- Confusion, fear, frustration -- emotions are running high among Greece's people as they face the prospect of new elections next month and massive uncertainty over the country's economic future. No party was able to form a coalition government after the vote earlier this month, and there is no guarantee that the elections set for June 17 will result in political stability either. Greeks set election date amid fears . Meanwhile, the idea that Greece might leave the euro, the single currency used by 17 nations, is gaining traction despite the latest vows of support from European leaders, and the Greek people continue to suffer under painful austerity measures. Alex Tsompanidis, a 20-year-old medical student from Athens, told CNN that the current crisis is affecting every aspect of life, even people's friendships. ""I can honestly say that the fragile political situation in Greece has scared almost everyone I know,"" he said. ""People have been considering withdrawing their bank deposits, if they haven't done this already. Most importantly, however, this recent political turmoil -- and the elections to follow -- has put a burden on everyone's interactions and everyday life,"" he said. ""People in Greece are now divided. I keep arguing with my friends concerning our voting preferences. Misinformation is rampant, and everyone is critical of everybody else."" Greek President Karolos Papoulias raised the specter of a run on banks Tuesday after the central bank reported that Greeks pulled about 800 million euros out of the banking system on Monday. ""There is, of course, no panic, but there is fear that could develop into panic,"" Papoulias said, describing what the central bank governor told him. English language newspaper Athens News said its reporters had been out to banks in the past two days and seen no signs that a ""rush"" was on. Journalist Thanasis Trompoukis, based in Athens, also rejected the idea that his fellow citizens are panicking, but he said many fear for the future. Woman 'sacrificed for a future that never came' Part of the problem is confusion over whether Greece really risks being kicked out of the euro zone if it does not abide by stringent European bailout terms because every politician gives a different answer, he said. ""We hear so many things and we don't know where the truth lies,"" Trompoukis said. ""Now we wait for new elections and, for sure, people think that neither PASOK nor New Democracy, the two major parties, can help the country. And we are sure that the measures that Europe asks us to take will not solve the problems for Greece (either)."" Those austerity measures include the tax increases and painful cuts to wages, services and pensions that have angered many voters and sent them flocking to back parties such as the leftist Syriza coalition, rather than the more moderate PASOK and New Democracy. The ensuing political deadlock is leading to fears that Greece will not have a government in place when it needs to make critical debt payments, which could in turn jeopardize its place in the euro zone. Business leaders prepare for 'Grexit' At the same time, its people ask how much hardship they can be expected to take. ""Here in Greece many people are really poor right now,"" said Trompoukis, pointing out that for many workers salaries have dropped by more than a third over the past year, but costs have not. ""They don't have the money to cover their basic needs, such as to buy food or pay for their utilities or their phones, and every day more and more (people) get in that situation. So if you don't have money to buy food, you're not worried about the European future of the country -- you are worried about your survival."" Greek media reports reflect the pain many people are feeling, as well as the sense that they are being unfairly asked to pay for a crisis not of their making. ""The country will once again test its endurance limits, as going back to the polls is unavoidable,"" the daily Kathimerini newspaper said Wednesday, as the date for a new election was announced. I Avgi, a daily left-leaning newspaper published in Athens, suggested the international community is trying to shock the Greek people into electing a government that will stick to the bailout deal despite the painful austerity measures attached. ""The bailout forces and troika create hell for 30 days in order 'to correct' the vote of the people,"" are the opening words of one its main stories. Turnout was much lower than usual in the May 6 election, said Marios Efthymiopoulos, president of the Thessaloniki-based think tank Strategy International, likely reflecting people's disillusionment with the system. He says his country is in urgent need of a stable, credible government to restore confidence and let investors know that Greece is ""open for business."" Greeks will consider themselves European whether they are in the euro zone or not, said Efthymiopoulos, a former visiting scholar at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. But most people do not want Greece to leave the euro zone, despite the huge debt it must carry to stay in the club. ""The problem is, how will you repay that debt? How will you emerge as a winner from that debt? That's not easy to do,"" Efthymiopoulos said. He also warns that if Greece were to quit the euro and return to a national currency, such as the drachma, the move would result in years of turmoil and cost money the nation does not have. Efthymiopoulos wants to see more young people in politics, bringing fresh ideas and a more outward-looking perspective. Reform of the country's laws and electoral system is also needed, he said, if long-term stability is to be achieved. In the meantime, no one will listen to the interim prime minister sworn in Wednesday, he warns, and Greece will continue to flounder until a government is convincingly elected that can win the trust of its own people and build alliances abroad. ""We have no allies whatsoever,"" he said. ""We are not credible and nobody trusts us -- and that is unfortunate because some of us are trustworthy, and now we need to prove that."" Melina Grigoriadou, whose job with an export firm means she often travels outside Greece, said she is frustrated by the unflattering views of her country she hears elsewhere. ""We are not a nation of lazy people or thieves or crooks,"" she said. ""As in all the countries around the world, there are people who work hard (for low wages), or people who beg for a job to feed their family, or people that fear about the unknown future."" The fault lies with the corrupt system presided over by PASOK and New Democracy for decades, Grigoriadou said, not the ordinary people who are suffering as a result of politicians' self-interest. ""Greeks didn't vote thinking of their EU future, but it was a vote of anger against our political system, our politicians who behaved to us all these years like we are their 'clients,'"" she said. Looking ahead to the elections on June 17, the mother of two says Greeks need to keep their country set on a European course. ""I can't say that I am optimistic for what is going to happen, but I know that to the extent that I can, I will try to influence those of my friends who voted angrily the previous time now to give (it) a second thought,"" she said. ""I am a European; I want to continue being in the EU. I want the euro currency, and I will vote now in new elections."" Tsompanidis, studying medicine at the University of Athens, says many people struggle to know what to make of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's comments on Greece, or the speeches of their own politicians. But, he said, ""two things are certain: Nobody wants Greece to exit the euro, and everyone can see that the financial situation in Greece has deteriorated rapidly with no light at the end of the tunnel."" Tsompanidis said he has taken part in some of the many anti-austerity protests that have filled the capital's streets in recent years. Many people's anger is fueled by the fact that the country's huge debt is a result of government overspending and corruption rather than private debt, he said. Meanwhile, those who do pay taxes, in a country where tax evasion is a big problem, have to shoulder even more of the burden. Like many students of his generation, Tsompanidis anticipates that after graduation he will have to leave Greece -- where more than half of those under age 25 were unemployed as of January, according to European Commission figures -- to seek work elsewhere. Journalist Trompoukis, 32, said four of his friends have left Greece to find work in recent months. ""If you asked me two years ago, I would never believe that so many young people would leave Greece and go to London or Germany or other European countries,"" he said. ""It's very sad."" Tsompanidis believes that while the tough austerity measures imposed on his country may have kept the banks and lenders afloat, it has not help restore investor confidence in Greece, ""instead plunging the country in internal bankruptcy and misery."" And he is also upset by the increasingly negative view of Greece that many overseas seem to hold. ""I am very distraught that the world believes Greeks are lazy and useless. I am very disappointed to watch everyone lose faith in Greece and mistake our inadequate political establishment with everyone else in this country,"" he said. ""We want our European 'partners' to help us restore growth and the prospects of the economy, but nobody is willing anymore, and that is a disheartening realization.""

"(CNN) -- Two U.S. Navy ships collided Wednesday off the coast of San Diego, according to Navy officials. No injuries have been reported and the cause of the accident is still under investigation, but it appears to be a steering malfunction, Navy spokesman Cmdr. Charlie Brown said. Both ships -- the USS Essex, an amphibious assault ship, and the USNS Yukon, a refueling ship -- were damaged, but the full extent was not immediately known, Brown said. According to a U.S. Navy statement, the accident occurred about 9:20 a.m. PT about 120 miles off the coast of Southern California. The ships were approaching each other as the Yukon was preparing to refuel the Essex, the Navy said. The steering malfunction was aboard the Essex, the Navy said. The Essex is scheduled to return to San Diego May 17 after completing 12 years as the Navy's only permanently forward-deployed amphibious assault ship in Sasebo, Japan.","No injuries reported as two Navy ships collide about 120 miles off the California coast .

"(CNN) -- At an early age, Marvin L. Winans and his nine siblings learned the music and the faith of their parents. A son of David ""Pop"" Winans Sr. and Delores ""Mom"" Winans, Marvin showed rare musical talent at age 4. By the time he was 18, Winans had preached his first sermon. At 53, the gospel singer and pastor served as the eulogist at Whitney Houston's funeral Saturday in Newark, New Jersey. The renowned pop singer died last weekend. While many of her fans lamented the fact that Houston's service was invitation-only, Winans thanked Houston's mother for having the service at the church. ""That took a lot of courage. And because of that you brought the world to church today,"" he said during his eulogy. Both Winans and Houston grew up in the church, with a love of gospel sown deeply in their hearts. Houston's mother, Cissy, is a Grammy Award-winning performer. Winans, pastor at Perfecting Church on Detroit's east side, officiated at Houston's 1992 marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown. After a tumultuous marriage, the pair divorced in 2007. The minister was asked this week about why some people question their faith when a woman with such talent and potential is taken. ""Salvation is constantly a choice. It is a constant vigil of doing the right thing,"" Winans told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""It is not a blame game on God that somehow God just took Whitney from us. It is a fact that we have choices and the choices that we make may not be the best choices, but just as a son or a daughter may disappoint their father doesn't mean that he doesn't love them."" Despite her well-documented problems, Houston had a simplicity that many who knew her still remember, Winans said. ""If you scratched the surface it didn't take you long to find out that she still was that little girl from New Jersey,"" he told CNN Detroit affiliate WDIV. The musical Winans family group hails from Detroit. Siblings include Benjamin ""BeBe"" Winans and Priscilla ""CeCe"" Winans, who have recorded together, and the late Ronald Winans. According to his bio on the Perfecting Church website, Marvin Winans has evangelized around the world. ""Wherever Pastor Winans ministers the word of God there are testimonies of healing, miracles, and lives being changed through the power of the Holy Ghost,"" it states. Winans told WDIV about the last time Houston performed at the Fox Theatre in Detroit. He joined her for ""I Go to the Rock."" ""It is that rock of salvation, that rock of faith that we have in Jesus that sustains us in times like this,"" he said. Winans told ""AC360"" that it is important for people to tell others how much they care for them. ""We take life and love for granted so often.""

"(CNN) -- A manhunt was under way Saturday in Greece for two suspects who tied up a guard, stormed the Archeological Museum of Olympia, smashed glass casings and stole dozens of small statues, state media reported. The robbers took 65 to 68 clay and brass statues, and a gold ring, police spokesman Athanassios Kokkalakis said Friday, the day of the theft. Closed-circuit video footage showed the suspects as they seized about 65 statuettes, Greece's official AMNA news agency reported. It's the second big theft of this kind in Greece this year. Culture Minister Pavlos Geroulanos submitted his resignation after the robbery, the prime minister's office said Friday. In January, three art works -- including a painting by Pablo Picasso and another by Piet Mondrian -- were stolen from the National Gallery in Athens. Dimitra Koutsoumba, president of the Greek Archaeologists' Association, said Friday that the latest attack was sad and worrying. ""It is the first time that we have an armed robbery at a museum during operating hours. It shows that the cuts the Culture Ministry has made since the crisis hit in 2009 make it easier for such incidents to take place,"" she said. ""The minister himself had told us that the cuts were ranging between 30% and 35%, and they include cuts in personnel."" She called for more importance to be placed on cultural heritage and said greater steps should be taken to protect irreplaceable items that belong to the nation. ""Such incidents are an issue of national security,"" she said. ""The artifacts that were taken were mainly figurines related to the Olympics, so many were depicting athletes."" The museum, built on an ancient site in the Peloponnese peninsula, is considered among the most important in Greece. The ceremony for the lighting of the Olympic flame for the 2012 London Olympics is scheduled to take place on May 10 at the Ancient Olympia site, where the museum is located. The first Olympic Games were held in Olympia in 776 B.C. to celebrate the deity Zeus. A sanctuary at the site was dedicated to him. CNN's Helena DeMoura contributed to this report.","Two suspects are sought in the smash-and-grab robbery .

"(CNN) -- Majid Shoukat Khan, a terror suspect who has been held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, pleaded guilty Wednesday to all charges as part of a deal that requires him to testify against other detainees. Khan, 32, is expected to spend up to 19 years behind bars in exchange for the agreement, according to Army Col. James Pohl, the presiding military commission judge. ""If I keep my side of the bargain, they'll keep their side of the bargain,"" Khan said during the proceeding Wednesday. He was charged with conspiracy, murder and attempted murder in violation of the law of war, providing material support for terrorism and spying. Pohl pronounced Khan guilty Wednesday and said the sentencing is expected to take place in four years. The defendant will be required to provide testimony against his fellow detainees during those years leading up to the sentencing. He'll then receive credit for time served, leaving up to 15 years on his sentence, Pohl said. In the deal, Khan -- who had faced the prospect of life in prison -- has agreed to be interviewed by government investigators without his own legal counsel present, provided that the government gives his attorney reasonable notice. He also agreed not to disclose information about his capture or the conditions surrounding how he and other detainees were treated. Khan, who attended high school in Baltimore, was held for more than three years at secret CIA prisons and ""subjected to an aggressive CIA detention and interrogation program notable for its elaborate planning and ruthless application of torture,"" his lawyers have said, according to court documents. Details of Khan's torture claims were redacted in the filing, but Khan's attorneys have said he suffers ""severe physical and psychological trauma from which he is unlikely ever to recover fully"" as a result of his ordeal. Asked earlier about Khan's claims, then CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told CNN, ""CIA's terrorist interrogation effort has always been small, carefully run, lawful and highly productive. Fewer than 100 hardened terrorists have gone through the program since it began in 2002, and of those, less than a third required any special methods of questioning. The United States does not conduct or condone torture."" As part of the agreement reached Wednesday, Khan is also no longer recommended to be housed at the island's facility's Camp 7, where high-value detainees have been kept. ""Majid was tortured prior to his arrival at Guantanamo Bay, but he made a decision despite that, and despite everything that's transpired in his life, he made a decision to accept responsibility for his actions and to really try to achieve some measure of redemption in his life,"" said J. Wells Dixon, one of Khan's civilian attorneys. ""The United States government should accept responsibility for what happened to him, just the way that he accepted responsibility today for his actions and the actions of his co-conspirators."" Another civilian defense attorney for Khan said her client has ""taken a leap of faith."" ""And he's taken a leap of faith that this process will work the way that we're all intending it to work,"" said Katya Jestin. But the overall agreement has prompted controversy over Khan's treatment and what information can be gleaned after years behind bars. ""Any plea deal and testimony by Majid Khan must be seen in the context of his years of secret, incommunicado detention and torture at the hands of the CIA, and the prospect of trial by an unfair military commissions system,"" said Zachary Katznelson, a senior lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who was at Guantanamo to observe the proceedings. The U.S. military said Khan traveled from Baltimore to Karachi, Pakistan, in 2002 to help al Qaeda plan attacks in the United States and elsewhere. The military said Khan conspired with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the September 11 terrorist attacks, to blow up underground storage tanks in the United States. The government said Khan had also recorded a ""martyr video"" and donned an explosive vest and waited in a mosque where then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was expected. The plan failed when Musharraf did not show up. He also was accused of giving $50,000 in al Qaeda funds to a Southeast Asia-based al Qaeda affiliate, which then gave the money to Jemaah Islamiyah to fund the August 2003 bombing of the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. That incident killed 11 people and wounded at least 181 others.

"(CNN) -- It's been a bad year for bad guys. Twelve months ago, no one could have guessed that Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, North Korea's Kim Jong Il and al Qaeda's Osama bin Laden would be dead; Egypt's former president Hosni Mubarak and Tunisia's former president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali prosecuted and former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic in jail. Further, Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh and Syria's president Bashar al-Assad are under intense pressure both internationally and within their own countries. Top aide: Gadhafi's 'suicidal' flight to birthplace . The Arab Spring, that led to the fall of so many of the region's leaders, sent shockwaves around the world, leaving major powers struggling to make sense of the changing landscape -- and ensure their interests are preserved. The dramatic events, followed by unrest in societies considered ""dormant"" in terms of traditional activism -- including Spain and Russia -- leave one curious to discover the ""common denominator."" The obvious but unexpected answer is: People power, in all of these cases carried largely by non-partisan youth movements. Much has been written on the revolutions driven by people power youth movements in Tunisia and Egypt. Their unity, planning and nonviolent discipline has inspired the world and given more than 100 million people a chance to change from dictatorship to democracy. The revolutions inspired similar movements. Now leaders of Morocco, Jordan, and even Myanmar are promising reforms. The government of Algeria has emerged from its state of emergency after 19 years. Syrians have risked, and sacrificed, their lives in peaceful demonstrations for freedom and democracy. Let me also note my own country -- Serbia. People power and nonviolent struggle driven by OTPOR, the resistance movement, brought an end to the rule of Slobodan Milosevic on October 5, 2000. OTPOR -- which grew from 11 founders to 70,000 supporters over its two-year struggle -- is credited for stripping away the fear and passivity that keep a dictator's subjects under oppression. During the presidential campaign of September 2000, OTPOR launched its ""gotov je"" (he's finished) and the ""vreme je"" (it's time) campaigns, which galvanized national discontent with Milosevic and eventually resulted in his defeat. OTPOR became one of the defining symbols of the anti-Milosevic struggle and his subsequent overthrow. Milosevic was delivered to Hague in 2001, followed by former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, then Mladic. This has enabled Serbia to lift the burdens from the past and push towards European Union membership. Srebrenica: Worst European atrocity since WWII . People power has been a phenomenon throughout history. It is credited with successes including India's independence movement, led by Mahatma Gandhi, the battles against racism led by Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela, and the agitations of Polish activist Lech Walesa during the early stages of the Soviet Union's downfall. Policymakers often overlook the strategic value of supporting non-violent movements. Fifty out of 67 transitions from dictatorships to democracies in the last 35 years came from non-violent struggle. Armed intervention was not the driving force. The new book ""Why Civil Resistance Works: The strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict,"" written by Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan, studies 323 violent and non-violent campaigns from 1900 to 2006. It finds nonviolent campaigns are more than twice as likely to succeed as violent campaigns. They also found non-violent uprisings are 10 times more likely to end in stable and durable democracies. The last year taught us an important lesson: What used to be called ""realpolitik"" is not actually ""real"" any more. There is a force more powerful at work shaping the new reality: Strategic nonviolent struggle. Consider what would happen if 1% of the billions of dollars spent on foreign military interventions in Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq and, more recently, Libya, went to nonviolent pro-democracy movements. This could be done through education, the translation of books, movies and video clips, developing innovative uses for new media like Facebook or Twitter, and training in nonviolent, civic mobilization. Rebuilding the ruins of Gadhafi . My organization, CANVAS, has worked with activists from more than 40 different countries -- and we have seen the power of such education at work in places including Georgia, Ukraine, the Maldives, Tunisia, Egypt and Myanmar. Brave, young and oppressed people around the world are realizing there is immense power in nonviolent struggle. I know this, because they are calling me every day for help. We must recognize the power of nonviolent struggle in promoting what some call the ""fourth wave of democratization."" We should commit these kinds of resources to show we have learnt the most important lesson from these revolutionary months. That would mark 2011 as more than the ""worst year for bad guys,"" but encourage and remind millions of oppressed in places like North Korea, Myanmar, Zimbabwe and Iran that power ultimately belongs to the people.

"(CNN) -- Loyda Rodriguez says she can still remember the day her daughter was taken. What began as a simple walk home from a shopping trip more than five years ago became a nightmare, she says. ""November 3, 2006, is when they stole my daughter,"" she told CNN Thursday. ""I had left to go shopping. When I came back, I did not realize that a woman was following me. When I entered my house, my daughter stayed on the patio, and that was when she was taken."" But that account is not what she has told other news organizations in describing what happened that day. In 2008, she told ABC News a woman appeared in her backyard and grabbed her out of her arms, while she was trying to enter her house. Last year, the Associated Press reported that Rodriguez felt someone tug at her daughter as she tried to enter her home, and then turned to see a woman get into a waiting taxi, along with her young daughter. And the El Periodico newspaper reported that Rodriguez said she left her daughter on the patio with other children while she went to deal with clothes on the terrace. Reached Friday by phone, Rodriguez told CNN she does not remember telling ABC or anyone that the girl was snatched from her arms. She said she's given multiple interviews on the case, and stood by what she said earlier -- that she left the girl outside after returning from a shopping trip. It all happened in about two minutes, Rodriguez said. Now, the 7-year-old girl is at the center of an international custody dispute. She is a child with two identities, in two countries, with two sets of parents who claim her as their own. In Missouri, they call her Karen. In Guatemala, she is known as Anyeli. Guatemalan authorities say Anyeli was snatched from Rodriguez and sold to an international adoption agency. Last year, a Guatemalan judge ruled that the girl belonged with Rodriguez and not with her adoptive U.S. parents. The Guatemalan government suspended adoptions in 2007 after authorities found multiple cases of falsified birth certificates and paperwork, as well as alleged thefts of babies. This week, the U.S. State Department weighed in on the case of the 7-year-old girl, saying a U.S. state court would have to decide whether the girl should return to Guatemala, because when the incident happened, the two countries had not yet signed an international treaty dealing with abducted children. ""Our view remains that, at the time, this appeared to be a legitimate adoption. So again, our preferred course of action would be for any claims to be pursued in the state courts of the United States,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. Rodriguez told CNN she was devastated by the news. ""I feel very sad, and I am still suffering, because I had hope that the United States would respond to me and would return my daughter. ... I do not know why they are unfair, because I have my rights, because I am her real mother,"" she said. In Guatemala at least 10 people have been charged with human trafficking in connection with the case of this adoptive girl. So far, two of those people have been convicted, and the others are awaiting trial. That's more than enough proof, Rodriguez says, that her daughter should come home. ""There is very important evidence, which revealed that she was stolen from me, and DNA evidence proves that I am her real mother,"" she told CNN. However, a source with knowledge of the case told CNN that while Rodriguez's DNA matches the DNA of a child brought to the embassy in Guatemala, there is no evidence the child in question in the United States is the same child tested at the embassy. Also, questions have been raised about whether the person presenting the child at the embassy was, in fact, Rodriguez's sister, which casts doubt on the kidnapping story, the source said. Guatemalan authorities say the adoption agency falsified documents to make the girl eligible for adoption, something that the adoptive parents in Missouri apparently didn't know. Rodriguez says she now hopes to go to court in Missouri to get her daughter back. The adoptive parents were unavailable for comment, referring CNN to their lawyer in Washington, who declined to comment. Last year a family representative said the adoptive parents would ""continue to advocate for the safety and best interests of their legally adopted child. They remain committed to protecting their daughter from additional traumas as they pursue the truth of her past through appropriate legal channels.""","The mother has given various accounts of how the child disappeared .

"Paris (CNN) -- We're at a soup kitchen in a shabby back street in Paris, next to the canal Saint Martin, near the JaurÃ¨s metro stop. Hundreds of homeless people are queuing up for some hot food and a coffee. Most of them are from Asia; many from Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Among them are dozens of children, their grimy faces, vacant stares and worn clothes redolent of months on the road. Some have walked hundreds of miles to escape the violence of Afghanistan. They have been told to get to JaurÃ¨s metro in Paris and they will be looked after. Often the people-traffickers dump them here, feeling they have fulfilled their part of the bargain: to get them to the West. We talked to two 14-year-olds who don't want to go on camera. They had arrived that day from Italy, after traveling through Iran, Turkey and Greece. The story they told us is typical: Their families paid thousands of dollars to send them to the west in the hands of smugglers. The journey was extremely perilous. They traveled in the backs of trucks, cars and at times walking across mountain ranges; it took them nine months to get to Paris. Like many of the children we spoke to, they risked frostbite during their dangerous traversing of mountains in Iran and Turkey. They claimed Iranian border guards shot at them as they crossed the frontier. But despite of the risks they kept going -- lured by the promises of lucrative jobs in France. The reality when they arrive is very different. Most of them are aged between 14 and 18 years old. Theoretically the French state has a duty of care for unaccompanied minors, but these teenagers must prove their age. Often they don't have the documents necessary to show their age, and so they are left to sleep on the streets. One charity, France Terre d'Asile (France: Haven) is trying to help, but it is hopelessly overwhelmed. The group estimates that some 6,000 foreign children arrive illegally in France each year -- most turn up in Paris expecting to be able to work to send money home to their families. That is, of course, illegal, so there are faced with entering the black market or surviving on handouts. The lucky ones may get a place in a reception center run by a charity. We filmed at one hostel which has just 25 beds. When we were there, 45 children turned up needing somewhere to sleep. It was cold and raining and only the youngest were admitted. The rest were forced to once again sleep on the streets. Mohammed is typical: He spent three months sleeping in a park before finally getting a hotel room provided by the French state, once he was able to prove he was 16 years old. He was lucky: his sister was able to fax a copy of his birth certificate. But many of his friends are still sleeping outside, because they can't prove their age. He tells me about the frequent fights between different ethnics groups -- Tajiks beaten by Hazaras, Pashtuns clashing with Bangladeshis. Muggings, drug abuse and the ever present sex-trade were all daily risks for him. His story is a microcosm of the problems that have consumed Afghanistan for three decades: He was orphaned by war and disease -- his father was killed by the Taliban, his mother died of tuberculosis. His uncle physically abused him for years until finally his brother-in-law agreed to lend him $6,000 so he could buy his passage to the west, but on arriving in Paris, his dreams of a job and a new life were quickly shattered. Now he has begun to make a start on improving his life, learning French, and getting his first taste of the internet. His prospects remain bleak, but at least he has a bed to sleep in each night -- unlike so many of the other Afghan children who are surviving on the streets of Paris.","Afghan families pay thousands of dollars to send youngsters to the West .

"(CNN) -- Protesters in Bahrain marched through the streets Friday to criticize government plans to boost cooperation between the island state and Saudi Arabia. The proposed unity plans have heightened already tense relations between Manama and Riyadh, on one side, and Tehran on the other. Though specifics of the proposals are not clear, Bahraini opposition groups are against them because they fear the plans are the latest in a string of attempts to crush dissent. Demonstrations in Bahrain failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a government crackdown, backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Bahrain and other Sunni-ruled countries in the region have accused Shiite-led Iran of meddling in the country's internal affairs and standing behind the protests, which are ongoing. Tehran has denied involvement. Bahrain is a predominantly Shiite country, ruled by a Sunni royal family. Bahrain's state news agency BNA reported the government will take legal action against protesters ""who committed violations"" during Friday's rally, organized in part by Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main Shiite opposition party. It was not clear what laws were broken. The same party was denied permission to rally Saturday outside a U.N. building, BNA reported. Hours before the march, Ayatollah Sheikh Qassim criticized the push for unity during his Friday prayer sermon in Duraz village, north of Manama. ""It is clear that the proposed unity is not one meant to unify the people of the region,"" he said. ""The people are not a herd of sheep, nor are they children or dimwitted to give up their freedoms."" Such unity is meant to strengthen the grip of the totalitarian governments and limit liberties, he added. The small island kingdom in the Persian Gulf plays a key strategic role in the Middle East and is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. Elsewhere in the region, the Arabic-language Al-Alam television network aired video of protests in Tehran, where protesters expressed solidarity with the demonstrations in Bahrain and denounced the unity plans as a ""U.S.-Saudi conspiracy."" The station claimed similar protests took place throughout Iran. CNN could not confirm the report. Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council met in Saudi Arabia this week for a meeting to discuss transforming their six nations into a union similar to the European Union. The idea of integrating the GCC nations into one entity -- and replacing what exists now as simply a cooperative -- was first floated by Saudi Arabia in December. The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.","Protesters see the proposals as a bid to crush dissent .

"Athens (CNN) -- Greece handed over the Olympic flame to Britain in an elaborate ceremony Thursday, 71 days before the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games. Following a display by performers representing the high priestesses of ancient Greece, the torch was accepted by Princess Anne, the British Olympic Association president. Crowds gathered despite rainy weather to watch the handover in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens. It was attended by soccer player David Beckham and London's recently re-elected mayor, Boris Johnson, as well as five young Britons picked for their commitment to sport. The flame, which has already made a weeklong journey around Greece after being lit at ancient Olympia, birthplace of the Games, will be carried back to the UK by the British delegation on Friday. The 70-day torch relay around Britain starts Saturday in the far southwest of England, in Land's End, Cornwall. Along its route, which will take in in towns, villages and cities across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland before reaching London, the torch will pass within 10 miles of 95% of the UK population. Sebastian Coe, the British Olympian who heads the London 2012 organizing group, said many of the 8,000 torch bearers had inspirational personal stories to share. The torch relay also will tell the story of a ""modern and confident United Kingdom,"" he said, ahead of Games that he hopes will unite the world in challenging times. The handover in Athens comes against the backdrop of political and economic turmoil roiling Greece. A temporary Greek government took office Thursday as the country wrestles with a political crisis that sprang from the country's inability to pay its debts. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","The Olympic flame was handed to Britain's Princess Anne in Athens .

"(CNN) -- Three shipwrecked fishermen lived on clams and seaweed for 10 days while stranded on an island off Canada's Pacific Coast until a passing sailboat rescued them, the Royal Canadian Navy said Friday. On Friday, the Canadian Coast Guard ship Tanu rendezvoused with the sailboat and was transporting the three fishermen northbound back to Prince Rupert, according to the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Victoria. The three fishermen were scheduled to arrive Friday night, and no injuries have been reported, authorities said. The three men were on a fishing trip on their 50-foot liner Pacific Siren when it capsized about 70 miles south of Prince Rupert, the navy said. The three men boarded a life raft and paddled eight miles to Banks Island, located off central British Columbia in the Hecate Strait, a fishing ground for salmon and halibut, the navy said. While on the island, they used their raft as a shelter, the navy said. Mackenzie Moseley, maritime coordinator for Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Victoria, described Banks Island as ""real remote piece of coast with no real population."" ""So, to see three guys on beach is really odd in itself,"" Moseley told CNN. A passing sailor in his 70s in his boat, the Macona, was believed to be on a pleasure outing when he saw the stranded three fishermen, Moseley said. The sailor radioed the Prince Rupert Coast Guard and then he anchored and launched a dinghy to approach the island shore, Moseley said. The sailor gave the three men food and water and then called the coast guard again, Moseley said. The coast guard's Tanu was on patrol an hour away when the call came in, Moseley said. Said Moseley: ""Real kudos to the sailing vessel Macona for keeping a sharp lookout and saw what was going on and did a good job."" The three fishermen's vessel didn't have an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, which transmits a distress signal anywhere in the world through a satellite system, the navy said. Canadian authorities were to assess the three fishermen's health once they boarded the coast guard ship.","Three fishermen's boat capsizes; they paddle raft eight miles to island .

"(CNN) -- Here we go again. The perennial question of: ""Would you rather own shares in a major financial conglomerate or manage one?"" comes up as JPMorgan Chase loses more than $2 billion in trading bets. The answer seems clear. If you're an executive who manages the money, you're likely to get a large paycheck and bonus even if you're responsible for the loss, directly or indirectly. Jamie Dimon is still getting his $23 million. Shares of the major banks continue to trade well below book value and generate miserable performance metrics -- and have over the years been very poor investments -- while senior executives and key employees continue to walk away with vastly outsize earnings, even when they oversee massive losses. Shareholders certainly have reasons to object to huge executive pay packages, especially ordinary people whose fund managers have put in stakes of the bank shares in their pension and mutual fund accounts. But the level of executive compensation comes out of shareholders' pockets. If shareholders are unhappy with the division of the spoils, they have no one to blame but themselves. After all, they can always take their money elsewhere if they don't think their cut of bank profits is big enough. The real concern for everyone -- including regulators and taxpayers -- is not the level of pay handed out to executives, nor how profits in a company are divided between employees and shareholders, but rather, the incentives for risk-taking that bank pay apparently continues to create. Regulators have called for deferred compensation to address the incentive problem. If deferred compensation presents employees with serious exposure to potentially big losses, they'll have a major stake in the long-term solvency of the business and help spare taxpayers the cost of bailing out firms that have become too systemically important to fail. But forcing employees to bear significant exposure to potentially big losses may come at a price. Employees may require higher salaries to compensate for increased risk. We're seeing this reflected in recently announced pay packages. The price is paid primarily by shareholders while the benefits of any improvement in financial stability accrue to society as a whole. Deferred cash compensation makes employees debt holders, so it ought to reduce risk-taking. So should compensation in a form that explicitly converts to equity when the firm gets into trouble and is bailout-proof. Deferred stock compensation, however, may do just the opposite. As long as there are implicit government guarantees for financial institutions that are considered too big, too complex or too interconnected to fail, the value of those institutions' stocks increases with risk-taking. The more risk a bank takes, the greater the value of government guarantees and potential bailouts. This value gets passed on to the bank's stock price. If employees are paid in deferred stock, the risk incentives are then passed on to them, encouraging them to speculate. Rules that mandate more pay in the form of stock miss the point. It helps align the interests of employees and shareholders, but it fails to align their interests with those of taxpayers. Ultimately, it's the taxpayers who are held hostage. They care about the size of bailout necessitated by excessive risk-taking taken by banks, and about economic growth, but not about how bank profits are divided per se, since they don't get a cut in any case. Regulators are aware that bank stockholders have an overriding desire to take more risk than is good for society because chronic under-pricing of government guarantees makes it profitable for banks to seek risky assets and lever them as much as possible. This is the reason for capital requirements and the Volcker Rule, which tries to restrict risk-taking. Recent attempts to reform compensation overlook how complicated the compensation process can be. Trying to discourage risky behavior is like fighting an uphill battle against shareholders who like risk. Moreover, risk incentives are harder to measure, and their regulation is easy to circumvent. Criticizing the compensation packages of JPMorgan's Dimon and his senior associates might be popular with voters, but regulators would be better off focusing on the source of the problem -- the mispricing of government guarantees that create perverse risk incentives in the first place. Pricing deposit insurance differently or banning activities such as proprietary trading would give shareholders and employees alike an incentive to rein in risk-taking. Employee compensation would then reform itself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ingo Walter and Jennifer Carpenter.","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon gets $23 million pay package despite the bank's $2 billion loss .

"London (CNN) -- The once-taboo topic of Greece's exit from the common currency is now being openly discussed. Two years of pushing cash into the country have barely kept it afloat and the collapse of political talks this week injected a new urgency into the situation. The potential for a run on the banks increased with the admission by the country's president Karolos Papoulias that up to â‚¬800 million ($900 million), was pulled out of the banks Monday. It is a tiny slice of total deposits but a trend, Papoulias noted, that could create ""fear that could develop into panic."" Greece, which is facing its fifth year of recession, will go to a second election June 17 after its May 6 voting left no single party with more than 20% support and negotiations to create a unity government failed. An interim government has now been sworn in. An unplanned exit from the eurozone could cost up to $1 trillion, according to Doug McWilliams, of the Centre for Economics and Business Research. McWilliams noted: ""The end of the euro in its current form is a certainty. A currency with the name euro may survive but even if it does it will be radically transformed."" Negotiations between Greece and its lenders might seem a game of chicken, and analysts remains skeptical the end-game is near. But the odds are increasing -- gaming house Ladbrokes even stopped taking bets on a Greek exit from the eurozone -- despite the legal, financial and political difficulties. CNN explains how it could happen. Legal hurdles . Greece could be forced to exit the European Union, rather than just the common currency itself, because one comes hand in hand with the other. The European Central Bank has the exclusive right to issue euro notes, for example, so any move by Greece to print its own currency would immediately put it in breach of the treaty. Changing the treaty would take some time, so a more likely maneuver is an agreement between euro nations on when and how they would boot Greece out of the bloc. According to Charles Proctor, partner at Edwards Wildman Palmer, ""the dam has burst, because so many people are now talking about [an exit]. It is not a possibility that can be ignored."" However the legal difficulties mean ""any solution would have to take place effectively outside this document."" A withdrawal from the eurozone by Greece ""would be breach of the treaty without any question,"" Proctor added. ""But these things happen."" Getting back the small change . Greece could revert to the drachma -- the currency it had before entering the euro in 2001 -- but there is also speculation it could operate with a Greece-specific euro until a full switch can take place. If Argentina is used as a guide, this could be announced over a weekend. The banks could then remain shut for a fortnight while the currency transition is bedded in. At this point capital controls would need to be in place to ensure money in the country stays there. This could be done in co-ordination with other euro countries, or unilaterally. According to a Bank of America/Merrill Lynch note, Greek banks have lost 30% of their private sector deposits since their peak in late 2009. Such capital flight is likely to be increasing and the fear -- as articulated by Papoulias -- is that an emotional response to the crisis will create even greater problems. As UBS's Paul Donovan, notes, ""talk of firewalls and guarantees disappears in a puff of smoke if the challenge for banks is not liquidity, nor solvency, but an existential crisis."" The new currency would be worth significantly less -- estimates put it at perhaps 50% -- than the euro. According Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, the country could then issue IOUs to pay salaries and recapitalize the banks. This, however, would risk the creation of a ""shadow currency."" The note adds: ""How long Greece could be within the euro and live with its own internal currency is an open debate."" Once the new currency is in place, mortgages to Greek banks would likely be repaid in drachma, while repayments of mortgages to foreign banks may have to be renegotiated. The biggest issue could be foreign banks' loans to major Greek businesses. Debt which was previously due to be repaid in euros would have be renegotiated in drachma. Legal disputes are likely to ensue as creditors battle to get back as much money as they can. Payback time . Creditors attempting to squeeze their money out of Greece could be out of luck. The International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank are the country's most senior creditors and defaulting on these debts would be politically unpalatable. But there are precedents: Sudan, Zimbabwe and Somalia, for example, remain in arrears to the IMF. Private creditors have already taken 50% losses on their investments in Greek debt but are likely to face further reductions in repayments. Money owed to Greece's eurozone peers, via the bailout fund, would likely be up for some ferocious negotiation. The flow-on effect . The so-called ""contagion effect"" remains the greatest fear. Allowing one country to exit the euro opens the floodgates for others to follow. This risk will push up the premium attached to buying sovereign debt of troubled eurozone economies -- such as that of Spain and Italy, whose ten year bonds are nudging toward the ""danger zone"" of 7% yield -- on the back of the uncertainty. According to Michala Marcussen, of Societe Generale, the direct costs of Greek euro exit would be huge for Greece, but manageable for the rest of the bloc. ""Our concern is contagion,"" she wrote in a note. The note said a forceful policy response would be needed in the case of a Greek exit, such as further strengthening of the bloc's bailout fund. A Greek exit could also trigger shifts in geo-political influence, as countries such as Russia may step up with financial assistance. According to James Nixon, of Societe Generale: ""The risk is we may lose Greece from the Western sphere of influence."" Is Greece actually going to exit the euro? The next few weeks will be vital for Greece, and the future of the eurozone. Much depends on the results of the new election. Greece's Syriza party -- which wants to remain in the eurozone but does not support the bailout program -- has thus far reaped the benefits of voter frustration with the austerity measures. It bumped out mainstream party PASOK to come second in the May 6 election, with almost 17%. Opinion polls indicate it could come first in the next election. New Democracy, which supports the program, narrowly won the May 6 election with almost 19% support. It could get a boost if sentiment shifts and fear of a euro exit drives Greeks back to the mainstream parties. If this happens, the crisis could ease. Economists remain unconvinced an exit is the next step. Nixon believes the ""huge poker game"" between Greece and its creditors is set to continue. ""There is still some distance to the last chance saloon,"" he says. If it did, the consequences could be dire, Donovan notes.

A new currency would take some time to find its true value, as markets adjust to Greece being outside the eurozone bloc. In Argentina's case, its break with the U.S. dollar peg in 2002 -- which devalued the peso by 30% -- sank its economy, with 60% of Argentines under the poverty line, according to the CIA Factbook. However, the economy then rebounded around 8.5% annually for six years. If Greece unshackles its currency it will become a more competitive exporter and an attractively cheap tourist destination. But Greeks, who have suffered rising unemployment, brutal austerity measures and protests which have claimed lives, will be forced to pay higher prices for imported goods. The country's economy -- which accounts for just 5% of the European Union's economic output and relies on agriculture and tourism -- would likely take years to recover.

"(CNN) -- Sports fans may have been deprived of another chance to see Lionel Messi stake his claim to be considered the greatest footballer of all time after Barcelona failed to progress to the final of the Champions League. But far from the bright lights of Munich's Allianz Arena, in a quiet corner of England, another athlete was busy rewriting the history books. Humans have been selectively breeding racehorses for 300 years, always in search of that elusive specimen of equine perfection who can redefine our idea of what might be possible on four legs. In Frankel, we may have found it. In action for the first time since last October in the Group 1 Lockinge Stakes at Newbury, for his trainer, Henry Cecil, it was a chance to show the world that his colt had overcome a leg injury sustained on Newmarket gallops, news of which had sent shockwaves throughout the racing world. Brutal beauty . For his jockey, Tom Queally, it was a chance to prove that the four-year-old Frankel was a more mature, calmer beast than the Frankel of last season, without losing any of his domineering physicality or brutal beauty. For Frankel, it was first blood in a senior campaign that could see him elevated to the ranks of the best Thoroughbreds ever to grace a racetrack. Sent off at odds as short of 1-4 -- meaning a $4 bet would earn you just $1 -- the undefeated son of Galileo was always going to have to be at this best to overcome a field that included Aiden O'Brien's improving colt Excelebration (who surely would be considered a superstar in his own right had he not had the misfortune to be racing in the same era as Frankel). As expected, the pacemaker Bullet Train (a half-brother to Frankel) set a strong early gallop, with Frankel tucked in second place. All-devouring stride . But when Queally pulled the pin with three furlongs to go, it felt more like a coronation than a contest, Frankel's all devouring stride putting more and more distance between him and a somewhat subdued Excelebration, who finished five lengths back. The victory means Frankel extends his unbeaten run to 10 from 10. His next appearance is likely to be the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot, when he will face some of the best milers in Europe. After that, Cecil has indicated a step up in trip will be the next logical step, to see if Frankel can reproduce his devastating form over distances of up to a mile and a half. Such is Frankel's superiority over his rivals that Queally rarely has to ask him to hit top speed (indeed, far more familiar is the sight of the hulking colt taking a strong hold as Queally tries to restrain him). The result is the Frankel has not run a race to trouble the handicappers since his devastating performance in the 2,000 Guineas last year. In spite of that, Frankel has a Timeform rating of 143, the third-highest of all time, behind the great Sea Bird II (145) and Brigadier General and Tudor Minstrel (both on 144). Black Caviar showdown? Is there a horse in the world who can push Frankel to the kind of performance that would see him take his rightful place at the top of the all-time list? An Australian mare by the name of Black Caviar may have something to say about that. She will also be at Royal Ascot, although she will run in the sprinter's Diamond Jubilee Stakes. Such is the clamor in the racing world for a Frankel-Black Caviar showdown, billionaire owner Sheikh Fahad al Thani has offered a purse of $1.6 million if they both line up for the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood, a race that Frankel won last year. Cecil has indicated he would love to see the two best horses in the world face each other, although Black Caviar's trainer, Peter Moody, remains cautious about exposing his mare over Frankel's preferred distance of a mile on the undulating Goodwood track. Whether or not the equine 'battle of the sexes' ever materializes, the racing world has one more season to savor the exploits of the giant bay with the white star before his career follows its inevitable trajectory towards the breeding shed. A horse like Frankel doesn't come along every day. Enjoy him while you can.","Frankel races to 10th win in 10 races with victory at Newbury .

"Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- Alan Tolbert is not your average 13-year-old. While other kids his age spent their Saturday shopping at the mall or tossing around a football, Tolbert traveled from Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, to Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington dressed in a navy blue Civil War reenactment uniform and armed with a brass bugle. Surrounding him at the historical site were nearly 200 other buglers and trumpeters from all over the United States, some even coming from as far away as California. A head shorter than his comrades, Tolbert's costume was a tad too big -- so big, in fact, that his mother had to roll up the bottom of his pants three times to make them fit. He didn't seem to notice, though. All he cared about was playing the 24 notes that make up taps. It is perhaps the most famous of military signals, and on Saturday it turned 150 years old. Taps, traditionally played at military funerals and also known as ""Butterfield's Lullaby"" or ""Day is Done,"" were born during the Civil War along the James River. Gen. Daniel Butterfield, unhappy with the lights-out call, decided to change the nightly tune to a softer melody, ending up with the tune played today. Currently, taps are played at the cemetery about 30 times daily, most notably at the Tomb of the Unknowns. To commemorate the 150th anniversary, Buglers Across America, a nonprofit organization that seeks to play live renditions for veteran funerals rather than subject the mourners to a CD version, enlisted nearly 200 volunteer buglers and trumpeters. The musicians joined together and played a united taps performance before they set off in search of a single soldier's tombstone in the 624-acre burial ground. Some chose a spot simply for its convenient location. Others, like Tolbert, chose them for their significance. One of the youngest volunteers, he selected the grave of Johnny Clem, a 10-year-old Civil War drummer who became a sergeant by the time he turned 12. Tolbert usually plays taps by himself but said it was a great opportunity to play with some of the best buglers in the country on the hallowed ground of the cemetery. He admitted he didn't think a military career was in his future, though. ""I don't think I want to be in the military one day, so the best I can do to serve our country is to honor those who are,"" Tolbert said. For those who did serve in the military, playing taps in Arlington National Cemetery is one of the greatest honors for a bugler. Well-known bugle historian and 23-year veteran Jari Villanueva explained that for him, it's his way of paying back those who fought for America. ""Whether it would be after a career, 20, 30 years, or even those who have died on active duty, it's our way of officially saying to the military, 'Thank you. Safely rest. God is nigh,'"" he explained, quoting the final lyrics associated with the melody. Allison Cummings, a patrol officer from Hudson, New Hampshire, usually plays taps at law enforcement funerals and ceremonies in her home state, but said playing in Arlington was a unique experience. ""I started playing the trumpet when I was in fifth grade so I've been playing for quite a while... Even from that age, I remember visiting here when I just started playing,"" said Cummings, dressed in a black uniform trimmed in gold with her trumpet hanging by her side. ""This is like Carnegie Hall for me. This is just an incredible experience."" ""[Bugling is] just that final honor to someone who's served their country, and it's just such an honor to play that for them,"" Cummings said as she stood opposite the grave she was about to serenade, fingering a commemorative gold coin she would lay to rest on the white marble headstone after her performance. ""It's for the family as well, but I think of it as playing to that person, just a final thank you for what they did.""","The well-known bugle call's 150th anniversary was Saturday .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese Super League club Shanghai Shenhua have pulled off an audacious transfer coup by signing former France international Nicolas Anelka from English team Chelsea. Images of the striker were splashed across the Shanghai team's official website Monday, together with a statement saying the 32-year-old would be joining the club in January on a two-year contract. The move was later confirmed by Chelsea, who signed Anelka for Â£15 million in 2008 but accepted his transfer request with his current deal to expire at the end of this season. ""This is not only good for Shenhua but also beneficial for Chinese football,"" club spokesperson Ma Yue told CNN. ""The joining of Anelka to Football Association Super League will promote the League's brand for sure."" No details were given about how much the contract was worth, but a club official denied reports that Anelka's weekly salary would be as high as Â£200,000 ($312,000). Anelka has rarely featured for Chelsea this season under new manager Andre Villas-Boas, and was almost certain to leave Stamford Bridge during European football's January transfer window after asking to leave. The Versailles-born player, who became a Muslim in 2004, has scored 59 goals in 184 games for the club. Having played for some of Europe's top teams, including Spain's Real Madrid and England's Arsenal and Liverpool, Anelka's transfers have so far totaled almost $133 million, making him one of the world's most expensive players in those terms. However, his questionable attitude during his early career led to him being nicknamed ""Le Sulk"" at Arsenal and being banned for 45 days at Real after refusing to train. In 2008, Anelka moved to Chelsea in a Â£15 million deal from Bolton, where he resurrected his career after a short spell in Turkey with Fenerbahce. He helped the London club win the domestic championship in 2009-10. Anelka's international career came to a controversial halt during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, when he was sent home in disgrace after clashing with coach Raymond Domenech. He was given an 18-match ban after refusing to apologize, but said he had already decided to retire from the national team. Reports have also linked Shenhua with another veteran Chelsea striker, Didier Drogba -- a target of Chinese rivals Dalian Aerbin. Meanwhile, Shenhua owner Zhu Jun said last week that former France international Jean Tigana will become the club's new coach, according to the Shanghai Daily website. ""Tigana should be in the city by the middle of this month. He had already made a one-year coaching plan for the team,"" Zhu said. Shenhua finished 11th in the 16-team Chinese Super League this year, having been runners-up in 2005, 2006 and 2008.

"New York (CNN) -- Mary Richardson Kennedy was remembered Saturday as a best friend who lived life to the fullest while battling depression. ""She was brilliant and she was beautiful and she cared so very very deeply about everybody around her,"" said longtime friend and sister-in-law Kerry Kennedy. ""She loved her children more than anything else."" Mary Kennedy, the estranged wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was found dead Wednesday in Bedford, New York, the small town north of New York City where she lived. She died of asphyxiation due to hanging, the Westchester County medical examiner said. Who was Mary Kennedy? A private memorial service was held Saturday at St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in Bedford. Among those attending were Glenn Close, Chevy Chase, Susan Sarandon and Larry David. Mary, 52, was buried near Hyannisport, Massachusetts, where the Kennedy family has a compound. She married Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in 1994. The prominent environmental lawyer is the third of 11 children born to Ethel and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was gunned down in 1968. The assassination was one of a string of tragedies to befall the Kennedy family, America's royal family in the absence of monarchy. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, five years before his younger brother. More than three decades later, in 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr.; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy; and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, died when a plane he was piloting crashed in the waters off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. David Kennedy died of a drug overdose in 1984, and Michael Kennedy was killed in a skiing accident in 1997. Both were sons of Robert F. Kennedy Sr. The details of the couple's private life surfaced after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed for divorce in 2010. After that, Mary Kennedy was charged once with driving while intoxicated and once with driving while impaired by prescription drugs, according to Bedford police. Her family criticized media accounts of her death for what they called ""inaccuracies and misrepresentations"" of her life. Kerry Kennedy talked about Mary's depression. ""She was battling those demons,"" Kerry Kennedy said. ""She was an angel who was brought to live with us here on Earth. God just brought her back up to heaven and said, 'You don't have to fight for me anymore.'""","Private memorial service for Mary Kennedy was held in Bedford, New York .

"(CNN) -- The unrest among Tibetans in western areas of China appeared to take another macabre turn over the weekend with reports that a mother of four and a middle school student died after setting themselves on fire in separate protests against Chinese rule. The acts -- which the Chinese government has not confirmed -- would bring the total number of reported self-immolations by Tibetans in China during the past year to more than 20, according to estimates from advocacy groups. They follow an increase in security measures by the Chinese authorities in the region in response to the unrest of recent months and ahead of the sensitive anniversary of protests by Tibetan monks four years ago that ended in bloodshed. The mother of four, a 32-year-old woman named Rinchen, set herself alight Sunday in front of Kirti Monastery in the county of Aba, which Tibetans call Ngaba, in Sichuan Province, the Tibetan advocacy group Free Tibet said in a statement. ""A mother of four young children travelled to Ngaba to set fire to herself in the town that has become the heart of both protest and repression in Tibet,"" Stephanie Brigden, the director of Free Tibet, said in the statement. Brigden declined by telephone to specify how the organization, which campaigns against Chinese rule in the Tibetan region, got the information for fear of endangering its sources. Rinchen's death was also reported by Radio Free Asia, a nonprofit group funded by the U.S. government. Radio Free Asia cited Kanyak Tsering, a Tibetan monk with connections to Kirti Monastery who lives in Dharamsala, the Indian town where the Tibetan government in exile resides. An official from Aba County's politics and law committee office said Monday that the authorities had ""heard nothing about any self-immolation this weekend."" He declined to give his name. Calls seeking comment from the local police station in the town of Aba went unanswered. The other reported self-immolation was carried out Saturday by Tsering Kyi, a female middle school student aged 18 or 19, at a vegetable market in the county of Maqu, or Machu in Tibetan, in Gansu Province, according to Brigden of Free Tibet. The Chinese authorities closed the market following the act and still hold Tsering Kyi's body, Brigden said, attributing the information to three unidentified people in the area, including one who said they witnessed the events first hand. Radio Free Asia also reported the death of a female middle school student in Maqu on Saturday, citing an ""exile source"" with local contacts. Local officials in Maqu were not available for comment on the matter Monday. Chinese state-run media have confirmed that some self-immolations have taken place in the provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai in recent months. This month will mark the fourth anniversary of protest marches by Tibetan monks in Lhasa that ended violently in 2008. Tibetans say the situation escalated to violence when Chinese police beat monks who had been protesting peacefully; Chinese authorities claim Tibetans launched attacks on Chinese businesses. Officially the death toll is under 20; Tibetans in exile say the death toll is near 150. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Advocacy group: a 32-year-old woman set herself alight Sunday in front of a monastery .

"(CNN) -- Officers from multiple agencies in western Washington state were looking for a suspect who fled a courthouse Friday after allegedly shooting a female officer and stabbing a judge who came to her assistance, officials said. Undersheriff Rick Scott said the man gave his name as Michael Thomas when the officer approached him shortly after noon inside the Grays Harbor County Courthouse in Montesano. ""He attacked her with a sharp-edged instrument,"" Scott said. ""The judge rushed to the aid of the officer and actually struck the suspect physically, knocking him off of the deputy."" The suspect cut Superior Court Judge David Edwards in the neck. Deputy Polly Davin attempted to draw her weapon, but the suspect was able to knock her to the floor and take her weapon, officials said. The suspect fired twice, hitting the deputy once in the shoulder. Seattle affiliate KING said the man left the courthouse with the handgun. Edwards and Davin were in satisfactory condition at Grays Harbor Community Hospital, spokesman David Quigg said. ""They are comfortable and doing well,"" said Quigg, declining to detail the extent of their injuries. The suspect was still on the loose, Scott told CNN. CNN Seattle affiliate KIRO aired footage of officers in a residential neighborhood in Montesano. ""They believe he could be in a location in the area,"" said Trooper Russ Winger, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol. ""They believe he is armed."" Scott said officials were not certain of the suspect's true identity. The incident occurred in Montesano, the county seat for Grays Harbor County, west of Olympia and near the Pacific Coast. Many offices and buildings were placed in lockdown. According to KIRO, a man garnered the attention of courthouse employees and the officer approached him. The suspect was well-dressed and possibly carrying a briefcase, Winger said. Montesano Police did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment. Gov. Chris Gregoire appointed Edwards to the bench in December 2007.","Both of the wounded are in satisfactory condition .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- On first glance, the new, never-to-be-actually-named iPad is exactly the same as its predecessor: Same size, same price, same colors. But guts count for something. And the guts of the new iPad -- don't you dare call it iPad 3 -- are what make this tablet computer a step forward from the iPad 2. They're also what give Apple execs some room to claim this device as ""amazing"" and ""revolutionary,"" rather than run-of-the-mill and incremental. The truth is that the new Apple iPad probably falls somewhere in the middle. It's neither dud nor game-changer. I got to handle the new tablet for a few minutes after Apple's launch event Wednesday. My first impressions: . The screen . The main upgrade is the screen, which is markedly crisper. Apple says it quadrupled the number of pixels on the iPad's 9.7-inch display to the point that there are now 3.1 million pixels on the screen, with a total resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels. Color saturation on the device was increased 44% relative to the iPad 2, the company says. ""Your retina in your eye cannot discern those individual pixels,"" Apple's Phil Schiller said at the news conference. ""The images on it look stunning."" CNNMoney: New iPad up close . That's not overstatement. Images do seem to have jumped out of the real world. That's good for people who want to watch movies, look at photos and play games on the new iPad. It also could be a big step forward for people who want to read digital books on the device. Enlarge the text on the latest-gen iPad, and the letters maintain their quality. The edges of the fonts are perfectly smooth, as if they're molded from plastic. ""One of the iPad's biggest competitors has been paper,"" said Nick Bilton, a tech columnist at The New York Times, ""and now this is better than paper."" Gaming . Another new feature of the guts: The A5X ""quad-core"" chip, which is supposed to help render graphics much more quickly. This could be a boon for gamers, who likely will see high-resolution and more graphics-intensive games coming out for the tablet. In a short demo on Wednesday, a flying game called ""Sky Gamblers"" looked like nothing you would expect to see on a mobile device. Mountains and valleys appear photo-realistic, and the steam coming out of the back of the plane warps the sky around it. During its presentation, Apple highlighted gaming as a big advantage of the latest iPad. ""This new device has more memory and higher screen resolution than an Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3,"" said Mike Capps, president of Epic Games. Apps . Apple announced several new ones, and while these should work on older versions of the iPad, they're designed to take advantage of the new tablet's better screen. iPhoto is among the standouts. Apple's photo-organization software really comes to life on the high-def iPad, where users will be able to sharpen their photos with new features. One detects the horizon in a landscape photo and, with the tap of a finger, will make it perfectly level. Another lets users rub a finger over a section of a photograph to lighten, darken or soften it. It makes photo editing more hands-on and intuitive than before. Connectivity . While it's far from clear that tablet owners really want to connect to the Internet over cellular data networks (rather than Wi-Fi, which is often free but, of course, isn't available everywhere), the new iPad has 4G capabilities for those who do. In a demo, Apple reps showed videos loading considerably faster on the new iPad than on the iPad 2. Again, this plays into Apple's hope that this will be an even-better device for viewing media. ""This new iPad has the most wireless bands of any device that has ever shipped, and it is truly revolutionary,"" Apple's Phil Schiller said during a news conference. Who's to say whether these updates will lead people to want to purchase the new iPad, or to upgrade from a previous version. Nothing about the iPad was completely overhauled, but the overall user experience is crisper and speedier than before. We'll leave you to be the judge. Let us know what you think of these updates in the comments section. Does this new iPad sound like it's worth the cash?","CNN's John Sutter gets his hands on a new iPad at Wednesday's launch event .
The fundamentals of the device haven't changed much .
You have to look at the guts of the tablet to see what's new .

"(Mashable) -- Facebook users receive more comments, messages and likes -- the hugs and high-fives of social networking -- than they give, according to a new study. The Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Projectstudy, which looks at Facebook activity of users over a one-month period, shows that users ""like"" content on their News Feed about 14 times, while their content is Liked about 20 times. Users send about nine personal messages and receive 12. This discrepancy exists because certain ""power users"" dominate one kind of Facebook action. Meaning everyone has friends that excessively tag photos, send messages or ""like"" things all the time. Others obsessively ""friend"" people. Power users -- specializing in one of the activities describes above -- make up between 20% to 30% of the Facebook population. ""The striking thing is that there are different power users depending on the activity in question,"" says Keith Hampton, the study's lead author. ""One group of power users dominates friending activity. Another dominates 'liking' activity. And yet another dominates photo tagging."" The research was conducted by a national phone survey targeting adults and teenagers in America who use Facebook.

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner drew a hard line in the sand this week, renewing a battle over the debt ceiling unless President Barack Obama agreed to significant budget cuts during what may be a lame-duck session after the November elections. This could set the stage for a dire scenario that threatens to bring the government to a crawl by Christmas. But brinksmanship tactics from both sides are not new -- in fact, they are all too commonplace on both sides in this Congress as the value of the compromise among moderate voices has all but disappeared. And it appears many voters want it that way. Fiscal cliff: What you need to know . What may be different today is that, as the country looks around for reasonable, moderate statesmen and women on both sides to go behind closed the doors and broker a deal, their choices are becoming more limited. Congressional moderates, it seems, are a dying breed. Where once such names as Bob Packwood and Ted Kennedy in the Senate symbolized bipartisan compromise in Congress, today the slow end of the compromiser has been hastened in part by frustrated voters who in polls say they are tired of political infighting and legislative gridlock. But these are often the same voters have recently shoved aside longtime moderates in favor of more extreme candidates. Just ask U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana, the centrist Republican who after 35 years in office was defeated by tea party favorite Richard Mourdock last week in the GOP primary. Or discouraged Maine moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe, who is retiring this year after being frustrated with the lack of compromise in the Senate. Or any of the Blue Dog Democrats who were voted out in 2010. ""The electorate is frustrated. They are clearly unhappy. The response is to vote for those who stand up and say 'I'm not like the rest of these guys,' "" said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and co-author of the book ""It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism."" Senate's all-day budget debate dominated by politics . Congress has a 78% disapproval rating, according to an analysis by Real Clear Politics. The distaste for Beltway politics has been demonstrated in recent elections across the country where moderates were ousted in favor of candidates who vowed to take a tougher line on upholding party values. Mourdock's Facebook page boasts a string of congratulatory nods from conservatives and an ominous warning from those who voted for him. ""Remember to represent the State of Indiana not forgetting us, and what we Hoosiers stand for,"" voter Roger Smith wrote. ""Dick Lugar forgot we are the Bible-belt Hoosier Christian values, and that we believe in our Constitution which he took an oath to uphold and defend but instead did his best to destroy."" Lugar backed portions of the Obama administration's energy and immigration agenda and even supported the president's Supreme Court choices. When he lost a recent primary battle to the far more ideologically rigid Mourdock, Lugar fired off a statement harshly criticizing the increasingly polarized political climate. ""If that attitude prevails in American politics, our government will remain mired in the dysfunction we have witnessed during the last several years,"" Lugar wrote. Avlon: Grow up, Congress -- make a deal on debt . Snowe grew so fed up with the current climate in Washington that she decided not to run for a fourth term. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska; Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut; Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia; Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota; and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-New Mexico, are centrist-leaning lawmakers who are also retiring. ""People are just stunned by the debilitating partisanship, polarization and the overall dysfunction of the institution and political paralysis as we come, you know, to the point of extreme when it comes to resolving the problems facing our country,"" a frustrated Snowe told CNN in February. ""It's become an all or nothing proposition and that failure has eroded the public's confidence about the direction of this country and about governing institutions to be at the front lines of solving these problems."" In states and districts that slightly favor one party and have been traditionally represented by moderates from the opposite party, the very lawmakers viewed as ""problem solvers"" are tossed out in favor of those who promise change, Ornstein said. During the 2010 midterm elections, for instance, roughly half of the 50 Blue Dogs, a group of moderate Democrats who largely hail from conservative leaning Southern and Midwestern districts, were voted out of office. Former U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, D-Georgia, knows the perils of such trends all too well. Despite his reputation as one of the most fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats -- he voted against and promised to help reform the health care reform law -- Marshall was unable to fend off a 2010 challenge in his Republican-leaning district by Austin Scott, who was backed by the tea party. ""It's difficult for Congress to draft legislation that makes sense for America because we are ideologically driven on both sides,"" Marshall said. ""It's really difficult for these folks to come together for a compromise. You'll hear members say, 'I have to watch my base.' "" The current era of partisanship was ushered in by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Ornstein said. Although the former Republican presidential candidate would say he and former President Bill Clinton cut deals that led to a record budget surplus and the biggest economic boom in modern American history, many say the Georgia Republican's ideologically unyielding, take-no-prisoners brand of leadership ushered in an era of heel-digging politics that persists to this day. But ideological stubbornness may be just one ingredient in the recipe for congressional paralysis. Throw in congressional redistricting, which has made it more difficult for moderates to run and win. Judicial nominations are stalled. Legislation that sails through the House is often dead on arrival in the Senate. Even issues that appear to have bipartisan support -- such as capping student loan interest rates -- get stuck in the goo of Congress. Next, add primary rule changes that only allow registered party members to vote and a polarized electorate whose grassroots efforts have put tremendous pressure on lawmakers to stay true to a more narrow interpretation of party values.

"(CNN) -- You most likely know Pierce Brosnan from his work as 007, but he's actually been quite busy since his Bond days. Rom-com roles, quirky indie flicks here and there and spending time developing his own projects through his company Irish DreamTime gives you the sense that this is a guy who's dedicated to not only the craft of acting, but also to working instead of coasting on any prior associations. For his latest project, a TV mini-series adaptation of Stephen King's 1998 novel, ""Bag of Bones,"" he portrays Mike Noonan, a writer who seems to be going slowly insane at a remote lake town after his wife's death. It's a typical King thriller, with a host of supernatural and psychological twists. As ""Remington Steel,"" Brosnan got his start on the small screen so there's no mystery as to whether he could pull it off -- but with the creativity found on television these days, the medium is ripe for a versatile workaholic like Brosnan. The actor recently spoke with CNN about his return to TV, how he brought King's character to life and what he thinks of the Bond franchise now. CNN: ""Bag of Bones"" is one of the first big returns for you to television since ""Remington Steele."" Brosnan: I haven't done TV in a good number of years. But I've been saying to my agent, ""Look, please do not rule out TV. I enjoy it, I started my career there, it's such fertile ground."" So, I got ""Bag of Bones."" The timing was great, I love Stephen King ... I'd done one of his short stories a long time ago, called ""The Lawnmower Man."" CNN: What's exciting about this medium to you these days? Brosnan: It's a corporate world out there in the world of movie making. It's really hard to raise the finances, as a filmmaker myself. It's just really hard going. I have two pieces with my own company, Irish DreamTime that are in development, that we just got the writers on and just got the heads-up from the studio. Two shows that I would be in from time to time. It's just interesting work out there. We've started writing the scripts ... I don't really want to talk about them right now, it's a little bit premature. The one that's going to be a half-hour show, it's very cool. Comes from the world of ""Dexter,"" it has a sick attitude about it. TV is very exciting; it's get in, get out. This particular piece, ""Bag of Bones,"" happened so quickly. I had two weeks off before the last job I had, before moving into this. You can come away from a day's work absolutely exhausted, but exhilarated, because it's so fast. CNN: What's critical to bringing a King story to screen? His world's are so rich as you're reading it, but for a visual medium, it's different. Brosnan: (Director) Mick Garris is the one you have to tip your hat to. He's extremely prepared and passionate and knows the King world so well. King trusts Nick implicitly. Garris and I didn't talk too much about it. It was fairly self-evident what had to be done with the story. At first I thought it was overly written with stage directions and it kind of irked me where it was telling me how to act here. As the piece wore on, the weeks went by, I realized more and more of the stage direction. CNN: There's not a lot of dialogue between you and other characters. It was more the inner-conflicts that we see play out. How does one approach a role like that? Brosnan: The first three weeks it was just me in a house. It was like ""Diary of a Madman."" There was only one person on the call sheet and that was me. That was a unique way to work and I actually found it extremely pleasant; I didn't have to deal with any other actors (laughs). I could just have my own timing and my own emotional world, all to myself. That only goes so far. It's hard to articulate how I got there, but it's somewhat like ""Diary of a Madman."" CNN: Portraying fear is a critical aspect of a King story. How difficult is that? Brosnan: I didn't really have time to worry about that. How many ways can portray fear, things that go bump in the night, or how many expressions do you have up your sleeve? That's when you have to rely on the director, that he's going to be in the right place to get that look. CNN: How did the book translate to screen? Brosnan: It's pretty much there; I think it's better than the book. I found the book, at times, kind of slow and I thought the script had such a snap to it. You enjoy the sharp left turns that come at you. CNN: Does Stephen King consult on something like this? Brosnan: I think there was a great rapport between Garris and him. He didn't come down. I called him up before I went off to shoot it, just to say hello and get his blessing, so to speak. Stephen King is Stephen King. There's only one of him. He always has a point of view. CNN: Have you been following the ""Bond"" franchise? Brosnan: (Daniel Craig) is one great Bond. Certainly does a magnificent job. CNN: He's a tough one. A tough dude. Brosnan: He's a tough dude. They have to. Big competition with ""Bourne Identity"" and one thing or another. He'll be right as rain. ""Bag of Bones"" is a two-part mini-series that airs Sunday December 11 and Monday December 12 on A&E.","Pierce Brosnan stars in a TV mini-series adaptation of Stephen King's 1998 novel, ""Bag of Bones""

"(CNN) -- The shadow of the moon swept across the globe from Hong Kong to the Texas Panhandle as a rare annular solar eclipse began Monday morning in Asia and traversed the Pacific. The sun appeared as a thin ring behind the moon to people in a narrow path along the center of the track, which began in southern China. Heavy clouds obscured the view in Hong Kong, but residents of Tokyo and other cities were able to get a spectacular view for about four minutes around 7:32 a.m. Monday (6:32 p.m. ET Sunday). Events were held at schools and museums in Japan, while many more people took in the unusual astronomical event at home or on street corners. After whizzing across the Pacific, the shadow emerged over northern California and southern Oregon, where thousands of people attended parties to watch the event, the first to appear in the United States since 1994. Experts warned that hopeful viewers should not peer up at the sky without special viewing equipment, since looking at the sun with the naked eye can cause blindness. Derek Ralston, a professional photographer, said he used a welding filter to capture a direct view of eclipse in the foothills above Oroville, California. He shared the photo on CNN iReport. Noting ""the rather slim swath of the globe who could see the impact of the eclipse,"" Ralston said he wanted to enable ""the rest of the world to see how clear it looked to those of us who were fortunate enough to see it."" The sliver of sunshine then traveled southeast across central Nevada, southern Utah and northern Arizona, and then New Mexico. It passed over Albuquerque, New Mexico, about 7:34 p.m. (9:34 p.m. ET) before petering out east of Lubbock, Texas, according to NASA. An annular eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and sun at the farthest point of its orbit, meaning it will block less than the entire sun. That leaves a large, bright ring around it as it passes. Patrick Wiggins, a NASA ambassador in Salt Lake City, said he always looked forward to seeing people's reactions to such events. ""You get everything from stoic, staring into the sky ... to people breaking down and crying, they're just so moved,"" he said. Aaron Lin, an 8th-grade student from Moraga, California, said a tree in his family's yard had served as unexpected natural viewing device on Sunday. The leaves of the tree, whose shadow falls on the side of the family's house, broke up the light from the eclipse into scores of tiny crescents on the wall, he said. ""I was so shocked by these shadows because it looked like a painting or computer art,"" said Aaron, 13. Did you view the eclipse? Share your photos with CNN iReport and they could be featured on CNN. The next solar eclipse will be on November 13, and is expected to be visible over northern Australia, according to NASA. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki, Tyson Wheatley and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Northern California gets a clear view of the ring of fire .

"(CNN) -- Authorities arrested Saturday a suspect who allegedly shot a female officer, stabbed a judge and fled a Washington state courthouse, an official said. Steven D. Kravetz, 34, was arrested at his mother's home in Olympia without incident, Undersheriff Rick Scott with the Grays Harbor County Sheriff's Department said. The mother called authorities to tell them where he was after hearing media reports about the incident, he said. Authorities also recovered a gun taken from the officer during the confrontation, Scott said. Scott said the man gave his name as Michael Thomas when the officer approached him shortly after noon Friday inside the Grays Harbor County Courthouse in Montesano. Authorities, however, later identified the suspect Kravetz on a poster seeking the public's help in finding him Saturday. The poster said Kravetz could be with Roberta Dougherty, whom CNN affiliates in the Seattle area identified as Kravetz's mother. Before the attack, Kravetz took a bus from Olympia to Montesano, CNN affiliate KOMO reported. He called his mom after the attack and she reportedly gave him a ride home, it said. ""He attacked (the officer) with a sharp-edged instrument,"" Scott said. ""The judge rushed to the aid of the officer and actually struck the suspect physically, knocking him off of the deputy."" The suspect cut Superior Court Judge David Edwards in the neck. Deputy Polly Davin attempted to draw her weapon, but the suspect knocked her to the floor and took the weapon, officials said. The suspect fired twice, hitting the deputy once in the shoulder. Seattle affiliates said the man left the courthouse with the handgun. ""He got the gun away from the deputy and went, 'Pop, pop!' And turned to look at me, and went out of the courthouse with the gun in his hand,"" Edwards said, KOMO reported. The judge told the station he had never seen the suspect before the incident. Both Edwards and the officer were treated and released from a hospital, authorities said. CNN's Phil Gast, Deanna Proeller, Greg Morrison and Maria P. White contributed to this report.","NEW: An injured judge says he never saw the suspect before, KOMO reports .

"(CNN) -- A speedboat carrying Britain's Prince Harry broke down in the Bahamas, but that didn't slow the royal down during his Caribbean tour. Prince Harry boarded a media boat after a mechanical failure stopped the Royal Bahamas Defence Force boat he was riding to Harbour Island on Sunday. Throngs of cheering crowds met him on the island, which the 27-year-old son of Prince Charles and Diana visited as part of a tour celebrating the 60th anniversary of his grandmother's accession to the throne. Island resident India Hicks, a bridesmaid in his parents' wedding, helped show him around the normally sleepy enclave. Prince Harry's Diamond Jubilee celebrations began Friday in the Belize capital Belmopan, where the prince danced and drank in a street party along the newly named HM Queen Elizabeth II Boulevard. The prince had a quieter day in Belize Saturday, climbing to the top of Xunantunich, a Mayan temple. He toured an open-air exhibit in Nassau's Rawson Square before boarding the speedboat Sunday. After a youth rally in the Bahamas National Stadium on Monday, Prince Harry was scheduled to travel to Jamaica and then on to Brazil to complete his 10-day tour. Diamond Jubilee celebrations marking six decades on the throne for Queen Elizabeth II officially began last month and continue through June, when London will mark the anniversary of her coronation with festivities including up to 1,000 boats sailing up the River Thames. The 85-year-old monarch has no political power, but she has immense power as a figurehead. She is officially the head of state of 16 countries that used to be part of the British Empire, including the Bahamas. CNN's Brian Vitagliano, Max Foster and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Prince Harry boards vessel carrying reporters after his boat breaks down .

"(CNN) -- The tiny landlocked nation of Rwanda may be known for its violent past but tourism officials are hoping, with the help of mountain gorillas, that travelers will see for themselves why the ""land of a thousand hills"" is worth a visit. MOUNTAIN GORILLAS . Rwanda is one of just three countries where the world's population of mountain gorillas can be observed in the wild. In addition to Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park, gorillas also inhabit Uganda's Mgahinga National Park and Democratic Republic of Congo's Virunga National Park. These parks border each other and the area the mountain gorillas call home is known as Virunga Massif. Volcanoes National Park is about two hours from Kigali, Rwanda's capital. The drive to the park will make it obvious why Rwanda is referred to as the ""land of a thousand hills."" Locals cultivate the lush green hills where the gorilla treks begin, and there are five volcanoes in the park. The scenery is stunning from a distance but it may lose its appeal as you make your climb in search of the gorillas, who will determine the altitude and incline of the hike. The trek up the mountain can be challenging, with thick brush, fire ants and stinging nettles. It can take minutes or hours depending on where the gorillas decide to rest. ""The gorillas don't need any visas or passports to leave one country and go to another one,"" the guide jokes as he leads a group of eight tourists up the side of the mountain. Lucky visitors will see the animals feeding and crushing through the underbrush, babies running around and full-grown gorillas inching toward observers loudly declaring their importance. Hikers are not permitted closer than 10 meters, but the gorillas are under no such restriction and may creep closer, as tourist heart rates increase. As with most wildlife tours there are no guarantees of gorilla sightings, but the odds of seeing them are good, according to Simon Gluckman, president of Intrepid Expeditions. ""In 11 years I've never had someone in Rwanda not see the gorillas,"" says Gluckman. Gluckman tells his clients to prepare for treks up to 9,000 feet above sea level. ""If the gorillas are moving one particular day and there is somebody having a hard time keeping up physically then that person may not see them."" Visitors need a permit to hike up the mountain in hopes of seeing a family of mountain gorillas. The cost is $500 per person and permits are limited to 56 a day. Permits should be purchased well in advance and they can be obtained through a tour company or directly from the issuing organization, the country's Tourism and Conservation Office. Included in the price are the guides assigned by the park. Once the mountain gorillas are located, visitors will spend an hour watching these incredible animals. ""We only have one tour a day for one hour in order to give the animals free range,"" says Felix Semivumbi, a guide in the area for 24 years. GOLDEN MONKEYS . Perhaps not as high-profile but also worth the time is a trip to see Rwanda's golden monkeys, and the price of the permit is less expensive than for gorillas: $100 per person. The monkeys are also located in Volcanoes National Park. This tour is a good way to get adjusted to the altitude, which when tracking the gorillas can be at elevations from 7,000 to 9,000 feet, and it offers a taste of what to expect on the mountain gorilla trek if visitors do this first. ""It's a shorter walk to the golden monkeys than the mountain gorillas"" since the gorillas are found at the higher altitude says Semivumbi. Unlike the gorillas, which move at a slower pace and tend to rest as a group in one place, the monkeys keep tourists on their toes. ""They are fast so we have to be fast,"" says Semivumbi. Once spotted you may be following the monkeys as they swing from the treetops overhead. Watching them you will realize how aptly named playground equipment such as monkey bars and jungle gyms are; only here the equipment is bamboo. Seeing these endangered animals in their natural habitat is worth an extra day in the area. There's only one tour per day for the monkeys and one overlapping tour for gorillas, so you can't visit both the big and small primates in the same day. MEMORIAL SITES . It's possible to visit several of Rwanda's many memorial sites commemorating the 1994 genocide in a day. Learning about the country's history is important in understanding the people and places you will encounter, says Rwandan Ambassador to the United States James Kimonyo. The Rwanda of today is a different place than the country that once dominated the news, he says. ""It is one of the safest places to visit,"" says Kimonyo. ""You can go out at night and not be bothered."" That wasn't the case less than two decades ago when ethnic violence in Rwanda erupted and Tutsis were systematically murdered by Hutus in 1994. It was a time when neighbors killed neighbors and old friends became bitter enemies. ""If you knew me and you really knew yourself you would not have killed me."" This quote by Felicien Ntagengwa, a survivor of the genocide, is found at genocide sites throughout the country including the Kigali Memorial Centre. Located in the capital, the Kigali Memorial should not be missed. It is a disturbing yet honest look at this country's horrific past. The center estimates that more than 1 million -- mostly Tutsis but also moderate Hutus -- were murdered within 100 days during the genocide. Exhibits introduce you to children such as 4-year-old Ariane Umutoni who was ""stabbed in her eyes and head."" Outside in the quiet courtyard, remains continue to be placed in mass graves as they are discovered. Many churches around the country are no longer places of worship but places to pay respect to those who died while trying to escape death. Instead of safe havens, some churches turned into places to find easy prey to massacre. Nyamata and Ntarama are two churches about an hour outside of Kigali. The bullet-riddled roofs and clothing of those killed are reminders of the people who huddled inside in hope of being spared. A guide at Nyamata Genocide Memorial said more than 10,000 people were killed at the church and in the immediate area. The yard of Nyamata is now a mass grave where freshly cut flowers are left by those who survived. Down in the crypt is a powerful display of reality that some may find unnecessary to view: rows upon rows of skulls and bones. People are still healing, but Rwandans have opened their past in order to embrace the future. Tourism is important in rebuilding, says Kimonyo, and thankfully Rwanda has enough natural and cultural history to make it worth a stamp in your passport.","Rwanda's natural attractions are drawing tourists to the tiny nation .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The fate of Iraq's newly revised election law again hinges on the approval of the country's Sunni Arab vice president, who is under pressure to sign the much-contested plan. The new bill has been approved by the other two members of the presidency council. Adel Abdul Mahdi, the country's Shiite vice president, issued a statement Thursday saying he and President Jalal Talabani, who is Kurdish, have put their signatures on it. But Tariq al-Hashimi, the country's Sunni Arab vice president, who vetoed the original election bill last week, continues to threaten to veto this revised measure, and Mahdi and Talabani are trying to persuade him to sign the document. Al-Hashimi's vote is key because in Iraq, legislation passed by the parliament must be ratified unanimously by the presidency council, made up of the country's two vice presidents and the president. ""All the efforts are devoted to have the entire presidency council approval on the the law, coming from the joint concern about elections to take place in the specified date,"" Mahdi said in a statement. But al-Hashimi said Wednesday that the ""veto is still an option and it will be used if I find that the current law doesn't conform to the [Iraqi] justice and the constitution."" The upcoming parliamentary elections and a law setting down rules for elections are seen as important barometers of Iraqi progress toward stability. The election is also key step in plans for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, About 115,000 American troops remain in Iraq, and the Obama administration plans to pull all but 30,000 to 50,000 of them out of the country by August. Al-Hashimi vetoed the Iraqi parliament's first election law last week, arguing it failed to provide enough seats for Iraqi refugees, many of whom are Sunnis. A revised bill passed by Iraq's parliament on Monday remains ""unconstitutional and unfair,"" al-Hashimi said in a statement issued by his office. The previous law ""was more fair to Iraqis than the new law, which Mr. al-Hashimi will deal with just like he dealt with the previous one,"" the statement said. Iraq's constitution calls for elections by January 31. Disputes over how seats will be allocated in a new parliament have put the vote in jeopardy. Lawmakers need a two-thirds majority to override a veto, but Iraq's parliament adjourned until December 8 after passing Monday's revised bill. Iraq's top electoral commission -- saying it needs 60 days to prepare for voting -- announced last week that a January vote is unlikely. Al-Hashimi said the election bill is unfair to Iraqis who were forced to flee violence in their homeland, and he refused to sign it without an amendment that would increase the number of seats allocated to refugees and small political parties that could not get enough votes on a national level. In addition to al-Hashimi's objections, Kurdish leaders had threatened to boycott the upcoming vote unless provinces with heavy Kurdish populations get greater representation in the next parliament. The law that parliament passed Monday included revisions the Kurds had sought, but not those al-Hashimi demanded. Al-Hashimi's office said the new law was passed without ""national accordance"" and outside parliament's usual way to deal with ""sensitive national legislation of this caliber."" ""What happened constitutes a dangerous precedent that will negatively overshadow the overall political process,"" the statement said. Asked whether the political holdups in passing a law will mean a delay in the election and troop withdrawals, U.S. Gen. Ray Odierno told CNN Thursday that the withdrawal schedule is not as important as getting a law. ""Their democratic process is working, and I think it's important that they have a law that everyone will accept so we can move forward together -- that's the most important thing. I believe we have enough flexibility we'll be able to mitigate it and we'll be able to go on and have successful elections,"" said Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq.","Laws passed by Iraqi parliament must be approved by president and two vice presidents .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan withstood a brave comeback from Arsenal to advance to the quarterfinals of the Champions League Tuesday despite a 3-0 defeat in the second leg at the Emirates. The Italian champions had led 4-0 from the first leg last month and few bar the most optimistic of Arsenal fans gave Arsene Wenger's men any hope of retrieving the deficit. But first-half goals from Laurent Koscielny, Tomas Rosicky and captain Robin van Persie gave the English Premier League side the perfect platform to complete a remarkable recovery. Koscielny headed home from a corner, Rosicky took advantage of a defensive mistake after a Theo Walcott run and van Persie slotted home a penalty after the excellent Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain was fouled. Milan were all at sea, but regrouped strongly after the break and blunted the Arsenal onslaught. Van Persie uncharacteristically fluffed the best chance for the home side to make it 4-4 on aggregate, but after fine work by Gervinho his effort was saved by Christian Abbiati. ""I felt he wanted to chip the keeper because he was down but Abbiati got up very quickly but he reacted well and unfortunately we couldn't score, Wenger told Sky Sports. ""I hoped in the final 10 or 15 minutes to create some more goal chances, but it didn't happen."" At the other end, Zlatan Ibrahimovic came to life and twice came close to scoring the Milan goal which would have completely killed off the tie. But at the finish it was the Milan players who were celebrating, while Arsenal will be boosted in their challenge for a Champions League spot in the EPL and remain in the FA Cup. In Tuesday's other last 16 tie, Benfica overturned a 3-2 deficit from their first leg against Zenit St Petersburg to win 2-0 in Lisbon and go through 4-3 on aggregate. Maxi Pereira's goal in first-half injury-time set them on their way with Nelson Oliveira secured the outright win in the second minute of added time.","Milan advance 4-3 on aggregate against Arsenal in Champions League .

"(CNN) -- China's Dalian Wanda Group and AMC Entertainment announced Monday a $2.6 billion deal to take over the U.S. theater group, forming the world's largest cinema chain, according to a new release on the deal. The move is the latest in a raft of deals between U.S. entertainment companies and Chinese firms, linking the world's largest theater market with the world's fastest growing. ""This acquisition will help make Wanda a truly global cinema owner, with theatres and technology that enhance the movie-going experience for audiences in the world's two largest movie markets,"" said Wang Jianlin, chairman and president of Wanda. Wanda, a private company that previously operated solely in China, generates $16.7 billion in annual revenue from its commercial development and entertainment businesses, the company said. The group owns 86 theaters with 730 screens in China. ""As the film and exhibition business continues its global expansion, the time has never been more opportune to welcome the enthusiastic support of our new owners,"" said Gerry Lopez, chief executive officer and president of AMC. AMC operates 346 multiplex theaters, largely in North America, with a total of 5,034 screens. Headquarters of AMC, a privately held company, will remain in the Kansas City area and day-to-day operations, including the process for film programming, will remain unchanged, the release said. In a deal last February, China agreed to increase the quota of 20 foreign films per year -- most of them from the U.S. -- to add an additional 14 IMAX or 3D films each year, and nearly doubled the cut foreign film companies can take from Chinese box office to 25%. In April, The Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios and DMG Entertainment of Beijing announced a production deal in which ""Iron Man 3"" will be co-produced in China. That follows the February announced that a $330 million joint venture between DreamWorks Animation, China Media Capital (CMC) and two other Chinese companies to establish a China-focused family entertainment company, Oriental DreamWorks. Last month came revelations, first reported by Reuters, that the Securities and Exchange Commission sent inquiries to 20th Century Fox, Disney and DreamWorks about whether Hollywood studios were paying bribes to get a foothold in the China theater market.","Dalian Wanda Group buys AMC in a $2.6 billion deal for the U.S. theater group .

"(CNN) -- While officials have provided few details about the U.S. Army soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan men, women and children in a house-to-house shooting rampage in two villages, one psychiatrist speculated the incident may have stemmed from mental illness, but not necessarily post-traumatic stress disorder. ""Post-traumatic stress disorder has a cluster of symptoms, and violence, or violence against, others is not usually considered part of that diagnosis,"" said Paul Newhouse, a professor of psychiatry at Vanderbilt University and a former Army psychiatrist. ""So I think it's more likely that we're going to discover that there was some either psychotic illness or delusional condition or some evidence that this person was more seriously deranged or impaired than we would typically see in PTSD."" An Afghan soldier at the combat outpost spotted the staff sergeant leaving about 3 a.m. Sunday and notified American commanders, said Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force. A head count verified the solder was missing, and a search party was assembled, but ""it was as that search party was forming that we began to have indications of the outcome of his departure."" Afghans approached the gate to the outpost, saying there had been a shooting and carrying their wounded, according to a senior Defense Department official. The death toll included nine children, three women and four men. Officials have not identified the suspect or provided many details about him. The suspect ""basically turned himself in and told individuals what had happened,"" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday. However, the Defense Department official said the suspect has invoked his right to remain silent and has given no indication of his motive. The soldier was assigned to the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, according to a congressional source not authorized to speak publicly. He is in his mid-30s, with a wife and children, officials said. An infantry sniper, he was trained to hit to kill at about 800 meters, according to the defense official. He was assigned to an outpost near the southern Afghan city of Kandahar to support a Special Forces unit, according to a military official who asked not to be named because of the pending investigation. He served three tours in Iraq, but this was his first deployment to Afghanistan, Allen said. A U.S. military official said he arrived in Afghanistan in January. During his last deployment in Iraq, in 2010, he was riding in a vehicle that overturned in a crash, and was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury, according to the defense official. However, after treatment he was determined to be fit for duty. Newhouse discounted the possibility that the injury could have played a role in the incident. ""I think that his injury was probably not very significant and thus he was judged to be fit for duty,"" he said. ""I think we're going to learn over the next few weeks or months that this was probably unrelated to this incident."" He also deemed it unlikely that the soldier suffers from a personality disorder. ""A sociopath or a psychopath is somebody who isn't going to fit into the rules of something like the U.S. military, and that kind of person would have been likely drummed out or released from the military many years ago,"" he said. ""I understand this individual was, had been, in the Army for quite some time, so I think a better likelihood is that this person suffered from some severe illness or mental illness that may have come on more recently and perhaps is linked to this terrible incident."" The soldier was put in pretrial confinement in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, about 15 miles from the outpost where he was stationed, said the congressional source. He has not been charged, but Panetta said he could face the death penalty. Military officials have said evidence indicates the suspect acted alone. After the shooting, the suspect's family was moved onto Joint Base Lewis-McChord for their safety, the defense official said. The soldier's medical history will be part of the investigation, which is being handled by U.S. military authorities, Allen said. Newhouse compared the shootings to mass killings seen in the United States, at Virginia Tech and in Tucson, Arizona. Individuals accused in those incidents ""turn out to have given off a lot of signals of mental illness or severe disturbance before the incident, and I think that's where I would be starting my investigation or my inquiry,"" he said. ""I think we are in a new situation for the U.S. Army over the last few years, because we are now having a professional army with multiple deployments, multiple tours in the combat zones, and this is something the Army has really not had a lot of experience with until the last decade or so,"" Newhouse said. In previous engagements, soldiers typically had a single deployment, he said, adding that military officials are attempting to figure out appropriate mental health services for troops after multiple deployments. A handful of soldiers from Joint Base Lewis-McChord have been involved in violent incidents in the past few years, including four soldiers convicted of killing Afghan civilians in 2010 as part of a ""kill squad."" The forensic psychiatric review process at the base's Madigan Army Medical Center is being reviewed. Western Regional Medical Command said last week that some 285 soldiers who were evaluated at Madigan since 2007 will be asked to undergo a second evaluation.

"(EW.com) -- Awww. No offense to high school volleyball player Shannon Magrane (I totally just teared up watching her famous baseball dad's proud-papa reaction to her highlight reel), but I'm glad someone went home last night. After Top 12 contestant Jermaine Jones was disqualified on Wednesday, I thought the whole week might be a wash. Elise Testone and Erika Van Pelt joined Shannon in the bottom three, so they all sat glowering like three icky girls that the stupid, stupid little boys refused to pick for their kickball teams at recess. Don't they know how well those girls can wail? That was a really poor analogy, though, because 1) kickball and recess are pointless, unlike ""American Idol"" which is EVERYTHING, and 2) it's likely the female vote that landed three ladies on the stools of doom in the first place. Please start voting for your sisters, sisters! I know we all have a lot of texting to do, but you can find time to dial in for DeAndre's hair and Elise Testone within the same hour, I promise. Try it! Randy dismissed Shannon immediately following her ""sing for your life"" rehash of ""One Sweet Day"" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men, but earlier in the episode Ryan Seacrest confirmed that the judges will get to use a ""save"" in this season's horse race. Any time from now until the Top 5, our steamy ""Neighwatch"" lifeguards Randy, J. Lo, and Steven can rescue a contestant from the big bad sea of possible elimination. Remember last year, when the judges used their season 10 save on Casey Abrams two weeks before presumed frontrunner Pia Toscano was eliminated? I can see them holding out on this year's get-out-of-jail-free card unless Jessica Sanchez is in danger. I can also see Seacrest instituting a ""Ryan's Save"" out of nowhere so that he could keep his favorite pretty pony Colton Dixon around. God forbid. Oh, how Ryan teases his pretty pony! His attempts to fool Colton into thinking he's in the bottom three have been hilariously bad for three weeks running. This time, Ryan tried to blame Colton's obscure song choice from Wednesday's performance show. ""Unfortunately, my man, that has cost you........... being away from your family this summer, 'cause you're going on the tour!"" Don't ever stop, Ryan. Keep on letting those crawfishy creative juices fly. Hmm, what else? Pretty uneventful show, to be honest. I did appreciate that this week's ridiculous Ford Music Video, which took place in a ""haunted house"" (Ryan could barely get that out without guffawing), could easily have doubled as an ad for Hi-C's Ecto-Cooler. (Products from a Year Well Before Most of the Idols Were Born.) Way to keep the theme of the week going, anyway. Daughtry, who used to have a first name but nope not anymore, showed up all high on life from Tuesday night's hookup with Colton Dixon at the Belmont. He and his band played ""Out of My Head"" from their new album ""Break the Spell."" Right away I felt that Daughtry's keyboardist had a decidedly Uncle Jesse vibe, and then as I unfocused my eyes a little (it's a good way to relax and hear the music better) I started pretending that the lanky guitarist on the left was Adrien Brody. And maybe Daughtry was present-day Joey Lawrence? So all in all it was a fun few minutes for me. For you? Oh, I was also pleasantly surprised by Demi Lovato on her single ""Give Your Heart a Break."" She was just stomping all over that stage, grooving with her guitarists who were very excited to be rocking out on a Demi Lovato song, and pausing at just the right times to bask in the spotlight and dramatically toss around her miles of weave. I thought she sounded great. My vague impressions of Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez had merged over the years into one tiny, sequined, gelatinous blob prior to this. So now that I've confirmed they're two different people, I'm pretty sure I choose this one! Demi truly won my heart with that silver fringed scarf. (""DWTS"" premiere in three days, y'all.) Okay, what are your thoughts on the Top 11 results? Were you surprised that Percy Sledge uses email? Would you award J. Lo's dress a sparkly gold star? It's not like she needs another one!

"Atlanta (CNN) -- On a recent Friday, I stepped into a place I hadn't been in years. ""Oh, wow!"" Shawn Black, my longtime hair stylist, said as I entered the salon. He's been cutting my hair for a decade, but he hadn't seen me in about 26 months. Chuckling at his reaction, I thought back to the dozen times over the previous year that my good friend, Ed, had told me he was going in for a trim and I asked him to assure Shawn I hadn't fired him. I slipped into the black chair and watched in the mirror as Shawn carefully separated my bouffant into about 15 ponytails an inch or two above my scalp. The mildly uncomfortable hair-pulling process was the requisite for Wigs 4 Kids, a charity that manufactures wigs for youngsters with illnesses. Have you donated your hair to charity? Tell us your story . Before I get into how Shawn lopped off 13 inches of my hair, let me explain how I came to acquire the mop atop my head. My mum passed last May. A few months before she bravely marched on, I was visiting her at her Stone Mountain, Georgia, home, where she was essentially bedridden. She noted my hair was getting long. ""I've never seen your curls like this,"" she said, reaching up and taking one of the corkscrews in her fingers. ""It's beautiful. Why have you never grown it out before?"" The answer was simple: Pops would have skewered me. A hippie or woman . My father had died a few years earlier, but he had instilled in me since my teen years that certain things don't belong on boys, long hair among them. Another no-no was earrings. I vividly recall being shamed into removing the one I acquired in high school over spring break in Daytona Beach, Florida. It rested in my lobe for only a week, but pop's constant harassment those seven days -- primarily manifested in accusations that I had turned into a hippie or a woman -- eventually convinced me to extract the cubic zirconia stud. There are only so many times you can hear your father joke, ""I'm heading to the store. You need anything? Skirts? Tampons?"" When mum passed, it had been a while since my last haircut. It was already getting long for my taste. Why I went another year without cutting it, I am not sure. Maybe it was cathartic, or perhaps it was because mum said she liked it. Maybe I was just getting back at dad for making me take out the earring when all the cool kids had one. Hell if I know. I just let it grow, and gravity eventually pulled the corkscrews past my shoulders. Problems ensued, issues I had never faced before. My hair would get caught in things like the recliner and my laptop. If I rested sunglasses on my dome, the curls stubbornly entangled the nosepiece. When eating on patios, the wind would blow the locks into my mouth alongside a forkful of food, an awkward (and kinda gross) sensation to say the least. On vacation in Panama several weeks back, it became too much. The humidity left me drenched. I couldn't cool off. My hair kept falling into my eyes. I emerged from a swim in the ocean looking like Cousin Itt. I tried putting it in a ponytail, something for which I had previously never found cause in life. It provided relief from the heat, but if you put me in a pastel leisure suit I could've doubled for a drug lord on ""Miami Vice."" Not really the look I was going for. The hair had to go. I mentioned this to friends, who had mixed responses. Some had grown accustomed to the shaggy locks; others had been praying I'd get a trim. One suggested I donate my hair. My first reaction: ""Who the hell would want my hair?"" Shorn for a cause . A little research yielded many takers: charities that collect the hair to make wigs for the terminally ill, namely cancer patients whose radiation or chemotherapy treatments had caused their hair to fall out. Sufferers of alopecia and trichotillomania also receive the wigs. Some of the groups crafting hairpieces include Wigs 4 Kids, Wigs For Kids, Angel Hair for Kids, Angel Hair Foundation, Angel Hair Wig Gallery, Pantene Beautiful Lengths, Locks of Love and Children With Hair Loss. I won't purport to have done my journalistic due diligence on which organization is ""the best."" I'm sure they all have merits, despite the lack of diversity in naming them. I chose Wigs 4 Kids because it focuses on children, had great reviews, spends 80% of its budget on programs and its website features a charming before-and-after photo gallery of wig recipients. Their smiles were so much wider in the pictures where they showed off their new hair than in the photos depicting them bald. The resplendent grins reminded me of a charity my pal helps organize here in Atlanta, the Songs for Kids Foundation. The group takes musicians to children's hospitals, not only to play music but also to let the kids join in -- singing, songwriting, strumming axes, banging on drums. The little rock stars are giddy when they get their chance on the mic. Wigs and drums may not seem as important as efforts to, say, find cures to the diseases ailing these youngsters, but until cures are found, there is more to treatment than palliative care. Self-esteem can go a long way in a youngster's fight to survive, providing her/him with the necessary confidence to believe the battle is a winnable one. Innocent as they often may be, kids can be cruel. We're all familiar with the schoolyard clique or bully that picks on the kid who's smaller or different in some way. As Songs for Kids notes, illness can further isolate a child. So while a wig may seem like a small gesture, being able to scamper across a baseball field or twinkle-toe across a dance studio -- without worrying about your hairpiece falling off or your baldness making you an outcast -- that can be an enormous deal. It's a chance to earn acceptance, to show you're a lot like everyone else, no matter what ails you. Most importantly, it's a chance to be a kid when a dastardly disease is doing its best to make you grow old faster than you'd like. Chop and a snip . That's what compelled me to finally call Shawn. I didn't have any Sampsonian connection to my hair so it was a fairly emotionless ordeal, though we both had good laughs as he finished up the ponytailing process. A cup of gin and juice and some melanin, and I would've made a decent Snoop Dogg. Shawn felt it wise to document the look in digital imagery. I was sure the pictures would never see the light of day, but I've found myself sharing them with friends who were all too willing to join me in laughing at myself. Thanks, guys. Shawn finished by carefully scissoring off each ponytail and laying it on a table so it could be prepared for shipping. When he was done, he exclaimed with surprise, ""Did you know these were under here?!"" Thinking I had a rash or perhaps birds nesting in the 'fro, I nervously replied, ""No! What?"" ""These chops,"" he said, laughing. Ahh, yes. I confessed to knowing about the sideburns, though I hadn't given them much thought as they'd been obscured for months. I told him he could go ahead and cut them off. He declined, saying they ""square up"" my face. I still don't know what that means, but I assumed from his tone it's a good thing. In all, it took about 90 minutes to get me seriously streamlined. I got the double-take all last week from co-workers who were surprised to see me show up Monday with a buzzcut and sideburns. Some mocked me, asking if I'd lost a bet or expressing relief I no longer looked like a Muppet. Me, I'm much cooler now, which is important considering the sweltering Atlanta summer is almost upon us. I'm also pleased that my 26-month grooming experiment served some purpose other than catharsis, if that's what it was. I'll even go so far as to thank our weekend homepage editor for convincing me to write in the dreaded first person so we could educate people about donating 'dos to organizations aiming to normalize a few challenging lives. But this will probably (read, most definitely) be my last foray into writing about hair. If you'll excuse me, I'll go back to writing about hard news, sports and hip-hop now.","CNN writer Eliott McLaughlin goes for 2+ years without a haircut .

"(CNN)  -- Around the world, commemorations have taken place this month to mark the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. Rosa Larsen, right, with her mother Reiza and brother Mario, taken in Italy in 1945 after they were reunited. The bloodiest conflict in human history claimed the lives of more than 70 million people -- most of whom were civilians -- and irrevocably shaped the world in which we now live. Institutions and organizations such as the United Nations, NATO and the Geneva Convention were all built from its rubble. Within this narrative, however, there are millions of smaller tales. Fascinating and moving stories passed down within families that tell of the incredible heroism, resilience and honor of ordinary people in unimaginable circumstances. CNN invited iReporters to submit their accounts of their own families' involvement in the conflict. Here we present a selection. --- Reiza Guida, a Jewish girl from South Africa, moved to Italy in 1937 to pursue her studies as a musician, her daughter Rosa Larsen recalls. En route she fell in love with Vincenzo, a young Italian naval officer whom she married a year later. But Reiza's in-laws despised her for being Jewish and offered her no support when Vincenzo drowned off the coast of Taranto after his ship was bombed in March 1942. Read Rosa's iReport about her mother's life. When Nazi officers in the region were passed information of Reiza's Jewish background, she was forced to flee the family home with her young children. ""Alone and bereft, my mother ran for her life, escaping the SS (Gestapo) by a hair-breath each time,"" recalls Rosa, who was just one when war broke out in 1939. ""On one occasion, whilst hiding in a cupboard in a flat owned by a mean 95-year old French woman who was determined to see my mother go to her death with her, the bombs started falling. ""The old woman sat in front of her mirror putting on lipstick, determined not to save herself and refusing to let my mother save herself. Ignoring her stubbornness, my mother dragged her to the underground shelters in spite of the old woman's protestations."" In the meantime, the young Rosa and her brother Mario hid in the countryside with their Italian aunt. ""Here too, we had some very narrow escapes,"" recalls Rosa, ""and my brother and I vividly remember a Nazi officer going from house to house looking for Jews and the two of us hiding and shivering below the boards under the big feather-bed."" The two siblings were separated shortly after -- packed off to Catholic convents where they were subjected to ""exceptional cruelty"" by the nuns and priests. Reiza -- who had fluent command of seven languages -- repeatedly evaded capture by the Gestapo and, when the Allies reached Italy, was appointed by British officers to the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), organizing entertainment for Allied troops in Genova and Udine.  With help from British intelligence, Rosa says, she and Mario were reunited with their mother and lived at the large villa from which Reiza hosted ENSA events. Reiza, who died in 1999, eventually moved to South Africa and remarried.  Rosa, now a grandmother, lives in Perth, Australia with husband Peter, whose grandmother and aunt were murdered by the Nazis in Pinsk, Belarus in 1942. --- Michael Rutkowski, from Manhattan, New York City, told iReport how his grandfather, Polish count Alojzy Wojcinski, formed an unusual alliance with a German nobleman he believes was called Baron von Puglis. He recalled how, during WWII his grandfather was an officer in the Home Army, the Polish resistance movement. The baron colluded with the count to undermine the Nazi presence in Warsaw, Michael says, despite being an officer in the Wehrmacht, the German army. Read Michael's iReport about his grandfather . ""Both of them would go outside Warsaw to pick up gold dropped by the British planes at night and go through all the checkpoints to Marszalkowska Street where they would distribute all the gold to other Home Army members,"" Michael says. According to Michael, the baron's defection was probably motivated by his marriage to Wojcinki's sister, or the fact that he just ""hated Nazis."" Michael says that towards the end of the war his grandfather was captured and sent to a German prison camp from which he later escaped. The baron was killed by a bomb during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, says Michael, who was told the family history by his late grandmother (""I'm kicking myself for not recording it because here WWII stories were terrific"") and is keen to track down more details on just who the German nobleman was. --- Jon Mankowski of Portland, Oregon explains how his mother, Christine Mankowski, found her way to America after fleeing from Eastern Europe. ""On September 1, 1939 she was celebrating her 13th birthday when she heard the Nazi bombers flying over the city of Warsaw,"" says Jon of the day that Germany started the war in Europe. Read Jon's iReport about his mother . ""Within weeks she and her family were picked up for distribution to various forced labor camps around Eastern Europe. Somehow she and two of her sisters and mother made it here after the war.""  Christine, who died in 2007, eventually reached America, at one point working at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber company in Los Angeles. --- Alexander Breuer, a 13-year old Austrian Jew who fled to America in January 1940 with his parents and brother, was among the first liberators into the notorious Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany, his daughter Heddy Abramowitz explains. Alexander had to wait until he was 18 before he could be drafted into the U.S. Army and was sent, as a German speaker, to help negotiate the surrender of the town of Weimar. Read Heddy's iReport about her father . It was during these negotiations, Breuer told the 1981 International Liberators Conference, that local officials alerted Allied officers to the nearby Buchenwald concentration camp. ""As I understand it, this was the first U.S Jeep into any concentration camp in Europe,"" says Heddy, who now lives in Jerusalem. Alexander, who died in 1983, went on to marry Heddy's mother, Lee Feig Breuer, a Holocaust survivor from Romania. Heddy recalls that Lee's one surviving brother from the death camps, Eliezer Feig, volunteered to fight in Israel's War of Independence in 1948 and was killed in the Battle of Yafo at the age of 17. ""I am just skimming over the lives of these people, which were very full,"" Heddy says. ""They all lived before the internet, and never sought self-promotion. Their deeds speak louder."" -- George Webster contributed to this report .","iReporters tell of World War II family experiences and how it shaped their lives .

"(CNN) -- A Florida State University student has died while studying abroad in China, a school spokeswoman said Monday. Local law enforcement authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of William Cullen Klein, said Jeanette DeDiemar, the Tallahassee school's director of university communications. Neither DeDiemar or the Tallahassee-based university itself offered any details regarding Klein's death. At the time, he was with 36 other students in Tianjin, a large city about 140 kilometers (85 miles) southeast of Beijing, as part of the university's international studies program -- an interdepartmental endeavor through which students can earn bachelor's or master's degrees in international affairs, Asian studies or Russian and East European studies. According to DeDiemar, the group left for China on May 5 and were scheduled to return on June 17. Klein was majoring in Chinese language and culture, as well as Spanish, the Florida State spokeswoman said. On his Facebook page, in which his name is written in English as well as Chinese, Klein said that he knew 28 languages and dialects -- from Haitian Creole to Egyptian Arabic to Mandarin Chinese. His Facebook timeline notes some considerable travel in the past two years, including to Ireland, Spain and Morocco. DeDiemar said that Klein is from Melbourne Beach, Florida, on the state's Atlantic coast, and his Facebook page notes he is a graduate of Melbourne High School.","William Cullen Klein was with 36 other Florida State students in China .

"(CNN) -- A member of the Dutch royal family was severely injured in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort Friday, local authorities told CNN. Prince Johan Friso, 43, a son of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, was skiing outside the bounds of the ski resort with friends at the resort of Lech am Arlberg when he was hit by an avalanche, a spokesman for the state of Vorarlberg said. No one else in the group was affected, the spokesman said. The prince was under the snow for a ""short period of time,"" the spokesman said. He was wearing an electronic beacon that helped rescuers quickly find him, he said. The prince was airlifted to a hospital in Innsbruck, where he is in intensive care, authorities said. Doctors described the prince as stable but not out of danger, according to a statement from the queen. Lech am Arlberg is in Austria's Vorarlberg state, a popular skiing area in western Austria. The region's avalanche agency reported there was a considerable to great chance of avalanches in Lech on Friday. It cited new snowfall on top of a packed layer of snow that could cause snow slabs to slide off. The prince gave up his right to the throne when he married in 2004 without Parliament's permission. He and his wife live in London with their two daughters. CNN's Francesca Church contributed to this report.","Doctors say he is stable but not out of danger .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Whitney Houston's mother and daughter attended an emotional private viewing Friday, hours ahead of the pop singer's funeral in Newark, New Jersey. Cissy Houston and Bobbi Christina Brown were joined at the funeral home by music producer Clive Davis, credited with discovering a young Whitney Houston in the early 1980s. Flags in the state flew at half-staff Friday to honor Houston, 48, a New Jersey native. She died February 11 in Beverly Hills, California. Actor Kevin Costner, who starred with Houston in the 1992 hit movie ""The Bodyguard,"" will speak at the invitation-only service Saturday at New Hope Baptist Church, according to a source with knowledge of the funeral plans. The ceremony will feature performances by Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys and close family friend Aretha Franklin, a Houston representative said. Houston's former husband, Bobby Brown, and singer Roberta Flack also are expected to attend. Franklin, in concert Friday night at Radio City Music Hall in New York, told the audience, ""It is my sincere hope to sing something to uplift our heavy hearts this evening."" Among her selections were ""Jesus Loves Me"" and ""Amazing Grace."" ""We will always remember her kindness, her grace, her smile and her dynamic performances, but she's moved on up just a little bit higher now and we don't wonder where she is,"" said Franklin. Houston's close friend, reality TV star and singer Ray J, released his first statement about her death, saying he feels an ""emptiness"" at her loss. ""What my heart feels cannot be expressed in words,"" said Ray J, who was Houston's frequent companion in the days before she died. ""The world lost an icon, but I lost my close friend. Nippy, I miss you so much! You were so happy and full of love. Your smile will live in my heart forever."" Friday night's 43rd annual NAACP Image Awards, broadcast on NBC, featured a video and musical tribute to Houston. Gospel singer Yolanda Adams, backed by a small choir, sang ""I Love the Lord,"" which appeared on the soundtrack of ""The Preacher's Wife,"" a 1996 film that starred Houston. The show ended with Kirk Franklin and others singing ""The Greatest Love of All."" Meanwhile, investigators seeking answers about how the singer died were contacting doctors and pharmacies across the country for information on her prescription drug use. They are trying to determine whether it played a role in Houston's death. Houston's death certificate is only fueling speculation about her death. It lists the cause as ""deferred,"" meaning a determination is delayed pending more information. The investigation is also looking into the superstar's behavior in her last days. Investigators are aware that Houston partied at her hotel and other venues ""even the night before she died,"" a source close to the death investigation told CNN. Personnel at the Beverly Hilton have said Houston was partying in the bar the night before her death, the source said. A second source said Houston appeared intoxicated as she ordered drinks in the hotel earlier in the week and that she was seen drinking the morning of the day she died. Key moments in Whitney Houston's life . Investigators are looking at video from Houston's television appearances and at other reports as part of the investigation into her physical state and behavior leading up to her death on the eve of the Grammy Awards, the first source said. Hotel surveillance video, if it exists, could reveal Houston's activities in the common areas of the hotel, the source said. The anti-anxiety medication Xanax was among prescription drugs found in the singer's room, the source said. Houston's family members and staff confirmed she used the medication, the source said, but investigators don't know whether she took it the day she died. Xanax is a drug classified as a benzodiazepine, or sedative, but no other benzodiazepines, including Valium, were found in the room, according to the source. Houston also had a prescription for the antibiotic amoxicillin, the source said, but ""if taken as prescribed, it's not going to kill you."" Medicine and pill bottles found in Houston's hotel room are currently undergoing basic testing, but nothing so far indicates anything criminal occurred, the source said. Officials are trying to speed up toxicology testing, the source told CNN. The source called speculation any preliminary reporting about family members being told that a deadly mixture of alcohol and drugs led to Houston's death. Investigators do not know what mixture, if any Houston, had in her body. Ed Winter, assistant chief coroner at the Los Angeles County coroner's office, has said that while prescription medication was found in Houston's room, the amount was less than that usually present in overdose deaths. ""I know there are reports that she maybe was drowned or did she overdose, but we won't make a final determination until all the tests are in,"" Winter said shortly after her death was reported. He ruled out foul play and said there were no injuries to Houston's body. Houston's battles with drug addiction had cast a shadow in recent years over her impressive singing voice and her talent. However, a close family friend told CNN on Tuesday that Houston had not used ""hard drugs"" for several years, although she was taking medication for a throat infection and Xanax or a similar drug for anxiety and to help her sleep. The friend said Houston was also known to have a drink if she went out. Never-seen photos of a young Houston .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Along with his band The Stooges, Iggy Pop invented punk rock and his outrageous onstage antics have inspired countless wannabes. After years of excess, the 'Godfather of Punk' moved to Miami in search of peace. CNN's travel show My City, My Life caught up with him to talk about music, inspiration and life in his favorite city Miami. Iggy Pop: ""Don't look now but that guy is going to try and carjack your rental car!"" CNN: What made you move to Miami? Iggy Pop: I was fed up after 25 years in huge, dark, media-centric cities. I decided to find a house and move here. I was looking for something in a kind of elegant coma with a lot of peace and convenience. CNN: Is Miami similar to you as a person? IP: Miami is nothing like me and that's why I need to be here -- it's the opposite. I'm practical, where this place is moody, I'm stolid in my interior where this place has a certain flair and I'm materialistic in a sense that this place is fundamentally spiritual -- there's a quicksilver quality about this place. CNN: How would you describe Miami's personality? IP: Miami's a hell of a good town to eat a banana! CNN: What do you do when you need writing inspiration for your music? IP: I need to feel good. When I was 20, 21 years old, it meant three or four joints and then went from there. Now, I usually get it after exercise or from nature, sometimes from a woman or a city. I get it from a good song or a great book. Something I like to do a lot is just sit by water when there's a current and just stare into the water. I don't fish, I don't hunt, I don't scuba, I don't spear, don't boat, don't play basketball or football -- I excel at staring into space. I'm really good at that. It helps the writing a little bit, the kind of writing that works for music, which is tiny writing. It's not like writing a novel -- it's all about making your point small. CNN: What do you most love about Miami? IP: I love what was here before any of the people - the puffy clouds, the forgiving quality of the light, the breeze that renews life and hints at freedom, and the sea. It's somewhere you can look out and just see things stop. Second only to the sea the Miami sky has been the greatest comfort in my life past 50. On a good day, when the wind blows from the south, the light here is diffuse and forgiving.  See photos of Iggy in Miami. » . CNN: If you were an estate agent, how would you sell Miami? IP: I'd say: ""you've done your time up north, you've got your medal; now come down to Miami and heal yourself."" CNN: If you were trying to put people off Miami, what would you tell them? IP: I'd say: ""Don't look now but that guy is going to try and carjack your rental car!"" CNN: Is Miami a poor cousin to New York or LA? IP: Miami's not anybody's poor cousin. It's an aspiration to live in this town, not something you have to do to promote yourself like some of the larger cities. CNN: What's the stereotype of Miami and is it correct? IP: It's changing rapidly but, more than anything else, it has always been associated with retirement and indolence in equal proportions. Miami's reputation is probably a little low brow, which is changing. CNN: How have the changes in Miami affected you? IP: Miami is growing and that's always a tricky proposition. Basically, I'm one of those characters who like to lurk where not too many people are, so the effect on me has been to push me bit by bit like an Indian tribe, closer and closer to the edges of town, which is fine. CNN: How has Miami influenced you as an artist? IP: Miami has given me 11 very good years now and has prolonged my abilities and energies, and provoked my good humor enough that I could continue in my field. But it's not a place to come to get an idea. Come here to catch a fish! CNN: What is the music like in Miami? IP: It's a very musical town and it's full of some of the best musicians you'll find anywhere in any genre -- soul, Latin, pop, salsa. There are some damn good rock players down here. There are a lot of good little punk bands here -- little punkers with good little attitudes. It's a very musical place and I kind of like that it puts rock and roll in perspective. It's not the biggest or only thing here and I don't think it ever should have been. CNN: If Miami was a person, who would it be? IP: It would be Rudolf Valentino, because it's dark and moody, with a brilliant and sensual side, and it captures and inflames the imagination of a great deal of the western world. CNN: How would you describe Miami in one sentence? IP: Miami's a sunny place for shady people!","Iggy Pop says he moved to Miami in search of peace and convenience .

Portland Police Chief Michael Sauschuck confirmed Tuesday that a body pulled from Portland Harbor in the city's Old Port area is that of 31-year-old Nathan Bihlmaier. ""It's a tragic end. We had high hopes throughout working with the family and the community to bring Nate home. These weren't the circumstances that we wanted,"" Sauschuck told reporters. He said there's no indication of foul play, but investigators are working to piece together Bihlmaier's final hours using security camera video from nearby businesses. Cops: Body of missing girl, 19, found in woods . Bihlmaier and two friends drove from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Portland last weekend to celebrate his graduation from Harvard. According to police reports, Bihlmaier was asked to leave the Ri Ra Irish pub on Commercial Street around 12:20 a.m. Sunday because he was visibly intoxicated. He left alone but never returned to his hotel, prompting his friends to report him missing, police said. Arrest made in missing California teen case . For two days, police divers, using side-scan sonar, searched Portland Harbor for the missing man. On Monday, authorities announced that divers had found Bihlmaier's clothing. Bihlmaier's wife, Nancy, who is pregnant with their first child, traveled to Portland to help police in their search efforts. ""It's a day that will now be forever tinged with sadness,"" Nitin Nohria, dean of Harvard Business School, told reporters after learning Bihlmaier's body had been found. Nohria also said this week's commencement activities will be bittersweet as Bihlmaier's classmates mourn. ""We're a tight-knit community preparing for a graduation. Nathan was supposed to be one of 900 receiving a diploma. We were all hoping this would be a day Nathan could celebrate. Instead, we are here trying to grasp this unspeakable tragedy,"" Nohria said.

"(CNN) -- When the roaring stopped, when the debris stopped whirling and the glass stopped breaking, the 4-foot wooden cross remained on the wall. It was a fixture in the emergency department waiting room of St. John's Mercy Hospital in Joplin, Missouri, a symbol of the hospital's Catholic roots and, perhaps, a comfort to the sick and injured who sought help there. And after St. John's took a direct hit from a catastrophic tornado May 22, it became a symbol of something else: Joplin's resilience, the strength and compassion of its people and their determination to rebuild. On Sunday, the cross will be loaded onto a truck bed and will lead the way from the old hospital to the site of a new facility during a dual demolition-groundbreaking ceremony. Demolition of the old hospital building -- a reminder of the tragedy -- will begin, and ground will be broken for a new building as Joplin moves forward. ""It's hard to say goodbye to the building that has been St. John's since 1968,"" said Gary Pulsipher, president of St. John's Mercy, in a statement. The hospital has occupied three different sites in Joplin since 1896. ""But like the rest of the city, we are glad to be moving ahead and looking to the future. While we will never forget what happened here, taking down the hospital is another step in the process of removing the visible signs of the tornado's devastation from the landscape,"" Pulsipher said. ""As I drive by it, like everyone else, it reminds me of that horrible night that lives were changed in our community,"" said Gary Shaw, a Joplin city councilman. But, he said, the building is also ""a testimony"" to the past eight months ""and how strong people have been, and how they've pulled together."" ""A lot of cleanup has been done, a lot of rebuilding is going on,"" Shaw said. But ""people are still somewhat confused, and they're going through, I think, a time of 'This happened. What do I do now?' I think that's kind of where we are now. We're trying to get over the shock of all of it."" The final death toll from the tornado was 161 -- including five patients and one visitor at St. John's. More than 1,000 people were injured. The Joplin twister was the deadliest on U.S. soil since the National Weather Service began keeping records in 1950. It was classified as an EF-5, the highest ranking on the scale used to measure tornado intensity, with winds of more than 200 mph. Inside St. John's, on the corner of 26th and McClelland Boulevard in the southwestern part of the city, patients were watching television, resting, eating dinner or receiving visitors that Sunday evening when the twister slammed into the nine-story building about 5:40 p.m. Windows were blown out. Cars were hurled in the parking lot like toys, piled near the emergency room entrance. Gurneys were thrown blocks away. In parts of the hospital parking lot and in a parking lot just to the west, 200- to 300-pound concrete parking stops, fastened into the asphalt with rebar, were lifted and tossed up to 180 feet, the weather service said. The hospital's helicopter lay crumpled, some distance away from its pad. X-rays from St. John's were found in driveways in Dade County, Missouri, about 70 miles away. The building looked as if it had been bombed. ""The houses are all gone,"" Sara Ferguson, who was near the hospital when the storm struck, told The Joplin Globe newspaper at the time. ""The medical buildings are gone. (The hospital) windows have all been blown out. It was horrible. I couldn't even take pictures on my phone. I was crying."" The hospital was very nearly the only structure in the immediate area left standing, albeit severely damaged. Hospital officials swung into action almost immediately. About 183 patients and 200 staffers were evacuated from the building. Triage centers were set up outside. Other hospitals in the area opened their doors for St. John's patients and others who had been injured. Doctors and nurses rushed to the scene. ""Within a matter of hours, we had almost more help than we could put to use,"" Dr. Jim Roscoe told CNN at the time. ""I just can't begin to tell you, we've had people coming from several hundreds of miles away, grabbing their stethoscope and anything they could get, and threw it in the car and came."" Across Joplin, people were also pulling together. The injured were transported to hospitals on doors in the back of pickup trucks. Businesses loaded trucks with donations. Restaurants helped provide food to those in need. ""You have shown the world what it means to love thy neighbor,"" President Barack Obama told the people of Joplin at a memorial service for the victims a week after the tornado. ""You've banded together ... you've demonstrated a simple truth: that amid heartbreak and tragedy, no one is a stranger."" That same day, St. John's was beginning to see patients in a tent facility set up across the parking lot. Built to withstand 100-mph winds, the facility had an emergency department, surgical suites, MRI and CT scan capabilities, a pharmacy and 60 inpatient beds, the hospital said. ""The building is not St. John's,"" Dr. Bob Dodson, who worked to set up the temporary facility, said at the time. ""St. John's is the people who worked in that building. And they're going to be the people in this building."" A modular hospital has since taken the place of the tent, said St. John's spokeswoman Miranda Lewis, and a more permanent structure was built nearby. The structure can be moved, and can be used to upgrade other facilities after St. John's moves into its new home, she said. In the days after the tornado, Mercy was ""a blessing,"" Shaw said. They continued paying their employees, he said, and set up the temporary facilities. ""You have to admire that they didn't let it defeat them."" In all, five buildings across 47 acres at the hospital site will be demolished and cleared, according to a statement from Mercy, St. John's parent company. Its facility is by far the largest, at about 750,000 square feet. Three medical offices and a rehabilitation facility will also be torn down. Typically, a building so large would be imploded. But underground lead mines made that an impossibility for St. John's. ""Joplin traces its roots back to the early miners who settled here in the late 1800s,"" said Dan O'Connor, the demolition project manager, in the statement. ""As is the case in many places throughout the city, those mines were filled in to make way for growth. While they can be made safe to build on, we don't want to take any chances that demolition charges and crashing debris could create an uplift pressure that might cause damage to surrounding properties."" Instead, a wrecking ball will demolish the hospital's west tower, and grappling equipment will be used to take down the east tower. The demolition process should take about six weeks, officials said. But before it began, crews searched the hospital for anything in good condition -- Bibles, artwork, memorial plaques, stained glass and marble. Teams began cleaning out and salvaging in December, the hospital said. Three time capsules were recovered -- one buried when the current hospital was built in 1968, one when the east tower was completed in the 1980s and a third that marked St. John's 100th anniversary in Joplin in 1996. And, of course, the cross. ""The cross certainly has some scars on it,"" said Terry Wachter, vice president of mission for St. John's, in the statement. ""But they just add character."" Many of the items recovered will either be relocated to the new hospital or placed in a tornado memorial museum, she said. Other pieces -- plastic piping from the sprinkler system, windows -- will be studied and tested to see how they weathered the storm. Meanwhile, officials are making efforts to limit the amount of debris that winds up in landfills from the demolition. Steel, aluminum and copper from the buildings is being salvaged and recycled, hospital officials said. Concrete and asphalt will be crushed into small pieces and used as backfill to ready the site for redevelopment. ""The devastation from the tornado was bad enough,"" said John Farnen, executive director of planning, design and construction for Mercy. ""We really want to take all the measures possible to care for this site throughout the demolition process."" Before the hospital comes down on Sunday, a demolition ceremony will be held on the hospital campus, part of several events designed to help Joplin ""say goodbye to the past and celebrate the future,"" Mercy said. The Missouri Highway Patrol will transport the cross to the new hospital site, located about 2 1/2 miles away at Interstate 44 and Main Street. A groundbreaking ceremony will be held there, ""a celebration of Mercy's future and the rebuilding of Joplin,"" according to Mercy. Mercy has invested nearly $1 billion to help rebuild Joplin's health care complex, according to its website. ""Though the tornado took our hospital, it did not destroy our spirit,"" the site says. ""Mercy is rising again in Joplin."" After the buildings are torn down, the land will be readied for development by Mercy. Twelve acres have been donated to the Joplin school district for a new elementary school that will replace two schools destroyed by the tornado; construction is set to begin in May. Options for the other acreage are being considered, Mercy said. Ideas under consideration include a memorial museum, a courtyard and a memorial garden. ""The future is just so bright,"" Shaw said, as Joplin's new hospital will be ""one of the most up-to-date facilities in the country."" Asked what the ceremonies might mean to Joplin residents, he said, ""Maybe the word is 'hope.'"" ""To me, you can dwell on all the debris, or you can think about what's going to rise up out of the debris,"" Shaw said. ""I kind of have a tendency to want to concentrate on the future.""","St. John's Mercy Hospital took a near-direct hit from an EF-5 tornado in May .

"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- Dominican lawmaker Danilo Medina declared victory in the nation's presidential elections in a series of Twitter posts Monday, but his closest competitor has yet to concede. ""Today, thanks to the sovereign decision of the Dominican people, I am the president of all Dominicans,"" Medina wrote. He led with 51% of the vote, with 99% of votes counted in the election authority's preliminary tally of Sunday's election results. His closest competitor, former President Hipolito Mejia, had not conceded as of Monday night. The preliminary tally gave him 47% of votes. A candidate must garner 50% of the vote plus 1 to avoid a second round of voting. In an interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Monday, Medina vowed to address drug trafficking, education and incomes in a country where more than one-third of the population lives in poverty. He said he would work toward creating conditions such that young people have opportunities to pursue other than crime. ""I want to build a middle-class society. That is my main goal -- to have a population that is able to go shopping, to have the capacity to consume,"" he said. The election is a rematch of the nation's 2000 presidential contest, where Mejia defeated Medina. Since the end of Mejia's term in 2004, the presidency has been held by Leonel Fernandez, of the centrist Dominican Liberation Party, the same party that Medina belongs to. Mejia represents the left-leaning Dominican Revolutionary Party. Some see the candidates as similar in some respects, but passions nonetheless on both sides are strong. ""The truth is that in the Dominican Republic, I would say the national pastime is not baseball. The national sport is politics,"" said Mauricio De Vegoechea, a political analyst. The boisterous campaigns stretched from the island to New York, where there is a large population of Dominicans. Ahead of Sunday's vote, some 200 foreign electoral observers were in the country, and 60,000 police and troops were deployed for security. ""The big difference, obviously, is that one of these candidates was already president and showed us who he was, and the other candidate has certainly been close to the government, but has never held the executive position and is known as a very qualified official,"" said Javier Cabreja, president of the civic group Citizens' Participation. Mejia, 71, the former president, has a background in agriculture. He served a previous administration as minister of agriculture and became involved in politics at an early age. Medina, 60, was elected to four-year terms as a lawmaker in 1986, 1990 and 1994. He also served as president of the country's House of Representatives. He twice served as secretary of state. There are more than 6 million registered voters in the country. CNN's Camilo Egana and Maria Santana contributed to this report.","NEW: His closest competitor has not conceded the election .

"(CNN) -- Gary Vincent Giordano, who last year was held in Aruba for nearly four months as authorities investigated the disappearance of a woman traveling with him, has been charged with indecent exposure along with a woman after police found them unclothed in the back of a Cadillac Escalade, police in Maryland said Tuesday. Carol Ann Bock, 45, of Springfield, Tennessee, was also charged with indecent exposure after police saw her left breast exposed in plain sight while she was lying in the rear cargo area of the black 2005 Escalade sport utility vehicle with Giordano, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, according to an Annapolis Police Department report. The SUV was parked on the second level of the Noah Hillman parking garage in the Annapolis historic district, and police received a report of possible sexual activity inside a vehicle at the garage, the report said. The incident occurred late Friday afternoon, police said. ""While we recognize that Mr. Giordano enjoys an infamous reputation, the Annapolis arrest was simply a matter of effective police work in response to citizen complaints,"" Annapolis Chief Michael Pristoop said. ""Officers took quick and appropriate action under the circumstances. Indecent exposure and other offensive conduct are intolerable."" Two passers-by complained to a garage employee about the SUV, and when the employee located the vehicle, he observed a woman and man cuddled together, with the man not wearing any clothes, the report said. Police found the couple partially covered by a blanket and lying on a single mattress in the back of the SUV, and one officer shined his light into the vehicle to gain the couple's attention, the report said. Bock ""pulled the sheet up to her neck,"" and Giordano adjusted a towel over his midsection, but the other officer eventually ""could see that Mr. Giordano was completely nude,"" the report said. ""Ms. Bock was instructed to put her clothing on and exit the vehicle,"" the report said. In Aruba last year, Giordano had been held in the disappearance of 35-year-old Robyn Gardner of Maryland. Giordano told authorities the two were snorkeling on August 2 when he signaled to Gardner to swim back. When he reached the beach, he told police, Gardner was nowhere to be found and has not been seen since. Aruban prosecutor Taco Stein said last year that he was aware Giordano was going to return home after being freed. ""If we need him again, we will seek extradition with the United States,"" he said. Giordano took out a $1.5 million life insurance policy on Gardner days before they traveled to Aruba. On ABC's ""Good Morning America"" last year, he said he purchased travel cancellation insurance on a website and also purchased medical, dental and accident insurance on both him and Gardner. Because both people were listed on the cancellation policy, the site automatically assigned Gardner the other insurance, he said. ""You can't unselect anybody."" He said he routinely purchases such insurance when traveling. ""I have children,"" he said. ""I have a house ... I maxed out on everything ... I was selecting it for me and she got the same thing."" Giordano acknowledged he inquired about the policy two days after Gardner disappeared but said he was told by his then-attorney Michael Lopez to do so. Lopez told him that he could be billed for helicopters and scuba divers used to search for Gardner, he said. He told ""Good Morning America"" that a travel handbook issued by the Dutch government advises travelers, in the case of a missing person, to call authorities and then call their insurance company. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Gary Vincent Giordano, 51, and a woman are charged with indecent exposure in Maryland .

"(CNN) -- I came to America as a transfer student in the fall of 2004. I did three years of computer engineering in India and then transferred to Purdue University Calumet. On July 2, 2005, just a month before graduation, a guy who lived on the first floor of my apartment building set fire to his place. He wrapped his baby in a blanket, put the baby in a car seat, put the car seat in the closet and then poured gasoline over the apartment with his baby and wife still in it. He then set the whole place on fire and left. The fire started at 4:30 a.m. My roommate and I could not jump out with the balcony and windows engulfed in flames. As my roommate fell unconscious in front of me, I started running down the stairs and passed out. A firefighter found my body and pulled me out. As the paramedics were taking me to the hospital, I heard one say, ""This guy is 95% burned; he doesn't have a chance."" At that moment, I thought about my family and how I came to America to get good education, and now I didn't have a chance to live. I was soon unconscious and later woke up in the University of Chicago burn unit after four months in an induced coma. The man's wife, his baby and my best friend and roommate, Prabhat Singhal, died in the fire. After seven months in Chicago, I was transferred to Wishard Health Services in Indianapolis for my rehabilitation. I don't have any family in America so I lived in a nursing home. I stayed there for 2Â½ years while I went through reconstructive surgeries to regain range of motion in my arms. For more than five years, I went through an intense therapy program. I wore a face mask for three years and pressure garments on my entire body; I wore dynamic splints on my hands, wrists and elbows to increase range of motion, daily dressing changes to my wounds and performing hourly exercises to restore function in all of my joints. I wanted to get an MBA so I studied in my extra time. I scheduled my Graduate Management Admission Test, or GMAT, exam and got a six-hour pass from the nursing home to take the test. I scored 700 on my GMAT and got accepted into the Indiana University Kelley School of Business Evening MBA program in Indianapolis. I wanted to go to a part-time program since I didn't know how much of a course load I would be able to take. Everyone gets their acceptance letter mailed to his home; I got my letter mailed to the nursing home. My doctors did everything they could to help me regain range of motion in my arms. Even after 54 surgeries, I am still very limited. I don't have any finger movement in my left hand and very limited finger movement in my right hand. I type with one finger. I rely on various adaptive equipments to perform my activities of daily living. This horrific crime not only left me with disabilities but also interfered with my visa. I have not seen most of my family in India since the accident seven years ago, because I am still waiting on a green card. My sister has been denied a visa four times in trying to visit me. I have been able to come out of this tragedy because of the values that my parents instilled in me and the help from my occupational therapist. My parents taught me the value of education, hard work and perseverance. They taught me to be content in life no matter what the circumstances. They taught me that ""we can always find someone who is in worse condition than we are in. So be thankful for what you have."" I call my occupational therapist, Shannon Hendricks, my guardian angel. God sent her into my life when I was in the deepest and darkest pit of my life. She took me to church every Sunday while I stayed in the nursing home, which brought some normalcy into my life. Today, I can live independently because of her hard work. After 3Â½ years, I graduated with my MBA on May 13. I am now seeking a job in finance. To give back to the community, I volunteered in the Wishard therapy department between many of my surgeries. I still visit the Wishard burn unit and talk to other burn patients about my experience. I also lecture at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis to occupational therapy students about all the adaptive equipment I use to live independently. I have had some wonderful people in my life who have helped me in my journey. I plan to do the same for other people.","Manoj Rana, a native of India, nearly died in an apartment fire after coming to study in the U.S.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Monday that he has signed an executive order allowing new sanctions against companies that enable Syria and Iran to use technology such as cell phone monitoring to carry out human rights abuses. The order is part of a broader strategy intended to strengthen the administration's ability to prevent atrocities, including creation of an Atrocities Prevention Board, Obama said in somber remarks at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day. ""These technologies should be in place to empower citizens, not to repress them,"" Obama said of the measure, which targets the Syrian and Iranian governments, as well as companies that provide them with high-tech equipment to use against their own people. A White House statement said the executive order signed Sunday ""authorizes sanctions and visa bans against those who commit or facilitate grave human rights abuses via information technology ... related to Syrian and Iranian regime brutality."" ""This novel sanctions tool allows us to sanction not just those oppressive governments, but the companies that enable them with technology they use for oppression and the 'digital guns for hire' who create or operate systems used to monitor, track, and target citizens for killing, torture, or other grave abuses,"" the White House statement said. Obama said the new Atrocities Prevention Board will meet for the first time on Monday at the White House. It will have members from several government departments, including State, Defense, Treasury, Justice and Homeland Security, as well as other agencies, to help the United States improve its ability to identify and respond more quickly to threats of atrocities, according to the White House statement. ""Across government, alert channels will make sure that information about unfolding crises and dissenting opinions reach decision-makers, including me,"" Obama said. Other steps include what Obama called the first-ever intelligence assessment on the risk of mass atrocities and genocide, saying the goal is to ""institutionalize the focus on this issue."" ""Our Treasury Department will work more quickly to deploy its financial tools to block the flow of money to abusive regimes,"" the president said. ""Our military will take additional steps to incorporate the prevention of atrocities into its doctrine and its planning. The State Department will surge our diplomats and experts in a crisis."" He received applause from the audience of Holocaust survivors and others when he said, in clear reference to the situation in Syria, that ""national sovereignty is never a license to slaughter your people."" Obama has come under heavy criticism on foreign policy issues recently from Republicans, including his certain opponent in the November election, Mitt Romney, and the president's comments appeared aimed at defending a range of acts by his administration that he said saved ""countless lives"" around the world. Calling the prevention of atrocities and genocide a ""core national security interest"" as well as a core American value, Obama added: ""That does not mean that we intervene militarily every time there is an atrocity committed. We cannot and should not."" Instead, he cited a growing range of tools available and referred to specific achievements such as creation of the world's newest nation of South Sudan as part of a treaty that ended decades of war, resolution of a leadership crisis in Ivory Coast and the resolution of the Libyan crisis. Obama also announced that he is extending the work of American advisers in Uganda helping pursue the Lord's Resistance Army and its leader, Joseph Kony, who are accused of widespread atrocities. ""Today I can announce that our advisers will continue their efforts to bring this madman to justice and to save lives,"" Obama said. Monday's visit to the Holocaust memorial museum was Obama's first as president. He was accompanied by Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor, who urged Obama and world leaders to prevent atrocities such as attacks on citizens occurring in Syria. In particular, Wiesel said threats by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to use nuclear weapons to destroy Israel must be confronted. ""How is it that the Holocaust number one denier -- Ahmadinejad -- is still a president,"" Wiesel said in introducing Obama. ""He who threatens to use nuclear weapons ... to destroy the Jewish state. Have we not learned? We must know that when evil has power, it is almost too late."" In his remarks, Obama repeated his administration's policy on the issue, saying: ""The United States will do everything in our power to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon."" The president has come under criticism from Republicans and some pro-Israel groups for not taking stronger steps to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Israel has made clear it is considering a military strike on Iran's nuclear energy facilities. The Obama administration argues it has worked with international partners to strengthen sanctions against Iran, and more time is needed for those steps to weaken the Iranian economy and influence the regime's behavior. Romney, in a speech earlier this year to the pro-Israel group AIPAC, excoriated the administration's ""policy of engagement with Iran,"" but erroneously asserted the president had opposed sanctions against Iran at that point. Supporters of the administration were quick to point out that the most crippling set of sanctions against Iran since initial legislation was passed in the late 1990s occurred under Obama's watch. In his remarks Monday, Obama also announced that he will award the nation's highest civilian honor -- the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- to the late Jan Karski, a resistance figure who tried to alert the world to the Holocaust atrocities during World War II.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Squads of local government enforcers are operating in Chinese cities without proper supervision, often employing brutal methods and carrying out illegal detentions, a new report from Human Rights Watch claims. The 76-page report, ""Beat Him, Take Everything Away,"" documents abuses by the Urban Management Law Enforcement units, known as ""chengguan,"" whose principle function is to assist regular police in tackling low-level crime in urban areas such as traffic violations and unauthorized street vendors. It says the behavior of ""thuggish"" officers has caused widespread public anger and undermined social stability. While they have the power to impose fines on violators, the chengguan do not have the authority to detain people or use excessive force. Read the full report here . But victims of chengguan abuse -- many of them street vendors -- describe being dragged, punched, kicked, and thrown from their vehicles to the street for no apparent reason, while others report being ordered to pay arbitrary fines or even being taken into custody without a reason given. One victim, a 32-year-old migrant from Henan province, told HRW that three chengguan officers in Beijing got onto her cart and without explanation began confiscating the grapes she was selling. When she protested, they began kicking and cursing her. They said ""F*** your mother. You dare ask us for a reason?"" Last year, three officers from a local city management bureau in northeast China's Liaoning Province were arrested after a man died when he was attacked trying to lay cement outside his home, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. No details about the fate of the officers were given. The New York-based rights group claims chengguan have also been implicated in the forced eviction of residents from their homes ""at a time when alleged collusion between corrupt officials and property developers has created what a Chinese human rights organization has described as a 'pandemic of illegal demolition' in China."" HRW says the report is based on interviews with victims of abuse and other research in six Chinese cities between mid-2009 and 2011, and builds on work documenting violations by Chinese police and other public security forces over the past five years, including enforced disappearances, abuses in detention and torture. ""One of the alarming aspects of the chengguan is that there is no clear national framework -- a legal one, a training one -- for supervising and disciplining the chengguan,"" Sophie Richardson, HRW's China Director told CNN. ""It's up to the individual municipalities how to define and manage these forces, so it's very unclear to whom they can be held accountable."" In November last year, the Beijing Urban Management Bureau issued guidance for its enforcement officers, according to a Beijing Evening News report cited by China Daily. New guidelines prohibit officers from beating, abusing or insulting the other party, the forceful seizure of goods, forceful checks on vehicles, chasing vehicles and chasing people on foot. More than 7,000 urban management officers and 6,500 security guards and assistants would receive training on the new regulations, the article added. The HRW report comes at time when China's Communist Party is battling to restore a sense of unity and stability in the country as it prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition. Recent allegations of abuses by Chongqing authorities under disgraced former Party chief Bo Xilai, and the controversy surrounding the treatment of blind activist Chen Guangcheng, have put the leadership on the back foot. Chinese human rights activist Chen arrives in U.S. Richardson pointed to a similarly sensitive period for China's leadership as the country prepared to host the 2008 Olympic Games, and it invested heavily in its security forces, giving them more resources and political power to reinforce their control. The rise of the chengguan, she says, is consistent with that strategy, though it appears to be backfiring. ""Part of the point we're trying to make with this report is to say 'this force is causing instability by virtue of its brutal conduct,'"" she said. ""It's prompting violent reprisals on the street. If really what you're looking for is policing in the sense of the way we understand it, this is not the solution."" A protest in Anshun, Guizhou province in July last year was sparked by reports that local chengguan had beaten a disabled fruit vendor to death, Caixin Online reported. The crowd clashed briefly with city authorities before eventually dispersing. The middle-aged street vender, who had a false leg, was chased by officers before he was attacked, witnesses reported in microblogs cited by Caixin. Chinese authorities could not be immediately contacted for a response to the HRW report.","""Beat Him, Take Everything Away,"" cites abuses by Urban Management Law Enforcement unit .

"(CNN) -- It's no bloody, foot-stomping battle to the death, but a legal fight befitting a mighty dinosaur is playing out on two continents as Mongolia's president tries to block the sale of a nearly complete skeleton of a 24-foot-long dinosaur that roamed Central Asia 80 million years ago. Despite a Texas judge's order barring the sale at the behest of Mongolian President Elbegdorj Tsakhia, a Dallas-based auction house on Sunday unloaded the rare skeleton of a Tarbosaurus bataar -- also known as Tyrannosaurus bataar -- to an undisclosed buyer for $1,052,500 at an auction in New York. An attorney for Mongolia tried to stop the sale, standing up and waving a cell phone with the Texas judge waiting on the other side, but auction officials declined to stop the sale and escorted the lawyer outside. ""This is a once-in-a-generation dinosaur and collectors definitely responded to both its rarity and its fierce beauty,"" David Herskowitz of Heritage Auctions said in a statement after the sale. ""A dino like this is rare to come across in any condition, let alone one as pristine as this."" The dispute is the latest in a series of battles between national governments and private collectors over cultural artifacts, including rare fossils. Governments such as Mongolia's are concerned about maintaining control over fossil and cultural relics while scientists worry about such items disappearing into private collections. ""At stake are the heritage, history and culture of a sovereign nation,"" attorneys for Tsakhia said in a filing asking for the restraining order. Tsakhia had sought to stop the auction, saying it would be illegal to sell the fossil if it had been recovered from his country. While Heritage Auctions didn't say where the fossil had been unearthed, paleontologist Lawrence Witmer of Ohio University said it is almost certainly Mongolian. Most if not all of the examples of the species recovered so far have come from a single geological formation in Mongolia called the Nemegt Formation. ""From what any of us can tell from the photographs on the auction site, the specimen is a typical Nemegt Tarbosaurus from Mongolia,"" he said. Although Heritage Auctions went ahead with the sale, it is describing it as contingent on a resolution of the Texas court case. ""We respect the various opinions on the subject and wish to protect the legal rights of all parties involved,"" Heritage Auctions President Greg Rohan said in a statement Sunday. ""We have legal assurances from our reputable consignors that the specimen was obtained legally. As far as we know, the Mongolian government has not produced any evidence that the piece originated in its territory, but the final determination will be up to the American legal system,"" he said. In legal filings, Tsakhia's attorneys cited media reports in which Herskowitz was quoted as saying the skeleton had been recovered in the Gobi Desert, a part of which lies within Mongolia. The filing also cited dinosaur experts who believe the specimen, which is 75% complete, probably came from Mongolia. It had been stored in England until it was brought to the United States last year, according to Heritage Auctions. Tarbosaurus bataar was similar to, but slightly smaller than, the better-known Tyrannosaurus rex. Like its North American counterpart, the dinosaur was a dominant carnivore that lived in the Cretaceous period. While the auction house referred to it as a Tyrannosaurus, most scientists consider the name Tarbosaurus to now be correct, Witmer said. While separate species, the two were ""very closely related,"" he said. Many paleontologists disapprove of the sale of fossils, saying museums are often unable to afford the frequently high prices at auction, according to the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. The group also says that placing important specimens in private collections beyond the reach of researchers and the public could harm scientific inquiry and dampen the enthusiasm of children to pursue careers in science.","NEW: Auctioned fossil is almost certainly from Mongolia, paleontologist says .

"Washington (CNN) -- With longtime Republican Sen. Dick Lugar going down in defeat, Democrats were quick to paint the conservative candidate who beat him in Indiana's primary as ""too extreme."" The result in Indiana was what Democrats had hoped for, but as the old proverb goes: ""Be careful what you wish for, it might just come true."" Lugar is the longest-serving Republican in the Senate and is known as a moderate who has been willing to reach across the aisle to work with Democrats during his 36 years in the chamber. He was defeated by more than 20 points in Tuesday's primary by Richard Mourdock, the two-term Indiana state treasurer, a much more conservative candidate who enjoyed strong backing from local and national tea party groups, as well as some other leading fiscal conservative organizations. Mourdock says he doesn't anticipate successful compromise in the Senate and hopes bipartisanship will be defined as Democrats backing the Republican agenda following the 2012 elections. ""I hope to build a conservative majority so bipartisanship becomes Democrats joining Republicans to roll back the size of government, reduce the bureaucracy and get America moving again,"" Mourdock said Wednesday morning on CNN's ""Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien."" He added that those on both sides of the aisle should not compromise their principles, saying that ""one side or the other has to win this argument, one side or the other will dominate."" Minutes after Mourdock's victory over Lugar, national Democrats were quick to characterize Mourdock as too extreme for Indiana. ""Richard Mourdock is a right wing Tea Party ideologue who questioned the constitutionality of Medicare and Social Security, says there should be more partisanship and less compromise in Washington, and actually compared himself to Rosa Parks,"" declared Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, in a statement. ""Tens of thousands of Hoosiers who have voted for Dick Lugar their entire voting lives are going to reject a Tea Party candidate like Richard Mourdock and support an honest, common sense job creator like Joe Donnelly,"" added Cecil. Donnelly, the Democrats' Senate nominee, is a former small business owner and current three-term congressman who represents Indiana's second district, which includes South Bend and other areas of the north-central part of the state. Cecil compared Mourdock to Ken Buck, the former Weld County, Colorado, district attorney who defeated the more moderate former Lt. Gov. Jane Norton in Colorado's 2010 GOP Senate primary then went on to lose his general election challenge to Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet. National Democrats hope that Donnelly will fare better against Mourdock than he would have against Lugar in a general election, where moderate voters from both parties and independents are crucial in determining who wins and loses. National Republicans quickly rallied around Mourdock. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement that Mourdock ""has the NRSC's full support and we are committed to helping elect him as Indiana's next U.S. Senator in November."" And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he fully backs Mourdock and looks ""forward to welcoming him to the United States Senate next year."" Freshman Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a darling of conservatives, sent an e-mail to his fundraising list Tuesday night, asking people to donate to Mourdock's campaign. While Republicans rally around Mourdock, Democrats have the match-up they dreamed about in Indiana. They suggest that many ""disillusioned"" Lugar supporters may now cross over and vote for Donnelly. And Cecil said that the Mourdock victory over Lugar ""makes the Indiana Senate race a toss-up."" But that's not the take right now from two of the top non-partisan political handicappers. The Rothenberg Political Report is keeping its ranking of the contest as ""Lean Republican."" ""Richard Mourdock isn't Christine O'Donnell,"" says Stuart Rothenberg, the report's editor and publisher. O'Donnell was the tea party-backed candidate in Delaware who pulled an upset in the state's 2010 GOP Senate primary, defeating longtime Rep. Mike Castle, the GOP establishment candidate. O'Donnell lost by 16 points in the general election to Democrat Chris Coons. ""While a Mourdock-Donnelly race will start off close, with some Republicans bitter over Dick Lugar's loss, over the long haul, Democrats have a decidedly uphill fight in this Republican-leaning state,"" Rothenberg added. The Cook Political Report is moving its rating of the race from ""Likely Republican"" to ""Lean Republican."" ""This race is more competitive than it would have been if Lugar were the GOP nominee. We don't feel that it's in the toss up column now, but there's a potential to get there,"" saysJennifer Duffy, who covers Senate races for Cook. Then-Sen. Barack Obama won Indiana in 2008, the first Democrat to capture the state in a presidential election in 40 years. But Obama's re-election campaign may not spend a great amount of money and resources to try to keep the state in the ""D"" column this November, further complicating the Democrats' hopes of capturing Lugar's Senate seat. As for the big picture, the Democrats currently hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate. But they are defending 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs in November.","Democrats hoped to run against Mourdock, who they say is too ""extreme""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Thursday new proposals targeting individuals who sell SNAP cards, commonly known as food stamps, for cash. The agency said individuals suspected of defrauding the system are requesting a large number of replacement cards. Food stamp fraud has gone high-tech in recent years, with SNAP cards being sold on Craigslist and eBay, according to the USDA. There also have been attempts to sell the food assistance benefits through the popular social media sites Twitter and Facebook. Replacement cards are issued to recipients on a case-by-case basis, but increased scrutiny is needed to root out the thieves, the USDA said. ""There are many legitimate reasons for replacing cards, and the vast majority of recipients follow the rules,"" said Kevin Concannon, agriculture undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services. ""But we are concerned that a few bad actors are using replacement cards to exchange SNAP benefits for cash, (an activity) commonly referred to as trafficking."" The rules proposed Thursday will give states the option to place individuals under increased scrutiny when they have asked for an excessive number of replacement cards. Determination of when requests are excessive and require further investigation will be up to the states. States will be required to protect elderly individuals and people with disabilities who may repeatedly lose their cards but are not committing fraud, the proposal noted. According to the USDA, current laws don't permit states to contact households for information about requests for multiple replacements, which in some cases may indicate fraudulent activity. Trafficking SNAP cards is illegal and punishable in several ways, including disqualification from the program, fines, and criminal prosecution, according to the USDA. Over the past 15 years, Agriculture Department officials said, they have aggressively put into place a number of measures to reduce fraud within the SNAP system. But it's not just individuals who are gaming the system, the agency said. So far this year, the USDA has imposed sanctions, including fines or temporary disqualifications, on 198 stores found violating program rules. In addition, 366 stores have been permanently kicked out of the SNAP program for exchanging SNAP benefits for cash. The USDA said it plans to announce additional sanctions and penalties being developed for fraudulent retailers, along with increased efforts to ensure those who are booted from the system in one state don't regain access by applying for SNAP benefits in another state. The USDA said that last year investigators reviewed over 15,000 stores. More than 1,200 stores were permanently disqualified for trafficking and more than 600 were sanctioned for other violations, such as applying the benefits to purchases of ineligible items. SNAP stands for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It began under the name ""food stamps,"" using paper stamps or coupons. Debit-type cards were phased in beginning in the 1990s.","The USDA wants to crack down on people who sell SNAP cards for cash .

"(CNN) -- If your gift list this year includes gadget-obsessed early adopters who love snatching up the latest electronics, you're in luck. Why not give them an iArm -- an adjustable forearm mount that will let them fiddle with their smartphone, laptop and tablet computer all at the same time? Or for the e-geek on the go, consider the iDrive. Because, let's be honest, we all need a steering-wheel mount to help play with our tablets and e-readers while we're driving. (What could go wrong?) Sound ridiculous? Well, sure. But these gag products may at least let you fool your family and friends for a few seconds. Graphic designer Arik Nordby said he got the idea for Prank Pack when his nephew received a video-game console cruelly hidden inside a coffee-maker box. ""Being a good kid, he pretended to be excited for a little bit. There was this awkward moment,"" Nordby said. ""It kind of stuck in my head -- why don't we do this for adults?"" And thus was Prank Pack born. Nordby teamed up with some staffers at humor site The Onion, a handful of whom now work with him at 30 Watt, his graphics company based in Minneappolis. The idea is to hide a real gift inside the real-looking, if remarkably silly, packaging for the fake gifts. Some of the tech-inspired bogus products bear a resemblance to those from a certain gadget-making powerhouse (note the lowercase ""i"" if you're confused). Nordby concedes that's no accident. ""I am a sucker for anything with an 'i' in front of it,"" he said. ""After using Apple products for over 20 years, it's safe to say they own a large section of my brain."" In addition to the aforementioned ""i"" items, other Prank Packs include ToeTunes, or bedroom slippers with built-in speakers, and PetPetter, an electronic armlike contraption that will, yes, pet your dog or cat for you. The tag line on the box reads, ""Never touch your pets again!"" For more options, The Onion offers its own ""Decoy Gift Boxes."" Among them is the iFeast, a combination feeding bowl/iPod dock so your pet can rock out while chowing down. At $8 each or three for $20, Nordby said he's seen sales roughly double every year for seven years. The packs are sold at Bed Bath & Beyond and numerous online retailers, including Think Geek. He's no economist, but Nordby said his growing success has to say something about the retail climate this holiday season. ""We like to say it's a good economic indicator when people are willing to pay for empty boxes,"" he said.","Fool your gadget-obsessed friends with the iArm or iDrive from Prank Pack .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Yahoo and China's Alibaba Group have agreed to a $7.1 billion deal in which the Hangzhou-based internet behemoth buys back half of Yahoo's 40% stake in the company. The agreement will give a much-welcomed cash injection to Yahoo, which has lost 65% of its value since its 2006 peak and is smarting from the resume-padding scandal of ex-CEO Scott Thompson, the third chief executive to lead the beleaguered web portal in three years. Yahoo's 40% stake in Alibaba, purchased in 2005 for $1 billion, is widely considered the company's greatest asset. But the relationship has been a fractious one, punctuated with public disagreements over company direction, as well as Yahoo siding with Google in its 2010 fight with Chinese regulators. Alibaba CEO Jack Ma publicly said in September he might be interested in buying Yahoo. ""This transaction opens a new chapter in our relationship with Yahoo,"" Ma said in a news release Monday. Alibaba is a leading e-commerce provider in China, the world's largest internet market. ""Today's agreement provides clarity for our shareholders on a substantial component of Yahoo!'s value and reaffirms the significance of our relationship with Alibaba,"" said Ross Levinsohn, interim CEO of Yahoo, in a release on the deal. Under the terms of the deal, Yahoo will get $6.3 billion in cash and up to $800 million in newly issued Alibaba preferred stock. ""We look forward to delivering the proceeds of the near-term transaction to our shareholders, and to the further enhancement of value and the additional monetization in the future that this agreement enables,"" said Timothy R. Morse, chief financial officer of Yahoo.","Yahoo and China's Alibaba Group have agreed to a $7.1 billion share buyback deal .

"(CNN) -- Bluegrass music legend Doc Watson, a Grammy winner known for his flatpicking and fingerstyle technique on the guitar, remained in critical condition at a hospital in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, his representative said Saturday. Watson, 89, had colon surgery at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, according to a post Thursday on the website of Folklore Productions, which is run by the singer's representative, Mitch Greenhill. A day later, Greenhill said Watson was ""resting and responsive"" at the hospital in central North Carolina. ""He has regained some strength,"" Greenhill said Friday on the website. ""The family appreciates everyone's prayers and good wishes."" Greenhill posted another update Saturday morning stating that Watson was ""resting after (a) follow-up procedure"" to Thursday's surgery and was still in critical condition. Jumping onto the music scene in the early 1960s, Watson is considered influential among folk musicians for his brand of bluegrass, blues, country and gospel music. He has won seven Grammy awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Born Arthel Lane Watson in Deep Gap, North Carolina, Watson was blinded from an eye infection as a baby. He toured with his son Merle before his death after a farming accident in 1985, and has continually played at an annual festival called MerleFest in his son's honor. Watson has credited his own father for helping him get his start in music. ""One day he brought (a banjo) to me and put it in my hand and said, 'Son, I want you to learn how to play this thing real well,"" Watson told National Public Radio's Terry Gross in 1988. ""It might help you get through the world.""

"(Mashable) -- Facebook is testing a series of cosmetic changes to the top of users' Timelines, the company has confirmed.

"(CNN) -- The Galaxy Nexus, a smartphone that arrived in Verizon Wireless stores on Thursday, is huge -- and not just because of its unusually large size. The new Android phone, which has been available in Britain for weeks, is the first to run Android 4.0, the latest version of the popular mobile operating system that also goes by the adorable name Ice Cream Sandwich. This is a very significant update to Android for smartphones. I've tested the UK version of the Galaxy Nexus for about a week. It looks and functions about the same as the one for Verizon, except that the U.S. model uses different cellular chips to accommodate Verizon's legacy infrastructure and its fourth-generation LTE data network. The U.S. version also does not run Google Wallet, the mobile payment system. The phone costs $300 with a two-year service contract. The Galaxy Nexus' operating system takes many of the concepts that were designed for Android tablets, shrinks them and unlocks their great potential to an audience that will likely be much larger. Android tablets have not fared particularly well in the market, which means that this interface will look fresh to most people. (Amazon's Kindle Fire, which analysts say has sold well at $199, is a tablet based on Android but looks completely different.) Fewer buttons . Perhaps the most significant change to the software is that Google has done away with the hardware buttons below the screen. These have become touchscreen buttons, which aren't all that different, but the direction they face flips depending on which way I'm holding the phone. It's a nice touch. Now, there are only three onscreen buttons, instead of the usual four. These are used for returning to the previous menu, going to the home screen or viewing which apps are currently open. But many older Android apps will stick a button, which looks like ellipses printed in Hebrew, on the end of those touchscreen buttons. It handles miscellaneous actions. Developers are expected to update future versions of their apps to remove this button and instead incorporate those functions somewhere onscreen. In complex programs, like the Web browser or the app market, Google puts the everything-else button on the top bar. When moving quickly between old and new apps, I found myself losing track of where to look for extra functions. The dedicated multitasking button, in place of the search button, is a welcome addition. In previous versions a list of open apps could be activated by holding down the home button, but newcomers to the system had no idea it was there. Rather than showing six icons, the button pulls up a list with snapshots of each program as they were when I left them. These pictures are generally too small to be useful, unlike on Android tablets where this provides a handy visual cue. Android 4.0 . The Galaxy Nexus hardware is born from a collaboration between Google and Samsung. Much of the new operating system has gotten a thick coat of polish. In the apps menu, the buttons tilt slightly to denote when I've encountered the end of the list. As I flip through, one page slides away as another smoothly pops into view. When cleaning up the notifications list, each line slides out separately like Jenga pieces. Turn off the screen, and it fades to black with a flicker of white in the middle, like a 1960s television set. These aesthetic pleasantries are sprinkled throughout Apple's competing iOS, like the icons dancing when they're ready to be rearranged, but this type of elegance has been less common in Android. The subtle changes make Google's software seem friendlier, in contrast to the sharp, weapon-like Droid from before. Despite its historical roughness, Android found a huge audience among people who were not eager to take on the expenses associated with the iPhone. Now that Apple has cut the prices on its phones and found a home at three of the four largest U.S. operators, Android is making itself more accessible, and not a moment too soon. The phone and contact list apps in Android 4.0 automatically create groups of frequently-contacted people to accompany the favorites feature. Those apps look like miniature social networks, with detailed profiles and big pictures of friends. Apps and features . Yet there remain many tools for gearheads. Some of these are perhaps so ""in your face"" that they may deter less advanced users. A widget for toggling the phone's various sensors, like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, is situated on one of the home screens. The icons may be familiar to pros, but my mom would not be able to identify each of the five or know what to use them for. The widgets can, of course, be ignored, but users should eventually take the time to learn them. These little doodads, which can be dragged to the various home screens, are more robust and customizable in Android 4.0. They are also easier to find, nestled right next to the list of apps installed on the phone. A new Data Usage monitor in the settings menu is a data lover's or cheapskate's new best friend. It presents detailed graphs about how many bytes the phone is sucking down from the cell network, separated by individual apps. It lets users manage their monthly caps in a very geeky, useful way. However, the app crashed several times during my week of testing. Some of the other power-user options are overcomplicated. For example, the main screen contains three separate apps that many would assume do the same thing: Messenger, Messaging and Talk, all of which have chat-bubble icons. The first is for group chats using the Google+ social network; the second is for text messaging through cell networks; and the third is for instant messaging through Google's network. This sort of hyper-option syndrome extends to smiley faces. The new Android has a detailed directory of smileys. I'm not sure if this is designed for power users looking for just the right trio of characters to express their precise emotions or as a reference guide for moms. Either way, I learned some new things: Specifically, that :-| means ""poker face,"" that :-! means ""foot in mouth,"" and that :-$ means ""money mouth."" Whatever that means. Sturdy, but too big? Despite the new cuddly Android features, the phone looks like a tool of the military. The back looks like a metal grate, although it's actually plastic. It comes off to allow me to easily change the battery, but it doesn't snap on very easily. Still, it's nice that I can switch out the battery, unlike the iPhone. The Galaxy Nexus does have plenty of curves, including the screen itself, which Google says is done to fit the contour of a face when making a call. But at 4.65 inches diagonally, the screen feels a little silly when pressed against my ear. Because the screen is so gigantic, I had some difficulty operating it with one hand, struggling to stretch my thumb from one corner to switch apps and back to the other corner to compose an e-mail. Typing requires more dexterity because my thumbs have to travel farther between keys. But YouTube videos and Netflix movies look fantastic on the big display. Phone calls are crisp, and the speaker phone is fairly loud. Battery life is adequate in normal usage, but I did not test the Verizon version on the faster, LTE network. Likely, battery life will suffer as a tradeoff for that speed. The GPS navigator that has been in past versions of Android is still free and still great, but battery life is abysmal, at about three hours. Bring a car charger. The sheer size of the Galaxy Nexus puts me off, but the hardware and companion software is sturdy and impressive. When other manufacturers adopt Android 4.0, I expect to see some very compelling phones, though I do wonder how well the new version, without hardware buttons, would work on a smaller screen. We will find out soon enough. The Galaxy Nexus provides a clear view of the next generation of powerful Android phones, and I look forward to seeing what comes next.","The Galaxy Nexus was born from a collaboration between Google and Samsung .

"(CNN) -- Not long ago it seemed like Jose Mourinho might be parting company with Real Madrid, but now the ""Special One"" has committed to the newly-crowned Spanish champions until mid-2016. The club announced on Tuesday that the Portuguese coach had agreed terms on a new deal, having moved to the Santiago Bernabeu on a four-year contract in May 2010. ""The manager has won La Liga and the Copa del Rey, establishing impressive records at the club and in every championship, therefore prompting his contract to be extended,"" Real's website reported. In January, the 49-year-old was reportedly considering quitting at the end of this season due to an alleged dressing-room rift with the team's Spanish contingent and unhappiness at board level after bad-tempered defeats against bitter rivals Barcelona. He had been linked with a possible return to England, and such speculation continued after his former club Chelsea won the Champions League for the first time on Saturday under interim manager Roberto di Matteo. However, his reported unhappiness at Real appears to be water under the bridge after Los Blancos ended Barca's three-year La Liga title reign in fine style, setting records for points and goals scored. Mourinho became the first coach to win league titles in England, Italy and Spain, being the first Portuguese manager to triumph in the latter nation. He matched Ernst Happel and Giovanni Trapattoni in winning in four different European countries, including his own -- only Bela Guttman and Tomislav Ivic have clinched league titles in more nations. Mourinho is still seeking to become the first coach to win the European Champions League with three different clubs, having already done so with Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010. He took Real Madrid to the semifinals last season for the first time since 2003, and also won the Spanish Cup. This season brought more European disappointment, losing to Bayern Munich in the semis after a penalty shootout, but there was consolation on the domestic front as Real finished nine points clear of Barca. Mourinho's star player Cristiano Ronaldo told CNN last week that he thinks his compatriot is the best coach in the world. ""This is why he wins the titles that he won. Because for me, not just because I work with him, but he's the best because of what he does: the tactics, everything around the players, the motivation ... and you know, the titles speak for themselves,"" Ronaldo said. ""He won in every country that he's passed, so I think that's great. I think nobody ... two or three coaches do that in their lives, so we have to appreciate that.""","Jose Mourinho extends his contract at Real Madrid until end of 2015-16 season .

"(Financial Times) -- Nasdaq OMX's chief executive admitted he was ""embarrassed"" by the delay in the opening trade of Facebook's initial public offering and revealed that the exchange was in talks with regulators over potentially millions of dollars of customer claims. Bob Greifeld said on Sunday that the 20-minute delay in trading of Facebook's $16bn offering on Friday had been caused by a millisecond systems blip due to the largest IPO auction ""in the history of mankind"". The exchange has found itself in the spotlight after Facebook failed to deliver a first-day ""pop"" to investors, instead almost falling below its issuing price of $38. The shares, having risen briefly, quickly fell away to close the day with a gain of just 0.6 per cent, at $38.23. As a result of the trading delay, Nasdaq was left with a position in Facebook shares that it had to liquidate, according to its own rules, generating $10m for the group. It plans to use that money to resolve disputes related to 30m shares that may have been the subject of improper trades, and has requested approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission to do so, said Mr Greifeld. The SEC said on Friday it would ""review"" the incident. The glitch, coming just weeks after BATS Global Markets was forced to withdraw its IPO after technical problems, highlighted the fragile nature of modern equity markets, in which exchanges must handle many thousands of messages a second transmitted by high-frequency traders. Mr Greifeld defended Nasdaq's performance, citing its role in Facebook's trading over the whole of the session, which saw more than 580m shares change hands, the largest ever number for an IPO. ""These problems are real and we have to improve from the performance we had on Friday,"" Mr Greifeld said. ""We stand humbly embarrassed by that. But the rest of the day ... the system performed well."" Nasdaq has now laid out the details of the glitch. In spite of testing 1bn in trading volumes under 100 scenarios, the exchange was caught by surprise when cancellations of trades kept interrupting the computer system's attempt to complete the auction and produce an initial price for Facebook's opening. Nasdaq says it designed its ""IPO cross"", the process of calculating the opening price, in such a way that would allow continuous trading through an auction at the behest of its customers and has used the system in previous IPOs. But in processing the huge volume of Facebook trades, it added two milliseconds to the time it took to produce an opening price. In that extra two milliseconds, orders to cancel the trades kept interrupting the auction process, or as Mr Greifeld put it, ""fitting in between the raindrops"". Mr Greifeld said: ""On a real time basis with the pressure of the world upon us ... we intercepted this cross in a loop."" He said there was no discussion at any point of cancelling the IPO. Facebook and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Nasdaq's description of the events of the day. As a result of the glitch the exchange decided to print the opening trade manually but was then forced to delay the process of confirming individual trades. The mechanism has now been altered to prevent continuous quoting during IPO auctions, Mr Greifeld said. ""We had a poor design for the Facebook opening cross IPO. We recognise the design has relative merit for investors where we give them maximum optionality, but it didn't' work in this scenario."" Nasdaq has identified trading orders for some 30m shares that came in between 11.11am and 11.30am, when trading actually began. It estimates that 50 per cent of those may have been orders not executed at the IPO price, as traders may have expected them to be. But it is still investigating to determine how many grievances are legitimate. Mr Greifeld said Nasdaq was ""working very hard with customers to make sure about the accommodations we give to respective customers"". Eric Noll, executive vice-president at Nasdaq, said there were no other ""systematic"" technical problems. Nasdaq's board of directors had been informed over the weekend of Friday's events, Mr Greifeld said. When asked if he thought his job was safe, he said: ""I certainly hope so. I obviously serve at the pleasure of the board."" The exchange group had pushed hard to win the Facebook IPO from its rival New York Stock Exchange, as it seeks supremacy in listings for internet companies that make up one of the few vibrant sectors of the new issue market. Mr Greifeld responded directly to arguments that Nasdaq's delay played a role in Facebook's stock failing to ""pop"". Some market participants have said the delayed confirmations caused confusion and prevented some buyers stepping in to the market to support Facebook's stock price. ""You want to look at whether your position is moving up or down. Without that, there was a lot of pressure to liquidate,"" said one trader at a market-making firm. However, Mr Greifeld said that the record did not support that theory, noting that after the delayed trades were made live at 1.50pm, traders did not buy at the $42.05 level that was the initial print. ""That would lead a reasonable person to conclude [the opening cross print delay] didn't have any impact on the stock price,"" he said. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Nasdaq OMX's chief executive admitted he was ""embarrassed"" by the delay in the opening trade .

"(CNN) -- Sitting on a simple chair, shirtless except for a bandage covering a part of his arm, the man seems relaxed. Almost cool, he smiles at one point and cracks a joke. ""Go ahead, you can ask me questions if you want. It's strange. Normally, I'm the one asking questions. I'm the journalist,"" he says. ""But it's OK."" The video, broadcast Monday by the Venezuelan Telesur network, is the first to show images of French journalist Romeo Langlois since he was captured last month by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC. Statement: FARC to release Langlois . Langlois, a war journalist with more than 10 years of experience in Colombia, was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group opened fire, according to the government. Four people were killed and six were wounded in the April 28 attack. Over the weekend, FARC announced that it would release Langlois on Wednesday. The video shows him stating and spelling his name. He receives treatment for an arm wound and talks about his experience reporting on the conflict in Colombia. ""I cover both sides, seeking the opinion of everyone,"" he says. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the video, which gave no indication as to when it was shot. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has said his government would do whatever was necessary to guarantee Langlois' release. ""The Colombian government is willing to provide all the facilities so the release occurs as quickly as possible, but if you really want to be viewed well by the world, release him now and simply tell us where he is and we will go get him,"" he said this month. The rebel group has been at war with the government since the 1960s, making it Latin American's oldest insurgency. While severely weakened in recent years, FARC continues to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces.","French journalist Romeo Langlois appears in a video broadcast by Telesur .

"(Financial Times) -- ""It's very important that Apple not become the developer for the world,"" Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, told analysts last month. ""We need people to invent their own stuff."" On Monday, he is due to express those same feelings face-to-face with Choi Gee-Sung, chief executive of Samsung -- the Korean company that Apple alleges is the chief culprit in copying its iPhone and iPad inventions. Their two days of judge-ordered settlement talks in a San Francisco courthouse will attempt to find a resolution to their rival patent claims, before a full-blown jury trial gets under way, scheduled for July. This is the key dispute among more than 50 cases that have developed between the two companies over the past year in 10 different countries. Any agreement hammered out here could bring others round the world to a swift conclusion. ""I don't know if the parties will settle; this case is just one part of a very complex ecosystem, and putting CEOs in the room together is always a roll of the dice,"" says Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School. ""But both parties need to settle the larger war and get on with innovating. Fighting all the patent battles to the end will leave no one the victor."" Apple seems to be the one more eager for a resolution at present, and not just because of Tim Cook's feelings. ""I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it ... I would highly prefer to settle versus battle,"" he said in April. The urgency for Apple and its lawyers is that Samsung has overtaken it in smartphone sales on the back of Apple's leadership in innovation. It shipped 45m smartphones in the first quarter, according to Strategy Analytics, compared with Apple's 35m. ""Samsung has vaulted into first place in worldwide sales of smartphones, with massive sales of its copycat products,"" alleged a recent Apple filing. ""Samsung's infringement of Apple's intellectual property has already resulted in damages that reach billions of dollars."" Apple has pursued injunctions and import bans to try to keep not just Samsung out of its markets, but HTC and Motorola as well, all three Samsungbeing users of Google's rival Android operating system. HTC's latest Evo 4G LTE phone was impounded by US Customs last week following an International Trade Commission decision in Apple's favour. Apple filed on Friday for an injunction to ban Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet. The battle with Samsung began in Northern California in April 2011, with Apple filing a 373-page complaint of patent and trademark infringement. Other skirmishes have since broken out in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Netherlands, Australia, Japan and South Korea. Apple's original complaint includes allegations that Samsung infringed on elements of the iPhone's look -- its rectangular shape, rounded corners, silver edges, black face and display of icons. It also alleges Samsung copied features such as the way instant messaging was displayed and even mimicked Apple's trademarked touch-icons for applications such as Phone, Contacts, Photos and iTunes. Samsung hit back with its own list of alleged patent infringements by Apple -- backed by its 6,000-strong US telecoms patent portfolio and its claim to have first introduced a smartphone as far back as 1999. The key patents Samsung relied on all relate to the inner workings of phones and how they connect to 3G networks. Florian Mueller, an independent patent analyst, says that Samsung could land itself in more trouble by going to war with patents that are essential to standards such as 3G. Antitrust authorities are already investigating whether these should be ""Frand"" patents -- available for anyone to use under ""fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory"" terms. For its part, Apple is fighting over design elements that are already disappearing in newer models as companies figure out workarounds to possible infringements. For example, Android phones and tablets are ""unlocked"" by swiping from inside a circle on their touchscreens now, rather than swiping along a bar, as on the iPhone. David Martin, chairman of M-Cam, a US patent analysis company, says there is so much ""prior art"" -- earlier innovations covering similar ground -- that Apple and Samsung are inviting subsequent third-party litigation by airing the strengths and weaknesses of their patents in public. ""Third-party patent holders, of which there are literally thousands in this space, are salivating over the fact that you are going to have this ongoing acrimony, allowing people essentially to learn where constructive claims of infringement can be made,"" he says. Apple did not respond to a request for comment on its litigation. Samsung declined to comment. However, for Apple at least, it is about far more than banning rival products, winning damages or earning royalties in any future licensing agreements, according to Mr Mueller. ""It's critical that its products continue to be able to distinguish themselves with unique features,"" he says. ""That's what drives consumers to buy them, that's what sustain its margins and make this all worth tens even hundreds of billions of dollars to Apple."" © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Samsung, Apple begins two days of judge-ordered settlement talks in a San Francisco courthouse .

"(CNN) -- A wildfire that has raged for days in Michigan's Upper Peninsula has destroyed 97 structures -- including a motel, a store and 34 homes. The Duck Lake Fire has burned more than 22,000 acres and is still going despite recent rains, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources reported on its website. The state agency estimated Monday the blaze is about 51% contained, thanks to progress made by firefighters in maintaining a firm perimeter. Crews have about 40 miles of firelines set up to control the situation, including 6 miles along the shore of Lake Superior. But a lack of roads in the area has complicated efforts. The fire's south end is about 14 miles north of Newberry and 7 miles west of the Yahquamenon Falls State Park campgrounds. Lightning sparked the wildfire late Wednesday afternoon, leaving firefighters little time to contain it before dark. The flames picked up significantly the next day, fanned by strong winds and high temperatures. Since then, the wildfire has taken its toll. While noting that the entire affected area has not been surveyed, the state department said at least 97 structures on 39 different properties have been ""lost"" due to the blaze. Dry conditions have exacerbated the fire danger throughout the region. On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder banned outdoor burning in 49 counties in northern Michigan in hopes of preventing wildfires.","The Duck Lake Fire is raging in Michigan's Upper Peninsula .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Lawyers for former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn urged a judge on Wednesday to dismiss a civil suit brought against him by the New York hotel housekeeper who accused him of assaulting her last year. The case ""must be dismissed,"" asserted lawyer Amit Mehta, because Strauss-Kahn enjoyed diplomatic immunity as an ""executive of a multilateral organization."" Judge Douglas McKeon told the Bronx courtroom that he would ""expeditiously issue a decision"" deciding whether the case could proceed. Strauss-Kahn headed the IMF, an international organization consisting of 187 member-states with headquarters in Washington, D.C. The IMF provides loans to countries that are suffering economic difficulties. He resigned his position soon after his arrest by New York police in May 2011, when he was charged with criminally assaulting a housekeeper in a Manhattan hotel suite. The housekeeper, Nafissatou Diallo, accused Strauss-Kahn of attempting to rape her when she walked into his suite. Police subsequently removed him from an Air France flight about to depart New York's Kennedy Airport and jailed him before his arraignment in criminal court. The arrest of such a high-profile international political figure who was preparing a presidential run in his native France sparked worldwide media interest. But, the criminal case against Strauss-Kahn was later dropped by New York prosecutors, because of credibility issues they cited in Diallo's account. The interesting life of Dominique Strauss-Kahn . In August, Diallo's lawyers served Strauss-Kahn with a civil suit seeking damages stemming from the alleged assault in the hotel. Lawyer Douglas Wigdor told the court Wednesday that Strauss-Kahn ""brutally sexually assaulted"" Diallo, arguing that Strauss-Kahn does not enjoy blanket diplomatic immunity from civil action. As head of the IMF, Strauss-Kahn did enjoy some immunity, but a key sticking point is whether it extended to situations beyond his official duties. ""Immunity is only provided for official actions,"" argued Wigdor. ""Absolute immunity does not apply to all situations."" Strauss-Kahn's lawyers did not invoke his immunity from prosecution during the criminal case. Wigdor ridiculed the fact that they would invoke it in the civil case, but not the criminal case as ""piecemeal immunity."" But, Mehta countered that Strauss-Kahn was eager to assert his innocence in the criminal proceedings, and so he didn't invoke whatever immunity he enjoyed as IMF chief. In the months following the hotel accusation last year, other allegations surfaced. Anne Mansouret, a Socialist member of the French parliament, said Strauss-Kahn had attacked her daughter. A complaint was filed, alleging a 2002 attack, though it could not be pursued because the statute of limitations had expired. Currently, Strauss-Kahn faces another legal battle -- this time the case centers on an investigation into a high-profile prostitution network operating out of luxury hotels in the French city of Lille. Strauss-Kahn has been formally warned by French authorities that he is under investigation for ""aggravated pimping,"" and has been released on 100,000-euro bail. CNN's Simon Rushton contributed to this report.","Dominique Strass-Kahn was head of the International Money Fund .

"(EW.com) -- It was last fall when EW originally broke the news that pop superstar Gloria Estefan would be appearing on ""Glee"" as Santana's mother, Maribel Lopez. Now, Estefan is finally making her first appearance in the season finale! Sadly, Gleeks, the singer won't be carrying a tune in the episode, fittingly titled ""Goodbye,"" which finds McKinley's seniors graduating. ""I don't sing on the show but I kinda think that's better because I think that would throw fans,"" says Estefan. ""Hopefully, we can come back and do the singing. But I love to be on there and establishing a character."" EW talked to Estefan about her character's relationship with Santana as well as her favorite ""Glee"" number of all time -- the answer may surprise you! Entertainment Weekly: How did this come about? Gloria Estefan: First, we went to visit the set on the last season. My son lived out in LA and we were visiting. We were all a big fans so we finagled our way on the set. EW: Did you guys wear disguises? Estefan: No no! We were in the same room. I met Naya Rivera and I met Chris [Colfer] and Kevin McHale. I know Emilio had been talking with the music people on the show and stuff about different things. But then Ryan [Murphy] reached out to me to play Santana Lopez's mom and I was thrilled because I think it was a great opportunity after what the grandma did to do something supportive. EW: You mentioned this but obviously Santana came out to her grandmother and it did not go well. Estefan: No not at all! EW: So is your character more accepting? Estefan: Yes. I'm very supportive of my daughter. You always have to have a back story even if you have one line. So my back story with Santana's mom was she didn't get to go to college so she really wants Santana to do that. Up until now Santana has had a good relationship with her grandmother, but when she confronted her the response was very hard. She was probably the same way with Maribel. Santana's dad they mentioned was a doctor, so I think she helped put him through school, but decided for motherhood. [She] loved to sing and was a singer and put her life on hold because she thought being a mom was very important so she wants Santana to make it through. She's supportive of her daughter. She just wants her to be happy -- bottom line. I know the feeling because my daughter is getting ready to do her last year of high school and she's gonna do a summer program. It's the first time we're all going to be separated. I'm there! It was a very hard thing for me to imagine. EW: How's the chemistry between you and Naya? Did you all get along like gangbusters from the start? Estefan: Yes. From day one. She was so sweet when we met on the set. She was really really nice and sweet. I thought we fell into the roles well. She was fun to be around. EW: It sounds like you have scenes with Heather Morris, too. Estefan: Yes we did. We had a scene at Breadstix. I had to ask for a booster chair [laughs]. EW: That must have been fun to be at such an iconic ""Glee"" location? Estefan: It was fun. There's some very funny stuff with Heather Morris. It was a fun scene and it's also poignant and there's a scary moment there for the mom. EW: Did your family come to watch the shoot? Estefan: Yes. My husband and my daughter. My husband said to me, ""You know what? You're my wife but when you hugged her, I got choked up."" I know he's probably feeling the same thing because of [our daughter] Emily . I go, ""That's a good sign!"" [laughs] . EW: Why do the Estefans love ""Glee"" so much? Estefan: I'll tell you what I love: I'm a musician first and foremost. Music has been a really big and healing part of my life. I studied psychology so I tend to analyze a lot of things. But if you go back to WWII, you had musicals and happy things and escapist things because that's what entertainment does -- it takes you away. You couldn't have done this before because we were all too cheeky back in the '80s and '90s and would have snubbed our noses at something so whimsical. Now, people need it! It's fun. Great music.

"(CNN) -- The midair collision of two small planes about 50 miles from Washington is under investigation by Canadian officials because one plane was owned by an FAA employee and the other by an NTSB employee, federal officials said Tuesday. On Monday afternoon, a Piper PA-28 registered to a Federal Aviation Administration employee and a Beechcraft BE-35 owned by a National Transportation Safety Board employee collided in flight above Fauquier County, Virginia, authorities said. The pilot and a passenger of the BE-35 were killed, but the owner and pilot of the PA-28 survived with injuries, authorities said. NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman consulted with FAA Acting Administrator Michael Huerta and requested the Transportation Safety Board of Canada investigate the incident, she said in a statement Tuesday. ""This accident hits especially close to home, with the involvement of an NTSB employee,"" Hersman said. ""I'm grateful to TSB-Canada Chair Wendy Tadros for agreeing to conduct the investigation and the NTSB stands ready to support and assist them in any way we can."" An NTSB investigator will serve as a U.S. liaison to Canadian investigators, authorities said. The midair collision happened about five miles south of the Warrenton-Fauquier Airport around 4 p.m. Monday. ""One plane has been destroyed by fire,"" Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said on Monday. ""In that plane, which is believed to be a six-seater aircraft, two bodies have been recovered. State police are in the process of identifying the pilot and passenger.""

"(CNN) -- World soccer's governing body FIFA has nominated the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, to be its lead anti-corruption investigator, FIFA said Tuesday. The Argentinian prosecutor is best known for pursuing war crimes charges against Libya's late Moammar Gadhafi and the president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir. Moreno-Ocampo's term with the ICC ends in June. News of his nomination comes a day after police in Italy arrested at least 19 people, including Lazio team captain Stefano Mauri, in connection with a match-fixing investigation -- the latest scandal to plague international soccer. Allegations of corruption also rocked FIFA's governing body last year. Asian football chief Mohamed bin Hammam was banned from the game for life after being found guilty of corruption for trying to buy votes in the FIFA presidential election with $40,000 in cash inducements to Caribbean football officials last year. Also, the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, respectively won by Russia and Qatar, came under scrutiny after allegations of improper conduct. In March, FIFA pledged to reform its governance structure to address concerns about corruption. The proposed changes included splitting the organization's ethics committee into two entities, one to investigate allegations and another to rule on them.","FIFA nominates Luis Moreno-Ocampo to lead its anti-corruption unit .

"New York (CNN) -- A teenage stock clerk who in 1979 left Manhattan for the solace of his mother's south Jersey home appeared shaken and then fell ill, says a relative of the man now charged in the murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz. ""When he moved home, he was really nervous and shaking all the time,"" added the relative, who declined to be named. ""He constantly had diarrhea, and he spent a lot of time just looking out the window."" Etan Patz disappeared that same year after walking to a school bus in Lower Manhattan, the first time he'd walked to the bus alone. The boy's plight catapulted concern for missing children to the national forefront after authorities splashed his image across thousands of milk cartons. It's not clear whether Pedro Hernandez -- described by police as an off-the-books former stock boy turned 51-year-old murder suspect -- was ever interviewed in the initial case. But more than three decades after Etan vanished, authorities say Hernandez confessed to the boy's killing after being brought in for questioning last week. Hernandez has since been charged with second degree murder and is currently awaiting trial. But attorney Harvey Fishbein said his client -- who is currently on suicide watch at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan -- has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation. According to police, the former stock clerk claims he lured Etan to the store's basement with the promise of a soda before choking him to death. He then allegedly disposed of the body using a plastic bag, placing the boy inside a trash bin located a block and a half away from his work. ""The detectives thought (that confession) was a feeling of relief on his part,"" said Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who described Hernandez as remorseful. Prosecutors are now confronted with the task of corroborating that confession and piecing together a murder mystery that for decades has been littered with false positives. The image of Hernandez, meanwhile, has gradually come into focus as attention homes in on the reclusive suspect who, according to his attorney, apparently suffers from a ""long psychiatric history"" that includes schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hallucinations. The Hernandez family -- a large clan consisting of 11 brothers and sisters -- moved from Puerto Rico to southern New Jersey in the early 1970s, a relative told CNN. Pedro Hernandez attended high school in the Camden, New Jersey, area before moving to Manhattan at the age of 18, sharing an apartment in the city's SoHo neighborhood with his older sister. Sometime after his 19th birthday, Hernandez took a job as a stock clerk at a corner convenience store. He worked in the Lower Manhattan bodega for roughly a month before returning to his mother's south Jersey home in the summer of 1979, according to family members and police. Etan disappeared roughly a month earlier on May 25. Describing Hernandez as having been a quiet young man, relatives say his demeanor changed upon his return to New Jersey. He grew further withdrawn while also frequently becoming ill, they said. Though his whereabouts after 1979 remain murky, family members say at one point he returned to New York. It's unclear for how long. Police Commissioner Kelly told reporters last week that Hernandez was injured during a construction job sometime in the 1990s and has since been receiving disability compensation. But a relative claims that the suspect was instead injured during his employment at a clothing factory in Maple Shade, New Jersey. Twice married, Hernandez fathered a daughter and settled down with a woman named Rosemary, his second wife, who relatives say had always had a crush on him. But financial troubles followed, and the couple filed for bankruptcy in 1999, according to court documents. Still, those who claim to know Hernandez offer mixed impressions of his character. Roberto Monticello, a former SoHo resident who says he knew Hernandez in New York at the time of Etan's disappearance, described him as a ""very strange guy."" ""He was always by himself,"" Monticello recalled to CNN affiliate NY1. ""(I) never saw him with people."" His pastor, George Bowen, called him a ""very quiet, unassuming, almost shy man,"" who attended church regularly with his wife and daughter, often sitting in the same pew. ""Every Sunday morning I had a conversation with him,"" said Bowen, who described the interaction as ""more or less a greeting."" But the suspect's sister, Norma Hernandez, said their family had for years grappled with the knowledge of her brother's alleged crime. She says she once walked into a Camden police station in the early 1980s to report the murder, telling authorities that her brother confessed to killing a boy in New York and throwing the body near a dumpster. But, she says, there's no indication that anything ever came out of that report. ""You feel like they didn't believe you,"" Norma Hernandez told CNN. ""I was expecting something else."" ""Police asked whether I was mad"" at her brother or had an ulterior motive, she said. Pedro Hernandez allegedly confided in a church prayer group that included members of his family and his then-spiritual adviser, his sister said, telling them of the alleged killing. Camden police and Tomas Rivera, a leader of the prayer group, declined to comment. But Lisa Cohen, whose 2009 book, ""After Etan,"" is widely considered the definitive account of the case, said she remains skeptical about the man's confession, widely considered the signature element of his prosecution. ""I had never heard of Pedro Hernandez before this week,"" she told CNN. A separate law enforcement source said Hernandez's claims were being treated with ""a healthy dose of skepticism."" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance ultimately gave the green light to file murder charges against Hernandez, despite the absence of forensic evidence, witness testimony and lingering questions over his mental state. CNN's Ross Levitt and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","Pedro Hernandez, 51, has been charged with second degree murder .

"(CNN) -- While several European countries have long had their own versions of ""American Idol,"" the longest running televised pop music competition where fans choose their favorite songs and singers is Europe's Eurovision Song Contest, now in its 56th year. Saturday evening, Azerbaijan won the 2011 running of the annual competition, with a sweet pop song that Europe slowly fell in love with during the course of the contest, titled ""Running Scared,"" by Eldar and Nikki (also known as Ell/Nikki). The song, somewhat of a surprise winner to many, beat out early favorites from France and England to win over Italy and Sweden. Sweden's Eric Saade was winning the contest in the early going, until it became apparent that Eldar and Nikki would run away with a trophy. Ironically, Swedes Stefan Örn and Sandra Bjurman wrote Azerbaijan's song, making Saturday night a win for Sweden all around -- Saade came in third at the competition. Italy's Raphael Gualazzi was second. But the true victors Saturday were Azerbaijan's Eldar and Nikki, who seemed stunned yet ecstatic just after the ceremony. ""We're very happy right now. ... We're very proud,"" said Eldar Gasimov at a post-show press conference. The winner was determined by fans across Europe who voted by phone, and a jury made up of music industry professionals. Saturday's final capped off two weeks of fanfare surrounding the event, and followed two semifinals and a kind of dress rehearsal, a jury final, on Friday evening. Some 36,000 watched Saturday's Grand Final event live from a stadium in Dusseldorf, Germany, which was chosen as the host city for 2011 after Germany won the song competition in 2010 with Lena's ""Satellite."" It was the first time in 28 years Germany had played host to Eurovision fans. Lena, who represented Germany again in 2011 to defend her title, did not do quite as well this year, with her ""Taken By A Stranger"" placing 10th. ""Satellite"" wowed crowds last year, making Lena a star in Germany seen often on TV and on billboards. Ratings for Saturday's grand finale fared well around Europe, but within Germany, semifinal viewership was down this year, with some German newspapers citing ""Lena fatigue"" as one reason fewer Germans seemed excited in 2011 for the annual pop music contest. Conversely, interest in the annual competition spiked this year in English-speaking countries, largely due to strong contenders from both the United Kingdom (contemporary boy band Blue) and Ireland, which sent a pair of identical twins (Jedward). BBC ratings for both semifinals earlier this week nearly doubled last year's numbers. The number of English and Irish fans also seemed high Saturday night in Germany, where UK tourists swarmed Dusseldorf's arena, showing patriotism with the kind of colorful clothing usually reserved for soccer matches. Ratings for Saturday's final were also up in Spain and Austria compared with 2010 viewership, according to newspaper reports. So what's behind the enduring appeal of the Eurovision Song Contest for fans from as far away as Australia? According to John Kennedy O'Connor, who wrote ""The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History,"" it's a mix of curiosity and love of music. ""You can come at it from any angle you like,"" he said outside the arena Friday before the jury final, which precedes the actual grand final and makes up 50% of the vote determining who wins the annual competition. ""One can watch it to see how appallingly bad the talent will be, or one can watch it to see how good it's going to be. ... Neither of those opinions is invalid,"" he said. ""It's an entertainment show."" And the entertainment was there during Saturday's Grand Final, with production values approaching something like a U2 concert -- think state-of-the-art indoor pyrotechnics and lighting displays tailored to each individual country's stage set. While many Americans were unaware the competition took place this past week, the United States did have a stake in the game, via a few U.S.-based songwriters, who were likely watching online Saturday, awaiting results. Los Angeles-based songwriters in particular were paying attention. Gus Seyffert and Nicole Morier wrote Lena's ""Taken By A Stranger,"" while Beverly Hills' Bryan Todd co-wrote TWiiNS' ""I'm Still Alive"" for Slovakia. But the biggest L.A.-based name who generated interest in Eurovision this year was Lady Gaga producer RedOne. The songsmith co-wrote Russia's entry for 2011, Alex Sparrow's ""Get You,"" which didn't fare as well Saturday night as many had hoped, yet still impressed many. ""The universal language is music,"" the songwriter said from a private pressroom before the event Saturday night, after a crush of Russian photographers snapped pictures of him and Sparrow together. ""All the borders are falling away (because of the Internet),"" said the hitmaker, currently riding high on world pop charts with his and J-Lo's hot ""On The Floor."" ""Songwriting has no boundaries,"" he added, noting he had been tweeting about his newly signed Russian artist, Sparrow, who performed in the finals Saturday. ""I grew up watching Eurovision,"" said the producer, who lived in Sweden before immigrating to America. So will Americans care next year about a televised song competition which doesn't air in the U.S.? RedOne, for one, hopes so. ""It's a beautiful contest because it's all about the songs and the artists,"" he said. ""It's like 'Idol,' but with original songs. Americans should really get into it.""","Eldar and Nikki of Azerbaijan win with sweet pop song ""Running Scared""

"(CNN) -- To get a sense of how Ron Paul is tying the GOP establishment in knots, look no further than Sen. Jim DeMint, the powerful Republican from the site of the next major primary, South Carolina. Until November 2010, DeMint had a clear claim on being the most influential, populist-flavored fiscal conservative in the Senate. Then a wave of Tea Party freshmen helped bring a Republican majority to the House of Representative and a new breed of politician to the Senate -- one best exemplified by Kentucky's Rand Paul, whose post-campaign memoir was titled The Tea Party Goes to Washington. DeMint, a strong social conservative, greeted it with both a hearty welcome (""[P]ut on your boxing gloves. The fight begins today"") and an attempt at line-drawing. ""You can't be a fiscal conservative,"" he claimed just after the election, ""and not be a social conservative."" DeMint was totally wrong about that -- polling data has indicated that a majority of Americans feel comfortable with the label of ""fiscally conservative and socially liberal"" -- but that's not what's interesting here. What's interesting is that after pooh-poohing the existence of a species that closely resembles the politically homeless tribe known as libertarians, DeMint, in the wake of Rep. Ron Paul's solid second-place showing so far in the GOP presidential primary season, is using the L-word as a compliment. ""One of the things that's hurt the so-called conservative alternative is saying negative things about Ron Paul,"" DeMint told radio host Laura Ingraham this week. ""I'd like to see a Republican Party that embraces a lot of the libertarian ideas."" This is a departure. In both 2000 and 2008, the top two GOP delegate-winners ran on explicitly anti-libertarian platforms. As John McCain wrote in his campaign memoir ""Worth the Fighting For,"" ""I welcomed a greater, if still limited, role for government in national problems, anathema to the 'leave us alone' libertarian philosophy that dominated Republican debates in the 1990s. So did George W. Bush, I must add, who challenged libertarian orthodoxy with his appeal for a 'compassionate conservatism.'"" The mix of compassionate conservatism, with its emphasis on domestic spending initiatives such as No Child Left Behind and the Medicare Part D, and neo-conservatism, with its emphasis on interventionist foreign policy, produced results that were both predictable and predictably repellent to libertarians: A 60% increase in federal nondefense spending under Bush, and a federal government that recognized no corner of the globe or hospital room as off-limits to American police power. It's no wonder, then, that libertarians, like the rest of America, have been fleeing the Republican Party in droves. From 1972 to1988, libertarians voted Republican for president 69 percent of the time; since then the percentage has dropped to 46. Meanwhile the country, and especially younger people, have been turning more culturally libertarian on issues like gay marriage and marijuana prohibition, at a time when the mainstream GOP keeps fighting those lost causes. Mitt Romney is on the glide path to the Republican nomination. But it is not escaping GOP notice that Romney's vote total in Iowa was the same as it was in 2008, and just 5 percentage points higher in New Hampshire than four years previous. Turnout among self-identified Republicans decreased in both states, even after more than three years of Barack Obama's misgovernance. Ron Paul, on the other hand, more than doubled his vote total in Iowa, and tripled it in New Hampshire, largely by attracting nearly half of all independents and young voters. Paul has gotten twice as many votes as Newt Gingrich so far. In the Granite State, he received more votes than Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Rick Perry combined. And unlike Santorum and Gingrich (his two main competitors for the non-Romney slot at this point), Paul has a nationwide campaign, the ability to raise money at the drop of a hat, and the clear intention to compete all the way to the Republican National Convention. He is the clear front-runner in the race for second place. What are poor Republicans to do? Many of them hate Ron Paul's ideas on foreign policy, roll their eyes at his talk about the Federal Reserve, deem him to be several fries short of a Happy Meal, and -- correctly -- see his constitutional radicalism as a threat to both the philosophies behind compassionate conservatism and neo-conservatism, and to the practical gravy train of bipartisan big government. But he's the only Republican game in town when it comes to drawing in the independents and young voters they need. DeMint, for one, is making a partial accommodation, by saying nice things about Paul and refusing to endorse any candidate (though his staff is another story). ""I don't agree with Ron Paul on foreign policy and his disengagement around the world, but we're going to end up where he is because we don't have any money,"" DeMint told The Daily Caller. ""So the Republican Party needs to become the big tent of Americans who really want freedom, prosperity, opportunity and that's just synonymous with a more limited government."" But if the campaign comes down to a two-man race, you can expect some serious evictions from the GOP's shrinking tent. Buy popcorn.

"Moorestown, New Jersey (CNN) -- Rosemary Hernandez was going through hard times, coping with financial woes after recently losing her job at an insurance company, all that coming years after an accident left her husband unable to work. Yet it was something else entirely on her mind when she and her daughter came weeping into their Moorestown, New Jersey, church Thursday, according to their pastor. ""I knew it was something bad,"" Marantha Christian Fellowship church Senior Pastor George Bowen told CNN on Sunday. Hernandez told Bowen that police came to her door the previous day, saying their visit had ""something to do with the Etan Patz case."" The 6-year-old boy's sudden disappearance a block from his Manhattan home on May 25, 1979, spawned a national movement to raise awareness of missing children, including the then-novel approach of putting an image of the child's face on milk cartons. Her husband, Pedro Hernandez, ended up leaving the family home with police -- and, with his subsequent arrest, he hasn't returned. ""She seemed absolutely shell-shocked,"" Bowen recalled Sunday of his conversation three days earlier with Rosemary Hernandez. ""She was crying. She had an expression on her face like, 'How could this ever happen?'"" That same day, police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters that Pedro Hernandez had admitted -- as a then-19-year-old clerk in a Manhattan bodega -- to luring Etan to the store with the promise of a soda, choking him and placing his body in the trash about a block and a half away. The Manhattan district attorney's office charged Pedro Hernandez with second-degree murder, finding his confession credible even given that authorities concede there is no physical evidence linking him and that Patz's body has never been found. Defense lawyer Harvey Fishbein claims his client -- who is on suicide watch at New York's Bellevue Hospital, according to a law enforcement source -- has a ""long psychiatric history"" including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hallucinations. Hernandez has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation. Rosemary Hernandez is Pedro Hernandez's second wife. Bowen, the New Jersey pastor, said he got the impression Pedro Hernandez never mentioned anything about the Patz case or about killing anyone to his wife, while ceding he never posed the question directly to Rosemary Hernandez. What he did know for certain was that the Hernandez family attended the church regularly. The couple faithfully sat in the second row during services, the pastor said. Rosemary Hernandez and her daughter were active in church ministries. But Pedro Hernandez, who Kelly has said had been collecting disability payments since a 1993 accident prevented him from working, was more in the background. ""He's very quiet, very shy,"" Bowen said, describing him as ""socially awkward."" The pastor said that his interactions with the husband typically consisted of brief greetings and little else. Once, the couple came to him for counseling -- for an issue he say was not related to their marriage or a crime -- and Rosemary Hernandez ""did all the talking,"" Bowen said. For this Sunday's services, Rosemary Hernandez and her daughter were not in their regular spot in the second row. But they were on Bowen's mind, as was Pedro Hernandez's alleged victim and the boy's family. ""Please pray for the Patz family, pray for Rosemary and (her daughter),"" the pastor told his congregation. ""Please pray for Pedro.""","Rosemary Hernandez visited her pastor after her husband's arrest, the pastor says .

"London (CNN) -- The Syrian poet, critic and artist Adonis has been described as the greatest living Arab poet. He was the first Arab to win the German Goethe Prize last year at the age of 81, whose judges described him as ""the most important Arab poet of our time,"" and he was one of the favorites to win last year's Nobel Prize for Literature. Adonis, born Ali Ahmad Said Esbar, grew up in a poor village near the Syrian city of Latakia and received no formal education until he was granted a scholarship to a French lycee by the then president of Syria at the age of 13. He was forced to leave Syria in 1956 after being imprisoned for his involvement in the opposition Syrian National Socialist Party. He moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and now lives in Paris and Beirut. He spoke to CNN through an interpreter at an exhibition of his collages and a series of literary events called ""A Tribute to Adonis"" at the Mosaic Rooms in London until March 30. CNN: How do you feel watching the situation in Syria? Adonis: I'm very sad. I wish that the regime would understand that it has to reform or renew itself and create a new government through free and fair elections. I also wish that the opposition had not resorted to armed violence because I'm personally against violence in all its forms. I do not see any justification for its use whatsoever. CNN: Should the outside world intervene in Syria? A: The world should not interfere, especially not militarily. The Western world should not use this as a pretext to fulfill its own goals in the region. More from Inside the Middle East: Filmmaker Nigol Bezian's tour of 'Little Armenia' in Beirut . CNN: Are you in touch with friends in Syria? A: I last went to Syria a year and a half ago, but I'm always in touch with my friends there. Many of them are in the opposition -- but in the peaceful opposition. Many of them share my views that the solution must be Syrian and through a democratic dialogue. We must reach a new regime that is democratic, plural and secular. CNN: Are your friends scared? A: Their main fear is for the violence and for the potential for the situation to develop into civil war. They are not scared to speak out. They can talk openly. CNN: How have events of the past year changed the Arab world? A: There's definitely a new consciousness everywhere. The question is will this lead to a new political reality and new regimes? It's difficult to predict, but I hope so. CNN: Have you seen changes in Lebanon, where you have lived on and off since 1956? A: Lebanon will remain as it has always been: An ongoing project, a work in progress. It's a project that's difficult to stop, but it's equally difficult to continue with. CNN: You received no formal education until you recited one of your own poems to the then Syrian president in 1943. How did that happen? A: It was almost 70 years ago after Syria became independent and the president was touring the country. I was 12 or 13 and I read a poem in front of the president. He called me over and asked what I wanted. I said I would like to go to school, so I got a scholarship to a school in Latakia. More from Inside the Middle East: Women and the Arab uprisings: 8 'agents of change' to follow . CNN: How did that change your life? A: Poetry gave me a new life. I can always say that poetry allowed me to be reborn. CNN: How important is poetry in Arab culture? A: There are two things that are central to our culture: Religion and poetry. They were always in conflict. Unfortunately now religion is overwhelming poetry, but I have a saying that poetry remains deeply-rooted and strong. Poetry has never had any influence throughout history, however poetry creates a new aesthetic, a new beauty, a new type of relations between things and people, and this is not insignificant. CNN: What was Syria like before 1970 when Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father came to power? A: I left Syria in 1956, a few years before the Baath party became the government in 1963. I was always opposed to the Baathist ideology. I was always against the one-party state. CNN: You left Syria after being imprisoned for membership of an opposition party in 1956, then you left Lebanon in 1982 after the Israeli invasion. Do you feel you have always been in exile? A: I don't only feel in exile because of these two departures. There are many other factors making me feel this way: Relationships with other people, my relationship with language, my relationship with the world. Love sometimes makes you feel you are in exile. Existentially, the feeling of permanence is always accompanied by a feeling of exile, of impermanence. CNN: How has Syria changed since you left? A: What's strange is I feel it is I who has changed, not the country. CNN: What are your memories of the Syria of your youth? A: I remember the coast, the mountains, the beautiful girls for which Syria is famous. I miss swimming in the sea. CNN: Will you ever go back to live in Syria? A: I would like to go back, but I don't think my desire will be fulfilled. CNN: The Mosaic Rooms in London is currently running 'A Tribute to Adonis' and an exhibition of your artwork. What does this mean to you? A: I'm very happy. There's a lot of attention and a lot of sensitive appreciation.","Adonis won German Goethe Prize and was described by judges as the ""most important Arab poet of our time""

"(CNN) -- A boiling primary battle in Texas headed to a runoff early Wednesday as two Republicans running for U.S. Senate failed to reach the 50% threshold to clinch the GOP nomination. Though Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst led the crowded field of candidates, he narrowly failed to cross the 50% mark required to secure the nomination and avoid a July 31 runoff. Dewhurst's challenger in the runoff will be tea party favorite Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general with strong support from national groups and high-profile conservative leaders. With 99.6% of precincts counted, Dewhurst held 48% of the vote to 30% for Cruz. Other contenders in Tuesday's primary included former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert and ESPN Broadcaster Craig James. Neither candidate will forge ahead to compete in the runoff. The Texas race is particularly important because the balance of power in the U.S. Senate could shift in 2012. It is also another test in the staying power and influence of tea party groups and their political strategy to focus more on congressional races than on the presidential campaign. The race, held to replace retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, has seen a Texas-sized level of spending, as well. According to Federal Election Commission reports, more than $31.6 million had been dumped in the GOP primary as of May 9, with more than half coming from Dewhurst's team. While Cruz's campaign has spent more than $4 million, the underdog has been boosted by a surge of outside spending. The fiscal conservative organization Club for Growth has spent more than $2 million, and the tea party oriented FreedomWorks has also been heavy on the ground in get-out-the-vote efforts on behalf of Cruz. Members of the Tea Party Express, a leading arm of the grass-roots movement, have traversed the state by bus in support of Cruz. Adding to his rising star power, the former solicitor general landed endorsements from former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum and tea party stalwart Sarah Palin, two big voices in the conservative movement. Dewhurst, meanwhile, touts his support from 2008 presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has also been vocal for his No. 2. In a recent commercial, Perry urged voters to turn out for Dewhurst, insisting he was the true conservative in the race. Given that Perry and Dewhurst have worked together for almost a decade, some political observers characterize the race as a possible referendum on Perry, the state's longest-serving governor in history. But Perry brushed off the idea on Friday, telling CNN Chief National Correspondent John King that while national conservatives may be making noise in the race against Dewhurst, the local movement will stand for the lieutenant governor. ""There's, you know, people who come from out of state and make their endorsements known,"" Perry said. ""But Texas conservatives are lining up behind David Dewhurst."" Dewhurst opponents criticize the candidate as being part of the Republican establishment and having too many years in government under his belt. Before becoming lieutenant governor, Dewhurst served as Texas Land Commissioner in the late '90s. Hitting back, Dewhurst points to his private sector experience as the co-founder of Falcon Seaboard, an energy company based in Houston. He also boasts his role in pushing for socially conservative legislation in the state, including a recent bill that requires women to see a sonogram and go through a 24-hour waiting period before having an abortion. Dewhurst has attacked Cruz, who is of Cuban descent, as a supporter of amnesty and a member of the Hispanic Leadership Fund and the Hispanic Alliance for Prosperity Institute. Cruz has also been on the defense over criticism that he works for a firm representing a Chinese company being sued for patent violations. The candidate has repeatedly shot down both claims, arguing he has long been an opponent of illegal immigration and saying he is not the lead lawyer in the patent lawsuit. The Hispanic Leadership Fund also fired back against Dewhurst's latest ad, saying Cruz has never had any position with the group and faulted the ad as dishonest. ""The Hispanic Leadership Fund support using free market and limited government principles to strengthen border security, restore a functional legal immigration system, and promote patriotic assimilation. If David Dewhurst wants to deceitfully lump us in with leftist organizations that actually do promote amnesty, then all he is accomplishing is demonstrating to Texas voters how intellectually shallow he is,"" Mario H. Lopez, the organization's president, said in a statement. On the Democratic side, former state Rep. Paul Sadler and political operative Sean Hubbard are competing for their party's nomination. Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in more than two decades. Political handicappers Stuart Rothenberg and Charlie Cook both rate the open seat as safe for Republicans.","Lt. Gov.

"(CNN) -- The anti-abortion group Live Action released Tuesday its latest undercover video aimed at discrediting Planned Parenthood. The edited video shows a Planned Parenthood staff member apparently counseling a woman about gender-selective abortion. ""I see that you're saying that you want to terminate if it's a girl, so are you just wanting to continue the pregnancy in the meantime?"" says a counselor, identified only as Rebecca, in a Planned Parenthood clinic in Austin, Texas. The woman, purported to be in the first trimester of her pregnancy, according to Live Action, says she does not know the gender of her fetus but wants to abort if it turns out to be female. ""The abortion covers you up until 23 weeks,"" says Rebecca, ""and usually at five months is usually (sic) when they detect, you know, whether or not it's a boy or a girl."" The staffer recommends to the woman that she ""just continue and try again"" if her fetus turns out to be female. ""Good luck, and I hope that you do get your boy,"" Rebecca says. In a statement, Planned Parenthood's vice president of education, Leslie Kantor, said the staffer was in an entry-level job and is no longer working for the organization. She ""did not follow our protocol for providing information and guidance when presented with a highly unusual patient scenario,"" the statement says. The incident occurred six weeks ago and swift action was taken, Kantor adds. ""Within three days of this patient interaction, the staff member's employment was ended and all staff members at this affiliate were immediately scheduled for retraining in managing unusual patient encounters."" The statement continues, ""Gender bias is contrary to everything our organization works for daily in communities across the country. Planned Parenthood opposes racism and sexism in all forms, and we work to advance equity and human rights in the delivery of health care. Planned Parenthood condemns sex selection motivated by gender bias, and urges leaders to challenge the underlying conditions that lead to these beliefs and practices, including addressing the social, legal, economic, and political conditions that promote gender bias and lead some to value one gender over the other."" Last year, after the anti-abortion group released another undercover video that Live Action said showed staff willing to assist sex trafficking and exploitation of minors and young women, Planned Parenthood announced it would retrain more than 11,000 staff members at more than 800 centers across the United States. The secretly recorded video used a couple portraying themselves as a pimp and a prostitute who were seeking abortions for underage girls. Planned Parenthood said then that employees would be fired in cases of confirmed failure to comply with the group's procedures for situations involving endangered minors and with states' mandatory reporting laws for underage girls. After Live Action released undercover videos of four Planned Parenthood health centers in Virginia and one in New Jersey, Planned Parenthood officials fired a staff worker in the New Jersey office, but defended the others, saying they behaved professionally and appropriately reported the incidents to the U.S. Justice Department.","Video shows Planned Parenthood staffer apparently counseling a woman on gender-selective abortion .

"New York (CNN) -- Nearly eight years after Adelphia's founder was among those convicted for essentially looting the cable company, fraud victims can now get their share of a record $728 million fund, the top federal prosecutor in New York announced Monday. A news release from the office of Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, described the payout as the ""largest single distribution to victims"" in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice. It has been years in the making. Four Adelphia executives were arrested in 2002 in a case that prosecutors then described as ""one of the most elaborate and extensive corporate frauds in United States history."" At the time, Adelphia was the fifth largest cable company in the nation. Two years later, CEO and founder John Rigas was found guilty of conspiracy, securities fraud and bank fraud, among other charges, for raiding the company of hundreds of millions of dollars for his personal use. He was later sentenced to 15 years in prison. His son Timothy was found guilty of conspiracy and 15 counts of securities fraud and two counts of bank fraud. John Rigas' other son, Michael, and a fourth defendant, Michael Mulcahey, a former director of internal reporting, were found not guilty of conspiracy, and the jury failed to reach verdicts on most of the other charges against Michael Rigas. In 2005, officials announced that the then-bankrupt cable operator agreed to a deal that allowed its operators -- who cooperated with investigators -- to avoid criminal prosecution. Adelphia was officially sold off to Comcast and Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, months later. The victims fund amounted to nearly half of an estimated $1.5 billion in assets, including Adelphia stock worth about $567 million, that the Rigas family forfeited as part of a complex series of agreements announced by then U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. The U.S. attorney's office explained that in the years since that settlement was reached, officials have undertaken ""the complex process of notifying large numbers of potential victims, processing more than 13,000 petitions, verifying pecuniary losses and recommending ... distribution of the forfeited funds to the Attorney General."" About 8,500 petitions sought for a portion of the fund were granted for ""victims who suffered financial losses as a direct result of the fraud,"" according to Bharara's office.","Victims of fraud under former cable company Adelphia can now get restitution .

"(CNN) -- Arkansas authorities have arrested a woman accused of helping two murder suspects escape jail by sneaking in hacksaw blades. Officials believe that Charlene Stewart, 55, of Texarkana, passed up to four hacksaw blades to her son, Quincy Vernard Stewart, 36, Chief Deputy Duke Schofield of the Miller County Sheriff's Department said Wednesday. Schofield said Charlene Stewart was arrested late Tuesday and is in a Texarkana jail facing felony charges of furnishing prohibited articles and implements of escape. Her son is one of two murder suspects who escaped the Miller County jail in Texarkana early Monday. A search of their cell showed that Quincy Stewart and Cortez Rashod Hooper, 23, apparently used a hacksaw to cut through metal bars covering a 1-by-3.5-foot window, then broke the glass to gain access to an outside courtyard, authorities have said. Two mattresses were pushed through the broken window in an effort to soften the detainees' landing. ""We cannot talk about how she got the hacksaw blade by our guards and into the system,"" Schofield said Wednesday. And authorities haven't figured out how the two managed to get outside a 10-foot fence topped with razor wire. A police K-9 unit was brought in but failed to track the men. Hooper, who is about 5 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds, is charged with first-degree murder and aggravated assault, said county dispatcher Vanessa Schaeffer. Quincy Stewart, who is 5-foot-7 and weighs 169 pounds, was being held on a capital murder charge from Bowie County, Texas, and also is charged with possession of a controlled substance. CNN's Rick Martin contributed to this report.","The mother of a murder suspect is accused of helping him escape jail, a deputy says .

"(CNN) -- A web editor in Thailand has been convicted of hosting posts on a website critical of the country's revered monarchy. Chiranuch Premchaiporn was found guilty for allowing content prohibited under Thailand's controversial ""lese-majeste"" law to stay on Prachatai, an independent online news site, for 20 days before it was deleted. ""As a web master you cannot deny your role of policing the content,"" Judge Kampol Rungrat told her at the trial in Bangkok Wednesday. She was fined 20,000 baht (US$628) and given an eight-month prison sentence -- suspended for a year pending her good behavior. The court cut the original one-year sentence because of her ""useful"" testimony to the court. Chiranuch had faced 10 charges under the 2007 Computer Crime Act -- which includes lese-majeste offenses -- for statements posted by others on Prachatai between April and November 2008. She could have faced 20 years in jail. ""The verdict is acceptable but I cannot say I'm totally satisfied as I'm still being convicted,"" she told CNN by phone after the verdict. She said she would consult with lawyers before deciding whether to appeal. Meanwhile, a petition signed by 27,000 people proposing a reform of the strict lese-majeste law was this week handed to the Thai parliament. According to The Campaign Committee for the Amendment of Section 112 of the Criminal Code, the petition aims to sponsor a bill to prevent abuse of the current law. Panel calls for overhaul of royal law . International rights groups such as Human Rights Watch believe the law criminalizes the expression of peaceful opinions. ""Thailand's lese-majeste laws are being overused and abused,"" said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at HRW. ""The government's assault on internet service providers sends a chilling message to webmasters and internet companies that they either censor other people's content or face severe penalties."" Earlier this month, a 61-year-old man serving a 20-year sentence for lese-majeste and computer offenses died in a prison hospital in Bangkok. Ampon Tangnoppakul, also known as Uncle SMS, was jailed last November for sending text messages with offensive content, the Bangkok Post reported. His death provoked outrage among many in Thailand. According to the Post, hundreds of protesters from the red-shirt movement -- generally loyal to ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- placed funeral wreaths, red roses and lilies at the hospital. At the city's criminal court, they tied black ribbons on fences to protest against his jail term. Various banners condemning lese-majeste, or Section 112 of the Criminal Code, were also flown.

"(CNN) -- A significant number of investors are preparing to confront the management of UBS on Thursday by voting against the Swiss bank's 2011 pay award and denying executives formal approval of their actions. The bank's share price dropped 28 per cent last year and it lost $2.25bn in a rogue trade in London that caused the largest unauthorised trading loss on record in Britain. For the same period, the bank chose to pay 12 members of its executive board SFr70.1m ($77.1m) compared to SFr91m in the year before. That has prompted advisory groups and institutional investors including ISS, Ethos, F&C and Hermes Equity Ownership Services to rebel against what they see as a lack of disclosure on how pay is calculated and a high proportion of variable pay. George Dallas, director of corporate governance at F&C Management, which owns a 0.2 per cent stake in the bank, said: ""UBS's bonus pool for its executive board is still too high given the trading scandal, decreasing profits and a drop in market value in the past year."" CNNMoney: Occupy boardroom: Shareholders revolt . Natacha Dimitrijevic, head of European corporate governance at Hermes which represents 25 clients with a combined stake of 0.15 per cent, said it was worried about a lack of specific performance criteria for UBS bonuses. ""Without assurances that large discretionary payouts can't occur we cannot vote in favour of the pay scheme,"" she said. Although the exact voting intentions of shareholders will not be clear until the annual meeting, some investors say they expect the bank to face a more forceful vote than at fellow Swiss group Credit Suisse, where more than a third who voted refused to back its pay award. The discontent among UBS shareholders also goes beyond the recent upsurge in investor activism expressed in non-binding votes on pay at other big banks including Citigroup and Barclays. A large number of shareholders are expected to refuse to give management a clean bill of health for 2011 because of the trading scandal and UBS's admission that the incident revealed ""shortcomings"" in its risk management. Under Swiss law, an investor forfeits most rights to sue management for actions in a given year by formally voting to ""discharge"" it of responsibility for that period. The trading scandal has triggered management changes including the replacement of chief executive Oswald Grübel by Sergio Ermotti last September. At the annual meeting, investors are being asked to elect Axel Weber, former Bundesbank president, to succeed Kaspar Villiger, outgoing chairman. Two years ago shareholders voted against discharging the former management of responsibility for 2007, the year before the credit crisis brought the bank to the brink of collapse. UBS has already been berated by a strong minority of investors over its pay structures for two consecutive years. Last year, more than a third who voted refused to back the pay report and in 2010 more than 45 per cent of investors declined to endorse it. ISS, the influential US proxy firm and Ethos, the Swiss activist investor that advises domestic pension funds both recommended their clients vote against the discharge of the management and the remuneration report. ""ISS continues to have concerns about lack of safeguards against excessive pay and poor pay practices, lack of disclosure in key areas, and certain aspects of UBS's remuneration system,"" the advisory group said in a recent note to clients.","Investors are preparing to confront the management of UBS on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Colombia's president renewed calls for rebels to release a French journalist ""as soon as possible"" Monday as online statements purportedly from leftist guerrillas provided details about his capture. ""I am very pleased to know that the French journalist is in good condition. Now that the (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) have acknowledged that they have him, I call for them to release him as soon as possible,"" President Juan Manuel Santos said. He said Colombian officials will do whatever they can to guarantee journalist Romeo Langlois' release by the rebel group, commonly known as the FARC. ""The Colombian government is willing to provide all the facilities so the release occurs as quickly as possible, but if you really want to be viewed well by the world, release him now and simply tell us where he is and we will go get him,"" Santos said during a state visit to Singapore. Langlois, who works for the France 24 television network and is a war reporter with more than 10 years experience in the country, was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group attacked on April 28, the Colombian government has said. The attack took place in the southern Caqueta province as soldiers worked to destroy cocaine labs. The Colombian president's comments Monday came as several apparent statements from the rebel group surfaced online. One statement, dated May 3 and published Sunday on a blog connected with a news agency that often publishes official statements from the FARC, criticized Langlois for wearing a military uniform and claimed that any journalists embedded with Colombian troops have been painting a biased picture. ""Romeo Langlois was wearing a military uniform of the Army in the middle of a fight. We think that the least that should be expected for the recuperation of his free mobility is the opening of a broad national and international debate about freedom of information,"" said the statement, which the New Colombian News Agency described as an official press release from the FARC. The Colombian government and military officials have said that Langlois was not wearing a full military uniform, but was wearing a helmet and a protective vest. In a YouTube video posted over the weekend, a man in military fatigues claiming to be a local FARC commander described Langlois as a ""prisoner of war"" and also said Langlois had been ""uniformed as a soldier and captured in plain combat."" In that statement, the purported FARC commander said Langlois was ""lightly wounded in one arm. He has been given the necessary medical attention and is out of danger."" Another comment posted on Twitter Sunday and purporting to be from the rebel group said Langlois would be released soon ""safe and sound."" CNN could not independently confirm that the statements came from the FARC rebels, whose official website is no longer accessible. The leftist guerrillas have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s, and are known for holding prisoners and hostages in remote jungle camps. The statement in the YouTube video appeared to echo a statement that a woman claiming to belong to the FARC read to a group of local journalists last week. Reporters Without Borders, an international press freedom group, cited the Twitter comment in a statement Monday, saying it was ""cautiously confident that he will be freed very soon."" ""It is absurd that the guerrillas consider him a combatant and in the same sense a prisoner of war. What a combatant does is armed, and Romeo Langlois never had a weapon in this circumstance, and for that very reason holding him is absurd,"" said Ignacio Gomez, director of the Bogota-based Free Press Foundation. France 24 reported last month that its editors were working with authorities in Colombia and France to gather information on the journalist. ""We know that it's a difficult region,"" said Nahida Nakad, editorial director of Audiovisuel Exterieur de la France, of which France 24 is a part, the television network reported. ""Of course we are very worried, but we have every confidence in Romeo, who knows the territory very well and is an experienced journalist. We hope that he is safe and sound, and we are in constant contact with his family."" Kidnapping government forces and civilians has been a key strategy of the rebel group. Dramatic rescues, escapes and hostage handovers have revealed harsh conditions in jungle camps, including stories of prisoners chained to trees, grueling marches between hideouts, torrential rain and blistering sun. While severely weakened in recent years, the rebels have continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. Last month, the FARC released a group of 10 members of the military and police that it said were its last government hostages. In February, the FARC also said it would stop kidnapping civilians for money. The rebels did not address the fate of its civilian captives then, nor did it renounce kidnapping for political purposes. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Esprit Smith in Atlanta and journalist Jorge Asdrubal Garcia Romero in Bogota contributed to this report.","Officials say Romeo Langlois has been missing since an April 28 rebel attack .

"(Financial Times) -- Michael Woodford, the whistleblowing ex-chief executive of Olympus, will seek up to $60m of compensation from his former company at an employment tribunal hearing scheduled to start on Monday in east London. The hearing has been postponed until midday, however, which could allow time for the two parties to settle. The British executive is claiming unfair dismissal and discrimination after he was sacked just two weeks after becoming chief executive in October. Mr Woodford's removal from his job came after he raised concerns that eventually led to the exposure of a Â¥130bn ($1.6bn) accounting scandal at the Japanese maker of optical equipment. Mr Woodford is expected to sue for up to 10 years of lost earnings. At the time of his dismissal, he had almost four years to run on his contract. The hearing is scheduled to last five days and will hinge in part on whether Mr Woodford's dismissal falls within the London tribunal's jurisdiction. If unsuccessful, Mr Woodford could sue for defamation in the High Court of England and Wales, or launch proceedings against Olympus for breach of contract in Japan. Mr Woodford initially campaigned to be reinstated as chief executive, before announcing plans to take legal action against Olympus in January. The Japanese camera maker has struggled to draw a line under the scandal. Shares in Olympus fell by more than 80 per cent in the weeks following its disclosure and are still less than half their pre-scandal levels. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Michael Woodford, the whistleblowing ex-chief executive of Olympus, will seek up to $60M .

"Washington (CNN) -- There were smiles, laughter and tears -- but little politics -- when former Presidents George W. Bush and his father, George H. W. Bush, joined current President Barack Obama at the White House for the unveiling Thursday of the younger Bush's official portrait. An emotional ceremony in the East Room saw the new White House residents thanking their predecessors for their service to the nation and for helping them out during the move more than three years ago. In personal tributes to the 43rd president and his wife, Laura, both Obama and the first lady expressed their appreciation for the example set by the Bush family during their eight years in the White House and the guidance and help provided during the transition. ""George, you went out of your way, to make sure the transition to new administration was as seamless as possible,"" Obama said, adding: ""I'll always be grateful for that."" He also cited Bush's strength and resolve that reassured the nation after the September 11 terrorist attacks, and made sure to note that anti-terrorism efforts started in the Bush administration helped bring the signature national security achievement of Obama's presidency so far -- the killing of Osama bin Laden. Opinion: Will history be kind to Bush? The tone was markedly different from Obama's campaign themes that blame the Bush administration for leaving the nation in economic shambles. However, Obama mentioned the economic turmoil at the time of the transition, saying that was a reason he especially appreciated Bush's efforts to help make it as smooth as possible. ""After three-and-a-half years in office and more gray hair, I have a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by the men before me, including President Bush,"" Obama said, adding that one truth is you can't make everybody happy. ""I think that's something President Bush and I learned pretty quickly,"" Obama continued, later noting that ""we may have our differences politically, but the presidency transcends those differences."" Both Bush and Mrs. Bush, who also had her official portrait unveiled, thanked the Obamas for their hospitality in hosting the event that included lunch with the Bush family -- including both former presidents and first ladies as well as former first daughters Jenna and Barbara. They also made a point of thanking the White House and administration staff during their eight years in Washington, and cracked jokes that caused the packed East Room to erupt in laughter. ""Thank you so much for inviting our rowdy friends to my hanging,"" Bush said after shouting ""sit down"" to cut off a lengthy standing ovation when it was his turn to speak. Bush quipped that he hoped the president will find reassurance because, when walking the White House halls at night mulling over a major problem, ""you'll now be able to gaze at this portrait and ask 'What would George do?' "" Mrs. Bush also drew a big laugh when she said in reference to the new paintings that ""nothing makes a house a home like having portraits of its former occupants staring down at you."" In the most emotional moment, Bush's voice cracked a little as he said of his father -- the nation's 41st president -- that he was honored the portrait would be ""hanging near a man who gave me the greatest gift possible, unconditional love, and that would be No. 41."" When Michelle Obama rose to speak, she began by saying: ""I don't think we have enough tissue to go around."" ""Jenna and Barbara, they're just a mess,"" she added in reference to the Bush daughters. The Obamas made a point of thanking the Bush girls for guidance they provided the Obama daughters, with Obama noting his two girls have followed the advice to make loyal friends and slide down the bannisters. The portraits by John Howard Sanden show Bush standing in the Oval Office, while Mrs. Bush, wearing a midnight blue gown, is in the Green Room that she helped refurbish.

"(CNN) -- The more familiar something looks, the less threatening it seems. This is why images of funny-looking college students marching up Broadway or shirtless boys banging on drums comprise the bulk of the imagery we see of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Stockbrokers look on, police man the barricades and what appears to be a traditional protest movement carries on another day, week or month. But Occupy is anything but a protest movement. That's why it has been so hard for news agencies to express or even discern the ""demands"" of the growing legions of Occupy participants around the nation, and even the world. Just like pretty much everyone else on the planet, occupiers may want many things to happen and other things to stop, but the occupation is not about making demands. They don't want anything from you, and there is nothing you can do to make them stop. That's what makes Occupy so very scary and so very promising. It is not a protest, but a prototype for a new way of living. Now don't get me wrong. The occupiers are not proposing a world in which we all live outside on pavement and sleep under tarps. Most of us do not have the courage, stamina or fortitude to work as hard as these people are working, anyway. (Yes, they work hard.) The urban survival camps they are setting up around the world are a bit more like showpieces, congresses and ""beta"" tests of ideas and behaviors the rest of us may soon be implementing in our communities, and in our own ways. The occupiers are actually forging a robust micro-society of working groups, each one developing new approaches -- or reviving old approaches -- to long-running problems. In just one example, Occupy's General Assembly is a new, highly flexible approach to group discussion and consensus building. Unlike parliamentary rules that promote debate, difference and decision, the General Assembly forges consensus by ""stacking"" ideas and objections much in the fashion that computer programmers ""stack"" features. The whole thing is orchestrated through simple hand gestures (think commodities exchange). Elements in the stack are prioritized, and everyone gets a chance to speak. Even after votes, exceptions and objections are incorporated as amendments. This is just one reason why occupiers seem incompatible with current ideas about policy demands or right vs. left. They are not interested in debate (or what Enlightenment philosophers called ""dialectic"") but consensus. They are working to upgrade that binary, winner-takes-all, 13th century political operating system. And like any software developer, they are learning to ""release early and release often."" Likewise, occupiers have embraced the Internet access solutions of the Free Network Foundation, who have erected ""Freedom Towers"" at the Occupy sites in New York, Austin and elsewhere through which people can access free, uncensored, authenticated Wi-Fi. As this technology scales to our own communities, what happens to corporate Internet service providers is anyone's guess. The occupiers have formed working groups to take on myriad social and economic issues, and their many occupation sites serve to test the approaches they come up with. One group is developing a complementary currency for use, initially, within the network of Occupy communities. Its efficacy will be tested and strengthened by occupiers providing one another with goods and services before it is rolled out to the world at large. Another working group is pushing to have people withdraw their money from large corporate banks on November 5 and move it instead to local banks or cooperatively owned credit unions. Whether or not we agree that anything at all in modern society needs to be changed, we must at least come to understand that the occupiers are not just another political movement, nor are they simply lazy kids looking for an excuse not to work. Rather, they see the futility of attempting to use the tools of a competitive, winner-takes-all society for purposes that might better be served through the tools of mutual aid. This is not a game that someone wins, but rather a form of play that is successful the more people get to play, and the longer the game is kept going. They will succeed to the extent that the various models they are prototyping out on the pavement trickle up to those of us working on solutions from the comfort of our heated homes and offices. For as we come to embrace or even consider options such as local production and commerce, credit unions, unfettered access to communications technology and consensus-based democracy, we become occupiers ourselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff : Occupy Wall Street not protest as much as protoype for new way of living .

"London (CNN) -- The British Supreme Court on Wednesday denied Julian Assange's appeal against extradition to Sweden over sexual abuse allegations, but the judges left open a surprise avenue for the WikiLeaks founder to fight on. Assange will take it, his legal team said, arguing that the judges made their decision based on issues that were not argued in court. Assange has been fighting for a year and a half against being sent to Sweden for questioning about accusations of sexual abuse. Two women in Sweden accused Assange in August 2010 of sexually assaulting them during a visit to the country in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. The Supreme Court appeared Wednesday to clear the way for him to be sent to Sweden for questioning, then unexpectedly gave his legal team two weeks to file an appeal. Assange lawyer Gareth Pierce said after the hearing that he would request a new hearing. ""The majority of the judges decided that custom and practice of the European community in effect trumped the law,"" she said. That ""was not argued in court and that in itself would be a breach of the (European Convention on Human Rights) Article 6 guarantee to a fair hearing."" It is very unusual for the court to grant permission to appeal its rulings, which are supposed to be final in Britain. WikiLeaks' work is not at issue in the extradition hearing or the Swedish allegations against Assange. Assange has not been charged with a crime, but Swedish prosecutors want to question him in connection with allegations of ""unlawful coercion and sexual misconduct including rape,"" according to a Supreme Court document. Assange, who has been under house arrest in Britain since December 2010, maintains he is innocent and claims that the allegations are politically motivated. He fears that if he is extradited to Sweden, authorities there could hand him over to the United States, where he then could be prosecuted for his leaking of classified documents. In a tweet Tuesday, WikiLeaks connected Wednesday's judgment with the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Sweden, which is scheduled a few days later. ""Hiliary Clinton and State Dept team arrive Stockhom June 3-4; 4 days after Assange extradition decision. Fanciful to think no discussion,"" the tweet read, misspelling both the first name of the cabinet official and of the Swedish capital. Clinton is due to make a stop in Stockholm, according to a statement on the State Department website, on a swing through six countries. Discussions about Internet freedom are included on the agenda. Assange's lawyers fought the extradition on appeal via a legal technicality involving the arrest warrant. They argued that the ""European Arrest Warrant"" issued for Assange is invalid because it was issued by a Swedish prosecutor, whom they say is not an independent and impartial judicial authority. His lawyers earlier vowed to take their fight all the way to the European Court of Human Rights if the Supreme Court denies the appeal. Two women Assange had sexual relations with in Sweden in August 2010 subsequently went to police, who took down their complaints, according the Britain's Supreme Court. Police then interviewed Assange. The WikiLeaks founder left Sweden ""in ignorance of the fact that a domestic arrest warrant had been issued for him,"" according to the U.K. high court. A Swedish court granted a warrant for his ""detention for interrogation,"" and Swedish prosecutors issued a European Arrest Warrant for his detention in the U.K. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published some 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, causing embarrassment to the government and others. It has also published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the organization has come under financial pressure, leading Assange to announce that WikiLeaks was temporarily stopping publication to ""aggressively fund raise"" in order to stay afloat. An announcement at the top of WikiLeaks' home page reads: ""We are forced to put all our efforts into raising funds to ensure our economic survival."" During his wait for the Supreme Court to rule on his extradition, Assange has hosted a talk show on Russian TV. ""The World Tomorrow"" appears on the Kremlin-funded, pro-Russian network Russia Today. He hosts it from the Suffolk mansion where he is under house arrest, with an electronic bracelet monitoring his movements. He has interviewed controversial figures at odds with the U.S. government including Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, which the United States considers a terrorist organization, and Ecuador's president Rafael Correa, who railed against the United States in his interview with Assange.","NEW: Assange will appeal, his legal team says .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta departed Thursday for a trip to Asia aimed at updating friends and allies about Washington's new Pacific-oriented defense strategy. It is the secretary's second trip to the region since taking office. He is expected to return late next week. Before boarding the 12-hour flight across the Pacific, Panetta spoke to about 250 civilian and military personnel at Hawaii's Camp H.M. Smith, home of the U.S. Pacific Command. Panetta told those gathered that Hawaii is a ""key point"" in the U.S. military strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. The secretary also met with the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, Adm. Sam Locklear, who plans to join Panetta for much of the trip. The first stop is Singapore, where Panetta is expected to deliver a major policy speech focusing on the role of the United States and its defense strategy in the Asia-Pacific region, according to a senior defense official who briefed reporters about the trip. ""Basically the core of what we are trying to do with the swing through Asia is to give a comprehensive account to partners and everyone in the region about what the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific will mean in practice,"" the official said Wednesday. The scheduled speech is at the International Institute for Strategic Studies' annual Shangri-La Dialogue, which covers regional defense and security issues as well as global threats like terrorism and piracy. Panetta also is scheduled to meet with military leaders from Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Australia and perhaps China. ""It's a good opportunity for the secretary to meet his counterparts, we'll have to see who the Chinese send,"" said a second senior defense official who also briefed the media. ""If the opportunity is there and the schedules can support, we welcome that opportunity, as we have in the past."" Much of the secretary's schedule at the Shangri-La Dialogue is still unclear because there will be so many officials from various Asian nations, and nailing down specific meetings is still being worked out. After Singapore, Panetta flies to Vietnam to meet with senior leaders there. ""We're going to be able to thank the Vietnamese for their continual great assistance on remains recovery and other importation issues,"" the first official said, referring to Vietnam's cooperation in finding the remains of American servicemen missing since the war there nearly 50 years ago. The United States and Vietnam have been working for 17 years on normalization of their relations, and the official says those relations are ""really healthy."" From Vietnam, the secretary plans to go to India for his last stop. He plans to spend two days there meeting with top officials in New Dehli and ""he'll be giving one major speech in India as well,"" the official said. ""India is the only country we mention in the defense strategic guidance as a partner. And we are really shifting to a point at which our defense interactions with India are becoming routine.""

"(CNN) -- Indonesia's response to a massive earthquake and a tsunami scare Wednesday highlights a critical reality: Warning systems and emergency responses have come a long way since the catastrophe of eight years ago. But there's still work to be done -- not just in Indonesia, but in some other countries throughout the region as well. Fears that Wednesday's 8.6-magnitude quake and resulting tsunami alert could bring a repeat of the 2004 disaster dissipated quickly as seismologists determined that Wednesday's events were very different and much less dangerous. In the intervening hours, Indonesia put in place many of the procedures it has worked on for years, including some practiced at a drill witnessed by CNN in 2009. ""The lesson of 2004 is something that we're not going to repeat at this stage,"" vowed Teuku Faizasyah, a spokesman for the Indonesian president's office. Speaking to CNN while evacuations were under way in parts of his country, he said the government was working ""to bring confidence among the people that the government is with them."" Residents were being evacuated from some areas and encouraged to head to higher ground quickly, and authorities were trying to get information from remote areas, he said. Later, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center lifted a tsunami watch for the entire Indian Ocean, indicating the threat had passed. ""The tsunami warning system worked well,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency. ""People reacted quickly and evacuated to higher ground. Mosques, churches helped spread the information to the public. There was panic but that's expected."" No serious casualties or major damage was reported Wednesday from the quake and the 8.2-magnitude aftershock off the coast of Sumatra. Four people were slightly injured on Simeulue Island, off the coast of Aceh, the disaster management agency spokesman said. In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that ultimately killed nearly 230,000 people in the region. ""In 2004, the quake was closer to the coast, stronger and was a different kind of earthquake,"" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. ""In 2004, the sea floor moved vertically, and this thrust displaced a lot of water, which produced the large tsunami. In this case, the plates moved more horizontally, and therefore a large tsunami was not generated."" ""Even though the epicenters were only about 200 miles (about 320 kilometers) apart, they occurred on different tectonic plates,"" CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller added. ""There are several plates that come together in this area, which is why it is so tectonically active. Today's quake occurred on the Indian plate, while the 2004 quake occurred on the Burma plate."" A 9.1-magnitude quake is 3.2 times larger, and more than 5 times stronger, than an 8.6-magnitude quake, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Tsunami warning sirens blared Wednesday in parts of Indonesia, and the other steps taken show that ""governments are more prepared,"" said CNN weather anchor Mari Ramos. ""There are sirens in place along coastal communities. There are buoys in the ocean to measure water level changes. There is better communication among government agencies, countries and the media. The word gets out much more quickly, and that helps saves lives,"" Ramos said. However, ""the number of measuring devices in the Indian Ocean is tiny compared to the Pacific. It's a start, but more are needed."" In October 2009, CNN's Dan Rivers visited the devastated Aceh region. He watched a well-organized tsunami drill, complete with droning alarms and people covered in fake blood fleeing from an imaginary wave. Authorities have built tsunami shelters that are raised high and can hold several hundred people, he said. Escape routes are marked. While it was not immediately clear how many people headed to higher ground Wednesday, some videos from the region showed people apparently leaving low-lying areas. That speaks to another important change from 2004: People are more aware of the danger. Back then, ""there was nothing,"" Rivers said. ""No one really knew what to do, no one even knew what a tsunami was."" Now, Ramos adds, ""Overall, the general population is much more aware."" The need for that awareness applies to citizens of other countries as well, said Walter Braunohler, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Thailand. ""Sadly, we did learn a lot of lessons from that (2004) natural disaster,"" he said Wednesday. ""And one of the biggest ones is that people should really keep in touch with their embassy."" Other countries in the region also reacted quickly to Wednesday's tsunami threat. Thailand issued an evacuation order for everyone along the Andaman coast Wednesday, according to state-run news agency MCOT. In the Maldives, some resorts were evacuated as a precaution, according to CNN's Erin Burnett, who was on vacation in the islands. But, she said, ""what strikes me most is essentially the lack of a warning system"" in the Maldives. Officials rely primarily on information from the U.S. Geological Survey, she said. That speaks to the problem the region still faces, Ramos said. ""The fact that the Maldives were included in the (warning center) bulletin is an improvement from 2004. But there's still a long way to go.""","NEW: The warning system worked well, Indonesia says .

"(Mental Floss) -- Memorial Day is more than just a three-day weekend and a chance to get the year's first sunburn. Here's a handy 10-pack of facts to give the holiday some perspective. The gravesite of Capt. Jesse Milton is seen in Arlington National Cemetery. 1. It started with the Civil War . Memorial Day was a response to the unprecedented carnage of the Civil War, in which some 620,000 soldiers on both sides died. The loss of life and its effect on communities throughout the North and South led to spontaneous commemorations of the dead: . • In 1864, women from Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, put flowers on the graves of their dead from the just-fought Battle of Gettysburg. The next year, a group of women decorated the graves of soldiers buried in a Vicksburg, Mississippi, cemetery. • In April 1866, women from Columbus, Mississippi, laid flowers on the graves of both Union and Confederate soldiers. It was recognized at the time as an act of healing regional wounds. In the same month, up in Carbondale, Illinois, 219 Civil War veterans marched through town in memory of the fallen to Woodlawn Cemetery, where Union hero Maj. Gen. John A. Logan delivered the principal address. The ceremony gave Carbondale its claim to the first organized, community-wide Memorial Day observance. Watch the meaning of the holiday . • Waterloo, New York., began holding an annual community service on May 5, 1866. Although many towns claimed the title, it was Waterloo that won congressional recognition as the ""birthplace of Memorial Day."" 2. General Logan made it official . Gen. Logan, the speaker at the Carbondale gathering, also was commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans. On May 5, 1868, he issued General Orders No. 11, which set aside May 30, 1868, ""for the purpose of strewing with flowers, or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion....""  Watch the history of the holiday » . The orders expressed hope that the observance would be ""kept up from year to year while a survivor of the war remains to honor the memory of his departed comrades.""  Watch military kids learn to grieve » . 3. It was first known as Decoration Day . From the practice of decorating graves with flowers, wreaths and flags, the holiday was long known as Decoration Day. The name Memorial Day goes back to 1882, but the older name didn't disappear until after World War II. Federal law declared ""Memorial Day"" the official name in 1967. 4. The holiday is a franchise . Calling Memorial Day a ""national holiday"" is a bit of a misnomer. While there are 11 ""federal holidays"" created by Congress -- including Memorial Day -- they apply only to Federal employees and the District of Columbia. Federal Memorial Day, established in 1888, allowed Civil War veterans, many of whom were drawing a government paycheck, to honor their fallen comrades with out being docked a day's pay. For the rest of us, our holidays were enacted state by state. New York was the first state to designate Memorial Day a legal holiday, in 1873. Most Northern states had followed suit by the 1890s. The states of the former Confederacy were unenthusiastic about a holiday memorializing those who, in Gen. Logan's words, ""united to suppress the late rebellion."" The South didn't adopt the May 30 Memorial Day until after World War I, by which time its purpose had been broadened to include those who died in all the country's wars. In 1971, the Monday Holiday Law shifted Memorial Day from May 30, to the last Monday of the month. Mental Floss: 10 holidays not yet exploited by Hallmark . 5. It was James Garfield's finest hour -- or maybe hour-and-a-half . On May 30, 1868, President Ulysses S. Grant presided over the first Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery -- which, until 1864, was Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's plantation. Some 5,000 people attended on a spring day which, The New York Times reported, was ""somewhat too warm for comfort."" The principal speaker was James A. Garfield, a Civil War general, Republican congressman from Ohio and future president. ""I am oppressed with a sense of the impropriety of uttering words on this occasion,"" Garfield began, and then continued to utter them. ""If silence is ever golden, it must be beside the graves of fifteen-thousand men, whose lives were more significant than speech, and whose death was a poem the music of which can never be sung."" It went on like that for pages and pages. As the songs, speeches and sermons ended, the participants helped to decorate the graves of the Union and Confederate soldiers buried in the cemetery. 6. Not even the Unknown Soldier can avoid media scrutiny these days . ""Here rests in honored glory an American soldier known but to God."" That is the inscription on the Tomb of the Unknowns, established at Arlington National Cemetery to inter the remains of the first Unknown Soldier, a World War I fighter, on November 11, 1921. Unknown soldiers from World War II and the Korean War subsequently were interred in the tomb on Memorial Day 1958. An emotional President Ronald Reagan presided over the interment of six bones, the remains of an unidentified Vietnam War soldier, on November 28, 1984. Fourteen years later, those remains were disinterred, no longer unknown. Spurred by an investigation by CBS News, the defense department removed the remains from the Tomb of the Unknowns for DNA testing. The once-unknown fighter was Air Force pilot Lt.

Vietnam vets go whole hog . On Memorial Day weekend in 1988, 2,500 motorcyclists rode into Washington, D.C., for the first Rolling Thunder rally to draw attention to Vietnam War soldiers still missing in action or prisoners of war. By 2002, the numbers had swelled to 300,000 bikers, many of them veterans. There may have been a half-million participants in 2005 in what organizers bluntly call ""a demonstration -- not a parade."" A national veterans rights group, Rolling Thunder takes its name from the B-52 carpet-bombing runs during the war in Vietnam. Rolling Thunder XXII (and you thought only Super Bowls and Rocky movies used Roman numerals) is Sunday, May 24. 8. Memorial Day has its customs . General Orders No. 11 stated that ""in this observance no form of ceremony is prescribed,"" but over time several customs and symbols became associated with the holiday. It is customary on Memorial Day to fly the flag at half staff until noon, and then raise it to the top of the staff until sunset. Taps, the 24-note bugle call, is played at all military funerals and memorial services. It originated in 1862 when Union Gen. Dan Butterfield ""grew tired of the 'lights out' call sounded at the end of each day,"" according to The Washington Post. Together with the brigade bugler, Butterfield made some changes to the tune. Not long after, the melody was used at a burial for the first time, when a battery commander ordered it played in lieu of the customary three rifle volleys over the grave. The battery was so close to enemy lines, the commander was worried the shots would spark renewed fighting. The World War I poem ""In Flanders Fields,"" by John McCrea, inspired the Memorial Day custom of wearing red artificial poppies. In 1915, a Georgia teacher and volunteer war worker named Moina Michael began a campaign to make the poppy a symbol of tribute to veterans and for ""keeping the faith with all who died."" The sale of poppies has supported the work of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 9. There is still a grey Memorial Day . Several Southern states continue to set aside a day for honoring the Confederate dead, which is usually called Confederate Memorial Day: Alabama: fourth Monday in April; Georgia: April 26; Louisiana: June 3; Mississippi: last Monday in April; North Carolina: May 10; South Carolina: May 10; Tennessee (Confederate Decoration Day): June 3; Texas (Confederate Heroes Day): January 19; Virginia: last Monday in May.

Still, don't feel too guilty about doing something frivolous, like having barbecue, over the weekend. After all, you weren't the one who instituted the Indianapolis 500 on May 30, 1911. That credit goes to Indianapolis businessman Carl Fisher. The winning driver that day was Ray Harroun, who averaged 74.6 mph and completed the race in 6 hours and 42 minutes.

Supreme Court chief justice (and former president) William Howard Taft dedicated the monument before a crowd of 50,000 people, segregated by race, and which included a row of Union and Confederate veterans. Also attending was Lincoln's surviving son, Robert Todd Lincoln. And in 2000, Congress established a National Moment of Remembrance, which asks Americans to pause for one minute at 3 p.m. in an act of national unity.

"(CNN) -- Three quarters of the world's poor are living without a bank account, impeded by physical distance from banks and by bureaucratic roadblocks, according to a World Bank report. In a 2011 survey of 150,000 adults in 148 countries, it found that more than 75% of adults earning less than $2 per day are ""unbanked"" or do not use a formal financial institution. Of 70,000 respondents without a bank account, 65% cited not having enough money to use one as the most important reason. Other top reasons included the cost of opening a bank account being too expensive and a lack of trust in banks. ""I hope policy makers will use this research to help make sure everyone, everywhere, has access to financial services,"" Her Royal Highness Princess MÃ¡xima of the Netherlands and the UN Secretary General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development said in a news release. Among regions surveyed, people in the Middle East and North Africa have most difficulties, with only 18% reporting an account. In high-income economies, nine out of 10 adults have an account at a formal financial institution. Being 'unbanked' is linked to inequalities, according to The World Bank. The richest 20% of adults in developing countries are more than twice as likely to have an account as the poorest 20%. Also, in developing economies only 37% of women have a bank account compared with 46% of men keeping their savings in financial institutions. A bank account could enhance economic opportunities among the poor, as saving and borrowing enables them to start a business or invest in education. Instead, they often rely on money lenders charging high fees, the World Bank says. ""Providing financial services to the 2.5 billion people who are 'unbanked' could boost economic growth and opportunity for the world's poor,"" says World Bank Group President Robert B. Zoellick. Mobile banking is becoming a popular alternative to money lenders among the poor, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. These money transfers through mobile phones enable them to pay bills or make deposits through a text message without traveling or setting up a formal bank account. Mobile banking is especially popular in Kenya, where about 7 in 10 adults have access to mobile money services, according to Safaricom, a leading mobile network provider that offers money transfers via text messaging through its M-Pesa service. The world's poorest live in the Sub-Saharan Africa region, with almost 70% of adults living on less than $2 a day. In South Asia, almost 60%of people and just over 50% in Middle East and North Africa live on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank Report.","75% of the world's poor do not have a bank account, a World Bank report says.
Among the reasons are a lack of money and required documentation to open one and travel distance.

"(CNN) -- When most Americans think about heroic efforts that save lives and keep communities safe from gun violence, I suspect they picture someone with a badge, gun or bullet-proof vest who, with similarly equipped colleagues, busts down doors in pursuit of criminal thugs. I salute the fine officers who arrest violent criminals, but there is another kind of hero dedicated to preventing homicides and shootings. CNN Heroes called attention to him, and others like him, in a recent article. In part, it recounted the story of Tard Carter, 34, of Baltimore, who is a convicted felon turned outreach worker. Carter goes into the most violent neighborhoods in Baltimore to keep people with histories of gang involvement, criminality and violence from shooting at each other. Carter and his street outreach colleagues have no weapons or means of protection other than their reputation, authenticity and skills as ""violence interrupters."" They help settle disputes peacefully, but they also are much needed role models and mentors who steer youth away from gangs and toward opportunities to live productive, crime-free lives. It sounds admirable, what these brave and committed people do. But can potential killers really be talked out of their initial violent impulses and intentions? My experience evaluating Baltimore's Safe Streets program, which aims to reduce shootings among people ages 14-25, has convinced me that the answer is definitely yes. With the support of funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, my colleagues from the Johns Hopkins Center for the Prevention of Youth Violence and I spent the past five years studying the work of outreach workers and violence interrupters like Carter, working in four Baltimore neighborhoods that have historically been among the city's most violent areas. Each of the intervention sites was in the top 10% of police posts in Baltimore for homicides and nonfatal shootings from 2003 to 2006. Three of four neighborhoods in the program experienced reductions in gun violence significantly greater than those in other high-crime neighborhoods that were not involved in the program. After outreach staff mediated numerous gang conflicts during the initial five months Safe Streets was implemented in Carter's neighborhood, the community did not have a single homicide for nearly two years. This was a feat that had not been accomplished in recent memory. (The neighborhoods had had at least three homicides a year before the program. Sometimes more.) Safe Streets replicates Chicago's CeaseFire program, in which an evaluation showed impressive reductions in gun violence in seven Chicago neighborhoods. The program saved taxpayers the costs of incarceration. A common wisdom in police enforcement has long been that cities could curb gun violence through law enforcement crackdowns on drug dealers, since so much violent crime is related to drugs. But research has shown that these efforts are actually much more likely to increase than decrease violence. Government officials have begun to realize that billions of dollars spent fighting a war on drugs has not been responsible for curbing addiction or reducing violence. Law enforcement efforts targeted at violent gun offenders are often effective and vital to keeping communities safe. But public health initiatives such as CeaseFire and Safe Streets are necessary complements to law enforcement. These programs prevent violence before it occurs in the first place. Homicide is the second leading cause of death for young people in the United States, and the leading cause of death among young black males. The social cost of gun violence in the United States has been estimated to be $100 billion annually. To save lives and reduce these costs, we must invest in effective violence prevention programs. Regrettably, some communities that have been implementing Ceasefire have seen their funding cut and programs eliminated. The CDC is an important source of funding for such programs and for the research that determines which strategies are most effective. In light of this, it is disappointing that last week the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee voted to eliminate the CDC's entire budget for youth violence prevention. This is short-sighted thinking that will keep heroes like Tard Carter -- whose job still survives -- from interrupting the cycle of violence in communities across the country and will stall progress toward an array of other efforts to prevent youth violence. Congress allocates billions of dollars to federal law enforcement against drug traffickers each year. By reallocating only a tiny fraction of those funds to continue CDC's implementation and evaluation of prevention programs, Congress could really have a positive impact on youth violence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Webster.","Tard Carter is Baltimore outreach worker who helps settle street disputes .

"(CNN) -- If the one great book of American popular music is ever written, Doc Watson might not even need his own chapter. He has a solo -- or a harmony part, or a lead vocal, or a single perfect guitar lick -- in all the important chapters of the past 50 years. Watson, who died on Tuesday at age 89, is most closely associated with the melodic style of flatpicking that cemented the guitar's role as a solo voice in bluegrass and acoustic country music. But unlike the three-finger ""Scruggs style"" named after banjo pioneer Earl Scruggs, who crossed musical paths with Watson a number of times across the decades, there isn't a single ""Watson style."" The flatpicking turned heads, but the tune that followed it might be a fingerstyle blues, a Travis-flavored country bounce or a parlor song from the Carter repertoire. Watson was a master tailor, not a designer; he fitted techniques to the needs of the song or the generations of players who sat next to him, as if they had been designed that way from the start. Watson, blind from childhood, took an understated pride in being able to support his family independently. He was already a seasoned local and regional performer, playing both old-time music and what he called ""rockabilly and pop standards,"" when the folk boom of the 1960s put him in front of a new set of audiences with his voice, banjo and acoustic guitar. For some performers, the welcome influx of new audiences also brought calls for a change in repertoire. Watson merely changed gears; he was comfortable with the ballads and tunes he'd grown up with, and he was equally deft at re-creating the brother duets he had heard on the radio when he played them with their author, Bill Monroe, the prickly creator of bluegrass music. By the late 1960s, Watson was well known to urban folk audiences and increasingly in the country stronghold of Nashville as well; he had even joined Scruggs and Lester Flatt, the former Monroe sidemen who had become the best-known names in bluegrass, for an instrumental album. His neutrality in personal and stylistic feuds reflected his own musical open-mindedness and served him well when the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was recruiting traditional performers for a three-album tribute to its own country roots, ""Will the Circle be Unbroken."" The ""Circle"" helped define the sound of dorm rooms and hallways and the song lists of bar bands. Audiences that had never listened to the Grand Ole Opry itself would applaud the ""Grand Ole Opry Song,"" and they expected the Watson touches that knitted the album together: the instrumental styles, the vocals, the playful treatment of tunes like ""Tennessee Stud."" That milestone album could have capped a career. For Watson, it wasn't even a halfway point; he had nearly four decades still to go. (Indeed, he was scheduled to perform next in June with a number of longtime collaborators at a celebration of his work at the North Carolina Museum of Art.) The newly world-famous Watson was strikingly consistent with the original. He continued to tour primarily with his son, Merle. He recorded music he liked with performers he liked, and he kept an ear out for the generation that was coming up behind him. The Doc Watson you saw on the national stage or heard on public radio was the same one you saw at small festivals in out-of-the-way parts of North Carolina: intimate, genial, as distinctive playing rhythm as he was in the spotlight. There was never a public watershed where Watson formally broke with his roots or humbly returned to them. His roots were always part of what he did; he just kept adding new roots. That's not to say there were no changes; Merle's death in a farming accident in 1985 was an unimaginable loss, personally and professionally. Watson adapted, with the help of players who could tour and play in the way Merle had. The genre-blending MerleFest, held each year since 1988 as a fundraiser for Wilkes Community College, is a lasting tribute. Watson continued to record: with country giants like Chet Atkins, newgrass superstars like David Grisman and Tony Rice, and by the end of the century with Merle's son Richard. He was onstage with Scruggs again in 2003 -- as ""The Three Pickers,"" with Ricky Skaggs and such next-generation guests as Alison Krauss -- in a concert that Variety called ""one highlight after another."" The British folk rebels of the early 1970s explained their rocked-out Child ballads as a way of taking folk music out of museums and giving it back to folks. Doc Watson made his share of music for museums and dignitaries and international audiences, but it was the same music he would have made in your living room: extraordinary music for ordinary occasions.","Doc Watson switched gears to adapt to changing musical scene .

"London (CNN) -- With its early colonial portraits, depictions of grand historical battles, transcendentalist landscapes and intimate, turn-of-the-century paintings of the elite classes, the collection of American art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York ranks as one of the finest in the world. It also functions as a visual timeline for the events in the nation's history. ""It's American history through the eyes of American artists,"" said Morrison Heckscher, Chairman of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ""Most of the major trends, the events of importance in the nation's history, were addressed by artists in one way or another -- war, Civil War, the environment, all of these things,"" he said. Now, the American Wing at the museum has been re-configured for the 21st century and has re-opened to the public following a decade-long renovation program. ""The display of the art is broadly chronological,"" said Heckscher, explaining that the re-designed galleries move from early colonial paintings, onto the post-Revolutionary period, the Hudson River School, the Civil War era and finally to the late-nineteenth century paintings of John Singer Sargent and James McNeill Whistler. Hermitage sets up 'mini-museum' in Madrid's Prado . Also on display are collections of American decorative arts, including furniture, silverware and ceramics. ""We want to treat these different media as works of art on their own -- it's an effort to have a broader a view of what constitutes art,"" said Heckscher. But the jewel in the collection, according to Heckscher, is Emanuel Leutze's monumental painting Washington Crossing the Delaware, which depicts George Washington crossing an iceberg-strewn river with his troops at a pivotal moment in the revolution. ""It was a major history painting, Leutze had done a series of history paintings that documented and touched on the evolution of the United States as a democratic society,"" said curator at the American Wing Elizabeth Mankin Kornhauser. Leutze grew up in America but subsequently moved back to his native Germany, where he painted Washington Crossing the Delaware in 1851. ""The intention was really to fuel the quest for freedom in Europe and Germany by looking back in time to this great hero of the American Revolution, creating this kind of mythic historical scene, an event that was a turning point in the revolution,"" said Kornhauser. It was later taken to America and served as a focal point during the Civil War, Kornhauser said, and has fallen in and out of public favor ever since. Now it takes pride of place in the new galleries. Also on display following a recent acquisition -- obtained just three days before the new wing opened in January -- is a sculpture of Abraham Lincoln by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, a reduction of the one that stands in Lincoln Park in Chicago. ""This is particularly exciting for us because it was originally in the collection of John Hay and John Hay was Lincoln's private secretary during the Civil War,"" said curator Thayer Tolles. Khubiliai Khan's riches travel to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art . The sculpture portrays Lincoln deep in thought and looking, according to Thayer, ""as if the weight of the world is on his shoulders."" Though the works in the collection are arranged chronologically, themes emerge throughout -- notably the importance of the environment. Kornhauser describes a painting by Thomas Cole, founder of the landscape-oriented, mid-19th-century Hudson River School, depicting a tourist attraction on the Connecticut River. ""He's portrayed settled land on the right and wilderness on the left and it's essentially his manifesto to preserve the wilderness, to not lose sight of the beauty and spiritual importance of the wilderness as we rush to settle the land,"" said Kornhauser. ""It's almost like the beginning of the environmental movement, portrayed in this painting,"" she continued. This also comes through in the 1918 bronze sculpture ""End of the Trail,"" by James Earle Fraser, which portrays a Native American sat slumped on his exhausted horse and which functions as a metaphor, according to Thayer, ""for the effect of Euro-American settlement on the American West."" What also emerges throughout the collection is the enduring influence of European styles in American art. Through the works, said Tholles, you can see ""an interesting blend of European sophistication and aesthetics with American subjects."" This carries through from the early colonial portraits by British artists, which influenced American painters such as John Singleton Copley, all the way through to Europhile John Singer Sargent. ""What is American art?"" said Heckscher. ""Well, it's somewhat in the eye of the beholder.""","Newly reopened American Wing at Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York shows American history through art .

"(CNN) -- Two murder suspects who escaped from an Arkansas jail have been captured in a vacant house just a couple of miles away, Miller County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Duke Schoefield said Friday. Quincy Vernard Stewart, 36, and Cortez Rashod Hooper, 23, escaped from jail Monday and were captured by law officers Thursday night in Texarkana, Arkansas, Schoefield said. When officers entered the house, both men ran. Hooper was tackled by two officers and Stewart dove out a window right into the arms of two other officers, Schoefield said. ""They were mouthy once handcuffed, and on camera one of them said, 'It was easy getting out. I'll do it again,'"" Schoefield told CNN. ""When we arrested them, they were in possession of a loaded firearm."" Earlier this week, authorities arrested Stewart's mother on accusations of helping the two murder suspects escape jail by sneaking in hacksaw blades. Charlene Stewart, 55, of Texarkana, passed up to four hacksaw blades to her son, authorities said. Schoefield said Charlene Stewart was arrested late Tuesday and was in a Texarkana jail facing felony charges of furnishing prohibited articles and implements of escape. Schoefield said an investigation revealed how the hacksaws were brought into the jail. Stewart had a court date on May 20 in the courthouse in downtown Texarkana, and Stewart's mother was in the gallery, Schoefield said. ""When about 22 prisoners were taken out of the courtroom with Stewart being one of them, his mother was able to pass to him a bag containing hacksaw blades, small amount of marijuana and a cell phone,"" Schoefield said. ""He placed the articles in his legal papers,"" contained in a large legal-size envelope, Schoefield said. ""By federal law authorities are not allowed to search a prisoner's legal papers, so when he was searched at the jail upon return, he was able to sneak the hacksaws in."" Authorities' search of the jail cell showed that the two suspects apparently used a hacksaw to cut through metal bars covering a 1-by-3.5-foot window and then broke the glass to gain access to an outside courtyard, authorities said. Two mattresses were pushed through the broken window in an effort to soften the detainees' landing. The two suspects then managed to get outside a 10-foot fence topped with razor wire. A police K-9 unit was brought in but failed to track the men. Hooper is charged with first-degree murder and aggravated assault, said county dispatcher Vanessa Schaeffer. Stewart was being held on a capital murder charge from Bowie County, Texas, and also is charged with possession of a controlled substance.","Quincy Vernard Stewart and Cortez Rashod Hooper are caught in a vacant house .

"(CNN) -- Bloody clashes erupted Saturday between pro- and anti-Syrian regime fighters in the Lebanese city of Tripoli, the deadliest outburst of violence in recent weeks and further indication that Syria's turmoil is spilling across borders. Twelve people were killed and approximately 50 were wounded in the latest fighting, according to the state-run National News Agency. Of those hurt, 12 were transported to a hospital in the coastal city, including one in critical condition. At one point, a continuous stream of ""rocket bombs"" hindered national security forces' attempts to secure the area, the news agency said. One rocket exploded over a well-known castle in the city, while another landed some distance away. Prime Minister Najib Mikati went to Tripoli to assess the security situation, state news reported. After meeting with leaders from the different factions involved in the clashes, Interior Minister Marwan Charbel announced that national security forces will enter the area to enforce a cease-fire set to begin at 5 a.m. Sunday. Anyone who does not abide by the cease-fire ""will bear responsibility,"" said Charbel, according to the official news agency. The sectarian violence in Tripoli -- which is on the Mediterranean coast, about 50 miles from Homs in Syria -- mirrors the tensions in its neighboring nation. Clashes in both nations pit Sunnis, who make up the majority of the Syrian opposition and population, against Alawites and other Shiites, who are dominant in President Bashar al-Assad's government. Sunnis are the majority in northern Lebanon, where Tripoli is located and where anti-Assad factions are relatively strong. The Syrian president, meanwhile, has more support in southern Lebanon and among members of the powerful Shiite militant and political group Hezbollah, which is considered a terrorist organization by U.S. authorities. Saturday's fighting is not the first time tensions have simmered over, including in Tripoli. Last month, violence flared after Lebanese authorities arrested Chadi Mawlawi, an Islamist activist who was helping Syrian refugees by providing food and shelter, his cousin said. Lebanon had accused Mawlawi of being an operative in an al Qaeda-inspired group -- something his relatives deny. The activist was eventually released, but not before his arrest sparked fighting that killed seven people and left dozens wounded. Elsewhere in Lebanon, the kidnapping of a group of Shiite Muslim pilgrims in Syria prompted angry protests last month in Beirut, the capital. Also last month, gun battles in Beirut between rival political parties -- one supporting Syria's al-Assad and one opposing him -- left two dead and 18 wounded. That was the worst outbreak of violence in a city where the powerful Hezbollah militia engaged government troops in street battles in 2008. That bloodshed came hours after Lebanese troops killed two Sunni Muslim clerics -- both opposed to the embattled Syrian regime -- at a checkpoint in northern Lebanon. Syria has long been a major influence in Lebanon, and not just because of the extensive border the two nations share. Lebanon was considered part of ""greater Syria"" until the end of World War I. Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005, primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peacekeepers to help stop Lebanon's long civil war, though they stayed long after the fighting stopped in 1990. The Syrian forces' 2005 withdrawal followed the car-bomb killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut, which some blamed on elements of al-Assad's regime. Since then, Lebanon's most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided -- the ruling pro-Syria alliance led by Prime Minister Najib Mikati on one side and anti-Syrian factions led by Saad Hariri, the son of the assassinated former prime minister, on the other. The unrest in Syria that began 15 months ago with peaceful anti-government protests, followed by a government crackdown, has meant further complications for Lebanon. Thousands of refugees have poured across the border. And in April the Lebanese army announced it had intercepted a cargo ship bound for Tripoli that was filled with weapons it believes were meant to be delivered to rebel forces in Syria. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and Nick Thompson contributed to this report.","12 dead, 50 are wounded in fighting in the coastal city of Tripoli, state news reports .

"(CNN) -- A Texas judge sentenced a Mexican drug gang leader to life in prison Thursday after he pleaded guilty to murder and weapons charges related to the killing of a U.S. consulate employee and her husband, officials said. Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez, 34, also pleaded guilty to racketeering, drug trafficking and money laundering charges at his trial in El Paso, Texas, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement. The authorities said Acosta, who is also known as ""El Diego,"" admitted that he had directed or participated in more than 1,500 murders since 2008, when he became the leader of La Linea -- the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel -- and a local boss for the cartel in the Mexican cities of Juarez and Chihuahua. Among the killings that occurred under his watch was the shooting on March 13, 2010, of U.S. consulate employee Lesley Enriquez , who was gunned down with her husband, Arthur Redelfs, in Ciudad Juarez as they left a birthday party in their white SUV. Jorge Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of another consulate employee, was killed in a separate vehicle. ""We are determined to hold accountable those individuals who committed the consulate murders, and to dismantle the dangerous criminal enterprise that fueled these and many other tragic and senseless acts of violence,"" Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer said in the Justice Department statement Thursday, accusing Acosta of directing a ""reign of terror."" The Mexican authorities had listed him among their most wanted criminals and offered a 15 million peso reward for information leading to his arrest. They announced his capture last July. He was extradited to the United States from Mexico last month, the Justice Department said. Officials said Thursday that law enforcement agents in Mexico and the United States played a key role in the investigation. ""Gangs and other criminal organizations that threaten public safety on both sides of the border are on notice that we are working more closely than ever with our Mexican counterparts to shut them down,"" Breuer said. The Mexican authorities have arrested several other people who they accuse of being connected to the consulate killings. Acosta pleaded guilty Thursday to four counts of racketeering, narcotics trafficking and money laundering. He also pleaded guilty to seven counts of murder and weapons charges ""specifically related"" to the consulate killings, the Justice Department said. Olga Bashbush, spokeswoman for the U.S. consulate in Ciudad Juarez, declined to comment on Acosta's guilty plea. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","The authorities say Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez is connected to 1,500 killings .

"(CNN) -- Last week, Apple released its sixth annual supplier responsibility report, which detailed violations made by its suppliers. In the same week, news surfaced that about 150 Chinese workers at a giant manufacturing plant that produces Microsoft's Xbox 360 had threatened mass suicide by throwing themselves off their factory rooftop amid a labor dispute. The incident involving one of Apple's chief competitors took place at a Foxconn factory complex in Wuhan, roughly 600 miles from the better-known port city of Shenzhen. American media outlets carried a haunting photo showing dozens of workers assembled on a rooftop, with several standing at its edge. We pluck our favorite phone or game controller off racks at our local electronics store, or they arrive at our doorstep, but in fact, they originate in Chinese cities like Shenzhen and Wuhan. As a result, labor disputes and injustices on the other side of the world feel far away and difficult to judge. Journalistic exposÃ©s, along with Mike Daisey's highly scrutinized one-man play ""The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs,"" have sought to raise awareness of conditions at Foxconn factories in China in recent months. They describe long hours, low wages and overcrowded worker housing units, even if Businessweek reported last May that Foxconn had started making strides under pressure from Apple. Still, as we hear stories like the one out of Wuhan last week -- albeit not of Apple, but one of its competitors -- there seems to be a collective sense of confusion, helplessness and resignation on the part of consumers. The fact that we are overwhelmed is understandable. Foxconn is the unimaginably huge, yet virtually unknown producer of the most popular, best-selling gadgets of our time, with an estimated 800,000 employees. It manufactures products like Amazon's Kindle, Nintendo's Wii, Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation, among many other consumer electronics. But chief among them are Apple's iPhone and iPad, which dwarf most others in sales and stature. As the unrivaled global technology leader, Apple needs to step up its pressure on Foxconn and raise its supply chain standards to remedy labor injustices. We consumers need to stand with them; we've done it before. Just look at the sweatshop movement in the 1990s. The National Labor Committee created a media frenzy over the child labor that was used to create Kathie Lee Gifford's Walmart label, effectively ending it. On a larger scale, the United Students Against Sweatshops all but eradicated products that were created by exploitative labor for sale on campuses, simply by raising awareness among students and demanding more from manufacturing standards. In recent days, students at Duke University, Apple CEO Tim Cook's alma mater, published an open letter calling on Cook and Apple to guarantee ""conflict-free"" products. In releasing Apple's supplier responsibility report, Cook is acknowledging Apple's role, and in an internal memo to Apple staff, he said, ""No one in our industry is driving improvements for workers the way Apple is today."" We, as consumers, have to embrace our own responsibility to the workers who labor over our coveted gadgets by keeping pressure on Apple and its competitors to ensure that they will change their ways. With injuries and suicides at Foxconn's manufacturing facilities already documented, lives are literally on the line. We can start by demanding that Apple and other companies that use suppliers like Foxconn provide a safe and healthy work environment for their employees. If Foxconn can deliver on Apple's extraordinary product and packaging demands, it certainly has the ability to make this happen. Scores of Chinese workers have stood up under desperate, if not oppressive, circumstances by one of Apple's foremost competitors, probably just trying to keep up. While Daisey and others remain intent on associating Apple's late founder with the company's poor labor practices, this can and should be Cook's defining moment. After all, before being anointed CEO, Cook was the supply chain guru behind Apple's remarkable rebirth and success. But this isn't just on Cook or Apple; it's on all of us.

"(CNN) -- Snigdha Nandipati, 14, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday night by spelling ""guetapens,"" which means an ambush, snare or trap. ""I was just taking it one word at a time,"" the eighth-grader from San Diego told CNN on Friday morning. ""I just wanted to get each word right. I didn't really think about winning, really."" She said that properly spelling the winning word, which is derived from French, was not difficult. She had seen the word before and knew it, she said. Nandipati didn't truly register her victory until the confetti started falling, she said. ""I didn't expect to win. There were some very good competitors this year,"" she said. In last year's spelling bee, she tied for 27th place. The agony and ecstasy of the National Spelling Bee . Nandipati's victory in the 13th round came moments after her final challenger, Stuti Mishra of Orlando, also 14, stumbled over the spelling of ""schwarmerei,"" which means excessive, unbridled enthusiasm or attachment. Arvind Mahankali, a 12-year-old seventh-grader from New York City, came in third when he misspelled ""schwannoma,"" a tumor of the sheath of a peripheral nerve. According to a tweet from @ScrippsBee, Nandipati studied six hours per day. She was cheered on by her brother, her parents (her father coached her) and her grandparents, who had traveled from India to watch. The contest was held in the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, outside Washington. Nandipati wins $30,000 and an engraved trophy from Scripps, a $2,500 U.S. savings bond and reference library from Merriam-Webster, a $5,000 scholarship from the Sigma Phil Epsilon Educational Foundation and more than $2,600 in reference works from Encyclopaedia Britannica. This year's spelling bee saw the youngest contestant, 6-year-old Lori Anne Madison of Lake Ridge, Virginia. She spelled ""dirigible"" with aplomb, but was eliminated Wednesday night when she misspelled ""ingluvies,"" which is a pouch used by birds as a receptacle for food. Nicholas Rushlow, a 14-year-old eighth-grader from Lancaster, Ohio, was eliminated when he misspelled ""vetiver,"" an aeromatic grass whose especially fragrant root yields an oil used in perfumery and mats in India. Asked what was going through his mind when he heard the word, he said, ""Oh, crap."" It was his fifth and final performance in the contest. Asked what he was going to do with all the time he had previously devoted to spelling, he said, ""I'm going to have to find a new hobby.""","""I was just taking it one word at a time,"" Snigdha Nandipati says .

"(CNN) -- The parents of a New York Rangers player found dead in his apartment have decided to donate his brain to Boston University researchers studying the effects of concussion in athletes, a medical examiner's office said Sunday. New York Rangers enforcer Derek Boogaard was found dead Friday in his Minneapolis apartment. An autopsy was conducted Saturday, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office in Minnesota, which confirmed that Boogaard's parents signed papers to donate Boogaard's brain. The office has not released a cause of death, saying it was waiting for toxicology test results that might not be determined for several weeks. Dr. Robert Stern, co-director for Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, confirmed Sunday that the family has donated Boogard's brain to the VA CSTE Brain Bank for study. The center has a donation registry for athletes to study effects of trauma on the brain and spinal cord. Boogaard, 28, began his NHL career with the Minnesota Wild. The Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, native joined the Rangers last July and appeared in 22 games during the 2010-11 season. ""Derek was an extremely kind and caring individual,"" New York Rangers President Glen Sather said on the team's website. ""He was a very thoughtful person, who will be dearly missed by all those who knew him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, friends and teammates during this difficult time."" Boogaard supported the Defending the Blue Line Foundation, a nonprofit that ensures the children of military personnel get the opportunity to play hockey. While with the Rangers, he created ""Boogaard's Booguardians,"" which hosted military families at home games, according to the website.

"(CNN) -- An isolated Indian tribe in Brazil seemingly has vanished like a morning mist in the Amazon jungle. Concerns are rising that the tribe, filmed this past year for the first time, may have been run off by drug traffickers. Aid group Survival International first reported this week that suspected traffickers had destroyed a Brazilian guard post built near the tribe's location to protect them from outsiders. The organization said it was feared that a nearby river has become a transit point for cocaine from Peru. An overflight of huts where the tribe lives showed no one in the area, Bruno Perez, a spokesman for Brazil's National Indian Foundation (FUNAI), told CNN Thursday. The fact that none of the Indians could be spotted by the air is worrisome, Perez said. However, the huts were still standing and the crops appeared untouched, which indicates that contact was not made, at least not there. Video of the previously uncontacted tribe, released in February, made headlines around the world, as did 2008 photos of a settlement. In the videos, residents in bright body paint stand near thatch-covered structures. It's not clear if the images were of the same Amazon tribe. ""We have done overflights before, and they were not scared, and we were even able to take photos of them,"" Perez said. It is possible that the Indians fled or were hiding in fear, he said, but added, ""We don't know if there was contact."" Authorities recovered a backpack, believed to belong to a drug trafficker, that had an arrow inside of it. A clue, but ""that doesn't mean there was contact,"" Perez said. More than 100 uncontacted tribes remain worldwide, and about half live in the remote reaches of the Amazonian rainforest in Peru or Brazil, says Survival International, which advocates for tribal peoples. It refers to such tribes as ""peoples who have no peaceful contact with anyone in the mainstream or dominant society."" Brazil and Survival International have warned of the dangers posed by logging and disease. Loggers in Peru are pushing isolated Indians from Peru into Brazil, where, according to Survival International, ""the two groups are likely to come into conflict."" Brazilian authorities said they know that the armed men seen in the area -- about 40 of them -- crossed the border from Peru, but they don't know the nationality of the suspected traffickers or with what criminal organization they might work. The incursion was first reported by Indians from the Ashaninka people, who at the end of July reported to Funai that a group of armed men from Peru ransacked their village. This village was about five days by boat away from the area where a number of isolated and uncontacted tribes reside, Funai said. As a result, Brazilian authorities dispatched a group of federal police to the region. Maj. Luis Baca of the National Police of Peru told CNN that they have an outpost on the Peruvian side not far from where the armed men were spotted, but said that he had not received any recent reports of traffickers in that area. Perez, of Funai, agreed that drug trafficking in the area was new. ""In this region, drug trafficking is an isolated problem,"" he said. It was the first time that traffickers were suspected of crossing from Peru in the area near the Indian tribe.","Some suspect that drug traffickers from Peru ran off an uncontacted tribe .
The area where the Indians live appears untouched, but no one is there .
Federal police made one arrest and are looking for armed men ."
"(CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi will not be part of the African Union's next attempt to map out a peace deal in the war-torn nation, the organization said in a statement Sunday. ""The AU high-level ad hoc committee welcomes Colonel Gadhafi's acceptance of not being part of the negotiation process,"" the statement said. It was unclear who would represent the Libyan government in negotiations, or when negotiations would occur. Journalists were not allowed to ask questions at a news conference after Sunday's meeting of the African Union's special committee on Libya in Pretoria, South Africa. Members of the committee have met with Gadhafi and opposition leaders over the past three months. Another African Union-led attempt to broker peace between Gadhafi and the rebels fell through in April. South African President Jacob Zuma told the committee Sunday that continued bombing by NATO and its allies was a ""concern,"" since protecting the Libyan people was the intention behind a U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force in the North African nation. ""The intention was not to authorize a campaign for regime change or political assassination,"" he said. The committee repeated calls Sunday for a cease-fire between the Libyan government and rebels. ""Only a political solution will make it possible to sustainably settle the current conflict,"" the statement said. It also urged the temporary ""stopping of NATO bombings"" to allow delivery of humanitarian aid. ""Civilian lives have been lost due to these bombings, and civilian infrastructure has suffered untold damage,"" Zuma said. Ahead of Sunday's meeting, human rights activists urged the African Union to prioritize the issue of the plight of civilians caught in armed conflicts, including Libya. The meeting followed claims a day earlier by the Libyan government that NATO warplanes bombed a bakery and a restaurant in a key oil refinery town east of Tripoli, a charge the alliance has countered. Gadhafi has been a strong supporter of the African Union and has channeled large sums of money its way. Libya also holds a seat on the 15-member Peace and Security Council, which is headed by Lamamra. The African Union's committee on Libya includes representatives from Mauritania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Uganda and South Africa. Opposition leaders had voiced doubt that any mediation involving that multinational group would end the conflict in a way that would satisfy their goals, which include Gadhafi's ouster. In its proposed agreement in April, the African Union said Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop all hostilities and allow outside forces to help keep the peace. But rebels rejected the non-binding proposal, saying it did not address whether Gadhafi would step down or provide any solution to the violence against the Libyan people. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have blamed the Gadhafi regime for violations of human rights, including indiscriminate fire on civilians, the use of internationally banned cluster bombs and the torture and executions of captured fighters. On Sunday, an International Committee of the Red Cross ship arrived in Tripoli from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi with about 100 people on board. It was the second time in a week that the ICRC has reunited friends and families between the the eastern opposition-controlled city and the western regime-controlled city. NATO began bombing military targets in March after the U.N. Security Council issued a resolution authorizing force by whatever means necessary, with the exception of a ground invasion, to protect civilians. Libya accused NATO on Saturday of killing civilians in airstrikes, with NATO responding that it struck key command-and-control centers. The alliance said there was ""no indication of civilian casualties in connection with these strikes."" Gadhafi's forces have occupied buildings in an abandoned area of al-Brega from where they are launching attacks on civilians, a NATO statement said. The alliance monitored the buildings and said it determined they were clear military targets. ""This continues to show Gadhafi's reprehensible tactics of placing military assets and operations at the heart of civilian neighborhoods,"" said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, NATO commander for the Libya campaign. ""We have meticulously monitored these developments for a significant period and it was time to remove this threat,"" he said. Al-Brega is a key oil refinery town about 500 miles east of Tripoli that has been the scene of heavy fighting between pro-Gadhafi forces and rebel fighters. Abdul Hafiz Ghoga, a spokesman and deputy chairman of the opposition's Transitional National Council, said Gadhafi bears a lot of the responsibility for civilian casualties as the Libyan leader keeps weapons near where people live. Also Saturday, Libyan state TV said NATO strikes hit Gharyan, a city in the west. The report cited an unnamed military source who said a number of people were killed and wounded in the attack. CNN cannot independently confirm the claim. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse, Raja Razek, Yousuf Basil and Ingrid Formanek and journalist David Adams contributed to this report.","NEW: South Africa's president says civilian lives have been lost in NATO bombings .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he was overwhelmed and afraid during last year's nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, acknowledging that little has been done since then to ensure that another nuclear disaster will not occur. Sounding like a fiery anti-nuclear activist, Kan Monday testified before a panel appointed by parliament to investigate the nuclear disaster. ""There wasn't much information coming to me"" from the government regulatory agency, NISA, or the plant's operator, TEPCO, Kan said. ""I thought I couldn't make any countermeasures in this crisis. I felt fear."" During his testimony, Kan turned a critical finger on himself, Japan's bureaucrats and TEPCO, saying all were hoping the situation would not spiral more out of control. He said all often were more worried about protecting their jobs and turf than public safety. Kan specifically pointed to a request from TEPCO to evacuate the Fukushima plant -- a request he refused. ""The worst case scenario was that 30 million people would have to evacuate from the capital (Tokyo),"" Kan told the panel. ""That would come to within one inch of the end of this nation."" Kan said he did his best to share information with the public, but admitted there weren't many verified facts to share. Over the weekend, Yukio Edano, Kan's former chief cabinet secretary, testified that his office rejected a U.S. offer to supply nuclear experts, saying it was ""not appropriate."" Kan told the panel that he heard about the U.S. offer after the fact, but supported Edano's decision. Kan also spoke about Japan's so-called ""nuclear village."" That's the term used to describe the utilities, nuclear regulators, bureaucrats and academics who support the usage of nuclear energy in Japan. It's a group Kan said shows no remorse for the disaster. The first priority of Japan's new nuclear policy should be to dismantle the power of the nuclear village, along with all nuclear power plants, Kan said. ""I would like to say to the Japanese and to the world -- the safest nuclear policy is not to have any nuclear plants.""","Kan says his government refused the help of U.S. nuclear experts .

"(CNN) -- A woman who was convicted at a trial for wearing pants -- clothing deemed indecent by Sudanese authorities -- was released from jail Tuesday after being imprisoned for a day, a United Nations spokesman said. Sudanese journalist Lubna Ahmed al-Hussein was facing 40 lashes for wearing trousers. Lubna al-Hussein, a journalist who worked in the media department of the United Nations mission in Sudan, was jailed Monday for refusing to pay a court-ordered fine, her lawyer, Nabil Adib, said. No further details of her release were immediately available. Al-Hussein had faced 40 lashes for wearing pants deemed too tight and a blouse considered too sheer. However, the court she appeared before on Monday spared her the lashes, and instead ordered her to pay a fine of 500 Sudanese pounds ($209) or face a month in prison, her attorney said. Adib told CNN after the trial that al-Hussein refused to pay the fine as a ""matter of principle."" She will appeal her verdict in an effort to have the conservative Muslim government's decency law declared unconstitutional, her attorney said by phone Monday from Khartoum, Sudan. Al-Hussein, who was arrested in July, pleaded not guilty during her one-day trial, Adib said. She was not allowed to call defense witnesses or present a defense case, he added. ""She thinks that she did not have fair trial and a conviction was wrong so she did not want to pay the fine nor let anyone else pay on her behalf,"" Adib said. Al-Hussein resigned from her U.N. position to waive her immunity as an international worker and face trial. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he is concerned about al-Hussein's case. ""The United Nations will make every effort to ensure that the rights of its staff members are protected,"" Ban said in July. ""The flogging is against the international human rights standards."" In August, scores of protesters supporting al-Hussein gathered outside the courtroom in Khartoum, waving banners and wearing headbands with the messages, ""No return to the dark ages"" and ""No to suppressing women."" On Monday, Sudanese security forces fought back scores of al-Hussein supporters, injuring some and detaining 47 women, according to an eyewitness who spoke to CNN by phone. A Sudanese official accused ""the West"" of interfering in the case. Al-Hussein was arrested along with 18 other women on July 3 at a Khartoum restaurant when police burst in and checked women for their clothing. At the time of her arrest she was wearing pants, a blouse and a hijab -- a headscarf worn by Muslim women, she said.","Journalist Lubna al-Hussein faced 40 lashes for wearing pants deemed too tight .

"(CNN) -- The mixed reaction to the conviction of a New Jersey college student of a hate crime, after he spied on his gay roommate while he was having sex, has revealed an interesting generational split in the gay community. Many people my age, who grew up in the '50s and the '60s, when nearly everyone felt they had to be in the closet, seem to be sympathetic to the idea that a conviction that will discourage the kind of behavior Dharun Ravi engaged in is a good thing. The fact that his roommate committed suicide the day after the spying occurred, by throwing himself off the George Washington Bridge, certainly contributed to the climate that made many people satisfied by Ravi's conviction. But quite a few younger gays -- 20-somethings -- seem more interested in a nuanced interpretation of Ravi's behavior, and much more concerned that he faces the possibility of a 10-year prison sentence. It's partly their closeness to the age of the defendant that makes them empathetic to the perpetrator of an offensive prank, which may have sparked a catastrophic outcome. But this is also a generation of gay people who grew up recognizing three distinct groups among their straight peers: supporters, neutrals and committed homophobes. And despite the jury's verdict, they remain unconvinced that Ravi belongs in that third category. They are also more skeptical about the connection between Ravi's spying and the subsequent suicide of Tyler Clementi. ""We don't really know why Clementi jumped from that bridge,"" is a typical assessment. After his conviction, Ravi told the New Jersey Star-Ledger, ""I won't ever get up there and tell the world I hated Tyler because he was gay, or tell the world I was trying to hurt or intimidate him, because it's not true."" Many younger gay men believe him: They say the seemingly anti-gay messages Ravi sent to his friends fall far short of proving the kind of hatred they think is worthy of a hate crime conviction. ""I've seen so much worse,"" Tyler Picone told Ian Parker for a piece about the case in The New Yorker. ""The stuff that Dharun says is understandable, in a sense. If you find you're sharing a room with somebody gay, and you haven't been raised in an open home, you're going to say, 'Oh my God, what am I going to do?' "" Writing in Slate, 24-year-old gay editor and columnist J. Bryan Lowder said that while he certainly was not ""excusing Ravi for his actions,"" he believes that ""these civil rights statutes are being stretched to go after teenagers who acted meanly, but not violently. This isn't what civil rights laws should be for. ... We live in a world that validates adult bullies all the time."" It was also Lowder who said the precise reason for the boy's suicide is ultimately unknowable. ""Based on the evidence that we do have, the image of Ravi as a malicious homophobe getting his just deserts looks dubious at best."" The complex point of view of this younger generation demonstrates how far we have come from the black and white world of the 1950s, when anti-gay prejudice was so commonplace that even the American Civil Liberties Union refused to oppose an executive order in 1953 when the federal government banned gay employees in all of its agencies and all of their contractors. A new generation of gay people believe that Ravi is far from being an outright bigot. They see his acts as immature and unfortunate, but they reject the view of the New Jersey jurors who decided he should be punished for hate. Ravi refused a plea bargain that could have spared him a prison term, but would have required him to plead guilty to a crime that he believes he did not commit. The usual practice in criminal courts across America is to punish someone with a harsh prison sentence when he is convicted by a jury after he has declined such a bargain. But my younger friends have convinced me that Ravi deserves a more nuanced punishment. Since Ravi insists he is without prejudice, he should be sentenced to speak at a different high school every week for a year. The nightmare he has already experienced makes him the perfect person to share a vital lesson: You don't have to hate gay people in your heart to cause misery to others. Just the perception that you are anti-gay can sometimes have disastrous consequences. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Kaiser.","New Jersey college student faces 10-year prison sentence on hate crime conviction .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The wives of the British and German ambassadors to the United Nations have taken on Syria's first lady in an online video, calling on Asma al-Assad to ""stop your husband"" and ""stop being a bystander."" The roughly four-minute video, posted to YouTube, juxtaposes pictures of an elegant al-Assad, the wife of Bashar al-Assad, against images of other Syrian women, and dead and wounded children. ""We want her (al-Assad) to speak out for the end of violence. That is what we want. Stop the bloodshed. Stop it now. We know this is a risk for you, but take this risk,"" Huberta von Voss-Wittig, the wife of Germany's U.N. ambassador, told CNN. Speaking to CNN in interviews Tuesday and Wednesday, Voss-Wittig said the Syrian first lady ""should get her act together"" and ""not worry so much about her husband but worry a little bit more about women in her country."" A U.N. diplomat said the video was produced by Voss-Wittig and Sheila Lyall Grant, the wife of Britain's U.N. ambassador, ""on their own initiative."" Voss-Wittig stresses that the video isn't a U.N. product or ""done by us as spouses."" ""It's done by us as women who care and as women who have an international profile ourselves,"" she said. Profile: Asma al-Assad, Syria's first lady . Syria has been engulfed in violence for 13 months as a national uprising spread after the government began cracking down on peaceful protests. The United Nations estimates at least 9,000 people have died since the demonstrations began, while others put the death toll at more than 11,000. The video comes days after U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan forged what has become a fragile cease-fire. ""We think it's a good moment now that the cease-fire has been installed. It's very wobbly, it's not quite working yet but we think she should not hide behind her husband's back anymore and should come forward with a straight message for peace,"" Voss-Wittig said. ""Stand up for peace, Asma,"" a voice in the video demands. ""Speak out now. For the sake of your people. Stop your husband and his supporters. Stop being a bystander."" In one clip, the Syrian first lady can be seen bending down to kiss a young girl stepping off a bus. The next image is of a woman embracing what appears to be a dead child. ""Asma, when you kiss your own children goodnight, another mother will find the place next to her empty,"" the narrator says. The video is the latest in a series of professionally produced videos aimed at stirring or shocking people into action. It asks viewers to sign a petition. Other recent examples that went viral include ""Kony 2012,"" a documentary on a notorious Africa warlord's use of child soldiers in Uganda, and a video showing Mexican children acting out the roles of drug traffickers, kidnappers and victims. Once described by Vogue magazine as ""a rose in the desert,"" the London-born al-Assad graduated from King's College with a degree in computer science. She worked for JP Morgan as an investment banker before marrying Bashar al-Assad in 2000, just months after he became president. According to a cache of e-mails leaked to CNN, the first lady appears to have spent much of the past year shopping online for expensive jewelry, art and furniture, and e-mailing boutiques in London and Paris. In one e-mail exchange with an art dealer in London, she -- apparently using a false name -- inquired about six artworks that feature butterflies. The dealer responds that the works cost between Â£5,000 and Â£10,500 ($7,800 and $16,500). The art inquiry was sent October 28, the same day Syrian protesters staged a massive demonstration in the city of Hama in which they called for an end to the Syrian president's rule.

"(CNN) -- A candidate for the Republican National Committee chairmanship said Friday the CD he sent committee members for Christmas -- which included a song titled ""Barack the Magic Negro"" -- was clearly intended as a joke. The title of the song about President-elect Barack Obama was drawn from a Los Angeles Times column. ""I think most people recognize political satire when they see it,"" Tennessee Republican Chip Saltsman told CNN. ""I think RNC members understand that."" The song, set to the tune of ""Puff the Magic Dragon,"" was first played on conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh's radio show in 2007. Its title was drawn from a Los Angeles Times column that suggested President-elect Barack Obama appealed to those who feel guilty about the nation's history of mistreatment of African-Americans. Saltsman said the song, penned by his longtime friend Paul Shanklin, should be easily recognized as satire directed at the Times. The CD sent to RNC members, first reported by The Hill on Friday, is titled ""We Hate the USA"" and also includes songs referencing former presidential candidate John Edwards and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, among other targets. According to The Hill, other song titles, some of which were in bold font, were: ""John Edwards' Poverty Tour,"" ""Wright place, wrong pastor,"" ""Love Client #9,"" ""Ivory and Ebony"" and ""The Star Spanglish Banner.""

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN)  -- Indonesia is no stranger to bombings such as the one that rocked two luxury hotels in Jakarta on Friday. Indonesian counter-terrorist police commandos secure the damaged Ritz-Carlton hotel in Jakarta. As authorities sift through the rubble of the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels, which were struck by bombs that killed at least eight people, some could not help but think about past bombings in the Southeast Asian country. In 2002, a bombing at two night clubs on the island of Bali killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. More than 300 people -- many of them young Australians on vacation -- were wounded by the massive blasts in the town of Kuta. Dozens of victims were burned beyond recognition or blown to pieces. The bombing was blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah -- a terror group with ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network. The group is suspected in other bombings. Many of those convicted in the plot were sentenced to death or life in prison. In August 2003, the same JW Marriott Hotel that was attacked Friday was bombed, killing 12. The Australian Embassy in Jakarta was targeted in 2004. A powerful car bomb shook Jakarta's central business district, blowing a hole through the embassy's security gate, killing at least eight people and wounding about 168. A year later, three suicide bombers targeted two tourist spots on the resort island of Bali.

"(CNN) -- A Thai advisory panel has recommended an overhaul of the country's law that stipulates heavy sentences for insulting the royal family, according to a letter addressed to the prime minister seen Thursday by CNN. The independent Truth for Reconciliation Commission of Thailand said in the letter that the punishments should be less severe and ""based more on popular sentiment."" The commission has no power itself to change the law, but its views are respected in Thailand. International groups like Human Rights Watch have repeatedly criticized Thailand's tough laws against defaming, insulting or threatening the royal family. Last month, a Thai criminal court sentenced a Thai-born American to 2 1/2 years in prison for insulting the monarchy. The U.S. government said it was ""troubled"" by the case and criticized the sentence as too harsh. The recent letter to Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra was dated December 30, but it was sent to CNN and other international news organizations Thursday. In it, the commission supported the view of human rights organizations who say the lese-majeste law has been misused for political reasons. The law should be changed, the letter said, otherwise ""it may continue to be used as a political tool and will therefore obstruct reconciliation between people in our country.""

"(CNN) -- Typical solar power plants stop working when the sun sets, but a new one in southern Spain, called Gemasolar, can stay awake all night. ""During the day we capture the energy of the sun and we store that energy into a tank,"" said Santiago Arias, a mechanical engineer who helped put Gemasolar into operation. ""Then, whenever we want, regardless if it is day or night, we convert that energy into electricity."" Located just outside the quaint village of Fuentes de AndalucÃ­a, Gemasolar bills itself as the world's first commercial-scale concentrated solar power plant (CSP) that uses molten salts receiver technology. 2,650 large mirrors called heliostats direct the suns rays to a receiver at the top of Gemasolar's 450-feet tower that shines like a beacon during the day. The stored energy can generate electricity for 15 hours without the sun shining and according to Arias the plant can provide 19.9MW of power, enough for a town of about 100,000 people. From the receiver the salts are heated to enormous temperatures; around 250 to 300 degrees Celsius when it's considered relatively cool, but when the molten liquid is pumped up the tower to soak up the sun's heat directed to the receiver, the temperatures exceed 500 degrees Celsius. Those energy-storing salts are a combination of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate and are so hot that they are always in a liquid form. According to Arias each pound or kilogram of molten salt is able to store up to three times the amount of energy that can be stored in oil, an energy-store that is used at other CSP power plants. At twilight, the plants heliostats are rotated into a horizontal position, as if to get a night's rest, but the remainder of this solar plant keeps working. When the salts cool, they release energy that is used to produce steam, which turns turbines and generates electricity that is transferred to a general grid hookup at the plant. The $325 million plant began production last May and is a joint venture, between the Spanish engineering and construction firm Sener that owns 60% and investment partners from Abu Dhabi's Masdar energy company. The official inauguration is set for October 4, due to be led by Spain's King Juan Carlos and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. By the end of 2012 Gemasolar expect to reach 70% of full capacity. That, says the owners, is a rate of producing electricity comparable to conventional power plants and a rate they hope will make the plant very competitive. However this plant, and Spain's solar industry, still gets government price subsidies for the electricity it sells. ""Our vision is that those subsidies will disappear soon,"" Arias said. ""By constructing plants we are reducing the cost. At the same time, the gas prices, the oil prices, we are sure that they will go up, so there will be a certain time that we don't need any subsidy at all."" Arias can't say exactly when, but he's sure this commercial-scale solar plant providing electricity around the clock will help.","Solar power plant that can operate at night is first of its kind .

"Boston (CNN) -- Mitt Romney is a smooth salesman. When he was a candidate in 2002, his pitch to the people of Massachusetts was that he could fix all that ailed us. As the Bay State's top salesman, he said, he would ""bring great jobs here."" He claimed he would at last be the governor to reform state government. We bought it. Most of us now would warn, ""buyer beware."" Under Romney, the Massachusetts economy sputtered to 47th in the nation in job creation -- and that was in relatively good economic times. Real wages declined (while rising across the nation). Instead of helping workers and small businesses adjust to changes in the global economy, Romney cut critical work force training programs and millions in economic development funds. Instead of promoting Massachusetts to attract jobs, he used the state as a punchline on the national Republican political circuit. That's not all. When I came into office immediately after Romney, hardly anything had been fixed. He left behind a bureaucracy whose work force grew during his term, an unsustainable public pension system and a culture of poor accountability throughout state government. Young people and jobs were leaving our state. Our roads and bridges were crumbling, and his Republican predecessors' poor oversight of the infamous Big Dig project in downtown Boston resulted in billions of dollars of cost overruns, substandard workmanship and debilitating debt that he made no effort to remedy. In the face of budget challenges, what did Romney do? He raised nearly every fee and surcharge that didn't bear the title ""tax"" and cut funding for the schools. In a state where education is our calling card, Romney was responsible for the second largest per pupil cut in education funding in America during his second year in office. I respect Romney's business success. He has also always been a gentleman to me. But in his only turn as a CEO in government, he failed to deliver. His one profoundly important achievement in government -- enacting universal health care -- is something he shuns on the campaign trail, not because he isn't proud of it but because it doesn't fit his current conservative sales pitch. So what happened? How could it be that a man who set out to send the Massachusetts economy soaring into the stratosphere instead ran it into the ground? Why did a fellow who promised to reform state government fix so little? Romney sincerely believes that people are better off on their own: on their own to deal with their unemployment; with under-resourced public schools and no way to pay for college; with neglected infrastructure; with a job market that needs skills they didn't have. He does not fundamentally believe that government should help people help themselves. And he has a record as governor of Massachusetts to demonstrate how much damage his leadership does to people, their families and our future. Since Romney left, we have made very different choices in Massachusetts. As a result, we are getting very different outcomes. We are growing twice as fast as the national economy and adding jobs now faster than most other states. Manufacturing is making a comeback. We are first in the nation in student achievement, in health care coverage, in economic competitiveness, in energy efficiency and in veterans services. We have earned the highest bond rating in the state's history. Government is also smaller, and many of the programs Romney promised but failed to fix, we actually fixed. None of this is by accident. It is happening because, like President Obama and unlike Romney, we understand that government does have a role to play in helping people help themselves. We know that when government invests in the education of its people, its infrastructure and innovation, it creates the conditions for both businesses and families to grow and thrive. Most important, we understand that there are faces behind budget line items and that wise governing means seeing and dealing with the human, community and environmental bottom lines alongside the business one. Today, Romney is trying to sell the same choices to the American people that he sold to the people of Massachusetts not so long ago. Massachusetts bought it then and got slow or no job growth, stifled innovation, neglected public infrastructure, and crowded and under-resourced schools. Those choices didn't work before, and they won't work now. Like I said, buyers beware. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Deval Patrick.","Massachusetts governor: Romney failed to deliver as governor .

"(CNN) -- All big ideas start small, and Calle 13 -- a wildly popular alternative urban band from Puerto Rico -- is no exception. Its members, Rene Perez, who goes by ""Residente,"" and Eduardo Cabra, ""Visitante,"" are stepbrothers. When their parents divorced, Cabra would visit Perez at his father's house on 13th Street, or Calle 13. He was required to identify himself to enter, as either a resident, ""residente"" or visitor, ""visitante,"" in Spanish. The names stuck. ""Later, it took on another meaning, with the question of whether immigrants are residents or visitors,"" said Perez, who along with Cabra, recently sat down to talk with CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Claudia Palacios. ""But that was how it started."" Neither brother could have imagined then what Calle 13 would become -- one of the most highly praised and talked-about groups to come out of Latin America in years. It has won more than 20 Grammys and moved beyond its reggaeton roots to include instruments and sounds from all over the region, winning critical and popular praise in the process. Though raunchy, the group's lyrics are often hard-hitting on social issues, and Perez is particularly well-known for being outspoken about poverty, Puerto Rican independence and education. Asked how he views his career now, Perez said he's matured and made some adjustments so that people can better hear and understand his message. ""I liked to use bad words,"" said Perez, who raps and writes the group's lyrics. ""Because it seemed to me it gave a reality that's missing in music."" ""There are bad words in novels, in theater, in documentaries, at the movies. Why can't they exist in music?"" ""The problem,"" he continued, ""was that people were concentrating on the bad words and losing the message."" Though he'll still swear on records if the song calls for it, Perez says he uses expletives less now in the hope that his music will be able to reach a wider audience. To that end, Perez, who went to school at the Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia, said he plans to start writing lyrics in English and thinks he might live in New York one day. His words are paired with music and beats created by Cabra. Their younger sister, Ileana Cabra, known as ""PG-13,"" also performs with Calle 13 sometimes. Cabra describes the group's sound as a mix of many influences. Eclectic is a good word for it. In spite of the variety that's out there, though, Cabra told CNNE's Palacios that he thinks ""we're going through a bad time, the worst time in music."" ""Everything sounds the same on the radio, different producers doing the same work,"" he said. ""Look -- we're not making the best music in the world. But what we are making is sincere, and I think that's worth something.""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Some Christians in Iraq's capital were considering leaving, following a wave of bombings targeting members of their religion that left two dead and 16 others wounded. ""I am 60 years old and I gave a lot to this country, but this tough situation is like a message asking me to leave my country,"" said Kiyour Kizarab, the male head of a Christian family whose house was targeted Thursday in central Baghdad. ""If these attacks will continue, and the government can't stop them, then I don't think we will have a future here."" The strikes appeared to be coordinated because they all took place within an hour, an Interior Ministry official said. Explosives were left outside and in the gardens of 14 homes in six neighborhoods across Iraq's sprawling capital. Among the homes targeted by improvised explosive devices was one Muslim dwelling that was picked because it had a Christmas tree inside, the male head of the family, Ibrahim Sharba, told CNN. The assaults mirrored the early-morning bombings of Christian homes in Baghdad on November 10. There were two explosions in the east, in New Baghdad; two in Yarmouk; six in the central Baghdad district of Karrada; two in the southern region of Dora; and one each in al-Saydia and Al-Ameriya, the official said. The violence is the latest targeting the Christian minority in Iraq, which has a predominantly Muslim population. One of the deadliest attacks came October 31, when militants stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat Cathedral, or Our Lady of Salvation Church, in Baghdad. Some 70 people died and 75 others, including 51 congregants and two priests, were wounded. The violence has prompted a ""slow but steady exodus"" of thousands of Christians from Baghdad and Mosul, the U.N. refugee agency said recently. Before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, Christians were estimated to number 1.4 million in Iraq, but the violence and persecution that followed drove nearly half of them out. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Baghdad and Mosul Christians have headed to other destinations in Iraq, including the Kurdish region and the Nineveh Plains, which have a strong Christian presence. ""We have heard many accounts of people fleeing their homes after receiving direct threats. Some were able to take only a few belongings with them,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Churches and NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] are warning us to expect more people fleeing in the coming weeks."" U.N. offices in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon are reporting a growing number of Iraqi Christian arrivals. Many Christians in Iraq said they toned down their Christmas celebrations this year because of threats by militants in recent weeks. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","The attacks targeted 14 homes across Baghdad Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Washington Post critic Hank Stuever doesn't think much of the TV networks' new shows such as ""The Playboy Club,"" ""Pan Am"" and ""Charlie's Angels."" ""If the only women you ever saw were those on these shows, you would have a hard time believing that a liberation movement had ever occurred,"" he wrote in a recent review. ""It's all bunnies, baby dolls and broads -- and bridezillas and bimbos, if you get into reality TV. It's still giggles and jiggles."" I'm with you, Hank. But you know what? We are fast becoming dinosaurs. It's difficult for me to get excited about weekly reminders of a time when cocktail waitresses were paid to be sex objects, if not sex partners. Or when young, perfectly coiffed stewardesses worked 12- to 15-hour shifts wearing girdles, tight suits, high heels and a smile, no matter how rude the passengers were or how frisky the pilots. My reservations are not shared, however, by most of the 20-something women I know. The new shows, along with AMC's ""Mad Men,"" have little to do with today's work environment, they say. They are period pieces, nothing more. ""It would be like you watching Westerns,"" said Stefanie, who works for a Washington nonprofit. (Not exactly, honey. I'm not that old. But, ouch.) I asked Stefanie and her co-worker Lauren, both voracious television viewers, to talk about this latest Hollywood run on sexism that started, of course, four years ago with the ad agency drama ""Mad Men."" ""It's important to watch such shows to see how women used to be treated,"" Stefanie said. ""As in, a woman back then rarely knew where she stood. Peggy, a secretary (in ""Mad Men""), was promoted to copy writer and Joan, head of the secretarial pool, was not. It had nothing to do with how hard they worked."" Lauren agreed: ""The show helps me understand where women had to come from."" Neither Stefanie nor Lauren are bothered by the butt-shaking, boob-exposing women of ""The Playboy Club"" or by the creepy older men throwing back shots of whiskey and pinching young behinds. They were unfazed even by the comment of Billy, the manager, that he married his bunny girlfriend in order to get her ""pregnant and ugly"" so that other men wouldn't look at her. Compared to what else they see on TV -- the reality-TV bimbos on ""Jersey Shore,"" for example -- the newest babes are downright classy, said Lauren. ""Bunnies were sex symbols, but it wasn't porn like it is now,"" she said. ""Porn used to be soft-core, art. Now it's trashy."" Club founder Hugh Hefner was selling sex, Lauren continued. ""The bunnies were simply putting their best merchandise in the window. Hefner didn't create porn; he just classed it up and monetized it."" The bunnies made more money than they could have doing other jobs at the time, Lauren added, and in some cases, more than their male clients. So who really was being used? The stewardesses of ""Pan Am,"" full-figured and fully clothed, intrigue Stefanie and Lauren in part because they aren't the stick figures that populate so much of television today (including the new, vapid ""Charlie's Angels""). ""Full-figure is a healthier view of women,"" Lauren said. I had to agree, even as I squirm at the idea that the '60s look she appreciates was dictated by the suits in the airlines' corporate offices. Interestingly, the subplots I picked up in ""Pan Am"" -- predictable ""female"" themes such as sister jealousy, having an affair with a married man, spending most of their time serving food and smiling -- are not what Stefanie immediately commented on. She liked the fact that one attendant went against her parents' wishes to work for ""the world's most experienced airline,"" and that another was recruited to be a CIA spy. This suggested some depth to their characters, didn't it? Yes, I said. However, I reminded her, those attendants had gone about as far as they could within the airline's corporate structure, and if they got married or pregnant, they were grounded. True, she said, and that makes her appreciate the lack of such restrictions today. ""Hard work pays off for women now,"" she said. ""If you want move up the ladder you can."" (Just as her TV idol, Tami Taylor, did on the recently departed ""Friday Night Lights"" when the Taylor family moved to Philadelphia so Tami could become a college dean.) A dose of reality is called for here. Statistic No. 1: According to an article in CNNMoney, only 12 Fortune 500 companies are run by women, down from 15 last year. No. 2: While the wage gap between younger women and men has narrowed slightly, men in all age groups still make more than women, according to data from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a Washington think tank. No. 3: Within the last two years, among 18- to 34-year-olds, twice as many women as men have been unemployed and looking for work for a month or longer, according to a forthcoming report by IWPR. I suspect Stefanie and Lauren will, somewhere along their career paths, encounter sexist attitudes as well as disparities in salary and responsibility. But I'm delighted they are moving into the workplace with confidence. They don't have to think about feminism as often as my generation did. They were born feminist, as were many of their friends, male as well as female. They have more choices than did young women of the '60s, are paid more equitably and either laugh off or skewer men who insult them. Some of them work for women. They're coming out of the starting gate with more speed. That's a good thing, because it will soon be up to them -- and the men who support them -- to move women still further forward. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Laura Sessions Stepp.","""The Playboy Club"" and ""Pan Am"" look back before women's liberation, says Laura Stepp .
Today's young women see the shows only as harmless period pieces, Stepp says .
But in the workplace, women have still not achieved equality, she says .
Even so, women are ""coming out of the starting gate with more speed,"" says Stepp ."
"New York (CNN) -- A long time ago, by technology standards, in this very galaxy, the founders of video game developer BioWare received a phone call. It was from Simon Jeffery, then the president of George Lucas' LucasArts. In the early 2000s, BioWare happened to be looking for its next big adventure when Jeffery proposed they work on the first-ever ""Star Wars"" role-playing game. BioWare jumped at the opportunity, and it led to a pair of the most celebrated ""Star Wars"" console games, called ""Knights of the Old Republic."" On Tuesday, the studio released ""Star Wars: The Old Republic,"" the latest and most ambitious product of this so-far decade-long partnership. In this sprawling, much-anticipated computer game, millions of Jedi Knights, bounty hunters and other familiar warriors from the movies can roam and battle on their home planets, and then hop in spaceships to travel the galaxy. The ""Old Republic"" games are set thousands of years before the events in the movies, when Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader battled for galactic dominion. At the partnership's inception, LucasArts gave BioWare the option to create games with characters from the films or set during another time, said Ray Muzyka, a BioWare founder who is now the general manager of its various studios. Executives chose the latter so that the BioWare team could exercise its own creativity. The creative juices flooded for ""The Old Republic,"" which has planets full of monsters and gems, and about 1,000 actors reading 260,000 lines of dialogue for characters in the game. To build this massively multiplayer online game, BioWare has been hiring industry veterans to work at its Austin, Texas, studio over the past few years. ""It's kind of like building a whole bunch of [console games] and then building an Xbox Live service,"" Muzyka said. ""This is definitely the biggest game that BioWare has ever built."" It is also the biggest that Electronic Arts, the U.S. game publishing giant, has ever funded, analysts have said. EA has spent between $100 million and $300 million, according to analysts' estimates reported in Reuters. EA acquired BioWare in 2007, when work on ""The Old Republic"" was already under way. The project, and the trust BioWare had earned from LucasArts, played a role, Muzyka said in an interview here after ringing the Nasdaq opening bell on Tuesday, flanked by people dressed in Stormtrooper and Wookie costumes. Still, LucasArts reviews all of BioWare's concepts and designs, and occasionally overrules them, Muzyka said. Around the time of the EA acquisition, Activision Blizzard's massively multiplayer online game, ""World of Warcraft,"" was skyrocketing in popularity, while Sony's ""Star Wars Galaxies"" faltered, leaving an opening for its replacement. (EA published ""Galaxies"" in Japan, but the game's worldwide servers were shut down for good a week ago.) In addition to the initial $60 price tag, ""The Old Republic"" costs $15 per month, same as ""World of Warcraft."" (The price goes down a dollar or two when committing to longer subscriptions.) The game companies justify these fees by citing the expenses of Internet server upkeep, and of delivering new missions and items on a regular basis. This idea of constantly updating a game, even years after its debut, is new for BioWare because it has never made a game of this type before. The team has implemented a suite of data-analytics services so that it can review how people play and then tailor updates, Muzyka said. BioWare will need to stay attentive to players' demands over time. A few people who started playing weeks ago during the beta period have already reached the maximum level of 50. BioWare is not concerned that its gargantuan product has already been defeated. There are always some sleepless diehards, and developers cannot pay attention only to them, BioWare co-founder Greg Zeschuk said in an interview. Already, BioWare execs have begun discussing new features they plan to add for teams and player battles, which may be released in quarterly updates, according to Muzyka. Execs are eager because BioWare has been preparing for this type of game for more than a decade. ""We thought about doing this back in the early years of BioWare,"" said Muzyka, who started the studio with Zeschuk in 1995. ""We wanted to have all of the best-of-breed features of any MMO out there."" ""The Old Republic"" passed the first test at launch. The servers remained steady under the initial surge. But will the Force stay with them?","BioWare says ""The Old Republic"" is the biggest game it's ever built .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Just after the United States completed its drawdown of combat brigades in Iraq, militants Wednesday launched a wave of bombings across the country, mostly targeting security forces. At least 48 people died and at least 286 others were wounded in 13 cities. The locations included Baghdad, the capital, and large towns in the northern, western, and southern quadrants of the nation. The only region that appeared to be spared the onslaught was the three-province Kurdish autonomous region in the north. Investigators don't yet know whether these strikes were coordinated, but a similar series of strikes that occurred in May bore the hallmarks of al Qaeda in Iraq.  On that day, 85 people died and more than 300 others were wounded in coordinated shootings and bombings across six provinces. ""The fact that these events coincide with Ramadan only adds to extremists' desires to make a violent statement by murdering others and capturing the day's news,"" said Maj. Gen. Steve Lanza, the U.S. military spokesman in Iraq.. The latest attacks come as the number of U.S. troops in Iraq has now fallen below 50,000 -- the lowest level since the U.S-led invasion in 2003.  The U.S.-led combat mission formally ends August 31, and the remainder of American troops will train, assist and advise the Iraqis. But the American residual force -- comprising what is to be called Operation New Dawn on September 1 -- is combat-ready. While it has a different mission, it has the same capabilities as combat troops. If requested by the Iraqis, these soldiers can go into combat and can deploy these skills for self-defense. All American troops are scheduled to pull out at the end of 2011, but the Iraqi government could request that some of them remain. The departure of the U.S.-led combat mission is a seminal moment in a country that wants to see whether Iraqi police and soldiers can effectively handle the kind of insurgent activity that periodically erupts in this turbulent environment. Overall violence in Iraq has declined considerably over the past two years compared with the height of the sectarian war between 2005 and 2007. But there has been a recent campaign of bombings and shootings in Baghdad targeting traffic police, Iraqi soldiers and local leaders, and tensions across the country have been exacerbated by a political crisis -- the failure of Iraqi lawmakers to form a government nearly six months after national elections. ""Today's attacks clearly involved planning by extremists, criminals and terrorists to take advantage of the ongoing frustrations of Iraqi people with the government impasse, as well as exploit the changing U.S. mission toward stability operations that takes effect Sept. 1,"" Lanza said. Lanza also stressed that the Iraqi government needs to ""form now."" Wednesday's attacks reflect the challenges the indigenous police and soldiers face. The deadliest strike occurred in the Wasit provincial capital of Kut, a city southeast of Baghdad. At least 20 people were killed and 90 others wounded when a car bomb targeted a police station. A suicide car bomber hit a police station in northeast Baghdad, killing at least 15 people and wounding 57 others, the Interior Ministry said. The strike damaged the Qahira police station building and several buildings and houses nearby. According to eyewitnesses at the scene of the Baghdad suicide attack at the police station, U.S. troops were there. Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, U.S. military spokesman for Baghdad, said American advisers and trainers and forensic support are available to Iraqi forces at their request. In this instance, an American adviser accompanied Iraqi forces, a practice that has been routine. In Anbar province's capital of Ramadi, west of Baghdad, five people died and 13 were wounded when two car bombs exploded near a passport office. In Muqdadiya, in northern Diyala province, at least three people died and 18 others were wounded when a car bomb targeted an Iraqi police checkpoint. A parked car bomb exploded in a busy street in the Allawi commercial area in central Baghdad, killing two civilians and wounding seven others. In the holy Shiite city of Karbala, south of Baghdad, a car bomb targeting a police station killed one person and wounded 30 others. A roadside bomb explosion in central Falluja, west of Baghdad, targeted an Iraqi army patrol, killing one Iraqi soldier and wounding eight people, including three soldiers. In Kirkuk, the tense ethnically diverse city in the north, a car bomb targeted a police patrol, killing one person and injuring eight others. Other attacks left people seriously injured. A car bomb exploded outside Dujail police station just north of Baghdad and wounded 20 people, including five police officers. At least 13 people were wounded in Tikrit in a double roadside bomb attack that targeted an Iraqi Army patrol. They were five soldiers, six civilians and two policemen. A bomb explosion outside a police station in central Basra in the country's south wounded 10 people.  The chief of Facility Protection Services in Samarra was seriously hurt when two bombs went off in quick succession as his convoy passed by in the northern city. The service is in charge of providing security protection to government institutions. In Baghdad, three roadside bombs exploded, and eight people were wounded, including three soldiers. In Mosul, in the north, a suicide bomber driving a car tried to attack an Iraqi army security checkpoint but security forces shot and detonated the car. In the Diyala province town of Buhriz, in the north, bombs left outside five homes wounded at least four people, police said. Four policemen and an electoral commission official lived in the dwellings. The violence underscores the anxiety in Iraq over the tenacity of the insurgents and the progress of the Iraqi security forces. Lanza said that Iraqi security forces have shown ""an enormous will and ability to take on extremists, criminals and terrorists"" and are ""fully committed and determined"" to protect Iraqis. ""The ISF took a blow, but they are not on the ropes and will meet these challenges head on.  They are not being pushed out of neighborhoods and are not giving up an inch of ground.  When attacked, they take control of the situation and regain immediate security of the area."" Lanza said the military has reiterated ""that attacks were likely to occur during this period"" and that's ""why our top priority in our ongoing role of advising, training and assisting the Iraqi security forces through 2011 is improving their overall operational capabilities."" ""Rooting out these extremist, criminal and terrorist cells will remain a top priority for both our ongoing assistance mission and our support for partnered counter-terrorism operations in the months ahead,"" Lanza said.  ""There is still difficult work to be done here.  This is why we are staying committed in Iraq with a significant military capability to advise, train and assist Iraqi security forces until our mission ends in December of 2011."" Analysts warn that the Iraqi conflict will be persistent for years.  Anthony Cordesman, a national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote last week that the conflict ""is not over"" and ""is at as critical a stage as at any time since 2003."" Iraq, he says, continues to grapple with a ""serious insurgency,"" ethnic tension and great economic challenges. ""Regardless of the reasons for going to war, everything now depends on a successful transition to an effective and unified Iraqi government, and Iraqi security forces that can bring both security and stability to the average Iraqi. The creation of such an 'end state' will take a minimum of another five years, and probably ten,"" he wrote.

"(Financial Times) -- The collapse of Graff Diamonds' $1bn initial public offering in Hong Kong highlights the challenges facing groups that hope to list in Asia in the coming months. The high-end jeweller is the third company in the past week to pull a Hong Kong IPO, after China -Nonferrous Mining Corp, a copper producer, and China Yongda Automobiles Services, a car dealer, also scrapped deals. Formula One, Bernie Ecclestone's motor racing group, last night signalled a delay in its $3bn IPO in -Singapore, which had been planned for next month. The move came days after Ascendas Hospitality Trust postponed a $630m IPO in the city state because of ""challenging market conditions"", with global stocks falling more than 8 per cent over the past month. In the US, confidence in IPOs has been badly shaken by Facebook, whose shares have lost more than a quarter of their value since the social network raised $16bn from investors. While deals are falling apart left, right and centre, the failure of Graff to complete its large, high-profile IPO is a big blow to the Hong Kong market, according to dealmakers. Unlike recent scrapped offerings in small and unloved sectors such as resources, Graff was a big prospect in a hot sector. ""This is more damaging [than the other failed deals] because it's consumerism and consumer stuff had continued to perform well,"" says one dealmaker. ""It's a real sign that the markets really are not open for deals."" Bucking the trend, Felda, the Malaysian palm oil group, on Thursday unveiled the prospectus for its $3bn listing on the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange. Graff's failure is a warning sign for companies planning to issue equity in coming weeks. Philippe Espinasse, author of IPO: A Global Guide, said: ""Such a high-profile deal being pulled will certainly mean that issuers will now be even more cautious before launching their IPOs."" Mr Espinasse added that many companies planning offerings would need to ""revise their ambitions in terms of valuation"" and would be advised to secure cornerstone investors and anchor orders ahead of launch. Graff did not sign up cornerstone investors for its deal. Cornerstones are large investors who commit to buying a certain number of shares before the IPO is launched in exchange for a guaranteed allotment in the deal. Analysts say Graff's shares were expensive compared with other luxury groups such as Richemont, and that its lack of brand recognition among many investors was another problem. Other groups ""premarketing"" IPOs in Hong Kong at the moment include Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal, Chinalco Mining Corp International and Huadian Fuxin Energy Corp. Dealmakers says some of these deals are likely to be withdrawn or postponed unless markets recover substantially. In depth . Sany Heavy, a Chinese machinery maker, is planning a $2bn share sale in the city in the coming months, according to dealmakers, having scrapped a $3.3bn listing last September. Some 46 companies have withdrawn or postponed IPOs worth a total $7.7bn in Asia in 2012, according to Thomson Reuters. Hong Kong, the world's biggest centre for listings in 2010 and 2011, has dropped to fourth place this year, after Nasdaq, New York, and Shenzhen. Hong Kong listings have totalled $3.2bn this year, according to Dealogic, compared with $35bn for the whole of 2011. Investors in the city have been burnt by the poor performance of many deals over the past few years. Shares in Chow Tai Fook, for example, have fallen almost a third since the jeweller listed in Hong Kong late last year. Singapore's SGX exchange has attracted six IPOs this year including Bumitama Agri, another Malaysian palm oil producer, and, last week, Swee Hong, a construction and tunnelling company in Singapore. Magnus BÃ¶cker, SGX chief executive, said: ""While we do not disclose our IPO pipeline, it remains healthy and a number of companies are ready to come to the market when conditions are right."" After the Graff and Ascendas withdrawals, investors were keeping a close eye on whether F1 would press ahead with its planned float. Plans last year by Manchester United to list in Singapore were put on ice shortly after the football club notified the exchange of its intent to seek a listing, due to poor market conditions.

"(Mashable) -- Korean electronics company LG caused a worldwide stir when it announced its 55-inch OLED panel last week, and now the company has rolled out two more pictures that show you what kind of remarkable TV set this is going to be. How groundbreaking is this TV, anyway? If you've ever seen an OLED screen, all of which are much smaller than this one, you'll know how outlandishly vibrant its colors are. And an OLED screen can be impossibly thin. For instance, the one you see here is only 4mm thick -- take a look at the right side of the picture and you'll see the woman's finger pointing at the edge of the screen. On its official LG UK Blog, LG says this screen's color is even more vibrant because of its four-color pixels, making its picture more natural and accurate than other OLEDs. Each tiny pixel emits red, green, blue and white, instead of the red/green/blue used in the pixels of other OLED sets and most other TV sets manufactured today. Does that make a noticeable difference? We'll take a close look at this screen and others like it at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) next week and give you our first-hand impressions. The OLED screen (organic light-emitting diode, read more about OLED technology here) is nothing new, but here's the innovation: Until now, it's been difficult to create the screens in a size this big, at a reasonable cost and with a long-enough lifespan. The problem with this announcement is, LG is not saying when this screen will be available, how much it will cost, or how long it will last. So will this be yet another spectacular CES demo of a product that will never make it into the homes of real-world consumers? From what we've seen, LG is serious about its OLED manufacturing, where it invested $226 million in mid-2010 to create a new production facility, tripling its OLED capacity. Many other manufacturers are whispering about OLED screens. There are already smaller OLED screens available now, albeit at exorbitant prices. There are small OLED screens on millions of smartphones. This is not science fiction, folks. The promising fact: huge OLED screens can be printed onto razor-thin surfaces using a process akin to an inkjet printer, theoretically making them even cheaper to produce than today's LCD and plasma screens. And the screens have much faster response time, with refresh rates that could (again, theoretically) reach 100,000 Hz. They're brighter, lighter (this 55-inch screen weighs 16.5 lb), and can even be flexible. No question about it: You're looking at the TV the future, and the question is not if we'll see these screens available in large sizes and affordable prices, but when.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Governments around the world continue to pump billions of dollars into financial markets, but there is still no telling whether the ""injections of liquidity"" will be enough to prevent ""this sucker"" -- to quote the President of the United States -- from going down. Could 700 billion greenbacks be put to better use and kickstart a green revolution? To many people one of the more fascinating aspects of the unfolding spectacle has been the bewildering amounts of money made available by governments to avert financial catastrophe. And no one knows yet whether it will all be worth it. The same could be said of climate change. No one really knows how bad it will get, but as the Stern Report concluded in 2006 doing nothing about it now is going to massively increase the costs of mitigation further down the line. But the amounts being talked about and spent on climate initiatives by governments is dwarfed by the bailout package. Take, for example, a statement issued by the World Bank at the end of September which revealed that 10 leading industrialized nations -- including the United States, Japan and the UK -- have pledged a total of $6.1 billion to help ""Climate Investment Funds"". That's around $675 million per nation. This sense of skewed priorities was recently put into perspective by rock star Bono. Speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative, the U2 front man made a damning comparison. ""It's extraordinary to me that the United States can find $700 billion to save Wall Street and the entire G-8 can't find $25 billion dollars to save 25,000 children who die every day from preventable diseases,"" he said. So what would happen if governments ignored the un-capitalist cries for mercy spilling out from Wall Street and put the money towards climate change instead? What would $700 billion buy? Let us start at the margins of common sense. You could buy 100 billion energy saving light bulbs. At the other end of the scale, $700 billion would contribute a third of the cost towards a geo-engineering project which imagines deflecting the sun's rays away from earth. Astronomer Roger Angel believes that the bill for his idea of a vast array of space mirrors would be around $2 trillion. A slightly more plausible idea might be to oversee a comprehensive insulation program for 700 million homes or perhaps fund domestic solar panels. A $10,000 photovoltaic solar array could be installed atop 70 million homes. Much of the responsibility for our future energy needs rests on the fortunes of large-scale renewable solar and wind projects. Why not roll out a comprehensive program now? For example, the 40 megawatt Waldpolenz Solar Park in Bolanden, Germany is due to be switched on in 2009 at a cost of $180 million. The Wall Street bailout would pay for nearly 3,900 such solar farms. If wind power was the only item on your shopping list then you could afford to build 3,700 farms similar to the 90 megawatt facility being built offshore at the Kentish Flats Wind Farm in the UK, which would collectively generate an impressive 330 gigawatts. Alternatively, nuclear energy -- now back from the dead and a big favorite with energy ministers worldwide -- would see 175 new plants at $4 billion each. But as Gavin Edwards, Head of Greenpeace's Climate and Energy Campaign, points out: ""There are two sides of the coin in tackling climate change. One is to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, the other is adaptation,"" he told CNN. Using figures from the Stern Report, the IPCC and renewable energy industries Edwards gave CNN his assessment of how Greenpeace would spend the money. ""If you put $30 billion a year towards protecting forests, then that could cut greenhouse gas emissions by one fifth,"" he said. ""Another $20 billion per year is enough to spur an energy revolution and a massive uptake of green energy. And approximately another $10 billion per year would make sure we are using energy much more efficiently. ""That's about $60 billion right there for mitigating climate change."" For adaptation, Edwards put the figure at around $50 billion per year for saving lives in developing countries and continents such as Africa. ""So that's about $110 billion per year,"" he said. ""So if the U.S. Congress diverted money from the financial bailout we could have a really good head start on climate change in the next six years, if we applied the $700 billion in this way."" Read about Greenpeace's Energy Revolution here. An Economist's view . Earlier this year, Gary Yohe, Woodhouse/Sysco Professor of Economics at Wesleyan University in Connecticut participated in Bjorn Lomborg's Copenhagen Consensus exercise where global issues are rigorously debated and then ranked in terms of importance. Yohe headed a team of three economists whose task it was to calculate a workable fiscal plan for global warming. ""Almost by coincidence,"" Yohe told CNN, ""$700 billion is close to the discounted budget for the Copenhagen Consensus exercise. $800 billion, actually."" ""Allocating $50 billion to research and development (R&D) on carbon friendly technology produced a discounted payback of nearly three times that amount. ""Adding reflections of aversion to risk, as well as optimally allocating effort over time, increased the payback to more than six times the investment."" Download Gary Yohe's challenge paper here. But he cautions against spending $50 billion on R&D without economic incentives. ""We would be wasting a lot of effort,"" he said. ""We should be thinking about risks and the degree to which you are reducing risks as you make these investments,"" Yohe said. ""That's a reasonable question about the bailout as well. $700-800 billion dollars wouldn't guarantee that you are going to avoid climate change. Nor does that figure guarantee you are going to avoid significant financial trouble. But the benefits avoided are likely to be really quite substantial."" Yohe says that the $800 billion figure he drew up in his Copenhagen Consensus paper isn't necessarily the right number, but it would produce ""an extraordinary gain relative to doing nothing."" He concludes that a mixture of adaptation and mitigation approaches coupled with greater research and development into greener technology would yield the best returns on the money allocated. The bailout bill passed by the U.S. Senate now stands at $810 billion -- strikingly similar to the budget Yohe himself has been theorizing about. When the dust settles on the financial crisis his analysis may well provide politicians with a useful framework from which to start developing a meaningful large-scale climate change strategy. But climate change is going to require a lot more than just plain hard cash. ""This is going to sound North American centric,"" Yohe said. ""But I think the world is looking for U.S. leadership and if, in January, it picks up a leadership role -- accepting the notion that there is a void in leadership -- there will be a great deal of response."" How would you spend $700 billion to combat climate change? Let us know in the sound off box below.","How much would $700 billion help climate change mitigation and adaptation?

"(CNN) -- Yu Ying Ho sits on the floor of his funeral goods shop surrounded by everything you could possibly want when you're dead. There are paper versions of mobile telephones, suburban villas, even iPads and seafood platters -- all of them designed to be burned as funeral offerings. The ritual, a mixture of Confucian and Taoist customs, is meant to ease a spirit's passage through the underworld. Meanwhile, in the land of the living, making provision for the remains of the dead is one of crowded Hong Kong's most contentious issues. Soaring property prices, full cemeteries and increasingly limited space for cremated remains has given rise to a gray market in private columbaria for storing human ashes -- often in the middle of residential districts and sometimes of dubious legality. ""I don't blame these private operators at all,"" Yu says from his shop in Hong Kong's Hum Hong district. ""People are not going to stop dying and their ashes have to be stored somewhere."" Yu is one of the many operators of funeral goods and services that can often be found within a stone's throw of the city's public mortuaries. Private columbaria operators approached by CNN would not comment for this article. ""The government bears a big responsibility in all of this,"" says Yu, as he glues beads to the mask of a Lion Dance costume. ""It isn't able to provide enough space for people's remains, so how can it complain about the private operators who rise up to meet this need? ""Should people just place ashes out in the street?"" Hong Kong, however, is moving to control the industry. In September, the government published a list of 57 private operators as part of a name and shame campaign. It contends some are operating on the margins of legality, although it has stopped short of taking direct action against them. ""We have cautioned consumers that they should know what type of columbarium they are buying,"" says Hong Kong Health Secretary York Chow, whose department has published an A-list of legal operators and a B-list of operators who will need to apply for a government license. ""The government is doing everything it can to regularise the supply of columbaria,"" he told local media. ""At the same time, there are certain areas where we will never be able to accept them, especially those in residential areas."" According to the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, 42,200 people died in Hong Kong last year -- an average the department says will only increase over the coming decades as Hong Kong's population ages. What to do with their remains lies at the intersection of Chinese culture, big business and Hong Kong's perennial quest for space. The conventions of Chinese funerary culture are becoming harder to support in a city of 7 million people where, according to Lands Department figures, just 8% of the land space is useable. Burial, a widespread tradition in China for several thousand years, has waiting times of as long as 56 months for a reused plot in a public burial site, according to government figures. Long-held traditions of ancestor veneration mean that families often want a place to store ashes. This can cost as much as HK$200,000 (US$25,704) in a private columbarium, but all manner of different deals are on offer depending on the location and the size of the niche. Alternatives such as scattering the ashes are not popular, accounting for just 5% of cremations each year, according to official figures. The government has canvassed alternatives such as constructing a large central columbarium on an outlying island off Hong Kong, and even flirted with the idea of importing Japanese technology for a mechanized facility. In these complexes, families swipe a smart card and the ashes of the deceased are lifted mechanically from an underground vault to one of 10 viewing areas. The most pressing factor in the debate, however, is that anything connected with the funeral industry has a massively negative effect on property prices in the vicinity. ""I know someone who rents a 600-square-foot flat in this area for as little as HK$3,000 a month,"" says Henry Hui, whose pest control business pre-dates many of the funeral shops that have come to the neighborhood over the past 20 years to take advantage of the proximity to one of Hong Kong's largest public mortuaries. ""You tend to get low-income residents here, taking advantage of the cheap rents,"" he says. For many Chinese people, urban cemeteries and columbaria carry powerfully negative feng shui -- a Chinese system of beliefs related to living spaces and orientation -- and are regarded as dangerous places that link earth, heaven and the underworld. Contact with cemeteries and grave sites form part of a highly structured set of rites, with visits generally limited to festivals such as Ching Ming (Grave Sweeping Day) or Chung Yeung when people pay their respects to their ancestors. While the government earlier this month announced that 40,000 new urn niches would be set up in Hong Kong, new facilities are often resisted by residents whose wealth is tied up with their properties. Some have engaged lawyers and complaints range from increased traffic problems and noise, to health problems associated with burning joss paper and incense. Others have even cited climate change as a reason for closing down nearby funeral parlors where paper offerings are burned throughout the day. Hui says the not-in-my-backyard issue in Hong Kong will not be resolved until a solution is found that benefits the government, the residents and the funeral industry. ""These columbaria tend to be run by people with enormous wealth and power. While they are not in the same category as drugs and prostitution, they still operate in a gray area. You need a lot of money to invest in setting up a store,"" he says, gesturing towards an unassuming office block opposite whose top two floors house urns containing cremated remains. Competition in the funeral industry is intense and Hong Kong is now losing ground to the nearby gambling enclave of Macau in the urn storage market, Hui says. Alternatives are also appearing in Shenzhen, across the Chinese border, while some are even having their relatives' ashes stored in the Philippines, he added. For those still operating illegally in Hong Kong, however, the pay-off can be worth the risk. ""For an investment of tens of millions of dollars -- usually to rent, buy and renovate a property -- you can see a return of a billion dollars very quickly,"" Hui says. Alexis Lai contributed to this report .","Hong Kong running out of space for burials and even places to store cremated remains .

"(CNN) -- The anti-regime demonstrations pulsating across Syria have resulted in a security hunt for snipers and a wave of arrests Saturday. Syrian security forces are searching for members of an ""armed group"" that killed ""a number of citizens and security forces"" in the Damascus suburb of Douma on Friday, the Syrian Arab News Agency reported on Saturday. SANA cited an unidentified official source as saying that snipers from the group fired at civilians and security forces from rooftops. This is disputed by activists and eyewitnesses who told CNN that government snipers fired shots at unarmed protesters and government forces beat demonstrators. ""Security forces are pursuing the members of the armed group that terrorized the citizens through firing randomly,"" SANA reported, citing the source who doesn't identify the group in question. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said security forces in the volatile southern city of Daraa and in Homs arrested on Saturday about 20 people who had demonstrated the day before. Protests on Friday swept through Syria, one of the latest Arab countries to endure grassroots discontent. At least 10 people, nine of them in Douma, were killed on Friday, according to human rights activists. Another person was killed in Al Sanameen near Daraa. SANA reported that a girl was killed when the armed group opened fire on civilians in the city of Homs. Along with the protests in Douma, Daraa, Homs, and Al Sanameen, people also took to the streets in Latakia, Baniyas and Kamishli on Friday, activists told CNN. Before Friday's fighting, dozens of people were killed in the last two weeks across Syria, with many deaths reported in the southern city of Daraa, where popular demonstrations started, and the coastal city of Latakia, activists say. Demonstrators, say they are oppressed and have poor living conditions under the regime of President Bashar al-Assad regime, and that they have been targeted for simply expressing themselves. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is calling for ""authorities to release all prisoners of conscience in Syrian prisons, and stop political practice of arbitrary detention against political opponents and civil society activists and human rights, and carry out all procedures to ensure that the citizens of their legitimate right to peaceful assembly and expression of opinion and not to restrict these rights."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement Saturday he is ""deeply concerned"" about the unrest in Syria, ""where more civilian deaths have been reported during the latest popular demonstrations. Ban condemned the violence ""against peaceful demonstrations"" and said Syria should heed international human rights obligations. He added his voice to demonstrators who are calling for change, saying ""there is no alternative to an immediate and inclusive dialogue on comprehensive reforms."" Activists are upset that al-Assad failed to announce the lifting of the country's state of emergency during a national TV address on Wednesday and didn't properly address, in their view, complaints and concerns of people in the streets. On Thursday, however, Syria said it will study the idea of lifting the country's state of emergency and promptly investigate the deaths of civilians and troops in Daraa and Latakia. Al-Assad ordered the Supreme Judicial Council to form a committee that would conduct ""an immediate investigation in all cases that killed a number of civilians and military personnel."" The committee exploring the lifting of the emergency law is expected to complete the study before April 25. It will be made up of senior lawyers, SANA reported. One of the key demands of the demonstrators who have taken to the streets in the country's major cities is the scrapping of the law, which has been in place since 1963. The emergency law allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. It also bars detainees who haven't been charged from filing court complaints or from having a lawyer present during interrogations.

"Washington (CNN) -- The public corruption and bribery convictions of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman and HealthSouth CEO and founder Richard Scrushy will stand after the Supreme Court rejected their separate appeals Monday. The men were convicted in a political payback scheme. A jury found the governor had named Scrushy to a state regulatory board in exchange for $500,000 in campaign donations. After years of litigation, the justices in an unsigned order allowed the criminal convictions to stand. The specific question was whether a campaign contribution can constitute bribery if the contribution was not made in ""explicit"" exchange for a promise of an official act. Lawyers for the defendants said it cannot in their failed appeal to the high court. The Justice Department said the men acted with ""corrupt intent,"" and that the onetime Democratic governor and an aide tried to hide the campaign cash in a secret bank account. The governor had begun a campaign in 1999 to set up a state lottery, and soon after named the powerful CEO to Alabama's Certificates of Need Review Board. The lottery effort failed, and Scrushy was charged with helping cover the debt from the lottery campaign with the half-million dollars, partly in return for favorable treatment in government contracts. Birmingham, Alabama-based HealthSouth Corp. is one of the largest health care rehabilitation service companies. Scrushy was eventually forced out after the trial and subsequent lawsuits from investors and shareholders. Siegelman and Scrushy were convicted in 2006, a year after Scrushy was individually acquitted in a separate federal fraud probe involving his company. Scrushy and Siegelman eventually received about seven years each behind bars, and were fined. Scrushy remains in federal custody in Texas, but was recently sent to a halfway house in the state. Siegelman was released four years ago on bail, pending appeal. Related ""honest services"" fraud charges were eventually tossed out after the Supreme Court, in a separate case, narrowed the scope of the law, concluding the prosecution tactic was being misused as a ""catch-all' statute, added to an indictment when evidence of serious criminal conduct may have been thin. Dozens of top business and government leaders had been accused of improperly withholding their ""honest services"" from constituents and shareholders, a violation of federal law dealing with fiduciary responsibilities. The high court had allowed the unrelated conviction of Enron exec Jeffrey Skilling to stand, but limited when ""honest services"" charges could be used against business executives and politicians. The current Scrushy/Siegelman appeals were based solely on the related public corruption convictions. The cases are Siegelman v. U.S. (11-955); Scrushy v. U.S. (11-972).","Ex-Alabama Gov.

"Freetown, Sierra Leone (CNN) -- Millions of people will breathe a sigh of relief that Charles Taylor has finally been held to account for the years of violence, misery and suffering that he brought to the people of West Africa. Taylor, a former president of Liberia, was found guilty after a lengthy trial by a special court sitting in The Hague for aiding and abetting rebels during the bloody conflict in Sierra Leone between 1996 and 2002. The violence in Sierra Leone shocked the world as thousands of civilians were caught up in the fighting. Limbs were hacked off as punishment, mass killings and gang rape were common and thousands of children were forced to fight or become sex slaves. The survivors still struggle with the mental and physical scars of their ordeals. Incredibly, despite the tens of thousands of cases of documented atrocities, only 13 people have been held to account for these crimes. And, under a 1999 amnesty agreement drawn up in a desperate bid to end the fighting, Taylor may be the last to stand trial for what happened. Everyone else -- his commanders and lieutenants and fighters on all sides -- remain free to go about their lives as if nothing happened. Taylor's conviction brings some measure of justice to the people of Sierra Leone, but it is only the first step in a long journey back to normalcy for the people. Years after the end of the war, people are still grappling with the challenges and the legacies of the violence. Since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission published its report in 2004, only a limited number of recommendations on reparations have been implemented. Without a long-term, sustainable plan and sufficient funds to assist survivors to rebuild their lives, many are begging in the streets for a living. Failing to prosecute the perpetrators of crimes under international law gives the impression that they will not have to face the consequences of their actions. It ignores the distress of the victims and creates a risk of further violations. The failure to address impunity weakens state institutions, denies human values and debases the whole of humanity. Prosecutions serve to clarify the truth about what happened, establish accountability for human rights abuses and contribute to building confidence in the rule of law. Without them, victims are left to suffer without official acknowledgment of the crimes committed against them or assistance to rebuild their lives. Although the initial prosecutions of Taylor and his cronies were restricted to those individuals considered to bear the ""greatest responsibility"" for crimes under international law, the government of Sierra Leone authorities must now move to hold others to account. It must rescind the 1999 amnesty and strengthen and build an independent criminal justice system so that further investigations and prosecutions can be made. Justice needs to go hand in hand with peace. In neighboring Liberia, similar violence between 1989-1996 and 1999-2003 saw countless attacks on civilians resulting in death, disfigurement and displacement. As in Sierra Leone, government and armed opposition groups used rape and other forms of sexual violence against women and girls as deliberate strategies, as a weapon of war and to instil terror. Women of all ages were victims, including very young girls and older women. It is estimated that as much as 60-70% of the population suffered some form of sexual violence during the conflict. By the end of the war in Liberia, more than 20,000 children were believed to be involved in the conflict. Both boys and girls were abducted and forced to fight, carry ammunition, prepare food or go to the front line. In many cases, child soldiers were forced to carry out killings, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, looting and abducted and forcibly recruiting other children. Currently, there are no plans for Liberian authorities to investigate the crimes under international law committed during the 14-year conflict. Instead, the people in Liberia are expected to forgive and forget the past and just move on. But, like the people of Sierra Leone, the victims of past human rights violations in Liberia have the right to know the truth, obtain justice and be granted full reparations for what they suffered. With similar investigations now under way involving grave crimes committed in northern Uganda, Darfur and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Taylor's conviction sends a signal that authorities are finally moving to end impunity, establish the rule of law, promote and encourage respect for human rights and restore and maintain international peace and security. But official moves to hold perpetrators to account must be transparent, comprehensive and fair. They must remember and involve the thousands of victims. And they must ensure that justice is done. Otherwise, those who committed some of the most egregious crimes imaginable are getting away with murder. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brima Sheriff.","During Sierra Leone fighting, limbs were hacked off as punishment .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's major archaeological sites, monuments and museums were under the protection of the country's army on Monday, according to the nation's Supreme Council of Antiquities. However, unease persisted among Egyptologists and archaeologists, who fear some of the nation's priceless treasures may fall victim to looters or vandals, amid unrest and uprisings fueled by what protesters see as a lack of economic opportunity, widespread poverty and pervasive corruption. Egypt is ""the greatest open-air museum in the world,"" said Peter Der Manuelian, the Philip J. King professor of Egyptology at Harvard University. He said he and his colleagues are ""trying to stay on top of (the situation) as best we can,"" given spotty internet service in Egypt. Friday night, a group of ""criminals"" entered the Cairo Museum using a fire department staircase, Zahi Hawass, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told CNN early Sunday. Once inside the museum, they went to the Late Period gallery, Hawass wrote. ""When they found no gold, they broke 13 vitrines (glass showcases) and threw the antiquities on the floor."" The intruders then went back to the gallery housing artifacts from King Tutankhamun's tomb, where they opened one showcase, broke a statue of King Tut on a panther and threw it to the ground, he wrote. A group also entered the museum gift shop and stole jewelry, Hawass wrote in a blog post Sunday. A group of ""tourist police officers"" had stayed at the museum overnight, as they were unable to leave after the curfew took effect. ""These officers, and many young Egyptians who were also there, helped to stop more people from entering the museum"" during the protests, Hawass wrote in the blog post -- which he faxed to Italy so colleagues there could post it on his website in the absence of internet in Egypt. Hawass told CNN early Sunday there were nine suspects, but in the blog post he said there were 10. One of them asked the people guarding the museum for water, he said, but ""they took his hands and tied him to the door that led to the gift shop so he could not escape,"" according to the post. Hawass told CNN that when the suspects were apprehended, authorities found the remains of two mummies and some small artifacts with them.  However, he said Sunday, everything that had been damaged can be restored. It may be that Egyptian citizens' national pride in their heritage works to the advantage of its treasures, experts said. A picture was posted on Twitter of a ""human chain"" surrounding the Cairo Museum, although it was unclear when the chain was formed. In many ways, Der Manuelian said, that national pride is a tribute to Hawass' efforts in raising awareness and restoring pride in Egyptian culture. ""You may be seeing the direct result"" of his efforts, he said. ""The Egyptian people are absolutely wonderful,"" said Jan Summers Duffy, an Egyptologist at the College of Idaho and curator at the Orma J. Smith Museum of Natural History. She said she believes they can be counted on to defend museums and archaeological sites. ""With 80 million people in a country that suffers from poverty and rising food prices ... you have to expect that some people are going to be desperate and look for any means necessary to try to improve their lot,"" said Kara Cooney, assistant professor of Egyptian art and architecture at the University of California, Los Angeles, and host of the Discovery Channel's ""Out of Egypt."" But, she said, for every one of those, there are a thousand Egyptians who will defend ancient treasures. ""The people who are best able to protect these monuments are already there on the ground,"" she said. ""... I just have to hope and trust that they're able to do what they can."" Cooney said she had heard, but hadn't been able to confirm, that authorities used a mosque's loudspeaker to successfully urge citizens to come to the aid of the temple complex at Karnak and defend it from looters. On Monday, Hawass said all sites in northern Egypt, including Alexandria, were under the control of the army. Museums, he said, are also safe, along with major tourist sites in Giza and Saqqara near Cairo, and Luxor and Aswan farther south. So far, ""only small things"" have occurred, he said -- for instance, a storage magazine was entered in the Sinai area and some objects were taken. In that incident, Hawass wrote, a ""large group, armed with guns and a truck"" entered a site where antiquities from the Port Said Museum are stored and took some objects. ""Other groups attempted to enter the Coptic Museum, Royal Jewelry Museum, National Museum of Alexandria, and El Manial Museum,"" he wrote. ""My heart is broken and my blood is boiling,"" he wrote in the Sunday post. ""I feel that everything I have done in the last nine years has been destroyed in one day, but all the inspectors, young archaeologists and administrators are calling me from museums all over Egypt to tell me that they will give their life to protect our antiquities. Many young Egyptians are in the streets trying to stop the criminals."" Despite Hawass' assurances, Egyptologists said they are concerned both about damage that has not yet been discovered and about what the future might hold for Egypt's artifacts. Der Manuelian said he had heard that when Egyptian police disappeared from streets over the weekend, some sites were left unguarded. There are hundreds of storage magazines around the country, which had previously been under the protection of Egyptian police, Cooney said. Now, it is unclear who -- if anyone -- is protecting them. Reports of the incident at the Cairo Museum were ""heartbreaking,"" said Summers Duffy, who spent the summer working on a project in Luxor involving the uncovering of tombs. She said she had heard ""it was basically quiet"" in Luxor, ""but that's for now. We expect things may change."" The Valley of the Kings and other important archaeological sites are located there, she said. Summers Duffy said she is ""on Facebook all the time"" trying to make contact with Egyptologists and archaeologists she knows, to see if they remain at certain sites. Some have fled the unrest, she said. ""This has been my life's work,"" she said. ""... We don't know what the future will hold. I hope at least some things can be preserved."" Facebook, Cooney said, is ""invaluable"" as Egyptologists try to share information. Der Manuelian said most of his work is done at Giza, and he expects the site there will be well protected. There is a ""high-security wall"" surrounding it, he said, and its proximity to Cairo may result in better protection. He said he is more worried about the outlying sites. ""Some of these monuments are big, so it's easy (for a criminal) to duck behind something."" He recalled incidents of artifacts and monuments being destroyed in Iraq, saying his heart went out to colleagues who made those artifacts their field of study -- and wondered then how it might feel if it were Egypt's artifacts in danger. He had hoped he would never find out. Worries are compounded, Cooney said, by the lack of reliable information -- experts have no way of knowing whether information is solid or if they are hearing a rumor. ""Some things have turned out not to be true,"" she said. Der Manuelian said he had heard that sites in Abusir and Saqqara had been broken into. Abusir is a pyramid field on the left bank of the Nile, north of Saqqara, where many 5th Dynasty pharaohs chose to site their burial monuments. Saqqara, one of Egypt's oldest burial sites, has several royal pyramids. However, Hawass said Monday that while padlocks for tombs at Saqqara were opened, nothing had been taken, damaged or disturbed. Work at some sites is continuing despite the unrest, Cooney said, but colleagues at other sites have been asked to leave by Egyptian police. Hawass said he has faith in both the Egyptian people and troops. He told CNN that when he left the Cairo Museum -- after rushing there Saturday morning following the curfew being lifted -- ""all the people in the streets were asking me, 'Is the Cairo Museum safe? We need to protect the museum.'"" ""A very small number of people tried to break, steal and rob,"" he wrote in his blog post ""Sadly, one criminal voice is louder than one hundred voices of peace. The Egyptian people are calling for freedom, not destruction.""","Egyptian official: The army is protecting sites and museums .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptians exulted Wednesday over the detention of their ailing former president and his two sons in a probe exploring the killing of protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the center of the country's dramatic uprising earlier this year. Former President Hosni Mubarak and his sons, Gamal and Alaa, were taken into 15-day detainment Tuesday in connection with the protesters' deaths, according to Ahmed Hemeida with the Justice Ministry. Mubarak has decried accusations of his responsibility in the deaths, saying the probe is aimed at tarnishing his reputation and that of his family. The detention and questioning of the former authoritarian leader is unprecedented in the modern Arab world. Saddam Hussein, Iraq's late leader, was captured by U.S. troops and put on trial after his regime was toppled more than eight years ago -- but Mubarak's case is different because his detention didn't involve the West. In contrast to Hussein's case, the government made the arrest amid domestic demands that Mubarak be held. People on the street in Cairo saw the arrest as a positive sign. One smiling taxi driver stopped in traffic, crossed his wrists in front of himself as if he was handcuffed and yelled ""Mubarak 'cuffed!'"" in Arabic. Mahmoud Amreya, who cooks chicken and beef shawarma sandwiches over a hot grill, beamed. ""I am very happy,"" he said. Ahmed Abdulsalem, an accountant in a coffee shop, said Egypt ""has taken a big step forward"" with people regaining their dignity. ""In the previous regime corruption gave way to more corruption, and it was survival of the fittest,"" he said. ""Corruption. The country was spiraling downwards from bad to worse, in all cases. What we are living today is much better than what it was under the oppressive regime."" The developments came a day after the former president -- who earlier was summoned for questioning on corruption allegations -- was admitted to a hospital in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh after complaining to his doctor he felt unwell. Egyptian state television reported Mubarak suffered a heart attack during questioning over possible corruption charges. Egypt's health minister later said Mubarak's condition was stable enough to allow prosecutors to resume questioning at the hospital, according to the state-owned Al Ahram newspaper. A man who said he was the head doctor from a Ministry of Justice team assisting with Mubarak's questioning said late Wednesday the former leader had heart palpitations and was able to walk with assistance. The doctor, Dr. Ahmed El Sabaaei, told Egypt's opposition Al Hayat El Youm TV that Mubarak was still at Sharm el-Sheikh International Hospital in stable condition. However, Alla Mahmoud, an Interior Ministry spokesman, told CNN that Mubarak was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Cairo on Wednesday. The younger Mubaraks have been transferred to Cairo's Tora Prison, Hemeida said. Mubarak and his family were believed to have been living on his estate in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh since February 11, when he stepped down and handed power to the military. In response to accusations that his family had grown wealthy at the expense of the Egyptian people, Mubarak, in a brief audio message aired Sunday, promised he and his family would account for everything they own. He said he agreed to allow the prosecutor to contact governments around the world to take ""proper legal steps"" to reveal whether he or his family own any property or real estate outside Egypt. Mubarak was brought to Cairo for questioning last month, and Egypt's attorney general issued an order to freeze the assets of him and his family, and prohibited them from leaving the country. Mubarak had back surgery in Germany in 2004 and returned for more surgery there in March 2010. It was widely reported the 2010 operation was to have his gall bladder removed, but El Sabaaei said Mubarak had actually been suffering from prostate cancer and went to Germany to have his prostate removed. Mubarak had largely withdrawn from public view in recent years, until this year's uprising prompted him to make televised speeches. He ruled Egypt for nearly three decades before his regime was toppled by a groundswell of popular protests that began January 25. On the street, meanwhile, Mohamed Gafar, a taxi driver, said that because of Mubarak's detention he is seeing a wellspring of joy from his perch, what he called ""happiness beyond imagination."" ""The man that used to put people in prison is now behind bars."" he said. ""They were the rulers of the country and today, with God's will, where are they? In prison. In prison. Oppression has an end. Every oppressor has an end.""

"(EW.com) -- Though ""All My Children"" and ""One Life to Live"" are history, ""General Hospital"" -- for now -- is firmly ensconced in ABC's daytime lineup. But since ratings aren't as strong as they used to be -- the show's averaging a 1.1 rating among adults women 18-49, down 21 percent from last year -- and given how Katie Couric's syndicated talk show is coming to ABC stations this fall, it's still possible that the good people of Port Charles may lose their home in daytime. But it could have a future in primetime: EW has confirmed that ABC entertainment chief Paul Lee is pondering one scenario that would allow the soap to air as an evening summer series. Not a bad thought, right? Granted, it's not exactly a new idea: CBS used to air primetime specials of ""The Young and the Restless"" that averaged anywhere from 11.5 million to 13.7 million. But those aired in the '90s, when there was far less competition for eyeballs. Even then, the network realized they weren't exactly bringing the house down so it stopped airing them after 1998. It may be hard for ABC to pull off financially. At a reported $200,000 per episode, a primetime episode of ""GH"" is still a lot cheaper to make rather than an original for a scripted show (which can ring in at well over $1 million). A move to summer nights would certainly buy ABC some good will with daytime fans, who are still reeling over the cancellations of ""AMC"" and ""OLTL"" -- especially since a plan to continue them online was quashed late last year. There's always the chance that ""GH"" would stay put, but that's looking unlikely. Back when Katie Couric's talk show deal with ABC-Disney was announced, the company also said it would be giving the last hour of daytime back to its affiliates in September 2012. That's the hour currently occupied by ""General Hospital,"" which airs either at 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. across the country. Once it gives that fourth hour back to the stations, ABC will only have three to fill but four shows to do it with -- ""The View,"" ""General Hospital,"" ""The Chew"" and ""The Revolution."" (Couric will be airing on the ABC owned-and-operated stations). There's a chance that one -- or both -- of the latter programs will fail, which means ""GH"" could continue to have a spot on the lineup. But lifestyle shows, unlike soaps, are more relevant and profitable. For one, they are cheaper to make. Two, they can spawn side businesses like cookbooks. The same can't be said for the aging daytime soap genre. See the full article at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- A Yemeni oil tanker hijacked in the Gulf of Aden was freed Monday and 11 Somali pirates were arrested, Yemen's official news agency said. 11 pirates were arrested by Yemeni security forces in an operation to free the oil tanker. Three marines were wounded in the operation conducted by Yemeni forces, according to the SABA news agency. The tanker was seized Sunday on its way to Aden, SABA said. Aden is a port city in southwestern Yemen. Meanwhile, two pirates were killed and one injured when Yemeni troops freed three other ships Sunday, SABA reported. Four pirates were also arrested in the operation, it added. Piracy has become a major problem in recent years in the waters off Somalia, which has not had an effective government since 1991. Despite the introduction of international naval patrols in the region, pirates have continued to attack commercial vessels and collect large ransoms, running into millions of dollars, from shipping companies. Attacks on ships in the Gulf of Aden and off Somalia's coast accounted for 61 of the 102 attacks during the first quarter of this year. That compares with six incidents for the same period in 2008, said the International Maritime Bureau, which issues regular reports on piracy worldwide. The European Union and several nations, including the United States, have naval forces in the region to protect vessels against pirate attacks. The head of EU naval forces in the waters off Somalia said recently that restoring long-term stability to Somalia will be what ultimately stops the attacks. Rear Adm. Philip Jones said: ""It'll be a long period of time before that's successful, and we must be ready to secure the seas until that's in place.""","Oil tanker was seized Sunday on its way to Yemeni port of Aden .

"(CNN) -- A conference of Islamic prosecutors in Iran worked Wednesday to draft an indictment against Israeli leaders, accusing them of crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza. Palestinian women walk past a building destroyed during Israel's campaign in Gaza. The charges stem from Israel's late-December offensive into Gaza against Hamas militants. The Israeli military has been accused of using excessive and indiscriminate force in civilian areas. Israel is ""a regime that only understands the language of violence and force,"" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said at the gathering, in calling for the prosecution of Israeli ""criminals."" ""I am confident that there will come a day when all Zionist criminals will be brought to justice,"" he said on the second day of the conference in Tehran, the capital of Iran. The Iranian president regularly rails against Israel and has called for the Jewish state's elimination. Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said: ""The day when this conference will start dealing with human rights in the countries that are members of this organization will be the day that their claims concerning Israel will be deserved to be heard, not before. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, let alone commit suicide bombings."" ""The accusations themselves are nothing more than the hysterical, hostile coverage of the media in these countries and not based on solid facts,"" he continued. Human Rights Watch, in a report released last month, said there was evidence that Israel committed war crimes in Gaza by firing white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas. Israel has rejected that claim. Israel also has said that the offensive was to defend against repeated rocket attacks by Palestinians. The Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday its forces ""operated in accordance with international law"" during recent fighting in Gaza, but said there were a few incidents in which ""intelligence or operational errors"" occurred. This is the conclusion of probes that emerged from Operation Cast Lead, in which Israel was broadly criticized for its actions in Gaza. Phosphorus shells can be used to create a smokescreen for troops. In creating the diversion, the element ignites when exposed to oxygen and can cause severe burns. The Israeli offensive was launched December 27 and ended January 17 with a cease-fire. Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict, 1,440 were Palestinian, including 431 children, a U.N. report recently said. Thirteen Israelis died -- three civilians and six soldiers were killed by Hamas, and four soldiers were killed by friendly fire -- the report said. A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister called the U.N. report an example of the ""one-sided and unfair"" attitude of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which had requested it. The two days of meetings in the Iranian capital have included more than 200 senior judicial officials from the Organization of the Islamic Conference -- an association of 56 states. The organization might ask the U.N. International Court of Justice to charge Israeli leaders with crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza. The court would not be obligated to act.","Islamic prosecutors draft indictment against Israeli leaders over Gaza offensive .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Hip-hop has never produced anything quite like Drake -- a guy with a Jay-Z ego and a Charlie Brown soul. The Canadian singer-rapper introduced his melancholy-player persona on 2010's platinum ""Thank Me Later,"" spooling out alarmingly mellow confessional brags over synth-streaked tracks that suggested someone had spiked his Cristal with NyQuil and truth serum. ""Famous like a drug that I've taken too much of,"" he rapped, and somehow made you sympathetic to all his stardom-is-hard meditations. So, how's he feeling these days? The cover of ""Take Care"" says it all: Drake sits forlornly in the depths of a mansion he could've bought from 1970s Jimmy Page, slung over a golden goblet of $50-a-glass painkiller.

The music is grandiose, full of big names and weighty references -- from the drunk-dial epic ""Marvin's Room"" to the N'awlins hip-hop tribute ""Practice"" to cameos from AndrÃ© 3000, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne and Stevie Wonder. Where ""Thank Me Later"" was airy and spare, ""Take Care"" truly goes for it with luxe, expansive production: On ""Cameras,"" beatmaking prodigy Lex Luger provides diamond-bright high-hat clicks, low-end vroom and soulful background vocals as Drake struggles to convince his girl he's not cheating on her after she sees him in a magazine with another woman; on ""Lord Knows,"" Just Blaze laces a shake-the-sky mix of gospel choir, gauzy R&B sample and stomping beat, and Rick Ross swoops in for a hilarious freestyle: ""Villa on the water with the wonderful views/Only fat ni**a in the sauna with Jews."" There's even a funky thank-you letter to Drake's mom. Drake's 'Take Care': A Track-by-Track Breakdown . Mostly, Drake stretches out over languid, austerely plush tracks that blur hip-hop, R&B and downtempo dance music. ""Over My Dead Body"" opens the album with a dreamweave of cascading pianos and plaintive backing vocals from Canadian singer Chantal Kreviazuk: ""I was drinking at the Palms last night/And ended up losing everything that I came with,"" he raps in his finest just-woke-up voice. It's what Drake does best, collapsing many moods -- arrogance, sadness, tenderness and self-pity -- into one vast, squish-souled emotion. On the elegant title track, Jamie Smith of U.K. band the xx lays down house-music pianos, ice sheets of guitar and a sample from recently deceased R&B radical Gil Scott-Heron as Drake and Rihanna do their laid-back, realist appraisal of the love game: ""When you're ready, just say you're ready,"" he reassures. Is it going to work out? Maybe. But like most hopeless romantics, Drake favors the illusion of infinite promise over the reality anyway.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A well-known Iranian filmmaker has written an open letter calling for the release of journalist Roxana Saberi. In a letter, Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi blames himself for urging Roxana Saberi to stay in Iran. Bahman Ghobadi said he kept quiet about the arrest and conviction of the Iranian-American journalist at the request of her family. After Saberi was convicted last weekend and sentenced to an eight-year prison sentence, he said he felt he had to do something. He told CNN that Saberi, whom he described as his fiancee, is caught in a ""game of politics."" In his letter, which has been posted by the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, Ghobadi blames himself for urging Saberi to stay in Iran despite her desire to leave. Also, he writes, ""My letter is a desperate call to all statesmen ... and to all those who can do something to help."" ""From the other side of the ocean, the Americans have protested against her imprisonment, because she is an American citizen,"" he writes. ""But I say no, she is Iranian, and she loves Iran. I beg you, let her go! I beg you not to throw her in the midst of your political games! She is too weak and too pure to take part in your games. Let me be present at her trial, sit next to her wise father and gentle mother, and testify she is without guilt or reproach."" The 40-year-old filmmaker said that Saberi was planning to leave the country, but he kept her from leaving until his latest film -- which will be shown at this year's Cannes film festival -- was completed. Ghobadi won the 2000 Golden Camera award at the Cannes festival for his feature film, ""A Time for Drunken Horses."" Saberi, 31, was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one-day trial that was closed to the public. The decision prompted sharp denunciations from President Barack Obama, as well as other U.S. and international officials. Iranian officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine. The Foreign Ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper accreditation. On April 9, word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage. Saberi's lawyer has said he will appeal the verdict. Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi has ordered the head of Tehran's Justice Department to make sure the appeals process is quick and fair. Ghobadi wrote that he is ""optimistic about her release, and I firmly hope the verdict will be canceled in the next stage of the trial."" ""My Iranian girl with Japanese eyes and an American ID, is in jail. Shame on me! Shame on us!""

"(Rolling Stone) -- Rihanna has signed on to be the executive producer of a new fashion competition show being developed for British television. The show, which does not yet have a title, is set to debut on the Sky Living channel in Britain. It will be hosted by Girls Aloud singer Nicola Roberts and include appearances by Rihanna herself, though it is unclear how frequently the pop star will be on the show. ""I've always had a great love of fashion. It's a constant source of inspiration in my life, and is a big reason why I've grown into the person and artist I am today,"" the singer said in a statement on Sky Living's website. ""I have been very fortunate to work with some truly amazing designers and stylists throughout my career, and they have been instrumental in making sure my creative vision reaches the stage. I am excited to follow the journey of our aspiring contestants and see how their individuality influences their efforts during the course of the show."" The show, which will presumably bear some resemblance to ""Project Runway"" in terms of format, will culminate with a final challenge in which the remaining designers must create a unique stage outfit for Rihanna's performance at the Wireless festival in Hyde Park, England, in July.

"(EW.com) -- A North Carolina newspaper is reporting that Lowe's will not back down from its decision to pull commercials from TLC's ""All-American Muslim,"" a reality show that offers a positive portrayal of Muslim life. Its initial move to yank the spots came after a Christian group in Florida encouraged members to email the program's advertisers because of how the show excludes ""many Islamic believers whose agenda poses a clear and present danger to liberties and traditional values that the majority of Americans cherish."" ""The decision was absolutely not, despite what's been reported in the media, influenced by any one group,"" said Lowe's vice president of marketing, Tom Lamb. He said that the decision to stop advertising on the show had been made before the Florida Family Association emailed Lowe's CEO, Robert Niblock. Lamb's statements were made after the company met with North Carolina clergy members who delivered a petition from people opposed to the retailer's decision to pull commercials, according to the Charlotte Observer. Lowe's is based in Mooresville, North Carolina. Lamb told the Observer he was ""surprised"" that the Christian group was credited with pressuring Lowe's, which made the ""routine"" decision to pull the ad. A spokesman says the first spot aired December 4 as part of a bulk buy. (TLC didn't specify which shows the ad would appear in). Within 24 hours, negative feedback about the TLC show had appeared on the company's social media sites, so the decision to pull the ad was made shortly thereafter. ""We're surprised at how much happened and how quickly it happened in the context of an advertising decision,"" Lamb said. Previously, Lowe's acknowledged and defended its decision on Twitter: ""We did not pull our ads based solely on the complaints or emails of any one group. It is never our intent to alienate anyone. Lowe's values diversity of thought in everyone, including our employees and prospective customers."" Meanwhile, the Florida Family Association claims that more than a million people sent emails companies who advertised on the TLC show and asked them to stop. See the full article at EW.com.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""Black Spartacus Heart Attack Machine"" is the first single off Tom Morello's new solo album, and it's an ode to his guitar. That's not surprising for the Rage Against the Machine axeman, who was once No. 26 on Rolling Stone's list of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time."" ""I got this new steel string,"" he explains, holding up his black acoustic with a bit of pride. ""Mick Jones of The Clash referred to his main guitar as a 'heart attack machine,' and it's black, so I called it 'Black Spartacus.' "" When asked if he might one day write a real love song, as opposed to one for his guitar, Morello rolls his eyes. ""Why do people keep asking me that?"" he says before launching into an overtly sexual jam, worthy of a '70s porno flick. ""Try making babies to that!"" In the next room, Ben Harper chuckles. ""That guy's made plenty of baby-making songs,"" Morello says. Harper laughs again. He knows it's true. The two musicians have an easy friendship. For years, they've supported each other's charitable endeavors and activist causes -- which inadvertently led to their first duet, the gospel-tinged ""Save the Hammer for the Man."" It's a track on ""World Wide Rebel Songs,"" Morello's fourth record under the guise of his Nightwatchman alter ego. ""We were playing a show in Chicago for some union issue, and some of the other musicians on the bill were grousing about not getting paid,"" Morello says. ""One of the other musicians canceled the show because he had to return to his vineyard. We were on the phone kind of moaning about this, and Ben said, 'Tom, you let me know if you want me to put the hammer down.' And I said, 'Ben, save the hammer for the man.' And we're like, 'Hold on. One day, that must be a song!' "" Morello says he and Harper have a lot in common, ""from the ethnicity of our parents to quite a number of things."" Both hail from white moms and black dads. ""We like to consider ourselves the biracial, punk rock Everly Brothers,"" Morello says. In the home studio where the pair recorded ""Save the Hammer for the Man,"" the 47-year-old singer-songwriter spoke with CNN about ""World Wide Rebel Songs"" and how events in his childhood shaped his political activism. CNN: ""World Wide Rebel Songs"" has a broader focus than your previous albums. The Nightwatchman has gone global. Tom Morello:  I was not looking into a crystal ball when writing the songs for ""World Wide Rebel Songs."" I wrote the songs about a year and a half ago, and yet worldwide events have caught up with them -- from the maquiladoras of Tijuana (plants that export manufactured goods), to the unrest in Europe and North Africa. It's a record with a global focus, and it's part folk record and part rock record. CNN:  You pick up the electric guitar, which you really haven't done as The Nightwatchman. Morello: This is the first Nightwatchman record where I really play a lot of electric guitar. About three years ago, I played an electric version of Bruce Springsteen's ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"" with Bruce on stage, and it was the first time I'd ever sung with an electric guitar in my hands. I realized I could do what I do best as an electric guitar player without sacrificing the integrity of the political, folk music singer-songwriterism that I enjoy very much. CNN:  Are you getting more comfortable as a singer these days? Morello: It's a matter of playing hundreds and hundreds of gigs, and recording four records of my material. Some of my favorite singers have been Johnny Cash or Leonard Cohen -- people who may not be able to hit a high ""C"" on the piano, but whose voices contain the gravitas that makes the music feel like they mean it. CNN: This is a really autobiographical album, isn't it? Morello: While the events it speaks of are on a global level, it's also the most personal Nightwatchman record, as well. I deal in some parts of the record with my Kenyan heritage. Music, I think, is best when it honestly explores personal demons, and it stirs around in the silt of the psyche to find out what's really there. And if it's true and it rhymes, I'll put it on the record. CNN:  There's a song on this record, ""Facing Mount Kenya,"" that seems quite personal, given your family's history in Kenya. Morello: My parents met in Kenya. My father is African, is Kenyan. The Kenyan side of my family was involved in the anticolonial movement. My great uncle was Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first president, who led the movement to oust the British from Kenya. I didn't grow up with my Kenyan family. I grew up in a small, conservative suburb of Chicago. The song ""Facing Mount Kenya"" explores the pride in that country and the distance from it as well. CNN: What was it like growing up biracial in a small Illinois town? Morello: I literally integrated the small town of Libertyville, Illinois. I was the first person of color to reside within its borders, which was confirmed when the real estate agent had to go door-to-door in the apartment building we wanted to rent, asking if it was OK for this interracial family -- my mom is white and I was a 1-year-old half-African kid -- to live in the apartment building. The sales pitch was, ""Well, look, he's not an American Negro. He's a very exotic African,"" and that was something that the neighbors were like, ""Oh, that's very interesting!"" -- until I got old enough to date their daughters. CNN: Were there any incidents of racism you can talk about? Morello:  People often ask how I became political, or when I became political. When you're the only black kid growing up in an all-white town, you find your politics on the first playground that you go onto. In some ways, it was an idyllic place to grow up -- but when I was 13, there was a noose in my family's garage. There was some name-calling throughout. You know, race is not an issue that is settled to this day. In the Northern suburbs, certainly in the 1970s, it was a hot button. CNN: You graduated from Harvard. Then all of a sudden, you were a rock star. Morello: The first Nightwatchman album is called ""One Man Revolution."" It's not a misnamed album. I was the only black kid in an all-white town. Then I was the only radical student in a conservative high school. Then I was the only rock 'n' roll guitar player at Harvard University. Then I was the only dude with a Harvard diploma in a Hollywood rock 'n' roll band. So in some ways, there's always been a sense of aloneness. But where I really felt the greatest connection -- outside of close-knit family -- is playing this Nightwatchman music, and in playing it live. This is a place where I feel not disconnected in any way, but very, very connected, and it's a place that feels like home.","""It's a record with a global focus,"" Tom Morello says of his new solo album .

"(EW.com) -- People constantly debate whether the phrase, ""All publicity is good publicity,"" actually has any credence, but in the case of Lana Del Rey, the saying has proven itself true. After nearly six months of feverish online debate -- her name! her lips! her backstory! -- the divisive songstress, whose poorly received performance on ""SNL"" launched a thousand blog posts, lands high on this week's chart. Her debut album ""Born to Die"" debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, selling a solid 77,000 (if not spectacular, considering its marketing budget) copies. Impressively, Del Rey accomplished this feat without a single bona fide ""hit"" to her name. Although her recent video for ""Born to Die"" has amassed over 19 million views, she has only charted one song domestically: ""Video Games,"" and that only reached No. 91 on the Hot 100. Understandably, 74 percent of her album sales were digital downloads. Adele, of course, topped the chart once again, logging her 19th week in first place. Thanks to massive Grammy buzz, the blockbuster album moved another 122,000 copies, which means ""21"" has now sold over 100,000 units in 35 separate weeks. Yahoo's Paul Grein notes that this is the first time an album has done this since Creed's ""Human Clay,"" which logged 49 weeks of sales above 100,000 from 1999 to 2001. If Adele wins Album of the Year at the Grammys on Sunday (as she is expected to), ""21"" should easily blaze past the 7 million mark. The only other debuts in the Top 10 were Leonard Cohen's ""Old Ideas,"" which sold 41,000, and Fred Hammond's gospel album ""God, Love And Romance,"" which sold 26,000.

"(CNN) -- I've seen the future and it's amazing. What I'm about to describe has to be seen to be believed. No more tiny monitors and jerky pictures. Telepresence is designed to capture the gestures and expressions of human communication. I'd gone to the UK offices of Cisco to report on the latest innovation in the field of video conferencing, 'Telepresence'. My expectations weren't high, but what I saw was so exciting that I bored friends, family and colleagues with talk of it for days afterwards. Imagine this -- a plush, soothingly lit and acoustically treated room containing what looks like an oval shaped meeting table and eight executive chairs. A man is seated on one side of the table and as I'm ushered to a seat opposite he raises a hand in greeting and introduces himself. But as I adjust to my surroundings I begin to realize that all is not as it seems. The man on the opposite side of the table is in fact thousands of miles away in California. What I'm sitting at is, in fact, half a table pressed against three high-definition plasma screens. What I'm seeing is an optical illusion. The clever positioning of cameras and microphones coupled with the high quality image and sound, plus the fact that there is no delay whatsoever makes it utterly convincing. I can see the hands on his wristwatch and the whites of his eyes. And he is seeing the same quality image of me in his almost identical room on the other side of the world. The effect is so convincing that I constantly have to remind myself that we're not in the same room.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Airways has agreed to buy L'Avion, the French all-business class carrier and plans to integrate the airline into its recently launched subsidiary, OpenSkies. L'Avion was launched in January 2009 and employs 77 staff in Paris. The $108 million (£54 million) deal marks the departure of the last stand-alone all-business airline following the demise of MAXJet, Eos and Silverjet over the last six months. OpenSkies, launched on June 19 between Paris Orly and New York JFK, already operated a codeshare agreement with L'Avion that flies out of Orly to Newark, New York. Following integration, OpenSkies will increase the frequency of its Orly-JFK service to three daily flights. OpenSkies currently operates one Boeing 757 with 24 flat-bed berths in business class, 28 seats in premium economy and 30 in economy. L'Avion, launched in January 2007, flies two Boeing 757s with 90 business-class seats. BA is yet to decide whether L'Avion planes will be changed to a three-class layout. ""L'Avion is a successful airline that has built up a premium business between Orly and New York in a relatively short period of time,"" said British Airways' chief executive, Willie Walsh in a statement. ""It has many synergies with OpenSkies and buying it provides OpenSkies with a larger schedule and an established customer base in the Paris-New York market."" Christophe Bejach, co-founder and chairman of L'Avion, said he was happy with the deal. ""This transaction will strengthen our current base and enable the combined airline to grow faster and stronger."" Completion of the deal is expected this month and, if approved, full integration will take place in early 2009.","British Airways has bought French all-business carrier L'Avion for £54 million .

"(EW.com) -- Bob Dylan never wrote any songs about body glitter or throwing up in the closet. So one may wonder why Ke$ha appears on Amnesty International's new benefit disc ""Chimes of Freedom,"" a 76-track collection of Dylan covers that also features Adele (''Make You Feel My Love''), Maroon 5 (''I Shall Be Released''), and yes, Miley Cyrus (''You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go''), among others. But on her stripped-down ''Don't Think Twice, It's All Right,'' Ke$ha gets the song's heartbreak right; you can actually hear her sobbing between verses. If there's ever a reason to believe the girl's capable of deeper feelings than ''vaguely hungover,'' this is it. To quote from the 1964 Dylan song that gives this comp its name, Bob has always been a champion of ''the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones, an' worse.'' So it makes sense that the best covers here come from the misfits (Ke$ha), the punks (check out Rise Against's raging ''Ballad of Hollis Brown''), the outsiders (Mexican pop star Ximena SariÃ±ana's excellent ''I Want You''), and the radicals (''With God on Our Side'' finds Somali-born Toronto rapper K'naan challenging American hawkishness as only a Canadian can). Aretha Franklin calls off engagement . The savviest musicians here flip Dylan's messages for their own aims, just as Dylan reappropriated protest songs by civil rights heroes. Celtic-rock stalwarts Flogging Molly take on ''The Times They Are A-Changin' '' -- which itself was inspired by Irish drinking songs -- and reclaim it for Dublin. SinÃ©ad O'Connor recasts 1981's born-again ''Property of Jesus'' as a fiery church-reform anthem. And Carly Simon smartly plays ''Just Like a Woman'' as a feminist ballad. When she sings ''You break just like a little girl,'' it sounds like she's telling Dylan to man up. There's just one problem. That leaves 60-something more songs, and an unholy amount of strummy-strummy-strum (though you can buy digital tracks individually, and an edited two-disc version is available for $14.95 at Starbucks). Diana Krall, Billy Bragg, Pete Townshend, and other major talents opt for straight, folky readings of songs that beg for a reggaeton arrangement or a brostep remix -- anything to update the same classics we've heard a bajillion times before. True, Ziggy Marley and Michael Franti bring some freshness, but even they can't resist those bland open-mic-at-the-fair-trade-coffee-shop guitars. Where's the prankster spirit that got Dylan booed at Newport? Apologies to Brett Dennen and Dierks Bentley, whose respective rootsy spins on ''You Ain't Goin' Nowhere'' and ''SeÃ±or'' are lovely, but after listening to your trillionth fingerpicking solo, it's easy to think, ''Dylan went electric for this?'' Tracy Morgan taken to hospital in Utah . By contrast, Kronos Quartet and Philip Glass sound almost revolutionary on their gorgeous, avant-classical ''Don't Think Twice, It's All Right,'' the only song that appears twice here. It takes major innovation (and some musical-saw interludes) to create a wholly original take on an artist who reinvents his own songs every time he plays live. And maybe that's why covering Dylan seems so hard: At a time when every subway busker thinks he's the Bard, the only man who's really the ''new Bob Dylan'' is Dylan himself. B- .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A long line of hospital staff wraps around the corridor outside a small conference room in New York to catch a glimpse of the precious cargo. A worker looks at the mummified skull of King Tut in November 2007. Inside are the three frail bodies in open wooden crates causing all the commotion. Another body -- a prince no less -- is a few rooms down in a computer tomography scanner. The bodies are part of the Brooklyn Museum's collection of 11 Egyptian mummies, transported to the North Shore University Hospital to be scanned. The goal: Find out who they are, how they might have died and establish a chronology of advances in ancient Egypt's mummification techniques. The process is not necessarily new. Egyptian mummies have been exposed to radiographic study since 1896 and CT scans, which conducts imaging by sections, for more than two decades. Perhaps the most famous of them, King Tutankhamun (c. 1355-346 B.C.), was scanned in 2005 right outside the vault that holds his sarcophagus. The scan resulted in more than 17,000 images that were analyzed by an international team of radiologists, pathologists and anatomists, led by the world-renowned Zahi Hawass, the secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. The scope and ability of CT scan technology are proving invaluable in learning more about the funeral rituals of ancient Egyptians and the mummies themselves. Whereas conventional X-rays cannot clearly distinguish soft tissue from bone and can see only two planes, CT scanning can differentiate among the various types of bone and soft tissue, and reconstruct three-dimensional images that ""show fine detail inside coronary arteries down to 0.6 millimeters"" said Amgad Makaryus, director of cardiac CT and magnetic resonance imaging at North Shore, providing a better chance at diagnosis and differentiation among diseases. ""CT has proved to be exceptionally well-suited for studying the fragile, wrapped figures of Egyptian mummies, especially those still contained within their decorated plasterlike shells, or cartonnages,"" according to an article by a team of eight researchers, led by Derek N.H. Notman, published in the American Journal of Roentgenology. CT scanning is fast and non-invasive, Makaryus agrees. A scan of one of the four bodies brought to North Shore quickly revealed that the mummy named Lady Hor was actually a man. The body never had to leave its cartonnage for the procedure. In the case of King Tut, initial X-rays of his mummy decades ago showed fragments of bone inside his skull, causing speculation that he might have been killed by a blow to the back of the head. The scan immediately revealed that his skull was intact; and the team found no other indication of foul play, according to its report. ""King Tut is the icon of Egyptian history, but he is only one of thousands of mummies we can study. Through CT scans, we can, in a way, bring the dead back to life,"" Hawass told National Geographic magazine. In another famous case, a CT scan helped identify the mummy of the Pharaoh Ramses I (1293-1291 B.C.) in 2000. It had been bought from a Canadian museum by the Michael C. Carlos Museum in Atlanta, Georgia. Dr. Heidi Hoffman, a former radiology resident at Emory now practicing in Chicago, Illinois, and part of the team of scientists who analyzed the pharaoh's body, was able to observe a type of bone erosion, and ""coalescence of air cells can be seen in cases of chronic mastoiditis,"" an inflammatory condition usually due to chronic ear infections. Though easily treatable with antibiotics today, the pharaoh's untreated ear infection could have spread and caused his death. At North Shore, Jesse Chusid, director of Imaging Informatics at the Department of Radiology, said the 64-slice CT scanner takes 0.6 mm-thick sectional scans and combines and magnifies them to provide extraordinary detail. Curators of the Brooklyn Museum reached out to North Shore for the first time in 2007, to scan Demetrios, a 2,000-year-old mummy, before he was to join a traveling exhibit called ""To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasures From the Brooklyn Museum,"" opening at the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Virginia, in October. Demetrios is called a ""red shroud mummy"" because of unusual red pigment in his linen shroud. Another red shroud mummy is in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, California. There, CT scans revealed the remains of a mummified ibis, a bird sacred to Egyptians, wrapped inside. Curators of the Brooklyn Museum wanted to find out whether Demetrios had his own ibis, thought to be a sacrifice to the god Toth, whose head was an ibis. Demetrios did not have one. Still, Dr. Lawrence Boxt of North Shore University Hospital told The New York Times in 2007 that Demetrios either ""had an easy life or was carried around a lot. He certainly didn't do much heavy lifting during his lifetime."" The same was true for the mummy of the royal prince Count of Thebes, Pa-seba-khai-en-ipet. Edward Bleiberg, curator of Egyptian, classical and ancient Middle Eastern art at the Brooklyn Museum, said initial findings of his scan reaffirmed his high status: A small incision to the side of the abdomen to remove the organs, while carefully leaving the heart in place, then filling the body with embalming liquids -- all indicated a high-quality mummification process. Why the heart? In ancient Egypt, the heart was considered the thinking organ -- the center of the soul and the source of knowledge, Bleiberg said. ""The heart knows what a person thinks and feels,"" he said. ""It is supposed to be left in place during mummification so that it could be weighed against the feather of truth in the final judgment."" The images produced on the latest mummies at North Shore will have to be studied for months before researchers gain new insight into ancient Egyptian funeral practices. In the meantime, some revelations brought to light by the scans beg more questions yet: Pa-seba-khai-en-ipet seems to have a tube lodged inside him, running from his mouth through his esophagus and into the top of his chest. Bleiberg said he and Makaryus are pretty certain that was not the cause of death, and that it was inserted post-mortem. Purpose? That might be lost to the ages.","Radiologists at NY hospital analyze Egyptian mummies .

"(Rolling Stone) -- The FX television series ""Sons of Anarchy"" is known for its brutal depiction of biker life in the fictional town of Charming, California, but another hallmark of the series is its clever use of independent music.

Despite music's major presence on the show, producers have waited four seasons to release a soundtrack. ""Halfway through season two, we knew there was a soundtrack somewhere, but Fox is a big company and they had a little show called 'Glee,'"" says Thiele. ""It's hard to measure up to that."" Adds fellow ""SoA"" music supervisor Michelle Kuznetsky, ""I think that now is the right time, exactly."" And perhaps it is: season four is the highest-rated one yet for the series.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Winner of the week: The big chart story this week is rapper Mac Miller, whose independent debut ""Blue Slide Park"" sold 144,000 copies and hit Number One on the Billboard album charts. But we're more intrigued by the latest single action from Katy Perry -- last Friday, she put out the video for ""The One That Got Away,"" the sixth single from ""Teenage Dream,"" and it's killer. Perry, in old-lady makeup, sits on her bed staring into space as she flashes back to the ""younger"" Perry in a goofy romance with actor Diego Luna. The whole thing ends tragically with the perfect closing: Johnny Cash singing ""You Are My Sunshine"" from his 2003 album ""Unearthed III: Redemption Songs."" Anyway, the video premiered on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" and has since hit more than 12.4 million views. What's extraordinary is that even before that, radio was picking it up, boosting the single 38 spots up the Ultimate Chart, from 63 to 25. Look for this one to have serious longevity, given Perry's hit history this year and the video boost. Loser of the week: Justin Bieber. His ""Under the Mistletoe"" dropped from Number One to Number Six this week, shedding 54 percent (97,000 total this week). On the flip side, Michael Bublé's ""Christmas"" surged from Number Eight to Number Two, selling 123,000 copies and gaining 38 percent in sales. Bublé is clearly on the verge of dominating Christmas season. Lucky for him, holiday albums are traditional sales phenomena, as opposed to downloads -- Bublé is just Number Seven on this week's iTunes chart, and Bieber didn't place at all. Why? Our guess is that most people still have CD players in their living rooms, where they decorate trees and such, and probably haven't gotten around to syncing old-school hi-fis with iTunes and Spotify. Thus, holiday music is somewhat invulnerable to music piracy, which is why record companies love to release as much of it as possible during this time of year. As to why Bublé and not Bieber? No idea. A hearty wobble dee wobble dee wop to you, too: And finally, a word about a****. Detroit rapper Big Sean's ""Dance (A**)"" is one of the most hilariously, gloriously cynical videos we've seen in a long time -- it's all bling, booze and scantily clad ladies, plus the word ""a**"" repeated like a mantra and superimposed in various languages. The remix video contains a lengthy cameo from Nicki Minaj, who gamely shakes her own you-know-what (squeezed into Union Jack shorts, among other things) and actually elevates the video for a few seconds with her bug-eyed power-rapping. It's up to 10.5 million views on YouTube and Ultimate Chart ranks it Number 14, up from Number 29 the previous week. We don't expect it to hit bottom (sorry) soon.

"(Rolling Stone) -- When Mötley Crüe announced late last year they'd be taking up temporary residency in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel's Joint, it was one of those ideas that seemed so perfect the only question was, ""What took so long?"" This was, after all, a band whose celebration of the rock & roll lifestyle has been immoralized in a book and may still make it to film. So, what better place to lay down roots -- even for just a few weeks -- than in a town nicknamed Sin City? As they hyped the residency, Crüe promised not just the usual exploits but to take the pyro and girls, girls, girls to new levels of excess. When it kicked off this past weekend, the debauchery was no greater than usual -- women on stage several times throughout the show, aerialists and lots of confetti and pyro, but no more craziness than a typical Crüe show. After Saturday's show, drummer Tommy Lee told Rolling Stone the band is still working out the logistics. ""We're doing production s**t right up until doors open, f****** crazy,"" Lee said. ""But it's getting better. It's gonna be sick in another show or two."" The band has decided to push their creativity and musicality. There were, of course, many of the expected hits, from ""Live Wire,"" ""Wild Side"" and ""Shout at the Devil"" to ""Kickstart My Heart,"" ""Dr. Feelgood"" and the closing ""Home Sweet Home,"" which began with Lee on a piano that descended from the ceiling. Frontman Vince Neil had his own Peter Pan moment, sailing over the crowd during the song. But there were also unexpected moments, including a brief acoustic set in the middle of the show that found them all huddled together in a similar manner to U2's stripped-down concert interludes. For the Saturday night performance, the Crüe turned three songs, starting with ""On With the Show"" and wrapping with ""Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away),"" into acoustic numbers. ""Doing the acoustic thing for us is something we've been wanting to do forever,"" Lee said. Another new aspect of the performance was the inclusion of a narrator, Genocide, who worked his way through the crowd and stage, introducing the band members and providing occasional levity between songs. It's another new feature Lee was excited about. ""Being able to work the room with Genocide, our MC, we've never done anything like that in an arena, having people pop up here and there,"" Lee said. The quartet is using the stay at the Joint to live out some performance fantasies. ""We're able to place things strategically in the best place in the room, which we wouldn't really be able to do in arenas,"" Lee says. ""Being in one place for a while, we're able to really figure out how to use this building. It's been fun, interesting."" The Joint shows run through February 19, but Lee hopes the band can take lessons from the residency with them on the road. ""Now we kind of know what we're getting into here. Hopefully this'll set up something else in a bigger venue, a different place,"" he says. ""You just never know."" See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"(Rolling Stone) -- In the three years since Coldplay's last album, the world's problems have gotten a little more urgent. A cratering economy, riots from Tahrir to Tottenham, the prolonged ubiquity of the Kardashians -- these are things that can't be solved with a lullaby, even from the biggest band to emerge in the 21st century. Chris Martin knows this. But Coldplay's fifth album -- and most ambitious yet -- suggests Martin cares too much not to at least try to help. Coldplay recently entered their second decade together -- the same point Springsteen made ""Born in the U.S.A."" and U2 made ""Achtung Baby"" -- so it comes as no surprise they'd want a zeitgeist-y, big-statement album of their own. On ""Mylo Xyloto,"" the choruses are bigger, the textures grander, the optimism more optimistic. It's a bear-hug record for a bear-market world. Aided again by Brian Eno, Coldplay are still dabbling in the kind of cool-weird artiness they truly went for on 2008's ""Viva La Vida."" But where that album sometimes seemed like a self-conscious attempt to diversify their sound, with a world-music vibe and U2-style sound effects, this time Coldplay have integrated the ""Enoxification"" (as they call it) into their own down-the-middle core: Check out the cascading choral vocals that augment Martin's soaring refrain on ""Paradise."" Prominent elements prop up the sonic cathedrals: Jonny Buckland's guitar, which is riffier and more muscular than ever, and Euro-house synths that wouldn't sound out of place at a nightclub in Ibiza. Martin says ""Mylo Xyloto"" was inspired by 1970s New York graffiti and the Nazi--resistance movement known as the White Rose -- it's probably no coincidence both were about young people embracing art in times of turmoil. Here, Coldplay rage in their own lovably goofy way. On the rave-tinged ""Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall,"" Martin imagines a revolution powered by dancing kids. ""Hurts Like Heaven"" might be the first Coldplay tune to which you can bust something resembling a move. The lyrics seem to be about fighting the Man -- ""Don't let 'em take control!"" -- but Martin sounds ebullient over a sproingy New Wave beat. Explicit political statements aren't really Martin's thing; he's in the uplift business. ""Mylo Xyloto"" suggests he's fully embraced his role as a not-terribly-cool guy who's good at preaching perseverance, in a voice that's warm and milky like afternoon tea. By the time he croons, ""Don't let it break your heart!"" over ""Where the Streets Have No Name""-style guitar sparkle near the album's end, you can't help but think he's an inspiration peddler who believes what he's belting. Oddly enough, the best moments are darker ones. ""Princess of China"" is a ballad about loss and regret, co-starring Rihanna. It's a partnership that probably came together over champagne brunch at Jay-Z's, but its synth-fuzz groove is offhandedly seductive. It's followed by ""Up in Flames,"" a minimalist slow jam. Martin sings nakedly about how breakups can feel like the end of the world, or maybe it's about the actual end of the world. Either way, as end-times lullabies go, it's pretty sweet.

"Singapore (CNN) -- As part of a ""rebalancing"" with Asia, the United States will enhance military-to-military cooperation with China while also boosting the capabilities of its allies in the region, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Saturday. Panetta detailed the new defense strategy to a gathering of Asia's military leaders, saying the majority of U.S. warships would move to Asia. ""By 2020 the Navy will reposture its forces from today's roughly 50-50 split from the Pacific and Atlantic to a 60-40 split in those oceans,"" Panetta said. ""We will also invest -- invest in cyber, invest in space, invest in unmanned systems, invest in special forces operations,"" he said. ""We will invest in the newest technologies. And we will invest in new technology to mobilize quickly, if necessary,"" Panetta said. Along with enhanced military cooperation, Panetta emphasized diplomacy and a ""rules-based order"" that includes ""open and free commerce, and open access by all to their shared domains of sea and air"" -- a current point of friction in the South China Sea between China and regional nations. Panetta called for disputes to be resolved without coercion or the use of force. North Korea proclaims itself a nuclear state in new constitution . The defense secretary was kicking off his eight-day trip to Asia, geared toward explaining the U.S. strategy. The so-called U.S. 'tilt' to Asia includes beefing up the strength of its regional allies such as the Philippines and Vietnam. ""We will play an essential role in promoting strong partnerships that strengthen the capabilities of the Pacific nations to defend and secure themselves,"" Panetta said. Asked if helping the militaries of regional allies would raise the potential for conflict, Panetta said, ""I don't think we should take the attitude that just because we improve their capabilities that we are asking for more trouble."" Panetta said the United States should ""do everything we can"" to help those countries defend themselves, but at the same time, the U.S. would ""encourage them ... to abide by an international set of rules and standards and order."" Why the Chinese are flocking to U.S. colleges . The increased regional involvement by the United States has raised concerns about tensions with China and suggestions it represents a threat to China. ""I reject that view entirely,"" Panetta said, calling the U.S. shift ""fully compatible with the development and growth of China. Indeed, increased U.S. involvement in this region will benefit China."" Panetta said the United States will work to improve communication with China with an aim to ""build trust"" between the two nations. Looming over the discussions in Singapore is the conflict between China and various regional nations -- such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan -- over the South China Sea. Chen Guangcheng discusses his next moves . The South China Sea, nicknamed ""the second Persian Gulf"" because of its potential for massive oil and gas reserves, is also a key passageway for the world's oil and is home to enormously valuable fisheries. A crisis in the area has the potential for major economic damage to the United States as well. As one of the busiest sea lanes in the world, disputes in the South China Sea could have a major impact on shipping by forcing costly rerouting. According to estimates by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, $5.3 trillion of trade passes each year through the South China Sea; U.S. trade accounts for $1.2 trillion. Former Japanese leader: 'I felt fear' during nuclear crisis . There have been several disputes recently, with concern that such incidents could spark military action. Speaking to the gathering by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (Asia), which included defense ministers and top military officials from 27 countries, Panetta said the U.S. supports the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN's) development of a binding code of conduct for the South China Sea area. On the other side of the U.S.-Asia strategy is an emphasis on building the U.S.-China relationship. ""The key here is to try to strengthen mil-to-mil so that we can have greater transparencies ... and to take steps to confront mutual challenges,"" Panetta said. He said the United States was ""clear eyed"" about its relationship with China. ""We're not naive about the relationship, and neither is China. ... But we also both understand that there really is no other alternative but for both of us to engage."" ""We have also agreed on the need to address responsible behavior in cyberspace and in outer space,"" Panetta added. Panetta said he plans to visit China sometime this summer. The U.S. decision to play a larger role in Asia comes against the backdrop of rising military spending in that region while the U.S. trims its own military in the face of massive deficits. Defense spending in Asia has been projected to surpass Europe's this year. ""There is no doubt that it will continue to increase in the future,"" Panetta said. To offset U.S. budget realities, the United States will ""sharpen the technological edge of our forces,"" Panetta said. He said the U.S. military ""will be smaller, and it will be leaner, but it will be agile and flexible and quickly deployable and will employ cutting edge technology in the future."" Panetta detailed how the United States will spend its money with ""investments"" in rapid deployment technology and in capabilities that will help the U.S. deal with the realities of long distances in the Pacific such as ""new aerial refueling tankers, a new bomber, an advanced maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft."" Under required budget cuts by Congress, the Department of Defense must reduce the planned budget by nearly half a trillion dollars over the next decade. Despite financial constraints, Panetta said, there is a ""detailed blueprint"" for meeting regional goals and its fiscal responsibilities. ""Make no mistake -- in a steady, deliberate and sustainable way, the United States military is rebalancing and is bringing an enhanced capability ... to this vital region,"" he said. Also present at the conference, U.S. Republican Sen. John McCain said U.S. budget cuts will affect the outlined Asia strategy. ""At some point, and I think we are at that point, we will not be able to carry out the commitments,"" McCain told reporters. He said money for additional ships could be found by spending less on the redeployment of U.S. marines out of Okinawa, Japan, and by getting the ""cost, waste and mismanagement"" of weapons systems in the Pentagon under control.","Panetta: By 2020, about 60% of the U.S. Navy's warships will be in the Pacific Ocean .

"(CNN) -- Get ready to hear a lot more from J Cole. The rapper, born Jermaine Cole, has been making waves lately -- from rumors of an alleged sex tape with touring buddy Rihanna that the singer has dismissed as nonsense to a guest verse on the video for Beyonce's latest single, ""Party."" Not too shabby for a guy who only a few years ago was graduating magna cum laude from St. John's University in New York. The up-and-coming artist -- who was one of the first signed to Jay-Z's Roc Nation label -- recently spoke with CNN about his album, ""Cole World: The Sideline Story,"" why he needs to watch his jump shot, and who he rocks on his playlist. CNN: You've done a bunch of mixtapes and had a few false starts before ""Cole World"" finally was released. How does it feel now that it's out, and the debut was so big? J Cole: It's probably one of the best feelings I've had in a long time. It's relief. I've been carrying this since 2007, since right around when I was about to graduate college. In school, everything was a blur: fun, then partying, then homework, then rinse and repeat. Then graduation hit me, and I was like, 'Oh, snap.' From that time in 2007, until right now, my life has been full of stress like you can't believe. One moment after another of: 'I gotta get this record deal. Oh, Jay-Z likes me, how do I get him to sign? He signed me! Oh s**t, now I gotta put out an album. I finished the album -- now I gotta drop a single!' The past three years have been filled with that stress for me, like I've been under a constant heavy weight, a heavy burden. I don't jump out of bed every day and scream ""Yeah!"" but the relief is a great feeling. I feel free, for the first time in a long time. CNN: What's been your favorite night of the tour so far? Cole: This has definitely been one of the best shows I've done so far, just in terms of my performance and the crowd, the energy. I've had so many good shows on this tour so far. Like, legendary-feeling shows, so many sold-out dates. Toronto, Vancouver, Tampa, Denver, L.A., Phoenix -- so many of these places were showing me so much love. Being on tour after dropping the album and doing all these crazy shows has probably been one of the best periods in my life. CNN: That brace on your foot -- how did that happen? Was it a tour injury? Cole: In Orlando, the night before a show, I just wanted to play basketball. I went to some 24-hour fitness center and got together some people for four-on-four. I pulled out for a jump shot, but some dude stepped in front of me and jammed on my ankle. The recovery time has been incredible though. I don't even really need the brace anymore. It's just for safety. CNN: One thing that's been big on your mixtapes and ""Cole World"" is how you favor electronic, almost video game-like beats and melodies. Where does that come from? Cole: I don't know what it is. It's not really a conscious thing, like I'm thinking my raps should sound like I'm in a video game. I just really love that sound. But yeah, if you listen to, say, 'Lost Ones,' you can definitely hear a video game-synth type of sound. I really dig that kind of production. CNN: What's on your playlist when you're traveling from city to city? Cole: Now that I've got more free time, I'm getting my iTunes right, getting some playlists together. I'm all over the place. One day, I'll be listening to a bunch of Ray Charles, the next day it's nothing but Red Hot Chili Peppers. The next day it might be Tupac all day. TLC, Eric Clapton, it's all in there. Lately, I'll play what I'm working on before the show. Like, I'm working on a beat, and then I'll pause it before the show so that when I come back to the bus and hit play I can get right back into that energy. CNN: How does it feel to be headlining your own tour now after opening for Jay-Z and Rihanna's tours? Cole: There was a lot less pressure on me as an opener obviously. In that situation, it's almost like you're there to steal fans from the headliner, steal a little bit of the spotlight and make them your fans, too. When you're headlining, people are paying to come see you specifically. It's a different kind of pressure, because you've got to deliver. You've got to give these people what they paid for. It's a different mind state, a different type of mentality, but it's honestly a pretty good problem to have, you know?","Rapper J Cole among the first signed to Jay-Z's label, Roc Nation .

"(CNN) -- When he co-founded Harborside Health Center, the world's largest medicinal-cannabis dispensary, located in Oakland, California, five years ago, Steve DeAngelo's goal was to provide a safe, comfortable, organized alternative to what he saw as a broken system in the state, professional thugs on one side, irresponsible stoners on the other. ""Both options were bad,"" DeAngelo said. ""On one hand, it was just amateurish. On the other hand, it was still scary. ... I wanted to put together a dispensary that would bring together the twin ideals of my life, which are a commitment to activism and a commitment to professionalism."" The roots of activism began early with DeAngelo, who was a seventh grader in Washington when he organized a Vietnam-war protest in the form of a gymnasium takeover. By 16, he was out of school completely (""I was more equipped to educate myself than the teachers in high school were to teach me,"" DeAngelo said), and working as a street activist. Over the years, he would busy himself as a record producer and talent booker in the music industry, graduate summa cum laude from the University of Maryland and found a company called Ecolution, which sold hemp clothing and accessories all over the United States and in 21 countries overseas. DeAngelo said he was approached by half a dozen or more reality-television producers after opening Harborside, but citing their needs to ""create dramatic conflict and something sensational,"" he refused to sign with any of them. But when Braverman Productions approached, he sensed a shared understanding, and Discovery Channel's ""Weed Wars"" was born. DeAngelo spoke with CNN about his upbringing, what his show has accomplished and what he wants from this year's presidential election. CNN: Were you really born at 4:20 p.m.? Steve DeAngelo: I was really born at 4:20 p.m. It's funny, I hadn't even known that until a couple years ago when one of my staff was reorganizing my files and happened to come across my birth certificate. Sure enough, it was 4:20 p.m. CNN: Do you remember your first time smoking marijuana? DeAngelo: Yes, I remember it vividly for sure. I went to a friend's house after school, and I was ready for cannabis. I had heard about it and I had read about it. From the very beginning of my cannabis use, I was quite well educated. I probably read two or three books about cannabis before I even consumed any. My first experience was really revelatory for me. I had a little smoke at my friend's house, and then walked home through a beautiful park that had this long creek. For the first time in my life, I really became aware of myself as a creature of nature that was related to other creatures of nature. I remember to this day how the sunlight was rippling down through the gaps and the leaves of the trees. CNN: Why did you drop out of high school at 16? DeAngelo: It was mainly politics. I had been getting into issues at school because I was politically active. I didn't feel that the school system was really educating me or preparing me to do the things I wanted to do in life then. I felt that the educational system offered me a very narrow slice of knowledge and required a great degree of conformity. I felt like I was being trained to become an obedient corporate drone, which was never something I wanted in my life. I dropped out of high school on my 16th birthday. When I was 17-and-a-half years old, I took the GED and passed it with flying colors. So I actually had my high-school diploma prior to my compatriots that remained in high school. CNN: When were you approached by Discovery Channel about Harborside? DeAngelo: About 13 months ago. What happened was, as the debate over Prop. 19 heated up, there was a lot of media interest in the issue of cannabis. We were approached by a series of producers of reality TV shows, about a half a dozen, maybe more. Each one wanted us to be featured in a reality TV show, but I could tell they all had the agenda of a reality show, and I was concerned that we would not be portrayed as we really are, but in some sensationalistic kind of way. And then Braverman Productions came along, and I could tell from the first meeting with them that they had a different kind of intention, that they really did want to show us as we were, as we are. I checked out their past work that they had done, I interviewed some of the people that they had worked with, I spent a lot of time with them personally just to get to know them. When I became convinced that they were really truly committed to showing us and showing medical cannabis as it is, I decided I was comfortable doing the show with them. CNN: Do you feel like you've affected the cannabis law and public opinion with the show? DeAngelo: Absolutely. I know we've had a tremendously positive impact. We've received hundreds of letters from people all over the country and were deeply moved by the show. So many people wanted a second season, they crashed the Facebook page of the Discovery Channel. I got letters from a retired cop in Ohio who talked about how if it was 28 years earlier he would have arrested us, but now after seeing the show had his eyes opened and was thinking about checking it out and becoming a patient himself. We had a Baptist minister from Florida call up my publicist and have my publicist on the phone praying for me and my brother because he was so moved by the show. CNN: You present your words carefully: ""cannabis"" instead of ""marijuana,"" ""wellness"" instead of ""recreation."" Why is that? DeAngelo: First of all, as to cannabis versus marijuana, marijuana was a term that was popularized by prohibitionists, specifically William Randolph Hearst, who had a huge media campaign in the 1930s, an ultimately successful campaign, to make cannabis illegal. And in that campaign, he wanted to identify cannabis with the other, the foreign, the Mexican. So there were all sorts of horror stories about Mexican immigrants and African-Americans going crazy after they ingested the ""demon weed, marijuana,"" which sounded very foreign to American ears, very exotic. So I think that as we move to a place where we're leaving reefer madness behind and really taking a second, more scientific look at cannabis, it's appropriate to use the scientific terminology for the plant. As for recreation, I don't believe that very many people really, truly use cannabis for recreation -- or anybody, really. What is recreation? Recreation is not something you can smoke or something you can swallow or something you can rub on your skin. It's not a commodity. It's an experience. CNN: Who decided on the name of the show? DeAngelo: That was all a Discovery decision as well. We had actually urged it to be called ""Cannabis Confidential."" But as it turned out, (""Weed Wars"") was completely appropriate. When they first suggested the name to me, I was like, ""What are you talking about? We never call it 'weed' and it's not about a war."" When you look at the show, there's not warfare going on in the show. Except that, after filming was completed, we had the Obama administration reverse their policy on medical cannabis and the U.S. Attorneys in California, in fact, go to war against us. And episode two of ""Weed Wars"" really spent a lot of time describing that struggle, so I think that, looking backwards, the choice of the show title was actually remarkably prescient. CNN: You bring up politics and I imagine the upcoming election has you approaching your fight in different ways. Which candidate is most in line with your views? DeAngelo: I have not decided who I'm going to vote for for president, but there's two things that I know for sure: I'm not going to vote for somebody that thinks I'm a criminal and wants to put me in prison, and I will vote for the person who I'm convinced will defend medicinal-cannabis patients. Those are my two main metrics. I haven't decided who I'm going to vote for yet, but I think that the president has endangered millions of votes that he would have otherwise gotten by allowing the U.S. Attorneys to conduct this campaign against cannabis. My preferred outcome would be that the president does the right thing, keeps his original promise to the medicinal-cannabis community, and ends this federal attack on patients. That would allow me to wholeheartedly support the president for re-election. That's what I hope happens. CNN: What happens if you're presented with two candidates who don't meet your two characteristics? DeAngelo: I'll be looking at the third parties. I will not vote for someone that wants to put me in prison.","Steve DeAngelo stars in the Discovery Channel reality series ""Weed Wars""

"(EW.com) -- After last weekend's record-breaking pre-Valentine's Day frame, Hollywood is feeling hopeful about box office prospects during the upcoming holiday weekend, which will include four days of box office receipts. We're likely headed another frame of four $20+ million grosses -- possibly even five! Three new movies are hitting theaters -- action sequel ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,"" romantic comedy ""This Means War,"" and animated import ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" -- but ""The Vow"" won't relinquish the top spot so easily. Here are my predictions for the four day holiday weekend: . 1. ""The Vow"" -- $30 million . Last weekend's romantic victor has played well throughout the week -- it broke midweek records with its $11.6 million Valentine's Day haul -- and according to Fandango, ""The Vow"" is still this weekend's number one choice, accounting for 17 percent of Thursday's ticket sales -- the most of any film (""Ghost Rider"" accounted for just 5 percent). It seems that the poorly-reviewed film has become something of an event film for women -- it may not be totally well received, but people want to see it because their friends have. ""The Vow"" may fall by about 25-30 percent over the long weekend and take in another $30 million. 2. ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" -- $29.5 million . Not many people thought that the original ""Ghost Rider,"" which hit theaters over this very weekend in 2007, would earn a sequel. That film grossed just $115.8 million against its $110 production budget (a figure that does not include marketing costs), but apparently, its $228.7 million global haul was enough for Sony to greenlight a second film. Nicolas Cage is back as the flame-headed comic book character for ""Spirit of Vengeance,"" which cost somewhere in the mid-$70 million range to produce. The presence of 3-D ticket prices should add a few million dollars to ""Spirit's"" opening, but because of the tepid reactions to the original ""Ghost Rider,"" which opened with $52 million in its first four days, it's unlikely that this one will fare better. The film might ride away with a bit less than $30 million. 3. ""Safe House"" -- $27 million . The Denzel Washington/Ryan Reynolds action flick should ride its ""A-"" CinemaScore grade to a successful second weekend. Direct competition from ""Ghost Rider"" may result in a slightly inflated 35 percent drop over four days, which would give ""Safe House"" a terrific $27 million. 4. ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" -- $26 million . More than any other film, ""Journey"" will benefit from the holiday weekend. The 3-D sequel remains the top choice for families, many of whom will be eager to keep their youngsters busy over the extended weekend. A tiny 5 percent drop would give the $79 million adventure a robust $26 million, lifting its total to $59 million after ten days. 5. ""This Means War"" -- $17 million . Reese Witherspoon's last romantic comedy, ""How Do You Know,"" was a critical disaster that crashed and burned at the box office, taking in a measly $30.2 million against a $120 million budget. Thankfully, ""This Means War,"" which features ""Star Trek's"" Chris Pine and ""Inception's"" Tom Hardy alongside Witherspoon, will fare better. Granted, the film's breakout potential has been severely reduced by the complete box office dominance of ""The Vow,"" which will steal away female audiences, but on a busy weekend, ""War"" could still find a decent crowd -- it drew about $1.7 million on Valentine's Day sneaks. Fox spent $65 million on the action-comedy, which will play in 3,189 theaters this weekend, and it seems headed for about $17 million. Way further down the chart, Hayao Miyazaki's latest, ""The Secret World of Arrietty,"" which is being distributed by Disney, will follow in the footsteps of his most recent entry, ""Ponyo,"" which earned $15 million in 2009. Playing in 1,522 theaters, it may take in $5 million this weekend. See the full article at EW.com .
