"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai officials on Wednesday pulled out of planned cease-fire talks with Cambodia, hours after fighting flared up again in a bloody border dispute that has sent tens of thousands fleeing over the past week. About 27,000 people are living in shelters in Thailand, the nation's health ministry said. A Thai army spokesman said the two nations had planned meetings between their defense ministers to discuss a cease-fire. ""But before our departure yesterday, some Cambodian media misreported that our trip to Cambodia was to surrender because we were defeated,"" said Col. Sansern Kawekumnerd, the spokesman. ""So the minister thought that if we continued our trip to Cambodia today, it will bring wrong messages to Cambodia and the international community."" But the negotiation door is not closed, the spokesman said. He accused Cambodia of firing again on Tuesday night, and urged the nation to halt attacks ""to show their honesty of going back to negotiation table."" The spokesman said Cambodians unsuccessfully attempted to seize Ta Muen and Ta Kwai temples on Tuesday night, leaving one civilian dead. Thailand calls the temples Ta Kwai and Ta Muen, while Cambodia calls them Ta Krabey and Ta Moan. Much of the border between the two countries remains in dispute. Both sides claim the disputed temples are in their country. Clashes between the two started Friday as they accused each other of trying to seize the ancient temples. Thai officials say at least six of its citizens have died and more than 40 injured in the clashes over the past week. Cambodia has said three of its troops have been killed in the fighting. In February, at least 10 people were killed when fighting flared up in another disputed border area between the two nations, prompting the United Nations Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a cease-fire. Those clashes stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Fresh clashes break out as talks collapse, a Thai official says .

"(CNN)  -- A former U.S. military contractor has pleaded guilty to federal charges in a kickback scheme involving Army contracting officials, the Department of Justice said. Terry Hall, 43, of Snellville, Georgia, pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, on Wednesday, the department said in a release. Hall ran several companies that received $21 million as part of contracts with the Department of Defense, prosecutors said. ""To obtain the contracting business and facilitate unlawful payments by other contractors, Hall admitted he made more than $3 million in unlawful payments and provided other valuable items and services to U.S. Army contracting officials"" stationed at Camp Arifjan, an Army base in Kuwait, authorities said. The case against Hall stemmed from ""a wide-ranging investigation of corruption at the Camp Arifjan contracting office,"" authorities said. Hall is the eighth person to enter a guilty plea in connection with the bribery scheme. Hall's companies, including Freedom Consulting and Catering Co. and Total Government Allegiance, provided goods and services to the Department of Defense in connection with the Iraq war, according to court documents. The companies received a ""blanket purchase agreement"" to deliver bottled water in Iraq and a contract to build a security fence in Kuwait, authorities said. Such an agreement is ""an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract by which the DoD agrees to pay a contractor a specified price for a particular good or service,"" according to the Department of Justice. ""Based on a (blanket purchase agreement), the DoD is permitted to order the supplies on an as-needed basis, and the contractor is bound by the price agreed upon in the (agreement)."" Hall faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the money laundering conspiracy charge and a maximum of five years on the bribery conspiracy charge, plus a $250,000 fine on each charge. In addition, Hall agreed to forfeit some $15.7 million to the U.S. government. It was unclear when he is scheduled to be sentenced. Others who have pleaded guilty in the probe include former Maj. James Momon, who according to court documents arranged for Hall's companies to receive $6.4 million worth of orders for bottled water. As a result, Hall paid Momon more than $300,000, the Department of Justice said. Momon pleaded guilty in August 2008 to receiving bribes from contractors at the base and is awaiting sentencing. Another is former Maj. John Cockerham, who arranged for Hall's companies to receive $2.6 million in bottled water orders. Hall paid Cockerham about $800,000, authorities said. He was sentenced in December to more than 17 years in prison and ordered to pay $9.6 million in restitution. Hall was indicted in May along with Army Maj. Eddie Pressley and Pressley's wife, Eurica. The indictment against the Pressleys says they received more than $2.8 million in cash and other items from Hall ""in exchange for Eddie Pressley's agreement to take official actions to benefit Hall,"" the Department of Justice said. Eurica Pressley allegedly arranged for a company named EGP Business Solutions Inc. to be incorporated, opened a bank account in the business' name in the United States, the United Arab Emirates and the Cayman Islands, according to the indictment.","Terry Hall pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy .

"(CNN) -- Gay slurs hurled by three figures in professional sports in the last month are more than just testosterone-fueled temper tantrums, some say. The behavior, they say, is symptomatic of a deeper problem and should be used as an opportunity to tackle homophobia in professional sports. ""Kobe Bryant, Joakim Noah and Roger McDowell are not any different from many people in our society who use offensive language like that on a daily basis,"" said Jarrod Chin of the Society for the Study of Sport in Society at Boston's Northeastern University. ""These incidents provide a real opportunity for the NBA and MLB to take a strong stance against homophobia."" In April, a frustrated Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant laced a referee with an epithet that gays find offensive. Bryant quickly apologized and was fined $100,000. Bryant was apparently angry that the referee penalized him for a technical foul. In early May, Atlanta Braves pitching coach Roger McDowell made national headlines for tossing anti-gay slurs at a group of fans in San Francisco. He also made crude gestures at the fans, in full view of children who were in the crowd. After a short suspension, an emotional McDowell apologized at a news conference. And last week, bombastic Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah was captured by television cameras lobbing a similar slur at a fan after his second foul in the game. Noah apologized right after the game and was slapped with a $50,000 fine. ""When sports stars use slurs, it is especially damaging because their increased public profile means many more people are exposed. These people seem to have lost sight of the fact that in their prime, in pivotal moments in games, they are one of the most influential people in the world,"" said former NBA player John Amaechi. Amaechi knows all too well about homophobia in sports. He is credited as being one of the few professional stars to admit he is gay. But Amaechi came out of the closet after he retired. He said he did not feel comfortable disclosing his orientation during his 5-year NBA stint. Amaechi says he still remembers the pointed response from NBA star Tim Hardaway that followed his disclosure. ""First of all, I wouldn't want him on my team,"" Hardaway told a radio host in 2007. ""You know, I hate gay people, so I let it be known. I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States."" Hardaway later apologized for his statement -- but the sentiment persists among many athletes, Amaechi says. ""Sports stars need to remember that being a positive role model is as much a part of their job as making lay-ups, hitting home runs or scoring touchdowns,"" he said. Rick Welts, president and CEO of the Phoenix Suns, says he had kept his sexual orientation secret throughout his long career. Welts came out when the Kobe Bryant epithet caused a stir. He said Bryant's slur solidified in his mind that he needed to go public. ""Well, the irony of the timing is it was the day before that I had been sitting in David Stern, the (NBA) commissioner's office, to kind of discuss this with him. And then the next night, Kobe went off,"" Welts told CNN's Eliot Spitzer. ""You know, I think it reinforced that probably it was time, because I think that will probably be remembered as a teaching moment."" While his disclosure has been received positively for the most part, Welts says is apprehensive about his future and feels that he is in uncharted territory. ""I don't know what my future is. I don't know where my career is going to go,"" he said. ""I think that's part of the big problem with players. There's no example out there. No one has ever done it. No one really knows what's going to happen."" The NBA recently released a pubic service announcement featuring players Grant Hill and Jared Dudley about anti-gay language. ""Using gay to mean dumb or stupid... Not cool,"" Hill says in the commercial that is running during the playoff games. ""It is offensive to gay people,"" Dudley adds. But some say more needs to be done. ""Male professional sports do have an issue with homophobia, but so does society in general,"" Chin, of Northeastern University, said. ""The NBA and MLB are great vehicles for educating folks about this issue and could really turn these negative events into a positive teachable moment.""","""It is especially damaging because of their increased public profile,"" says John Amaechi .

"(CNN) -- A former drug dealer was executed in Texas on Wednesday night for the murders of two reputed gang members -- 15 years to the day after the crime. Texas death row inmate Frank Moore says he acted in self-defense when he shot and killed two in 1994. Frank Moore, 49, was pronounced dead at 7:21 p.m. ET, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said. ""Self-defense is not capital murder,"" Moore said before the lethal injection began, echoing his unsuccessful claims to the courts to prevent his execution. Moore did not deny firing the fatal shots outside a San Antonio bar but insisted he acted in self-defense and did not deserve to die. Moore was the second death row inmate to be executed in 2009. He spoke at length with CourtTVnews.com in 2007. Samuel Boyd and Patrick Clark were shot multiple times in the head and chest early in the morning of January 21, 1994, outside the Wheels of Joy bar. ""They came with intentions to kill me,"" Moore said in the interview. ""It was a do-or-die situation."" But no witnesses ever came forward at trial to corroborate Moore's self-defense claims. Prosecutors contended that Moore, a long-time gang member with a lengthy rap sheet dating back to his teens, shot the two in cold blood to assert his authority after a shoving match broke out in the bar, according to court records. A Bexar County jury convicted Moore and sentenced him to death, but his conviction was reversed in 1998 after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found error in the trial court's refusal to give the jury the option of convicting Moore of a lesser offense. Even so, Moore was convicted and sentenced to death at his second trial in 1999. Moore insisted he acted in self-defense when he opened fire on Boyd, 23, and Clark, 15, at a bar near the housing projects where Moore admitted he sold crack cocaine and weapons. But it was not until 2006 that a private investigator, who once worked against Moore and his fellow gangsters, came forward with information that Moore said corroborated his self-defense claims. Warren Huel, a retired Navy Seal who was in charge of the private security firm that oversaw the projects, was the first peace officer on the scene, arriving about 45 minutes before the San Antonio Police Department, according to an affidavit. During that time, Huel said he spoke with witnesses who reported that Boyd and Clark shot at Moore first from inside the car after trying to run him over, according to the affidavit. Witnesses also told Huel that they had seen the victims' relatives remove their weapons from the car before police arrived, Huel stated in the affidavit. When Huel attempted to share the information with San Antonio Police, he says the officers told him to forget everything he had seen and learned, he said in an affidavit. ""I was told that did not matter, as they already had Frank Moore, the murder weapon and an eyewitness,"" Huel stated in his affidavit. ""I was told Moore was a dope dealer and had to go to jail."" Since then, three others have come forward claiming they witnessed the shootings, providing similar details, said Moore's lawyer, David Sergi. ""Unfortunately, people from the street didn't come forward to testify at the time of the trial,"" he said. ""The problem is, the law doesn't allow for a change of circumstances."" The Texas State Attorney's Office argued that Moore's claims should be dismissed because the evidence had always been available, and was not the ""newly discovered"" evidence the law requires. A lower court sided with the state, prompting Moore to appeal to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. On Monday, the court declined to hear his claims, making the U.S. Supreme Court Moore's last chance for a reprieve. The justices remained silent on the matter.","Frank Moore pronounced dead at 7:21 p.m. ET in Huntsville, Texas .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The three security guards and the driver of an American development expert who was abducted in Pakistan on Saturday have been detained for questioning, a police official said Monday. The four men are not considered suspects at this point, said the official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Under Pakistani law, police can detain someone for up to 72 hours without charging them with a crime. Investigators have no leads in the case and are not any closer to finding out what happened to the American, whom the U.S. Embassy identified as Warren Weinstein. Weinstein was abducted early Saturday when gunmen, posing as neighbors offering food, pistol-whipped him and his driver and tied up his guards, U.S. Embassy and Pakistani officials said. Weinstein works for J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia, a Pakistani official said. He's is a world-renowned development expert, with 25 years of experience, according to his company's website. The site says he was heading what the company described as the ""Pakistan Initiative for Strategic Development and Competitiveness."" As Weinstein's security guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast early Saturday, three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the Ramadan holy month, according to senior Lahore police official Tajamal Hussain. Once the gate was opened, the three men forced their way in while five other suspects entered the house from the back, Hussain said. The men tied up the three security guards and duct-taped their mouths, he said. They pistol-whipped the driver and forced him to take them to Weinstein's room, where the men hit Weinstein in the head with a pistol, and forced him out of the house and into a waiting car, Hussain said. He said Weinstein is in his 60s. There has been no claim of responsibility nor any demands by any groups, according to senior police official Awais Ahmed. Weinstein has lived in the residence in an upscale Lahore neighborhood for several years, Ahmed said. Weinstein is a Fulbright Scholar in Belgium and is proficient in six languages, with a doctorate in international law and economics, according to his company website. U.S. Embassy officials are working with Pakistani authorities on the case, Embassy spokesman Alberto Rodriguez said Saturday. The U.S. State Department updated a travel advisory for Americans traveling and working in Pakistan this week, warning that extremist groups operating in the country were continuing to target U.S. and other Western citizens and interests. It cited part of the reason for the advisory as ""reported"" abductions of U.S. citizens ""for ransom or personal reasons,"" including the kidnapping of a U.S. citizen in Lahore in June. No further details about that incident were released. Abductions are not unusual in Pakistan, though those targeted are typically Pakistani rather than American or Western. In early July, a Swiss couple was grabbed at gunpoint while traveling in the town of Loralai in the volatile southwestern Balochistan province, provincial officials said at the time. Three weeks after their abduction, Pakistani authorities said they believed the couple was still alive. Weinstein's abduction follows another high-profile incident involving an American in Lahore. Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor, was charged with killing two men in January but was released in March after compensation was paid to their families. Journalists Nasir Habib and Shaan Khan and CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","The men are not considered suspects at this time, a Pakistani police official says .

"London (CNN) -- Personal details about Tony Blair that appear online were apparently not hacked from the former British prime minister's computer systems, but from the email account of a former staffer. Responding to a report about a hacker group that claims to have accessed Blair's personal data, a Blair spokesman said Saturday, ""This information has not been obtained from Tony Blair or any of his office systems."" ""This appears to be information from the personal email account of a former member of staff from a few years ago,"" the spokesman said in an emailed statement to CNN. He didn't elaborate on the situation. The claim by a member of the hacker group TeaMp0isoN (Team Poison) was first reported by the United Kingdom's Telegraph newspaper Saturday. The group posted the information on a website called Pastebin.com that allows users to upload text. The information on Pastebin.com appears to include Blair's National Insurance number -- similar to a U.S. Social Security Number -- and the addresses and phone numbers of numerous personal contacts. The document has a note at the top that reads: ""The information in this article was obtained in 2010 December, we still have access to the webmail server, phone numbers may have changed but all the information is 100% legit."" It claims to include information on members of Blair's office, his address and phone book -- including the details of ""family, friends, MPs and lords"" -- and the contact details and resume of his former special adviser Katie Kay. CNN was not able to verify the authenticity of the information published on Pastebin.com. The PC Magazine website reported that the material had been leaked by a member of Team Poison known as TriCk. According to posts on TriCk's Twitter feed Friday night, the hacker group obtained the information in December. ""Tony Blair's Private Info is getting leaked tonight, so is his Personal Adivsors CV and UK MPs & Lords who supported the war in iraq,"" one of the Twitter post said. An hour later, another post read: ""doing the writeup now - Tony Blair and his cockroaches are getting owned tonight. - War IS Terror."" This week, members of the Team Poison hacker group appeared to step into a row over recent actions by hacker group Lulz Security, tweeting that it would expose the identities of its members. LulzSec published Arizona police documents Thursday, obtained by hacking the Arizona Department of Public Safety. The agency confirmed it had been the victim of a cyber attack by LulzSec. The group has also claimed attacks on websites belonging to the CIA, the U.S. Senate and the United Kingdom's Serious Organised Crime Agency. It also obtained more than 1 million e-mail addresses, passwords and other personal information from the U.S.-based Sony Pictures. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","Spokesman for Tony Blair's office denies the systems of former PM have been hacked .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities deployed more than 1,000 additional police officers to reinforce security at the capital's 175 subway stations on Saturday, a day after a shooting inside a station left two people dead and eight injured at the height of evening rush hour. Camera footage shows Luis Felipe Hernandez Castillo brandishing a gun. The shooting at the Balderas station in central Mexico City happened after police stopped Luis Felipe Hernandez Castillo, 38, from writing graffiti on the wall of one of the subway platforms. Five of the injured suffered gunshot wounds, and three others were hurt by the stampeding crowds, officials said. Hernandez Castillo was writing ""Este gobierno de criminales,"" or ""this government of criminals,"" Mexico City district attorney Miguel Angel Mancera said. As police tried to stop him, Hernandez Castillo drew a .38 special handgun and began firing. Mancera said his first impression of Hernandez Castillo is that he may suffer from mental illness. ""One moment he is talking about global warming and then about the message of the Bible and suddenly he focuses on some government,"" Mancera said. Authorities identified Hernandez Castillo as an agriculturalist from the state of Jalisco. Hernandez Castillo also told investigators that he believed a great famine would come, and he traveled to Mexico City to relay a message, Mancera said. Earlier this month, a Bolivian pastor hijacked a passenger jet in Mexico City with a fake bomb, claiming that he acted on a divine revelation to warn people of a forthcoming earthquake. Mancera said Hernandez Castillo was aware of the hijacking, but that the two events were not connected. Hernandez Castillo said he opened fire because he saw the police as a threat to his task of writing on the wall, Mancera said. Preliminary tests show that Hernandez Castillo was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the incident, Mancera said. The Mexican government on Saturday posted security camera footage of the shooting. It shows a busy subway platform as the train pulls into the station just before 5:15 p.m. Friday. As the train comes to a stop, there is a disturbance in the crowd, and Hernandez Castillo is seen shooting at an officer.  Watch the dramatic incident unfold » . The crowd disperses, and the officer runs out of view of the camera. The officer, who was a bank policeman, is later seen on the footage lying dead, face down on the platform. Authorities identified the officer as Victor Manuel Miranda Martinez. The footage shows a man in a white shirt running off the train and trying to wrestle Hernandez Castillo. The man chases Hernandez Castillo around the platform. He frequently falls either because he slips or is trying to avoid being shot. The man is on the floor facing Hernandez Castillo, about to get up and try to grab him, when he is shot in the head and falls to the ground. Mancera initially said the man was a federal security agent in plain clothes, but later clarified that the man was a civilian, a 58-year-old construction worker. A scattered handful of people remain on the subway platform during the shooting. Some stay on the train. Others walk on the platform very close to the shooter, seemingly undisturbed. Seven minutes later, the camera pans out to show the construction worker lying on his back and the bank police officer in the foreground. Hernandez Castillo remains on the train, occasionally firing his gun and peeking out of the train. At 5:23 p.m., the camera shows first one, then two, then three plain-clothes police getting into position on the platform. Within moments they rush Hernandez Castillo and pull him out of the train, with nearly a dozen police officers then wrestling him to the ground. Hernandez Castillo was treated at a hospital for a bullet wound to the right shoulder before being transferred to the local attorney general's office, a common place to hold prisoners during preliminary investigations, a spokesman for the attorney general said. He faces two counts of murder and one count each of attempted murder, aggression, resisting arrest and disturbing the peace, said the spokesman, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the press. CNN's Esprit Smith in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Shooting took place at the Balderas station in central Mexico City .

"(CNN) -- A man stranded after his car plunged down a steep embankment in the Angeles National Forest survived for six days by eating leaves and drinking water from a creek, authorities said Friday. David J. Lavau, 67, of Lake Hughes, California, was found in a ravine a week after losing control of his car on a rural road and plunging 500 feet down an embankment into heavy brush, according to a report by the California Highway Patrol. Lavau, who is partially disabled, told authorities that he spent the first night in his car. ""The next morning, he exited his vehicle and observed another vehicle adjacent to his own with a deceased male driver behind the wheel,"" the report said. ""The deceased appeared to have been there for some time."" Authorities say they have not identified the dead driver. The case began to unfold on September 23, when Lavau failed to return home. Lavau's family began searching for him when he failed to return home, driving the route and stopping at all the curves in the road from Castaic to his home in Lake Hughes. While Lavau's family searched for him, he ""remained at the bottom of the hill surviving on leaves and water from a nearby creek,"" the report said. Lavau's son, Sean, found his father after hearing ""faint yells for help on the roadway from the canyon below,"" according to the report. Sean Lavau hiked to the bottom of the canyon to find his father, the report said. The Los Angeles County Fire Department rescued Lavau and his son from the ravine. Lavau was taken to an area hospital where he was treated for moderate injuries, the report said. The CHP said Lavau's accident and the one involving the dead driver are under investigation.

"Yazoo City, Mississippi (CNN) -- Rescue crews in Mississippi continued to search for survivors Sunday from a powerful tornado that ripped through the state a day earlier, killing 10 people, injuring dozens of others and leveling scores of homes. Two children and a 3-month-old baby were among the victims. Two sisters, 9 and 14, were killed inside a mobile home, Choctaw County Coroner Keith Coleman told CNN. The tornado tore a path nearly a mile wide and decimated neighborhoods as it raked cities from the central western border with Louisiana northeastward to Alabama. It leveled a church, sheared roofs off houses, overturned cars, snapped down hundreds of trees and plunged large swaths of the state in darkness as it toppled power lines. The same storm system that unleashed Saturday's twister delivered severe weather to other parts of the South on Sunday, with tornadoes hitting Alabama and South Carolina. On Sunday, a tornado in Darlington County in northern South Carolina overturned as many as four mobile homes and toppled trees and downed power lines. Three people were hospitalized with minor injuries, according to Linwood Epps of the county's emergency management agency. He said that the local Cain Elementary school was damaged, with part of its roof missing. The National Weather Service on Sunday gave the Mississippi tornado a preliminary rating of at least 3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale of 0-5, with wind speeds of up to 160 miles per hour and a preliminary path width of one and a half miles. Were you affected by the tornado? Send in pics, video . Ron Sullivan, a store owner in Choctaw County, said he was lucky to be alive after the storm hit around midday Saturday. ""They always talk about you hearing the train,"" Sullivan told CNN. ""There was no train. There was a bomb."" He said two customers were walking toward the door of his store when the tornado struck and that ""when they opened the door, it hit and blew me back."" ""The only thing that went through my mind were two things -- 'Please don't let anything else fall on me' and 'I hope my wife is OK,' "" Sullivan said. The hardest-hit counties were Yazoo and Choctaw, where assessment and rescue crews continued operations Sunday, though a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said there weren't any specific reports of people trapped inside the rubble. Authorities had recorded at least 681 homes damaged across six counties, according to MEMA spokesman Greg Flynn. The agency was reporting 33 injuries, but it hadn't received counts from Yazoo and Choctaw counties. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said he has not yet requested emergency federal aid but plans to do so on Monday. Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were scheduled to arrive Monday, anticipating an application for a disaster declaration, Flynn said. Nearly 80 Mississippi National Guard troops, including 50 military police, had been deployed to Choctaw and Yazoo counties, MEMA reported. Forty highway safety patrol troops were also sent to the affected areas. Five of the dead were from Choctaw County, in the north central part of the state; four were from Yazoo County, north of Jackson; and one was from Holmes County, also in north central Mississippi, said Flynn. Barbour, who was in Yazoo City where his home is located, called the twister gigantic and said that ""in places (it) seemed to be to be several miles wide."" Only 38 people stayed overnight in shelters in Yazoo City, Flynn said, adding that most of the affected were able to stay with family or friends. Mississippi residents shared stories of tragedy and survival on Sunday. ""You could just feel the glass and debris flying in and cutting you,"" said Stacy Walker, who took cover in a hair salon in Yazoo City where she worked. ""It felt like minutes and minutes. but I'm sure it was just seconds the time that it lasted."" Walker made it out safe but later learned that a high school friend died protecting her children. Dale Thrasher was inside Yazoo City's Hillcrest Baptist Church when it was flattened by the tornado. ""I went in the sanctuary and got under the pulpit table and the whole building fell around me,"" he said. His injuries: ""Three little scratches."" In all, 12 counties reported injuries, with some of the injured airlifted to a level one trauma center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. Local coverage from CNN affiliate WAPT . President Obama has ""been briefed on the tragedy in Mississippi and the situation is being followed by the White House,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton said. Mississippi residents reported that the path of the twister was a half-mile to a mile wide, said Mark McAllister, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Jackson. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the twister  had traveled 150 miles across Mississippi, starting in the western part of the state and moving northeast before weakening as it moved into Alabama. Early Sunday morning, Alabama's emergency management officials confirmed a tornado touched down in Marshall County in the state's north. At least one mobile home park and some homes in Albertville were destroyed, said CNN affiliate WAFF in Huntsville, Alabama. On Sunday, Nancy Brooks surveyed the damage to her Albertville home, which was extensive. Part of home's roof was blown off, and debris littered the floors, which were now barely visible. Brooks awoke to the sound of the incoming tornado, only to witness a moment later a large tree branch rip into her bedroom just feet from where she sleeps. ""I'm very lucky, I'm very fortunate,"" she said, as friends helped her begin the cleanup process. Saturday's tornado was part of a broad band of storms that stretched from Missouri to the panhandle of Florida, Jeras said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Obama administration will ask Congress for another $83.4 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through the end of September, Democratic congressional sources said Thursday. President Obama's spending measure is likely to be the last supplemental request submitted to pay for the wars. The request is expected to pay for those conflicts for the rest of the 2009 budget year, two Democratic congressional sources said. The money would bring the running tab for both conflicts to about $947 billion, according to figures from the Congressional Research Service. More than three-quarters of the $864 billion appropriated so far has gone to the war in Iraq, the agency estimated. Since taking office in January, President Obama has announced plans to shift troops out of Iraq and beef up U.S. forces in Afghanistan, where American troops have been battling al Qaeda and Taliban fighters since al Qaeda's 2001 attacks. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Obama said the situation in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan ""demands urgent attention."" ""The Taliban is resurgent, and al Qaeda threatens America from its safe haven along the Afghan-Pakistan border,"" Obama wrote in submitting the funding request. ""There is no question of the resolve of our military women and men. Yet, in Afghanistan, that resolve has not been matched by a comprehensive strategy and sufficient resources,"" Obama wrote. About $75 billion of the latest request would pay for military operations, including $9.8 billion for body armor and protective vehicles and $11.6 billion to replace worn-out equipment. The rest would go to diplomatic programs and development aid -- including $1.6 billion for Afghanistan, $1.4 billion for Pakistan and $700 million for Iraq. The request would also provide about $800 million for the Palestinian Authority, including humanitarian aid for Gaza, the Hamas-ruled territory that was heavily bombarded by Israel in December and January; $800 million to support U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa; and $30 million to the Department of Justice to manage the closure of the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The supplemental spending bill is likely to be the last such request submitted to Congress to pay for the wars, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. While the Bush administration relied on supplemental spending bills to fund the conflicts, Obama began including war spending in his 2010 budget. The president urged Congress to move quickly on the request ""and not to use the supplemental to pursue unnecessary spending."" But Rep. Lynn Woolsey, a prominent anti-war Democrat, said the requested funding would ""prolong our occupation of Iraq through at least the end of 2011,"" when U.S. troops are scheduled to leave the country, ""and it will deepen and expand our military presence in Afghanistan indefinitely."" ""Instead of attempting to find military solutions to the problems we face in Iraq and Afghanistan, President Obama must fundamentally change the mission in both countries to focus on promoting reconciliation, economic development, humanitarian aid, and regional diplomatic efforts."" Last month, Obama announced the United States plans to withdraw most of its troops from Iraq by the end of August 2010. A residual force of between 35,000 to 50,000 troops will remain until December 31, 2011. There are 142,000 American troops in Iraq now. Obama has ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops to fight the Taliban in the south and east and 4,000 more to train Afghan troops.","NEW: About $9.8 billion would pay for body armor and protective vehicles .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The father of actress Lindsay Lohan was arrested in connection with a domestic dispute, authorities said Tuesday. Michael Lohan, 50, was arrested late Monday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department's West Hollywood Station said in a statement. Deputies arrested him on suspicion of inflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant, false imprisonment and preventing the report of victimization, the statement said. All are felony charges. Bail was set at $200,000, the statement said, but authorities said Tuesday afternoon Lohan had not been booked. He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after he complained of ""a medical condition not related to the incident"" following his arrest. He will remain at the hospital on observation for at least 24 hours before he is booked at the West Hollywood Station, police said. The sheriff's department did not identify the alleged victim.  But Kate Major, Lohan's former fiancee, told CNN she was the victim. ""I can confirm but barely type,"" Major wrote in an e-mail. ""No other comment."" The alleged victim suffered minor injuries but refused medical treatment, the sheriff's department said. Lohan was arrested near West Hollywood Station following the incident when deputies saw him walking on Santa Monica Boulevard, the statement said. The relationship between Michael Lohan and his 24-year-old daughter has been publicly strained for years, although the two did undergo family counseling together during her recent treatment at the Betty Ford Center. Lindsay Lohan must decide by Wednesday if she will accept a plea deal that would send her to jail or move closer to a trial on a felony grand theft charge. She is accused of walking out without paying for a $2,500 necklace from Kamofie and Co., a jewelry store in Venice, California, on January 22. If Lindsay Lohan decides to go to trial, a preliminary hearing will be held April 22. The judge at that time would also consider the matter of her probation violation; she faces possible jail time for violating her probation for a drunk-driving arrest because of the theft charge. CNN's Brittany Kaplan, Carey Bodenheimer and Alan Duke contributed to this report.","NEW: Michael Lohan will remain in the hospital for at least 24 hours .

"(CNN) -- An Australian high court ruled Friday that a quadriplegic man has the right to refuse food and water and can be allowed to die, a rare legal finding that some see as a major victory for right-to-die campaigners. An Australian high court ruled Friday that Christian Rossiter has the right to refuse food and water. The ruling means that the nursing facility in which Christian Rossiter has lived since November 2008 cannot be held criminally liable for allowing the patient to die, the Supreme Court of Western Australia said. ""I'm happy that I won my right to die,"" Rossiter, 49, said afterward. But he added that he will further consult with a doctor because he may change his mind. A leading Australian right-to-die advocate called the ruling a significant victory. ""I don't know that many people will want to die this way. But for people who do, it's a very important decision,"" said Dr. Philip Nitschke, founder and director of Exit International, a leading global voluntary euthanasia and end-of-life advocacy group. Nitschke noted that Rossiter's case is significant because his mind is fully functional. ""This is the first time that it's come up with a person that's rational and lucid,"" Nitschke told CNN. ""This is unusual. It's very rare."" Chief Justice Wayne Martin noted that distinction in his order, saying, ""Mr. Rossiter is not a child, nor is he terminally ill, nor dying. He is not in a vegetative state, nor does he lack the capacity to communicate his wishes. There is therefore no question of other persons making decisions on his behalf. ""Rather, this is a case in which a person with full mental capacity and the ability to communicate his wishes has indicated that he wishes to direct those who have assumed responsibility for his care to discontinue the provision of treatment which maintains his existence."" Some family and right-to-life groups opposed Rossiter's request. ""Really, what we should be doing is looking after each other rather than facilitating an escape,"" John Barich of the Australian Family Association said in a TV interview. Peter O'Meara, president of Western Australia's Right to Life Association, said, ""The law which is being applied can be a dangerous precedent."" Rossiter has suffered a series of injuries since 1988 that have left him with limited foot movement and the ability to wriggle only one finger. He is fed through a stomach tube. He relies on staff at the Brightwater Care Group nursing facility in the city of Perth for such routine care as regular turning, cleaning, assistance with bowel movements, physical and occupational therapy and speech pathology. Australian law gives patients the right to refuse life-saving treatment, but helping someone commit suicide is a crime that can carry a life prison sentence. The Brightwater nursing facility sought the ruling to make sure it would not be held liable if it complied with Rossiter's request to stop all nutrition and hydration, except to be given enough liquid to make it possible to take pain medication. Rossiter attended the hearing in a wheelchair, breathing through a tracheotomy tube in his throat. He told the judge he wants to die. It's a point he has been making publicly. ""I can't move,"" Rossiter said in a televised interview this week. ""I can't even wipe the tears from my eyes. And I'd like to die. I'm imprisoned in my own body. I have no fear of death. Just pain."" Rossiter pointed out in a recent interview with the PerthNow news outlet that he once led an active life. ""This is living hell,"" he is quoted as saying. ""I used to be a cyclist, I used to be a keen walker. I bushwalked around the world. ... I've rock climbed in Yosemite Valley in California up very steep cliffs. I've got a degree in economics and now I can't even read a newspaper, I can't turn the pages."" Rossiter joined the Exit International right-to-death organization about three months ago, said Nitschke, who talked with him before the hearing. Nitschke said Rossiter appeared ""very happy"" afterward. A Brightwater executive said the company appreciates that the court's ruling has relieved the nursing facility of any liability. ""The whole organization has been most concerned for Mr. Rossiter but also concerned for our own legal standing and this has clarified things greatly,"" said Penny Flett, the company's chief executive. While hailing the victory, Nitschke decried the fact that Rossiter will have to undergo a slow and painful death through starvation, rather than having a quicker and painless way to end his life. Because he cannot use his hands, Rossiter must rely on others to withhold treatment rather than being able to take his own life. Switzerland has an assisted suicide law, and Rossiter has considered going there. ""It's a bit sad that the best that Australia can come up with,"" Nitschke said, ""is that we can let a person like that starve to death.""","Series of accidents in 1988 left Christian Rossiter unable to live normally .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pregnant women in Peru are dying at scandalous rates, according to the author of an Amnesty International report into maternal mortality in the South American country. Vertical births where women are kneeling or crouching and holding on to a rope are common in Peru. The report, ""Fatal Flaws: Barriers to Maternal Health in Peru"" found that hundreds of poor, rural and indigenous pregnant women are dying because they are being denied the same health services as other women in the country. It also concluded that the government's response to tackling the problem was inadequate. Peruvian government figures state 185 in every 100,000 women die in child birth, but the United Nations says the number is much higher at 240, which makes it one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the Americas. In wealthy developed nations, only nine women die for every 100,000 births. The five main causes of pregnancy-related deaths in Peru are hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, infection, complications following abortion and obstructed birth, according to Peru's Ministry of Health figures. Amnesty's Peru researcher Nuria Garcia said in a statement: ""The rates of maternal mortality in Peru are scandalous. The fact that so many women are dying from preventable causes is a human rights violation. ""The Peruvian state is simply ignoring its obligation to provide adequate maternal healthcare to all women, regardless of who they are and where they live."" Garcia added: ""Health services for pregnant women in Peru are like a lottery: if you are poor and indigenous, the chances are you will always lose."" Amnesty's report highlighted the case of Criselda, a  22-year-old indigenous woman from the country's Huancavelica Department, one of the poorest regions of the country. While seven months pregnant, she fell and hurt herself, and after feeling pains, she went to the health post for a check-up. The doctor said she was fine and sent her away but she miscarried two days later, according to the report. The report found that so many women are dying because they face a number of barriers, including a lack of health staff who speak indigenous languages like Quechua -- a native Andean language spoken by some five million people in Peru. However, the vast majority of Peruvian doctors only speak Spanish, as they rarely come from areas or communities where indigenous languages are spoken. Criselda told researchers she believes the doctor may not have picked up her symptoms accurately because she could not understand her, and interpreters were not available. Transport problems are also a contributing factor to the high mortality rate among Peruvian indigenous women, as most of them usually have to travel long distances to a health center to get attention, the report found. Criselda's husband Fortunato said in the report: ""There is no ambulance when there is an emergency. To go from here it takes us two or three days and sometimes they die right here because there is no vehicle or ambulance."" According to the report, 27 percent of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes occurred during pregnancy; 26 percent occurred during the birth itself; and 46 percent during the first six weeks after giving birth. Amnesty has urged the Peruvian government to allocate resources to maternal mortality and reproductive health, prioritizing the regions with the highest mortality ratios. The organization also recommends an increase in training, particularly in indigenous languages.","New Amnesty report says Peru's poor pregnant women dying of neglect .

"(CNN) -- It's well known that the secret to Apple's meteoric success in the world of consumer technology was the vision, leadership and creativity of Steve Jobs, the company's celebrity founder. ""Steve built a company and culture that is unlike any other in the world and we are going to stay true to that -- it is in our DNA,"" Tim Cook, Jobs' successor, wrote in a staff memo after Jobs resigned from his post as Apple's CEO in August. What's less talked about is what drove Jobs, who died Wednesday at 56. As with anyone, Jobs' values were shaped by his upbringing and life experiences. He was born in 1955 in San Francisco and grew up amid the rise of hippie counterculture. Bob Dylan and the Beatles were his two favorite musical acts, and he shared their political leanings, antiestablishment views and, reportedly, youthful experimentation with psychedelic drug usage. The name of Jobs' company is said to be inspired by the Beatles' Apple Corps, which repeatedly sued the electronics maker for trademark infringement until signing an exclusive digital distribution deal with iTunes. Like the Beatles, Jobs took a spiritual retreat to India and regularly walked around his neighborhood and the office barefoot. Traversing India sparked Jobs' conversion to Buddhism. Kobun Chino, a monk, presided over his wedding to Laurene Powell, a Stanford University MBA. 'Life is an intelligent thing' Rebirth is a precept of Buddhism, and Apple experienced rebirth of sorts when Jobs returned, after he was fired, to remake a company that had fallen the verge of bankruptcy. ""I believe life is an intelligent thing, that things aren't random,"" Jobs said in a 1997 interview with Time, providing a glimpse into his complicated belief system that extends well beyond the Buddhist teachings. Karma is another principle of the religion, but it didn't appear to be a system Jobs lived by. If he feared karma coming back to bite him, the sentiment wasn't evident in his public statements about competitors and former colleagues, calling them ""bozos"" lacking taste. Those who worked for Jobs described him as a tyrant they feared meeting in an elevator. ""You'd be surprised how hard people work around here,"" Jobs said in a 2004 interview with Businessweek. ""They work nights and weekends, sometimes not seeing their families for a while. Sometimes people work through Christmas to make sure the tooling is just right at some factory in some corner of the world so our product comes out the best it can be."" Some engineers who worked tirelessly on the original Mac emerged from the project estranged from their spouses and children. Jobs' relentless work ethic may have been shaped by some of his dysfunctional family affairs as well. 'I've done things I'm not proud of' Jobs was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs, who promised his birth mother, Joanne Simpson (whom Jobs later tracked down with the help of a private investigator), that they would send him to a university. He dropped out of Reed College after one semester, and he reportedly never was willing to talk to his birth father. Jobs had a daughter, Lisa, out of wedlock with Chrisann Brennan. He denied paternity for many years, swearing in a court document that he was sterile. Later, he had three more kids with Laurene Powell. ""I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of, such as getting my girlfriend pregnant when I was 23 and the way I handled that,"" Jobs said in a statement in 2011 to promote his authorized biography. That youthful indiscretion came before Jobs turned to Buddhism and karma. 'The core values are the same' The Buddhist scriptures, according to tradition, were transmitted in secret, as were many of Apple's business dealings and Jobs' personal struggles. Like the paranoid secrecy that surrounded product development at Apple, Jobs spurned most reporters' interview requests, misled them in statements he did give, refused to disclose details of his cancer to investors until undergoing an operation and became shrouded in a scandal involving backdating stock options. By all accounts, he played by his own rules. Those who disclosed his secrets or whispered about his company were punished or threatened. Apple sued, and eventually settled with, the anonymous young blogger behind Think Secret, which accurately reported on Apple rumors in the early 2000s. And then there's the story of a lost iPhone 4 prototype, which was purchased and publicized by the blog Gizmodo. ""When this whole thing with Gizmodo happened, I got a lot of advice from people that said, 'You've got to just let it slide,' "" Jobs said onstage at a technology convention in 2010. ""I thought deeply about this, and I ended up concluding that the worst thing that could possibly happen as we get big and we get a little more influence in the world is if we change our core values and start letting it slide. I can't do that. I'd rather quit."" That stance was repeated this year, with Jobs still as CEO though on medical leave, when another employee left a prototype iPhone 5 in a bar. Apple enlisted the help of San Francisco police to investigate. ""We have the same values now as we had then,"" Jobs said at the AllThingsD conference. ""We're a little more experienced, certainly beat-up, but the core values are the same."" 'We're here to put a dent in the universe' Perhaps the most salient of those values is, simply, to make an outsize impact on society. Or, as Jobs put it, ""We're here to put a dent in the universe."" However, Apple and Jobs didn't make much of a dent with philanthropy. ""We do things where we feel we can make a significant contribution,"" Jobs told Businessweek in 2004. ""And our primary goal here is ... not to be the biggest or the richest."" To achieve that goal, Jobs was an obsessive micromanager. Part of the reason Jobs' DNA is so ingrained in Apple is because he forced his hand onto so many parts of it. He personally fielded some customer-service requests sent to him via e-mail; he was active in product design, co-authoring more than 300 patents; and he had a hand in the marketing efforts, including the famous Think Different and Mac vs. PC campaigns. ""What is Apple, after all?"" Jobs mused to Time. ""Apple is about people who think 'outside the box,' people who want to use computers to help them change the world, to help them create things that make a difference, and not just to get a job done."" 'Focus and simplicity' Jobs famously lured John Sculley, the PepsiCo president, to run Apple by saying: ""Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?"" (They had a permanent falling out when Jobs was booted from Apple.) ""What makes Steve's methodology different from everyone else's is that he always believed the most important decisions you make are not the things you do, but the things you decide not to do,"" Sculley said in a 2010 interview with Businessweek. ""He's a minimalist. I remember going into Steve's house, and he had almost no furniture in it. He just had a picture of Einstein, whom he admired greatly, and he had a Tiffany lamp and a chair and a bed. He just didn't believe in having lots of things around, but he was incredibly careful in what he selected."" Restraint, at least in gadget design and interior decorating, was a primary principle for Jobs. Shortly after his return to Apple, he shuttered several divisions and turned his attention to a few key initiatives. Even today, Apple's product lines and revenue are zeroed in on just a few industries in which the company can dominate. ""That's been one of my mantras: focus and simplicity,"" Jobs told Businessweek in 1998. ""Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."" He elaborated in the interview with the publication six years later: ""It comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much. We're always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it's only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important."" 'Stay hungry. Stay foolish.' Apple's management team members have each adopted parts of this code. Jonathan Ive, the industrial-design executive, echoes Jobs' simplicity ethic. Scott Forstall, the mobile software lead, has apparently inherited some of Jobs' enthusiasm and showmanship. And Cook, the former operations chief and, by some accounts, current workaholic micromanager, runs the company like he manages his private life: shrouded in secrecy. However, Cook comes out of his shell in order to impart the ethical standards onto new recruits. He, along with other execs, teaches at Apple University. Apple University ensures that employees are thoroughly educated on the company's principles and that Jobs' ideals live on. Jobs believed people never stop learning and should voraciously open their minds to new ideas. Put another way, like in his closing statement to Stanford's graduating class in 2005, ""Stay hungry. Stay foolish.""","Steve Jobs' values were shaped by his upbringing and life experiences .

"(CNN) -- Four men accused of involvement in a foiled terrorist plot against Western targets went on trial Wednesday in Germany. Fritz Gelowicz appears in court on April 22 in Dusseldorf, northern Germany. Three of the men -- two Germans and a Turk -- were arrested in September 2007. Authorities said they had begun mixing a huge amount of explosive material that could have resulted in a strong blast, bigger than the attacks in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005. The three -- Fritz Gelowicz, Martin Schneider, and Adem Yilmaz -- are charged with membership in foreign and domestic terrorist groups, preparation of explosives, plotting to murder, and plotting to commit a crime using explosives, the court said. Schneider is also accused of attempted murder, the court said. The fourth person, identified in German media reports as Attila Selek, is a German citizen of Turkish descent. The German magazine Der Spiegel said prosecutors are still searching for a fifth man they believe played a central role in the alleged plot. The trial is taking place at the Higher Regional Court in the northern city of Dusseldorf. When Gelowicz, Schneider and Yilmaz were arrested, they were found with sophisticated and difficult-to-obtain detonators, authorities with knowledge of the arrests have said. U.S. interests in Germany were among the targets of the plot, Michael Chertoff, who was the U.S. homeland security secretary, said at the time. Gelowicz and Schneider are Germans who converted to Islam. Gelowicz was a leading member of a radical Islamist center in Ulm in southern Germany and was well known to German authorities, officials said. The trial could last up to two years, Der Spiegel reported. The trial's paperwork reportedly fills some 530 folders and the prosecution plans to call 219 witnesses, the magazine said. A little-known Uzbek militant group, the Islamic Jihad Union, claimed responsibility for the plot days after the arrests. It said the intention was to target both U.S. and Uzbek targets, said German Interior Ministry spokesman Christian Sachs. German authorities had said the three men trained at the group's camps in northern Pakistan. The group said it wanted to target the United States' Ramstein Air Base and other U.S. and Uzbek military and diplomatic installations in Germany, Sachs said. Another of the group's goals, he said, was to force Germany to stop using an air base in Uzbekistan as a stopover point for moving equipment and personnel into and out of northern Afghanistan. The group is believed to have ties to al Qaeda. The Islamic Jihad Union was unknown until April 2004, when it conducted a series of suicide bombings in Uzbekistan, killing 47 people, according to the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, a non-profit organization funded by the Department of Homeland Security.","Authorities: Men had been preparing a huge amount of explosive material .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- A 69-year-old who was previously convicted of torching a palace has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed Namdaemun, South Korea's oldest wooden structure and a national treasure, authorities said on Tuesday. People on Monday look at the debris of the Namdaemun gate in central Seoul after the fire. Similarities between the Sunday night fire and the 2006 blaze led to the investigation of a man identified only as Mr. Chae, said Kim Young-Su, chief of police of the Namdaemun police station. Chae had served time in prison for the palace fire. Police searched the home of Chae's ex-wife and found a can of paint thinner and a pair of leather gloves they believe were used in the fire, Kim said. Chae confessed to starting the fire, saying he was upset by a land grievance that led him to start the 2006 fire and by the sentence he was handed in that case, Kim said. Chae was free on a suspended sentence, Kim added. Chae said he chose Namdaemun because it was easily accessible by public transportation and yet situated in a lightly populated area where the fire was unlikely to hurt people, according to police. The fire burned for hours, and more than a hundred firefighters tried to save it.  Watch the reaction to the Namdaemun's destruction » .

"Montgomery, Alabama (CNN) -- Gabriela Vazquez maneuvers through piles of clothes and toys while trying to control her two small children. ""They never stop,"" she says, while pulling a pair of pants from an almost-empty drawer and deciding whether to toss the pants to the ""keep"" or ""leave"" pile. The decision is not an easy one. Vazquez is attempting to pack five years of her life in the United States into only a handful of bags. ""I crossed over into the U.S. with nothing but my clothes, so I'm taking nothing, only my clothes and my kids,"" she says. Vazquez began packing moments after a federal judge in Birmingham, Alabama, last week allowed most of the state's controversial law, known as HB56, against illegal immigration to go into effect. Judge refuses to block law during appeal . The law allows police officers to check the legal status of people when suspicions exists, detain them and turn them over to federal authorities. It is described by both its supporters and its opponents as the strictest state immigration law in the nation. Law's enactment spooks immigrants . ""We expected the judge to rule like the other judges who blocked the laws in Arizona and Georgia,"" Vazquez says, referring to similar anti-illegal immigration laws approved in those states, with federal judges subsequently blocking the more severe parts of those bills. ""Now, they can take me away from my children anytime,"" Vazquez says. Her journey began five years ago when she and her husband left the Mexican state of MIchoacan and headed north in search of jobs. ""In Mexico, it is hard to find a job. I'm 35 years old, and the ads seeking help say they want people between the ages of 18 and 35,"" Vazquez says. ""It wasn't easy coming over. We left our parents, our siblings, our family, and they didn't know what was going to happen to us."" The couple entered the United States illegally and headed for Montgomery, where they had relatives. They first rented a room in a mobile home with other families until they found jobs. Vazquez's husband, Marco, became a carpet installer while she jumped from job to job in restaurants, hotels and grocery stores. Deportations will set record in 2011, Napolitano says . They managed to save enough to move into their own place. Along the way, she gave birth to a boy, now 4 years old, and a girl, now 2. ""I was not planning on having kids, but here they are,"" Vazquez says with a smile. A year ago they bought a mobile home that they renovated themselves. Vazquez proudly shows pictures of the transformation of the dwelling, and points out the kitchen cabinets she sanded and repainted. She also brags about her husband's work replacing the floor and walls, and the brand-new electric range the couple bought after the old gas one that came with the mobile home exploded during the renovation. ""There was a small leak and the thing just blew up,"" she says. The final product is a two-bedroom house fully furnished for a family of four. A large wrap-around sofa fills the living room in front of an old model big-screen TV set. A desktop computer sits on a breakfast bar that divides the living room from the kitchen, where a glass table for six can be found. All those belongings will be left behind unless they find a buyer soon. Vazquez apologizes for the mess she says is caused by her efforts to pack as soon as possible. The freshly painted walls have few pictures on them but the nails where many portraits hung a few days ago are still visible. When her husband arrives from work, the two kids are happy to see their father, especially the little girl, who doesn't want to leave her mother's side. Marco Vazquez is a reluctant participant in his wife's plan, which calls for her to return to Mexico with the kids while he stays behind to try to sell their belongings before he joins them. He would prefer to have his family wait so they can all leave at the same time. ""I ask her to stay just long enough so we can save the money to take the truck back to Mexico, but she has made up her mind,"" he says. Gabriela Vazquez hangs up the phone. She has been talking with her mother in Michoacan, who is already planning for her return. In a matter of minutes she warms corn tortillas on the stove and makes her husband some tacos filled with cochinita pibil -- shredded pork in a red chili sauce typical of southern Mexico. The little boy comes asking if they can watch a movie. He wants to see ""Finding Nemo,"" but his mother convinces him to watch something else. ""Nemo"" is already packed away, but she doesn't want to tell him that. ""It is hard,"" she says. ""I've been crying all weekend long and he cried when he saw me. He asks, 'Why do we have to go, why am I not going to school anymore?'"" She decided to pull her son out of pre-kindergarten the same day HB56 went onto effect. Her fear was that she would be arrested while he was in school and authorities would turn him over to child-support services.

Marco agrees and turns his attention back to the kids. His wife comes out with two bags full of clothes and tosses them in the back of the pickup truck, telling her husband to give them away. He takes a look and sees clothes the kids wore just a few days ago. He also finds a bag full of toys and a couple of strollers. ""Those were expensive,"" he says.

"ROME, Italy (CNN)  -- The Italian media call her ""Foxy Knoxy,"" portray her as a ""devil with an angel's face,"" and there are 11 Facebook pages dedicated to her, all in Italian. Both Raffaele Sollecito (left) and Amanda Knox deny charges of murder and sexual assault. Amanda Knox, 21, is an American college student from Seattle, Washington, who is on trial for murder in Perugia, Italy. The case has given Knox almost pop star status there. She was voted the top woman in an online ""person of the year"" poll by an Italian TV channel in December, beating out Carla Bruni, the Italian-born French first lady. Seven of the 11 Facebook pages champion her innocence; four seem convinced that Knox is pure evil. A sampling of comments: ""No to Amanda. No to her superstardom"" ... ""She's a sociopath"" ...""Everyone is not sure if she is guilty or not and that she will lead us to a new existential awareness. Please shout with me your anger. ... Let's say no. Let's say Knox."" Knox and former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 24, are charged with murdering and sexually assaulting one of Knox's roommates, British exchange student Meredith Kercher, on November 1, 2007. They insist they are innocent and are disputing the allegations. Knox and Sollecito are due back in court today. The last time Knox appeared before the panel of eight judges, she wore a T-shirt quoting The Beatles: ""All you need is love."" Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini alleges that Kercher, 21, was killed because she refused to participate in a drug-fueled sex game played by Knox, Sollecito, and a third man, Ivory Coast native Rudy Hermann Guede. In court papers, prosecutors stated that Sollecito held Kercher by her wrists while Knox poked at her with a knife and Guede sexually assaulted her. The case is being tried in Perugia, a university town about 115 miles north of Rome that is better known for its chocolate than for its scandalous murder trials. According to the prosecutor's office, Kercher had been in Italy for two months as part of a year-long course with Leeds University, where she was working toward a degree in European Studies. She shared a house with Knox, a University of Washington student in the same exchange program, and two Italian housemates. The crime scene, which has become a tourist attraction, has been broken into twice, police say. Knox and Sollecito were arrested November 6, 2007, and were kept in prison while an investigation continued. The judge overseeing the investigation found both were capable of committing the crime again, fleeing the country or tampering with the evidence. Police sought charges in July 2008, and they were ordered to trial in October. The trial began January 16 and has been held mostly on weekends. Italian newspapers assigned their top crime reporters, and the case has received unprecedented international coverage. Knox has appeared on the cover of People magazine, which shares a corporate parent with CNN. A random sampling of women on the streets of Rome showed that all of them had heard of the case and most believed Knox and Sollecito were at the very least implicated in the slaying. The superheated publicity surrounding the case helped make Knox a household name in Italy. She is usually portrayed as a femme fatale. Consider these headlines: . • ""Sex, lies and stabbings""  • ""Lovers without any inhibitions""  • ""And in prison, she even tries to sun tan"" Italian journalists also have plastered their newspapers with photos they found of Knox on the Internet, especially images that showed her as a ""wild girl."" They pounced on the ""Foxy Knoxy"" nickname they found on her MySpace page, even though her parents later explained the high school moniker came from the way Knox played soccer, quick like a fox. Although Italian law limits the publication of court and police records, the media ban is less strict than in many European countries. While it is not exactly legal to publish police investigative reports, no journalist has gone to jail in Italy for doing it. Among the items leaked: Knox's diary, various police interrogations, photos of Kercher's body, video of Kercher's body (which wound up on YouTube but has been pulled), and video of the Italian forensic police carrying out their investigation. Eventually, even the leaks made headlines, leading to more speculation. Knox can do no right in the Italian media. If she appears reserved and timid in court, she is portrayed as someone with plenty to hide. If she smiles or laughs in court, she's called disrespectful. As far as the Italian media is concerned, Knox is the mastermind who manipulated those around her and seduced her Italian boyfriend and led him astray. While Knox and Sollecito's preliminary hearings were being held in October, Guede was convicted of murder after a fast-track trial. His lawyers had hoped that the speedy resolution of the case would give him a break at sentencing. He got 30 years in prison. According to testimony at Guede's trial, his fingerprints were found in the house, and his DNA was linked to Kercher's body. He has never denied being in the house the night of the slaying but insists he didn't kill her. He says he had an ""appointment"" with her that night and was in the bathroom when she was killed. Sollecito and Knox say they weren't at the house the night of the slaying. They say they both were at Sollecito's house. But the alibi has been contradicted by witnesses at the trial. Eighty-six media outlets sent 140 journalists to cover the opening of the trial in January, but publicity has waned since then. The Italian 24-hour news channel TG24 no longer breaks into its programming with multiple updates. Knox, for now, has been relegated to the pages preceding the sports or weather report. But Italians love their murder cases, and attention has shifted to other crime news. A mother is accused of killing her toddler son, a husband and wife are accused of multiple killings. Their courtrooms are now filled with spectators who wait in line an hour or more. The Perugia courtroom still is packed, but the long line is gone. That is likely to change, however, as testimony shifts to the defense case.","Murder trial makes American student notorious in Italy .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Three security contractors, two of them American veterans and one from Fiji, have been freed in Iraq almost three weeks after they were detained by the Iraqi Army, U.S. Rep. Peter King said Wednesday. The men, who were working for a security firm, were arrested by Iraqi Army forces in Mahmudiyah on December 9 but were not charged with any offense, said King, a New York Republican. ""I am pleased that these three men have been released after having been detained,"" King said. ""With the unfortunate and clearly deteriorating security situation in Iraq and with al Qaeda in Iraq still very active, these men were in increasing danger with each passing day."" King said he got involved after being contacted by the wife of one of the men, Army veteran Alex Antiohos of Long Island, New York. The other two contractors are Jonas March of Savannah, Georgia, and Kevin Fisher of Fiji, he said. The congressman asked the U.S. State Department for help and wrote to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to appeal for their release, he said in a statement. King said the three men were detained because the Iraqi military ""did not like the 'mission request authorization' paperwork that had been issued by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior."" The United States is still negotiating with the Iraqi government about whether U.S. contractors will be granted any diplomatic protections under Iraqi law. The final U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq 10 days ago, after a war that lasted almost nine years. CNN's Adam Levine contributed to this report.","NEW: Rep.

"(CNN) -- This week's shooting death and subsequent dragging of a black man in South Carolina are being investigated as a possible hate crime, the Newberry County Sheriff's Office said Friday. Sheriff Lee Foster said the body of 30-year-old Anthony Hill was found early Wednesday on a road near an elementary school in the town of Pomaria, 35 miles west-northwest of Columbia. Hill had a single gun shot wound to the head, his body was nearly nude and a rope was around his neck and upper torso, Foster said. Foster said Hill's body -- which carried no identification -- was found around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday by a motorist, who called 911. Officers followed a trail of blood and human tissue nine miles to the trailer park where Hill's co-worker Gregory Collins lives, surrounded his trailer for nearly four hours and finally resorted to tear gas, Foster said. ""He came outside and gave himself up,"" Foster added. Collins, 19, who is white, is charged with murder. Both men worked in Newberry at the Louis Rich turkey processing plant, said Foster. ""They did know each other; they worked in the same industry, on the same shift but different divisions,"" said Foster. ""Neighbors told us the two spent most of the day together Tuesday. They were seen on a porch drinking together."" Hill, an Army veteran who lived in the neighboring county of Fairfield, was estranged from his wife and had two children, Foster said. Investigators have not concluded that the killing is a hate crime, but are looking at it as one, according to Foster. ""We called the FBI out of an abundance of caution,"" he said. ""We have no motive whatsoever as to why these two gentlemen would have been together, then one shoots the other in the head and drags him down the road. It's a horrific act of violence."" Collins, who is being held in the Newberry County Detention Center, has been assigned a public defender. Funeral arrangements are pending.","Both men worked in a turkey processing plant .

"SILVER SPRING, Maryland (CNN) -- As Marilyn Seitz helps customers find just the right size, she wonders how much longer before she's forced to close her doors. Maryland thrift store manager Marilyn Seitz says the new rules have the potential to put the store out of business. The Pennyworth Thrift Store in Silver Spring, Maryland, isn't suffering from the struggling economy. Secondhand stores across the country are more in demand than ever as many people are desperate to save money. Instead, Seitz is worried her business may become an unintended casualty of an attempt to protect children. After a wave of highly publicized tainted-toy recalls last year, Congress passed the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Then-President George Bush signed the bill in August, and new federal restrictions on lead and other harmful substances take effect Tuesday. The new rules ban lead content beyond minute levels of 600 parts per million in any product for children 12 and younger. The law not only makes it illegal to manufacture lead-laced products, but it also makes it illegal to sell them no matter when the products were made -- and stores found breaking the law could face fines of up to $100,000 per violation. ""It would just be virtually impossible for me to feel safe that my toys meet the guidelines,"" Seitz said. ""I feel confident that these are safe toys, but anything carries a risk. Since I can be held criminally and financially responsible if I sell a toy that is on the recall list or a toy that tests for lead, I just have to wipe out all my toys.""  Watch why thrift stores fear new rules will force them out of business » . Now Seitz is going to throw away or give away her entire inventory of children's items, fearing this latest attempt at protecting kids will force the Pennyworth Thrift Store and thousands of others out of business. The ban also applies to children's clothes and books. The National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops say tens of thousands of secondhand stores across the country are at risk. Adele Meyer, the association's executive director, said some owners are preparing to shutter their stores out of fear. ""This has gotten so serious, and it is so frightening, because we serve consumers that sometimes have no other way to clothe their children,"" Meyer said. ""It was a law that was well-intentioned that has unintended consequences, that is hurting the manufacturing industry, the retailers, and the secondary market."" The Consumer Product Safety Commission, the government agency tasked with implementing the sweeping law, seems to agree. CPSC spokesman Joe Martyak acknowledges the new rules are complex and confusing. ""With the economy the way it is right now, we all are concerned about safety, but we don't want to unnecessarily be impacting jobs and businesses,"" Martyak said. He said the CPSC is trying to set guidelines to help manufacturers, retailers and thrift stores better understand what is safe and what is not. ""What we've been trying to do is to point out categories that we feel and our scientists feel that are safe, that really are almost practically lead-free,"" Martyak said. ""We have no reason to believe that there's a risk involved with them."" Those categories include products made of certain natural materials, such as wood, cotton or wool; ordinary children's books printed after 1985; dyed or undyed textiles, not including leather, vinyl or PVC; and non-metallic thread and trim used in children's apparel and other fabric products, such as baby blankets. However, Martyak says even these guidelines cause confusion. ""If you have a pair of pants that has two buttons, a zipper, and an applique on it, we can say our understanding is the fabric itself doesn't have lead and you're OK,"" he said. ""But as far as those other pieces that are on the pants, that's where the problem is, because you'd have to have that tested or know some other way that it's not over the lead limit."" The CPSC is allowing manufacturers an extra year to comply with the product-testing requirements, but it can't offer a reprieve for selling restricted products under the new rules. Congress has the sole power to change the implementation timeline set in the law. Martyak said the agency has tried to win some ""breathing space"" from Congress ""to make whatever tweaks are necessary, keeping safety in mind ... but get to it in a little bit more reasonable, a sane way, because right now we're headed for a lot of chaos in the economy because of this, unfortunately."" That is what has Marilyn Seitz scratching her head. ""No one wants to do anything to hurt children,"" she said. ""But you've got to stop it at the level of entry. You can't stop it when it's all over like this.""","Thrift stores worry new lead rules will force them to toss kids' inventory, shut doors .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel early Sunday released the names of the first group of Palestinian prisoners to be freed in exchange for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, setting in motion a process that will allow the public to file objections to specific releases. The list features 477 names, including those of Ahlam Tamimi, serving life terms for being an accomplice in a suicide bombing at a Jerusalem restaurant, and Amneh Muna, who plotted the killing of a 16-year-old Israeli boy in 2001 and received a life sentence. Israel approved the deal Tuesday night, agreeing to release in two stages 1,027 Palestinians prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis. The first swap is expected to take place early this week. Twenty-seven of the prisoners are women. The second stage, which includes 550 prisoners, will occur later this year. A spokesperson for Israeli President Shimon Peres said Saturday that the pardoning process formally commenced after a Justice Ministry official submitted the requisite paperwork. Peres will allocate 48 hours to complete the procedure in order to allow public objections and petitions against the pardons. Read the list (PDF) The president is expected to voice his discomfort with the release of convicted murderers, but is unlikely to reject any of the pardon requests, spokeswoman Ayelet Frish told CNN. Any changes to the list negotiated with Hamas could potentially endanger the entire deal, she said. The most notable name not in the list is jailed Palestinian lawmaker Marwan Barghouti, who is serving five life sentences. He was convicted in an Israeli court on murder and other charges related to his role in planning attacks on Israelis during the second Intifada. Shalit has been a recurring topic in the country's national dialogue. Militants captured him in June 2006 after tunneling into the Jewish state and attacking an Israeli army outpost. Israel immediately launched a military incursion into Gaza to rescue Shalit, then 19, but failed to free him. Since then, he has been held incommunicado by Hamas, which controls Gaza. Shalit's family has continuously petitioned Israeli government officials to broker a deal that would secure his release. ""Everyone wants to see Gilad Shalit safe and well and back home but I think there is a real failure to understand the price that is being paid, and the price is phenomenal,"" said Arnold Roth, who lost his daughter Malki in the Jerusalem suicide bombing in 2001. ""We are releasing people who have dedicated their lives to killing Jews and Israelis."" Roth opposes the announced release of Tamimi, who was sentenced to multiple life sentences for her involvement in the August 2001 bombing of a Sbarro pizza restaurant in 2001, in which 16 people were killed. Israeli radio reported Saturday that 182 files for pardons were submitted to the president for prisoners convicted in Israeli criminal courts. Remaining pardon requests will be handled by the Israeli Defense Forces officials. On Friday, the terror victims association Almagor petitioned the Supreme Court to suspend the release until the deal is thoroughly examined. More petitions against the deal are expected to be submitted Sunday by families of victims directly affected by the prisoners on the list. The Ministry of Justice announced it will operate an information center ""where information regarding prisoners on the list can be obtained."" Of the male prisoners on the list, 275 will return to their homes in Gaza. Most of the rest will be sent to the West Bank or East Jerusalem. Five prisoners who are Israeli citizens can return to their homes, and 39 are to be sent abroad.","NEW: Israeli releases list of first group of prisoners proposed for exchange .

"(CNN) -- ""Batman: Arkham City"" takes everything that was great about the first Arkham title and makes it bigger, bolder and better. The Dark Knight goes up against his most murderous foes with new weapons and allies in a story that expands the Batman universe. Spinning off the ending of ""Batman: Arkham Asylum,"" Gotham City decides that the best way to house all of its criminals is to wall off a large section of the city and dump them all together. So now, Joker, Penguin, Two-Face and others are free to do whatever they want inside those walls. Out of sight, out of mind. The 18-month backstory of the game was presented in a limited series by DC Comics in the months leading up to the game's release. If you didn't read the series, there may be some confusion about what's going on when the gameplay begins. The city is beautifully rendered, with plenty of locations that are unique to Batman's enemies. Although the regular prisoners tend to repeat themselves, each villain looks and feels very unique and true to their comic book counterparts. It also helps that Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy reprise their voice roles as the Joker and Batman, respectively. Those trademark voices have become as necessary as the Joker's laugh or Batman's scowl. Combat is similar to ""Arkham Asylum,"" as rhythmic button pushing sends Batman from foe to foe in a fluid and almost dance-like movement with devastating effects. The more times you can string together attacks will open new power moves that can daze or level multiple opponents. Batman's utility belt is full with some of the same ""toys"" as before but with new abilities and functions. Batarangs, batclaws and explosive gels are back, with additional weapons like smoke pellets and a new Cryptographic Sequencer to help the Caped Crusader escape from trouble or solve puzzles. Tutorials and the Batcomputer will help you master the skills needed to succeed as well as help point you in the direction of the next objective. Arkham City is five times the size Arkham Asylum was, so it is easy to get lost or misplace a mission. Batman spends most of his time traveling this new territory by grapnel gun and gliding. There is an opportunity to get a grapnel boost, so use it and it will cut down the time it takes to get around. In all, there are more than 250 upgrades and collectibles that help increase Batman's skills, armor and weaponry. Take advantage of each when you can. All that real estate needs to be occupied, and developers filled it up with some of Batman's most famous and deadly foes. Each of them wants to rule over the prisoners in Arkham City but is willing to take their shots at the Dark Knight when they can. Mr. Freeze, the Riddler, Two-Face, Harley Quinn and, of course, the Joker are ready to battle Batman in their own ways. Each has a unique agenda, and part of the gameplay is figuring out what they are up to and how best to stop it. The main storyline is filled with intrigue and drama. Fighting skills alone will not win the day, and Batman is again equipped with a Detective mode that lets him spot clues normal eyes can't see. In ""Arkham Asylum,"" this mode could be turned on and pretty much left on at all times. In ""Arkham City,"" the mode stays on until Batman takes a hit. Players will not want to leave it on the entire time, because they'll miss other things that are needed to complete other missions. Twelve complete side missions, which could be regular missions in their own right, help deepen the game's experience and introduce even more villains and weapons to use. Players also are assisted by allies and other heroes as they make their way through the city. The Riddler once again plays a big part in hiding riddles and puzzles all over the City. This time, however, he's taken hostages and releasing clues to their whereabouts only when Batman solves a certain number of riddles. Be warned: There are 400 secrets to be discovered, so don't pass up an opportunity to find them when you can. Catwoman is a playable character in the game, with her own adventures and missions. There is some crossover between her and Batman during cut scenes, but fighting and puzzle-solving are all things she does on her own. She has some special abilities, like being able to climb on ceilings and use her whip and bolas to take down enemies. She also has more than 50 trophies and upgrades that can be collected by only her. The mastermind behind all the action? Well, you don't read comic books from the back to the front, do you? Suffice to say, the game story takes plenty of twists and turns, revealing more about the Dark Knight and his rogues. The action is well balanced between fighting objectives and detective work and has a nice flow and pace. It is a very deep game with a lengthy storyline, plenty of side missions and hundreds of collectibles. The playable Catwoman sections are a nice addition that weaves in and out of the main story but never feels out of place. Through it all, players will become enmeshed in the Batman universe and experience it all as if they were looking through the eye slits of the Dark Knight's cowl and into his mind. It is a wonderful mix of classic characters, enhanced combat and new highlights that makes ""Batman: Arkham City"" worthy to wear the Bat-logo. ""Batman: Arkham City"" will be available Tuesday in North America, Wednesday in Australia, October 21 in Europe and November 23 in Japan for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A PC version is expected to be released in November, and a Wii U version is planned for 2012. The game is rated T for Teen due to alcohol reference, blood, mild language, suggestive themes, use of tobacco and violence.

"(CNN) -- Japan have comfortably beaten Denmark 3-1 at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg to book their place in the last 16 of the World Cup. First half goals from Keisuke Honda and Yasuhito Endo gave the Danes a mountain to climb. They never looked like they would recover and a miserable night was completed when Shinji Okazaki added a third in the 87th minute, shortly after a Jon Dahl Tomasson 81st minute goal had given Denmark a glimmer of hope. The Danes were comprehensively outplayed by Japan who produced their most resolute and skilful display of the tournament so far. As runners up in Group E Japan will now face Paraguay in Pretoria on Tuesday for a place in quarter-finals. The three-time Asian Cup champions join Netherlands, who confirmed first place in the group by beating an already-eliminated Cameroon 2-1 in Cape Town. A first half strike from Robin van Persie and a second by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar seven minutes from time ensured Netherlands finished with a 100 percent record at the top of Group E setting up a second round clash with Italy's vanquishers Slovakia in Durban on Monday. Champions Italy crash out of World Cup . The win over Cameroon team in Cape Town completed a comfortable group stage for the Dutch, despite not playing their best football. They will be boosted though by the return of Arjen Robben who came on as a second half substitute. Japan 3-1 Denmark . Denmark, who needed to win the match to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages, started their match with Japan brightly. Skipper Jon Dahl Tomasson saw a chance go narrowly wide in the opening minutes. But two Japanese strikes within 13 minutes of each other stunned the Danes. Honda gave Japan the lead in the 17th minute with fine free kick which flew past keeper Thomas Sorensen who appeared to be deceived by the flight of the ball. Yasuhito Endo doubled Japan's lead in the 30th minute when he curled a beautifully executed free kick around the Danish wall and past the despairing dive of Sorenson. If the Danish keeper was possibly at fault for the first goal, there was nothing he could do with Endo's strike which found the bottom left corner of the net. The second half didn't get any better for the Danish keeper when he fumbled an innocuous looking free kick from Yasuhito Endo. His blushes were saved when the ball cannoned to safety off his right hand post. Jon Dahl Tomasson scored for Denmark in the 81st minute, turning in the rebound from his own penalty kick which had been awarded for a push on Daniel Agger. But it was too little too late for the 1992 European Champions. Moments later, Okazaki scored a third for Japan after Keisuke Honda unselfishly laid the ball on for him. It sealed a memorable win and qualification for the last 16 on foreign soil for the first time in their history. But man-of-the-match Honda believes Japan could go even further in the tournament. ""I expected to be really jubilant but I'm not as jubilant as I thought I would be because I don't think we are finished here. I believe we can go further in this competition,"" the CSKA Moscow star said, AFP reported. Netherlands 2-1 Cameroon . Robin Van Persie opened the scoring for Netherlands in the 36th minute. Playing a neat one-two with Rafael van der Vaart on the edge of Cameroon's penalty area, the Arsenal striker then fired a low shot under keeper Souleymanou to register his first goal of the tournament. Inter Milan's Samuel Eto'o leveled the scores in the 65th minute after Cameroon were awarded a penalty by the Chilean referee, Pablo Pozo when Rafael van der Vaart raised an arm to block Geremi's free-kick in the box. Eto'o stepped up to score his second goal of the tournament. The introduction of Arjen Robben -- his first appearance at the 2010 World Cup -- immediately created panic in the Cameroon defense. Cutting in from the right, Robben fired a shot from 20 yards which rebounded off the post. The ball fell kindly to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar who coolly slotted home the ball into an empty net and secure victory for Netherlands.","Japan produce stunning performance to beat Denmark 3-1 in Rustenburg .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Rio de Janeiro's special police forces declared Sunday that they were in full control of one of the city's biggest and most notorious shantytowns, Rocinha, after a predawn operation aimed at wresting control from drug traffickers. The operation, involving 3,000 police and security forces, had successfully occupied Rocinha and neighboring slums Vidigal and Chacara do Ceu, the Rio de Janeiro government said on its website. ""The next stage will be looking for the criminals that were able to get out of the places we are working,"" military police Col. Alberto Pinheiro Neto told reporters Sunday morning. About 100,000 people live in Rocinha. Some 200 navy commandos with armored personnel carriers and helicopters also participated in the operation. Roads were blocked at 2:30 a.m. and troops started moving in around 4 a.m., according to the local government. CNN affiliate Band News TV showed military assault vehicles rolling in and heavily armed police patrolling the streets. The massive operation is part of Rio's efforts to eliminate crime and arrest drug traffickers in one of the countryÂ¹s most violent cities ahead of the 2014 World Cup. Rio de Janeiro Gov. Sergio Cabral said the so-called ""Shock of Peace"" operation was a ""historic chapter."" ""We are rescuing communities that were abandoned for decades and dominated by parallel powers,"" he told reporters. ""These are people who need to be able to raise their children in peace."" Residents told Band News TV that they were happy that police had stepped up their presence. The operation will have an impact beyond Rocinha, which supplies 80% of the drugs in Rio de Janeiro, Congresswoman Marina Magessi told Band News TV. ""We are certain that from now until the end of the year, there will be a shortage of drugs present in Rio,"" said Magessi, a former police inspector responsible for catching some of Rio's top criminals. Police have already ""pacified"" dozens of favelas since they began operations in 2008, but it's an uphill battle. About one-fifth of RioÂ¹s residents live in the city's 1,000 shantytowns, many of them perched on steep hills overlooking beachside condominiums. Sunday's operation stands in stark contrast to the invasion of the Alemao favela last year when more than 30 people were killed in shootouts. Police arrested Rocinha's top suspected drug trafficker days before they moved in. They found Antonio Francisco Bomfim, known as Nem, in the trunk of a car. On Sunday, police reported capturing a handful of automatic guns and other weapons. They also found the steep and winding roads leading into Rocinha covered with oil, apparently an attempt to make it more difficult for police to enter. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: A former police inspector says the operation will cut down on Rio's drug supply .

"(CNN) -- Five people have been charged with attempted theft in Ohio after allegedly trying to steal the carcass of an escaped lion that was set free by its owner -- along with other exotic animals -- and ultimately killed by authorities. Authorities apprehended four adults and one juvenile October 19 as they attempted to sneak the lion carcass into their vehicle, Muskingum County Sheriff Matthew J. Lutz said. ""They got the cat into the trunk, and we stopped them,"" Lutz said. ""I'm not sure what they planned to do with it."" The five were charged Monday, he said. According to sheriff's department documents, deputies stopped a Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle and found the large dead cat inside. Authorites have not released the juvenile's name, but the men were identified as Richard Weidlich, Brian Matthews, Joseph Jakubisin and Cody Wilson, according to the criminal complaint. If convicted, they could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. The attorneys for the men could not be immediately reached for comment. Of the 56 animals released October 18, killed were two wolves, six black bears, two grizzly bears, nine male lions, eight lionesses, one baboon, three mountain lions and 18 Bengal tigers, Lutz said at the time of the incident. Only a grizzly bear, two monkeys and three leopards were taken alive. A monkey remained unaccounted for. Officials in Muskingum County closed schools as sheriff's deputies equipped with night vision equipment attempted to hunt down the animals in eastern Ohio after the suicide of the man at the farm where they lived.","Lion was among exotic animals set free by owner, killed by authorities .

"(CNN) -- Americans are spending less time stuck in traffic and wasting less gas, according to a new report. Americans spend a little less time in traffic, a study shows, but drivers on I-110 in Los Angeles might not notice. Rising joblessness and stinging gas prices have put the brakes on worsening trends in traffic congestion, according to a study issued Wednesday by the Texas Transportation Institute, the nation's largest university-based transportation research facility. ""It's temporary, but real,"" said institute spokesman Bernie Fette about the declines. ""As goes the American economy, so goes traffic. There's fewer people going to work."" The institute attributed the changes to the recession, but the U.S. economy did not begin to slow significantly until the end of 2007. The organization began tracking traffic trends in 1982, and by ""every measure, congestion has increased substantially"" in those 25 years, the latest Urban Mobility Report said. Not in 2007. Researchers surveyed 439 urban centers in the United States and found that travelers spent one hour less stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did in 2006 and wasted 1 gallon less of gasoline. Congestion delay per traveler in 1982 was 13.8 hours. In 2005, that number had almost tripled to 37.4 hours. But it was down to 36.1 hours in 2007, representing a ""rare break in near-constant growth,"" the report said. Because the changes were nominal, most people may not have noticed any change in their commutes. The average person still needs 25 percent more time to travel during rush hour than during other parts of the day, Fette said. ""Things were so congested and bad, it was kind of hard to notice,"" Fette said. Among the report's other findings: . • American travelers still wasted 4.2 billion hours stuck in rush-hour traffic jams. That amounts to nearly one full work (or vacation) week for every traveler. • The overall cost, based on wasted fuel and lost productivity, reached $87.3 billion in 2007, the report said. That's more than $750 per person. • The amount of wasted fuel, from sitting idle with the motor running, topped 2.8 billion gallons, or three weeks' worth of gas, for every traveler. Congestion has slowed but, said the report's authors, that means only that things are getting worse slower, ""hardly a positive goal statement."" The Urban Mobility Report database includes a few similar periods from regional recessions in the past -- northeastern states in the early 1980s, Texas in the mid-1980s, California in the early 1990s. In every case, when the economy rebounded, so did the congestion problem, the report said. That means congestion trends are likely to swing upward once the economy starts picking up. Americans might then have fatter pocketbooks, but they'll go back to staring through their windshields a bit longer.

"United Nations (CNN) -- Delegates from the United States and other nations walked out of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered a fiery speech that criticized Washington, capitalism and the world body itself. Though incendiary statements from Ahmadinejad are nothing new, tension in the hall grew as the Iranian leader recounted various conspiracy theories about the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. ""Some segments within the U.S. government orchestrated the attack,"" Ahmadinejad told the General Assembly. He followed with the claim that the attacks were aimed at reversing ""the declining American economy and its scripts on the Middle East in order to save the Zionist regime. The majority of the American people, as well as most nations and politicians around the world, agree with this view."" That appeared to be the last straw for many of the diplomats. Representatives from the United States, Britain, Sweden, Australia, Belgium, Uruguay and Spain walked out while Ahmadinejad asserted that U.S. government was involved in the attacks or allowed them to happen as an excuse to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq. President Barack Obama already had delivered his address to the General Assembly and had left the grounds before Ahmadinejad spoke. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president ""found the comments to be outrageous and offensive, given how close we are to ground zero,"" the New York site of the attacks. And Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the U.S. mission to the U.N., said in a statement, ""Rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the Iranian people, Mr. Ahmadinejad has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable."" A European Union diplomat said that all 27 member nations had agreed to walk out if Ahmadinejad made inflammatory statements during his address. The exits did not deter the Iranian leader from his line of attack, however. Ahmadinejad went on to compare the death toll in the September 11 attacks to the casualty count in the wars in Afghanistan in Iraq. ""It was said that some 3,000 people were killed on September 11th, for which we are all very saddened,"" he said. ""Yet, up until now in Afghanistan and Iraq, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, millions wounded and displaced, and the conflict is still going on and expanding."" Ahmadinejad also continued the attack on capitalism that he began during a Monday address at the Millennium Global Development Summit. He linked the U.S.-led conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan with wars for colonial expansion in Africa, Latin America and Asia. The Iranian president also touched on the recent controversy over a Florida pastor's plans to burn copies of the Quran, the Muslim holy book, by waving copies of a Bible and a Quran as he declared his respect and reverence for both. And he concluded his address with a defense of Iran's nuclear ambitions, discussing a recently submitted statement to the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Islamist parties made dramatic advances in Egypt's parliamentary elections during the first round of voting for lawmakers this week, a result reflecting a growing embrace of religious-oriented sentiment across turbulent North Africa. ""We accept the results of the elections in any case because it's the will of the people, and our rivals should embrace it too because this is the true democracy we fought for and we wish our liberal brothers better results in the next two rounds,"" Mahmoud Ghozlan, spokesman of the relatively moderate Muslim Brotherhood, whose Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) won 40% of the vote. Al Noor Salafi Movement, a hard-line Muslim group, had the second-highest total, 20%, in the first round of voting for the lower house of parliament, according to Yousri Abdel Kareem, head of the executive office of the Higher Judicial Election Council. In the first election after the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak, the tallies reflected similar results in Morocco and Tunisia. Moderate Islamists in those North African nations prevailed in recent elections amid the wave of political discontent across the Arabic-speaking world this year. Secularists weren't surprised at the result but they were stunned that some longtime secular groups performed poorly. ""The strong showing of the Islamists should serve to mobilize more support for secular candidate,"" said Mohamed Ghoneim, speaking for the liberal Egyptian Bloc that garnered 15% of the vote. ""We need to build on that and we are going for it."" Ghoneim said voters were turned off by some secular candidates because they come from Mubarak's old National Democratic Party. The Muslim Brotherhood is entrenched in mainstream Egyptian politics. Most are highly educated -- doctors, lawyers, engineers, professors and businessmen -- and come from solidly middle-class backgrounds. Al Noor Salafi is the first Salafist group to register as a political party in Egypt. Salafis are conservative, religious purists and have been accused of stoking sectarian strife against Egypt's Christian minority and of plotting to undermine the country's fledgling democracy. This week's voting in Egypt marked the initial part of a complex, multi-step process that will first pick members of the lower house of parliament. Voters had to cast three votes, two for independent candidates and one for a party or coalition. Four independent candidates won but runoff elections for those who didn't win clear majorities will be held Monday and Tuesday. One of the four is Amr Hamzawy, once a research director at theÂ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a spokesman of the ""Board of Wise Men,"" which worked to foster negotiations between the government and protesters. Presidential elections will be held by June, according to the military, which has rulied the country since Mubarak's fall. ""The success of Islamist parties will make it much more difficult, if not impossible, for the Egyptian military to prolong its political control and to recreate a political system along the lines of Hosni Mubarak, as it appeared intent on doing."" Marina Ottaway, a senior associate of Carnegie's Middle East program, said in an analysis on Friday. Voter turnout was initially reported by the country's election board at 62%, but the board said it would recalculate the figure after reporters raised questions about the number of registered voters used in the calculation, suggesting the true figure was lower. Abdel Moez Ibrahim, head of the judicial election committee said problems arose during the polling that will be addressed in the next round of voting. They include campaigning on the days of the elections, long lines and the late arrival of a limited number of ballots. Ibrahim said sending vehicles to pick up judges and handing out paper ballots the night before elections are among solutions to problems. Ibrahim said the process has been triumphant for Egyptian democracy. ""The winner of these elections is the Egyptian people,"" he said. As for the future, the Carnegie analysis says ""the response of the military and secular parties, and the political acumen of the FJP"" will determine whether the future government will be ""dominated by Islamists, including hard-line Salafis, or a less threatening alliance of the FJP and secular parties,"" Ottaway said.

"(CNN) -- Mississippi voters Tuesday rejected a controversial amendment that would have defined life as beginning at conception while Ohio voters repealed a law that limited the collective bargaining rights of public workers, CNN projects. The two ballot measures had national implications as Americans voted in an off-year election. The Mississippi amendment would have made it impossible to get an abortion in the state and hampered the ability to get the morning-after pill or birth control pills that destroy fertilized eggs. Disposing of unused fertilized eggs could also have become illegal, making in vitro fertilization treatments more difficult. National right to life groups opposed the measure and the Catholic Church in Mississippi called it extreme. The Ohio law limited the bargaining rights of police, teachers, firefighters and other public workers over salaries, workplace conditions and hours. It prohibited strikes and promotions based on seniority only, and required public workers to contribute at least 10% of their income toward their pensions and at least 15% to pay for their health care insurance. The Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill Republican Gov. John Kasich signed it into law in March but a successful petition drive kept it from being enacted and placed it on the November ballot. Kasich said Tuesday night that it was clear that the people had spoken. ""Part of leading is listening to and hearing what people have to say to you,"" he said. The vote was seen as a victory for unions and Democrats, but CNN projects that Democrats are taking a loss in Ohio in a measure that exempts Ohioans from compulsory participation in the mandatory health care coverage portion of President Barack Obama's health care reform law passed last year. Since the measure is a state one and the health law is a federal one, it is unclear what impact it might have and it is seen as largely a protest vote. In other elections around the country: . • CNN projects that Mississippi's governor's seat will stay in Republican hands as Republican Lt. Gov. Phil Bryant appeared to be on his way to victory over Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree, who would have been the state's first African-American governor. DuPree, who was elected the first black mayor of Hattiesburg in 2001, was expected to spark a stronger than usual turnout in the African-American community. Bryant will succeed Republican Gov. Haley Barbour, who was barred by term limits from running again after serving two terms. • In Arizona, the state senator who wrote the controversial immigration law lost to a charter school superintendent in a recall election widely seen as a referendum on tough measures against illegal immigrants. The recall petition pitted Russell Pearce against fellow Republican Jerry Lewis. Lewis led with 53.4% of the vote with all precincts reporting while Pearce got 45.3%. • Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear will win a second term, CNN projects, easily beating Republican state Sen. Steve Williams in a race that centered on jobs and the economy. Williams frequently criticized Beshear's record on creating jobs and balancing the state budget. Beshear kept a tally of the number of jobs that companies were bringing to the state on his website. • While the abortion ballot initiative in Mississippi got the most attention, another constitutional amendment that CNN projects to pass will require voters to submit a government-issued photo ID. Mississippi will be the 15th state to require photo IDs to vote. Such laws have become popular with Republicans, who say they are trying to reduce voter fraud. Democrats argue that Republicans are trying to suppress voter turnout, especially among people who tend to vote for Democrats.

"(CNN) -- Six people were killed and six were injured when a small plane crashed at Cork Airport in southern Ireland on Thursday, local officials said. Survivors were taken to a local hospital, the Cork County Council said. Four of the injured are in serious but not critical condition, and the other two are ""comfortable,"" Cork University Hospital said. The crash caused a fire and scattered debris over a large area, the Irish Aviation Authority said in a statement. The plane crashed on its third attempt to land in low visibility, they said. The airport and roads around it were closed, officials said. It was coming from Belfast in Northern Ireland. Flight NM7100, an inbound Manx2 airline flight, was due to land at Cork Airport at 9:45 a.m., the airport said. Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness expressed shock at the deaths. Robinson called it ""a terrible tragedy,"" and said his thoughts were ""with the families of the bereaved. My thoughts are also with the injured and I hope that they will make a full and speedy recovery."" McGuinness sent his ""condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of those who have lost their lives in the plane crash. My thoughts are also with those who have been injured."" In Dublin, Ireland's Prime Minister Brian Cowen said, ""my thoughts are with all of those affected by this morning's crash, including the families and friends of those who have died.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen was murdered as she was driving through Beverly Hills, California, in a random ""robbery gone bad,"" by a man who killed himself last week, according to preliminary findings in the Beverly Hills police investigation. Speculation that Chasen was targeted by a professional hit was shot down Wednesday by investigators who said much of what has been reported by the media since her killing three weeks was untrue. Harold Martin Smith, 43, was apparently riding his bicycle when he shot Chasen several times as she was on her way home from a Hollywood movie premiere party, police said. Smith later committed suicide with the same gun that was used in the Chasen killing, Beverly Hills Police Chief David Snowden said Wednesday. Smith shot himself in the head last week as police approached him for questioning as ""a person of interest"" while he was at his Hollywood apartment building. A preliminary ballistics test showed that Smith's gun was used in the slaying of Chasen, 64, said Beverly Hills Detective Sgt. Mike Publicker. ""With Mr. Smith's background, we believe most likely it was a robbery gone bad,"" Publicker said. ""We believe it was a random act."" Publicker said it appeared no connection existed between Chasen and Smith prior to slaying. ""The detectives were able to do numerous interviews and through the information obtained in the interviews, it appears that he did act alone,"" Publicker said. ""We believe his mode of transportation was by bicycle."" Authorities said the investigation, which is 60% to 70% complete, remains ongoing. ""There are additional interviews to be conducted, but this is our belief at this time,"" Publicker said. ""Carjackings are not unusual in Los Angeles, but ""in our city it's more than exceedingly rare,"" said Chief Snowden of Beverly Hills. ""It's non-existent."" ""We don't believe it was a professional hit, and this is an open and ongoing investigation,"" Snowden said. Smith, an ex-convict, pulled a handgun and shot himself as Beverly Hills detectives approached him at Hollywood's Harvey Apartments last Wednesday. The television show ""America's Most Wanted"" put police in touch with a tipster who will likely received a $125,000 reward, Publicker said.","Police: preliminary tests show a suicide victim used the same gun that killed a publicist .

"(CNN) -- The leadership of San Francisco's airport fired back Saturday at critics who had rallied around a commercial pilot who had posted videos online showing what he described as shortcomings in security. The series of videos featured scenes from inside the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and were narrated by the pilot, who pointed out the contrast between the passengers, who were heavily scrutinized, and airport employees who just passed through a single door. The footage was posted, and later removed, from the popular video-sharing website YouTube. ""A recent YouTube video, posted by a U.S. airline pilot, presents false and misleading information on SFO's security program,"" the airport said in a statement. ""The video shows a door with a card swipe and suggests that access is gained to the airfield area through this door. In fact, the door shown in the video provides access only to an employee lunchroom."" The pilot who posted the videos requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. ""I was trying to bring up the obvious, ludicrous TSA-type of security,"" he told CNN. The pilot said he didn't think much about posting his videos online in late November, but that within a matter of days his chief pilot called him to ask him to remove them because they were ""stirring a commotion."" In its statement Saturday, the airport defended its practices, stressing that there are variances in the security system based on various factors and that many layers of protection cannot easily be seen. ""Proper and effective security requires multiple layers of systems, procedures and policies that are interlaced and constantly monitored,"" the airport said. ""The vast majority of the widespread layers of this security program are behind the scenes and transparent to casual observers."" A few days after the pilot posted the videos, he said, the Transportation Security Administration told him he was being suspended from the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. As an officer in that program, the federal agency had deputized him, among others, to carry a handgun in the cockpit. The pilot said four air marshals and two local deputies then showed up at his home near Sacramento to personally confiscate his weapon. The only answer he could get from the security agency as to why he was suspended from the program was that he may have violated a regulation, the pilot said. The TSA said that it holds those serving as federal flight deck officers to ""the highest ethical standards,"" and said it took action because the pilot was in the program. ""(Participants in the flight deck officer program) must be able to maintain sensitive security information,"" said the agency's spokeswoman Sarah Horowitz. ""As the issuing authority of credentials and firearms, TSA reviews each possible violation of those standards and acts accordingly up to and including removing an individual from the assigned role."" In the aftermath of the incident, the pilot said he resigned from the program. He added that he didn't consider that divulging such sensitive information online would stir controversy. ""I didn't think anything would come of it,"" said the 50-year-old pilot, a veteran who was a maintenance test pilot. ""This is really about getting the message out and demanding intelligent security,"" Don Werno, the pilot's attorney, told CNN. ""No state secrets are being shown here. What's being shown here is a lack of security."" But the airport disagrees. ""San Francisco International Airport is proud to both an innovator and a trendsetter in aviation security,"" it said in its statement. ""SFO meets, and in many cases, exceeds every federal security requirement.""","Online videos show what a pilot claims was lax security at the San Francisco airport .

"(CNN) -- World number four Andy Murray continued his superb end of season form, coming back from a set down to beat top seed and defending champion Rafael Nadal in the final of the Japan Open in Tokyo on Sunday. Murray won last week's Thailand Open, as well as last month's Cincinnati Masters, but he looked to be on course for a sixth successive loss against world number two Nadal when the Spaniard powered through the opening set. But Murray turned things around in devastating style, taking the second set and then outplaying 10-times major champion Nadal in the decider, allowing his opponent just four points in the whole set, to complete an impressive 3-6 6-2 6-0 success. It was Murray's 21st win from his last 22 matches, his only defeat in that time coming to Nadal in the semifinals of the U.S. Open, and ensured he closed the gap to third-ranked Roger Federer ahead of next week's Shanghai Masters tournament in China. Murray told the official ATP Tour website: ""I've played well in the last few months in Cincinnati and then the U.S. Open and I now need to carry on that form into Shanghai. ""I need to keep up the wins and hopefully I'll get to the No. 3 ranking. It's not the ultimate goal, but it's the target I set myself for the last few tournaments of the year."" He added: ""It had to be some of the best tennis I have ever played in the third set. I've played some good matches against Rafa in the past but it was just very consistent. I didn't make too many mistakes and played well at important moments,"" he added. Nadal, who is again seeded to meet Murray in the final in Shanghai, conceded that his opponent was too strong for him on the day. ""Andy's serve worked fantastic at important moments. He played unbelievable and made no mistakes in the third set when he played very aggressive and hit a lot of winners."" Meanwhile, Czech Tomas Berdych claimed his first ATP Tour title in nearly two-and-a-half years with a 3-6 6-4 6-1 success over Croat Marin Cilic in the final of the China Open in Beijing. Third seed Berdych was securing his sixth career title but his first since winning on the clay courts of Munich in May 2009.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece's cabinet voted Wednesday to support Prime Minister George Papandreou's call to hold a referendum as soon as possible about the latest bailout plan, ministers coming out of the meeting told a CNN affiliate. The vote was unanimous, though some of the ministers expressed criticism prior to casting their votes, CNN affiliate Mega Channel reported. The cabinet vote came hours before German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and senior figures from the International Monetary Fund and European Union were to meet Wednesday with Greek officials at an emergency meeting in Cannes, France, ahead of the G-20 summit. Their meeting comes a day after U.S. and European stock markets tumbled after Papandreou's call for the referendum on international aid for his country. A ""no"" vote could theoretically force Greece to crash out of the euro and send shock waves through the global financial system. Papandreou is seeking public backing from the Greek people for last week's bailout deal, which took months to reach. But the move created turmoil in domestic politics, with Papandreou forced to hold an emergency Cabinet meeting late Tuesday, and angered his European counterparts. Sarkozy and Merkel issued a terse statement on Tuesday saying they were ""determined to ensure the full implementation, without delay, of decisions adopted by the summit, which are necessary now more than ever."" White House spokesman Jay Carney struck a similar note, saying Papandreou's move reinforced the need for Europe ""to elaborate further and implement rapidly the decisions they made last week."" German and French markets closed down about 5% Tuesday, while London's FTSE fell 2.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average index closed down nearly 300 points. Greece's former deputy finance minister, Petros Doukas, a member of the opposition New Democracy Party who is not currently in office, told CNN he doubted the referendum would take place. Papandreou is under enormous pressure from Europe, the markets and opposition forces within Greece to backtrack on the proposal, Doukas said. He described Papandreou's actions as a political gamble that had gone wrong, with the prime minister having tried to make the opposition parties share the pain of unpopular reforms. He suggested Papandreou would have to call elections or stand down as leader, as Greece was ""not governable"" with him as prime minister. The announcement of the referendum rattled Papandreou's hold on power, as a lawmaker defected from his party, leaving him with a majority of only two in Parliament. Milena Apostolaki announced her resignation from the PASOK party, saying the call for a referendum was ""a deeply divisive procedure."" The deal reached last week would see the country's sky-high debts cut in half, but it comes with strings attached, which have led to angry demonstrations in the streets of Greece. Reflecting that anger, Greece's opposition leader, Antonis Samaras, called Tuesday for a snap election, but it is unlikely he has the votes to force one. Papandreou has called for a vote of confidence Friday, separate from his call for a referendum on the international bailout. Elena Panaritis, a fellow PASOK lawmaker who advises Papandreou on economics, said she would support the confidence vote, saying the prime minister had been under heavy political pressure from inside and outside his party. International lenders are demanding that Athens raise taxes, sell off state-owned companies and slash government spending, which would mean firing tens of thousands of state workers. The Institute of International Finance, a global association representing many of the world's biggest banks, reaffirmed its commitment Tuesday to the bailout agreement reached last week, saying it would work closely with all parties to implement it. The European debt crisis claimed its first American victim shortly before Papandreou announced the referendum on Monday, as MF Global filed for bankruptcy protection, leaving top Wall Street creditors holding more than $2 billion in debt. The commodities and derivatives brokerage was run by ex-Sen. Jon Corzine, a former head of Goldman Sachs. Constantine Michalos, chairman of the Athens Chamber of Commerce, said Papandreou's referendum move had taken everyone by surprise. As a consequence, he said, ""Greece is facing a credibility gap as a result of the problems that have been created both on a political level and on a financial market level."" Michalos also said he saw little point in Papandreou holding a confidence vote this week if the bailout deal, which was reached after top-level negotiations in Europe, could be overturned by the Greek people just a few weeks later. One expert called the surprise plan for a referendum ""a political gamble, which adds further uncertainty to the European debt crisis."" ""The prime minister will be hoping for a vote in favor to strengthen his mandate, but if the Greek population votes against, it will leave the IMF and Greece's European partners in a very difficult situation,"" said Gary Jenkins of Evolution Securities. The planned referendum casts a shadow on the hard-fought deal that would allow Greece to write off as much as 50% of its debts to banks. The deal would wipe out 100 billion euros in Greek debt, half of what it owes to private creditors, and comes with a promise of 30 billion euros from the public sector to help pay off some of the remaining debts, making the whole deal worth 130 billion euros ($178 billion). No date has been set on the vote, although local news reports say the referendum could come in January. A ""no"" vote threatens to unravel the deal, which was greeted last week with fanfare as a way to keep debt woes in Greece and other European nations from spilling across other borders, threatening the 17 nations united under the euro currency. A weekend survey in Greece found nearly 60% opposed the debt deal reached last week in Brussels. But other surveys have shown a more complicated picture. A survey carried out last week by Kappa Research for the Greek daily newspaper To Vima showed a majority of Greeks wanted a referendum on the international rescue plan, and that more would oppose it than accept it. But in the same survey, 70% of Greeks wanted to stay in the euro, according to RBS European Economics -- a result that may not be possible if they vote ""no"" on the referendum. ""(It) clearly opens a can of worms because the referendum vote could go one of two ways,"" said Frederic Neumann, a senior economist for HSBC. ""If approved, a vote of confidence in the government's handling of the situation ... if calmer heads prevail and it can rationally be explained to the public, I wouldn't discount the measure being approved."" But, until the referendum is passed, there is added uncertainty, he said, adding, ""That's just an added headache."" Besides the Greek debt-reduction plan, last week's European Union deal pledged to quadruple the EU's bailout fund to about $1.38 trillion and to raise the capital required to help cushion the region's banks from financial shocks. CNN's Bobby Afshar, Irene Chapple, Catherine Tymkiw, Christine Theodorou, Saskya Vandoorne and Kevin Voigt contributed to this report.","NEW: Vote was unanimous, ministers tell CNN affiliate .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An Afghan employee of the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan who opened fire at a CIA annex there worked as part of a local guard force, a U.S. official said Monday. Embassy spokesman Gavin Sundwall said the lone gunman killed a U.S. citizen and wounded another in the shootings Sunday. The wounded American was evacuated to a military hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. Security personnel used a flash-bang round to stun the shooter and then killed him, according to another U.S. official who earlier provided details of the incident. The gunman shot indiscriminately, and he is not believed to have targeted the victims, the second U.S. official said. One or two civilians suffered minor wounds as people went running for cover, the official added. The American killed was a CIA employee, according to a third U.S. official. The official said the gunman fired toward the building but never entered it. All the sources spoke on condition of not being identified. The FBI is investigating the attack, along with other U.S. agencies and local authorities, a U.S. official said. Another official said the FBI is the lead agency in the investigation. CIA and diplomatic security officials also are involved. The first U.S. official said the shooter ""is believed to have worked as part of the local guard force"" and added that no motive has been established. Investigators are looking into whether the shooter was a disgruntled employee or whether he was inspired by militants. All Afghan employees go through a background security check and must pass through a metal detector each time they enter the Embassy, the second official said. ""We have no information as to whether the individual was authorized to carry a weapon or if he seized a weapon,"" the official said. Afghan troops guard the outer perimeter of the Embassy, while embassy contractors and members of the U.S. military guard the inside. The CIA building is several hundred yards from the Embassy compound and has its own entrance and security, according to another U.S. official. Embassy personnel usually travel in armored cars for meetings in the CIA facility. ""It's not possible to stop everything from happening. You can only limit it, make it highly unlikely,"" said the official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. ""The job of soldiers and diplomats and spies is to be amongst the people, getting work done. You have to have some level of trust to get anything done."" ""There is a calculated risk"" for U.S. personnel working in countries like Afghanistan, the official said. The annex area is known as a place where Embassy personnel both live and work, some in intelligence operations. A CIA spokeswoman declined to comment on the attack. Afghanistan has been the site of several high-profile attacks of late, including strikes at the NATO headquarters and the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and the assassination of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani. Rabbani had been leading efforts for reconciliation talks. The latest shooting is not believed to be related to any other recent attacks in Kabul, U.S. officials said. In December 2009, a Jordanian informant detonated a suicide bomb at a CIA base in Khost, Afghanistan, killing seven CIA employees and two others. A CIA review of the incident found that some people within the CIA and the Jordanian intelligence service were skeptical about the attacker's reliability, but those concerns had not been passed on to officers on the base. CNN's Barbara Starr, Nick Paton Walsh, Carol Cratty and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","A source says the Afghan attacker was part of a local guard force .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan world lightweight boxing champion Edwin Valero committed suicide in his prison cell after being arrested for the murder of his wife, according to the World Boxing Council (WBC). The 28-year-old had confessed to stabbing his wife Jennifer Carolina Viera de Valero in a hotel in the city of Valencia on Sunday before taking his own life, police confirmed. Valero was found in his cell hanged by his own clothes and though he showed some signs of life he later died, police chief Wilmer Flores Trosel told state television. ""A prisoner nearby heard noises inside the cell and told officials, who immediately went and found the boxer Valero hanging with his own clothes,"" he said. The WBC said Valero is the only fighter in 300 years of the sport who can boast a 100 percent knock out rate from his 27 fights. Valero, nicknamed ""The Inca,"" had recently gone into alcohol rehabilitation and was detained in March for mistreating his wife, according to media reports. He had a distinctive tattoo on his chest of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, and defeated Mexican Antonio DeMarco in his most recent fight, in February this year. A statement on the WBC's official Web site read: ""Jose Sulaiman, World Boxing Council President, and all the members of the organization, are deeply saddened, moved and in sorrow due to the tragedy that took place regarding the case of WBC Lightweight world champion, Edwin Valero, who committed suicide in his cell after having killed his wife. ""Valero was very close to the World Boxing Council President and many of its members, who witnessed the happy years of the fighter when he won his Lightweight world title on April 4th, 2009, and when he defended such title last February 6th, in Monterrey, where he was joined by his wife and two little children for two weeks, showing a behavior and a humanitarian sense that were very far from what happened. ""The World Boxing Council declares today, April 19th, 2010, a day of world mourning, as well as it informs that the organization will begin analyzing a plan to set up a way in the creation of a fund for the education of his two little children, who were left alone in life after the passing away of both of their parents.""","Venezuelan world lightweight boxing champion Edwin Valero commits suicide .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Remember when Hotmail was hot? Dick Craddock, who manages the group responsible for Microsoft's Web-based e-mail service, can still recall the day of celebration in 2004 when the Hotmail division had just posted a stunning financial quarter. Craddock, along with other Microsoft execs and developers, convened to relish in the victory. The triumph was short-lived because soon after, Google launched a competing Webmail service called Gmail, and like in the short time it takes Google to call up a search query, Hotmail instantly looked dated. Gmail gave users a gigabyte of file storage for free, while Hotmail presented a few megabytes and required users to pay for more. Gmail was fast, spam-free and let people attach files several times larger than that of Hotmail. And Gmail only showed small text advertisements, while Hotmail's pages were covered in ads, which is why the site was able to exceed financial goals during that quarter in 2004. After evaluating the options, ""it wasn't hard to pick Gmail; it just wasn't hard,"" Craddock said in an interview on Monday. ""It was a great learning experience about what really matters."" After a few years of lightning-fast growth for Gmail following its launch and at the expense of Hotmail, Microsoft reversed course. ""We set out to really invest in Hotmail and really, to rebuild it from the ground up,"" said Chris Jones, a vice president who oversees several of Microsoft's Internet applications. The Hotmail team eventually got the green light to dial down the ads while increasing development on features made available to nonpaying users. Making money directly from Hotmail ""is not the most important thing for us to optimize for,"" Jones said in an interview. ""The lesson from some of the most successful Internet companies is they build something valuable and durable."" That is a notion, Jones said, that Microsoft learned from a rival, Google, and from a partner, Facebook. It is not conventional wisdom for Microsoft, which makes most of its revenue from software sold for hundreds of dollars a package in brick-and-mortar stores. The people who write the history of technology tend to take shortcuts. Accounts of Friendster's, Myspace's and AOL's fall from grace are often summed up as: they just stopped being cool. In fact, they were less reliable and less capable than their scrappier competition. The same was true of Hotmail, but Microsoft is fighting back. The Redmond, Washington, company gathered reporters together here at an art gallery in San Francisco on Monday to show PowerPoint slides that demonstrate how Hotmail is just as feature-rich, if not more so, than Gmail. Microsoft is putting muscle behind features such as granular controls over daily-deal messages and newsletters, automatic filtering and various new functions that launch in the next few weeks. These changes are already being touted to current users of Microsoft's e-mail service in a banner that urges them to look out for ""the new Hotmail."" It's a part of a campaign to improve the brand's image, so that people aren't embarrassed to say their e-mail address ends in @hotmail.com. ""For a lot of folks, Hotmail was their first Webmail address,"" Jones said. ""Now the challenge that we're fighting, frankly, is mostly one of perception."" Hotmail still holds the highest market share worldwide, followed by Yahoo Mail and then Gmail, according to research firm ComScore. In the U.S., Yahoo is the leader, and this year, Gmail surpassed Hotmail and maintains faster growth, ComScore says. The options for free e-mail are poised to increase, with other tech giants making bids for the space that follows your name and the ""at"" symbol. Apple will discuss its iCloud service at a news conference on Tuesday, which is the first time the company will give out free e-mail access, in this case, an @me.com address, to customers. Facebook recently gave each of its 800 million users an @facebook.com alias, but few people seem eager to use them. Microsoft is hoping to regain some cool in the hopes of hanging onto the friends it still has -- and to make new ones, before the new kids take over the block.","Microsoft is hoping to improve the reputation of Hotmail .

"(CNN) -- Voters have elected a former guerrilla who became a crusader against political corruption as the new mayor of Colombia's capital. A military tribunal jailed Gustavo Petro in 1985 for his connections with the M-19 leftist guerrilla group, which was known for high-profile attacks against Colombian authorities -- including a takeover of the nation's Palace of Justice that year, which left dozens dead, including 11 Supreme Court justices. Petro, 51, is not the first Latin American leader with a guerrilla warrior background. Voters in Uruguay and El Salvador also have elected politicians who were previously involved in rebel groups. Before winning Bogota's top job Sunday, Petro, trained as an economist and business administrator, had served as a lawmaker, diplomat and presidential candidate. Speaking to a crowd of cheering supporters Sunday, Petro called his election to Bogota's top post a sign that voters were ""saying yes to reconciliation."" He vowed to incorporate ideas of other candidates into his administration -- even former Mayor Enrique Penalosa, who he soundly defeated. ""We are going to try to set up some meetings with the candidates to talk about their programs,"" he said. In the political sphere, Petro quickly developing a reputation as a persistent critic of corruption. As a senator, he led the charge against lawmakers and members of then-President Alvaro Uribe's government, accusing them of connections with paramilitary groups. In 2010, he came in third place when he ran for president in Colombia. He takes office as Bogota's mayor on January 1. He has said building homes for the needy and overhauling the education system will be among his top priorities. Journalist Fernando Ramos and CNN's Patricia Ramos contributed to this report.","Mayor-elect Gustavo Petro was connected with the M-19 guerrilla group .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing Tuesday, kicking off a two-day visit to China, his first state visit since announcing his intention to contest the Russian presidency next March. Aside from meeting his counterpart Chinese premier Wen Jiabao in the 16th Regular Meeting between the two Prime Ministers, Putin will also meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao and other Chinese leaders. Talks are expected to include negotiations on a natural gas deal worth $1 trillion that has been stalled by disagreements over price. The deal would see Russia supply China with up to 68 billion cubic meters of gas every year. ""If the deal can be reached, the trade volume will increase significantly, and this will change the fact that the economic cooperation between the two countries lags behind the political cooperation,"" said Zhao Huasheng, director of the Center for Russia and Central Asia Studies at Fudan University. ""Together with cooperation in other economic fields, China and Russia will become real strategic partners in economic terms."" Putin's arrival in Beijing comes less than three weeks after he announced his bid to reclaim the Russian presidency next year. ""The fact that Putin may become next Russian president indeed adds some political color to this visit, and its impact on bilateral relation will definitely go beyond the impact of a regular state visit,"" Zhao said. ""The meeting to some extent will set the keynote for the China-Russia relation in future. It can be described as the start of China-Russia relation in 'new Putin era',"" he added. Experts say economic cooperation between the two countries will dominate the meeting agenda. ""Since this is mainly a meeting between the two premiers, this visit will be mainly about expanding the economic cooperation and improving trade structure,"" said Jiang Yi, vice director of Research Center for Russian Diplomacy at China Academy of Social Science, the country's top think tank. Recent years have seen a steady increase in trade volume between the two countries. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, bilateral trade volume in the year to July increased by 37.4% to a record $42.2 billion compared to the previous year. The ministry forecasts that the bilateral trade volume will reach a new record in 2011, in excess of $70 billion. Among all the economic agendas, energy cooperation stands out as the main focus between Russia, a major energy exporter, and China, the world's biggest energy consumer, according to a 2010 report from the International Energy Agency. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, during Putin's visit, Chinese vice Premier Wang Qishan will hold an energy negotiation meeting with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin. ""Chinese-Russian energy cooperation is an important part of the two countries' strategic partnership,"" said Liu Weimin, spokesperson of Foreign Ministry, on Monday during a regular press conference. Putin brings with him to China a group of 160 business leaders, including the CEOs of Russian energy giants Gazprom, Rosneft and aluminum producer UC RUSAL.","Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin arrives in Beijing on two-day visit .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some private security guards hired to protect the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan say their contractor has allowed widespread mistreatment, sexual activity and intimidation within their ranks, according to the watchdog group Project On Government Oversight (POGO). A spokeswoman for watchdog group POGO said hazing at a camp for security guards went ""well beyond partying."" The group sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, and briefed reporters on its findings, which it said are based on e-mails and interviews with more than a dozen guards who have worked at the U.S. compound in Kabul. The company -- ArmorGroup, North America -- has a security contract with the State Department to provide services through July 2010, and has been cited several times for shortcomings in the security required by the contract. A U.S. Senate panel two months ago was critical of the State Department for not closely supervising ArmorGroup, after a series of warning letters from the State Department in the year leading up to the panel's inquiry. When CNN contacted Wackenhut, the corporate parent of ArmorGroup, a spokesperson there said the company would have a response Wednesday. The U.S. Embassy said Wednesday it was taking the allegations very seriously. ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of all Embassy personnel -- Americans and Afghan -- and respect for the cultural and religious values of all Afghans,"" it said in a statement. ""We have taken immediate steps to review all local guard force policies and procedures and have taken all possible measures to ensure our security is sound."" Should initiation rituals such as hazing be allowed? Sound off below . POGO says two weeks ago it began receiving whistleblower-style e-mails, some with graphic images and videos, that are said to document problems taking place at a non-military camp for the guards near the U.S. diplomatic compound in Kabul. ""This is well beyond partying,"" said Danielle Brian, POGO's executive director, after showing a video of a man with a bare backside, and another man apparently drinking a liquid that had been poured down the man's lower back. She told CNN that ranking supervisors were ""facilitating this kind of deviant hazing and humiliation, and requiring people to do things that made them feel really disgusted."" Watch claims that alleged hazing at the U.S. Embassy pose a threat to security » . ""This is not Abu Ghraib,"" she said, referring to images and videos of abuse by U.S. military troops against prisoners held at a facility in Iraq. ""We're not talking about torture,"" she continued, ""we are talking about humiliation,"" by supervisors causing a breakdown of morale, and a ""total breakdown in the chain-of-command."" In the letter POGO sent to Clinton, Brian wrote that the problems are ""posing a significant threat to the security of the Embassy and its personnel."" Among the recommendations from the group: immediate military supervision of the private security guards, a review of whether the contract should be revoked, and consideration as to whether government forces should replace private security in a combat zone.","Watchdog: Contractor providing security guards allowed ""deviant hazing, humiliation""

"Dangjin, South Korea (CNN) -- Steelmakers are known to be one of the worst polluters in manufacturing, but South Korea's newest plant claims it is designed to go green. Hyundai Steel's Dangjin plant, which sits an hour and a half south of Seoul on the west coast, is the youngest steel plant in the world and has adopted new technologies to ensure it stand out from others. By simply enclosing storage and transport routes for raw material, they are able to prevent dust particles from entering the surrounding areas. The facility, which includes 35 kilometers (21 miles) of conveyor belts fully enclosed and state-of-the-art storage domes, cost Hyundai Steel roughly $5.5 billion to build. The two blast furnaces produce eight million tons of steel a year. It is no small investment, but the steelmaker believes it will earn its way back in no time. ""With the encapsulated storage system, we minimize loss of raw material so that may be $20 million a year (that we are saving),"" said Hyundai Steel's senior executive vice president Cho Won-suk. Other steelmakers lose roughly 0.5% in raw materials annually by keeping them in the open, subjecting the material to rain and wind, according to Hyundai. The idea is simple but conventional players elsewhere see it as a large investment that would require a new layout for the steel plant. Hyundai's Dangjin plant, which blew in its blast furnace at the beginning of last year, was designed to accommodate the green system from the beginning. Dangjin also boasts its recycling byproducts emitted during the process of burning and melting raw materials. The company says it recycles 100% of its byproducts which supplies 80% of the operation energy at the plant. ""The byproduct gas contains energy and has some value. For example, it contains carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane, so the byproduct gas can be utilized for heating up furnaces in the plant,"" vice president Cho said. To make sure Hyundai is meeting its standards as a green steelmaker, it monitors its emission output around the clock which is not only reported to the government but is also open to the public. The steelmaker keeps its pollution levels below half of the government's regulations, according to Hyundai's technical research center manager, Park Eung-yeul. Its tight relationship with its sister companies, Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Construction, is also enhancing its efforts to become more green. Not only does Hyundai Steel supply car parts to Hyundai Motor, the old cars at the end of their cycle come back to the steelmaker as scrap metal to be melted down and used once again. The rougher steel produced from scrap metal can then be used at construction sites. Despite these efforts, tackling CO2 emissions remains an ongoing challenge. But the company's dedicated task force team continue the drive towards producing environmentally-friendly energy and removing the obstacles in the way of even cleaner steel production.","Hyundai is reducing emissions at its steel plant in Dangjin, South Korea .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza moved a step closer Friday to extradition to the U.S., where he faces terrorism-related charges. Abu Hamza al-Masri's followers include the ""shoe bomber"" and the only person charged in the 9/11 attacks. UK authorities had ordered his extradition, but he appealed. Britain's High Court dismissed the appeal Friday, a spokesman for Britain's Home Office said. That gives the Egyptian-born cleric, who lives in London, 14 days to apply to the High Court for permission to appeal to the House of Lords. The one-eyed, hook-handed cleric faces 11 terrorism-related charges in the U.S. They include conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping in Yemen and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad, or holy war, training camp in rural Bly, Oregon in 1999. Abu Hamza, one of the highest-profile radical Islamic figures in Britain, is already in prison for inciting racial hatred at his North London mosque. He was convicted in Britain on 11 terror-related charges and sentenced to seven years prison in 2006. If he is extradited, his British sentence could be interrupted so he could stand trial in the U.S., the Home Office has said. If he receives a prison sentence in the U.S., he would return to England to complete his sentence there before serving time back in the States, the Home Office said. Abu Hamza formerly preached at the Finsbury Park Mosque in London. His followers included the so-called ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid, who was convicted of trying to light a bomb in his shoes on a trans-Atlantic flight. They also included Zacarias Moussaoui, who was charged in the U.S. over the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The cleric was also convicted of possessing eight video and audio recordings, which prosecutors said he intended to distribute to stir up racial hatred. In all, police seized some 2,700 audio tapes and about 570 video tapes from two addresses -- one of them his home - during raids in 2003. The material included a 10-volume ""encyclopedia"" of Afghan jihad, which prosecutor David Perry described as ""a manual for terrorism."" The texts discussed how to make explosives, explained assassination methods and detailed the best means of attack. Both non-Muslims and Muslims condemned his preaching, which include praising the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S., calling al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden a hero, and describing the 2003 Columbia shuttle disaster as punishment from Allah because the astronauts were Christian, Hindu and Jewish.","Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza moves step closer to extradition .

"(OPRAH.com) -- I know you've got the major risks in your financial life well taken care of: Your 401(k) is properly diversified to help you weather market volatility, and your reserve cash fund is on call to cover life's inevitable emergencies. Good work! But I'm worried about your financial blind spots -- those pesky threats to your security that lurk behind seemingly sound decisions. Here are a few common traps, and advice to ensure that you won't get taken by surprise: . Perils of plastic . Good news: You've sworn off credit cards. Goodbye insane interest rates and fees! You're sticking with your debit card from now on. Hidden risk: Debit card transactions aren't reported to the credit bureaus, so if you don't use a credit card, you'll have less of a payment history -- which hurts your FICO credit score. How to stay on top: I love, love, love that you want to use your debit card. But to keep your credit score solid, you still need to keep a few credit cards and use them at least once every few months. Even if you think you'll never need to borrow again, your FICO credit score has a big impact. It can affect your auto insurance premium and whether a landlord will rent to you, and many employers even check it when vetting a job application. Cards issued by credit unions typically charge lower rates (generally limited to a max of 18 percent) and fewer fees. Check out CreditCardConnection.org to find the best options. Oprah.com: How to deal with credit card debt . The bond issues . Good news: You're sleeping better than ever since you moved all your retirement money out of stocks and into bonds. Hidden risk: You're approaching two land mines here. First up is inflation. Make it to age 65 and there's a good chance you'll live another 20 years or longer. (More on this in the next item.) Over a 20-year period, a 4 percent average inflation rate (the historical norm since the '50s) will reduce the purchasing power of today's dollar to about 50 cents. That will make it very hard to maintain your standard of living in retirement. Bonds aren't an ideal inflation hedge, since their historical returns are typically not much better than the inflation rate. Making matters worse, because of the financial crisis and the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep the economy growing, bond yields are at unprecedented lows. This is not a permanent situation. Soon -- maybe this year or next -- interest rates, and thus bond yields, will start to rise. When rates rise, the market price of bonds falls. That hurts your portfolio. How to stay on top: Every portfolio benefits from bonds; they provide a cushion when the stock market hits a rough patch. But avoiding stocks completely could mean your investment won't grow any faster than the rate of inflation. As a general rule, your age is a good guideline for the percentage of bonds you want -- if you're 55, put 55 percent in bonds and 45 percent in stocks. If you're worried about putting money in stocks right now, stick with mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on dividend-paying stocks. The dividend payout is a steady stream of income, much like a bond, and right now the yield on some dividend portfolios is actually higher than the yield on a five-year Treasury bond. While dividend stocks have their own risk, if you have time on your side -- at least ten years -- you can pocket that nice dividend income today, ride out the volatility, and, over the long term, potentially earn inflation-beating gains. Oprah.com: How to go green on the stock market . Live long -- and prosper? How to enjoy a long, comfortable retirement . Good news: You're likely to reach a much older age than women of previous generations. Today a woman of 65 will probably live 20 more years -- 60 percent longer than her life expectancy in 1900. Hidden risk: That means more years that your 401(k) and IRA need to support you. How to stay on top: To enjoy a long, comfortable retirement, save more today. If you're 50 or older, take advantage of the catch-up provisions: Instead of an annual 401(k) max of $16,500 in 2010, you're entitled to invest $22,000, and your IRA limit rises from the standard $5,000 to $6,000. You may also want to retire later. Working until 67 or 70 gives those funds more time to grow -- which gives you more security. You don't have to keep the high-powered career you have now; a less demanding job will still bring in valuable income. Retirement loans: on borrowed dimes . Good news: You're in a pinch, but your company allows you to borrow from your 401(k). Hidden risk: Make that plural -- there are three problems with taking your company up on that loan. First, if you leave your job, voluntarily or not, you'll typically have only a few months to pay back what you've borrowed. If you can't, the loan converts to a withdrawal on which you'll owe income tax, and if you're under 55 you'll also be hit with a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty. Second, when you pull money out of any investment, it's no longer working for your future. Anyone who took a loan from their 401(k) in early 2009 missed out when the S&P 500 stock index shot up more than 60 percent from March to December. That was a costly time to be out of the market. Third, your loan money will end up being taxed twice -- when you repay the loan it will be with after-tax dollars, and then in retirement, when you begin using your 401(k) for living expenses, you'll be responsible for the tax due on those withdrawals. How to stay on top: Make a 401(k) loan an absolute last resort. A well-maintained emergency savings fund is a far better insurance policy against unforeseen expenses. As you know, I advise saving up eight months of living expenses -- especially now, when most unemployed people need at least six months to find a new job. Kids need the darndest things . Good news: You're expecting, or you have young kids. Hidden risk: You may not be providing enough security for your family if something happens to you. How to stay on top: You can't control fate, but you absolutely, positively can make sure that your children will be financially secure, no matter what. A term life insurance policy that's at least 15 times your annual income will give your kids' guardian plenty of money to raise them according to your wishes. I know that sounds like a lot, but these policies are remarkably inexpensive. Oprah.com: Discover the pleasures of pinching pennies . Shaky foundations . Good news: The steep decline in home prices means you can afford to buy your first home. Hidden risk: It's easy to underestimate the real cost of home ownership. How to stay on top: Property tax, insurance, and maintenance can add 30 percent to your base mortgage. To see how that extra expense will affect you, plug in your price range for a home at BankRate.com to determine your monthly mortgage payment, and then add 30 percent to that figure. If the total is more than your current rent, spend six months ""playing house"" -- each month, deposit the difference between your rent and your probable mortgage payment into a separate savings account. If you can't afford this exercise, you can't afford to buy a home at that price just yet. And don't forget: Before buying a home, you must have an emergency fund that can cover your expenses for eight months. If anything happens to your job or a big expense pops up, you'll need to have the cash to pay the mortgage. Finally, don't buy if there's any chance you'll move within five to seven years. If you sell a newly purchased house, you risk making too little on the sale to cover the typical 6 percent agent's fee and your moving costs.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal transportation safety officials Wednesday issued an ""urgent"" recommendation calling for a redesign of a component on some Boeing 777 aircraft engines -- a component blamed for two major mishaps in the past year. The engines on this British Airways jet lost power as it prepared to land in London on January 17, 2008. National Transportation Safety Board investigators said the Rolls-Royce engine component played a role in the January 17, 2008, crash of a British Airways jet near London's Heathrow Airport. Both the plane's engines lost power as the plane approached the runway, and 13 people were injured in the resulting crash. Ten months later, on November 26, 2008, a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777 was in cruise flight over Montana when an engine lost power. That plane landed safely in Atlanta after pilots performed a procedure developed in response to the Heathrow crash. In both cases, the NTSB said, a build-up of ice on a fuel/oil heat exchanger restricted the flow of fuel to the Rolls-Royce engines, reducing power. ""With two of these rollback events occurring within a year, we believe that there is a high probability of something similar happening again,"" NTSB Acting Chairman Mark Rosenker said in a news release. The Federal Aviation Administration recently ordered operators of Boeing 777s that use the Rolls Royce engines to revise flight manuals to give pilots procedures to follow in certain cold weather conditions, outlining steps they should take if their jets experience a reduction of power. But the NTSB said Wednesday the FAA action does not go far enough. ""The procedure has worked and it has been effective in significantly reducing the likelihood [of an incident],"" said NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson. ""But that's not enough. We need a permanent fix."" While the emergency procedures work, they add to the complexity of flying the plane and require a descent, which could be hazardous if the plane is not at a sufficient altitude, the NTSB said. Some 56 aircraft in the U.S. fleet and a total of 228 worldwide are equipped with Rolls-Royce engines. But the NTSB stopped short of recommending the planes be grounded. Knudson said the safety board believes the new procedures will significantly address the problem until Rolls-Royce has a new component ready for installation. Rolls-Royce indicated it can have a new system ready within 12 months, the NTSB said. ""We are encouraged to see that Rolls-Royce is already working on a redesign, and we are confident that with the FAA and EASA [European Aviation Safety Agency] overseeing the process, this flight safety issue -- even one as complex as this -- will be successfully and expeditiously resolved,"" Rosenker said. The NTSB recommended that, once Rolls-Royce completes its redesign, the new system be installed on all affected Boeing 777's at their next maintenance check or within six months. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: ""The report clearly states that the Rolls-Royce equipment on this flight met or exceeded all requirements. The report also highlights the emerging issue of ice build up in commercial 'long-cold-high' routes. This is an industry-wide issue which requires detailed research that is likely to shape future regulations and requirements.""

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Paula pushed across western Cuba Thursday evening with wind gusts just under hurricane strength in some places, bringing heavy rain and high winds to the island nation, forecasters said. The storm is gradually weakening and is expected to become a tropical depression Friday, the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center said . As of 8 p.m. ET, the center of Paula was about 25 miles (45 kilometers) east of Havana, the center said. It was moving east at 14 mph (22 kph). Paula passed just south of the Cuban capital around 6 p.m. Thursday -- with sustained winds of 41 mph (67 kph) and a gust of 54 mph (87 kph) recorded in Havana -- after making landfall at about noon near Puerto Esperanza. The storm's maximum sustained winds have weakened to 55 mph (90 kph), the center said Thursday night, but wind gusts of 68 mph had been recorded earlier near Puerto Esperanza. Stronger gusts were confined to a small area near the storm's center, the center said. Paula's tropical storm-force winds have expanded to 70 miles (110 km) outward from the center, altering the landscape of a storm that has been roughly half that size for most of its duration. Forecasters said the storm was likely to stick to an east to east-northeast track, moving across western and central Cuba Thursday night and Friday. The hurricane center said that tropical storm force winds should continue to spread eastward across western and central Cuba Thursday night, primarily along the north coast. The center discontinued an earlier tropical storm watch also was for the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. Emergency management officials in the Keys said Wednesday they were keeping an eye on the progress of Paula and expected some gusty winds and rain, but no protective actions had been initiated. Forecasters predict the center of Paula will remain south of the Keys. Paula is likely to dump an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain over portions of western and central Cuba over the next two days, the National Hurricane Center said. Total maximum amounts could be 10 inches in some areas. Heavy rain could trigger flash floods and mudslides, forecasters said. The Florida Keys could see between 1 and 2 inches of rain. In addition, a storm surge is forecast to raise water levels by 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba, accompanied by ""large and destructive waves,"" the hurricane center said.","NEW: Storm is gradually weakening, with maximum sustained winds of 55 mph (90 kph)

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- As little Tatyana Larbi, aka Little Miss Muffett, sings about selling her cotton and twigs to the ""sister pigs,"" you can tell the young girl is enjoying her moment in the limelight, even if she can't see the audience's response. The mother of Brooke Stegall, 5, says opera gave her visually impaired child new confidence. The set and costumes are pretty basic. Most were made by parents and volunteers. But that doesn't matter to the beaming mothers, fathers and grandparents in the audience. The fact that these 10 children are performing this day is enough for them. All of the actors in the Pumpkin Pickle Pop Cookies Opera are visually impaired 4- and 5-year-olds. Two are blind, and the others have varying degrees of sight. All are students in Atlanta's Center for the Visually Impaired BEGIN program. But today is their last day here, and performing this 20-minute opera is their ""thank you"" to their families.  Watch an awe-inspiring opera performance » . ""These parents work so hard to make this happen,"" said Anne McComiskey, director of the program. She is very aware of the efforts that both the children and the parents put into the program. ""They have to give up vacation time from their jobs,"" she said. ""Some people travel two and three hours once a week to get here."" McComiskey says the program works with newborns, sometimes only days old, up to 5-year-olds. It helps parents understand what is possible for their visually impaired or blind children. ""First of all, we are teaching the parents how to teach their child,"" she said. ""Because some 90-odd percent of learning comes through your vision, we have to teach mommy and daddy how to do what they would do typically, a little differently."" She says with the infants, it can be even more basic. ""With a newborn, you're teaching them about their body. A lot of kids don't know they have feet. They have never seen them."" All of the children go to the center one day a week. The BEGIN program, which is an acronym for Babies Early Growth Intervention Network, was started in 1985 and has about 95 children go through the program each year. The course costs $250 to register, but financial assistance is available. McComiskey says the performance reinforces lessons learned during the course of the program. ""Because this is an opera, they are learning gestures that they wouldn't learn by watching someone else. And they are learning how to listen and respond. They are learning to work in a group. It's just many of the concepts that we have been teaching them for five years, coming to play in the opera."" Jacqueline Howard is the center's music therapist. She came up with the idea for the opera while talking with some of the teachers. She also sees lessons in the performance. ""If you have a visual challenge, you want to be safe in the space you're in, because you may not be able to see everything around you. So the movements help them feel safe in the space, and we learned to move, sing and play instruments at the same time, which is a challenge for anyone!"" Brooke Stegall, 5, played one of the five ""sister pigs"" in this opera loosely based on ""The Three Little Pigs,"" which added the twist of a few other nursery tale characters. Her mother, Rhonda, says the opera changed her daughter. ""She is just a naturally reserved child, and to see her go up there and just sing and do the motions and just smile and have fun -- it was just great."" McComiskey says that that is one of the goals of the program: to instill a sense of ""I can"" in the kids. In this case, all 10 students seem to have taken that lesson to heart. All of them will be attending mainstream kindergartens in their school districts next fall. ""That is most unusual, for a child that is blind or visually impaired to go right into a typical kindergarten,"" McComiskey said. McComiskey and the program's teachers worked hard to make sure they are more than prepared. ""We want our kids going into kindergarten ahead of the sighted children in literacy. So we want Tatyana reading Braille, and we want them to be using the long cane so that they can go to the office or whatever, just like anyone else can."" Adds Jacqueline Howard, ""I always say success breeds success, and the confidence they felt by completing this task, when they're asked to do other things, they'll remember, 'I did that. I can do anything.' "" Tatyana enthusiastically agrees after the performance. ""I am so proud of myself.""","Atlanta opera inspires visually impaired kids to ""do anything""

"(CNN) -- Actor Larry Hagman said Friday that he has been diagnosed with cancer, but noted ""it is a very common and treatable form"" of the disease. Hagman, who turned 80 last month, is best known for his role as J.R. Ewing, the son of a Texas oil tycoon on the primetime television series ""Dallas,"" and as a dashing Florida astronaut living with a 2,000-year-old genie on the sitcom ""I Dream of Jeannie."" In recent days he has been preparing for a stint on the remake of ""Dallas"" later this month. ""As J.R I could get away with anything -- bribery, blackmail and adultery,"" Hagman said. ""But I got caught by cancer."" Hagman said he will receive treatment for his cancer -- the type of which was not disclosed -- while working on the new ""Dallas."" This isn't the first health scare Hagman has faced. In 2003, he talked to CNN about his fight with cirrhosis and the 16-hour liver transplant in 1995 that saved his life. Warner Horizon Television, TNT's television production branch, which is producing the ""Dallas"" remake, issued a statement Friday expressing support for Hagman. ""We look forward to watching Larry once again work his magic by bringing one of television's most interesting, complex and controversial characters back to the screen in the new Dallas series,"" the statement said. The original ""Dallas"" series ran from 1978 to 1991. ""I could not think of a better place to be than working on a show I love, with people I love. Besides, as we all know, you can't keep J.R. down!"" Hagman said. CNN's KJ Matthews contributed to this report.","Hagman, 80, says ""it is a very common and treatable form"" of the disease .

"(CNN) -- A top Zetas drug cartel leader -- who allegedly ordered the attack and arson at a casino that killed 52 -- has been captured, Mexican defense officials said Thursday. Carlos Oliva Castillo, alias ""La rana,"" or frog, was arrested Wednesday at a safehouse without a single shot being fired, the country's Ministry of Defense said. Possibly the No. 3 man in the criminal organization, Oliva Castillo allegedly oversaw criminal operations for the cartel in three Mexican states. He was captured in Saltillo, Mexico. Though he was arrested without incident, the cartel tried to distract troops by attacking security forces in different parts of the city, the defense ministry said. The Zetas' rescue ploy failed. According to officials, Oliva Castillo was ""the principal manager"" of the ruthless Zetas in the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. He was also described as a confidant of Zetas boss Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano. Oliva Castilo began working for the Zetas in 2005 in Tamaulipas, the defense ministry said, and rose through the ranks quickly. By 2009 he was in charge of the cartel's finances in Nuevo Leon, before taking charge of all operations in that state, the ministry said. This year he assumed a wider role, the ministry said. The three northeastern states that Oliva Castillo allegedly oversaw are some of the Zetas' strongest-held territory. Authorities say that much of the violence registered in these states is the result of the Zetas fighting rival groups such as the Gulf cartel and Sinaloa cartel, for access to lucrative smuggling routes. But the Zetas -- especially in their strongholds -- have branched out from drug trafficking and into extortion of businesses, kidnappings, and human smuggling. The deadly attack that Oliva Castillo is accused of ordering is the casino arson in the city of Monterrey where 52 people died. Officials allege that the attack happened because the casino owners did not comply with payments to the cartel. Last year, the bodies of 72 migrants from Central and South America were discovered at a ranch in San Fernando, located in Tamaulipas state. The Zetas have been blamed for the mass graves and for the deaths of the migrants.","Mexico says it arrested Zetas regional boss Carlos Oliva Castillo .

"(CNN) -- Nearly four months after a P-51 Mustang veered out of control and slammed into spectators at the Reno, Nevada, air races -- killing 11 people, injuring scores of others and jeopardizing the future of the event -- race organizers Wednesday said the show will go on. The head of the Reno Air Racing Association said the association will seek permits for the full schedule of races to take place September 12-16 and is confident that it will get them. If not, he said, organizers will stage a one-time-only memorial event to commemorate those killed and injured last year, and will bring an end to the 49-year-old tradition. ""Many of the victims, their families, air race teams and fans have told us they're coming to Reno this September no matter what,"" said Mike Houghton, president and CEO of the Reno Air Racing Association, at a Reno press conference. ""And we feel it's our obligation to give them something, no matter what."" Houghton said the association is doing everything possible to assure that all features of the races will continue, including the unlimited class race, which featuring planes flying at low altitudes in excess of 500 mph. It was unclear how close spectators would be allowed and whether that would include areas in which they were killed or hurt in the September crash. The event relies on the races to attract its 200,000 fans, who contribute an estimated $85 million to the local economy, Houghton said, and it would not be economically viable as a more traditional air show. In an apparent effort to win government support for the races, the association created a ""blue ribbon review panel"" that included two well-known former government officials, former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Jim Hall and former Federal Aviation Administration official Nick Sabatini. The panel will review changes that can be made to ensure the races' safety, Houghton said. The September 15, 2011, crash came when noted pilot James Leeward's Mustang flew off course, pitching upward briefly before flying into a spectator area. Leeward and 10 spectators died, and about 60 people were injured. The NTSB is investigating the cause of the crash and is examining video that shows a piece of trim tab, an aerodynamic surface on the tail of the plane, separating from the plane at the time the pilot lost control. The crash also has prompted the NTSB to hold a one-day hearing on air show safety. That hearing will be held Tuesday in Washington. Houghton said the race sponsors, vendors and pilots he has met have ""universally"" expressed support for continuing the races, and that fan support has been ""overwhelming."" Fewer then 20% of the fans asked for refunds from the races canceled after last year's crash, he said. Houghton said the association needs permits or waivers from the FAA, the local airport authority and the city of Reno. He expressed optimism that all three entities would permit the races, but said his biggest concern is any unknown obstacle that could interfere with race plans. The crash is expected to bring a flurry of lawsuits. In a lawsuit filed by the family of deceased spectator Craig Salerno of Friendswood, Texas, lawyers argued the crash was not a ""freak accident,"" but was ""the predictable result of a reckless drive for speed by a risk-taking pilot and crew, coupled with an insatiable drive for profit"" by race organizers. The FAA said it has revised its air race policy to require all air racing organizations to go through a standardized accreditation process to ensure all air race organizations are subjected to the same review and authorization standards. The FAA said it has invited the Reno Air Racing Association to contact it when it is ready to begin the accreditation process. Once the FAA receives that notification, the FAA will select a team that will conduct a top-to-bottom review of the organization's operations, the agency said. In the 49 years of racing at Reno, 19 pilots have died in crashes. Last year's crash is believed to be the first to kill spectators.","11 people died in September when racing plane crashed into spectators .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Tibetan exile leaders, meeting in northern India to debate a potential new approach to Tibet's decades-long struggle for autonomy, have voted to stay with the Dalai Lama's current ""middle way approach,"" according to a spokesman for the spiritual leader. Some have sought Tibet's independence from China, but the Dalai Lama has sought autonomy. ""The majority of the people have spoken and have requested his holiness the Dalai Lama to continue with his middle way approach,"" said spokesman Tenzin Taklha. The meeting was called after the Dalai Lama acknowledged he had failed in his efforts to convince China to restore the territory's autonomy. He did not attend the week-long conference in Dharamsala, a town in the hills of north India where he lives in exile. He called the meeting, he said, to offer the exiles an opportunity to discuss ""the best possible future course of action"" for Tibet. Takhla said the Tibetans demonstrated that the Dalai Lama was their undisputed leader, and they hoped China would recognize him as such and negotiations toward a realistic solution could be held. There was a small minority who said they wanted to demand Tibet's independence, Takhla said. The ""middle way"" approach with Beijing is one in which Tibetans want a level of autonomy that will allow them to protect and preserve their culture, religion and national identity. In exchange, China could continue to claim Tibet as part of its territory. Some in Tibet have advocated independence from China, but the Dalai Lama has long called for genuine autonomy. Tibet is technically autonomous from the central Chinese government, but the Dalai Lama and others have said they favor real autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in China.  Learn about Tibet's history of conflict » . The resentment spilled over in March, when Buddhist monks initiated peaceful anti-Chinese protests in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. The demonstrations began March 14, the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Beijing's rule that sent the Dalai Lama into exile. The protests soon turned violent, with demonstrators burning vehicles and shops. Some protesters advocated independence from China, while others demonstrated against the growing influence of the Han Chinese in Tibet and other regions of China with ethnic Tibetan populations. The subsequent crackdown left 18 civilians and one police officer dead, according to the Chinese government. Tibet's self-proclaimed government-in-exile put the death toll from the protests at 140. China blamed the Dalai Lama and his followers for the March riots -- a charge he has consistently denied.","Tibetan exile leaders back Dalai Lama's current ""middle way approach""

"(CNN) -- Dozens of people have been killed in Central America as heavy rains continue to hammer the region. In Guatemala, the death toll has risen to 28 and close to 110,000 people have been affected so far, the state-run AGN news agency reported. Citing the president, the agency said 15,000 more people are at risk and roughly 12,000 are in shelters. ""We've been able to respond to all the requests for help we've received -- many by land because we haven't been able to fly over the areas,"" said President Alvaro Colom, AGN reported. Meanwhile in El Salvador, the government has declared a state of emergency and ordered evacuations in some of the hardest-hit areas. At least 24 have died in El Salvador, including seven children, according to the country's civil protection director. Some 13,000 people are in shelters. Central America has been hammered by torrential rain since last week, when Hurricane Jova struck Mexico as a Category 2 storm late Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- In a move that could reshape the Cuban economy, the government on Thursday announced a new law that allows for the sale of real estate. The National Assembly in August approved a plan to permit the sale of real estate, and the legislation itself officially was put on the books Wednesday. It goes into effect November 10, the state-run newspaper Granma reported. The new law allows for the sale, exchange, donation and gifting of real estate even in cases of divorce, death, or the owner leaving the country permanently. As stated, the goal of the law is to ""eliminate prohibitions and make limitations (to property ownership) flexible."" The effect of creating a housing market in the stagnant Cuban economy is uncertain. For one, the law places some limitations -- including a prohibition of the ownership of more than one residential home and one vacation home. Also, only Cuban citizens living in the country or foreigners with permanent residences in Cuba may participate in the transactions. Buyers will be required to swear under oath that they don't own other property. Under the law, in cases where the owner permanently leaves the country, the state confiscates the home and turns it over for free to any legitimate co-owners or family. Cuba has a population of 11 million people and a housing shortage. It's not unusual to find three or four generations crammed into a small apartment or divorced couples under the same roof. Before the law, a black market for real estate existed, where houses were swapped.","A new law in Cuba allowing some real estate sales goes into effect next week .

"(CNN) -- A plane crashed early Sunday in the southern port city of Karachi, killing at least eight people on board and sending flames shooting through the night sky, a Pakistani official said. The cargo plane took off at 1:45 a.m. from the Jinnah Karachi International Airport for Khartoum, Sudan, said Pervez George, a spokesman for Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority. It went down a few minutes later in the Gulistan-e Johar section of Karachi, an area where many Pakistani naval officers live. Masood Raza, a Karachi district government official, told CNN affiliate GEO News in Pakistan that the pilot appeared to deliberately bring the plane down in a less densely populated residential area in order to save lives. ""If the plane would have crashed in a (more crowded) residential area, it would have been a very big disaster for the city of Karachi,"" Raza said. All eight people confirmed dead were members of the downed aircraft's crew and all are Russian nationals, said George. A local hospital spokesman told CNN that the hospital had received five bodies by 4 a.m. The Russian-made cargo plane was carrying relief supplies, including tents, to Africa before it went down. The plane arrived in Karachi on Saturday from Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, George said. An eyewitness told CNN that he saw fire on one of the plane's wings before it crashed. Firefighters, rescue personnel and area residents rushed to the scene, with jet fuel fanning the large flames and huge plumes of smoke. The blaze was put out by 4 a.m., according to George, at which point rescue personnel continued to comb through the rubble looking for other people possibly killed or hurt. The plane appeared to hit several buildings under construction. Hospital sources told GEO News that Mohammed Raees had burns over 60 percent of his body, resulting from the crash and subsequent fire. Raees told GEO News that he was hurt after flaming parts of a building hit him and the motorcyle he was preparing to ride.","NEW: Official says the pilot saved lives by guiding the plane to a less crowded area .

"(CNN) -- The $410 billion budget President Obama signed Wednesday will make it easier for U.S. residents to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island. It also could facilitate the sale of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. The residents of Havana, Cuba, often rely on bicycle taxis for transportation. Three provisions attached to the omnibus spending bill loosened restrictions enacted by then-President George W. Bush after he came to office in 2001. Analysts see the move as a way for the new Obama administration to start thawing relations with Cuba one month before the Fifth Summit of the Americas brings together the U.S. president and 33 other leaders from the Western Hemisphere in Trinidad and Tobago. ""[Cuba] is the issue of greatest symbolic importance,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue policy institute. ""It will be seen as a test of real U.S. readiness to change in the hemisphere. What he says about Cuba will make headlines."" Hakim testified about Latin American policy Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Cuba and the United States have had a troubled relationship since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The United States broke off diplomatic relations in 1961 and imposed a trade embargo in 1962. Bush tightened some of those restrictions in recent years, most notably limiting travel to the island to once every three years for a limit of 14 days. Under the new provisions, relatives will be able to go once a year and stay for an unlimited time. In addition, the definition of relatives has been broadened to include uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces. The new measures also increase the amount of money visitors can spend. Otto Reich, who served presidents Reagan and both Bushes in a number of high-level Latin American posts, also testified Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Reich and Hakim have different perspectives on how far Obama should go on improving relations with Cuba, but they agree that attaching the latest measures to the spending bill was the wrong way to do it. ""It's important to open up Cuba, but it should be done systematically,"" Hakim told CNN. ""This is very important for the Cuban American community. It ought to be done with them at the table. If they're not involved, they're going to push back."" Initial opposition from two Democratic senators with large Cuban American communities in their states put the spending bill in jeopardy. Senators Bill Nelson of Florida and Bob Menendez of New Jersey voted for the budget Tuesday after receiving personal letters from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner assuring them that the new provisions will not alter U.S. policy. Reich said he did not like the Cuba provisions in the budget because the United States gets nothing in return. ""I'm opposed to it because of the way it was done,"" he said. ""There's a way it can be done to advance the conditions of the people in Cuba. I don't approve of the unilateral way it's being done. The embargo is a negotiating tool. We should not negotiate with ourselves, and that's what we're doing."" Hakim warns that too much should not be read into the new measures, saying, ""The fact is that this is very minor."" Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, said in a policy statement Wednesday that the new provision ""suffers from being too little and too late."" Similar measures have been attached to previous spending bills in the past eight years but Bush threatened to veto the legislation, so the language was scrapped. Senators Nelson and Menendez were most concerned with the provision that allows cash advance sales of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. Before Bush, ""cash advance"" used to mean that money would have to be paid as soon as the goods reached Cuba. But the Bush Administration said ""cash advance"" had to mean money was sent before the cargo was loaded on ships in the United States for Cuba. The language in the new spending bill reverts the meaning to the previous ""cash-on-delivery"" method favored by U.S. farmers and exporters. Some members of Congress also were concerned the new provisions would allow credit sales, which would poke major holes in the economic embargo. But Geithner's letters to Nelson and Menendez assured them this would not happen. He did tell the senators, though, the Obama administration is reviewing its policies toward Cuba. CNN State Department Producer Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Three provisions are attached to $410 billion spending bill signed by Obama .

"(CNN) -- As news of the much-awaited release of Myanmar Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi reverberated throughout the world, activists and world leaders were seizing the opportunity to make a case for democracy and human rights in this besieged nation. Myanmar -- formerly known as Burma -- has been ruled by a Marxist military junta since 1962. The military regime has cracked down on political dissidents, forcing thousands to flee. In a statement released Saturday, President Barack Obama called Suu Kyi a personal ""hero"" and called for the military regime to ""release all political prisoners, not just one."" ""The United States looks forward to the day when all of Burma's people are free from fear and persecution,"" Obama said in Saturday's statement. Suu Kyi: 'I'm very happy to see you again' ""Following Aung San Suu Kyi's powerful example, we recommit ourselves to remaining steadfast advocates of freedom and human rights for the Burmese people and accountability for those who continue to oppress them,"" he said. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said while Suu Kyi's release is a ""positive signal,"" Pillay urged the military regime to also release the remaining political prisoners still detained. ""I urge the authorities of Myanmar to now release the other 2,200 political prisoners as a clear sign that the new government intends to respect human rights and forge a new future for the country,"" she said. British Prime Minister David Cameron also said Suu Kyi was an ""inspiration"" and that the military regime must uphold its decision. ""Her detention was a travesty, designed only to silence the voice of the Burmese people,"" he said. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called for the ""unconditional release"" of all detained dissidents and said Suu Kyi's freedom should be unrestricted. ""This is the only way to ensure that the Myanmar elections of 7 November are the start of a real transition to democracy,"" Barroso said Saturday. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was ""thrilled"" by news of Suu Kyi's release. ""People who love freedom everywhere admire her and the long sacrifice she has made for her people,"" he said. ""In light of recent elections, I also hope that Aung San Suu Kyi's release will lead to the rapid inclusion of her and the Burmese citizens in governance,"" he said. Former first lady Laura Bush and former President George Bush called for Suu Kyi's release to be unconditional. ""We strongly support the aspirations of the Burmese people and their demands for basic human rights: freedom of speech, worship, and assembly,"" said Bush. In Asia, Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard called Suu Kyi's detention ""completely unjustified"" and said her government is lobbying for an opportunity to meet with her personally. ""Minister for Foreign Affairs Kevin Rudd said the government was seeking an early opportunity to speak with Aung San Suu Kyi, to convey Australia's support for her and her struggle for democracy in Burma,"" Gillard said. ""We will closely monitor her situation, including any restrictions imposed on her freedom of movement or association. Australia continues to call on the Burmese authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the more than 2000 political prisoners still detained in Burma,"" she said. China's official Xinhua news agency was less exuberant with words on Saturday. China has refrained from publicly pressuring Myanmar and has remained the Marxist regime's closest ally since the military coup 20 years ago. India has also been criticized by the United States and others for not voicing opposition to the military junta. When India accorded a red-carpet welcome in July to the top leader of Myanmar's military junta, there was little mention of human rights abuses allegedly taking place in Myanmar's prisons, critics claimed. Human rights advocates and Suu Kyi followers overseas still expressed concerns not only for repercussions of her release, but the situation of the prisoners still incarcerated. Burma Campaign UK warned that her release should not be seen as the final return of democracy in Burma and also called for the release of prisoners. ""The release of Aung San Suu Kyi is about public relations, not democratic reform,"" said Zoya Phan, International Coordinator at Burma Campaign UK in a statement released Saturday. ""I am thrilled to see our democracy leader free at last, but the release is not part of any political process, instead it is designed to get positive publicity for the dictatorship after the blatant rigging of elections on 7th November. We must not forget the thousands of other political prisoners still suffering in Burma's jails."" In Saturday's statement, Phan and the Burma Campaign UK recalled previous incidents in which her release was widely broadcast but did not come through. ""It is the third time Aung San Suu Kyi has been released from house arrest,"" the statement said. ""The last time she was released, in 2002, it was part of a U.N.-led initiative to try to persuade Burma's dictatorship to enter into dialogue leading to a transition to democracy. However, when the time came for substantive discussions the dictatorship refused to continue the dialogue. ""","Obama: Suu Kyi is a personal ""hero""

The aircraft returned to Atlanta without incident, spokeswoman Gina Laughlin said. Passengers aboard Flight 1442 from Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina, told CNN affiliate WSOC that they had been airborne about 10 or 20 minutes when one of the engines appeared to catch on fire. Laughlin could not confirm the report of flames, but said crew members reported smoke in the cabin following the incident. Passenger Ginger Heath said the incident began with a shaking sensation, followed by ""sparks, a great big boom and lots and lots of fire"" from the engine. ""After that smoke starting coming out of the air vents."" Other passengers told CNN affiliate WBTV that they heard a ""huge crashing sound"" and felt what seemed like ""bad turbulence."" ""I kind of thought I was going to die for a second,"" one passenger interviewed by WBTV said. ""A couple of people got hysterical,"" passenger Atiim Browne told WSOC. ""The lady behind me was crying. A couple of people kind of looked at it, you know, as life flashing before their eyes and stuff like that.

"(RealSimple.com) -- Here are nine common (and commonly ignored) dressing oversights -- and easy ways to fix them. Problem: Incorrectly hemmed jeans . Solution: A good tailor . Don't cut off the extra length and at the same time lose the nice crisp hemline (marked by the recognizable yellow thread). ""A good tailor should be able to preserve the original hem,"" says Guillermo Molina, owner of Guillermo Couture, in New York City. With very long pants, your tailor may have to cut off a bit of fabric above the hemline and reattach the original hems (with barely noticeable blue thread that matches the denim), but the task can usually be achieved by folding a hem up accordion-style and sewing it in place, so the original finished seam is in plain view. Real Simple: How to dress for any occasion . Problem: Peds in plain view . Solution: Partial peds . Your secret weapon against blistered toes is a pair of Peds. But make sure they're truly a secret weapon. ""Visible Peds are a classic faux pas,"" says Leah Feldon, author of ""Does This Make Me Look Fat?: The Definitive Rules for Dressing Thin for Every Height, Size, and Shape"" (Villard, $15, amazon.com). To avoid peekaboo nylons, skip the skimpy stockings altogeter or try Hue Toe Covers ($15 for three pairs, barenecessities.com), which cover only the front half of the foot. A bit of padding on the bottom provides a cushion and keeps the cover from sliding and scrunching into the toe of your shoe. Real Simple: Avoiding wardrobe blunders . Problem: Unopened vent . Solution: Scissors . Jackets, blazers, and skirts often come with vents that are tacked together with thread. ""Don't forget to snip the string once you bring your item home from the store,"" says JoAnna Nicholson, author of ""Dressing Smart for Women: 101 Mistakes You Can't Afford to Make...and How to Avoid Them"" (Impact Publications, $17, amazon.com). Besides being a potential source of embarrassment, a tacked-together vent may also increase your chances of ripping your garment when you take a large step or reach for something on the top pantry shelf. Real Simple: Old clothing gets a second life . Problem: A gaping blouse . Solution: Velcro . Your favorite shirt was dried once too often, and now it's a bit snug, with buttons that appear to be hanging on for dear life. ""You don't want your coworkers staring at your chest, waiting for a button to pop off onto the conference table,"" says Clinton Kelly, cohost of TLC's ""What Not to Wear."" To avoid this scenario, sew a small piece of Velcro between the buttons or use a piece of double-stick tape. That way your shirt will stay flush against your skin, buttons will remain attached, and your assets will be tucked away from Bob in Accounting's sight. Problem: Cropped pants with boots . Solution: Taller boots . Once considered a summer-only staple, Capri pants are now available in thicker, fall-friendly fabrics, such as wool and tweed. But don't wear them with your lowest pair of boots. ""Low ankle boots paired with cropped pants look dowdy, because they break up your silhouette,"" says Stacy London, cohost of TLC's ""What Not to Wear."" ""Wearing high boots that completely cover the calves and a few inches of skin underneath the pants has a more elongating effect,"" she says. Real Simple: New uses for things in your closet . Problem: Peekaboo lingerie . Solution: A nude bra . White underwear may seem demure and understated next to that rack of red lace skivvies in the department store, but it screams ""Look at me!"" when worn under white clothing. If you want your unmentionables to be unnoticeable underneath a favorite white T-shirt or blouse, wear a bra that is close to your skin tone (this holds true for all underwear). Problem: Visible tag . Solution: Seam ripper . Your Sealy Posturepedic mattress may have come with a DO NOT REMOVE label, but your brand-new scarf didn't. So throw needless caution to the wind and snip the tags on scarves, sheer blouses, and any other wardrobe piece with an unsightly label. Use a seam ripper in lieu of scissors to easily remove stitches holding the tag in place, but beware of tags sewn directly into a seam, says Audrey Smaltz, founder of the Ground Crew, a backstage-management company for fashion shows. For these use a small pair of scissors to cut the tag just below the seam (so the tiny bit of tag is barely noticeable). Real Simple: Dress to flatter your figure . Problem: A bare midriff . Solution: Layering . Pant rises have gotten lower (and lower), but shirts, sweaters, and blouses have stayed the same. The result? An exposed midsection that leaves you looking like a teen pop sensation. Rather than banishing your favoriteâ€•and most flattering -- pair of pants to the back of the closet, layer a lacy tank top underneath a sweater. A hint of added color and texture keeps your tummy hidden and creates a more interesting, modern look. Another benefit: Um, how about warmth? Problem: Visible panty line . Solution: Smooth briefs . You want all the attention on you, not your tush. A visible panty line draws attention to your backside (making it look larger), but don't assume a lifetime of wearing thongs is your only option. ""Panties are more demure and chic, and they are also a lot more comfortable,"" says Simon Doonan, creative director of Barneys New York. Jockey No Panty Line Promise briefs ($9.50, jockey.com) have flat seams that are only 1/8 inch wide, preventing them from cutting into your skin. These full-coverage briefs end below the curvature of your bottom, completely covering (not bisecting) the area where pants tend to be most snug.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, speaking to a gathering of gay and lesbian activists, said Saturday that he is committed to equality, citing the repeal of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy as an example. Obama said his accomplishments on gay rights issues have been substantial since he last headlined the annual National Dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, in 2009. He acknowledged ""we have more work to do,"" including on the issue of bullying. The president currently supports same-sex civil unions, and has said his views on gay marriage are ""evolving."" He recently announced his support of the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Organizations working actively to legalize same-sex marriage say they hope Obama eventually changes his stance. While Obama spoke Saturday about equality, he did not speak on the marriage issue. The president chided participants in a Republican presidential debate last month for not rebuking members of the audience who booed a gay soldier who asked about the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" ""We don't believe in standing silent when that happens,"" Obama said of the debate incident. ""You want to be commander-in-chief, you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States even when it is not politically convenient."" After the debate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said he hadn't heard the booing when the question was asked. Santorum was being asked the question when the incident occurred. Obama spoke of growing tolerance measured, he said, by ordinary Americans: . ""A father realizes he doesn't just love his daughter but also her wife."" Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said after the speech that Obama reaffirmed commitment to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. ""It was a remarkable experience to see openly gay and lesbian uniformed service members in the audience be able to salute their commander in chief"" about the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" Obama's remarks were delivered to a key constituency that hasn't always been receptive to the president's policies and style of leadership. ""I'd like to see the president bring his message of support for the freedom to marry to a broader audience, perhaps in a conversational setting, so that all Americans can hear him talk about why marriage matters to loving gay and lesbian couples and their families,"" said Evan Wolfson, the founder and president of Freedom to Marry. ""It is important that the president lay out the case for Americans opening their hearts to the values of fairness and treating others as they would want to be treated."" Wolfson, along with other organizations advocating for legal same-sex marriages, said the Obama administration had made significant progress on some issues, but that support for marriage equality was still an important goal. ""We applaud the administration's progress, while we also encourage him to 'evolve faster' on supporting full marriage equality,"" Stuart Gaffney, media director for Marriage Equality USA, said Saturday. He said he wasn't aware of any opposition within his organization to the HRC's selection of Obama as their keynote speaker. ""We look forward to the day soon when our president stands with that pro-equality majority,"" Gaffney added. The Log Cabin Republicans, an organization that represents gay and lesbian conservatives, said Obama's appearance Saturday night was more about politics than substantive policy change. ""President Obama's appearance at the Human Rights Campaign Dinner this evening is more emblematic of their role as an ostensibly partisan organization than a representation of the gay and lesbian community,"" said Christian Berle, the group's deputy executive director. Berle said Obama's stance on gay marriage didn't match that of most Americans. ""As all Americans are becoming open to marriage equality, the president is taking a retreat,"" Berle said. ""Instead he is turning to the gay community for money and applause. ""If the president wants to deserve all the money and adulation he has already received from the gay community, he should announce his firm support for everyone's freedom to marry,"" Berle said. Saturday's event was expected to draw 3,000 gay activists, and took place at a convention center in downtown Washington. The speech was streamed live online. A CNN/ORC International poll taken Sept. 9-11 showed 53% of Americans believe marriages between gay and lesbian couples should be considered valid. That number has steadily been rising in CNN/ORC International polls since 2008. CNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report.","NEW: President tweaks GOP hopefuls over debate incident .

"New York (CNN) -- Legendary and curmudgeonly TV commentator Andy Rooney offered his final remarks Sunday on the news show ""60 Minutes,"" capping a career that has spanned more than six decades. In his final essay, delivered around 8:15 p.m., Rooney said, ""This is a moment I have dreaded. ""I wish I could do this forever. But I can't,"" he said. ""But I'm not retiring. Writers don't retire, and I'll always be a writer."" CBS announced Tuesday that the upcoming program, five days later, would be the last one for the 92-year-old award-winning writer, essayist and commentator. He has been with the network -- first as a writer for ""Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts"" -- since 1949, and been part of the ""60 Minutes"" crew since 1978. ""There's nobody like Andy, and there never will be. He'll hate hearing this, but he's an American original,"" CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager said in a release announcing Rooney's exit. The original essay offered Sunday was Rooney's 1,097th for the program. In it, he described himself simply, not as a ""television personality,"" but rather as ""a writer who reads what he's written."" ""A writer's job is to tell the truth,"" he said. ""I know I've been terribly wrong sometimes, but I think I've been right more than I've been wrong."" Earlier in the show, Morley Safer -- himself a 79-year-old journalist and a ""60 Minutes"" staple since 1970 -- interviewed Rooney about his personal and professional life. Rooney attended Colgate University until he was drafted into the Army in 1941. In February 1943, he was one of six correspondents who flew with the 8th Air Force on the first American bombing raid over Germany. Last year, Rooney received the Overseas Press Club of America President's Award for these reports. The television commentator admitted Sunday that he doesn't sign autographs and rarely responds to fan mail, telling Safer he didn't ""want to answer an idiot who would have the bad sense to write me a letter."" Rooney has also engendered controversy, such as his weekslong suspension in 1990 from ""60 Minutes"" for remarks that offended some gay viewers. But he's better known for his sharp commentaries and public persona as someone fed up with everything from desk clutter to chocolate chip cookies to door knobs. In his time at ""60 Minutes,"" Rooney also has contributed many deeper pieces in the wake of events like the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the ""shock and awe"" campaign to start the 2003 Iraq war -- a phrase he scathingly said ""makes us look like foolish braggarts."" Safer described his longtime colleague as ""America's favorite grouch-in-chief,"" saying Rooney used his ""loud whiny voice ... speaking up for citizens fed up with everything."" ""There have been many curmudgeons on television over its long history,"" Safer said affectionately. ""None has been so long serving in that role as Mr. Rooney.""","NEW: Morley Safer says Rooney spoke up ""for citizens fed up with everything""

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Kevin Bacon is not the kind of guy to look back at his past work. But when the studio unearthed his audition tape from 1984's original ""Footloose,"" he couldn't help himself.

"(CNN) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency issued a critical report Tuesday saying that it has ""serious concerns"" about Iran's nuclear program and has obtained ""credible"" information that the Islamic republic may be developing nuclear weapons. The IAEA report, the most detailed to date on the Iranian program's military scope, found no evidence that Iran has made a strategic decision to actually build a bomb. But its nuclear program is more ambitious and structured, and more progress has been made than previously known. ""The agency has serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program,"" the report said. ""After assessing carefully and critically the extensive information available to it, the agency finds the information to be, overall, credible. The information indicates that Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device."" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the report had just arrived and refrained from commenting on details at an afternoon briefing. But a senior U.S. official called the report ""a big deal."" ""The report is very comprehensive, credible, quite damning, and alarming,"" the official said. Read the IAEA report here . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad slammed the report as a fabrication of facts aimed at satisfying U.S. allegations about Iran's nuclear program. Ahmadinejad essentially called Yukiya Amano, the director general of the IAEA, a U.S. puppet and said the United Nations agency has no jurisdiction in Iran. ""The Americans have fabricated a stack of papers and he keeps speaking about them,"" he said on state-run Press TV. ""Why don't you do a report on the U.S. nuclear program and its allies? Present a report on the thousands of U.S. military bases where Washington has nuclear arms that threaten global security."" The IAEA had released another report on Iran in September but this one was highly anticipated because of the military aspect. Since 2002, the IAEA has regularly received new information pertaining to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile, the report said. It said Iran has made ""efforts, some successful, to procure nuclear related and dual use equipment and materials by military related individuals and entities"" and has acquired nuclear weapons information from ""a clandestine nuclear supply network."" It has also worked on mastering the design of a nuclear weapon and tested components, the report said. The IAEA said the some of the activities have both civilian and military applications, but others are specific to nuclear weapons. Iran has repeatedly insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes only. According to the IAEA report, Iran is believed to have continued weapons research and technology development after 2003, when the intelligence community thought Iran had stopped. Instead of halting, it seems Iran took a temporary hiatus at the time, although the program progressed at a more modest pace since then, the report said. After the report's release, top Republicans in Congress called on President Barack Obama's administration to ratchet up economic sanctions against Iran. Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, raised the fear that Israel would attack Iranian nuclear facilities without further steps by the United States and its allies. Rogers, R-Michigan, said new sanctions should cut off the supply of refined fuel to Iran and target its central bank, which he said is being used to finance Tehran's nuclear program. ""If we talk about it for a long time, if we're not really leading on it, I will tell you we leave this option to the Israelis,"" he told CNN's ""John King USA."" And in a written statement, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen called on Congress to pass two bills targeting Iran's energy sector. The Florida Republican leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which recently sent legislation to the House floor to do just that. ""If fully implemented, they have the potential to cripple the regime's ability to continue its nuclear program,"" she said. ""If the Iranian regime acquires nuclear weapons capabilities, the U.S., Israel and our other allies in the region and around the world will face an unimaginable threat to our security. The clock is ticking."" Previous IAEA reports have cited concerns by the organization that Iran has been seeking to develop nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles to deliver them. Word of the latest report drew strong comments in Israel, where talks of how to deal with Iran have recently hit fever pitch. Israel considers Iran its arch-nemesis for its repeated innuendos about the destruction of the Jewish state. Ahead of the report's release, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned that his nation would consider every option in countering Iran's bomb-making capabilities. ""Israel does not want a confrontation, but if it happens, the state of Israel will not be destroyed and there will not be 10,000 dead and not even 500 dead in any possible scenario,"" Barak said Tuesday on Israel Radio. Iranian Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said Iranian armed forces were in ""full combat readiness and will give a crushing response to those daring to attack the country,"" IRNA said. The United States, Vahidi said, was trying to ""promote Iranophobia"" in a bid to attain its ""sinister goals."" Western powers have long suspected that Iran's nuclear program is geared toward weapons development. The United States is looking to increase the heat on Iran, including a possible strengthening of existing sanctions on Iran's financial and banking sectors and additional political pressure -- all of which could be applied by the United States alone or in coordination with other allies. The United States also hopes international organizations, such as the United Nations, will take steps to further isolate Iran diplomatically. Officials said that one of several options being considered is sanctioning the Central Bank of Iran, although the United States is mindful of the impact such a move could have on oil prices during a time of global economic turmoil. U.S. officials said the Obama administration will use the report to lobby the international community to slap new economic sanctions against Iran. Obama said he discussed the upcoming report with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Cannes, France, during a meeting of the G-20 industrialized nations. The U.S. president said the two leaders ""agreed on the need to maintain the unprecedented international pressure on Iran to meet its obligations.""

"(CNN) -- Tests detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 U.S. Navy helicopter crew members when they returned to the USS Ronald Reagan after conducting disaster relief missions in Japan, the military said Monday. No further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water, the Navy said. In addition, the Navy said the U.S. 7th Fleet has temporarily repositioned its ships and planes away from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after detecting low-level contamination in the air and on its planes in the area, the Navy said. One ship was operating about 100 miles northeast of the power plant when ""airborne radioactivity"" was detected, the Navy said. The Navy's statement, however, provided some perspective, noting that the maximum potential radiation dose received by personnel when the ship passed through the area was ""less than the radiation exposure received from about one month of exposure to natural background radiation from sources such as rocks, soil, and the sun."" On Sunday, the USS Ronald Reagan started delivering aid in the coastal regions of Japan's Miyagi prefecture. Crew members, in conjunction with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Forces, conducted 20 sorties delivering aid pallets. Eight U.S. and Japanese helicopters were used to distribute the pallets, according to Sgt. Maj. Stephen Valley of U.S. Forces Japan.

"(CNN) -- A shootout in a border city that leaves five alleged drug traffickers sprawled dead on the street and seven police wounded. A police chief and his bodyguards gunned down outside his house in another border city. Four bridges into the United States shut down by protesters who want the military out of their towns and who officials say are backed by narcotraffickers. Mexican police carry a body after a clash with gangs that left 21 dead in the state of Chihuahua on February 10. That was Mexico on Tuesday. What is most remarkable is that it was not much different from Monday or Sunday or any day in the past few years. Mexico, a country with a nearly 2,000-mile border with the United States, is undergoing a horrifying wave of violence that some are likening to a civil war. Drug traffickers battle fiercely with each other and Mexican authorities. The homicide rate reached a record level in 2008 and indications are that the carnage could be exceeded this year.  Watch a reporter duck to avoid gunfire » . Every day, newspapers and the airwaves are filled with stories and images of beheadings and other gruesome killings. Wednesday's front page on Mexico City's La Prensa carried a large banner headline that simply said ""Hysteria!"" The entire page was devoted to photos of bloody bodies and grim-faced soldiers. One photo shows a man with two young children walking across a street with an army vehicle in the background, with a soldier standing at a turret machine gun. Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, calls it ""a sickening vertigo into chaos and plunder."" By most accounts, that's not hyperbole. ""The grisly portrait of the violence is unprecedented and horrific,"" said Robert Pastor, a Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s. ""I don't think there's any question that Mexico is going through a very rough time. Not only is there violence with the gangs, but the entire population is very scared,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy center. Speaking on a news show a few weeks ago, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called it a civil war. Birns agrees. ""Of course it's a civil war, but that only touches the violence of it,"" he said Wednesday. ""It's also a civic conflict, as an increasing number of people look upon the law and democratic values as something that can be violated."" Hakim is not prepared to go that far. ""One has to be careful and not overdo it,"" he said. ""Mexico is a long way from being a failed state. Mexico has real institutions. It paves roads and collects the garbage. It holds regular elections."" Enrique Bravo, an analyst with the Eurasia consulting group, points out that the violence so far is mostly affecting just drug gangs and is primarily localized along the U.S. border and Mexico's western coast. The violence along the border is particularly worrisome, analysts say. ""The spillover into the United States is bound to expand and bound to affect U.S. institutions,"" Birns said. Pastor and Hakim note that the United States helps fuel the violence, not only by providing a ready market for illegal drugs, but also by supplying the vast majority of weapons used by drug gangs. Pastor says there are at least 6,600 U.S. gun shops within 100 miles of the Mexican border and more than 90 percent of weapons in Mexico come from the United States. And it's not just handguns. Drug traffickers used a bazooka in Tuesday's shootout with federal police and army soldiers in Reynosa, Mexico, across the border from McAllen, Texas. ""The drug gangs are better equipped than the army,"" Hakim said. Pervasive corruption among public officials is central to the drug cartels' success. ""There is so much money involved in the drug trade, there is so much fear involved in the drug trade, that no institution can survive unaffected,"" Birns said. ""This has really revealed just how corrupt Mexican officeholders are,"" Hakim said. In one recent instance, Noe Ramirez Mandujano, who was the nation's top anti-drug official from 2006 until August 2008, was arrested on charges that he accepted $450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers while in office. Such dire problems call for a new way of looking at the situation, some say. ""The unthinkable is happening,"" Birns said. ""People are beginning to discuss decriminalization and legalization. ... There's only one thing that can be done: Take the profit out of it."" Pastor calls the problem in Mexico ""even worse than Chicago during the Prohibition era"" and said a solution similar to what ended that violence is needed now. ""What worked in the U.S. was not Eliot Ness,"" he said, referring to the federal agent famous for fighting gangsters in 1920s and '30s. ""It was the repeal of Prohibition."" That viewpoint has picked up some high-level support in Latin America. Last week, the former presidents of Mexico, Colombia and Brazil called for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in strategy on the war on drugs at a meeting in Brazil of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy. ""The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results,"" former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said at a news conference, in which the 17-member commission's recommendations were presented. Mexican President Felipe Calderon has taken the war on drugs to the cartels and some say it's not working. ""It's as if the burden of being the main arena of the anti-drug war has overwhelmed Mexican institutions,"" Birns said. ""The occasional anti-drug battle is being won, but the war is being lost. And there's no prospect the war is going to be won."" In the meantime, the killings will continue at a record pace. On Wednesday, the Mexican cities of Torreon and Gomez Palacio reported at least eight shootouts involving heavily armed men. The toll: seven dead, seven wounded.","Drug-related conflicts bring waves of violence, death that some liken to a civil war .

"(CNN) -- Should zombies rise up someday soon and take over the world because of an unidentified plague or virus that's caused the collapse of modern society as we know it, how would you react? Such is the fundamental question of AMC's widely successful show ""The Walking Dead,"" which returns this Sunday for its second season. Based on Robert Kirkman's comic book, the series is one of the more odd yet complex dramas on television today. At its core, it's about survival and the psychological stress that spending every waking moment together has on a small group. But that could be said about all human beings in that surviving the world is something we do on a daily basis; the trick with ""The Walking Dead"" is that a pack of ravenous zombies could be lurking around the corner, ready to make you into dinner. Viewers are consistently presented with questions of morality, instinct and terror, where plots are less about discovery -- there's no race for the cure -- and more about the struggle to exist. CNN checked in with ""The Walking Dead"" showrunner/executive producer Glen Mazzara to see what's in store for season two, how the show finds its storytelling voice and just how they get that authentic zombie feel. CNN: On average, how much are you thinking about zombies each day? Mazzara: All of them. I wake up thinking about zombies. How do I keep them scary? What's new, what's different, what's fun that we can do with zombies? CNN: How did this show become so popular on just a six-episode first season? What's the appeal? Mazzara: It's visceral. There's an immediacy for anyone watching it, where they think, ""what would I do?"" People buy into the idea that a plague could wipe out things. We've seen that, and it's in the zeitgeist now. It's playing on the everyman level where it's about the survivors and not about what happened to the collapse of government or infrastructure. You get in the car, and it runs out of gas, and then what? Meanwhile, you're being chased by zombies. CNN: Remember the swine flu? That was a legit panic. Mazzara: Yeah. It's like when you're watching a horror movie and the people move into a haunted house. And you're wondering, why didn't think just move out? Everything our survivors are doing, hopefully, strikes people as realistic. They're making decisions that ordinary people would make. And none of those decisions have very good consequences. CNN: There's also weird psychological dynamics between the characters where they have to get along while also ensuring that they survive, they want to survive, and everyone around them survives too, because as far as they know, they're it. Mazzara: Right. Our characters are definitely flawed. But they're stuck together because, hopefully, there's survival in numbers. It's an interesting dynamic that we're going to play out all season where people are deciding, are they better off with the group or without? CNN: In a few of the articles that have come out, you mention the desire to showcase your own storytelling voice. What would that entail, exactly, for the viewer? Mazzara: Part of what I hope to do this season is really focus on the character of Rick and his questions of leadership. Taking over a successful show, I'm facing my own questions of leadership, so that's easy to write. But I feel that the work I've done in the past, especially on ""The Shield,"" where it was a very surprising, violent show, yet grounded work -- that's something I'm trying to bring to this piece as well. Because it's a heightened reality, one where people are being chased by zombies, you have to be careful not to tip that line where it becomes unrealistic. You have to be grounded, and that's something we worked very hard on ""The Shield"" to achieve. At the same time, it can't be bleak. It has to be hopeful. Otherwise, it becomes too depressing. The show this year has a lot of heart. It is about the moments of personal heartbreak between the characters; it's something I'm excited about and the other writers have bought into. It's something we see as an important part of the season. CNN: For viewers, there's always this idea that a ""walker"" could appear and eat your face. How do you develop characters that are more than just ""scared"" but also still keep the viewer psychologically afraid? Mazzara: Our characters do deal with it in different ways. Some do lose hope; some have a sense of humor; some rise to the challenge; some develop in a way that they couldn't in the pre-apocalyptic world. For example, Glenn or Andrea, when she comes into her own this season. They have new roles or opportunities available to them before the zombies took over. We're trying to explore it in a lot of different ways, where it's individual to each character. CNN: Back to the zombies: Are there certain guidelines the actors have to follow to get that ""authentic zombie feel""? Mazzara: Greg Nicotero is our zombie king. He actually runs a zombie school, where he brings in extras and actors, where he teaches them all about zombies. Depending on how they do, he positions them in the shot. The better zombies get more makeup and are more up-front. Those zombies who are not as scary, they're more in the back of the shots or the edge of the frames. What's great about Greg is when the writers have questions like ""would a zombie do this?"" and we call Greg and talk through a lot of zombie science and zombie law. He's our resident expert. CNN: Obviously they're hideous, but they all have a different lurch. Mazzara: Yeah, I think that's how Greg is working with them. He spends a lot of time making sure each zombie can be featured. Also, if you think about it, every zombie is an individual who died. You want to make them individual. CNN: As the show evolves over season two, what are some of the larger thematic issues you see playing out? Mazzara: Rick's dilemma of trying to lead his group to a save haven and the romantic triangle between Lori, Shane and Rick. That really complicates life as everyone wrestles with what they know, what they think they know and what they don't know. And a question we want to handle is, what is life like for the children in this world? Do they represent hope, or are they just fodder for the zombies? That's the question: How much hope is there? We have a lot of themes we're juggling every episode. CNN: You take out the phrase ""post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland,"" and much of it could be applied to what's going on today. Mazzara: That's the whole trick. That's something that sometimes our character's step back from the horror, and they realize that. How things have changed. Has there been any guarantee of hope and survival? Has it all been just an illusion? Is this the real world, where we're just in the doorway between life and death? It's interesting, and this is what we want to see our characters wrestle with. Our show revolves around character; it doesn't rely on revelation. No one knows why the zombies took over, but it's not about finding the cure. It's about staying alive and figuring out what to do. Our concerns are immediate.

"(CNN) -- At 31, Sean Parker has a lot more going for him than Justin Timberlake. As the co-founder of music-sharing service Napster and the former president of Facebook, he's an Internet pioneer. He's a billionaire. And he throws a hell of a party. Last week, during Facebook's f8 conference in San Francisco, Parker transformed an empty warehouse into one big VIP room, complete with a lavish buffet and celebrity guests. Despite having only two days to plan the event, he somehow managed to get Snoop Dogg, the Killers and Jane's Addiction to perform for a few hundred invited guests. Estimates put the party tab at $1 million or more. The purpose of the shindig was to celebrate the U.S. arrival of Spotify, the music-streaming service in which Parker is a major investor. Spotify also is partnering with Facebook to let users play and share music within the social network. The event featured an onstage chat between Parker and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. Beside every chair in the media's seating section sat a bottle of high-end tequila. Of the hundreds of media events I've attended over the years, this is the first time I've seen that. Not in attendance was Timberlake, the singer-turned-actor who portrayed Parker as a backstabbing opportunist in last year's ""The Social Network."" In past interviews, Parker has called the movie ""a complete work of fiction."" After the Killers played, I sat down with Parker for a few minutes in a private area upstairs. The first thing we talked about was Napster. I mentioned that I would never forget that feeling of downloading free music, that it felt like you had won one of those contests where you could fill up your shopping cart for free. ""I still hear that a lot,"" he told me. Here are a few excerpts from our talk, edited for clarity: . On his affinity with Napster co-founder Shawn Fanning: . ""Fanning and I immediately realized that we had an interest in more than just computers and software and hacking and security, that we actually had an interest in doing something with a broader cultural importance. One of those ideas was Napster."" On being a billionaire . ""I definitely wanted to earn my freedom. But the primary motivation wasn't making money, but making an impact. I think the perception of wealth and power is that things just become easier and easier when in reality as you raise the stakes things become more stressful. You just keep pushing yourself harder and harder to achieve more and more -- I don't think it's ever quite as glamorous as it appears on the outside."" On Apple's Steve Jobs . ""Steve is one the greatest business artists in history and has had more impact through his product design in Apple than any other CEO."" On Timberlake's unflattering depiction of him . ""It's a blessing and a curse in the sense it definitely raised my profile somewhat -- that character in the film played by Justin Timberlake represents a set of values that I just don't agree with. It's difficult watching a character using your name and interacting with people [while] supposedly [doing] a portrayal of you."" On his business role . ""Early on I wanted to run a company, but I quickly realized there was this other model available. Maybe I'm blazing a new path with this model because you don't typically see this. You see investors who have portfolio companies but aren't very active, or entrepreneurs who typically run one company for their entire life, or occasionally, serial entrepreneurs who do a series of small companies. But they typically run them for a fairly long period of time. I've been doing a hybrid of investing and entrepreneurship, which I think initially I wasn't set out to do. But I realized it fit my personality.""","Sean Parker throws $1 million party to celebrate arrival of Spotify .

"(CNN) -- Magnificent snow-peaked summits and quaint thousand-year-old villages provide the backdrop for an unforgettable adventure in Nepal. Exploring the dramatic landscape on foot is nothing short of extraordinary, trekkers say. ""[One night] the back doors were open towards the view of Mount Everest and the other peaks of the Himalayas. It was so beautiful with snow-capped mountains and the sky was full of stars. I think that was one of the most magical moments I've ever had,"" says iReporter Kuna Rajandran, who trekked to Everest base camp in April. Planning a Nepal expedition may seem daunting at first -- and you will be challenged -- but in the end, itÂ¹s worth it. You will come away with some of the greatest memories of your life, from savoring locally cooked meals at teahouses to soaking in breathtaking views of the high Himalayas, according to adventurers who've made the trip. There are endless options when it comes to planning a trek in Nepal. One of the most popular routes is the Annapurna Circuit, which loops around the base of the Annapurna range. And, of course, the more difficult Everest base camp trek is a magnet for many visitors. Worlds away in Kathmandu . Experts urge travelers to be wary of individual porters and guides who approach you on the streets of Kathmandu. They are most likely uninsured, cautions Mohan Lamsal, general secretary of Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal (TAAN). Have a detailed discussion with your chosen trekking company to assess their professionalism, Lamsal advises. While booking in advance is a sure thing, some adventurous iReporters say making arrangements in Kathmandu is a convenient way to cut out the middleman. Be careful not to overestimate your abilities. Even if you feel completely comfortable with the people and the landscape and think you can make the trek on your own -- don't. Trekking with at least one companion is a must, especially if you're a beginner, experienced trekkers say. Since both the Annapurna base camp and Everest Base camp treks are located in conservation areas, you will need permits, said iReporter Barry Wenlock, a Kathmandu resident and an experienced Himalayan trekker who has been leading tours since 1995. You can get permits before you begin or upon entry into the parks. Additionally, every trekker needs a Trekkers' Information Management System (TIMS) pass. You or your trip organizer can get this card, which is part of a database that stores visitor information for safety reasons. When deciding on when to make your trek, there is generally one rule of thumb: Avoid the monsoon season (June through August). The most popular times to trek are late spring (March and April) and early to mid-fall (October and November), but keep in mind that is also when the trekking routes are busiest. To beat the rush, try going a week or two earlier or later, suggests Wenlock. ""There are such beautiful forests [at the foothills of the Annapurna], and it's Nepal's primary rhododendron forest, so if you visit there in the last week of March, first week of April, the rhododendrons are full and it's an absolutely staggeringly beautiful place. And the pink and red rhododendrons all up the hillside, a few magnolias mixed in, some jasmine,"" Wenlock says. Before heading to Nepal, it's important not only to prepare your itinerary, but also your body. Even the mild or ""Nepali Flat"" parts of the ""easier"" Annapurna trek have their fair share of steep inclines. ""Walking around the golf course isn't enough -- you really need to do uphill walking. You can do that for a few weeks before you come, that will make it much easier,"" Wenlock says. It's cold in Nepal -- really cold. Weather-appropriate supplies are a must for any trekker, novice or expert. Remember to pack your warmest down jacket and broken-in hiking boots as well as sun and eye protection. Based on his experience trekking the Annapurna Circuit in 2009, iReporter Dean Gakos, an avid hiker, recommends watching out for knock-off gear, like fake North Face jackets, which he saw in Kathmandu. You don't want to climb up into the mountains only to realize your jacket contains synthetic down. If you're planning on trekking up to higher altitudes, be cautious of altitude sickness. Warning signs include vomiting and weakness of the body, says Rajandran. iReporter Udayan Mishra, a Kathmandu resident who has been on several expeditions in Nepal, suggests taking the trek gradually to acclimatize yourself -- overexertion in the beginning may lead to problems later on. Make sure you have enough Nepalese currency before you get on the path. Gakos recalls that there was ""one ATM on the whole trek."" And even if there is an ATM, there's no guarantee that it has been recently stocked with money. There are two typical types of treks: the more popular teahouse trekking and a fully organized camping trip. A teahouse trek gives you the comfort of knowing that lodging and food will be provided. You can carry additional supplies -- clothing, snacks, sleeping bag -- on your own or hire a porter to carry it for you. Once you finish walking, five to six hours on average per day, you settle down in a village. If you don't have a guide to recommend a teahouse, talk to other travelers and consult guidebooks for suggestions. In teahouses that provide lodging and food, guests are expected to eat at least two meals: dinner at night and breakfast the next morning, Gakos says. Don't expect a hotel experience -- expect better. Nepali locals are known for being extremely kind and hospitable. Wenlock says you'll be treated like family during your stay. Gakos was looking for that kind of personal exchange. '""That's why] we picked Annapurna, it was the perfect balance of wilderness and viewing the high Himalayas while also getting the Nepali culture,"" Gakos says. Past visitors consistently praise trekking in Nepal as one of the best experiences of their lives. CNN iReporter Ruth Stewart, who trekked to the Everest Base Camp in winter 2010, says Nepal was the most beautiful part of the world she's ever been to. Take advantage of the majestic mountains and the pristine landscape. Unlike many other mountain ranges, the Himalayan area in Nepal is practically untouched. ""There's no rubbish, there's no gondolas going up to the highest view, there's no cars, there's no traffic -- it's just complete serenity and it's just the most incredible experience,"" Stewart said.","iReporters agree that trekking in Nepal is an incredible experience .

"(CNN) -- An Australian panel on Thursday suggested changes to the country's Constitution to give better recognition to the indigenous population that inhabited the vast continent long before Europeans settled there. The indigenous Australians -- often referred to as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples -- suffered at the hands of the settlers and the government they established. Australian politicians have since apologized for the past mistreatment, but Aborigines remain disadvantaged socially and economically compared with the overall population. Explicit references to Aborigines in the original Constitution, drafted in the late 19th century, were subsequently deemed to be negative. Australians voted overwhelmingly to remove those points in a 1967 referendum, but many people say the document can be further improved to acknowledge the role of the country's indigenous population. The panel -- which included Aboriginal leaders, business executives, legal experts and members of the main political parties -- handed over its report on Thursday to Prime Minister Julia Gillard, whose government has promised to hold a referendum on the matter by the next general election. After spending the past year gathering opinions from people across Australia's huge territory, the panel faced the delicate task of proposing meaningful changes to the Constitution that would receive support from across the political spectrum. Without the backing of all the major political parties, the proposed measures would have little chance of success at a referendum. And rejection by voters could deal a blow to Australia's self-image. ""For many Australians, the failure of a referendum on recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples would result in confusion about the nation's values, commitment to racial nondiscrimination, and sense of national identity,"" the panel said in its report. ""The negative impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples would be profound."" The challenge is highlighted by the track record of past efforts to change the Constitution by vote: only eight of the 44 referendum proposals have passed in Australia's history, with the last successful one in 1974. The panel said it had put forward changes that it thought would be likely to secure broad-based approval from Australians. It proposed repealing two provisions that are still considered to have racist connotations: one that allows states to disqualify people of ""all persons of any race"" from voting at elections; and another that authorizes parliament to make ""special laws"" for ""the people of any race."" That recommendation was expected and had already been supported by the government and the opposition. The panel also made the more politically sensitive suggestion of adding a new section that would give Parliament the power to make laws ""for the peace, order and good government' of Australia ""with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples."" That section would include a passage recognizing that ""the continent and its islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples."" The report also proposed a section prohibiting racial discrimination while still allowing for the possibility of measures to protect and help ""any group."" Some politicians and commentators had expressed concern before Thursday that the panel may put forward new provisions that, if enacted, would give too much power to the courts to interpret the wording as they saw fit. The government said in a statement that it would ""carefully consider the panel's recommendations before determining the best way forward.""","A panel proposes new sections for the Australian Constitution to recognize indigenous people .
The government says it will consider the recommendations before deciding how to proceed .
It has promised a referendum on the issue by the next election .
Changes to the Constitution by referendum rarely do well in Australia ."
"Washington (CNN) -- In a move that could improve security and keep airport lines moving, the Transportation Security Administration early next year will begin testing machines that match a traveler's boarding pass with his or her government-issued ID, while verifying that both documents are authentic. The machines will assist the TSA ""travel document checkers,"" who now conduct checks assisted only by ultraviolet flashlights and magnifying loupes. In 2006, an Indiana University doctoral student created a website allowing people to create fake boarding passes to demonstrate how a known terrorist on the ""No Fly"" list could use a fake boarding pass to get past a checkpoint. Once on the other side, the terrorist could use a real boarding pass acquired under an alias to board a plane. And in June, a Nigerian man was arrested after he flew across the country allegedly with a false boarding pass. Authorities said they found several other phony boarding passes in his luggage. The new technology would authenticate government-issued IDs by comparing written information on the card with information encoded in the ID's bar codes, magnetic strip or computer chip. It would also match the ID to the boarding pass. The system will alert screeners if either document does not pass validation. If the issue is easily rectifiable, such as misspelling of the passenger's name, the TSA may allow the person to proceed. If not immediately resolved, the passenger will be directed to a TSA supervisor. ""This technology will help facilitate risk-based security, while making the process more effective and efficient,"" TSA Administrator John S. Pistole said. The TSA has awarded contracts of $79 million each to three companies: BAE Systems Information Solutions, NCR Government Systems and Trans Digital Technologies, LLC. Each company will provide 10 machines for testing at U.S. airports. The TSA has not disclosed which airports will get the machines. In August, the TSA's chief privacy officer issued a report saying the machines have minimal privacy implications because only a limited amount of personal information is collected by the machines and because this information ""is deleted after use."" A TSA spokeswoman said earlier versions of the technology were tested at two Washington-area airports in 2009.","The TSA will test machines that match a boarding pass with the passenger's ID .

"(CNN) -- It all sounds eerily familiar. A new iPhone. Massive sales. Then, an apparent glitch that, while it doesn't affect everyone, is prevalent enough to irk customers and catch the eyes of tech journalists everywhere. Poor battery life on the iPhone 4S, released on October 14 to great fanfare and record sales, has been the new model's Achilles' heel in the minds of many users. While complaints about the perceived problem haven't reached the fevered pitch that last year's iPhone 4 release saw about its so-called ""death grip"" problem, they don't seem to be going away. There were, of course, the expected number of early-adopter quibbles with the phone: from troubles with new carrier Sprint, to a sometimes slow-moving camera, to limits on the voice-activated Siri ""personal assistant"" outside the United States. But as most of those gripes either got sorted or users got used to the limitations, complaints about the phone's battery life have persisted. A post on the Apple support forums, begun on October 15 to discuss battery problems, was still active Tuesday -- two weeks and 185 pages worth of comments later. ""I purchased what I thought was a top-of-the-line product only to be terribly disappointed,"" one user wrote Tuesday. ""This is my first iPhone and may well be my last."" Battery life was a frequent complaint about the iPhone 3GS, but concerns about the phone's short battery life seemed to have been addressed on the next-generation iPhone 4. According to Apple's official specs, the iPhone 4S should have enough juice in the battery for up to eight hours of talk time, six hours of Internet surfing, 10 hours of video viewing and 200 hours on standby. (All activities on a 3G connection -- 2G and wireless have different figures). All of those numbers are within an hour or so of the iPhone 4, except for one. The older phone's specifications promise 300 hours of standby power: a full 50% more than the 4S. Users complaining on the Apple forum and elsewhere say that their phones aren't lasting anywhere near even that reduced length of time. Various independent tests of the new phone have suggested that some phones have problems with poor battery life, while others don't. The general consensus among tech-inclined owners is that the problem may not lie with the battery itself, but with the way the phone utilizes Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 5. Specifically, the theory goes, its location-based services are a power drain. If the phone is constantly trying to pinpoint where it is, it will suck power even when the user isn't actively doing something with the phone. (For a comparison, think about how quickly your battery drains when you forget to turn off Wi-Fi searches while you're driving.) The new phone also has a more powerful processor -- the same one that's in the iPad 2. That could cut battery life, even though Apple CEO Tim Cook specifically said that it wouldn't during the iPhone 4S unveiling event last month. Apparently, reading from the well-worn Apple playbook, the company has not commented publicly about the battery complaints. Messages and e-mails to Apple seeking comment on these complaints were not returned. It's unclear whether the company acknowledges there's a battery problem (although there have been reports that Apple is contacting iPhone 4S users to try to get to the bottom of it). And while it's too early for direct comparisons, the extended silence looks remarkably like the public-relations two-step that was Apple's handling of the iPhone 4's antenna issues. (As you may recall, Consumer Reports and others said the iPhone 4 had antenna problems that caused it to drop calls. People dubbed the situation ""Antennagate."") First, the company refused to publicly acknowledge the issue. Then, there was a software patch apparently aimed at fixing it (although Apple never explicitly said so). There would eventually be a news conference in which then-CEO Steve Jobs spent most of the time denying there was any real problem, then announcing that the company would give away free bumpers -- minimalist iPhone cases -- to prevent dropped calls. But before that, there were the private e-mails and public statements saying, in essence, that users were holding their phones wrong. Then, weeks after the free-bumper news conference, Jobs and others doubled back, saying that there was never really much of a problem and discontinuing the freebie program. As Apple's silence persists (the company has said in the past that it spends time researching potential problems before addressing them publicly), users and observers are complaining and speculating in the vacuum. And that's not always pretty. ""It hits you when you least expect it. It slips away under a mask of dormant inactivity. And it can ruin your entire day,"" TechCrunch's Jordan Crook wrote Tuesday. ""It's your iPhone 4S battery life, and it sucks.""","Complaints about iPhone 4S battery life mount .
Some iPhone owners say their batteries drain much faster than advertised .
Apple has not publicly acknowledged the concerns .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Nearly four years after she was arrested on suspicion of having killed her roommate in this picturesque Italian university town, Amanda Knox pleaded with a jury Monday to overturn her conviction for murder. ""I am not what they say I am. I did not kill. I did not rape. I did not steal,"" Amanda Knox said, her voice trembling with emotion. She was making perhaps the most important speech of her life, and it showed. She got out only a few words before her voice choked off, she stopped, and said under her breath: ""OK."" Then she launched into the crux of her plea: . ""People always ask 'who is Amanda Knox?' I am the same person that I was four years ago, exactly the same person. The only thing that now separates me from four years ago is my suffering. ""In four years, I've lost my friends in the most terrible and unexplainable way. My trust in the authorities and the police has been damaged. I had to face charges that were totally unfair, without any basis. And I am paying with my life for something I haven't done,"" she said, speaking fluent, flawless Italian. Knox and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito are fighting to be acquitted of the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher. Prosecutors have called for the pair's sentences -- of 26 and 25 years, respectively -- to be increased to life. Kercher's family, meanwhile, held out hope that the conviction would remain in place. ""It isn't just the DNA or on one specific thing,"" Meredith's mother, Arline Kercher, said when the family spoke to members of the media. ""It's the overall evidence."" Meredith's sister Stephanie said the family remains ""satisfied"" with Knox's conviction and believes it was right, short of someone else coming along and saying, ""I did it."" ""I think Meredith has been hugely forgotten in all of this,"" Stephanie Kercher said, adding that the family wants ""truth"" and ""justice"" for Meredith. The Kercher family spoke calmly as they -- and millions around the world, gripped by this case -- awaited word from the jury. Earlier, before Knox spoke in court, Sollecito made a dramatic appeal to the court to free the two of them. He removed a white plastic bracelet from his wrist and fingered it nervously as his closing statement came to an end. ""It says 'Free Amanda and Raffaele,'"" he said. ""I have never taken it off. ... I think now is the moment to take it off."" His voice fading almost to inaudibility, he concluded, ""I hope this is part of history and that Amanda and I have a future."" ""I have never hurt anybody,"" he said. Knox did not look at Sollecito as he addressed the court, though he detailed for the judges and jurors the night of Kercher's murder. The couple have maintained they were together at Sollecito's residence the night Kercher was killed. He described the night as a happy, almost idyllic one for him: ""I was about to hand in my thesis. I had just met Amanda, a beautiful, sunny girl."" The case is now in the hands of two judges and six jurors, who retired together within minutes of Knox's statement to consider their ruling. As they deliberated Monday morning, Rocco Girlanda, a member of the Italian Parliament, said Knox was calm. ""She is playing and singing songs in the chapel. ... She is calm, very, very calm. She says, 'Unfortunately I have some terrible hours ahead of me, because I have to wait,' "" said Girlanda, who has become an advocate for Knox. But the lawmaker said Knox was hopeful. ""She is absolutely convinced she will fly home to the U.S. tonight,"" he said. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder, sexual assault and related crimes in December 2009. Their appeal has focused largely on DNA evidence found on a knife and on a bra clasp belonging to the victim. Knox's words capped a dramatic week of closing arguments by the host of lawyers battling over the outcome, from the lawyer for a man falsely accused of the crime, who called Knox ""Lucifer-like, demonic, Satanic,"" to the Sollecito defense counsel Giulia Bongiorno, who insisted that like the buxom cartoon temptress Jessica Rabbit in the movie ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Knox is not bad, just ""drawn that way."" Knox told the court she always wanted justice for Kercher, her roommate at the university. ""I am innocent. Raffaele is innocent,"" she said. At the conclusion of her statement, Knox put her hands on her face and wept, burying her face in the shoulder of defense lawyer Carlo dalla Vedova, who put a comforting arm around her and offered her a handkerchief. Knox was 20 and Kercher was 21 years old, studying at Perugia's university for foreign students, when Kercher's semi-naked body was found in the house they shared. Her throat had been slashed. Sollecito, 23 at the time, was Knox's boyfriend, studying computer science at another university in Perugia. Prosecutors and police say Kercher's genetic material was on the knife blade and Knox's was on the handle, and that a Kercher bra clasp found at the crime scene had Sollecito's DNA. Defense lawyers and independent experts argued strenuously during the appeal that the DNA testing process was badly flawed and the results should be inadmissible. As Knox defense lawyer Luciano Ghirga made his final statements to the court before Knox and Sollecito spoke Monday, he reminded the jury that the standard is ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" ""We ask you to give complete freedom to Amanda Knox,"" he said. Knox has addressed this jury at least twice before, telling them in June she was ""shocked"" by the testimony of the third person convicted of the crime, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast. Guede admitted having sexual relations with Kercher but denied killing her. Guede was sentenced separately to 30 years behind bars for the murder, a sentence that was reduced to 16 on appeal. In June, he refused to tell the court hearing Knox and Sollecito's appeal that they had not been involved. A prosecutor then read a letter Guede had written to a newspaper from prison, saying he thought they had killed Kercher. ""The only time Rudy Guede, Raffaele Sollecito and I were in one room together was in a courtroom,"" Knox told the court in June. Her defense dismissed Guede's letter as based on ""a feeling,"" not facts or events he witnessed. Before the hearing began Monday, Knox's stepfather told CNN he was optimistic about the outcome of the appeal. He made his way into the court through a throng of reporters, ignoring shouted questions from journalists. Either side can appeal this court's ruling to Italy's High Court, but such an appeal would be on narrow technical grounds only. CNN's Hada Messia, Matthew Chance, Paula Newton and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","It isn't just the DNA,"" Kercher's mother says .

"(CNN) -- If Herman Cain committed sexual harassment and is now lying about it, his goose is cooked and it should be. But if he is telling the truth, there is something terribly disconcerting about the way the Washington ""scandal industrial complex"" -- full of reporters, former campaign workers and pundits -- has reacted to this sad story. After the story broke in Politico, Cain the next day denied that he sexually harassed anyone, which after all, is the core issue. Since then, other anonymous sources claim they too were harassed, without anyone really knowing what the alleged harassment entailed. He has been consistent, unwavering and on the record in his denial. But that's not good enough for the way things work in Washington, where the manner in which he reacted to the news is said to be a sign of whether he would make a good president. He is being assailed because he remembered more information and therefore ""his story changed,"" an unforgivable development for those who cover scandal news. Journalists trotted out their well-worn formula for keeping a scandal story alive by saying that his ""answers led to more unanswered questions,"" even though he already answered the only question that matters -- did he harass anyone? Experts who know scandals decry his failure to have ""gotten ahead of the story."" He should have seen this coming, they say, and pre-empted it, the way all clever Washington politicians, skilled in the art of survival, would have done. My problem with this line of attack is it's exactly what has made politicians, and often the reporters who cover them, so disconnected from the rest of the country. Cain's reaction has been human. It's been just the opposite of what a politician who prizes political survival above all would have done. Imagine that you were accused of doing something you did not do 12 years ago. You have a staff and your staff figured out a way to make it go away. Good, you might say. I didn't do it and it deserves to go away. You then put the issue out of your mind. Then 12 years later, the allegations re-emerge. It's not unnatural that you start to remember more facts. Some details come back to you. Some don't. That's the way the human mind works. It's not the way political minds work. In a year in which people of all parties are fed up with how Washington conducts its business, it's ironic that Cain is now being assailed by Washington insiders for his failure to act like a Washington insider. I know all the tricks of the trade. If Cain spent 21 years in Washington like I did, he would have pre-empted the issue by giving a speech about what it takes to make it in business. As he cited his successes, he could have addressed how hard it can sometimes be to make it in America today. How innocent statements he once made to his staff led to threatened lawsuits. How despite his knowing he did nothing wrong, he was advised to ""settle"" the matter so it didn't become a bigger distraction. What's $35,000 to a multimillion dollar industry? Trial lawyers, excess regulations, union demands all make it so hard to create jobs and achieve growth. He could have gotten the news out himself, framed in a way that minimized the ""scandal"" and maximized his themes about the economy. How very Washington, and clever, that would have been. If Cain was the same type of skilled politician who has made Washington what it is has largely become -- an assemblage of smooth-talking, gifted experts in creating a massive debt that risks our future, while being seemingly incapable of doing anything about it other than blaming the other guy -- he might have acted differently. But he's not an insider. He said what came naturally. He remembered more facts -- a very human development -- and said them. Scandal experts will tell you not to remember more information. Stick to your denial and say nothing else, they would advise. Cain didn't do that because he's not like that. He genuinely is different. And because he's different, he's being pilloried for how he has handled the allegations. Before these anonymous allegations hit, I publicly said, and I repeat, I like the fact that Cain is an outsider, but I don't think he's ready for the Oval Office. I wanted someone who thinks like an outsider but who has also served as a governor (think Indiana's Mitch Daniels) so he or she has the knowledge and experience to get programs through Congress. I'm neutral in this primary. But as well-versed as I am in the ways of Washington, I'm the first to admit that the ways of Washington are a big part of the problem. The public is yearning for someone who is genuine and who doesn't act like a perfect politician. Unfortunately, the scandal industrial complex does its business the Washington way, judging Cain's reaction according to formulas that were written by perfect politicians. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ari Fleischer.","Herman Cain has repeatedly denied sexually harassing women .

"(CNN) -- Jeanne Tripplehorn's movie is about women and breast cancer. And it's airing on Lifetime. Uh oh, this could get weepy. Tripplehorn, who has starred in cable show ""Big Love,"" knows how preachy and awkward cancer movies can get. ""This was something different,"" she said, of the film ,which airs Monday at 9 p.m. ""I spoke with Lifetime and they wanted it to be a new approach and a new way of looking at cancer."" The actress has seen the disease's toll. ""Like all women, I had been affected,"" she said. ""Women in my family dealt with breast cancer. They all survived. It was important for me to do this on a lot of different levels. It wasn't just a paycheck."" The movie, ""Five"" tells stories of different women coping with breast cancer in five vignettes. Tripplehorn's character, an oncologist is the tie that binds the five stories together. Her character loses her mother to breast cancer as a young girl and becomes an oncologist. The project has a bevy of star power. The executive producers are Jennifer Aniston, Marta Kauffman, co-creator of the series ""Friends"" and Kristin Hahn, who was the executive producer of ""The Departed."" Aniston, Demi Moore and Alicia Keys each directed one of the vignettes. The ensemble cast includes Patricia Clarkson, Rosario Dawson, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Holloway, Tracee Ellis Ross, Tony Shalhoub and Jeffrey Tambor. Tripplehorn answered a few questions for CNN not long ago. CNN: Did you work with an oncologist, or consult a doctor for your role? Tripplehorn: I consulted an oncologist. I read a lot. The thing that I found confusing and frustrating is once you have this diagnosis, there is this maze of doctors. There wasn't one particular way of dealing with a diagnosis. I was just very confused to the journey that one takes after a diagnosis. You have your mammogram, your radiologist, your oncologist. Jen [Aniston] and her producing partner Kristin [Hahn] toured a clinic that hopefully will become a model for clinics across the country. It's almost a one-stop shop with everything a woman needs - the doctors, radiologists. It's all under one roof. And hopefully that will simplify before we get a cure. CNN: What resonated with you about the story? Tripplehorn: Just the way they were telling the story -- the five short films dealing with different women with the diagnoses. I thought it was an interesting way of telling stories. Five directors who are women, for me, personally, it was a great experience to work with each of these directors. Alicia Keys is a first time director. You would never know it when you see her film. CNN: Did having family members who've had breast cancer influence you in taking part in this project? Tripplehorn: I had two women on my mother's side of the family; both went through bouts of breast cancer. Both survived. My grandmother was a two-time survivor of breast cancer. She passed away of something different 15 years after her last diagnosis. It's close to my heart and experience. CNN: Having family members who've had this disease, does it make you concerned about your risk? Tripplehorn: It's a constant reminder. It's always in the news. It's always out there. So, it's just what you live with. It's what you face. You try to watch your diet, you're constantly aware of it. Some people put their head in the sand and I'm not that kind of person. I'm very aware of it. CNN: Your character in the movie gets genetic testing for breast cancer. Have you ever thought about it? Tripplehorn: I think it's a personal thing. It's not something that I'm thinking of doing. It's very personal. CNN: What's your message through this movie? Tripplehorn: No woman should have to go through this. I've seen it up close and personal. The fact that we're airing this during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, it's a small part that I could do -- if I could raise awareness, if women see this and get a mammogram. When I started this project, it had been two years since I got a mammogram, because I was so busy. That's what happens with women. They are so busy taking care of other people, they don't put themselves first. You have to go out and do these small things. Getting a mammogram, doing your monthly self-exam, your diet, just taking care of yourself. If this film will remind women out there to do just that, that's a step in the right direction. It's not every project that you can do this -- that can possibly directly impact somebody's life. And that was my hope.","Jeanne Tripplehorn knows how preachy and awkward cancer movies can get .

"(CNN) -- When I became one of Bill Clinton's earliest and chief accusers for the sexual harassment charges against him, two things were eminently true about my motives: (a) I did not become an accuser because Bill Clinton was a Democrat and I was a Republican, I didn't care one whit what the partisan fallout would be; and (b) I spoke out because the charges were plentiful enough and serious enough (I repeat, charges, not facts) to degrade not only all of our politics but all of our country, and because there are certain codes of honor, written and unwritten, for all men, Democrat and Republican. Indeed I wrote a book on this, laying it out, even before we knew the full extent of Bill Clinton's lies. It is hypocritical in the extreme for those members of the media who didn't take the charges and allegations against Bill Clinton seriously to be taking the allegations against Herman Cain that we now have as seriously as they are. Hypocritical is probably too soft a word, frankly. That said, Herman Cain and his campaign chief of staff, Mark Block, cannot go on as they have. There has been a pattern now that is both unhealthy for our politics and unhealthy for our polity. Four women are not an insignificant number. One or two anonymous charges, perhaps. Three anonymous charges (where, as I understand the story, Cain knows of at least two of the women) plus one woman who went very public and opened herself up to all manner of investigation are a lot. It is no longer insignificant. Neither is it insignificant that the Cain campaign discounted the charges in the initial stories, saying they were based on anonymous sources, only to make a mockery by blaming other campaigns with less substantiation than the original stories. If Herman Cain wants to be taken seriously as a public advocate for anything, never mind running for the chief executive and commander in chief of the most powerful and important and blessed country in the world, he needs to give a full press conference dedicated exclusively to this issue and these allegations. I have watched long enough and held my tongue long enough to give him the benefit of the doubt, but can no longer say this is a witch hunt, ""a lynching"" to use his word, or any other euphemism. There are allegations out there that matter and they have stacked up. For we who led the charge against Bill Clinton on a number of related issues to continue to blame the media or other campaigns or say it simply doesn't matter makes us the hypocrites as well. As I say, all of this is bad for our politics and polity. If Herman Cain cannot stand up to these charges, if he refuses to, then he should step out of the race. A man big enough to run for president should be big enough to have a full and candid press conference on all of this -- he wants us to elect him president after all, he's asking us to trust our lives and the country's life to him. This could be one of his finest moments and it could be one of his worst. But either way, he must confront the moment candidly and manfully. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Herman Cain should confront allegations of sexual harassment .

"(CNN) -- They distrust government and the justice system as well as Europe's political elite. They rail against multiculturalism and believe their national identity is being swamped by immigration and their culture strangled by Islam. They are implacably hostile to ""big money"" -- banks and other financial institutions. They are getting organized, online and off, and thriving amid Europe's eurozone crisis. ""They"" are populist groups and parties from Scandinavia to Hungary. Some compete in elections with growing success, picking up protest votes that yield seats in government and the European Parliament. Others are street movements like the English Defense League and Bloc Identitaire in France that eschew the political process. But they have one thing in common: a growing following through social media. A new survey by the think tank Demos found that 14 prominent populist movements in Europe had 436,000 Facebook followers between them -- with the far-right British National Party and the Austrian Freedom Party each having more than 80,000. Of those followers, 32% were younger than 21. Demos asked supporters of these populist groups on Facebook to respond to a survey -- and more than 12,000 did. The survey found the supporters were predominantly young men, more likely to take part in protests than other groups and highly disillusioned with mainstream politics. Only 20% of these online supporters trusted their national governments. And the vast majority listed immigration and Islamic extremism as their greatest concerns. Significantly, while a majority of those surveyed disavowed violence, 26% regarded it as ""acceptable to achieve the right outcome."" Among followers of Bloc Identitaire in France and CasaPound Italia in Italy, the proportion rose to well over 40%. CasaPound is named after American poet Ezra Pound, who supported dictator Benito Mussolini, and its leader told the Guardian newspaper this week that the fascist leader was the group's ""point of reference."" Several supporters of Bloc Identitaire last month staged a ""white die-in"" on the streets of Dijon as a protest against perceived inaction by the authorities after the murder of a white teenager. This mind-set has already led to a violent response among a tiny minority, as the Norway massacre earlier this year -- and admitted to by suspect Anders Breivik -- showed. Breivik purportedly authored a 1,500-page manifesto critical of Muslim immigration and European liberalism. The sort of grievances that motivated Breivik are echoed throughout the Demos survey. One supporter of the English Defense League wrote: ""No way can a Muslim race bring their rules to our country."" Another respondent identifying himself as a supporter of the Dansk Folkeparti, which has 25 seats in the Danish parliament, reflected a view widely held among respondents: ""The foreigners are slowly suffocating our lovely country. They have all these children and raise them so badly that in three or four generations there'll be no ... well-behaved children at all."" A supporter of the German group Die Freiheit said his priorities were ""human rights...against Islamisation of Europe and intolerance by Turkish and Arabic immigrants towards gays and Jews,"" an unusual twist on the traditional phobias of the far right. By country, supporters of the French National Front and Bloc Identitaire were the most concerned about immigration, while followers of the Dutch Freedom Party were the most likely to rate Islamic extremism among their top concerns. The party, part of the current coalition government in the Netherlands, is led by Geert Wilders, who has described Islam as a 'fascist' religion. While some respondents were openly racist, others were more concerned that Muslim immigrants avoided assimilation. ""Prevent the oppression of Islamic women,"" wrote one Swedish respondent, ""by banning the burqa in public places."" Many respondents share a loathing of what they see as a corrupt and complacent political class. A Facebook follower of the French National Front lamented ""the desperate lies of the MPs, the comfortable way in which they live while the French face a multitude of problems such as insecurity, mass immigration..."" A supporter of the Northern League in Italy, which has a significant presence in the national and regional assemblies, commented ""I hate politicians; they are all disgusting, especially when they get to the armchair of power."" This sentiment feeds into a gloomy assessment of Europe's future among followers of these populist movements. Asked whether their country was on the right track, supporters of French, British, German and Belgian groups were the most downbeat, with fewer than 10% optimistic about the future. Increasingly, the sentiment appears to be feeding growing hostility toward the European Union. Large majorities of supporters in all but one group (the exception being the Northern League in Italy) regard the EU as a waste of money, with inadequate control over its external borders, and hold it responsible for a loss of cultural identity. Demos says the survey shows how the convergence of virtual and real-world political activity ""is the way millions of people -- especially young people -- relate to politics in the 21st century."" The challenge to European politicians, as they lurch from one crisis summit to the next, is to ensure this alienated generation does not desert civic society altogether.","Populist movements in Europe have a large online following .

"(CNN) -- Syrian activists say opposition forces have wrested control of the town of Zabadani from government troops, but the authorities' tanks remain perched on its outskirts. ""There was massive protests in Zabadani, so the Syrian Army tried to disperse them. But our troops were very organized and aggressive with a counter attack that left them fleeing and they withdrew completely out of the city,"" said Lt. Col. Mohamed Hamdo of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a group made up of former government soldiers. ""Our forces raised the flag of independence in Zabadani."" Hamdo said, though, that the opposition fighters ""expect another confrontation"" as the government forces regroup outside the town. The FSA destroyed at least three armored vehicles during the fighting, a Zabadani-based member of the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition umbrella group, told CNN. Cold weather and snow hindered troop movements into the town, located at the head of a mountain valley, said the activist, who identified himself only as Faris. Faris said Zabadani residents aided the rebel force by providing them with clothing and shelter. No civilians were killed there on Wednesday, he added. Jordan's king: Don't expect change soon . Another activist in Zabadani told CNN that Syrian government forces had ringed the town and were shelling it from outside. And a third activist, based in the northern city of Homs, told CNN that about 6,000 people in Zabadani turned out for a demonstration to celebrate Wednesday evening. Video posted on YouTube showed marchers clapping and chanting, waving their fingers in the air in victory signs and voicing thanks to the Free Syrian Army. Syrian authorities have restricted the activity of journalists during the 10-month uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, so CNN cannot independently verify events there. But a CNN crew accompanied an Arab League monitoring team during a visit to Zabadani on Sunday, when crowds carried the monitors on their shoulders and urged them to stay to prevent reprisals. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency made no mention Wednesday of events in Zabadani. Elsewhere, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said 21 more people were killed by government troops on Wednesday. Of those, 13 were killed in Homs, the scene of the worst violence in recent weeks, with the rest scattered around the country, the LCC said. Four people were killed in Idlib, two in the Damascus suburbs, one in Aleppo and one in Daraa, according to the LCC. The Syrian Arab News Agency, meanwhile, said 15 police officers and soldiers, including an army colonel, had been killed in recent fighting. EU plans new sanctions against Syrian regime .

"(CNN) -- In the midst of a swirl of rumors about Herman Cain, a woman who accuses him of sexual harassment holds a news conference. Her attorney, Gloria Allred, employs her studied grimace as Sharon Bialek tells of an encounter 14 years ago that, if true, constitutes an unreported sexual assault. At his own press conference the next day, candidate Cain issues a heated denial, having earlier hinted at a willingness to take a lie detector test. How would the court system, America's formal arbiter of truth, evaluate the competing claims? The courts would refuse to even consider them. In the legal world, courts scrupulously enforce statutes of limitations on accusations of improper or criminal conduct. The rules exist because it is unfair to force the accused to defend against a charge of ancient vintage. Witness memories and evidence have grown stale and the courts believe that evidence is best evaluated and most reliable when it is fresh. The rare exceptions to this rule almost always involve the abuse of children and particularly heinous crimes like murder. The law provides no sanctuary for women who seek to resurrect sexual harassment claims from as distant as 14 years in the past. But Herman Cain now exists in the realm of politics and not the courtroom. Cain must find a way to prove his innocence to a skeptical public regarding a suspiciously large number of claims for which the statute of limitations has long since expired. Unfortunately, finding a path to the truth of sex harassment charges can often be a perilous journey. Today, most professionals structure their interactions with employees of the opposite sex carefully to avoid even the hint of sexual impropriety. Glass-walled office suites are the norm, insuring that employee relationships remain open to public view. The world of ""Mad Men's"" Don Draper and his blatantly sexual overtures to female employees is mostly a thing of the past. Today's sexual harassment is far more subtle. Although legitimate claims deserve compensation, the sex harassment litigation story has a seedy underside. False complaints are sometimes rewarded with generous monetary awards and then hidden from public view with confidentiality agreements and sealing orders. Employment lawyers are accustomed to meeting with CEO clients who are initially defiant and determined to resist a false claim of sexual harassment. They want their reputations and integrity preserved. But when a high-ranking executive is involved, the company rumor vine begins to grow. Depositions are taken. Employees are pulled out of the workplace to back one side or the other. Sterling reputations begin to bleed under the slash of a thousand paper cuts. And of course, the litigation process is expensive for the company. Knowing this, experienced lawyers often urge even the innocent accused executive to agree to mediate claims informally and avoid the possibility of a very public and very embarrassing federal lawsuit. Legitimate victims are also urged to settle rather than risk losing at trial. Once mediation begins, the parties are told that public humiliation and legal costs can be avoided with a quiet, confidential settlement. Both plaintiff and defendant are simultaneously silenced by the agreement's penalty provisions. The truth of the claims will never be tested in any public forum. That is, unless the accused decides to run for public office. Then it appears the art of the leak can undermine the solidity of even the most carefully drafted of confidentiality agreements. Herman Cain said he never consented to the mediation process. The National Restaurant Association, through its board, might have negotiated its own deal with the two women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Cain to avoid bad publicity and legal costs. Businesses will often ""settle and seal"" the case rather than endure the expense and embarrassment of defending even a falsely accused chief executive. Based on the sketchy reported accounts, the initial case against Cain might have been paper-thin. There is no assertion of overt sexual contact between him and the female employees in question. The website Politico, which broke the story, refers to witness accounts of episodes of conversations filled with ""innuendo"" and of ""physical gestures that were not overtly sexual"" but which made female employees feel uncomfortable. No one who has followed Cain's astonishingly successful presidential campaign would be surprised to hear that he uses blunt language and gestures to express himself. The question of whether this blunt language constituted true sexual harassment may never be known. The claimant represented by attorney Joel Bennett, and recently identified as a federal government employee, has refused to go public despite the National Restaurant Association's highly unusual decision to release her from the negotiated confidentiality agreement. The second and third women remain anonymous, while Bialek surfaces with very old, never formally reported claims. In a court of law, Cain would clearly win. But in this case we are not litigating a claim but selecting a president. The American public, exercising its common sense about the character and integrity of this presidential candidate, will be the only and final judge of the facts of this case. Given the secrecy of the sex harassment litigation process and the grave difficulty in determining the truth of old and moldy claims, it looks like a hung jury is the likely outcome. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Callan.","Paul Callan: The women accusing Cain relate encounters from years ago .
The courts wouldn't hear these cases because of statute of limitations, he writes .

"London (CNN) -- Following a year in which ""people power"" was the rallying cry from the Arab Spring to the Occupy movement, the annual World Economic Forum might seem an elitist anomaly. Never mind the 1%, this is the 0.00004%: around 2,600 of the world's top political and business leaders, coming together to address the big issues -- most pressingly, the eurozone debt crisis -- in the luxurious surrounds of a Swiss ski resort. Among those gathering in Europe's highest-altitude town from January 25 to 29 will be royalty from Saudi Arabia, Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands, billionaires like philanthropist George Soros, senior executives from Facebook, Google and other tech giants, and the leaders of countries including Germany, South Africa, Mexico, and the world's youngest nation, South Sudan. While admission is free for heads of state, civil society or faith leaders and international organizations, among others, those paying will face a $20,000 price tag for admission, plus other costs which can easily push the bill to $40,000. But the true barrier to entry is having the power and influence to secure a ""white badge"" of invitation, the only means of admission to this most exclusive of clubs. As undemocratic as the event may seem, the forum's architects say that the current global atmosphere of unrest will give discussions an even greater significance. This year's theme is ""The great transformation: shaping new models."" Klaus Schwab, the German economist who founded the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 1971, says new decision-making models are needed to account for changed global realities. The WEF has cautioned that the backlash against rising inequality, seen in the discontent behind the Occupy movement and the Arab Spring, risks derailing globalization and constitutes a threat to economies worldwide. Amidst the turmoil of the current economic environment, emphasis needs to be placed on finding new models for assessing the quality of economic growth -- ensuring it is both sustainable and inclusive. Given rising youth unemployment -- in Spain, Europe's worst affected country, joblessness among young people stands at about 45% -- a new model for job creation is also needed. ""For the first time in generations, many people no longer believe that their children will grow up to enjoy a higher standard of living than theirs,"" said Lee Howell, the WEF managing director behind the Forum's Global Risks 2012 report. The key to avoiding catastrophe, Schwab argues in a discussion paper, is ""to provide young people with the capability to create their own jobs: to move from the pure concept of unemployment to the concept of micro-entrepreneurship."" Those who dismiss the forum as an ineffectual talk-fest for the wealthy and privileged may point to the thematic similarities with previous years' forums as evidence that the event does little to actually implement change towards its stated ends. It's certainly true that the problems that have given a more austere tone to proceedings in recent years have only endured, or worsened, since the world's elite last visited Davos. At least this year's discussions will not want for a sense of urgency. Delegates will meet against the backdrop of the eurozone debt crisis, with European nations bickering over the fiscal compact they hope will be their salvation. But ahead of the EU summit which immediately follows Davos on January 30, the situation remains bleak. France and Austria recently lost their prized AAA credit ratings in a downgrade by Standard & Poor's which affected seven other eurozone nations. Budget deficit numbers for Greece, the country which triggered the current crisis, are getting worse, while crucial talks between the country's government and its creditors on debt haircuts have struck difficulties. The world's largest economy suffered the same indignity as France when, in an unprecedented move, the U.S.was stripped of AAA status in August. This followed of months of uncertainty stemming from the political paralysis over raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, the resolution of which meant the country narrowly avoided a potentially calamitous default. And, a year on from its outbreak, the failure of the Arab Spring to deliver dividends has some questioning whether it really constitutes a new dawn. In Egypt, unemployment is at a decade-long high, tourism is down by a quarter, the Cairo Stock Exchange was 2011's worst performer and the once celebrated military has been recast as a villain. The success of Islamist parties on the new political landscape of the Middle East has disappointed some secularists and liberals, and raised concerns about the social changes that could ensue. For those in attendance, Davos will provide an opportunity not just to air opinions, but perhaps also to build a consensus on how to approach these new realities. The real action will be conducted behind the scenes, at exclusive cocktail parties and black-tie events in the town's most expensive hotels. Eventually though, from the muted hum of discussions, a better sense of the global agenda for the year ahead will emerge, even for those of us without white badges.","The world's elite will converge on Davos with the eurozone crisis at the forefront of discussions .

"(EW.com) -- ""Real Steel"" showed what it was made of, as the robot-boxing action drama won the weekend with an estimated $27.3 million. That's the strongest opening ever for a boxing-themed picture, beating ""Rocky IV""'s $20 million debut in 1985 (when not adjusting for inflation). DreamWorks' $110 million film, which was released by Disney's Touchstone Pictures, scored a superb ""A"" rating from CinemaScore graders. That bodes well for the movie's box-office stamina, especially since there are no other major family films hitting theaters until ""Puss in Boots"" pounces on October 28. Unsurprisingly for a movie about mechanical fighters beating up one another, ""Real Steel"" skewed male -- 66 percent of the audience according to Disney. It also attracted a younger crowd, with 44 percent under the age of 25. The PG-13 movie's respectable opening must also come as a relief to star Hugh Jackman, who hasn't had a non-X-Men film open to more than $20 million since 2004â€²s ""Van Helsing."" In second with $10.4 million was the political thriller ""The Ides of March."" The R-rated film -- which George Clooney directed, co-wrote, and co-stars in along with Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood, and Marisa Tomei -- particularly appealed to older women. According to Sony, 58 percent of the audience was female and 60 percent was over the age of 35. The $12.5 million movie earned a ""B"" grade from CinemaScore participants, which is a bit lower than expected considering its awards buzz and positive reviews. ""The Ides of March"" will need to hold up well the next few weeks if it wants to keep its Oscar hopes alive. The rest of the top five consisted of prior releases that all dropped around (a very commendable) 35 percent from last week. In third place, the family film ""Dolphin Tale"" slipped 34 percent for $9.2 million, pushing the film's cumulative tally to $49.1 million. The Brad Pitt baseball drama ""Moneyball,"" a critical darling, grossed $7.5 million for a 38 percent decline. And the well-reviewed cancer comedy ""50/50,"" starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen, fell 36 percent for $5.5 million. In limited release, the why-does-this-movie-exist horror sequel ""The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence"" stitched together a decent $54,000 from 18 theaters, with most locations only offering late-night showings. 1.

"(CNN) -- My favorite part of academic debate has always been the cross-examination period. We got a little piece of that (but not enough) in the Republican presidential debate Tuesday hosted by Bloomberg and the Washington Post. The presidential hopefuls were allowed to ask an opponent one question. Mitt Romney faced seven opponents, and four of them directed their questions at him because he is seen as the frontrunner. While this can be a good idea in theory to try and trip up the frontrunner, it actually helped Romney. The only two people to get significant air time in the first hour were Romney and Herman Cain. So by asking Romney more questions, the other candidates gave him even more time to present his case to the public. The strategy of the other candidates might have worked if he was on the ropes or was stumbling in the debate, but Romney had not given his opponents any obvious openings. In his answers to the four questions from his opponents, Romney did well. His answer to Newt Gingrich's question was one of Romney's strongest moments of the debate when he highlighted how his economic plan would help the middle class. He underscored that the middle class has been hit the hardest by the economic downturn, so any presidential candidate should begin by focusing on helping them. Herman Cain is pretty clever in these exchanges. You can tell he has a few lines that are well rehearsed. In fact, when it was his turn to ask a question, I actually thought he might try to ask himself the question. That way he could insert 9-9-9 into both a question and an answer (which would be a feat even for him). Instead he asked Romney if he could list off all 59 points of his plan. This question was designed to showcase the simplicity of Cain's plan in comparison. The question was effective enough, but might have backfired when Romney used it to his advantage to say that simple answers are oftentimes inadequate. Romney took a unique approach. His question was directed at Michele Bachmann. On its face, it seems like a puzzling approach, but I actually like the strategy. It gave air time to someone Romney does not think will be a factor, thereby taking time away from his main rivals. Plus, he simply asked Bachmann how she could help the economy by putting people to work, which guided her answer away from attacking Romney in her free time. It was a smart choice. Three of the candidates used their questions to also make solid points. Ron Paul asked Cain about his time spent chairing a Federal Reserve Bank, which is a negative with Paul. Paul's question made the argument that he was correct all along about not trusting the Federal Reserve. Michele Bachmann used her question to attack Rick Perry and remind everyone that she has always been a conservative while Perry used to be a Democrat working for Al Gore. Rick Santorum also asked Cain a question that made an argument. As part of his question, he attacked the 9-9-9 plan by asking the audience who wanted to pay a 9% sales tax. Santorum then asked the audience if they believed the federal government would stick to a 9% income tax. He used their silence to question and attack Cain. Share your view on the debate . Rick Perry doesn't seem to get any part of these debates right, and that included the section where he was allowed to ask any other candidate a question. Perry asked Romney a question about health care, but he failed to have depth in his question or attack. Perry failed to make a positive point about his own health care policy and forgot that in answering the question, Romney would get to freely blast away at the lack of health care for children in Perry's home state of Texas. This was a perfect example of the person answering the questions turning it against the questioner. As is becoming a trend in these debates, Perry came out on the wrong end of that exchange. Presidential candidates should get to ask each other more questions in the future. Such an approach would add substance, and allowing follow-up questions by the candidates would be even better, since we could more easily judge the depth and knowledge of each candidate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.","Todd Graham: Candidates directed their questions at front-runner Romney .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A second 18-year-old was set Monday to make his first court appearance in connection with the torching of a mosque in the northern Israeli village of Tuba Zangaria, authorities said. The suspect, who was not identified, is the second to be arrested in connection with last week's attack, Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, told CNN. The mosque was set on fire and scrawled with graffiti that indicated it was a revenge attack over the killing of Asher Palmer and his 1-year-old son, who were killed when rocks were thrown at their car in Hebron more than two weeks ago. Words written on the mosque's walls said ""price tag,"" ""revenge"" and ""Palmer."" ""Price tag"" attack is a term frequently used by radical Israeli settlers to denote reprisal attacks against Palestinians in response to moves by the Israeli government to evacuate illegal West Bank outposts. Lately ""price tag"" attacks have also targeted Israeli military forces and police stationed in the West Bank. It is rare for them to carry out attacks inside Israel. After the overnight attack, around 200 residents from the village gathered on the outskirts and started marching towards the neighboring Israeli town of Rosh Pina, an Israeli police spokesman said. Residents blocked the road, hurled rocks at police and burned tires, police said. The police responded by firing tear gas. The second suspect in the mosque burning is also an 18-year-old who appeared before the Kfar Saba Magistrate Court on Thursday, Rosenfeld said. He said the suspect was arrested ""on suspicion of being involved in arson on the mosque in Tuba.""","Two suspects have been arrested on suspicion of torching a mosque in northern Israel, the police say .

"(CNN) -- ""Success breeds success."" So reads the motto of Aga Khan Studs, one of the most formidable breeding operations anywhere in the world. It is at the Aga Khan's vast stud in Normandy that one of the most eagerly-awaited births in the history of racing took place in February of this year when Zarkava, the winner of the 2008 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, gave birth to her foal by 2009 winner Sea the Stars. ""I've rarely had that quality of stock to breed with,"" explains Georges Rimaud, stud manager to the Aga Khan. ""It's not every year you get a female winner of the Arc and a stallion that is also a champion and that you have access to. We tend not to do this type of mating with an unproven horse, with an unproven mare, but we thought this really had to be done."" Despite an undefeated racing career of seven wins over seven starts, including her magnificent Arc triumph, Zarkava is said to be ""unproven"" because she has not as yet produced any winners herself. Many successful racehorses fail to make an impact at stud. But Rimaud believes that the majestic thoroughbred has every chance of being a superior brood mare. ""It's all in the blood. If the foal can get all of the qualities of each of his parents then that would be marvelous. But if he does just half of what they each did individually then I think he will still be pretty good."" Despite his illustrious pedigree, experts are divided about the exact role that genetics plays in determining a future champion. Richard Piercy, a professor at the UK's Royal Veterinary College, believes punters shouldn't be pinning their hopes on the ""superfoal"" just yet. ""Estimates that have been looked at from my research perspective to see how well performance can be inherited suggest that somewhere in the order of between 10-40 per cent of inheritance can come from the parents with regards to performance,"" said Piercy. ""But of course many other factors can relate to whether an animal can be successful or not, such as conditions of the day, the ability of the jockey, the temperament of the horse and other environmental factors -- all of those things also play a role."" Rimaud is sanguine about his colt's chances of emulating the success of his parents: ""We have some very well-bred horses that cannot run to save their lives. That happens. ""Our role is to give him all the opportunities: give him the right food, the right care. There are so many things that are going to happen between now and the day he starts racing. Lots of people are going to be involved. It's a team effort, including him, he's part of the team. ""'Success breeds success'. This is what we say. And it seems to work."" What's in a name? The foal is, as yet, unnamed. He won't be given a formal name until he starts racing at two years old. Georges Rimaud explains the logic behind the name: ""Ideally it should contain a reference to both parents. ""You would take the first three letters from the dam's name and combine that with something to make a word that had some significance. We present a list of names to His Highness the Aga Khan and he makes the final decision.""","Aga Khan Studs is located in the Normandy region of France .

"(CNN) -- Millions of Muslims from around the world were in the holy city of Mecca on Saturday for the first day of Hajj, the annual pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim is expected to perform at least once in his or her life. Dressed in white and following in the footsteps of the prophet Mohammed, pilgrims climbed Mount Arafat, just outside the Saudi Arabian city. Hajj, a five-day pilgrimage, consists of a series of detailed rituals in Mina, Muzdalifa, Arafat and Mecca. It is one of the five pillars of Islam. Will this year's Hajj have an 'Arab Spring' effect? This year's pilgrimage is unique as it is the first to happen since the Arab Spring began last year. Some experts are watching for potential flare-ups in Saudi Arabia, a country governed by an unelected royal family and where freedoms are limited. The pilgrims this year have come from 183 countries, the Saudi Press Agency reported. About 54% of the pilgrims are male. U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement of Saturday to coincide with the start of Hajj. Eid al-Adha, or the Festival of Sacrifice, begins on Sunday. ""Michelle and I extend our greetings for a happy Eid al-Adha to Muslims worldwide and congratulate those performing Hajj. Thousands of Muslim Americans are among those who have joined one of the world's largest and most diverse gatherings in making the pilgrimage to Mecca and nearby sites,"" he said. ""The Eid and Hajj rituals are a reminder of the shared roots of the world's Abrahamic faiths and the powerful role that faith plays in motivating communities to serve and stand with those in need.

"New York (CNN) -- Pop star Lady Gaga stepped up her battle against bullying Wednesday, announcing the creation of a new foundation aimed at empowering youth. In a statement, Lady Gaga called the Born This Way Foundation a ""passion project"" that she will direct with her mother, Cynthia Germanotta. ""Together we hope to establish a standard of bravery and kindness, as well as a community worldwide that protects and nurtures others in the face of bullying and abandonment,"" Lady Gaga said. The non-profit charity -- named for a hit Lady Gaga song -- will support programs and initiatives that empower youth, a statement announcing the foundation said, ""by addressing issues like self-confidence, well-being, anti-bullying, mentoring and career development and will utilize digital mobilization as one of the means to create positive change."" The John D. & Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the California Endowment and the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University are also part of the effort, which will officially launch next year. An advisory board and more details about the organization will be announced soon, the statement said. In September, Lady Gaga said she was aiming to make bullying illegal after the suicide of bullied teen Jamey Rodemeyer. The 14-year-old was found dead outside of his parents home in Buffalo, New York. Rodemeyer, who'd been harassed at school because of his sexuality, counted Gaga as an inspiration. He said in a video he recorded as part of the It Gets Better campaign that he'd found solace and encouragement in the pop star's message of self-acceptance. Following the teen's death, Gaga tweeted, ""The past days I've spent reflecting, crying, and yelling. I have so much anger...It is hard to feel love when cruelty takes someones life....Bullying must become illegal. It is a hate crime. I am meeting with our President. I will not stop fighting. This must end."" CNN's Breeanna Hare contributed to this report.","Lady Gaga calls the Born This Way Foundation a ""passion project""

"(EW.com) -- After ABC changed a new show's mildly profane title during development, upcoming comedy ""Apartment 23"" has now more-or-less reverted to its original head-turning name. The official new title of the show is ""Don't Trust The B----- in Apartment 23,"" dashing out the letters of the curse in an attempt to soften its impact (not entirely unlike how CBS solved buying short-lived ""S**t My Dad Says"" last season, substituting the non-word ""$#*!""). The Disney-owned network has two upcoming shows that previously used the word ""b**ch"" in their title -- ""Don't Trust the B**ch in Apartment 23"" and drama ""Good Christian B**ches."" The former was shorted to ""Apartment 23"" right before the network's broadcast upfront presentation in May. The latter was change to ""Good Christian Belles,"" and was then changed again to ""GCB."" (""Good Christian B**ches,"" in particular, was singled out by some culture critics who were ready to pounce on the show should it hit the air with its original title). 'Dancing with the Stars': Cher was there! (Not that Chaz Bono noticed) In the case of ""Apartment 23,"" the new title was rather anonymous; it didn't tell you anything about the show. The new version more clearly suggests the show's premise -- about a naive midwesterner (Dreama Walker) who moves in with a hardcore party girl (Krysten Ritter). And given that CBS' ""2 Broke Girls"" and Fox's ""New Girl"" have successfully launched girl-with-new-roommate(s)-in-the-big-city premises this fall, the cleverly written ""Apartment 23"" might likewise pop for viewers. The show does not yet have a premiere date, but is expected to debut sometime this season. Although networks are wary about the swear word in a show's title, on-air use is fair game. According to a story in the New York Times a couple years ago, the use of the word ""b**ch"" in primetime tripled in the last decade, growing to 1,277 uses on 685 shows in 2007 from 431 uses on 103 prime-time episodes in 1998.

"(CNN) -- The family of boxing great Joe Frazier on Wednesday announced details of his Philadelphia funeral services and said he died as ""one of God's men."" Frazier, who handed the legendary Muhammad Ali his first defeat, died Monday, just a month after being diagnosed with liver cancer. The 67-year-old athlete's remains will be in public view at the Wells Fargo Center from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. Saturday, the family said. ""This will be an opportunity for his many fans, supporters and boxing lovers from around the world to pay their final respects to Joe Frazier."" The service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church. ""The Family of Joe Frazier continues to stress that they want everyone to know that Joe Frazier was a man of God and a man who loved all of his family,"" relatives said in a statement. Star boxer Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather offered to pay for Frazier's funeral. The family said donations in Frazier's memory can be made to the American Cancer Society. The former heavyweight champion became a legend in his own right and personified the gritty working-class style of his hard-knuckled hometown, Philadelphia -- a fitting setting for the ""Rocky"" film series, starring Sylvester Stallone as hardscrabble boxer Rocky Balboa. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter called Frazier the ""quintessential Philadelphia boxer."" ""You could hear him coming, snorting and grunting and puffing, like a steam engine climbing a steep grade,"" Bill Lyon wrote in a Philadelphia Inquirer column about Frazier, nicknamed ""Smokin' Joe."" Frazier used his devastating left hook with impunity during his professional career, retiring in 1976 with a 32-4-1 record and staging one last comeback fight in 1981. Frazier bested Ali at 1971's ""Fight of the Century"" at Madison Square Garden. In the 15th round, Frazier landed perhaps the most famous left hook in history, catching Ali on the jaw and dropping the former champ for a four-count, according to Frazier's bio at the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Frazier left the ring as the undisputed champ and handed Ali his first professional loss. Ali won a 12-round decision in a January 1974 rematch, setting the stage for the classic ""Thrilla in Manila"" just outside the Philippine capital in 1975. Ali took the early rounds, but Frazier rebounded before losing the last five rounds. By the end of the 14th, Frazier's eyes were nearly swollen shut, and his corner stopped the bout, according to the biography. Frazier, a two-time heavyweight champion for nearly three years until he lost in January 1973 to George Foreman, ran a well-known boxing gym in Philadelphia for years.","Services are scheduled for Monday in Philadelphia .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his government's decision Wednesday to speed up construction in East Jerusalem. ""We will continue to build in Jerusalem. This is our right and obligation,"" Netanyahu said at a Knesset memorial ceremony for former tourism minister Rehavam Ze'evi, who was assassinated by Palestinian militants a decade ago. ""This is not a punishment -- it is our national right to build our capital. I guarantee that we will never return to the situation we had on the evening of the Six Day War,"" Netanyahu said. His remarks came a day after his government announced it was expediting construction of 2,000 housing units in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank and suspending the transfer of Palestinian tax revenue in wake of the Palestinian Authority's successful membership bid at UNESCO, the U.N. cultural, science, and education agency. British Foreign Minister William Hague released a statement Wednesday condemning the Israeli measures and calling them ""a serious blow to the (Middle East) Quartet's efforts to restart peace negotiations."" ""This settlement building program is illegal under international law and is the latest in a series of provocative and unhelpful settlement announcements,"" he said in the statement. In Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama's administration was ""deeply disappointed"" with Israel's announcement. ""Unilateral actions work against efforts for direct negotiations"" necessary to achieve a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Carney told reporters Wednesday. On Tuesday, a senior Israeli official said the planned construction involves 1,650 units in East Jerusalem and the rest in the West Bank settlements of Efrat and Maaleh Adumin. The construction will take place in areas that are expected to be part of Israeli territory in any future peace agreement, the official said, and there is no contradiction between it and the various peace plans that have been on the table. Palestinians claim the land Israel occupied in East Jerusalem and the West Bank after the 1967 war as part of a future Palestinian state. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said repeatedly that the Palestinians will not return to negotiations until Israel halts all settlement construction and accepts the borders in place before the 1967 Six Day War. Israel, for its part, has maintained that negotiations should begin with no preconditions. ""You cannot expect Israel to continue to be restrained when the Palestinian Authority leadership repeatedly slams the door in our face,"" said the Israeli official, who was not authorized to speak to the media. As an example of a door slamming, the official cited the UNESCO bid and the effort to win membership in the United Nations among other instances of Palestinian actions that damaged prospects for a peace deal. The Israeli government has also put a temporary hold on the transfer of Palestinian tax revenue collected by the Israeli government, the official said. Palestinians rely on the revenue to fund government operations, including the payment of public sector salaries. Hague, in his statement, expressed concern about that as well, saying it would have ""direct implications for the Palestinian Authority's ability to maintain effective security in the West Bank."" Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Abbas' spokesman, criticized the Israeli construction announcement Tuesday, calling the decision one ""to accelerate the destruction of the peace process,"" according to WAFA, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency. Senior Palestinian negotiator Mohamad Ishtayeh also condemned the move. ""Two days ago, they (the Israeli government) announced the building of 1 million settlement housing units over the span of 10 years. What Israel decided today was another episode in settlement construction. Using the UNESCO Palestinian membership is only looking for excuses and another way of building settlement housing units. This fits within the overall plan which was announced two days ago before the UNESCO vote,"" he told CNN. Separately on Tuesday, the permanent observer of the Palestinian Authority to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, said he sent a letter to the U.N. secretary-general and the president of the Security Council about Israel. ""We write today to express our grave concern about the military escalation undertaken by Israel, the occupying Power, against the Gaza Strip,"" he wrote. Within the past four days, Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 11 people and injured many more, Mansour said. Since Saturday, scores of rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza, resulting in the death of one Israeli civilian and the temporary closure of schools and universities in the southern part of the country. The United States said Monday that it would cut funding to UNESCO after the agency voted in support of Palestinian membership. The vote, which required two-thirds approval by UNESCO members, passed with 107 in favor, 14 against, and 52 abstentions. It was the first such vote by a part of the world body and is separate from the Palestinian bid for full membership in the United Nations. After Monday's vote, Palestinian officials told CNN they are considering the pursuit of membership in other international groups, such as the World Health Organization. ""Instead of sitting around the negotiating table,"" Netanyahu said after the vote, Palestinian leaders ""have decided to make an alliance with Hamas and are carrying out one-sided endeavors in the U.N., including today. We will not sit with folded arms against these measures which are hurting Israel and are violating bluntly the most basic obligations the parties took in the peace process, to solve the conflict between us through negotiations.""","NEW: The White House expresses disappointment at Israel's move .

"New York (CNN) -- As snow fell across New York Harbor, Isabel Belarsky clutched her mother, Clara, aboard a passenger ship that puttered toward Ellis Island and wondered what their new lives would bring. The year was 1930. About a week earlier, the 10-year-old girl from what is now called St. Petersburg, Russia, had embarked on a transatlantic journey with her Ukrainian parents from the French port city of Cherbourg, escaping what she described as Jewish persecution at the start of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union. On an island near Manhattan stood the copper colossus that would etch her first memories of the new world. ""It was a wonderful sight,"" she said of the Statue of Liberty, which marked its 125th anniversary Friday. The idea for the monument is thought to have been conceived at a 19th-century dinner party among French aristocrats, historians say, who sought to pay tribute to American liberty. And while the French gift is also widely believed to have at least in part catered to domestic politics, for many, it quickly became a symbol of hope and promise in America's post- Civil War period. ""The arrival on Ellis Island is the fulfillment that you know something good is going to happen to you,"" said Belarksy, now a 91-year-old widow living in a Russian enclave of Brooklyn, New York. Her family became part of the more than 12 million immigrants processed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954, according to the U.S. National Park Service. Adjacent to Ellis towers Lady Liberty, measuring more than 305 feet from base to torch. Originally, the statue was supposed to be an Egyptian peasant girl that would have stood at the entrance of Egypt's then-new Suez Canal, but plans would evolve into the Roman goddess who would instead adorn New York Harbor. ""The sculptor, (Frederic) Bartholdi, was very clever,"" said Edward Berenson, professor of history and director of the Institute of French Studies at New York University. ""He put (the statue) where he did because it's right at the narrows of New York Harbor, so he knew that every boat that came into New York would have to come really close to it. People felt like they could reach out and touch it,"" he said. Inspired perhaps by Egypt's colossal statues during his own travels to Cairo, Berenson noted, Bartholdi sought to build a monument of his own in a tribute to American liberty and its newfound emancipation of the slaves. The statue rests atop a sculpted wrangling of broken chains on New York's Liberty Island. Only years later, Berenson argues, did the monument come to symbolize immigration to the broader public, despite the structure's engraved plaque bearing the now-famous poem by Emma Lazarus, asking for the ""huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" Like many who made the perilous journey, Belarsky said, she had often wondered what kind of life was waiting for her on the shores behind the monument. ""It was quite frightening,"" she recalled. ""The three of us, my father, my mother and I, wanted for someone to come with money or to tell us what's next."" And though a U.S. law passed six years earlier had largely restricted immigration, her father, Sidor, had managed to secure three tickets to America by way of a talent scout who visited the Leningrad conservatory where he had performed as an opera singer. ""He had such a beautiful voice,"" she said. Their travel permit, however, was only temporary. Sidor had acquired a six-month visa to teach at Brigham Young University, Belarsky said. The young family would nonetheless settle more permanently in a west Manhattan apartment. And unlike many who eventually returned to their homelands in Europe, the Belarskys decided to leave St. Petersburg -- then known as Leningrad -- behind. ""Authorities were starting to clamp down and consolidate the social state and Soviet power around Stalin,"" said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. ""As an opera singer, you might not have wanted to start singing Soviet anthems."" So the young family left Russia without plans to return, Belarsky added. And though many immigrants entered the United States through Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, New Orleans and Miami, historians say steamship companies most often cruised into New York Harbor, commonly making the Statue of Liberty the first land sighting for new arrivals. ""Everybody spoke of the golden land,"" Belarksy said. "" 'Come to America, where there's gold on the streets,' until they came here and they had to live in walk-up tenement houses,"" she said, referencing hardships often endured in overcrowded city buildings. Immigrants also commonly faced unsanitary and unsafe work conditions on docks and in factories as America's need for industrial labor grew. ""If you think immigration is unpopular now,"" Berenson said, ""if anything, it was even more unpopular in the 1890s and the first part of the 20th century."" Successive immigrant waves, however, still rushed to America's shores through Ellis Island and past the Statue of Liberty, often buoyed by the prospect of economic opportunity. ""I think it took a while for people to think of themselves as Americans,"" Berenson said. ""For an awful lot of people, what they wanted was to think of themselves as whatever they were originally and as Americans too."" Anniversary celebrations of the Statue of Liberty were marked Friday by a series of official speeches and an array of webcams, provided by Earthcam, that streamed video footage from the torch. The statue will close for renovations starting Saturday, though Liberty Island will remain open, according to the National Park Service.","Friday marks the 125th anniversary of the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty .

"(CNN) -- During a 1996 interview with television talk show host Charlie Rose, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs took exception to Rose's characterization of him as ""a guy who founds high-tech companies and tries to make another billion."" ""Yeah, well, I don't think of myself that way,"" Jobs said. ""The things that I have done in my life, I think the things we do now at Pixar [the animation company he bought in 1986], these are team sports. They are not something one person does."" If pop culture were a team sport, Jobs would have certainly played quarterback. From the invention of iTunes, which completely changed the business of music, to offering the world its first completely full-length computer-generated animated film with Pixar's ""Toy Story"" in 1995, Jobs left his indelible fingerprints on the entertainment industry. The other ""toys"" he helped create like the iPod, iPhone and iPad not only changed the way the world consumed media, but also inserted both Jobs and Apple firmly into the entertainment zeitgeist. Even the commercials, from the 1984, George Orwell-inspired Super Bowl Macintosh ad to the more recent ""Are you a Mac or a PC,"" were uber-cool. While Jobs has been more well known and hailed for his innovation with high-tech, he also made some power moves which forever changed Hollywood. And in what sounds like a fantasy dreamed up by the geek gods, it all began with George Lucas. As Jobs explained to the news program ""60 Minutes"" in 2003, when Lucas was creating ""Star Wars"" he reasoned that digital copy of his film would be clearer and cleaner than analog. The computer graphics division of his Lucasfilm company, which honed the technology behind the process, would go on to become Pixar Animation Studios after Jobs bought it for $10 million in 1986. As chairman and chief executive officer of Pixar, Jobs led the way in marrying the endless possibilities of technology with the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry. The world hadn't even heard of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in 1991 when Pixar struck a deal with Walt Disney Studios to develop and distribute three full-length animated films. The first of these, ""Toy Story,"" captured audience's hearts with its tale of the adventures of a group of children's toys. ""Toy Story"" went on to become the top-earning film of that year, grossing $192 million in domestic box office receipts and $362 million worldwide. It spurred two sequels, theme park attractions and an extensive line of merchandise. It was followed by films like ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Monster's Inc.,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""The Incredibles,"" the last two of which won Academy Awards for best animated feature. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006. By then he was firmly back in the driver's seat as the chief executive officer of Apple, which was setting the world afire with its inventions. One of his biggest launches was in 2003 with the iTunes Music Store, which revolutionized the world of music downloads. ""Other companies sold digital music before Apple,"" said Bill Werde, editorial director of Billboard, said in a statement. ""Other companies made digital music available on computers and digital phones and used it in commercials. Apple's brilliance -- and I don't think anyone doubts that this was Steve Jobs' brilliance -- was that Apple made it exciting and simple and effortless and fun."" Jobs was a major influence on portable media, which paved the way for gamers to be able to engage in their favorite past time via handheld devices and film fans to be able to stream movies almost anywhere. The introduction of the 99-cent single meant music lovers no longer had to purchase an entire album to selectively enjoy their favorite tunes. The ability of the iPod, and later the iPhone and iPad, to hold thousands of songs also meant that fans never had to be far from their tunes. ""Thanks for allowing me to put my whole CD collection in my pocket,"" Sebastian Bach, ex-frontman of the heavy metal band Skid Row tweeted after news of Jobs' death was made public. ""You have made air travel a lot more fun among other things."" Innovation was not without some growing pains, however. Some industry insiders worried that digital downloads were negatively affecting sales of music and the issue of piracy became a hot one. On Tuesday, Miramax chief executive officer Mike Lang in his keynote address at MIPCOM, a TV and entertainment event held in Cannes, France, pointed to digital monopolies like the one Apple has as potentially damaging to the industry. ""Apple is the strongest company in the music industry because there was not enough competition, and still to this day there is not enough competition,"" Lang said. ""As an industry it can't then influence packaging, merchandising -- all the things that are vital.""

"(CNN) -- ESPN says it has severed its relationship with singer Hank Williams Jr. ""We have decided to part ways with Hank Williams Jr. We appreciate his contributions over the past years,"" the network said in a statement released Thursday. The success of 'Monday Night Football' has always been about the games and that will continue."" Williams, the 62-year-old son of the legendary country singer Hank Williams and a widely popular entertainer himself, compared President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler, a remark that prompted controversy and resulted in ""Monday Night Football"" pulling his popular musical introduction from this week's game. The song ""All My Rowdy Friends"" had been the ""Monday Night Football"" theme on both ABC and ESPN since 1991. Williams issued a statement giving a very different version: ""After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made MY decision. By pulling my opening Oct 3rd, You (ESPN) stepped on the Toes of The First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore Me, My Song, and All My Rowdy Friends are OUT OF HERE. It's been a great run."" In an appearance on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" on Monday morning, Williams referred to a June golf game in which Obama and House Speaker John Boehner were on the same team, against Vice President Joe Biden and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, as ""one of the biggest political mistakes ever."" Asked what he didn't like about it, Williams said, ""Come on, come on. That'd be like Hitler playing golf with (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu. OK. Not hardly."" When one of the Fox News interviewers later pointed out that Williams invoked ""one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe ... the president,"" Williams responded: ""That is true, but I'm telling you like it is, you know. That just wasn't a good thing. It just didn't fly. So anyway, like Fred Thompson said, you don't want to ask me a question because I'm going to give you too straight of an answer. So talk about something else."" The singer apologized on Tuesday, saying, ""My analogy was extreme -- but it was to make a point. ""I have always been very passionate about politics and sports and this time it got the best or worst of me. ""The thought of the leaders of both parties jukin' and high fiven' on a golf course, while so many families are struggling to get by, simply made me boil over and make a dumb statement, and I am very sorry if it offended anyone. I would like to thank all my supporters. This was not written by some publicist,"" Williams wrote. The Anti-Defamation League condemned Williams' comments on Tuesday and praised ESPN for pulling his ""Are You Ready for Some Football?"" musical recording that has opened ""Monday Night Football"" for years. ""The Holocaust was a singular event in human history, and it is an insult to the memory of the millions who died as a result of Hitler's plan of mass extermination to compare the Nazi dictator to any American president,"" said Abraham H. Foxman, the league's national director and a Holocaust survivor. ""Hank Williams Jr. should know better. He owes an apology to Holocaust survivors, their families, and the brave American soldiers who gave of themselves to fight the Nazi menace during World War II. The last thing we need is to enter another election cycle on a sour note tainted with inappropriate, tired and over-the-top analogies to the Nazis,"" he said. Williams has criticized Obama in the past, when the Democrat was running for the presidency. In 2008, Williams was even mentioned in some media outlets as saying he was considering running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican in the next election cycle, but those plans never materialized. Williams, who supported the Republican ticket in 2008 and even penned a song called ""McCain-Palin Tradition,"" said during that campaign that candidate Obama didn't like the national anthem. The ""McCain-Palin Tradition"" song, which is a riff on the Williams tune ""Family Tradition,"" included a line suggesting that Obama has ""terrorist friends."". Williams was born May 26, 1949, and his iconic father nicknamed him ""Bocephus"" after a ventriloquist dummy used by Rod Brasfield, a country comedian, Williams' website says. He debuted on the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, at age 11. In addition to ""All My Rowdy Friends,"" his other hits include ""Long Gone Lonesome Blues,"" ""Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound,"" ""Old Habits,"" ""Born to Boogie,"" and ""A Country Boy Can Survive."" The bearded Williams, who wears a hat and sunglasses during performances, suffered facial and head injuries in a 1975 mountain climbing accident. ""Those familiar with Hank Jr.'s legend know it hasn't been an easy road. Every life and career has its peaks and valleys, but Williams has had more than his share. When he sings ""A Country Boy Can Survive,"" there's an authority in his voice, because he's done just that. He literally fell from a mountain top, yet lived to tell the tale. He's battled his own demons and now on the other side of 50, it's obvious he has been the victor,"" his website bio says.","NEW: ""All My Rowdy Friends"" has been the MNF intro since '91 .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Authorities found two severed heads along a highway in Mexico City on Monday morning, the city's attorney general said. The heads were inside a car near the border dividing the city from neighboring Mexico state, Attorney General Miguel Mancera told reporters. The nation's defense ministry was also nearby. A lengthy message was left beside the heads, Mancera said, detailing that a drug gang known as ""The Hand With Eyes"" was responsible. ""It ends saying that the territory of 'The Hand With Eyes' is so extensive that it has reached the metropolitan area and hasn't disappeared,"" Mancera said. Police in Mexico City arrested the gang's suspected leader, Oscar Osvaldo Garcia, also known as ""The Hand With Eyes,"" in August. Mancera said Monday that authorities remained committed to tracking down members of the gang and stopping its growth. Authorities were still working Monday to identify the victims. Beheadings have become a signature sign of the brutally violent turf battles between drug cartels that have plagued cities across Mexico. Last week authorities in the beach resort city of Acapulco made a similar discovery, finding five severed human heads inside a small wooden crate, Guerrero state authorities said. But such violence is rare in the country's capital. ""Mexico City has been surprisingly calm in the midst of the turbulence of this conflict with organized crime, while other major cities are experiencing major upturns in violence,"" said Eric Olson, a security expert at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. ""It hasn't exploded the way it has (elsewhere). There's always that fear of that happening, because there's nothing to guarantee that it won't.""

Shoichet, and CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","NEW: A message left by a drug gang claims responsibility, the city's prosecutor says .

"(CNN) -- Voldemort did not die in vain. Ralph Fiennes may have dedicated a good part of the last decade to torturing Harry Potter, but he's also found the time, the energy and the clout to pull off his first film as director. By any standards, ""Coriolanus"" is an ambitious undertaking, a modern-day interpretation of one of Shakespeare's meatiest but less frequently performed plays. Although not everything comes off, Fiennes' bold, dynamic movie will make you glad he took up the challenge. Set in ""Some place calling itself Rome,"" but filmed, very tellingly, in battle-scarred Serbia and Montenegro, ""Coriolanus"" imagines a modern state rocked by food shortages and border disputes. Gen. Caius Martius (Fiennes) returns triumphant from vanquishing archenemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) and the Volsces from their stronghold, Corioles, and takes on the name of this, his most famous victory. But an attempt to make him consul, or head of state, alarms some senators who know his contempt for ordinary civilians. While he easily carries the Senate, tradition demands that Caius, now known as ""Coriolanus,"" must also seek the assent of the citizenry in the public market. Too proud to court public opinion, he goes through the motions, but when his enemies turn the crowd against him, his fury only makes matters worse and the general is banished from Rome. Alone and angry, he swears vengeance and offers his services to Aufidius. As in other modern-dress Shakespearean adaptations, there are anomalies and eccentricities in this production, which brandishes guns and tanks but talks of swords and ultimately falls back on knife fights. The notion of the warrior-hero who can carry battles single-handedly doesn't really jibe with modern warfare, and it's been a while since we had a military man as president. Shakespeare's play leaves no doubt that however we value heroism on the battlefield, it's no qualification for success in politics. Coriolanus is undone by his own peculiar integrity, a refusal to exploit his war record for votes; but only because he finds the democratic process demeaning -- he's a pure elitist, the kind of person who believes that birthright is destiny. In power, he'd be a disaster. Not that the scheming, cynical professional politicians come out much better in this telling, or the fickle and easily manipulated populace for that matter. Politics is a dirty business, but Coriolanus betrays everyone he's ever known to uphold his own warped sense of honor. Head shaved, scarred, and often caked in blood, Fiennes is utterly compelling, a kind of Roman Rambo. We know he can play villains, but even if he's essentially a fascist, there is something noble about Coriolanus, and tragic, too, in his inability to bend or compromise. He is his own man, though we see very well that he's entirely the creation of his ferocious mother, Volumnia (a magnificent Vanessa Redgrave), and ultimately powerless before her. Substantially streamlined by screenwriter and playwright John Logan (whose scripts for ""Rango"" and ""Hugo"" also made it to the screen last year), Shakespeare's verse sounds a bit strange in the voice of cable TV newscasters, but the device works very well to convey background information and keep the action flowing. Logan has cut the play in half, but what it loses in detail the movie more than picks up in clarity and punch. Budget constraints probably account for Rome's surprisingly meager population and a Volsci army that seems to number about two dozen, but you can't argue with the talent in the foreground: Brian Cox, Jessica Chastain and Gerard Butler don't misplace a single syllable between them. This is Shakespearean acting of the highest caliber, and a powerful, bloody vision of ""honor"" gone mad.","By any standards, ""Coriolanus"" is an ambitious undertaking .

"(CNN) -- Before Saturday, a Florida teenager who sent or received nude photos or video could have been charged with a felony and forced to register as a sex offender. But a new law, recognizing the proliferation of cell phones and computers, eases the penalties for ""sexting"" infractions. A first offense is punishable by eight hours of community service or a $60 fine; the second is a misdemeanor and the third is a felony. State Rep. Joseph Abruzzo, D-Wellington, sponsored the legislation, which was approved in June. ""When our child pornography laws were written, they failed to take into account advances in technology, such as cell phones,"" Abruzzo said in a statement published on the website of CNN affiliate WPBF in West Palm Beach. ""(This bill) modernizes these laws to ensure that children's lives are not ruined due to youthful indiscretion. This reform will let our youth know that such behavior is wrong without labeling them sex offenders for the rest of their lives."" CNN could not immediately reach Abruzzo for comment Saturday. Under House Bill 75, teens who receive explicit images won't be charged if they took reasonable steps to report it, did not solicit the image and did not send it to someone. A recent Associated Press/MTV poll of Internet behavior found one of three teen and young adult respondents said they've taken part in ""sexting,"" which includes sending sexually charged texts. The survey is part of MTV's ""A Thin Line"" campaign, a multi-year effort to stamp out digital abuse. Seventy-one percent of the survey's respondents said that ""sexting"" is a problem for Web users their age. Ten percent of respondents who said they'd exchanged sexual messages said they'd done so with people they know only online -- a steep drop from the 29 percent who said they'd done so in 2009. ""There's probably a lot of kids who don't realize how this (sexting) could impact their life,"" Karl Bergstrom of Fort Myers told CNN affiliate WINK.","New Florida law eases penalties for teens engaged in ""sexting""

"(CNN) -- William Beach was one of those people who fixated on certain foods. He would eat the same thing voraciously for a few days, and then, when he tired of the same tastes, he moved onto something else. In August, when summer's heat seemed unending in Mustang, Oklahoma, Beach took to savoring fried chicken -- and soft, sweet cantaloupe. Beach was elderly -- 87 -- but after eating the fruit, his health declined rather suddenly and before anyone in his family knew what was wrong, he was dead. He is among 15 people who died from Listeria monocytogenes in what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998. Gallery: The decade's 10 biggest food-borne illness outbreaks . The bacteria was traced to Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms' fields in Granada, Colorado. As of Monday, the outbreak had affected people in 19 states. The CDC first reported it publicly on September 12, six days after William Beach's family buried him. Listeria? What's that? Beach and his wife Monette bought the tainted cantaloupe at a Homeland grocery, where the store motto says: ""the best is fresh."" A week after he ate the fruit, Beach felt malaise, perhaps not unusual for a man of 87 years. But then his face turned the shade of a tomato. Soon he had trouble breathing and collapsed on the living room floor, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms. Monette heard him struggling to pull himself up off the floor. She hobbled into the room with her cane and saw her husband of 67 years unable to speak, unable to get up. She dialed 911 and an ambulance whisked Beach to Baptist Hospital in nearby Oklahoma City. He was discharged the next day but when he got worse at home, he returned to the hospital. One of Beach's six daughters, Brenda Hathaway met her father at the emergency room. Beach told her he didn't want Monette to see him this way. Listeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults, according to the CDC, but it is particularly dangerous for pregnant women and the elderly or people with weakened immune systems. On the evening of September 1, medical staff tried to intubate Beach but he began hemorrhaging from the mouth and nose, the court documents said. Soon after, he died. Monette never saw her husband alive again. Two days after his funeral, an official from the Oklahoma State Department of Health called Hathaway. She was told then that her father had tested positive for Listeria. Hathaway's sister Debbie Frederick said the family wondered why it took the hospital two days to release her father's body. They had assumed he died of natural causes. ""We knew it was some sort of infection, but we did not know what it was,"" she said. But Listeria? She had never even heard that word before. What you need to know about Listeria . Health officials began questioning Beach's daughters. What had he eaten in the weeks prior? They specifically asked if he had consumed cantaloupes. Frederick, meanwhile, glued herself to her computer, determined to learn more about the illness that killed her father. ""Doing all that reading, it became patently clear that the health departments knew there was an issue,"" she said. ""They knew there was a Listeria problem."" The Beach family's angst led to a lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms. Frederick said she hopes the lawsuit will help strengthen food safety laws. ""It's a terrible thing to lose someone you love to something that could be prevented,"" she said. ""I pray that it's over. I hope nobody else has to lose a loved one."" Battling the bacteria . In Littleton, Colorado, Jeni Exley's parents, Herbert and Elaine Stevens, were getting ready to celebrate 60 years of marriage on September 8. They still had a good life together. Despite his age -- 84 -- he felt spry enough to take the dogs out for a walk in their Littleton neighborhood. He let Elaine do most of the grocery shopping and cooking but he could make his own sandwiches for lunch. How to keep your food safe . In early August, Elaine came home from the nearby King Soopers market with half a Jensen Farms cantaloupe. She didn't buy the whole thing -- it was only the two of them. Besides, she liked to able to see through the cellophane and decide if it was ripe enough. She and Herbert both ate the lush fruit. Herbert started to feel sick, just like William Beach. Four days before Beach was rushed to hospital in Oklahama, Stevens couldn't get up from the toilet in Colorado. He had a fever of 103 degrees and felt nauseous. Elaine called an ambulance which ferried her husband to Littleton Adventist Hospital. Unlike the Beach family, Stevens' daughters learned after a few days that their father was infected with Listeria. Exley, 55, like Frederick, went online to learn more about the bacteria that had sickened her father. Health officials, after questioning Elaine about what the couple had eaten in the last few weeks, determined that Herbert Stevens was a part of the latest outbreak. After antibiotic therapy, Stevens was transferred to a nursing home. Exley arrived on her parents anniversary with chocolate milkshakes in hand. But her father wasn't feeling well. He was sent back to the hospital when his condition worsened. Stevens eventually regained some of his strength. He was sent to a skilled nursing facility to recuperate on September 19, the same day that the Food and Drug Administration announced it had found Listeria monocytogenes in samples of Jensen Farms' Rocky Ford cantaloupes. Stevens' Listeria is gone but at that age, he will probably never return to the man he was, Exley said. A little bit of him went with his bout with the bacteria. He uses a walker now to move around; all his body functions seem affected, Exley said. ""I think it is amazing that he even survived,"" she said. ""I am surprised he is not one of those people who died."" The Stevens are also suing Jensen Farms in hopes of recouping some of their medical costs. Exley, who loves cantaloupe, feels extremely lucky her family escaped tragedy. She, too, had bought some of the tainted fruit and received an automated phone call at home warning her about the recall. She, like Frederick, thought she could trust what she was buying at the neighborhood grocery store. From now on, she will think twice. And fill her shopping cart with apples and oranges instead.","Before his family knew what Listeria was, William Beach was dead .

"(CNN) -- Gerardo Naranjo's ""Miss Bala"" is one of these films that comes along every so often that captures the imaginations of the critics and has most of us dancing around singing ""Hallelujah."" Every time this happens, however, there are one or two critics of otherwise sound mind who have a less than enthusiastic reaction. This time it's my turn. Not to say that ""Miss Bala"" isn't an entertaining, well made and thought provoking film. It is. It also boasts some exceptional acting work from its lead, Stephanie Sigman, as well as a chilling turn from Noe Hernandez, as the menacing gangster who insinuates himself into her life. It's just that I wasn't blown away and while we critics don't exactly have a hive mind, when you come across a film that is worshiped by many colleagues who you respect that you simply ""like,"" you wonder if only for a moment, whether there's something wrong with you. Laura (Sigman) is a stunningly beautiful young woman in her early 20s living in Tijuana, Mexico, who dreams of winning the Miss Baja title. The day before she is to audition for the pageant, Laura and her friend Suzu (Lakshmi Picazo), also an aspiring beauty queen, end up in a seedy nightclub populated by dangerous men and the women who love them (which includes Suzu). A victim of ""wrong place at wrong time"" syndrome, Laura ends up being the only living witness to a massacre perpetrated by Lino (Hernandez) the local drug kingpin and his gang, as they storm the nightclub. While searching for Jessica the next morning, Laura makes the mistake of trusting a local traffic officer with her story and things go markedly downhill from there. Lino takes an immediate shine to Laura (who wouldn't?) and rather brazenly begins to use her in his criminal endeavors, including running cash across the border for weapons, all in exchange not only for the safety of her father and brother, but also so Lino will fix the beauty pageant. It's like watching the fastest case of Stockholm Syndrome on record. Laura comes across as a weak and superficial woman and while this isn't a problem in and of itself, it can be frustrating to watch such a character repeatedly make what, to me, were obvious mistakes. Then again, I have never been in her situation. I guess you could say I had a failure in my ability to suspend disbelief. The film is expertly shot, however, and director Naranjo does a great job creating dread, building suspense and pacing the film as things get darker and darker for Laura. Alas, along the way she makes mistake after mistake. ""Miss Bala"" is based on the true story of former Miss Sinaloa, Laura Zúñiga, who was arrested in 2008 for being part of an international drug trafficking ring. All in all, there is enough suspense, quality acting and truly harrowing scenes in ""Miss Bala"" but I felt like I should like it more than I did. ""Miss Bala"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It's extremely violent with contact gunbattles and contains an upsetting but non-graphic scene of rape.","""Miss Bala"" is based on the true story of former Miss Sinaloa, Laura Zúñiga .

"New York (CNN) -- Several unions endorsed the two-week-old Occupy Wall Street movement and plan to join the protesters' street theater in New York on Wednesday, labor leaders said. ""It's really simple. These young people on Wall Street are giving voice to many of the problems that working people in America have been confronting over the last several years,"" Larry Hanley, international president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, which has 20,000 member in the New York area, told CNN. ""These young people are speaking for the vast majority of Americans who are frustrated by the bankers and brokers who have profited on the backs of hard-working people,"" Hanley added in a statement. ""While we battle it out day after day, month after month, the millionaires and billionaires on Wall Street sit by -- untouched -- and lecture us on the level of our sacrifice."" Contribute your images, video and words to CNN's coverage . Transport Workers Union Local 100 spokesman Jim Gannon said the Occupy Wall Street movement, which denounces social inequities in the financial system and draws inspiration from the Arab Spring revolutions in Africa and the Middle East, has advanced issues that unions typically support. ""Their goals are our goals,"" Gannon said. ""They brought a spotlight on issues that we've believed in for quite some time now.... Wall Street caused the implosion in the first place and is getting away Scot-free while workers, transit workers, everybody, is forced to pay for their excesses. ""These young folks have brought a pretty bright spotlight,"" Gannon added. ""It's kind of a natural alliance."" Just who are these people? President Michael Mulgrew of the United Federation of Teachers, the sole bargaining agent for most non-supervisory New York City public teachers with 200,000 members, said he was ""proud"" to support the Occupy demonstrators, who have been camping out in New York and elsewhere across the nation. ""The way our society is now headed it does not work for 99% of people, so when Occupy Wall Street started ... they kept to it and they've been able to create a national conversation that we think should have been going on for years,"" Mulgrew said. The labor officials couldn't provide a projection on how many of their members will take the day off from work Wednesday and join the protests. The demonstrators have bivouacked in the park in New York's Financial District, calling for 20,000 people to flood the area for a ""few months."" The protest campaign -- which uses the hashtag #occupywallstreet on the microblogging site Twitter -- began in July with the launch of a simple campaign website calling for a march and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange. Over the past two weeks, demonstrations have addressed various issues, including police brutality, union busting and the economy, the group said. Occupy Wall Street is a leaderless movement made largely of twentysomethings upset with the state of the economy, the state of the war in Afghanistan, the state of the environment, and the state of America and the world in general. View a gallery of high-resolution photos from the protests . In less than three weeks, the movement has become a magnet for countless disaffected Americans at a time when an overwhelming majority of U.S. adults say the country's on the wrong track. Occupy protests have been held in Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Boston. Occupy Wall Street and its offshoots have clear strains of liberal economic populism -- a powerful force in U.S. history during various times characterized by growing economic stress. That said, it could be a mistake to label or tie the movement to a specific agenda, said Susan Olzak, a Stanford University sociology professor. ""It's difficult to classify a social protest movement early on in its history,"" Olzak told CNN. ""Clearer goals could eventually emerge, but there's no guarantee."" ""Many movements fizzle out. Others become more organized,"" she said. But ""I think we run a risk (by) taking a snapshot at any one point in time, and trying to categorize the movement in any one way based on that snapshot. The only way to study these protest movements is to follow them over time.""

"(CNN) -- South Korea and the United States postponed joint anti-submarine military exercises due to an approaching tropical storm, U.S. Forces Korea said. The exercises were scheduled to begin Sunday and run through Thursday, the forces said in a statement. Tropical Storm Malou is forecast to arrive in the region Monday. Military officials said the exercise could have gone ahead despite the weather, but safety concerns prompted the postponement. ""Although the alliance is capable of operating in all weather conditions, this decision was made in the interest of safety for the participants,"" the U.S. military said in its statement. ""Both high winds and heavy seas would have directly impacted the exercise area and the training objectives."" The exercises will be rescheduled but a new date has not been set, the statement said. U.S. officials have said the naval exercises off the western coast of the Korean peninsula are in response to North Korea's alleged sinking of a South Korean warship last March. ""We said that we would continue a series of exercises that are defensive in nature, that are designed to send a clear message to North Korea,"" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said in August. Tensions between North Korea and South Korea, as well as between North Korea and the U.S., have escalated since a May report from Seoul, South Korea, blamed the North for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March. The report, whose findings have been endorsed by the U.S., alleged that a North Korean sub sank the Cheonan warship with a torpedo, killing 46 sailors. North Korea denies it sunk the ship and has sharply criticized the military exercises, describing them as war games conducted under a false pretext. ""The U.S. forces side would be seriously mistaken if it calculates it can browbeat [North Korea] through large-scale war exercises,"" the state-run KCNA news agency said in July. ""It should immediately stop the [anti-North Korean] nuclear war racket.""

"(CNN) -- In my mind -- and in the law -- there are two kinds of sexual harassment. The first kind is quid pro quo and easy to spot. A really detestable (usually) man gives his (usually) female subordinate employee or student an ultimatum: Put out or lose some opportunity, be it a grade, a job or a promotion. During the ""Mad Men"" era, bosses got away with such, and women thought it the price of a life outside the kitchen. No more. Women no longer think this is OK. Professors even lose tenure over this clearly sexist and illegal behavior these days. We've come a long way on the road to equality on this front. Lawyers don't settle such claims for a few months' salary and a promise of silence. No one knows right now if this is the kind of sexual harassment that Herman Cain is accused of, but I doubt it. For one thing, several others have claimed they witnessed the harassment of the women in question, and such bold threats aren't often made over the dinner table in a restaurant with observers. But then there is the other kind of sexual harassment, the behavior that makes the workplace uncomfortable, that creates an environment that is hostile to women in general, or just to one person because of her (or his) sex, gender, race or ethnicity. Everyone agrees that workplaces ought not to differentiate between actors simply because of their sex, gender, race or ethnicity. But beyond that, when sex and gender are involved, we often get into a ""he said/she said"" dialogue. For example, he believed the jokes were simply funny and created a more friendly setting; she believed they were offensive and created an us (the boys) versus them (her or her and other women) organizational climate where she was always going to be outside the loop, outside informal conversations and social networks that mattered. Another example might be when a powerful man is attracted to one of his co-workers and simply wants to start some sort of sexual friendship, an offer he perhaps had made many times before and occasionally was accepted. But this time, the woman finds a sexual overture from a married boss intimidating and off-putting. She believes it changes forever the climate of the workplace. Even if he never threatened her status after the ""invitation,"" she didn't believe the professional relationship would ever be the same after what she perceived to be sexual harassment. If we look at sexual harassment in these terms, as he said/she said, we will never find a solution -- ethical, legal or moral to the problem. At this point, we have yet to create any consensus around the appropriate way to deal with sexual attraction and sexual desire in the workplace. No one can deny that workplaces are often where adults meet their life partners. In a 24/7 work environment, where else do you have to meet a spouse? And indeed, in a world where people often think of themselves as defined by ""what they do,"" it makes sense that those who also do it are the people we have enough in common with to fall for, whether it's to fall in love, or even just in lust. And yet, we are still in a world where the most powerful class of actors happens to be older men. We do not live in some post-feminist world, where power is yet equally shared. No one wants to anger or displease one's boss, even a little. Nor do we live in a world where the workplaces have become truly integrated by sex. In fact, the most recent research suggests that in the last decade, we've stalled at integration by sex. While women are getting more and more of the degrees, they remain in traditionally female-dominated fields, and are not moving forward in male-dominated ones. My hypothesis for why is that heavily male-dominated occupations, including politics, are so heavily masculine in their cultures, full of sexual innuendo and -- perhaps -- the kind of sexual harassment of which Cain is accused. I don't have an easy answer, but I do know we'll never solve the problem by trying to figure out what he said or she said. Instead, we have to decide what, as a society, we want to be acceptable or not in our workplaces and schools and then enforce the norms with legal penalties. Here's a first volley: It should be illegal for men (or women) to make sexual overtures to their subordinates. End of story. Power always gets in the way of easily saying no. But more than that, if we want workplaces that do not privilege the men who have previously dominated the social space, we need to change the culture in which sexual banter objectifies women and turns them into the ""other,"" and take seriously the claims by women that men harass them. The more subtle kind of sexual harassment has consequences not only for the individual woman who finally complains, but for all of us, by sustaining a culture where the powerful positions in many occupations, including politics, remain dominated by men. Should accepting boorish sexual banter and unwanted sexual approaches be the price of admission to male-dominated occupations? It's up to us as a society to set the standards. Here is a moment in time to take stock: Let's hear what the women who were silenced by being paid off have to say about the private behavior of a very public man who is running for president. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barbara Risman.","Barbara Risman: Society hasn't reached consensus on what's OK in workplace .

"(CNN) -- After 60 years of waiting, Egyptians may very well find themselves with a strong, assertive Parliament. On Monday and Tuesday, millions of Egyptians spent hours in long, looping lines, waiting to cast ballots in the country's first elections since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak. The two days of voting felt like a success, particularly because in the days leading up to the vote, Egypt seemed on the verge of implosion. Street battles in Tahrir Square had claimed more than 40 lives, as police used brute force in an attempt to subdue protesters. There was talk of postponing the vote. But elections were held as scheduled, and, surprisingly, there was neither major violence nor reports of systematic fraud or irregularities. Why, then, does the optimism that Egyptians have every right to feel remain tenuous? Part of the attraction of voting is the release that comes from knowing who won. Here, though, delayed gratification is the order of the day. Egypt has an odd, three-round voting system, so Egyptians won't know the official outcome until January. (Preliminary results, though, appear to show the Muslim Brotherhood with a commanding lead.) More problematic, though, is the confusion surrounding the role of Parliament. The ruling military council is hoping for a weak Parliament; Egypt's political parties, however, may have other plans. During political transitions, institutional roles often remain undefined and fluid, shaped by the decisions of the individuals and parties themselves. A strong Parliament depends on a critical mass of parliamentarians who believe in -- and fight for -- their institution's power. Because Egypt is still operating under a presidential system, with the ruling military council as the executive authority, Parliament will not be able to form a government. But it will likely be able to withhold confidence from the Cabinet, oversee the budget, and pass legislation. Most importantly, the Parliament will appoint a committee to draft a new constitution. This constitution will determine the balance of powers between the executive branch and legislative branches. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party -- which will control a sizable plurality of seats -- supports a pure parliamentary system, with either a ceremonial president or no president at all. Some of the Brotherhood's critics see this as a relatively transparent power grab, which it may, in fact, be. At the same time, with the real risk of a military-approved candidate winning free presidential elections, a mixed system with a powerful president comes with its own pitfalls. The real battle for Egypt may no longer be on the streets of Cairo but, rather, within its institutions. This new phase will be defined by a precarious balancing act between different power centers, each with its own distinct sources of legitimacy. The military will continue to call on its history as ""protector of the nation"" and, now, ""protector of the revolution."" But the Parliament will be the only nationally elected body that can claim to represent the will of the people. If the turnout figures are indeed high, as preliminary reports indicate, then the Parliament can claim an even stronger popular mandate. This struggle for power will be just as meaningful -- and likely much more contentious -- than the elections that preceded it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shadi Hamid.","Shadi Hamid: Egypt election seems a success despite street protests the week before .
He says real problem looms when elected Parliament and military council vie for power .
He says Muslim Brotherhood wants pure parliamentary system; this comes with pitfalls .

"(CNN) -- A powerful and dangerous Bering Sea storm prepared to slam Alaska's west coast late Tuesday, bringing a brutal mix of high seas, blizzard conditions and strong winds, the National Weather Service said. Sustained winds in some areas are expected to reach up to hurricane-force levels of 75 and 80 miles per hour, with higher gusts possible, meteorologist Stephen Kearney told CNN. Nome, with a population of about 3,700, will endure sea levels 7 to 8 feet above normal, with occasional 10-foot waves, he said. Chip Leeper, incident commander with the Nome government, said people in low-lying areas and on the edges of a sea wall are being advised to seek shelter elsewhere. There were no mandatory evacuations late Tuesday. While the town was taking the matter seriously, residents were taking things in stride. ""Most people are a hardy lot,"" Leeper told CNN. ""We don't scare easy."" Forecasters said the storm would cross the Chukotsk Peninsula and take a northwestern track into the Chukchi Sea on Wednesday. Widespread flooding and severe beach erosion are expected in several areas, including Norton Sound. While fall storms happen, this one has officials particularly concerned because of the anticipated coastal flooding. Usually, the less-populated Aleutian Islands to the south are most affected. The U.S. Coast Guard said it had moved helicopters into positions to assist. ""We are prestaging helicopters from Air Station Kodiak to parts of Western Alaska in response to severe weather advisories, including hurricane force winds and high seas that are forecast all along the west coast of Alaska,"" said Capt. Daniel Travers, Coast Guard District 17 chief of incident management. A 143-foot fishing trawler, Rebecca Irene, had lost an engine in the Bering Sea and Coast Guard crews were preparing to remove non-essential personnel, the Coast Guard said in a statement . The mayor of Point Hope, an Inupait village, told CNN Fairbanks affiliate KTVF the community was prepared. Mayor Steve Oomittuck said, if necessary, everyone in the village of about 700 will go to the school, which sits on higher ground.","National Weather Service tracks major storm in Bering Sea .

"Montgomery, Alabama (CNN) -- Alabama's attorney general questioned Wednesday whether the federal government has the legal right to ask for data from school districts in the state, which has recently passed controversial legislation intended to reduce illegal immigration. In a letter sent Wednesday, Attorney General Luther Strange said he was ""perplexed and troubled"" about a request from the Justice Department for information about Alabama's schools. The Justice Department issued the letter Tuesday to Alabama school districts to ensure they are complying with federal law, which declares that a child may not be denied equal access to schools based on his or her immigration status. Strange's letter noted that the law was still being litigated. Strange set a Friday noon deadline for Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for DOJ's civil rights division, to provide the legal authority for his request. Last spring, the Alabama legislature passed the law known as HB 56 relating to illegal immigration and a federal judge allowed most of its provisions to go into effect, including a mandate for public schools to ask about the immigration status of students enrolling in the system. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit granted the Justice Department's request for an emergency injunction for that section of the law but allowed other controversial parts to continue being enforced. Justice urges Alabama schools' compliance on immigrant laws . The Alabama Department of Education sent a memorandum to school districts recommending they wait for resolution of the issue between the state attorney and Justice Department before responding to the DOJ request. In the days following the implementation of HB 56, the number of Latino students skipping class spiked. Malissa Valdes, communication manager for the Alabama Department of Education, said the number of Latino absentees has since leveled off but remains several hundred higher than normal. The Department of Education also released enrollment numbers for the current school year showing an overall decrease in the student population but a 2.8 percent increase in Latino students, who represent some 35,000 of the state's 740,000 students. Valdes said the state tried to inform the districts of possible changes related to HB 56 while stressing that no student should be denied enrollment regardless of legal status. ""If everyone sticks exactly to what the law asks from them and they don't go beyond, then there should not be any danger to the education of all students that are welcomed, no matter what,"" Valdes said. Allison Neal, the American Civil Liberties Union's legal director in Alabama, said she is happy the Justice Department is asking state educators to do what they can to prevent Latino students from becoming discouraged about attending school. ""We want to make sure students have the right to their education,"" Neal said. Valdes said the state sent letters to the schools and to students' parents before and after the law was enacted to prevent confusion. The ACLU declined to comment on Strange's response to the DOJ request. Officials at Birmingham City Schools have tried to encourage parents to keep their children in our schools and have told them their children would not be affected by the immigration law, said Michaelle Chapman, the schools' director of communications, in a statement. ""On the heels of the court decision allowing the law to go into effect, we sent an automated call to all parents explaining that no information would be collected regarding children who already were enrolled. The call went out in Spanish to our Latino families."" The Montgomery School District sent Spanish-speaking teachers to areas with large numbers of Latinos to encourage the families to continue to send their kids to school. At Evergreen Estates, a mobile home park on the outskirts of Montgomery, parents awaiting the return of their kids from school said they were not aware that some parents were keeping their children home out of fear of the law. A Guatemalan woman in the United States without legal papers said she had left from Georgia with her eighth-grade son when the state started talking about a similar law and was considering leaving Alabama, too. ""I hear they are looking for farm workers in Florida,"" she said. But, she added, she had never considered taking her child out of school. Valdes said the number of students withdrawn from state schools will not be known for months because the schools have not received official notification from the families about permanently removing their kids. She said the department will continue to work to ensure all children in Alabama continue to be educated. ""We are here to educate the children but have to follow every law that is passed and active,"" Valdes said.

"Mosi-oa-Tunya, Zambia (CNN) -- ""Stop the car, stop the car! There's a bull elephant in the road!"" Words I listen to closely as they're being shouted by a man sitting next to me clutching an AK-47. His name is John, a park ranger protecting myself and the CNN crew as we venture through the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in Zambia for ""Inside Africa."" We jump out of the car, cameras rolling; he tells me villagers nearby have complained of a rogue male elephant storming through, damaging crops -- this may be him. Just 25 meters separate us and the elephant's enormous tusks. The magnificent animal stands defiantly at approximately three meters tall or more. It sees us but refuses to move, instead continuing to pull down branches, eat leaves and take his time. We don't know how long he will remain calm and we certainly won't challenge or disturb him, so we find another way out. Discovering the real Zambia . It was an incredible stroke of luck to find a peaceful bull elephant and get so close, especially since we were leaving after many fruitful hours of a walking safari. This park is part of a UNESCO World Heritage site that includes Victoria Falls, so the semi-wild animals here are protected by armed rangers like John. He walked with me as we discovered beautifully striped zebras and stood in front of me as three dozen buffalo caught our scent and moved aggressively our way. John then took me to a distant part of the of park to show me something the rangers are extremely proud of; their white rhinos. As we approach their grazing area, stepping over bushes, pushing branches aside, I could feel my heart racing. Then, all of a sudden, quietly and without ceremony, two rhinos appeared; a mother and her 12-month-old baby. They're shorter than I expect but much wider too, mud drying on their rough skin after a hot summer's day. The ranger tells me the mother, they've named ""Inonge,"" was brought here from South Africa, where poachers are pushing one type of white rhino to extinction. They're here in an effort to reintroduce the animals to natural surroundings and hopefully increase their numbers. It's a surreal feeling to be quietly occupying the same shaded space as such important creatures. Dramatic elephant rescue . Now I understand why the rangers are gushing over ""Hope,"" the baby. It's the first of its kind born at the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park and represents a Zambian success story. It also shows the extent to which locals truly care about preserving the natural wonders that surround them. I saw the same level of appreciation along the banks of the mighty Zambezi river, meeting Zambians who literally live and work in the ""mist that thunders."" I approach one woman among a group of families enjoying the cool waters; her name is Mary and she is all smiles. Her baby is also called Hope and is staring at me curiously, peeking over Mary's shoulder. Meeting two babies called Hope, it strikes me how optimistic Zambians are about the future. I discover that Mary and Hope are from northern Zambia, making their first trip to Victoria Falls together. She tells me it's a privilege to be able to come down to Victoria Falls, bask in the waters and socialize with the other parents. Elsewhere, I meet a group of young men, snapping pictures of the massive waterfalls with their small cell phones. While talking with them I find that they're construction workers building a brand new ticketing office on the Zambian side of the main bridge over the Zambezi. This is their after-work stroll along what's described as the most magnificent waterfall in the world. See Errol bungee jump at Victoria Falls . The men live in camping tents while working on the new building yet seem proud of their situation. One even tells me Zambians are ""blessed people"" and therefore it's their responsibility to maintain the natural attractions. It wasn't a salesperson's pitch, or a canned, prepared response, it was genuine expression of appreciation that people from all corners of the globe come to their home. At this point I realize the encounters with wildlife were sublime but it was listening to people and their stories that really resonated with me. Hours walking with John the ranger, moments chatting along the Zambezi with Mary and her baby and talking to what seemed to be sensitive construction workers. They all represent typical Zambia in some way, and I cannot get over the fact that my job is to meet these kinds of people all over the African continent. My thrilling time here has come to an end, and next I'll take you to Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa.

"(CNN) -- Apple rivals Google and Samsung said Friday that they have canceled the launch of a new smartphone next week to honor the death of Steve Jobs. The press announcement for the Android phone was set for Tuesday at a wireless industry trade show in San Diego, but representatives from Google and Samsung decided Thursday night, a day after the Apple co-founder's death, that they would postpone the event, Samsung spokesman Kim Titus said in a phone interview. ""We just felt that it wasn't the right time to make a major product announcement while the world is still paying tribute to Steve Jobs,"" Titus said. ""There's never been such an iconic figure in our industry pass away before."" A Google spokesman said in a statement: ""We believe this is not the right time to announce a new product as the world expresses tribute to Steve Jobs' passing."" He added that the development is on schedule. Titus also said the product is on track and that the delay is related only to Jobs' death. Google and Samsung were expected to showcase a new Nexus phone with a curved glass screen, which would be the first to run a next-generation version of Android called Ice-Cream Sandwich. They have not set a new date for the news conference, Titus said. Titus acknowledged that Apple and its partners are carrying on in the wake of Jobs' death. Apple and its cellular operators began selling pre-orders for the iPhone 4S on Friday. Sprint Nextel, the newest carrier for the iPhone, announced Friday that its next-generation 4G network will debut in 120 cities by the end of next year. ""Under the current circumstances, both parties have agreed that this is not the appropriate time for the announcement of a new product,"" Titus said in a statement to reporters and clients. Despite Jobs' public disparagement of Apple rivals, executives from Google and Samsung voiced only condolences after the technology pioneer's death. Google CEO Larry Page expressed his sadness at the news and said Jobs had always been an inspiration to him. He also revealed that a sick Jobs offered Page advice earlier this year when Page took over as CEO from Eric Schmidt, a former Apple board member. Sergey Brin said he and his co-founder, Page, had admired Jobs' ""vision and leadership"" skills. In comments on Apple earnings calls and at conferences, Jobs described Android as a flawed, fragmented system and lamented about how Google, once a close partner, decided to compete with Apple. In a string of legal disputes around the world, Apple and Samsung have traded assertions that they copied the other's inventions, and both companies are trying to block the sale of each other's gadgets. After Jobs' death, Samsung CEO Choi Gee-Sung said in a statement: ""Steve Jobs introduced numerous revolutionary changes to the information technology industry and was a great entrepreneur. His innovative spirit and remarkable accomplishments will forever be remembered by people around the world."" Similar statements came from other Apple competitors that Jobs had waged public wars with in the past, including Microsoft, Nokia, Research in Motion and Sony.","Google and Samsung say they canceled an event in honor of Steve Jobs' death .

"(CNN) -- A 52-year-old cruiserweight who spent 26 years in prison for a murder he did not commit won his professional boxing debut Saturday night. Dewey Bozella defeated Larry Hopkins by unanimous decision in the four-round match at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The pugilist served time in New York's Sing Sing prison after being found guilty of murder in 1983; his conviction was overturned two years ago. According to a biography on his website, Bozella was offered several opportunities for an early release if he would admit guilt and show remorse. ""Anger at his imprisonment gave way to determination and instead of becoming embittered, he became a model prisoner"" and earned several degrees, the site says. President Barack Obama called Bozella this week, offering him encouragement in his fight. During his incarceration, Bozella was crowned the Sing Sing heavyweight champion. The main event Saturday night features Bernard Hopkins, 46, who first became a world champion 16 years ago. The American boxer made history in May when he was awarded a points victory over Canadian Jean Pascal to become the sport's oldest-ever holder of a global belt. The World Boxing Council (WBC) light heavyweight champion was to defend his title against Chad Dawson late Saturday. Hopkins is significantly older than his opponent. Dawson, currently ranked by Ring Magazine as the fourth-best light heavyweight in the world, is 29, 17 years younger than the Pennsylvania-born Hopkins. Bozella's story resonated with Hopkins, who served a five-year stretch in Graterford Prison in Pennsylvania between 1983 and 1988. So impressed was Hopkins with Bozella that he trained with the newcomer ahead of his much-anticipated fight. ""It inspired me,"" said Hopkins of Bozella. ""He chose to do what he did, and not only did he get freedom, but he got humanity. An opportunity to do something that was taken from him years and years ago. To be on a major, major fight card. ""And now that we became, I can say friends, and have understanding about that dark place that I put myself in, you know, I wasn't innocent. But we still understand that dark place. Everybody has a story, but his is beyond a story.""","NEW: Dewey Bozella, 52, defeated Larry Hopkins by unanimous decision .

"(CNN) -- Just imagine, for a moment, a world in which Steve Jobs had never lived. How might daily life be different? Computers are still around, but not as you know them. They're complex, hateful things, mostly used in the office for spreadsheets and other business applications. Nobody bothered to sell a good-looking user interface with a desktop and mouse, because nobody could be sure there was a mass market for it. Thousands of people use PCs at home, but they're mostly hobbyists and amateur programmers. If you want to have fun with electronics, you hook up a videogame console to your TV. The Internet still exists, but it never really had as much of a platform to take root on. There's a thriving market in trading MP3s online, but all of it is illegal. The record labels never got their act together on selling digital copies of songs. MP3 players are large, clunky things with too many buttons. No movie studio makes really good computer-animated films. Smartphones are bulky bricks with thick keyboards. Touchscreen tablets exist -- as prototypes in a few computer labs. Okay, so maybe things wouldn't have been quite that bad without Jobs. Perhaps Xerox PARC's management would have figured out it was sitting on a goldmine in its Graphical User Interface and early-model mouse. Microsoft might have come up with Windows without the example of the Macintosh. Maybe Steve Wozniak would have found another compadre to help him design, sell and market the Apple II, the PC that started it all. But none of that seems very likely. Many words have been written attempting to distill the magic of Steve Jobs. To my mind, it boils down to this: He saved technology from itself. He stopped it from being scary to a mass audience. He took the excitement and optimism that Silicon Valley already felt about computing, and never ceased to find new ways to communicate that to the world. For all of his celebration of crazy revolutionaries who liked to ""think different,"" Jobs was a champion of the mainstream. His business idols, he liked to say, were the Beatles. That wasn't just because the way their four personalities balanced each other was a good model for management. It was also because what they made was accessible -- and enjoyed by everyone on the planet. I've written about my experiences interviewing Jobs for Time magazine here, but the first time I ever spoke to him was a prime example of his mainstream approach. This was shortly after his return to Apple, in an interview for a now-defunct supplement called Time Digital. After a handful questions, Jobs suddenly lost his temper. ""I know hundreds of people who read Time Magazine,"" he fumed. ""I don't know anyone who reads Time Digital."" With that, the interview was over. Thankfully, we had dozens of pleasant encounters after that. But I would always understand that he knew exactly who he was talking to, and that he was always laser-focused on reaching as wide a readership as he could. He gave great quotes -- quotes that didn't talk down to the reader, but rather let them peek behind the scenes at Apple. ""The dirty little secret of the iTunes store is that there's no way to make money,"" he told me when it launched on the PC. ""We do it because we're selling iPods."" iPods, iPhones, iPads -- Jobs had his product road map worked out way in advance, and it was all about getting supremely easy-to-use products into the hands of as many users as possible. Compromised, committee-designed devices, such as the ho-hum Motorola Rockr iTunes phone, only served as examples of what Apple shouldn't make. So what now? Is there another visionary in the world with that kind of drive, ambition, focus and zeal? Plenty of pundits have said we'll never see the likes of Jobs again -- but I hope they're wrong, and I think Jobs would hope that too. Because who wants to see a world without the mid-21st century equivalent of the Macintosh, or the iPod, or Pixar? If someone does pick up that baton and champion mainstream-friendly, fear-free technology, think where we'll go next. Just imagine. © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- At least 12 Chinese sailors have been killed after their cargo ships were attacked on the Mekong River in the northern Thai province of Chiang Rai, the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Yunnan Province has said. The ministry's website stated that two Chinese cargo ships -- the Hua Ping and Yu Xing 8 -- were attacked with gunfire on October 5. According to the initial investigation, all six sailors from Hua Ping and six of the seven sailors from Yu Xing 8 were found dead, while one remained missing. Though still in the early stages of their investigation, Thai police say they cannot rule out the involvement of drug gangs in the killings. Chiang Rai police colonel Popkorn Khuncharoensuk told CNN that the two ships were raided by a joint task force of army, marine police, local police and paramilitary following the attack, and found almost one million amphetamines on the vessels. ""This is the most gruesome incident I have ever seen,"" Popkorn said. According to Popkorn, one of the bodies was found aboard the Hua Ping, while the rest were found in the Mekong River near Chiangsaen port. Three of the bodies remained unidentified, and some were found with their hands cuffed or tied. ""I can't rule out all possibilities, but initially there appears to be drugs involved,"" Popkorn said. ""But we can't just quickly jump to the conclusion that it was carried out by drug gangs. The case is complicated, and we have to be very thorough."" The violent incident has unnerved many of those who ply their trade on the river. ""There are no cargo ships leaving or coming to Chiangsaen port,"" said Surachart Janthawatcharakorn, Chief of Chiangsaen Customs Office. ""They have all halted their traveling because they are still frightened by the incident, and are still very concerned about their safety."" The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the Chinese Embassy in Thailand and its consulate general in Chiang Mai were investigating the murders and were working closely with Thai authorities and other relevant countries to hunt down the criminals. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Haolan Hong contributed to this report.","Two Chinese ships were attacked on the Mekong River on October 5 .

"Detroit (CNN) -- The judge in the federal trial of alleged ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab refused Tuesday to prevent the prosecution from calling the device he allegedly carried a ""bomb."" U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds also refused to exclude a photo of AbdulMutallab's burned genitals from the evidence. Before the prosecution began its opening statement, defense standby counsel Anthony Chambers asked that the prosecutors not be allowed to use the words ""explosive device"" or ""bomb"" during the trial. It's up to the jury to decide whether the device AbdulMutallab was carrying was a bomb, Chambers argued. ""I'm going to deny that motion,"" responded Edmunds. ""It makes no sense whatsoever."" As for the photo, the judge said it did not seem ""unusually prejudicial."" AbdulMutallab, accused of trying to detonate an explosive device in his underwear aboard a Christmas 2009 flight to Detroit, has said he will represent himself. The prosecution delivered a 90-minute opening statement. The defense said it would reserve the right to give an opening statement at a later point in the trial in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. At one point, AbdulMutallab joined the attorneys for a sidebar with the judge. While at previous court appearances AbdulMutallab has had outbursts -- including yelling ""Osama's alive,"" a reference to Osama bin Laden, according to a court official -- he remained calm Tuesday. AbdulMutallab wore a traditional African gown, gray with gold-colored braiding. AbdulMutallab was indicted on charges including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism, and possession of a firearm or destructive device in furtherance of an act of violence. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route from the Netherlands to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. U.S. officials say the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the alleged bombing attempt. Jonathan Tukel, chief of the National Security Unit for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Michigan, laid out details of the flight in his opening statement. Passengers were from 26 different countries, most of them American and Dutch, he said. ""Everyone had someplace to be. All but one."" Pointing to AbdulMutallab, Tukel said, ""His sole reason for being on Flight 253 was to kill all of the passengers and himself. He thought he'd end up in heaven."" After taking numerous trips to the bathroom, AbdulMutallab went back to the bathroom about an hour before the plane was to land, ""to purify himself to die,"" Tukel said. AbdulMutallab did not eat or drink on the plane, a fast that was part of ritual purification, Tukel said. A witness testified that AbdulMutallab was in the bathroom for about 15 to 20 minutes, which seemed long to the passenger, Tukel said. When AbdulMutallab returned to his seat, he pulled a blanket over his head, ""pushed the plunger on the bomb and prepared to die,"" Tukel said. Passengers heard a loud noise, which sounded like a firecracker, Tukel said. AbdulMutallab became enveloped in a fireball which then spread to the wall and carpeting of the plane, yet he remained in his seat ""expressionless, completely blank,"" Tukel said. Four passengers helped subdue him and tried to put out the fire, Tukel said, and AbdulMutallab was escorted up to first class. When a flight attendant asked him what he had in his pockets, he called it ""an explosive device,"" Tukel said. Tukel added that AbdulMutallab was very verbal and spoke with many people, including some on the flight and officials once the flight landed. The prosecution also called its first witness Tuesday, Michael Zantow, who was on the flight one row behind AbdulMutallab. Zantow, a 20-year veteran of the Army, was among those who tried to restrain the defendant. Within a minute of the loud sound on the plane, a passenger said to AbdulMutallab, ""Hey man, your pants are on fire!"" Zantow testified. The passenger repeated himself two or three times, and AbdulMutallab did not respond, Zantow said. The jury is made up of three white men and nine women -- six white, two African-American and one Southeast Asian.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A medical marijuana advocacy group sued the Obama administration Thursday, saying its policy ""to subvert local and state medical marijuana laws in California"" is unconstitutional. Americans for Safe Access accused the U.S. Justice Department of deploying aggressive SWAT-style raids, prosecuting medical marijuana patients and providers, and threatening local officials for implement state medical pot laws. The group, a nonprofit based in Oakland, California, that says it's the country's largest medical marijuana advocacy organization, cited U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag of the northern district of California in its federal lawsuit filed in San Francisco. ""Under the Tenth Amendment, the government may not commandeer the law-making function of the state or its subdivisions or indirectly through the selective enforcement of its drug laws,"" the lawsuit said. ""It is this misuse of the government's commerce clause powers, designed to deprive the state of its sovereign ability to chart a separate course, that forms the basis of the plaintiff's claim."" Earlier this month, federal prosecutors in California announced a series of actions targeting what they characterized as the ""large, for-profit marijuana industry"" that has developed since the state legalized medical marijuana for select patients 15 years ago. Four U.S. attorneys -- Benjamin Wagner, Andre Birotte Jr., Laura Duffy and Melinda Haag -- detailed in a joint press release and later a press conference in Sacramento some steps that have been taken in conjunction with federal law enforcement and local officials in California. They include letters of warning to landlords and lien holders of places in which marijuana is being sold illegally, ""civil forfeiture lawsuits against properties involved in drug trafficking activity"" and numerous criminal cases. The latter refers to arrests in recent weeks related to cases filed in federal courts in Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and Fresno, all part of an effort that Wagner claimed has resulted in the seizure of hundreds of pounds of marijuana, tens of thousands of plants and hundreds of thousands in cash. Thursday's lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and was filed on behalf of its 20,000 members in California, the medical marijuana advocacy group said. ""This case is aimed at restoring California's sovereign and constitutional right to establish its own public health laws based on this country's federalist principles,"" the association's chief counsel, Joe Elford, said in a statement. In 1996, California voters approved Proposition 215 to exempt doctors and seriously ill patients from marijuana laws and allow them to grow and use it in treatment. The bill didn't legalize marijuana for all, but it did lead to the emergence of hundreds of dispensaries where people -- legally only those with medical conditions and a doctor's authorization -- could get the drug. In explaining the federal crackdown earlier this month, Wagner, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California, said authorities ""are not focused on backyard grows with small amounts of marijuana by seriously ill people. We are targeting commercial operations, which profit from growing and distributing ... and often use the trappings of state law for cover, but in fact are abusing state law."" Haag, U.S. attorney for California's northern district, claimed that ""profiteers ... motivated not by compassion, but by money"" had ""hijacked"" the intent of voters to help those suffering from debilitating conditions. And Birotte, from California's central district, said a chief problem lies in operations that make money not by selling marijuana to the sick, but to relatively healthy people. CNN's Rich Porter and Erica Henry contributed to this story.","Americans for Safe Access sues the feds for their California crackdown on medical pot .

"(EW.com) -- ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" features one of the more soul-destroying death orgies in Fantasy-lit history, with a whole cavalcade of Potter supporting players winding up as casualties in the climactic wizard battle. The series never shrank from death -- Books 4 through 6 each end with a major character dying, and the whole saga begins with Harry as a newly orphaned baby. But in a new special feature on the ""Deathly Hallows 2"" DVD, author J. K. Rowling notes that she'd planned one fatality that would have probably scarred a generation of young readers. As reported by the Guardian, Rowling says, ""I did seriously consider killing Ron."" Apparently, she briefly thought about killing off Harry's red-headed sidekick around the middle of the series, when she ""wasn't in a very happy place."" It's an interesting piece of what-might-have-been trivia. In some ways, it reminds me a little bit of the mythic notion that Han Solo was supposed to die in Return of the Jedi -- an idea which was supported by original Star Wars producer Gary Kurtz and Harrison Ford. Kurtz told the Hollywood Reporter that Solo lived because George Lucas didn't want to kill off any of his main characters. It's hard to accuse Rowling of any such anxiety, given the ""Deathly Hallows"" bloodbath. Still, it's fun to speculate on how such a major change would have altered the book series. Rowling doesn't specify in what context she was picturing Ron's death, but it's easy to imagine that he might have bit the dust relatively early. Lots of people were shocked when Rowling killed off Cedric Diggory in ""Goblet of Fire,"" but Diggory was a minor character who, in hindsight, was always kind of a handsome readymade corpse -- think of how much freakier the latter Potters would have felt without good ol' Ron around to relieve the tension. Conversely, imagine if Ron had sacrificed himself in Deathly Hallows' climax. It certainly would have changed the tone of the ending, which was a pretty upbeat Happily Ever After, all considering.

"(CNN) -- As South Carolina Republicans begin voting in the first primary of the south today, GOP insiders say that all the candidates have had their problems in Palmetto State, one reason why today's outcome has been so hard to predict. One veteran South Carolina GOP operative summed up the dilemma of many of his colleagues in the state who are still on the fence. ""For the first time in my professional life I am not working for a candidate and undecided on whom I will vote for. My heart says one thing, my mind says another."" According to a CNN survey of 46 South Carolina GOP insiders -- including state legislators, state and local party officials, business and conservative interest group leaders, veterans of previous presidential primary campaigns, Palmetto State GOP political consultants, and other party activists -- former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's biggest hurdles in South Carolina are his Massachusetts political roots and his more centrist views. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich calls Romney a ""Massachusetts moderate."" What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Romney in South Carolina? His record in Massachusetts -- 85% . His Mormon faith -- 13% . His role at Bain Capital -- 2% . Now that Romney wants the GOP presidential nomination again, he has moved to the right from some of his positions and the tone of his previous campaigns in the state. And that has fed the perception that Romney is willing to change his stands for political expediency. Ironically, Romney's continued defense of the Massachusetts health care reform law he helped enact as governor remains a stumbling block with some conservatives who would rather he repent on that issue. ""The two big issues that stick out to me regarding his record are his flip-flopping on abortion which many voters in South Carolina don't understand, and of course his signing of 'Romney-care,' "" said one South Carolina insider. ""As a result, many don't trust him and wonder if he will simply say anything in order to win the election."" And while Gingrich maintains that he's the logical alternative for conservatives, the former House Speaker's problem has been that, up until Thursday, there were two other options for South Carolina voters who were uneasy with Romney -- former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Texas Gov Rick Perry, who has since suspended his campaign. However, the insiders don't think Gingrich's personal issues have played as much of a factor, although they were surveyed before reports surfaced on January 19 that Gingrich's second wife said he asked her for an ""open marriage."" What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Gingrich in South Carolina? Conservative vote is too divided among candidates -- 52% . Attacks against Romney's role at Bain Capital backfired -- 33% . The negative ads run against him -- 13% . Personal baggage (volunteered) -- 2% . ""Newt's populism resonates with red-meat voters in South Carolina, but the Romney-alternative field (has been) too crowded for him to lock down a solid win here,"" said one GOP insider. The other main contender for the fervent conservative vote in South Carolina has been Santorum and he shares Gingrich's problem of being one of too many choice on the right. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Santorum in South Carolina? His past record as senator on earmarks and right-to-work -- 41% . Conservative vote is too divided among candidates -- 56% . Doubts about him among Southern voters -- 2% . ""The biggest obstacle for all the 'not-Romney' candidates has been in a word, 'ego,' "" said one GOP Insider. ""All of their egos were too big to drop out (early) and work to truly consolidate conservative voters."" But another operative noted that in a state where the Republican governor had battled with the Obama administration over whether Boeing could move airplane production from assembly lines that were unionized in Washington State to a nonunion facility in South Carolina, Santorum's defense of his opposition to right-to-work laws while he was a senator has been ""awkward, at best."" Texas Rep. Ron Paul's liability in South Carolina has been the same as in Iowa and New Hampshireâ€”his isolationist views on foreign policy and his eagerness to cut military spending. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Paul in South Carolina? His stance on national security -- 78% . He didn't spend enough time in the state -- 20% . Perception that he can't win in the general election -- 2% . ""Because of this and other stands, no one takes him seriously outside of his hard-core supporters,"" said one GOP Insider. The CNN South Carolina GOP insiders were surveyed on these questions from the evening of Jan. 16 thru Jan. 18. The survey was conducted over the internet. The South Carolina insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers in order to encourage candid responses. And while some insiders were aligned with one or another of the presidential campaigns, two-thirds said they had neither endorsed nor were they working for any candidate in the race. Here are the names of the participants in the survey: Eric Bedingfield, Peter Brown, Kevin Bryant, Luke Byars, Drea Byars, Chris Carino, Phillip Cease, Alan Clemmons, Chad Connelley, Wesley Donehue, Shannon Erickson, Justin Evans, Scott Farmer, Chip Felkel, Becky Fleming, Douglas Ford, Greg Foster, Mark Harmon, Wes Hayes, Allen Klump, Scott Malyerck, Janice McCord, Joe McKeown, Drew McKissick, Ed McMullen, Matt Moore, Matthew Nichols, Mark Nix, Ralph Norman, Randy Page, Sunny Philips, Mike Pitts, Tommy Pope, Richard Quinn, Jay W.

"(CNN) -- Two idyllic South Pacific islands are facing a water crisis; they're running out of it, and fast. The island nations Tuvalu and Tokelau have declared states of emergency after six months of little or no rainfall. It's estimated that at the current rate of consumption the Tuvaluan atoll of Funafuti, home to 5,000 people, will run out of drinking water in two weeks. Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand with a population of 1,500, could run dry in just one. ""We are all working in line with the fact that we recognize this national emergency situation,"" Jo Suveinakama, the general manager of the Tokelau government told Radio New Zealand. The New Zealand Red Cross flew emergency supplies to Tuvalu Monday on a New Zealand Defense Force flight along with two aid workers and two foreign ministry staff. ""We have mobilized 2,000 collapsible water containers, hand sanitizers, tarpaulins to be used to capture rain (and) two emergency desalination units,"" Andrew McKie, New Zealand Red Cross International Operations and Emergency Manager said in a statement Tuesday. The emergency desalinators are being sent south on a patrol boat at midnight Tuesday to the small atoll of Nukulaelae, part of Tuvalu, whose population of 330 is reported to be down to its last 60 liters of water. Schools have closed as residents conserve what little water they have and pray for rain. ""It's a pretty dire situation there,"" Gareth Smith, New Zealand High Commissioner to Tuvalu told Radio New Zealand. Smith is one of the two foreign ministry staff sent to Tuvalu this week. In Nukulaelae, water is being rationed. Families - some with as many as 10 people - are forced to live on just 40 liters a day, according to Dave Hebblethwaite, a water management adviser from the Applied Geoscience and Technology Division of Secretariat of the Pacific Community. ""Families are getting by washing in the sea and only having a short wash in fresh water if at all,"" he said, adding that most of the fresh water is being reserved for drinking and cooking. The Tuvalu government briefed a group known as the ""Diplomatic Corps"" Tuesday in the Fijian capital of Suva on the type of aid that might be needed. Delegates included head of foreign missions, international agencies and regional organizations. Parts for desalination units and fuel top the list, Hebblethwaite said. Tuvalu, the world's fourth smallest country, is a nation of four reef islands and five atolls covering 26 square kilometers in the Pacific Ocean halfway between Hawaii and Australia. The island nation relies almost exclusively on rainwater collected from the roofs of homes and government buildings to supply a population of 10,000. However, three dry spells over the last three years has gradually drained the community's water supplies. ""Communities in Tuvalu are pretty used to doing it tough,"" Hebblethwaite said. ""Atoll environments are really hard environments to live in and when you're just relying on rainfall for all of your water, you find yourself in situations where you do need to make the most of every small amount. ""For these communities to be asking for external assistance, it shows that the situation is quite serious,"" he said. New Zealand's Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has warned the water crisis could lead to food shortages as crops fail. ""We're now doing an assessment, not just in Tuvalu but also in other areas of the Pacific that are affected by the shortage of rainfall, making sure we deal with the drinking water issue most urgently,"" he told Radio New Zealand. Tuvalu imports the bulk of its food but its people also grow their own crops, mostly taro. The root vegetable is grown in pits filled with organic matter due to the lack of soil available on the atoll. ""We know that on some of the islands, particularly on Nukalaelae, many pits are suffering damage from either drying out or getting saline from the water table. So there's certainly an impact on food security,"" Hebblethwaite said. ""We're even finding that some fruit trees are suffering, even coconuts, which is unusual. Coconut palms on Nukalaelae are starting to lose their fronds,"" he said. Tuvalu has been very vocal in its calls for international help to mitigate the effects of climate change. It has warned that it is in danger of ""sinking"" as sea water levels rise. ""The information we have about climate change and rainfall patterns is getting better and better every month,"" Hebblethwaite said. However he added that assessing long term trends on the islands was difficult to due the lack of rain gauges. ""One thing's for sure, water will be the main mechanism by which climate change impacts on these island communities, whether it be by droughts or by storms or floods,"" he said. ""So building their resistance to today's climate variability that they're experiencing will be a key defense they can employ against the future impacts of climate change, and I think people are recognizing that.""","Tuvalu and Tokelau in the South Pacific running out of drinking water .

"(CNN) -- In their attacks on the food stamp program, some Republican presidential candidates are leaving a deeply misleading impression of the nation's leading anti-hunger program. No one aspires to enroll, but for those who must, it is an essential lifeline that addresses one of the harshest impacts of poverty and unemployment -- hunger. The food stamp program, now officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), provides about 46 million Americans in about 22 million low-income households with debit cards to buy food each month. Participants include families with adults who work in low-wage jobs, unemployed workers and people on fixed incomes, such as Social Security. About three-fourths of SNAP recipients live in households with children; more than one-quarter live in households with seniors or people with disabilities. SNAP reduces poverty while providing people with much-needed help to buy food. The program kept more than 5 million people out of poverty in 2010 and lessened the severity of poverty for millions of others, under a measure of poverty that counts SNAP benefits as income. SNAP is also highly efficient, with one of the most rigorous quality control systems of any public benefit program. In 2010, only 3 percent of payments went to ineligible households or to eligible households in excessive amounts. Payment accuracy has been improving in the past few years, despite a large increase in SNAP enrollment. While some have attributed that enrollment increase to Obama administration policies -- Newt Gingrich has termed President Barack Obama the ""food stamp president"" -- in reality it has two main causes that have little to do with this administration. Millions of people hit by the recession a few years ago became eligible for SNAP. Today's large SNAP caseloads mostly reflect the extraordinarily deep and prolonged recession and the weak recovery that has followed. Long-term unemployment hit record levels in 2010 and has remained extremely high. Today, 43% of all unemployed workers have been out of work for more than half a year; the previous post-World War II high was 26% in 1983. Workers who are unemployed for a long time are more likely to deplete their assets, exhaust unemployment insurance and turn to SNAP for help. It is one of the few safety net programs available to them. In most states, other programs -- such as cash assistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and state General Assistance programs -- have not responded effectively to the rising need brought on by the economy. More than one in five workers who had been unemployed for over six months received SNAP in 2010, according to Congress's Joint Economic Committee. The increase in enrollment is also because it's easier for eligible families to participate. Federal and state officials as well as Congress, with leadership from both parties, have worked throughout the last decade to simplify SNAP procedures so that the program can reach more eligible households, particularly working families and senior citizens. These efforts are paying off: The share of eligible individuals who participated in SNAP rose from 65% in 2007 to 72% in 2009, the most recent year for which we have the data. The recent growth in SNAP enrollment and spending because of the sluggish economy is temporary. One of SNAP's great strengths is its ability to respond, quickly and automatically, to changes in the economy: Enrollment grows during downturns but contracts during periods of economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that SNAP spending will fall in the coming years as the economy recovers more robustly and the temporary benefit increases of the 2009 Recovery Act expire. By 2021, SNAP is expected to return nearly to pre-recession levels as a share of the economy. Over the long term, SNAP is not growing faster than the economy. So it is not contributing to the nation's long-term fiscal problems. A weak economy has swelled the numbers of unemployed workers and poor families. That's a serious problem that our policymakers need to address. In the meantime, SNAP helps protect the most vulnerable from very difficult circumstances.

"Cupertino, California (CNN) -- Tim Cook, Apple's newly appointed CEO, did not introduce a single product on Tuesday. At Cook's first news conference since officially taking over for Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, his team of executives announced a new iPhone, an application for sending greeting cards, and a location-based social network called Find My Friends. But Cook himself did not announce a single thing. To use artistic metaphors, perhaps that's indicative of how Cook sees his role as Apple leader -- not as a sculptor but as an orchestra conductor. Jobs is renowned for his ability to mold the shape of products during their development and for his involvement in seemingly trivial details of the business. He does not hesitate to tell his employees or powerful partners outside the company when he thinks they are wrong and need to rethink products. And, as even those who have been on the receiving end admit, he's usually right. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates once said of Jobs, ""I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste."" Cook, who filled in for Jobs when he had taken medical leaves in past years, opened and closed Tuesday's iPhone 4S presentation alone, a role typically reserved for Jobs. The event was an important exam for Cook, and analysts say he passed. ""I think Tim Cook did fine today,"" said John Jackson, an analyst at Boston-based market research firm CCS Insight, who attended the keynote. ""The bench picks up where Steve left off."" At Apple's developers conference in June, when Jobs was on medical leave and Cook was filling in as interim CEO, Jobs was the first to take the stage. At that event, he unveiled the ambitious iCloud Internet service and then concluded the keynote. On Tuesday, however, Eddy Cue, who was Cook's first top-level executive appointment since becoming chief, handled the iCloud segment. Cook, Apple's longtime operating chief before rising to CEO, has had limited stage experience. He appeared in New York earlier this year for a Verizon Wireless news conference where the U.S. cellular giant announced that it would start carrying the iPhone. Tuesday was Cook's first test on his home turf. Although some observers on Twitter griped during the event about a lack of eye-popping news, Cook appeared comfortable and confident. He recited his lines flawlessly, and cracked jokes about iPads making planes more fuel-efficient, which elicited hearty laughs. (However, Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing exec, drew the most laughs when describing the improved camera on the iPhone 4S and how hard it was to get a squirrel to stand still for a photo shoot.) Apple's fall announcements are typically held at a convention center in San Francisco and focus heavily on new iPods, but this one took place in a small auditorium on Apple's campus here, which limited the size of the crowd. ""It's sort of like inviting you into our home,"" Cook said to a crowd of reporters, analysts and executives. ""Just 10 years ago, we launched the original iPod here, and it went on to revolutionize the way we listen to music."" In between discussing Apple Store openings in China and explaining sales and market share data, Cook made several comments that seemed humble and personal. ""I consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have worked here for 14 years and am very excited about this new role,"" he said at the outset. And he closed with, ""I am so incredibly proud of this company."" The amount of preparation and rehearsal that went into Cook's onstage arrangement was evident, said Gartner analyst Michael King, who did not attend the event but followed along from Washington. ""I actually thought it was a little more crisp than a Jobs presentation,"" he said. ""Less story time, more presentation. It was extremely well timed."" The first row of seating in the room was filled with Apple execs, with one obvious omission. Jobs, who is now an Apple director and chairman of its board of directors, was nowhere in sight and was not mentioned once during the presentation, though his presence was felt. The experience was different with Cook taking center stage, but not drastically. ""Certainly, the tone was different,"" Jackson said. ""It does herald a certain cultural shift at Apple. These events aren't going to be the same as they ever were."" ""It's not going to be the Steve Jobs show that generates headlines worldwide,"" he added. Apple has carefully crafted the persona of Jobs in recent years as a visionary who is dynamic, charismatic and likable, said Sasha Strauss, a director for consulting firm Innovation Protocol. While Apple works its marketing magic on Cook, the company and its leader will need to figure out what role he should serve in the public eye. Maybe Cook is well-positioned to conduct an orchestra of Apple's key supporting players. But will the company's product launches continue to make the same splash without a superstar?","New Apple CEO Tim Cook passed his first test as presenter, analysts say .

"(CNN) -- Authorities will have to await a necropsy to find out killed one of the equine world's top athletes, a stallion named Hickstead.

The Dutch Warmblood stallion completed the 13-track show jumping course and collapsed on the ground under his rider, the reigning Olympic champion and world number one Eric Lamaze. As shocked fans watched, Hickstead lay shaking on the ground for several minutes before he died. A dazed Eric Lamaze was then led out of the ring. Officials stopped the competition at the request of the riders.

"New York (CNN) -- A pretrial hearing is scheduled for Friday in the case of a former Rutgers University student who allegedly used a web cam to stream footage of his roommate's sexual encounter with another man. Dharun Ravi faces a 15-count indictment, which includes hate crime charges, in connection with the death of his roommate , Tyler Clementi. Clementi killed himself after the incident, jumping from the George Washington Bridge between New York and New Jersey. Last month, Ravi turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time. ""You want to know why he's rejected the plea?"" his attorney, Steven Altman, said in December. ""Simple principle of law, simple principle of life -- he's innocent. He's not guilty.""Ravi is a citizen of India who was studying in the U.S. legally. The deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors would have required Ravi, 19, to undergo 600 hours of community service, counseling and to dispose of any information that could identify the man that Clementi was with. Prosecutors also offered to help Ravi avoid deportation, though they said they could not guarantee it. A second student charged in the scandal, Molly Wei, 19, reached a plea deal and that requires her testify against Ravi. In May, Wei pleaded not guilty to two counts of invasion of privacy, according to a statement from the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office. Less than a month after Clementi's suicide, President Barack Obama released a taped video message condemning bullying.","Dharun Ravi will go to trial in February over a 15-count indictment involving hate crime charges .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai appeared to endorse talks between the United States and the Taliban that could lead to the opening of a Taliban liaison office in Qatar. Karzai's announcement Wednesday followed news a day earlier from the Taliban that it tentatively agreed to open an office in Qatar's capital city of Doha to facilitate talks on the Afghan conflict. It appears to be the first time the Taliban -- who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001, when they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion -- have offered talks without the condition of an American withdrawal from the country. ""Afghanistan, to save the country from war, conspiracies, the killing of innocent Afghans and to reach peace, agrees with the talks between United States of America and Taliban that will end up in establishing an office for Taliban in Qatar,"" Karzai said in a palace statement. In the statement, Karzai appeared to broadly endorse peace negotiations for a country that has been embroiled in more than 30 years of war. It was unclear what, if any, outcome there would be in talks between the United States and the Taliban as Karzai, top Afghan peace officials and the Americans have all previously said that talks had to take place between Afghans. ""The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan with an emphasize on its firm position yet again, believes that talks and negotiation are the only way to reach peace and to come out of the atmosphere of war and imposed violence on Afghan nation,"" the palace statement said. Recent media reports have said the United States and other foreign governments with a stake in the Afghan war may try to strike a separate deal with the Taliban. The Washington Post reported in December that the Obama administration reached a tentative deal with Taliban negotiators that would have included the transfer of five Afghans from Guantanamo Bay, and the Taliban's public renunciation of international terrorism. The deal collapsed, the Post said, because of Karzai's objections. Any talk of a peace process slowed in September, when suicide bombers killed senior Afghan peace negotiator and former President Burhannudin Rabbani. Ismail Qassemyar, a member of Afghanistan's High Peace Council has called peace talks ""an Afghan process"" and warned against the United States or other nations trying to strike their own peace deal with the group. Qassemyar said a Taliban office in Qatar would by no means legitimize the Islamist group. Karzai told CNN in December that the government cannot hold talks until the Islamic militia identifies a representative with the authority to negotiate.","Karzai appears to endorse opening of Taliban office in Qatar .

Recent reports say the U.S. and others may want to strike a peace deal with the Taliban ."
"New York (CNN) -- A spirited and leaderless protest in the Wall Street section of New York has entered its third week, helping to inspire a growing number of demonstrations united in their passion if not necessarily their reasons for hitting the streets. The hub of the movement, in Lower Manhattan, was abuzz with activity on Sunday as activists continued to vent their frustrations with everything from ""corporate greed"" to high gas prices to insufficient health insurance. No single group or person heads the effort, which has adopted the name ""Occupy Wall Street."" While a ""general assembly"" is held daily for those gathered -- be it for a few short hours or by camping out long-term -- to discuss the goings-on and work toward a common mission, the stances being touted currently are diverse. ""We've gathered here in this place ... to shape a statement of what it is we want, and how we're going to get to it,"" said Robert Segal, one of the New York protesters. Video: Police arrest hundreds of protesters in NYC . The lack of coherent message has not stopped similar efforts from popping up elsewhere in the United States. ""Occupy Chicago,"" for instance, entered its 10th day on Sunday, a day after an associated website touted ""a huge afternoon march."" The motto atop a website for ""Occupy Los Angeles,"" which kicked off Saturday with a march from Pershing Square to City Hall, reads: ""The revolution is happening ... It's just not in the news."" There are 34 organizations -- from unions to ethnic organizations to activist groups focused on everything from foreclosure prevention to climate change to justice-related issues -- listed as being involved in a like-minded activist coalition in Boston. This group, which held a festival and march Friday and Saturday and has explicitly targeted Bank of America in recent weeks, states on its website that its aim is to ""stop their greed,"" ""fight for an economy that works for all of us"" and ""build cities that are democratic, just and sustainable."" The website of Seattle demonstrators describes the nationwide effort as ""a leaderless resistance movement with people of many colors, genders and political persuasions."" ""The one thing we all have in common is that We Are The 99% that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1%,"" the statement continues, referring to what it sees as a sharp divide between the wealthiest Americans and the rest of society. Most demonstrations thus far have been peaceful and uneventful, though in a few cases they have led to numerous arrests. The most high-profile such incident came Saturday, when New York police arrested more than 700 protesters who had occupied the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. They were cited for blocking the roadway, authorities said, and eventually released after being given tickets. The confrontation came as protesters along the road banged drums and chanted, ""The whole world is watching"" as police moved in. Paul J. Browne, the deputy commissioner for the New York City Police Department, said they were given ""multiple warnings"" to stay on the pedestrian walkway and not the main roadway. The incident led to a shutdown of Manhattan-to-Brooklyn bridge traffic for several hours. Demonstrators have said they take their inspiration from the Arab Spring protests that swept through Africa and the Middle East this year. The protest campaign -- which uses the hashtag #occupywallstreet on the microblogging site Twitter -- began in July with the launch of a simple campaign website calling for a march and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange. It has gained steam since early September, with crowds taking up residence in a park in New York's financial district and calling for 20,000 people to flood the area for a ""few months."" In recent weeks, the New York demonstrators have addressed various issues, including police brutality, union busting and the economy. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Jordana Ossad contributed to this report.","A park in Lower Manhattan is crowded with ""Occupy Wall Street"" protesters .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Allied forces suffered a day of heavy losses in Afghanistan Friday after a helicopter crash killed six U.S. Marines and an attack killed four French soldiers, prompting Paris to consider an early troop withdrawal. The Marines died after their CH-53 helicopter crashed in Helmand province, a U.S. military official said. The NATO-led force reported no enemy activity in the area, but the Taliban claimed credit for bringing down the chopper. Separately, an Afghan soldier killed four French soldiers and injured 15 others, one critically, in eastern Afghanistan, French officials said. President Nicolas Sarkozy said he was suspending French training operations and combat help as a result. ""The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers,"" he said. France could bring its troops back early from Afghanistan if the necessary security is not restored, Sarkozy said. France has 3,935 troops in Afghanistan, according NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Sarkozy will send French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet to Afghanistan, he said. ""It was during a training session inside the base that a shooter killed four of our soldiers. This is unacceptable and demands a full investigation,"" Longuet said. A French official told CNN the French troops were unarmed as they were inside their base, conducting normal training operations with their Afghan partners. The official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said 15 soldiers were injured. The attack in Kapisa province follows a similar shooting last month by an Afghan soldier that killed two French soldiers serving in an engineers' regiment, also in eastern Afghanistan. Friday's suspected shooter, who was a member of the Afghan National Army, has been apprehended, according to an ISAF statement. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he was deeply saddened by incident. ""France has been generous to provide extensive assistance to Afghanistan over the past 10 years,"" Karzai said. ""Throughout history, the two countries have enjoyed a sincere relationship, which the Afghan people will always cherish."" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid called the attack ""sensible."" ""This was the latest attack by those sensible and zealous Afghans who have entered the enemy's army and it was also the best one so far as it killed more soldiers than any other such attacks before,' Mujahid said. Responding to last month's shooting, Sarkozy stressed his country's ""determination to continue working within the International Security Assistance Force to restore peace and stability in that country and contribute to its development."" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen paid tribute to those killed and injured Friday, saying it was a ""very sad day"" for ISAF troops in Afghanistan and for France. ""Such tragic incidents are terrible and grab headlines, but they are isolated,"" he said. ""The reality is that every day, 130,000 ISAF troops from 50 nations fight and train with over 300,000 Afghan soldiers. That takes a lot of trust among a lot of soldiers. ""We have the same goal. An Afghanistan that is responsible for its own security. That is what Afghans want. And we remain committed to helping Afghans."" ISAF spokesman Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings also played down the threat, saying, ""We train and are partnered with Afghan personnel every day, and we are not seeing any issues or concerns with our relationships."" Friday's shooting was the latest in a series of attacks on NATO forces by members of the Afghan army. In October, a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training, killing three and wounding several others. The shooter was killed in the incident in southern Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the cause of the helicopter crash, which happened around midnight Kabul time, is still under investigation, ISAF said. There was no enemy activity in the area when the helicopter went down in Helmand, said Col. Gary Kolb, an ISAF spokesman. The Taliban claimed responsibility Friday for bringing down the helicopter. Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, told CNN via text message: ""A Chinook was shot down in Zubair Karez area, between Musa Qala and Zamin Dawar in southern Helmand province, and a number of foreigners traveling in it were killed."" NATO is scheduled to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Many ISAF members are involved in missions to train and support Afghan forces as they prepare to take on greater security responsibilities. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Saskya Vandoorne, Masoud Popalzai, Pierre Meilhan, Barbara Starr, Mitra Mobasherat and Adam Levine contributed to this report.","Six U.S. Marines die in a helicopter crash, a U.S. military official says .

"(CNN) -- With an apology to his former business partner, ex-Facebook president Sean Parker has broken down and tweeted. ""Sorry Zuck, I had to do it eventually,"" Parker wrote Monday on his newly minted Twitter account. The apparent mea culpa to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is, so far, Parker's only post. But, by Tuesday morning, he had already racked up nearly 24,000 followers on the rival networking site. Parker was co-founder (or maybe an early employee, depending on who you believe) of music-sharing site Napster and created sites Plaxo and Causes in addition to helming Facebook in its early days. He's perhaps best known to most folks through his fictional interpretation by Justin Timberlake in the movie ""The Social Network."" (Movie-version Parker was responsible for two of ""The Social Network's"" most famous lines, urging Zuckerberg to drop the ""the"" and just be ""Facebook"" and saying that ""what's cool"" is not $1 million, it's $1 billion. For his part, the real Parker has called the movie pure fiction, saying he was portrayed inaccurately). His tweet goes on to ""blame"" Scooter Braun, an entertainment marketer best known as Justin Bieber's agent. Parker's Twitter debut comes, perhaps not coincidentally, as he looks set to launch his latest e-venture -- a video service called Airtime. His biographical information on Twitter includes a link to a Forbes profile titled ""Sean Parker: Agent of Distruption."" It also links to The Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm in which Parker is a partner. And maybe he doesn't owe Zuckerberg a full apology just yet. Parker's Facebook page has more than 38,000 people who ""like"" it -- outpacing his Twitter feed, at least for now.","With a nod to Zuckerberg, ex-Facebook president Sean Parker joins Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Four members of Florida A&M University's fabled Marching 100 band have been arrested on hazing charges, a spokeswoman for the Tallahassee college said Friday. The charges are unrelated to the November hazing death of drum major Robert Champion. FAMU police arrested three of the students Thursday night; the fourth turned himself in Friday morning, said Sharon Saunders, the FAMU spokeswoman. The students -- Hakeem Birch, Brandon Benson, Anthony Mingo and Denise Bailey -- were charged with hazing five Marching 100 band members who wanted to join a group in the clarinet section known as the ""Clones."" The five told police they were made to line up according to height at the start of each meeting. Then they were punched, slapped and paddled, according to the arrest warrant. One of the students, who quit the pledging process after the first meeting, took a digital photo of the bruising on her body. The initiation meetings, which began last September, took place at the home of Birch and Benson, the warrant said. Champion's death prompted FAMU's board of trustees to approve a three-part plan to tackle the issue of hazing on campus. The plan includes an independent blue-ribbon panel of experts to investigate. Trustee Belinda Reed Shannon told board members the panel would take a ""forward-looking"" approach at hazing on campus, and would not conflict with any current investigations into the Marching 100 band. Champion, 26, collapsed in Orlando on a bus carrying members of the band after a November football game that included a halftime performance by the group. Christopher Chestnut, a lawyer for Champion's family, has charged that Champion died after receiving ""some dramatic blows, perhaps (having an) elevated heart rate"" tied to ""a hazing ritual"" that took place on the bus. Some band members have said Champion died after taking part in a rite of passage called ""crossing Bus C."" One member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that students ""walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backward while the bus is full of other band members, and you get beaten until you get to the back."" No one has been charged in Champion's death; the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Orange County Sheriff's Office are investigating the case. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also launched a separate investigation into band employees, who were allegedly engaged in financial fraud. The medical examiner's office has said Champion ""collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body."" An autopsy conducted after his death found ""extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" as well as ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat,"" which is the fatty tissue directly under a person's skin. An attorney for the band's director, on paid administrative leave since shortly after Champion's death, said his client issued letters of suspension and withheld scholarships ""of all students whose names were provided to him once the incident was reported."" Julian White also informed campus police, attorney Chuck Hobbs said in a written statement. ""Dr. White applauds the efforts of law enforcement to arrest individuals that he suspended for hazing and hopes that they are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" according to the statement. ""Dr. White has been the leading anti-hazing advocate on the FAMU campus for years and his legal team continues to call upon President James Ammons to fully reinstate him to his position since the original reason for termination -- failure to report hazing -- is clearly unfounded by the record evidence."" White originally had been suspended with termination scheduled for December 22, but he was subsequently placed on leave until completion of the investigation into Champion's death. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: The band director's attorney again calls for reinstatement .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Just like any other first family in the world, North Korea's secretive Kim dynasty is often the focus of gossip and rumors, especially in neighboring South Korea. There was a lot of speculation after a recent report that Kim Jong Il's grandson, identified as 16-year-old Kim Han-sol, was scheduled to enter an international school in Bosnia. Less than a week after the report, YouTube screen shots and pictures -- reportedly of the grandson -- have been plastered on the news in South Korea. South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that it had tracked down photos of the grandson from the Bosnian school's Facebook page and published the pictures. The young man appears in photos wearing a suit and black horn-rimmed glasses posing with a woman at what appears to be a party. In another photo, the young man sports a blonde hairdo and is wearing a black T-shirt on the streets. The news agency reported Kim's nationality on the school website was set as North Korean. The school, the United World College in Mostar, confirmed its acceptance of a 16-year-old North Korean student named Kim Han-sol through a press release but stopped short of confirming the identity of the individual. ""The entry of a student from North Korea, furthermore from a very well-known family, has understandably generated surprise and comment, some of it critical,"" it said in a statement. According to Yonhap News Agency, Kim Han-sol is the son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's oldest son, Kim Jong-nam. Kim Jong-nam is the family's most outspoken member and has been seen at airports and other venues outside of North Korea. He is viewed by many as the outcast of the Kim family. It is believed the oldest Kim fell out of favor when he was stopped in Japan trying to enter on a forged passport on his way to Disneyland in 2001. The South Korean media has also focused on YouTube postings that Yonhap News Agency says feature Kim Han-sol. Yonhap released shots in which the YouTube user claims to be a North Korean studying in Macau. The person also claims to be ""related (to the Kim family)."" CNN could not independently confirm the identity of the YouTube user or the person shown in the pictures in the South Korean media. There are no known public photographs of Kim Han-sol and there's been no comment from the Kim family. The reclusive nature of the family leaves media outlets to leap at whatever opportunity they can to gain more insight into the lives of the Kim Jong Il family. Experts have commonly used photos released by the North Korean state-run news agency to speculate on the health of Kim Jong Il, examining facial color, posture, and even the style of shoes the leader is wearing. But the lack of access to verify most of what is circulated in the news has also led to blunders in the past. A photograph once released as an exclusive shot of one of the leader's sons later turned out to be an average South Korean man. The incident was only corrected after the man in the photo spoke out saying he was shocked to see he had turned into a Kim dynasty member overnight. As the latest round of speculation continues, the YouTube account reportedly linked to the grandson is no longer accessible and has been closed.","Yonhap News Agency has published alleged photos of Kim Jong Il's grandson .

"(CNN) -- Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis, who had a storied career in professional football as a coach, commissioner and owner, died Saturday, the team said. He was 82. In a brief post on their website, the Raiders said a statement would be issued later in the day. The cause of death was not immediately released. Much of Davis' career was spent in Oakland, where he first arrived as a coach in 1963 -- tasked with turning around a team that was picked to be at the bottom of the standings. The results were almost immediate, finishing 10-4 that season, and Davis was selected as coach of the year. At 33, he was both the coach and general manager of the Raiders, the website said, making him the youngest person to hold that dual position. His career started in 1950 as a line coach at Adelphi College in New York, the Raiders website said. He also coached at The Citadel, Southern California and for the then-Los Angeles Chargers before going to the Raiders. According to the Raiders website, by the time he arrived in Oakland, Davis had already been labeled a ""young coaching genius"" by Sports Illustrated. As commissioner of the American Football League in 1966, he played a role in the merger of that league with the National Football League. Davis' story, the Raiders website said, ""is a standard that no one in the history of professional football can match for winning and excellence."" He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 1992. ""Al Davis's passion for football and his influence on the game were extraordinary,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said on his Twitter account. ""The respect he commanded was evident in the way that people listened carefully every time he spoke. He is a true legend of the game whose impact and legacy will forever be part of the NFL."" New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson also shared his sympathy on the news of Davis' death. ""Al Davis was one of the most innovative and dynamic pioneers in the history of the National Football League. He was passionate about his team and about the game of professional football and he personified the legacy of the Raiders,"" he said.","Al Davis was ""a true legend,"" NFL commissioner says .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, new Apple CEO Tim Cook is expected to help unveil Apple's latest iPhone at its first big event since co-founder Steve Jobs stepped aside in August. Cook will no doubt be scrutinized for how he fulfills his new role Tuesday as chief pitchman for Apple's products. And the new iPhone, expected to go on sale sometime in mid-October, will almost certainly draw lines of shoppers outside Apple's stores. Then the question becomes: Can Apple make enough iPhones fast enough? As demand for its gadgets continues to skyrocket, keeping Apple growing at its amazing pace will be a key hurdle for Cook's regime. The consumer shift toward cheaper, portable computers -- and Apple's huge success there with the iPhone and iPad -- means creating and selling an ever-increasing number of devices each year. Right now, for example, Apple will have to ramp up production of millions of new iPhones, and possibly new iPods, for the holidays. After that there will be more iPads, Macs, and other products. It's important that Apple's new devices be stylish and technically impressive. But it's equally important that they be in stock when people want to buy them, something that Apple hasn't always been able to deliver. Only recently, for example, has the iPad 2 supply been able to meet demand. And as time goes on, thanks in part to new markets such as China, demand for each gadget will only grow. It's not enough for Cook and his team to keep coming up with exciting new products. They also must continue Apple's logistics revolution, so that consumers don't have to wait forever to buy new Apple devices -- or turn instead to the competition. Consider the total number of devices Apple must now have built and shipped per year. In 2011, including all iPhones, iPods, iPads, and Macs, Apple could end up shipping more than 175 million gadgets -- some 50 million more than it did last year, representing roughly 40% growth. Next year, Apple is expected to ship an all-time high of around 215 million devices, or another 40 million more than this year. And so on. It wouldn't be insane for Apple to have to ship 500 million units per year by the end of the decade. So Cook will have to figure out how to become the type of company that can ship 500 million gadgets per year -- from staffing to product design to iCloud server infrastructure to components to manufacturing, sales and support. The good news: Cook is already, arguably, the best in the business when it comes to this stuff. Over the past decade, he's made Apple's supply chain an industry leader. For Cook and Apple's SVP of Operations Jeff Williams, the plan is to keep it that way. (See Fortune Magazine's recent profile of Williams here.) As Apple enters its next chapter, some of Cook's biggest practical challenges will include scaling production, deciding how to prioritize the company's existing businesses and figuring out which new businesses to enter -- such as making TVs. (Then there's the whole ""vision thing,"" which is a whole different challenge -- and where Jobs, the master innovator, may prove to be irreplaceable.) Later this month, Cook will make his first pitch to Wall Street as Apple's CEO, as Apple reports its quarterly results. A year from now, we'll be in good position to judge his performance at the helm of the world's most valuable tech company. But first, it's time for a new iPhone.

"(CNN) -- Back in 2005, when he stopped studying third down tendencies long enough to work on a motivational self-help book, Nick Saban kept hammering on one phrase. The book's title was ""How Good Do You Want to Be? A Champion's Tips on How to Lead and Succeed at Work and in Life."" The phrase the University of Alabama's football coach was stuck on was mercifully shorter. ""Eliminate the clutter."" The clutter is you. The clutter is me. The clutter is this story, another horn in the vast media brass section trumpeting a college football game taking on Homeric proportions. ""It's everything out there that can take away from your focus,"" said Saban's co-writer, Brian Curtis. This week Saban -- called ""the most powerful coach in sports"" by Forbes magazine in 2008 -- is up to his furrowed brow in clutter. His No. 2 Crimson Tide plays No. 1 Louisiana State Saturday night in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in the most anticipated college football game in years. Both teams are undefeated, and it's the first ever SEC regular season game matching the country's two top teams. SI.com: LSU vs. Alabama really does mean everything to some, and that's OK . Saban, who just turned 60, is not exactly a willing contributor to the ruckus that surrounds big-time college football. When his own players doused him with the traditional Gatorade victory shower after Alabama won the BCS Championship Game in January, 2010, he looked genuinely irked by the display. Saban's no-nonsense nature -- he and a statue of him outside Alabama's football stadium are tied for number of memorable one-liners -- perfectly equips him for a moment like Saturday night. ""It's fun to play in games like this,"" Saban said this week. And then he broke out the wet blanket. ""But I also think it's important to be able to stay focused on what you need to do to play well. You can't drain yourself emotionally because of all the things that are happening surrounding the game."" SI.com: Alabama hosts LSU in the Game of the Year . The Saban method certainly has paid off. His overall college coaching record is 137-53-1, a .717 winning percentage. He has won as many national titles (two) as all-time major college wins leader Joe Paterno. But Saban is the only coach to win a BCS championship with two different programs. It is a testament to both Saban's coaching genius and his tumbleweed past that his DNA is on both programs involved in Saturday's showdown. Here's how he got there: . The son of a West Virginia gas station owner, he began coaching as a grad assistant at alma mater Kent State in 1973. Over a lengthy career, he has been employed by nine different college programs, and three more NFL franchises. Following four years as head coach at Michigan State, Saban was brought to Baton Rouge in 2000 after LSU had gone 7-15 the previous two seasons. Within four years, Saban delivered a national title. His professional travelogue didn't end there. Saban left to test himself as an NFL head coach with the Miami Dolphins in 2005. Two seasons there produced a 15-17 record, and then Saban was seduced by a once proud southern belle who had fallen into disrepute. ""I'm not going to be the Alabama coach,"" Saban infamously declared on December 21, 2006. On January 4, 2007, he was introduced as the Crimson Tide's next coach. He was apologizing for that one three years later in a Sporting News interview. Sort of. ""I apologize for any professional mishandling that might have occurred,"" he said. But there is a reason Alabama ponied up $4 million a year for Saban (university President Robert Witt makes a reported base of $490,000 a year). He is one rainmaker of a coach. While perhaps not always so dedicated to the truth about his comings and goings, Saban is all in with building winning football programs. And in 2007 Alabama needed him badly. With 13 national championships in the bank, and the legend of Bear Bryant growing dim, the Alabama football program of the early 2000s was a mess. One coach was tangled up in a sexual harassment charge and eventually got the program placed on NCAA probation. One hire never coached a game, fired after an off-season Florida strip-club romp became public. One abandoned ship after two seasons, informing his team he was leaving for Texas A&M via video conference. Another had the name (Mike Shula, son of Hall of Fame NFL coach Don Shula) but won few hearts with his 26-23 record. Then came Saban, whose stern dictatorship cut through all the nonsense. He is 51-11 at 'Bama, with one national title and the hopes of another resting on Saturday. His success did not sit well a couple states to the left. When Saban first left for the pros, LSU fans were mostly understanding. They even cheered him when he returned to Baton Rouge with the Dolphins in 2005 to take on the New Orleans Saints, who had been displaced from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. But when he took over a conference rival, he was a direct threat to their team and the game changed. On Saban's trip to Baton Rouge in 2008, he was greeted with the requisite effigy burning. The LSU student newspaper produced an editorial that proclaimed: ""For the record, Nick, the Tiger faithful hate your guts."" ""What people suddenly didn't seem to understand is that he didn't leave LSU for Alabama,"" said Glenn Guilbeau, who covers the Tigers for Gannett News Service. After ditching the Dolphins, ""the only open jobs were Alabama, Louisville and Tulane. What was he supposed to do?"" Time has somewhat softened the Saban-is-Satan storyline when LSU and Alabama play now. His connection to LSU was brought up only once in his press conference last Monday. In response, Saban sounded almost wistful. ""I really don't think a lot about that, but there are a lot of personal relationships we have with a lot of people because of the association we had with LSU,"" he said. ""The older you get -- and everybody knows I'm getting old -- you kind of cherish those relationships and really respect and appreciate them. I'm happy to say a lot of those things don't get affected by this game and what happens in this game."" Are the halcyon days of Saban-hating gone? After his clumsy departure from the Dolphins, Saban appeared as No. 9 on a Forbes top 10 list of most disliked people in sports. He has not made the last two editions of that list. When he completes this season, his fifth, it will match his longest stay at any of his coaching posts. ""I think there's a feeling that this is the right place for him and his wife at this stage of their lives,"" Curtis said. The Saban family was out front in the recovery effort after a devastating tornado swept through Tuscaloosa in April, only reinforcing his Alabama identity. Saban's Nick's Kids Foundation provided the $50,000 seed money to start Project Team Up, which coordinates aid for those who lost homes and loved ones to the storm.

"(CNN)  -- At least 510 people were killed in Caracas, Venezuela, in December, giving support to a recent report that called the city the murder capital of the world. A chalk message reads No More Murders as a student protests  killings in Caracas in this file photo. It's against that backdrop that the country's minister for Interior Relations and Justice announced efforts this week to combat crime in 2009. Minister Tareck El Aissami said Monday he will form 50 community police units in Caracas and take other measures so that ""we can have in a short time a culture of peace, tranquility and calm for all the Venezuelan public."" By all accounts, it will be a tall order. Foreign Policy magazine said in September that Caracas tops the list of five murder capitals of the world, with an official tally of 130 homicides per 100,000 residents. The city, which is Venezuela's capital, has about 4 million inhabitants. Foreign Policy is owned by The Washington Post Co. and published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The United States made the magazine's top five, too, with New Orleans, Louisiana coming in at No. 3. Its murder rate is estimated as 67 per 100,000 by its police department and 95 per 100,000 by the FBI. Still, the rate in Caracas comes in far ahead of the following four murderous capitals. ""Caracas has become far more dangerous in recent years than any South American city, even beating out the once notorious Bogota, [Colombia],"" Foreign Policy said. ""What's worse, the city's official homicide statistics likely fall short of the mark because they omit prison-related murders as well as deaths that the state never gets around to properly 'categorizing.' ""The numbers also don't count those who died while 'resisting arrest,' suggesting that Caracas' cops -- already known for their brutality against student protesters -- might be cooking the books,"" the magazine said. CNN affiliate Globovision TV reported this week that officials reported 510 killings in Caracas this month, capping a particularly brutal year. ""It's shocking,"" said Jennifer McCoy, director of The Americas Program at the Carter Center in Atlanta. ""It's the biggest concern of the population -- crime and security."" Federico Welsch, a political science professor at La Universidad de Simon Bolivar in Caracas for 25 years, has seen that crime up close. ""Violence is the major problem for Venezuelans, according to any source you use,"" Welsch told CNN on Tuesday. ""It's doubly sad because, primarily, the deaths occur almost exclusively in the poor sectors, and, secondarily, it's among youth under 30 years old."" McCoy points out that the killings are ""basically poor on poor."" From the 1970s to the 1990s, the poverty rate nearly tripled, from 25 percent to 65 percent, McCoy said. Even though the poverty rate declined during the oil boom that started in the 1990s, she said, the rate remains high. ""It's a combination of economic-driven crime ... with other types of gangs, to police abuse,"" McCoy said. ""The police are not properly trained and not properly equipped."" Anti-crime efforts in Caracas also suffered, she said, when the national government took over the city's police force in 2002. ""There has been trouble getting the police force back to par,"" she said. Welsch said he doubts the anti-crime measures El Aissami announced Monday will work. ""You can't resolve this problem with police,"" Welsch said. ""The government is co-responsible for there being so many firearms. There is no good gun control, there are no permits and there is no good control over the militias."" The problem, Welsch and McCoy said, transcends the drug trade and gang battles. ""You don't have the guerrilla problems,"" McCoy said. ""You don't have drug cartels. You don't have a large mafia."" Welsch lays much of the blame on the 10-year-old government of socialist President Hugo Chavez. ""The government discourse,"" he said, ""is that if you are lacking something it is because of injustice. Then look for it, take it away from those who have it. You can obtain justice with your own hands."" The magazine lists, in descending order, Caracas; Cape Town, South Africa; New Orleans; Moscow, Russia; and Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, as the top five murder capitals in the world.","Foreign Policy magazine names Caracas, Venezuela, the murder capital of the world .

"(CNN) -- ""An unconditional right to say what one pleases about public affairs is what I consider to be the minimum guarantee of the First Amendment."" -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. Black, New York Times Co. vs. Sullivan, 1964 . It's downright disgusting to listen to conservative and Republican lawmakers, presidential candidates, business owners and media commentators use such vitriol to describe the Occupy Wall Street protesters as hell-bent on destroying America. How in the world can anyone even form their lips to say such a thing when this very country was founded on the basis of dissent? Self-professed rodeo clown Glenn Beck castigates the Occupy Wall Street protesters, but he's always running off at the mouth about the Founding Fathers and how brilliant they were. Without dissent and protest, there is no United States of America! It's as if these folks never picked up a history book to understand how this nation was formed. The very notion of a United States of America started with someone saying, writing and screaming, ""Enough is enough!"" And when more and more of the early settlers became enraged at the heavy-handed actions of the British, that's when we were on our path to the American Revolution. Do any of these so-called strict constructionists even read the very U.S. Constitution they love to wave in the faces of their critics? Every American, no matter if you're young or old; rich or poor; red state or blue state; Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Native American; has the freedom to assemble and freedom of speech, which is at the heart of these protests. In this same space, I praised the tea party for not sitting around and complaining. Instead, they organized and mobilized to affect the political discourse in the Republican Party and have definitely had their voices heard. I may disagree with a number of things the tea party advocates, but there is no way I would condemn them for doing it. As Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas said, ""The right to revolt has sources deep in our history."" It's increasingly clear that some Americans love to talk a good game about protests, yet hate it when someone who opposes their views decides to stand up and be heard. Remember all of those political voices championing the people of Iran taking to the streets to protest? How about Tunisia? Egypt? Libya? Bahrain? What would this world be without protest? We would have never seen freedom in Eastern Europe were it not without the people there, in the words of civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, being ""sick and tired of being sick and tired."" Praise God that the children of South Africa, led by the African National Congress, didn't ignore the calls of history. If so, Nelson Mandela would be dying in jail and freedom would have never ended apartheid. This nation would not have been forced to make real the very principles cited in the Declaration of Independence, or treat every human being as an equal, were it not for the civil rights movement. Those brave men, women and children chose not to accept the status quo, and this nation and the world are much better off because they did. As a supporter of Occupy Wall Street, I understand fully the sentiment that is being expressed. The massive corporate greed that has devastated the wages of the common worker, and seen the pay of a bunch on Wall Street go through the stratosphere for literally making nothing tangible, has been immoral and obscene. Wall Street and their protectors in Washington -- Democrat and Republican -- say nothing is wrong with making a profit. That is absolutely true. But what is shameful and outlandish is to watch the American taxpayer save the jobs (and big bonuses) of these financial miscreants, only to see them jack up fees left and right. Without the American people they would have had to pack up their belongings and hit the pavement. Instead, they refuse to work with homeowners struggling to meet the big mortgage payments that Wall Street helped underwrite; then sell in exotic transactions that wrecked this nation's financial infrastructure. Conservatives call this an assault on capitalism. No, Occupy Wall Street is about trying to bring some decency and honesty back to an industry that used to have some. Instead, what we have today are literal financial pirates trying to take the largest booty they can find. They don't care about the long-term health of this country. It's all about the next quarterly earnings reports and their massive year-end bonuses. This fight that Occupy Wall Street is engaged in is nothing short of a battle for the soul of this nation. Are we going to continue to allow ourselves to be held hostage by the big banks? Will we continue to allow them to trample over us with their ""too big to fail"" attitude? No, no, and hell no. It's time to bring these Goliaths to their knees by any means necessary. That mean the young and righteous Davids must protest, march, sit-in, work the halls of Congress and state capitals nationwide, and make it clear that as long as Wall Street, its lobbyists and political protectors continue to mistreat the common man and woman, they are our mortal enemy. Now is not the time to dismiss the protesters as a bunch of lefty college students with no guidance, no substance and no mission. Instead of listening to politicians pimp the next generation, these folks are saying in the words of the founders of the nation's first black newspaper, Freedom's Journal: ""We wish to plead our own cause; too long have others spoken for us."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Without dissent and protest, there is no United States, Roland S. Martin says .

"New York (CNN) -- Lower Manhattan's controversial Park51 Islamic center is now in a court battle with utility Consolidated Edison, which says the center owes it $1.7 million in a dispute over back rent. In court papers, Park51 says it owes Con Edison only $881,000 and calls the utility's demand ""grossly inflated."" The center has filed suit against the company over a default notice it was issued in September, and a New York state judge has stayed any action until after a hearing in November. In a statement to CNN on Sunday, Con Edison said it ""remains hopeful"" that it can work out an agreement with Park51, which leases part of its property from the utility. Park51's developers did not return a phone call seeking comment. The center, which includes a mosque, drew intense opposition in 2010 from politicians, conservative activists and some families of the victims of the al Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center. The twin towers stood about two blocks from the site before they were destroyed by the suicide hijackings on September 11, 2001, leading critics to dub the project the ""Ground Zero Mosque."" The interfaith center's leaders said the project will be a 16-story community center with recreational, educational and cultural programming rooted in a spirit of cooperation and coexistence. City officials refused to block its construction, and Park51 held its grand opening in September. According to court documents, Park51 has exercised an option to purchase the Con Edison portion of the site for $10.7 million. The center says it has been paying $2,750 a month -- minuscule by New York standards -- under its initial lease. The rent was to be recalculated based on the market value of the property after it renewed the lease in 2008, but disputes over the appraisal lasted until this August. In September, Con Edison demanded the $1.7 million it said it was owed. ""The lease for the property calls for the tenant to pay this money now that an appraisal process has been completed,"" the utility told CNN. ""Under the terms of the lease, Con Edison requested payment of outstanding rent, but to date, tenant has not yet made the required payment."" But lawyers for Park51 argue the demand is based on ""a fundamental misreading"" of its lease and have accused Con Edison of improperly trying to take back the property. ""Whether it is bowing to political pressure or seeking to retain the valuable premises for itself, Con Ed appears intent upon proceeding with its wrongful termination (and cancellation of plaintiff's right to purchase the premises) and it has expressly threatened to do so,"" they wrote. Con Edison said Sunday it has defended Park51's right to buy the land. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","The Park51 center is locked in a dispute with Con Edison .

"(CNN) -- A security camera video of a toddler being run over twice on a street in China has swept across the Web in recent days and has drawn a chorus of horrified denunciations. How, we wonder, could so many passers-by have so callously ignored the girl's plight? As humans, we are horrified when we learn that a person in distress is not helped, even when, as in this case, many potential helpers are present. Our horror increases if the person is victimized in a particularly vicious or careless way by fellow human beings. Our horror is further heightened when we learn that the victim is helpless and the kind of person who normally stimulates our instinct to aid and protect. Our spontaneous reaction is to say: ""Had I been there, I would have helped; what is wrong with these people?"" If an incident occurs in a foreign country or culture, it is easy -- maybe tempting, as we grapple with something so baffling -- to conclude that the particular culture is to blame, that it is being callous, uncaring or egotistical. It is true that cultural differences exist in many aspects of human behavior, and many of these differences are not trivial. But in the Chinese incident, in which the small child was gravely injured before someone finally carried her away, it would be too facile to think that apathy in the face of others' suffering is a signature of the local culture. First, the public outcry and outrage within China was quite the same as what one would see in other countries. Second, there have been, of course, similar cases in other countries. Indeed, there was the torture and murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens, New York, in a 1964 street attack. Early reports, which may not have been entirely accurate, indicated that many people listened to or watched the attack and did nothing to stop it, and so a media blitz followed . Commentators asked: What is wrong with New York City, what is wrong with these times, and what is wrong with the particular neighborhood? Outrage in China after toddler run over, ignored . The incident spawned research on the so-called bystander effect: a set of brilliant experiments conducted by John Darley and Bibb LatanÃ©, who showed in their 1968 study that as the number of bystanders goes up, the probability of any individual bystander intervening goes down. This is so because each bystander is trying to solve a so-called ""volunteer's dilemma."" If everyone responds, the cost could be high and the volunteers might get in each others' way. It would be best if only one bystander responded, the thinking goes. If this is so, it is reasonable to ask who it will be and why it should be me. Since the original experiments, many studies have explored the bystander effect. Recently, I was part of a research team brought together by Peter Fischer of the University of Regensburg, Germany. We surveyed the existing scientific literature and statistically integrated the findings from 105 data sets. We found that the bystander effect is quite robust, that it has declined somewhat in magnitude over time, and that there are certain conditions under which it disappears or is even reversed. For example, in a situation in which several bystanders need to band together to overwhelm a perpetrator, they will be more likely to act collectively than to act alone. The heroic effort of the passengers on United Flight 93, which was suspected to be in line to strike a Washington target on 9/11/2001, comes to mind. It is these extreme cases, the callous injury of a helpless toddler and the heroic revolt of ordinary people in the face of terrorism, that capture our attention. With a bit of luck, most of us will not find ourselves in such existential situations. We must ask ourselves, however, how we will respond in more mundane situations that present us with fellow human beings who are in need. Will we help or hope that someone else will? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joachim Krueger.","Joachim Krueger says video of a toddler run over twice in China has shocked, horrified many .

"(CNN) -- Last month, President Obama proposed cutting almost $72 billion from Medicaid, the program that provides health care to America's poor. Such deep reductions are necessary, he declared, to bring down our staggering national debt. But what if there were a way to both save taxpayer dollars and improve Medicaid patients' health? We can achieve both if we are willing to consider an unorthodox solution: Pay Medicaid recipients who are smokers to quit using cigarettes. Thirty-three percent of the Medicaid population smokes, compared with 20% of the U.S. population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Evidence of the dangers of smoking, coupled with smoking bans and steep tobacco taxes, has cut the smoking rate in half for the overall U.S. population over the past 50 years. Now, it is widely acknowledged that smoking is largely isolated in vulnerable populations. Why don't Medicaid smokers quit in response to policies that are effective for others? One reason is that investing in preventive health care is difficult when you live month-to-month. But an indulgence the poor really can't afford is cigarettes. Smoking is expensive. A pack-a-day smoker could save more than $2,000 per year by quitting. How would the proposed incentive system work? Smokers on Medicaid would receive small payments in return for quitting or getting cessation counseling as a step toward quitting. Participants would have to hold up their end of the bargain. They would get paid only if medical claims data indicated that they were getting counseling or they tested to be smoke-free. Tests can easily be conducted using breathalyzers to measure carbon monoxide levels. It may seem implausible that such a limited compensation could push anyone to quit a practice as addictive as cigarette smoking, but there is solid evidence that it works. Research on addiction has repeatedly demonstrated that small payments have persuaded even cocaine addicts to stop using. Furthermore, in my research, I have found that the financial motivation to quit is more effective for low-income smokers than a motivation based on health concerns. Small payments can be effective by providing tangible, immediate and clear-cut gains. Taxpayers would have a lot to gain from this approach, too. Medical care for tobacco-related diseases costs Medicaid an estimated $22 billion every year. Treating the many illnesses associated with smoking -- emphysema, coronary heart disease and lung cancer, to name a few -- is expensive. Pregnant smokers risk premature childbirth and often expensive medical treatment for their newborns. Sensible as they are, incentive payments to smokers on Medicaid face many obstacles before they can be adopted by the federal government. Many people, including politicians, will chafe at paying people to do something they ought to do on their own. Smoking carries the taint of a moral vice, a bad habit that should require no incentive to abandon. But providing incentives to promote positive behaviors is a common practice and often uncontroversial. Employers and life insurers, for example, increasingly provide financial incentives to stop smoking. They consider these incentives good investments. Paying such incentives could both improve health for the poor and lower Medicaid costs for taxpayers. Another obstacle to implementation is a lack of research on how best to design such a program for low-income populations. While in previous studies of heroin users I found that paying higher incentive payments is both more powerful and more cost-effective, we do not know the best level of payments for Medicaid smokers. Also we do not know whether it would be better to pay for using the counseling or only for actually stopping smoking, or a mix. We are getting closer to answering these important questions. Ten states, including my own state of Connecticut, were just granted the approval and the funds from the federal government to test the effectiveness of incentive payments in Medicaid. My research group, in collaboration with the state, will be investigating how a smoking-cessation program based on such payments could be made maximally cost-effective. We want to save Medicaid money while improving recipients' health. What if we really could make a difference by paying a little to save a lot? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jody Sindelar.","Jody Sindelar says paying Medicaid recipients to quit could save taxpayers money .
She says Medicaid recipients smoke more than rest of population, can afford it less .
She says tobacco-related disease costs Medicaie $22 billion a year; incentives can help .

"Cairo (CNN) -- I strolled through the halls of the Arab League's headquarters in Cairo the other day, perusing all the family photos of Arab leaders at various summit meetings over the years. There was deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, deposed and violently disposed of Libyan ""Brother Leader"" Moammar Gadhafi, exiled Tunisian President Zine Abedine Ben Ali, Yemen's beleaguered President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Syria's embattled President Bashar Al-Assad. Uneasy, I thought, must sit the other heads of state featured in those photos. But it was those surviving leaders, of such less-than-democratic countries as Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Sudan, to name a few, who instructed their foreign ministers to vote Saturday to suspend Syria from the Arab League over its bloody suppression of the eight-month-old uprising there. In the final months of 2011, the future is looking very uncertain for the creaking Arab political order. Egypt and Tunisia are no longer solid, reliable members of the bloc of conservative, pro-Western ""moderate"" Arab regimes the United States cobbled together in the aftermath of the October 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Revolutions and revolts -- finished and ongoing -- must be depriving many rulers of a good night's sleep. The citizens of the Arab world have finally had enough of the tired charades of the past. Increasingly endangered are the sham referendums where presidents won 99 percent of votes, where hardly anyone took the time to cast a ballot, the ""parties"" that were little more than mafias with empty slogans, and the state intelligence thugs who were a law unto themselves. That stuff just doesn't cut it anymore. As we strolled together through a ransacked intelligence headquarters in Sabha, Libya, a few months ago, one man told me: ""We used to fear our rulers. Now they fear us."" This year almost every Arab state, from the Atlantic to the Gulf, has had to at least go through the motions of initiating political reform. And while they'd be loathe to share their true motivations, I suspect Arab rulers didn't vote against Syria because they are new converts to people power or support the bloodied opponents of al-Assad. No, there is more to this vote than the so-called ""Arab Spring."" As much as aging Arab autocrats fear their people, they also fear Iran. The last 10 years have been good for Iran. First, the United States led an international coalition to oust Iran's bitter enemies, the Taliban, from power in Afghanistan. Less than two years later, the Americans did it again in Iraq, bringing down another implacable foe of Iran, Saddam Hussein, and then installing a new political order in Baghdad much more friendly to Tehran. In 2006 the Americans backed Israel's ill-fated summer war against Iran's Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, which emerged from the 33-day conflict stronger than ever. In 2007, Hamas, also friends with Iran, ousted the U.S.-backed Fatah faction of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas from Gaza. Iran was an enthusiastic backer of the revolt against the leaders of Bahrain earlier this year, though that uprising was crushed with Saudi help. In the meantime, there is growing fear over Iran's perceived nuclear ambitions, those fears stoked by regular pronouncements over the past two decades from Tel Aviv that Iran ""is on the verge of producing a nuclear weapon."" Against this backdrop is an across-the-board diminution of American power in the Middle East. At the end of this year the United States will end its military presence in Iraq, and soon afterward, it will do the same in Afghanistan. The Obama administration, with 2012 elections looming and after several half-hearted false starts and high-profile humiliations by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, appears to have given up trying to broker real peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Above and beyond regional issues, the U.S. economy -- and thus, its political clout -- is in decline. Increasingly, America is viewed in the Middle East as an economically bankrupt, militarily and diplomatically overextended, withering superpower. In short, a huge vacuum looms in the region, and Iran could be the chief beneficiary. Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states are alarmed, and are eager to cut Iran down to size. The uprising in Syria went a long way to undercut Iran's oldest and most reliable Arab ally in Damascus, and Saturday's vote to suspend Syria from the Arab League was an added bonus. Syria is now isolated more than ever before, which means Iran's other allies in the region -- Hamas and Hezbollah -- could suffer, too. There are other players in this great game. Turkey, having been repeatedly rebuffed in its attempts to gain membership in the European Union, has struck out on its own under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Missing in the emerging regional equation are any Arab counterweights to a resurgent Turkey, but more immediately, Iran. Saddam Hussein, who fought an 8-year war with Iran, has been replaced by a government in Baghdad with close ties to Tehran. Egypt, the Arab world's most populous nation and once one of the main pillars of the old order, is in the throes of post-revolutionary upheaval. The surviving members of those group photos at the Arab League are clutching at anything they can to make sure they can live for another summit meeting -- and another group photo.","There is more to the vote against Syria than the ""Arab Spring""

"Warrenton, Georgia (CNN) -- Coach David Daniel's worried pacing along the sidelines of a recent game doesn't even begin to tell the story inside his mind. But the wound over his right eye gives you a sense of his pain inside, two weeks after he was caught in the middle of a post-game melee that sent him to a hospital. Some say he was intentionally targeted by the other team. Others say it was trash talking run amok -- including a text message by a coach -- all set against a raging high school football rivalry in rural Georgia. Either way, a lifelong high school football coach now has bolts holding together his eye socket after it was shattered by a player's football helmet. ""It was like if you had crushed up cornflakes, that's what all this bone looked like,"" Daniel said, motioning to his right eye. On the night of October 14, Daniel's team, the Screaming Devils of Warren County, defeated the Mighty Bulldogs of nearby Hancock County. As the Screaming Devils returned to the visiting team's locker room, they found the door locked. While waiting for a helper on their team to return with the key, the losing home team walked by, on the way to their locker room, and that's when it all began. No one seems to know who or what started the incident, but officials from both schools say both teams threw and swung helmets. ""It only took one to get the brawl started. Someone did not make the right decision,"" Hancock County Schools Superintendent Gwendolyn Reeves said. ""Whether it came from our side, or Warren County's side, I do not know."" Warren County Schools Superintendent Carole Jean Carey said it was hard to tell what was going on because so many people were involved. ""We just saw this sea of people, and it was moving like waves,"" Carey said. ""Then all of a sudden, we saw a helmet go up."" During the melee, sheriff's deputies pepper sprayed the players, and a player from each team suffered a concussion. After the incident was broken up, no arrests were made. Daniel says he was struck in the head with a helmet as he tried to intervene. He doesn't remember much about the incident. He lost a tear duct, and it's possible that he may need more surgery. ""It just makes no sense. I don't understand it,"" he said. Carey, the Warren County schools superintendent, wants a full investigation to determine if Daniel was the target of an attack. ""I'm not making any judgments right now ... I just have questions about how it could have happened and unfolded like that,"" she said. ""I think using a helmet, to smash somebody's face in, is using a weapon. I do. And we are very lucky the hit didn't move over just a little bit, and we could have had a dead coach."" Those involved agree that the incident started a week before, with trash talking about the game in the community and on Facebook. All of the Facebook chatter has been pulled off of the site, but school administrators in both counties say it was alive and well in the week leading up to the game. ""There was talk on Facebook before this game. There was some back and forth on Facebook, maybe some text messages,"" Carey said. ""I'm sure that if you're a team and you keep seeing either side trash talk here or there, or back and forth, I'm sure it gets you riled up inside."" The heated exchange also continued after the incident on October 14. According to a Warren County school affidavit, a former coach for the Warren County Screaming Devils who is now a volunteer assistant coach with the Hancock Central High School team sent text messages to his former players following the game, including this one: . ""Better stay yo stupid ass in wc (Warren County), B4 som1 get really hurt."" And later that night, another text message, ""How th[e] [expletive] I kno[w] about yall bull[expletive]. Yu started this [expletive] last week. Remember yu started this."" A few days after the melee, Hancock County Sheriff Terrell Primus called in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. But he told CNN that he does not believe that Daniel was targeted, and he said the locker room's door was not locked on purpose. ""It takes time to investigate anywhere from 100 to 120-some people that has to be investigated,"" the sheriff said. ""This is not something that is done in two days."" State law enforcement officials say the investigation could take months. ""We have no time frame. There are too many circumstances beyond our control to get a large number of witnesses to be interviewed,"" said John Bankhead of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. State law enforcement officials say they're looking into all aspects of the case including what role social media played in escalating the trash talking. The investigation will take place in these two rural northeastern Georgia counties, about 22 miles apart, both poor farming communities with high unemployment. ""The kids know each other. There are family members on both teams,"" said coach Zachery Harris of Hancock Central High School. Harris is also among those blaming social media for fanning the flames of the two schools' rivalry. ""Facebook kinda keeps everything going. ... So if I make a comment on Facebook that it was a great game, somebody may make a comment and say, 'Y'all gonna get your butt whooped,' and they go back and forth, and then, when they see each other, they've had this long conversation I have no idea about,"" he said. One school safety expert says that social media chatter and threats have a nationwide ripple effect that is forcing school officials to spend more time, money and energy on school security, at a time when dollars are hard to come by. ""Social media is increasing the communication speed to the point where threats that used to spread in hours and days now spread in minutes and seconds. And it's escalating very quickly, and the violence can escalate along with it,"" said Ken Trump, a school safety consultant. ""School administrators now find themselves dealing with things that start at night and at home, that can spread to athletic events."" But who threw the first punch in the fight that sent two teenagers and a coach to the hospital? ""I have no idea. They say we did, we say they did,"" Harris said. In addition to the social media issue, Harris says another part of the problem is peer pressure to retaliate -- whether it's in person or through social media -- and what's being taught at home. As for Daniel, as he faces the possibility of more surgery to repair his crushed eye socket, he's in pain and still has severe headaches. ""People want me to be hateful, and I can't do that. I can't do that,"" he said. ""I think it all goes back to what's taking place in their home and who cares about them. I'm not going to paint these kids as different or bad.""","On October 14, a melee broke out between two Georgia high school football rivals .

"(CNN) -- When Al Charette traveled to the North Pole, he went under it. The USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, made history when it reached the North Pole on August 3, 1958, beneath the ice. Charette, who was part of that Cold War crew, recalls how this milestone was of much more significance than being a historical first. ""What we did,"" he says, ""is really expose 3,000 miles of coastline of the U.S.S.R."" Submarines, which submariners call boats, played a pivotal role in intelligence gathering and nuclear deterrence at a time of political tension between the United States and Soviet Union. Attack submarines sought out and tracked Soviet ballistic missile submarines, while U.S. Navy missile boats tried to keep from being discovered. ""We didn't want to make any kind of a noise that a fish didn't make, "" the 79-year-old Charette remembers. The Cold War may be remembered as a conflict without any battles, but for submariners, the danger on the front lines was real. Jack Gallimore started on diesel-electric submarines, including the USS Hardhead and the USS Sablefish in 1958. Cat-and-mouse games of two superpowers aside, risks remain even today for sailors who head out beneath the waves, says Gallimore, now 73. ""All the submariners,"" he says, ""when they go to sea, they're in harm's way."" Gallimore remembers an incident that happened during the turnover of older diesel subs to the Greek navy. He and other crew members acted as observers during the training phase. During a dive, the boat angled down steeply and the propellers shook. The sub managed to surface eventually, yet Gallimore insisted the danger was part of the job. ""We've all experienced when something went wrong,"" Gallimore says. Before any sailor can be called a submariner, he has to earn his ""dolphins,"" a pin that's the equivalent to a pilot's wings. The sailors must qualify on the submarines they are to serve by knowing the systems inside and out. The training and testing are rigorous. Greg Kane, 63, another Cold War veteran, qualified on the ballistic missile sub USS George C. Marshall. Earning that qualification was an enormous source of pride, he says. ""When you had those dolphins on,"" he says, ""you were a submariner. You were a part of the brotherhood of the fin."" The standards to be part of that ""brotherhood"" exist to this day. Surrounded by a hostile environment at all times while submerged, any mistake by a single submariner could prove dangerous or even fatal for the entire crew. ""My life depended on my other shipmates,"" says retired Master Chief Bud Atkins, 77, ""and it didn't matter whether they were a seaman or a captain."" Atkins, who spent time in diesel-electric and nuclear-powered boats, served below the waves from 1950 to 1980, when he retired. In addition to meeting these tough standards, submariners also faced the responsibility of knowing their boats might have to launch nuclear warheads at a foreign country. Kane, who maintained the launching systems for Polaris missiles during the Vietnam War era, says crew members underwent vigorous psychological testing well before even seeing a submarine. Various scenarios were thrown at them: What if your boat was called to launch a strike? Could you do it? ""The whole idea was really being aware of what the world situation was, what the dire consequences would be if you ever had to go through it and what would happen ... if you didn't have a deterrent force out there to stop something like that from happening,"" Kane says. Tom Russell, whose 20-year Navy career took him on a variety of vessels, also served on fleet ballistic missile boats in the 1960s. ""We just hoped that every time we went to battle stations that it was a drill because we all knew if it was not a drill, home would be in pieces,"" says Russell, 82. All these retired submariners speak of their service with pride, but they are guarded when it comes to details of their missions long ago. Charette grows nostalgic when recalling how a submarine could be in harbor or along a coastline and go unnoticed. Or suddenly surface somewhere unexpectedly just to send a message. Asked if he could describe any of these experiences, he replies with a grin, ""Not that I care to talk about.""","The USS Nautilus was the first submarine to reach the North Pole in 1958 .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Executing a successful remake of a video game can be like shooting blindfolded, and that's especially true when you're dealing with the fervent following behind Microsoft's ""Halo"" series. Longtime fans look for any reason to balk at attempts to repackage their beloved games, and for ""Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary,"" people who follow its development closely have reasons to be skeptical. It's the first game wholly developed without intervention from Bungie, the company that created ""Halo"" but which has since severed ties with Microsoft. ""Halo Anniversary"" is available only for the Xbox 360 starting Tuesday, the 10th anniversary of the original ""Halo,"" which launched alongside Microsoft's first home gaming console. The game adds high-definition graphics and a big-production musical score to the original, without changing much else. Producers often look at remakes as a way to add their signature to a well-regarded work, but the team shepherding ""Halo"" went to extraordinary lengths to preserve the feel of its decade-old model. Frank O'Connor, a development director for 343 Industries, the division Microsoft created to specifically handle the ""Halo"" franchise, stressed that ""Halo Anniversary"" was created to appease fans. The $40 price tag, versus the standard $60 price for new games, fits with that model. ""This is a celebration of the past."" O'Connor leads a team of a few people within 343 Industries that's tasked with making the final say about whether a storyline for new games, books and other media fits with ""the Halo canon,"" he said. With several bestselling books and more products in the works, this is a fragile process. Sometimes O'Connor has to temper his own instincts in order to stay true to precedents set by earlier games. For example, he wanted to hide a rocket launcher behind a waterfall in the second level of ""Halo Anniversary"" as an Easter egg for explorers. His team challenged him on it, and so he conceded: no rockets, he lamented as he motioned to the waterfall while demonstrating the game. Designing a familiar but unique 'Halo 4' The team within 343 Industries that's working on ""Halo 4,"" the major new game scheduled to be released late next year, has been given more creative freedom than the external group that's programming ""Halo Anniversary."" Kiki Wolfkill, the executive producer for ""Halo 4,"" said that being able to consult with O'Connor's team makes it ""incredibly easy"" to keep their stories straight. But Josh Holmes, the creative director for the game, said that despite the help, the breadth of the ""Halo"" franchise creates a minefield for storytellers to traverse. ""There are times when we're thinking about all of the different interconnected storylines,"" Holmes said. ""That's really important to us, because we believe in the universe and want to keep the universe consistent."" They declined to talk much about ""Halo 4,"" but they said it will strike a delicate balance between keeping up with innovations in other first-person-shooter games and keeping the mechanics familiar to fans of the series. The game will have a familiar control scheme, using two analog sticks for movement, rather than doing a drastic departure with, say, Kinect camera navigation, 343 Industries executives said. It may incorporate limited Kinect functions for throwing grenades or toggling settings using voice commands, like those in ""Halo Anniversary,"" they said. ""One of the things that's really important to us is that the game feels, at its core, like 'Halo,' "" Holmes said. ""It feels like 'Halo,' yet it feels new and unique."" Staying true to 'Halo' in 'Anniversary' edition . That same criteria are not what's driving ""Halo Anniversary."" The primary concern for developers was that it feel almost identical to the original ""Halo."" One roadblock that Saber Interactive, the team behind the single-player element of ""Halo Anniversary,"" ran into was a result of running an old game on the Xbox 360's faster hardware, O'Connor said. The game just felt smoother and speedier, he said. So the team tweaked the code in order to reproduce glitches found in the original. ""If things like that happen with physics or animation, and we go change it, then we're changing the game,"" O'Connor said after watching an alien in the game make an unintentional, jittery movement. ""Some things we had to go back and break to make it authentic."" But like O'Connor's failed attempt at hiding a rocket launcher, Saber wanted to do more. O'Connor and his team had to talk the developers out of overreaching. ""They just wanted to put their own stamp on it,"" O'Connor said. ""But we said, 'This isn't about putting your stamp or our stamp.' "" New features for 'Halo Anniversary' While the characters and scenes from the first ""Halo"" have been re-created with an attention to detail that takes advantage of the Xbox 360's processor, ""Halo Anniversary"" players can switch to the vintage look at any time, except during video sequences. This results in a brief pause, but it can be a welcome distraction throughout the game. The feature lets players compare today's standards to what was cutting edge a decade ago. At some points, like in grassy environments, the original holds up surprisingly well, but the aesthetic changes in ""Halo Anniversary"" aren't just for show. Lighting effects and brighter textures on walls were used to guide the player along in places where it was once difficult to navigate. These changes are not likely to upset even sensitive fans. Perhaps more controversial, the developers made some significant alterations to a particular character and added video terminals throughout the game. Both were done for the purpose of broadening the plot and for relating it to games and books that have come out since the first game, O'Connor said. The floating blue-and-metallic orb named 343 Guilty Spark, which Microsoft's 343 Industries took its name from, has received a sort of makeover. The wisecracking robot, which guides players through certain levels but was known to stray, has been made more visible and talkative. His lines have been updated to hint at story elements from books and future games, O'Connor said. Likewise, the terminals placed throughout the levels, another element not found in the original, let players watch short clips that hint at events in ""Halo 4"" and other ""Halo"" media, O'Connor said. The online multiplayer component in ""Halo Anniversary"" has more in common with ""Halo: Reach"" than it does with the original. It uses the same ""Reach"" game engine that was designed by Bungie. Certain Affinity, an Austin, Texas, game developer, rebuilt versions of a few maps and weapons from the first ""Halo"" to be played with friends. ""Halo: Reach"" owners will be able to access the modes for free. The true test: Fan appraisals . You can never quite gauge how fans will react to seeing one of their beloved entertainment artifacts recreated for a new generation. Remember when George Lucas remastered ""Star Wars"" in the late 1990s? ""Han shot first,"" a reference to a particular scene from the original movie that was changed, remains the bane of many geeks. Eagle-eye followers of ""Halo"" have begun grumbling over the addition of metallic fins lining the bottom of the ring that surrounds the planet in the game. Execs from 343 Industries initially said the fins were present in the first game but not visible due to the low graphic resolution. In fact, the fins are an important element of the plot in the Greg Bear novel ""Halo: Primordium,"" which is set to come out in January, O'Connor said. Without them, the game would be inconsistent with the book. As ""Star Wars"" fans nervously await the three-dimensional remakes that are in the works, ""Halo Anniversary"" players with television sets that support the feature will get to play in 3-D glory. ""Halo Anniversary"" and ""Star Wars"" have one more thing in common. The musical score for the new ""Halo"" game was recorded using Lucas' Skywalker Symphony Orchestra. ""Halo Anniversary"" includes the ability to switch back to the music from the original game, ""though I don't see why you'd want to,"" O'Connor said.","""Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary"" is a remake of the original for Xbox 360 .
The developers went to great pains to stay true to the first ""Halo's"" formula .
The team working on ""Halo 4"" has more freedom to flex their creative muscles ."
"New York (CNN) -- Police hauled away protesters in various cities Sunday as Occupy Wall Street rallies continued for the 30th day. In Washington, D.C., 19 people were arrested by Supreme Court Police, a spokeswoman said. New York authorities arrested 14 people for violating a midnight curfew by sitting in a fountain with no water at Washington Square Park. The number was in addition to 78 arrested Saturday in citywide protests. ""It was a classic peaceful sit-in,"" said Paul Browne, the deputy police commissioner. In Chicago, a police spokesman said there were ""multiple"" arrests early Sunday for disorderly conduct and violating an 11 p.m. curfew. And in Minneapolis, a woman was arrested for trespassing, CNN affiliate KARE reported. City police officials declined to comment. About 150 people were camped out under a canopy near city hall after police took away their tents, a Minneapolis protest organizer said. ""It's cold. We don't have any protection from the elements,"" said organizer April Lukes-Streich. In New York, where the Occupy Wall Street movement started, authorities had warned protesters they would be arrested if they defied the curfew. Police stood guard at the entrance of Washington Square Park, sending protesters spilling out into nearby streets. They chanted anti-Wall Street slogans and banged drums as they wandered into the night. The arrests came hours after thousands marched to New York's iconic Times Square on Saturday night, hoisting signs and chanting. Browne described the Times Square rally as orderly. As police cleared the street, protesters chanted, ""We are peaceful"" and ""The whole world is watching."" In another part of the city, another group of protesters made their voices heard. ""Banks got bailed out, we got sold out,"" chanted a crowd meandering east of the city's Zuccotti Park, considered a home base for the Manhattan protesters. Columns of police on patrol and atop scooters monitored the march, but as dusk fell, it appeared largely peaceful. In addition to the nationwide rallies, demonstrations have picked up steam, culminating in a global day of protests Saturday in Europe, Asia and Australia. The Occupy Wall Street movement started last month as a backlash against the economy and what demonstrators say is an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite. Organizers say they are inspired by the Arab Spring that led to the toppling of regimes in Tunisia and Egypt. The founding movement in the United States has spread to other major cities in the nation.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama took the push for his stalled $447 billion jobs plan to North Carolina on Monday, telling two audiences that alternative proposals put forward by his Republican critics amount to little more than sops to the rich that will gut critical regulations and fail to restore economic growth. My ""bill will help put people back to work and give our economy a boost right away,"" Obama told a morning crowd at Asheville Regional Airport. ""But apparently, none of this matters"" to GOP leaders. ""I've gone out of my way to find areas of cooperation"" with congressional Republicans, the president declared. ""We're going to give members of Congress another chance to step up to the plate and do the right thing."" But ""if they vote against these proposals again ... then they're not going to have to answer to me. They're going to have to answer to you,"" he said. Later Monday, Obama told students at West Wilkes High School in Millers Creek that Republican opposition to his plan ""makes no sense,"" and he criticized the GOP alternative proposal as an attempt to satisfy the party's conservative wing. ""It's way overdue for us to stop trying to satisfy some branch of the party and take some common-sense steps to help"" the economy and the nation, he said to a cheering crowd. Since Obama's plan was rejected in the Senate -- due to unanimous GOP opposition -- Democratic leaders have decided to try to move it through Congress by breaking it up into a series of smaller legislative proposals. But his appearance, analysts note, was as much about campaign politics as the bill. The president will spend the next three days on a bus tour through politically pivotal North Carolina and Virginia -- two states carried by Obama in 2008 but considered up for grabs next year. Veteran Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, whom Obama defeated in the 2008 election, criticized the president Monday for using the taxpayer-funded trip for what McCain called political campaigning. ""On the taxpayer-paid dime, the president is now traveling, attacking the Republican plan,"" McCain said on the Senate floor. While noting Obama's right to level such criticism in a political venue, McCain added: ""Is that appropriate on the taxpayer's dime, since it is clearly campaigning?"" In Asheville, the crowd repeatedly chanted ""four more years"" before and during Obama's remarks. ""I appreciate the 'four more years,' but right now, I'm thinking about the next 13 months,"" the president said. ""We don't have time to wait. We've got a choice right now."" Obama's senior strategist, David Axelrod, vowed Sunday that every part of the bill will eventually have a vote. ""The American people support every single plank of that bill, and we're going to vote on every single one of them,"" Axelrod said on ABC's ""This Week."" He would not say which part of the plan would come first. Republicans will ""get a vote on whether they believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and middle-class Americans, or whether we should protect tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires,"" Obama said in a written statement last Tuesday. Meanwhile, demonstrators in Southern California said they'd gather Monday to protest the GOP's stance on the president's jobs bill. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and California Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Ed Royce will be together in the area for a fundraising event. ""Members of the Courage Campaign, teachers and health care workers will deliver a petition to Speaker Boehner signed by 25,000 Courage Campaign members ... demanding that he hold a vote on President Obama's American Jobs Act,"" a statement from the demonstrators said. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said over the weekend that there could be agreement on some elements. ""Let's work together. Let's find some of the things in his plan that we agree with, and let's go ahead and do that for the American people,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday."" The past week was an indication that ""we can come together,"" Cantor said, citing the passage of three trade bills. Cantor did not make clear exactly where areas of agreement may be. But he cited the need to help small businesses find capital, unemployment insurance reform and infrastructure spending as broad ideas for which both sides have expressed support. But ""we're not going to be for tax increases on small businesses,"" Cantor said of the president's plan. Republicans filibustered the Senate version of the president's jobs bill last week, though a handful of Democrats had said they would have opposed the measure if it had made it to the chamber's floor. Among other things, Obama's overall blueprint includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut, an extension of jobless benefits, new tax credits for businesses that hire the long-term unemployed and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters. The largest measure in the package is the payroll tax cut, which comes at a projected cost of $265 billion. Employees normally pay 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security, but they are now paying only 4.2%. That break is set to expire at the end of December. Obama wants to cut the tax in half, to 3.1%. Republicans previously embraced the cut, but have increasingly questioned its economic merit. A second key measure -- estimated to cost roughly $44 billion -- is the extension of emergency jobless benefits to help the long-term unemployed. Lawmakers first expanded benefits to cover 99 weeks in 2009, and have since reauthorized the expansion five times. Republicans are at particularly sharp odds with Democrats over how to pay for the plan. GOP leaders oppose a provision that would fund the measure through a 5.6% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million. Republicans have accused the president of engaging in so-called ""class warfare,"" while Democrats say wealthier Americans need to share in the cost of fiscal responsibility. On Monday, a Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that Democrats will seek a 0.5% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million to pay for the first individual component of Obama's broader jobs package. That component of the larger jobs bill would provide $35 billion in aid to states to help preserve jobs for teachers and first responders, the White House and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's office said. However, a top Senate Republican leadership aide immediately said that Republicans -- and some Democrats -- probably would not be willing to go along with a tax increase to pay for the measure.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York woman releases a deep sigh of relief as she reflects on a court ruling that her spouse will not be torn from her by the looming threat of deportation. ""Now we can make plans, and we have all the time in the world,"" Cristina Ojeda, 26, tells CNN. Monday, she received a letter confirming the ruling by Immigration Judge Terry Bain that will allow her wife, Argentina-born Monica Alcota, 36, to stay in the United States, according to the couple's attorney, Lavi Soloway. Soloway said this is the first time the government had asked an immigration court to close removal proceedings against a spouse in a same-sex couple since the Department of Homeland Security announced November 17 that a ""working group"" would be reviewing all pending immigration cases. The group began the process of identifying and closing ""low priority"" deportation cases three days after Soloway submitted the request to close Alcota's immigration case, the attorney said. ""We're really gratified because we feel that government moved in the right direction in the time we needed,"" Soloway told CNN. He made the request to halt deportation based on Alcota's marriage to Ojeda, who is a U.S. citizen, and on Alcota's ""strong moral character, family presence, and deep ties to members of the community."" Alcota lives with Ojeda in Queens, where she restores antiques. Until Monday, life for Alcota and Ojeda had been put on hold for two years. Alcota had been living in the United States for more than 10 years since overstaying her tourist visa, when she was pulled off a Greyhound bus in July of 2009 and taken into a detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Ojeda explained. Ojeda, a social worker in Queens, traveled two expensive hours by subway, bus, train, and sometimes cab -- there and back every day for three months -- to see Alcota. ""Looking back on those days, we have come so far, we have accomplished something really big,"" Ojeda said. The couple was married in Connecticut in 2010, before New York law allowed same-sex marriages. ""We have gone through a really rough road these past two years. The burden was horrible. We never knew what was going to happen,"" Ojeda said. ""We lived in fear we were going to be torn apart,"" she told CNN. While celebrating their success, Ojeda said ""the battle is not over."" She told CNN that Alcota's effort to be granted a green card, which was originally denied, now has been submitted for appeal. ""Of course, we will not have full equality until DOMA is gone,"" the couple said in written statement. The Defense of Marriage Act bans federal recognition of same-sex marriages. The act also says that states cannot be forced to recognize such marriages performed in other states. Despite the battle ahead, the happily wed lesbian couple is excited to have their life back. ""At least we have this. We know she is not going to be taken away, we can live our lives a little better, we can do things we haven't been able to do,"" an emotional Ojeda told CNN between joyous gasps. The couple is even turning over the idea of renting a new apartment and perhaps getting a new car. CNN's Kristen Hamill contributed to this report.","A court ruling takes away the threat of deportation for a woman in a same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Sachin Tendulkar's wait for a history-making 100th international century continues after the legendary Indian cricketer fell short again in the first Test against Australia in Melbourne on Tuesday. The 38-year-old ""Little Master"" was dismissed for 73 in the final over of the second day as the tourists reached 214-3 in reply to Australia's first-innings total of 333. Tendulkar is international cricket's record run scorer in both the five-day and limited overs formats but has been stranded on 99 centuries since March. He added 117 with Rahul Dravid after coming to the crease at 97-2, following opening batsman Virender Sehwag's quickfire 67 off 83 balls. Sehwag passed 8,000 runs in Tests as he registered his 31st half-century. Australia lose late wickets against India . Tendulkar continued the brisk pace, as he hit eight fours and a six from 98 deliveries faced, reaching his 64th Test half-century before being bowled by Peter Siddle. Dravid was unbeaten on a patient 65 off 185 balls, with the 38-year-old notching his 63rd Test fifty, while Ishant Sharma successfully negotiated the final three balls of the day to leave India 119 runs behind Australia with seven wickets remaining. Dravid is the second-highest Test run scorer of all time behind Tendulkar on 13,162, having extended his margin over Australia's Ricky Ponting (12,718). India, seeking a first series victory in Australia in 64 years in the four-match competition, lost an early wicket when Gautam Gambhir was caught by wicketkeeper Brad Haddin off the bowling of Ben Hilfenhaus for just three runs with the score at 22. Australia had resumed on 277-6, with Haddin on 21 and Siddle unbeaten on 34. Both fell to Zaheer Khan with the addition of only 14 runs as Haddin was caught by Sehwag for 27 and Siddle by wicketkeeper captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni for 41. Left-arm fast bowler Khan ended with figures of 4-77 off 31 overs, while off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took the last two wickets to fall to finish with 3-81. Ashwin said the Indians were not concerned by Tendulkar's failure to reach the coveted landmark. ""It's going to eventually happen, no point in bothering about it. We're very happy to be in the position we are presently,"" the 25-year-old told reporters. In other Test action Tuesday, left-arm paceman Chanaka Welegedera took five wickets for 52 runs as Sri Lanka bowled out South Africa for just 168 at Kingsmead in Durban. It left the tourists with a commanding first innings lead of 170 in the second Test, having lost the first by an innings and 81 runs. Sri Lanka lost captain Tillekeratne Dilshan, dismissed by Dale Steyn, to be seven for one when bad light drew proceedings on the second day to an early close. Welegedera had all his victims caught behind or in the slips and was superbly backed up by left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, who four for 49. Earlier, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 338 with Thilan Samaraweera the last man out for 102. Marchant de Lange took seven wickets for 81 on his debut for South Africa, the best figures recorded by any bowler in Test cricket in 2011.","Sachin Tendulkar dismissed for 73 in final over of second day in Melbourne Test .

"(CNN) -- Actor and Iraq war veteran J.R. Martinez is the spokesman for Operation Finally Home, an organization that provides free custom-built homes for injured veterans. The nonprofit was started by Dan Wallrath, who was a top 10 CNN Hero last year. Martinez recently sat down with CNN's Sonya Hamasaki to talk about CNN Heroes, his recent success on ""Dancing With the Stars"" and the efforts of Operation Finally Home. Below are excerpts from that interview. Sonya Hamasaki: What inspired you to get involved with Dan Wallrath's efforts? J. R. Martinez: I heard about him in Houston, Texas, and that's where we met. I heard about the great things he was doing by himself with just a couple of friends. And I thought to myself, ""Anyone who's doing things from the goodness of their heart is somebody I want to be involved with."" Hamasaki: How does Operation Finally Home work? Martinez: Operation Finally Home helps to give wounded troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan a mortgage-free home. It really changes lives, and it gives people hope. A lot of times, one of the biggest things for our troops is getting jobs. If they can have a home, it then kind of alleviates some pressure and they can start focusing on the job aspect of things. Hamasaki: What's it like to see the reaction when someone finds out they have a free home? Martinez: It's amazing to witness the transition ... to see their emotions and their body language completely change. And it's not just the service member; it's the spouse, it's the parent, it's the brother or sister, it's the child. There's this change all the way across the board. It's a beautiful thing to witness that kind of emotion. Hamasaki: What's your personal connection with the organization? Martinez: It's a great feeling to be able to be part of the movement. I know the emotional void and the mental struggles and the physical struggles that the men and women and the families go through when they're recovering. So it allows me to understand the importance of it, and it gives me the opportunity to serve. Hamasaki: What other projects are you working on? Martinez: I'm involved with ""Dancing With the Stars"" at the moment, and it's an exciting ride. It's fun, and it's a great platform for me to share who I am with people. At the same time, I'm still doing motivational speaking. I believe that we all have something to share with someone else that can better someone else's life. Hamasaki: Who are your personal heroes? Martinez: There are a lot of people who can be classified as heroes and do great things and inspire me. My mother is my hero. My mother has done so much for me in my life and has continuously been there and been my rock. Then I come across wounded troops who persevere every single day, who smile, who have a positive attitude, and they're my heroes for what they have done. And Dan Wallrath is a hero for the hope he's given to these families by giving them a brand new home.","Operation Finally Home builds custom homes for wounded U.S. veterans .

"(CNN) -- Authorities arrested at least nine people after a ""series of fights"" at the nation's biggest shopping mall sent chairs flying and caused after-Christmas shoppers to flee, officials in Minnesota said Tuesday. Police and security officers at the Mall of America arrested a mix of young adults and juveniles after a food-court fight around 4 p.m. Monday broke up into brawls elsewhere in the shopping center, Bloomington Police Department Commander Mark Stehlik said. At one point, police received reports of up to 10 separate fights, he said. Video of one incident showed a man picking up a chair to throw as crowds of shoppers, some screaming, fled a mall food court. The video also showed a group of what appeared to be youths brawling before police officers intervened. Witnesses described a chaotic scene. ""There were drinks thrown on the floor and chairs being thrown everywhere,"" witness Tess Dessalgne told television station KARE. She reported that ""everyone started running toward the fight,"" while the video showed others leaving the area. Another woman told CNN affiliate WCCO that she ""didn't really know what was going on"" when stores unexpectedly began closing down but soon saw police ""pushing us all away from Nordstrom (department store)."" ""Unfortunately, as we have witnessed at shopping sites across the country this week, large groups of individuals can come together and create bad situations,"" mall officials said in a statement. ""It is very unfortunate to see these incidents occurring, especially during the holiday shopping season when families are out spending time together."" No serious injuries were reported, the statement said. The mall remained open, although some stores closed down temporarily. Some witnesses told WCCO the fights began after reports that rappers Lil' Wayne and Drake were visiting the mall. ""I've heard that and some other things as far as speculation. I don't know that there's anything to substantiate that,"" Stehlik said. Investigators are still working to determine what caused the fight, he said. ""Frankly, at this time, we don't really have any idea, and we might never. It's hard to say what starts a fight,"" he said. The mall responded to a query on Twitter by saying, ""Drake is not here."" ""There was no shooting,"" the mall tweeted to one person. ""Chairs were thrown in the food court resulting in the loud noise you heard."" At one point, more than 30 officers were trying to calm the crowd, Stehlik said. He described the series of fights as a ""highly unusual event."" ""We kind of pushed people out toward one of the exit doors and out of the mall in an attempt to quell the crowd a little bit,"" he said. ""Once we got everybody out, the whole thing kind of just settled down and went back to business as usual.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's nude photo spread for Playboy is helping the men's magazine break sales records, according to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. CNN calls to a dozen newsstands in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Atlanta Sunday found just one that is sold out of the issue, and that store expected more to arrive Monday. Lohan, 25, was reportedly paid close to $1 million to pose for the photos taken in a style reminiscent of the nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe that graced the debut issue of Playboy in 1953. Unlike Lohan, Monroe was reportedly paid just $50 for the 1949 photo shoot that produced the image that was bought by Hefner after she became a star. ""The Lindsay Lohan January-February Double Issue is breaking sales records,"" Hefner said in a message posted on his Twitter account Sunday. A Playboy spokesman would not give sales numbers, but the official did say it was selling ""very well."" The Playboy gig was a rare moneymaking opportunity for Lohan, whose acting career has been hampered in the past two years by frequent trips to court, probation restrictions, extended drug rehab stints and several visits to jail. Her legal woes stem from two drunken-driving convictions in 2007, a necklace theft conviction in 2011 and several probation violations.

"(CNN) -- The $100 million lawsuit spurred by Charlie Sheen's dramatic firing from his hit CBS TV sitcom earlier this year has been settled ""to the parties' mutual satisfaction,"" Warner Bros. Television and Sheen's attorney said Monday. Warner Bros. and producer Chuck Lorre fired Sheen from ""Two and a Half Men"" in March, after a two-week public meltdown by the star that included attacks on Lorre. Sheen sued them for $100 million, accusing them of breaking his contract, which paid him a reported $1.2 million an episode. ""The pending lawsuit and arbitration will be dismissed as to all parties,"" the studio said. ""The parties have agreed to maintain confidentiality over the terms of the settlement."" Sheen's attorney, Marty Singer, echoed that, telling CNN, ""The matter has been settled to the parties' mutual satisfaction."" Sheen had wanted a public court trial, but a Los Angeles judge ruled in June that the arbitration clause in Sheen's contract required the legal dispute to be considered by a private arbitrator, not a judge. Sheen's character was killed off in the new season that started this month and Ashton Kutcher was added to the sitcom's cast.","NEW: Sheen's attorney confirms lawsuit is settled ""to the parties' mutual satisfaction""

"(CNN) -- The number of minors treated in hospital emergency rooms for drinking on New Year's Day 2009 was nearly four times the average daily figure, according to a federal study. The study, published this week in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, was based on data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network, which estimated that 1,980 emergency room visits on New Year's Day 2009 involved underage drinking, versus 546 such visits on an average day. ""This stunning increase in underage drinking-related emergency room visits on New Year's Day should be a wake-up call to parents, community leaders and all caring adults about the potential risks our young people face for alcohol-related accidents, injuries and death during this time of year,"" Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration chief Pamela S. Hyde said in a statement about the agency's study. ""Parents, clergy, coaches, teachers and other role models must do everything they can to positively influence young people -- including talking with them early and often about the many health dangers underage drinking poses to their physical and emotional health and well being."" The findings translate into an increase in sobering statistics, said Kenneth R. Warren, acting director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. ""For example, during Christmas and New Year's, two to three times more people die in alcohol-related crashes than during comparable periods the rest of the year,"" he said. ""And 40% of traffic fatalities during these holidays involve a driver who is alcohol-impaired, compared to 28% for the rest of December."" The New Year's Day levels outstripped those of other holidays. For example, Memorial Day emergency room visits for drinking by minors were 676; the Fourth of July level was 942. ""Whereas all underage alcohol consumption is of concern, consumption that leads to ER visits on New Year's Day should be of particular concern to parents and young people because such consumption may increase other risky behaviors,"" it said. ""Greater access to alcohol, less parental oversight and mixed messages from parents may fuel surges in underage drinking, which can result in visits to hospital emergency departments because of overconsumption or alcohol-involved accidents or injuries. The New Year's holiday may be particularly risky because underage individuals may drink more than during most other times of the year, including other holidays.""","Study estimates 1,980 emergency room visits occurred on New Year's Day 2009 .

"(CNN) -- How did Amazon.com manage to build a tablet computer for less than the $199 price tag? According to analysts' estimates, the company couldn't. In order to meet the low asking price, Amazon will sell the Kindle Fire at a loss when it debuts on November 15, analysts said. The Internet's largest retailer is apparently aiming to make up the costs by selling other goods, as it and other retail giants such as Wal-Mart Stores often do. Each Fire costs $209.63 to build, which includes paying for parts and manufacturing, according to technology research firm IHS iSuppli. That amount does not factor in research-and-development investments or marketing, executives for the firm have said. The preliminary estimate is typically based on analysts' talks with people in the supply chain and does not change significantly once iSuppli is able to tear down the hardware for a thorough report, executives say. Shortly after Amazon's announcement on Wednesday, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster sent a note to investors saying Amazon is likely to lose $50 on each sale of the Fire. When factoring in marketing and other costs, Munster's estimate could jibe with iSuppli's. Another analyst group, UBM TechInsights, says the parts cost $150, not including assembly. Even if this estimate is accurate, the margins for Amazon would be razor thin. Amazon is making a potentially expensive entrance into the tablet market with its aggressively priced tablet. The company could make up for the losses with digital sales or physical products bought through its online store using the tablet. It could also heavily market the Amazon Prime club subscription to Fire customers. Though, over what timeframe Amazon will recoup its costs is unclear. ""We're very excited about tablet computers,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a television interview last year, ""because they have great Web browsers, and they make it easier for people to shop at Amazon."" Factoring in projections for all of the e-books, music and video that customers will likely purchase for the device, Amazon is expected to turn a profit of $10 per Fire, iSuppli said in a statement. By contrast, Apple's iPad 2, the most popular tablet, costs $333.25 to make, iSuppli says. The iPad costs at least $499 at stores. Not including Apple's expensive marketing campaigns, that's more than $100 in profit on each sale with better margins for the more expensive models that have larger storage capacities. The strategy to lowball the price of a sought-after product in order to ""upsell"" customers on other merchandise is common for retailers, but is less so in electronics hardware. Hewlett-Packard has found buyers after slashing the price of its TouchPad tablet to $99, which it only did because the company is discontinuing the product. However, the business strategy is not unheard of. Microsoft was able to break into the video-game market by selling the original Xbox, then the most powerful console, at a loss. In the next game generation, it took Sony years for the PlayStation 3's manufacturing costs to come close to catching the price customers paid. In that industry, console makers reap licensing fees from game software publishers. Amazon, too, can try to make up its losses on software. It hosts an app store, digital music retailer, streaming video service and bookstore, all of which it takes a cut from. Not to mention the piles of nondigital stuff Amazon sells to be delivered to customers' doors. The only thing missing from the Fire is an app to let the delivery person in.","Analysts say Amazon.com's Kindle Fire will cost more to build than $199 .

"Waxahachie, Texas (CNN) -- Preliminary air quality tests show ""no threat to the public"" from a massive fire at a Texas chemical plant Monday, city and federal officials said. Waxahachie Fire Chief David Hudgins said authorities believe that the fire ""overran the sprinkler system,"" and it sent thick plumes of smoke high into the sky hours after it started. There were no flames visible by late afternoon, though by then the blaze might have discharged dangerous substances into the air, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency. That prompted EPA staff to dispatch air monitors to test for toxic vapors. Around 4:45 p.m. (5:45 p.m. EST), Waxahachie city spokeswoman Amy Hollywood said initial tests did not indicate any danger to those in the area. That assessment was later confirmed by EPA official Nicolas Brescia. ""We have not seen any significant level that would cause a public health concern,"" Brescia told reporters. Brescia said that tests conducted from flights over and around the fire detected small amounts of two chemicals, but nothing that would be considered dangerous to anyone outside the immediate vicinity of the fire. A statement from his federal agency also indicated that ""ground-level portable sampling devices did not show elevated toxic chemicals."" Earlier, Dave Bary -- a Dallas-based spokesman for the EPA -- said the most prevalent chemical that the company had documented, and produced on site, was anhydrous ammonia. The EPA official said earlier Monday that 48,630 pounds of the chemical, which creates a toxic vapor downwind when released, have been reported at the site. It was not known how much of the chemical was released into the air during the fire. Officials ordered the evacuation of a school, an apartment building and other industrial sites within an eight-block radius of the plant, said Diana Buckley, an official with Ellis County government. A shelter-in-place advisory is in effect for some smaller nearby towns northwest of the city, including Red Oak, she said. ""Everybody is out and safe,"" Donald Golden, environmental health and safety manager for Magnablend Inc., the plant's owner, said of employees and visitors to the plant. The plant stores and mixes numerous chemicals, said Amy Hollywood, a city spokeswoman. Images transmitted by CNN affiliates KTVT and WFAA showed orange flames devouring buildings and licking at tanker cars parked at the edge of the Magnablend plant, which is about 30 miles south of Dallas. Firefighters had pulled back and were using ladder trucks to spray water on the fire, Hollywood said. Multiple fire departments were on the scene. One of the them, the Midlothian Fire Department, reported that chemicals had been released in the fire, but no additional details were immediately available. Officials have said burning liquid continued to fuel the flames hours after it began, but they appeared able to wrestle the fire under control by early Monday evening. There was no immediate word on the cause on the fire, Golden said. No one was injured in the fire, Hudgins said. The nearby Wedgeworth Elementary School was evacuated, a school district official confirmed. Students were being taken to a school across town, school officials said. Navarro College's Waxahachie campus also evacuated, a receptionist confirmed. Southwestern Assemblies of God University, which is on the other side of town from the chemical plant, was keeping people inside but had not evacuated, spokeswoman Christina Freeze said. Magnablend produces custom chemicals for a variety of industries, including oil, agriculture, pet and animal feed, water treatment, construction and industrial cleaning companies, according to its website. Anhydrous ammonia is a clear, colorless gas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, ingestion, eye contact and skin contact. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: The EPA says ground-level air tests don't ""show elevated toxic chemicals""

Please, just drop her off anywhere, we don't care. Just somewhere safe where she can come home, please."" Her husband, Jeremy, urged anyone with information to call police. ""Anything, even the smallest information, could help lead to her return,"" he said. Lisa Irwin was last seen at about 10:30 p.m. Monday, asleep in her crib, Kansas City, Missouri, police said. Police were called to the home at about 4 a.m. Tuesday. ""It appears the suspect entered/exited through a bedroom window,"" authorities said in a statement. ""Evidence at the scene leads police to believe the child has been abducted."" Jeremy Irwin discovered the child missing when he arrived home from work, CNN affiliate KSHB reported. Police have said the Irwins are not considered suspects in Lisa's disappearance. Police Capt. Steve Young on Wednesday told reporters the family has been cooperative from the beginning of the investigation, but ""everything is still on the table. We haven't ruled anything out."" He said investigators ""really haven't developed any good, hard information that we can go forward with."" Nearly 50 tips have been received through a tip hotline, he said, but not all of them have been pursued, as some of them have been vague -- a person calling to report a child seat seen in a car, for instance. ""I know everybody's hearts are in the right place, but that's not anything we can do anything with,"" Young said. Police have conducted more than 300 ""knock-and-talks"" and searches of residences in the area, and more than 300 officers were searching for Lisa. There have been three searches of a wooded area near the family's home, he said. ""I promise you, if there's anything we think we can be doing, we've probably done it two or three times already,"" Young said. An Amber Alert was issued for Lisa early Tuesday but has been canceled. ""Although the investigation and search for Lisa Irwin continue, an active Amber Alert is no longer necessary in this case,"" police said. However, Lisa is still considered missing and endangered, according to authorities. Lisa is described as 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair, police said. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds. She was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it. She has two bottom teeth, a small bug bite under her left ear and a ""beauty mark"" on her right outer thigh. She currently has a cold with a cough, police said.

"(Health.com) -- Ginny Bank was 14 when her mother sat her down and said they needed to see a gynecologist. While pregnant with Ginny in the mid-1960s her mom had taken a synthetic estrogen known as diethylstilbestrol (DES), which at the time was prescribed to prevent miscarriages and complications. Later that decade, however, doctors connected the drug to a rare form of vaginal cancer that was turning up in young women exposed to DES in the womb. Bank's first Pap test came back abnormal. Over the next several decades she endured countless abnormal results, biopsies, and preventive surgeries, but fortunately she never developed cancer. But in her early 30s DES came up in a different context, when she consulted a fertility specialist after trying for several months to get pregnant. ""I was filling out a questionnaire before my appointment, and there it was: 'Did your mother take DES?'"" Bank recalls. ""Before then, no one had ever told me I'd have a problem getting pregnant."" Health.com: A top doctor reveals 8 fertility misconceptions . Cancer, it turns out, is just one of the potential health problems faced by the millions of women like Bank who were exposed to DES in the womb. According to a new government study published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine, these so-called DES daughters are at higher-than-normal risk for an array of reproductive complications and other problems, including infertility. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute analyzed data from three separate studies that have followed more than 4,000 DES-exposed women since the 1970s. Compared with a control group of unexposed women, DES daughters were found to have higher rates of infertility (33% versus 16%), miscarriage (50% versus 39%), preterm delivery (53% versus 18%), and ectopic pregnancy (15% versus 3%). The DES-exposed women were also 82% more likely to develop breast cancer after age 40, and more than twice as likely to experience menopause before age 45. For most of the health conditions included in the study, the increase in risk was even greater for DES daughters who had been exposed to especially high doses of the drug. Health.com: 25 breast cancer myths busted . ""Investigators tend to just study disease rather than people. But this actually looks at...the risk for an individual woman who's been exposed and tells her what exactly it means to her,"" says Robert Hoover, M.D., the lead author of the study and the director of epidemiology and biostatistics at the NCI, in Bethesda, Maryland. ""When you look at it that way, the numbers are somewhat staggering."" As many as 10 million people were exposed to DES in the womb between 1938, when the drug appeared on the market, and 1971, when the Food and Drug Administration urged doctors to stop prescribing it. (As if the health fallout weren't reason enough, researchers had also discovered that DES wasn't effective at preventing miscarriages.) Many of the potential health complications identified in the new study have been raised in previous research, in some cases with conflicting results. A 2010 study of DES daughters conducted in the Netherlands, for instance, found no link between exposure and breast-cancer risk. (Fifty-three DES daughters who developed breast cancer have brought a lawsuit against several DES manufacturers; the lawsuit is currently under way in Boston.) Health.com: 5 simple things that could cut your breast cancer risk . Researchers can't explain the apparent link between DES exposure and health problems, but lab experiments in animals have suggested that the drug may cause harmful cell changes or compromise immune function, the study notes. Despite the long history of DES research, the ""vast majority"" of health professionals working today know very little about the drug, says Candy Tedeschi, a nurse practitioner in Great Neck, N.Y., who worked for 20 years in a state screening center for DES daughters operated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""They either have never heard of it, or they think that it's long over with -- that the women affected are all dead,"" Tedeschi says. ""Hopefully this [study] will have a bigger impact and get doctors looking at some of the risk factors for these women that they weren't already."" Hoover and his colleagues recommend that doctors and researchers continue to monitor women who were exposed to DES in the womb. Some researchers have also begun to look for abnormal health patterns in the daughters of DES daughters, a group known as the DES granddaughters. Health.com: Can pregnancy predict your risk of breast cancer? Bank, now 47, doesn't have to worry about passing any DES-related problems on to a daughter. Tests conducted in her early 30s showed that she had the hormone levels and reproductive system of a 45-year-old, as well as a very small uterus. (Like most DES-exposed women, Bank can't conclusively prove DES directly caused these abnormalities.) After an unsuccessful round of in vitro fertilization, Bank sought solace in an online advocacy and support group, DES Action, and a year later adopted a baby boy. Her experience has made her ""very wary"" of prescription drugs and dietary supplements that haven't been well-researched, even though she works as a consultant for the dietary-supplement industry in Boulder, Colorado. ""I don't know what I'm going to do when I get to menopause and have hot flashes, because I certainly don't want to take hormones,"" she says. Health.com: Can supplements ease menopause symptoms? For his part, Hoover says the new study reiterates the importance of continuing to make clinical research safer and more thorough in the future. ""If it wasn't for this small group of women with this bizarre cancer back in the '60s, we wouldn't know anything about what turned out to be a major public-health disaster,"" he says.

"Washington (CNN) -- The head of the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Program Office has resigned amid a fiscal firestorm over the bankruptcy of a company that received a $535 million federal loan, DOE Secretary Steven Chu said. The loan program's executive director, Jonathan Silver, was planning to leave his post and return to the private sector this fall, Chu said in a written statement. Silver informed Chu of his intentions in July, ""shortly after the fiscal year 2011 budget was completed by Congress and it became clear that no significant new funds were included for the loan program,"" the energy secretary said. However, two House Republicans looking into the bankruptcy of the solar energy company Solyndra linked the resignation to the loan. Approved in May 2010, the loan allowed the company to build a factory in Fremont, California, to produce state-of-the-art solar panels. The company filed for bankruptcy in August, laying off 1,100 workers. Silver testified last month before a House subcommittee about the DOE's handling of the loan, which has been at the center of a fierce political debate over the amount of government subsidies issued to new businesses. On Thursday, Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and Cliff Stearns of Florida said Silver's decision ""does not solve the problem."" ""American taxpayers are already on the hook for the half-billion-dollar Solyndra bust -- what other shoes does this administration expect to drop?"" the representatives said in a joint statement that went on to criticize President Barack Obama's handling of the issue. Upton is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Stearns heads up the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, which conducted the September hearings in which Silver testified. Self-described as the ""The Financing Force Behind a Clean Energy Economy,"" the program ""is currently supporting 28 projects with a total loan amount of $16 billion,"" Chu said in the written statement. CNN has confirmed that Silver will serve as a fellow at Third Way, a centrist think tank in Washington that focuses on the economy, energy, national security and domestic policy.

"(CNN) -- The machine used by the late Dr. Jack Kevorkian in more than 100 assisted suicides will be among the items up for sale later this month, the auctioneer and his estate announced. The Michigan pathologist helped spur an international ethics debate by helping suffering patients die and pushing for this practice to be legalized. His conviction in one such case landed him in prison for eight years. He died in early June at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, at the age of 83. The auction will take place between 6 and 8 p.m. on October 28 at the New York Institute of Technology, according to a press release sent on behalf of both the late doctor's estate and the auctioneer. More than 100 pieces will be part of the sale, said Roger Neal, who is representing the two parties. Besides the noted Thanatron machine, which Kevorkian built, other items to be auctioned include some of Kevorkian's correspondences and invention ideas, a pearl flute, his doctor's bag, a master lock from prison and his signature blue sweater. People can also purchase provocative paintings that he created, which come with brief descriptions from the artist himself, according to Neal. The pieces are being kept under armed guard this week in Los Angeles, then will be shipped to New York. Neal said that the auction will be coordinated by David Streets, a Beverly Hills, California, fine art and celebrity memorabilia adviser, according to his website. A portion of the auction proceeds will go toward the charity Kids Kicking Cancer at the request of the attorney for Kevorkian's estate and the late doctor's niece and sole living heir, according to Neal. Kevorkian, dubbed ""Dr. Death,"" made national headlines as a supporter of physician-assisted suicide and ""right-to-die"" legislation. He was charged with murder numerous times through the 1990s for helping terminally ill patients take their own lives. He was convicted on second-degree murder charges in 1999 stemming from the death of a patient who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease. He was paroled in 2007. After his release, he said he would not help end any more lives. In an interview with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta last year, Kevorkian said he had no regrets about his work. ""No, no. It's your purpose (as a) physician. How can you regret helping a suffering patient?"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Four Virginia men were arrested Tuesday on allegations of bribery and kickbacks in what prosecutors describe as an elaborate scheme thought to involve hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts connected to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The suspects include two long-time Corps employees charged in an alleged conspiracy involving more than $20 million in bribes and kickbacks, as well as a plan to try to steer a $780 million contract to a favored contractor, the U.S. Justice Department reported. Another of the defendants is director of contracts for a company that did business with the federal government, the Justice Department said. Corps employees Michael Alexander, 55, and Kerry Khan, 53, as well as Khan's son, Lee, 30, and Harold Babb, 60, were all indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit bribery and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and aiding and abetting, according to a Justice Department statement. Both Kerry Khan and Alexander also face one count each of receipt of a bribe by a public official. If convicted, both men could each face a maximum 40-year sentence behind bars. Babb, meanwhile, also was handed a charge related to unlawful kickbacks, and could face up to 35 years in prison. He was director of contracts at Eyak Tek, an Alaska Native-owned small business based in Dulles, Virginia. Lee Khan, who controlled a consulting company with his father, faces a sentence of up to 25 years if convicted, according to the Justice Department. All four men pleaded not guilty in federal court in Washington Tuesday afternoon. Thought to have used their positions within the Corps, the elder Khan and his colleague Alexander are suspected of having funneled more than $45 million in payments by way of a federal contract that they oversaw, according to the indictment. About $20 million in fraudulent expenses were built into those invoices, which were then diverted to all four defendants, prosecutors say.. Authorities are in the process of seizing funds in 29 bank accounts, as well as three luxury vehicles and seven high-end watches, and are pursing a forfeiture allegation against 16 real properties financed in whole or in part with proceeds from the alleged crimes, the Justice Department said.. It was not clear Tuesday whether the suspects have retained legal counsel.","NEW: Defendants allegedly planned to try to steer a $780 million government contract .

"Cupertino, California (CNN) -- The iPhone 4S may not look any different from its predecessor, but it is Apple's only model with a sort of robot living inside. Apple's new phone, which was announced on Tuesday to be sold in stores on October 14, will have a new function called Siri. The program lets people bark commands or ask questions to the phone, and it will provide an answer or ask follow-up questions in order to perform a given task. At the news conference, Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing executive, called Siri ""the coolest feature of the new iPhone 4S,"" and the company is expected to advertise Siri heavily in its sales pitches. Apple dedicated a significant chunk of the presentation to showing the extent of Siri's ability to interpret requests and respond. ""Do I need a raincoat today?"" incites a robo-female voice to reply: ""It sure looks like rain today,"" as Scott Forstall, Apple's mobile software executive, demonstrated. Ask Siri to remind you to buy flowers for your wife at a certain time, and Siri may ask you to identify her in the phone's address book. Siri then remembers who she is for future requests, Forstall said. The software integrates with Yelp and WolframAlpha for relevant queries. It can also schedule appointments in the phone's calendar and transcribe e-mails or text messages. With Google's Android phones, users can dictate messages, too, which are then transcribed by Google's servers. Other cell phones support voice commands, which is handy when operating a phone while driving, but few people take advantage of the option. Even the preceding iPhones had a basic version of this called Voice Control, which can be activated in the same way as Siri, by holding down the phone's home button. But Apple's ambitions for Siri are much greater. Steve Jobs has said that Siri's focus is on artificial intelligence. ""We like what they do a lot,"" the Apple co-founder and former CEO said at the AllThingsD conference last year. Forstall echoed that onstage Tuesday, saying: ""I've been in the AI field a long time, and this still blows me away."" The big unveiling of the iPhone 4S on Tuesday was the first time most people learned about Siri, but the voice-assistant software is rooted in many years of extensive technical research. The project was born at SRI International, a nonprofit research organization. It was a part of an ambitious project called CALO, for Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes. The program was funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the government division responsible for Global Position System (GPS) and developments that led to the creation of the Internet. Work on Siri began in the summer of 2007, and SRI executives decided to spin out the project as a standalone business in 2008. Apple acquired the company in April 2010. ""The team was so happy when Apple did the acquisition,"" Norman Winarsky, a Siri co-founder who remained at SRI, said in an interview on Monday. ""They have a vision."" Before joining Apple, Siri provided a free app for iOS mobile devices. Apple removed it from the App Store on Tuesday, which means only iPhone 4S owners will be able to access the service starting next week. The version integrated into the 4S is vastly superior to the now-defunct app based on onstage demos. Apple spokespeople did not respond to CNN's requests to try the product at the event on Tuesday. Siri's engineers were excited for the opportunity to bake their software deeply into the new iPhone and build features that a third-party developer would not be able to do because of Apple-imposed restrictions, Winarsky said. ""We are going to be very proud,"" he said. ""The world of virtual personal assistants is going to be everywhere."" Siri's specialty is in its ability to interpret so-called natural-language requests. It was originally developed to handle typed queries, Winarsky said. For the voice transcription, Siri uses technology from Nuance Communications, Mike Thompson, an exec for Nuance's mobile division, said in an interview on Tuesday. Apple also licenses Nuance's voice transcription for features on the Mac. Like Siri, Nuance was spun out from SRI. ""We're thrilled with today's announcement,"" Thompson said. ""What you're seeing today is the beginning of the next generation [of mobile assistants]. That's really the deep integration and the totality of the experience."" For technologists, like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, the ability to speak into a digital companion that can understand and respond is a sci-fi dream realized. ""I don't like to learn programs' methods of doing everything,"" Wozniak said in a recent interview with CNN. ""I just want to speak it and have it happen."" Apple is betting that Siri's implementation of that will be a major selling point for the new phone. Despite no apparent technical limitations, the software will only be offered on the iPhone 4S at first. ""Siri is compelling,"" AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega said in an interview after the announcement. He indicated that he expected the feature would be a significant enough reason to spur current iPhone users to purchase the iPhone 4S.","Apple's iPhone 4S will have a new voice-assistant feature called Siri .

"(CNN) -- Iran's supreme leader took verbal jabs at the United States Saturday in his first public reaction since the United States accused Iran of plotting to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei labeled the allegations ""meaningless and absurd."" ""They (the U.S.) want to isolate Iran,"" Khamenei said over chants of ""down with America"" in a speech before thousands in the western Iranian city of Gilangharb. Also, an Iranian official said claims by the United States that a high-level U.S. diplomat had met Wednesday with an Iranian counterpart over the plot were untrue. ""There were no kinds of negotiations between the two countries, and there was not such a contact,"" said Alireza Miryousefi, press secretary for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations. The United States had reported having had ""direct contact with Iran"" about the alleged plot. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland disclosed the contact to reporters. A senior administration official told CNN it occurred Wednesday and was initiated by the United States. Two State Department officials said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice met with Mohammad Khazai, Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations. Ahead of Saturday's rebuttal of the claims of diplomatic contact, Iranian officials had previously declined to confirm the meeting. U.S. authorities have accused Iran of being involved in a plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States, Adel Al-Jubeir, in spring 2012. The alleged scheme involved a connection to the Quds Force, a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, which formally answers to Khamenei. Manssor Arbabsiar, a 56-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, are accused of conspiring to hire hit men from a Mexican drug cartel to bomb a restaurant, where the ambassador would have been. Authorities developed the case against the suspects with the help of an undercover informant posing as an associate of a Mexican drug cartel, according to officials and an FBI agent's affidavit. Reza Aslan, a religious scholar and author, told CNN on Saturday that the described plot ""just does not fit the Quds Force's M.O. (modus operandi)."" Using a drug cartel would be risky and a Quds Force agent would be more reliable than Arbabsiar, a used-car salesman in Texas, he said. ""It's sloppy. It's uncharacteristic,"" said Aslan. ""It really does not serve Iran's interest in any legitimate way."" Iran could more easily target Saudi diplomats in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere, Aslan said. ""Doing so on U.S. soil is unmistakably an attack on the United States, not on Saudi Arabia.""

"Altinozu, Turkey (CNN) -- Gofran Hejazi does not know whether to refer to herself as a wife... or a widow. She and her four children have been in limbo ever since August 29, the last day she saw her husband in the flesh. ""My eldest son sometimes opens up the computer, puts up his father's photo and starts crying,"" Hejazi said. ""Not a day goes by without my youngest son asking me 'when is daddy coming home?'"" Until he went missing from a refugee camp in Turkey last August, Hejazi's husband, Syrian army Lieutenant Colonel Hussein al Harmoush, was the self-styled leader of a rebellion of mutinous soldiers against the Syrian government known as the ""Free Syrian Army."" The sensitivity of Harmoush's case was plainly evident during Hejazi's first interview with a journalist since the disappearance of her husband. Police at the makeshift camp where her family lives insisted that a plain-clothed Turkish police officer accompany Hejazi during an hour-long interview with CNN. The officer was assigned ""for her protection,"" authorities said. He did not interfere with the interview and remained out of earshot for the duration of the discussion. Harmoush first attracted international attention last June, when he made an online video calling on other Syrian soldiers to desert and join an anti-government group he labeled the ""Free Syrian Army."" He was one of the first Syrian military officers to publicly break with the regime. Judging by the number of similar videos that started cropping up on the internet, it appeared Harmoush's rebellion was growing. Again and again, uniformed soldiers and officers faced the camera, held up their identity cards as proof, and then denounced the Syrian regime's deadly crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators. Harmoush claimed to lead this movement from exile in neighboring Turkey. Harmoush, his wife and four children lived in a compound of empty warehouses the Turkish government converted into a makeshift refugee camp in the Turkish border town of Altinozu. Harmoush regularly met with opposition activists and journalists there, until August 29. That morning, Hejazi said her husband walked out of the gates of the camp, which are protected by Turkish police. Soon after, she said he disappeared and his phone stopped answering calls. ""From that moment, I was certain my husband was handed back to the Syrians,"" Hejazi recalled. After going missing for more than two weeks, Harmoush suddenly resurfaced... this time in a ""confession"" aired on Syria's strictly-controlled state television network. In the September 15 broadcast, Harmoush recanted his support for the opposition. He denied ever receiving orders from commanding officers to open fire on demonstrators. And he accused the opposition Muslim Brotherhood of smuggling weapons and terrorists to Syria. Harmoush has not been seen or heard from since. Hejazi believes he is now in Syrian custody. ""I can't live in a fantasy and pretend as if I'm blind or deaf and say it's not true,"" she said. It is still a mystery how Harmoush disappeared from the gates of a police-protected Turkish refugee camp and ended up on Syrian state television. Hejazi and some other opposition activists blame the Turkish government. ""I talked to him [Harmoush] on the morning of August 29th,"" said exiled Syrian activist Omar al Muqdad, in an interview with CNN on September 16. ""He said 'I have a meeting with a Turkish security man. When I finish I will call you.' I waited for three days and didn't hear from him."" Hejazi also said her husband left the camp on August 29 planning on meeting with a mysterious man camp residents believed was a Turkish intelligence officer. ""Maybe he's not an intelligence officer as he claimed, but he's one of the Turks,"" Hejazi said. ""We don't know his rank or who the guy is exactly, but over the phone he introduced himself as Abu Mohammed."" Hejazi accused Turkish authorities of handing the rebel officer over to the Syrians. ""I believe they arrested him as part of an agreement between the two countries,"" Hejazi said. The Turkish government has repeatedly denied such accusations. Turkish officials also denied any knowledge of the alleged intelligence officer refugee camp residents knew as ""Abu Mohammed,"" which is a generic Arabic nick-name that means ""father of Mohammed."" Ankara officially states that it welcomes all Syrians on Turkish territory. Turkish officials pointed to the more than 7,500 Syrian refugees that have been fed, clothed and housed for months at a network of government-run camps along the border. Relations between the two neighbors have grown increasingly frosty. Ankara has hosted several Syrian opposition meetings. Turkish leaders have also threatened to punish the Syrian government's ongoing violence against its citizens with sanctions. But in Hatay, the Turkish border province where Harmoush disappeared, there is strong local support for Syrian president Bashar al Assad. The region is home to a large number of ethnic Arabs from the same Allawite sect as Assad, whose family and clan have ruled Syria for more than 40 years. Portraits of the Syrian president sell in Turkish souvenir shops. It is not uncommon to hear locals cursing Syrian anti-government demonstrators. Hejazi said her husband's revolt against Damascus, was fueled partially by the perception that the army's dominant Allawite officer corps discriminated against Harmoush because he was from Syria's majority Sunni Muslim sect. ""Because he was Sunni, they stopped promoting him. They treated him badly,"" Hejazi said. In interviews with CNN, other Sunni officers who joined the ""Free Syrian Army"" also complained bitterly about discrimination at the hands of senior Allawite commanders in the Syrian military. Meanwhile, efforts to track down the missing leader of the ""Free Syrian Army"" have proven fruitless. When Hejazi asked for the help of a lawyer, she said local Turkish officials demanded she first provide documentary evidence that she was in fact married to Harmoush. Those are documents Hejazi cannot provide. ""We left the country without passports,"" Hejazi said. ""According to Syrian law, officers in the Syrian military cannot provide passports to their wife and family. So we don't have passports."" Visibly distraught, Hejazi now finds herself caught in legal limbo between two countries. She said she felt her children were not safe, living in a camp close to the porous border with Syria. After an hour-long conversation, it was clear she did not know whether she should begin mourning for her missing husband. When asked whether she had a message for Harmoush, Hejazi thought for a moment. ""If he is still alive, I urge him to be patient,"" she finally said, adding: ""But I don't think anyone can survive the torture and dungeons of the Syrian secret service. If he's dead, that means he's in paradise."" CNN's Yesim Comert contributed to this report .","Harmoush was the self-styled leader of a rebellion of mutinous soldiers against the Syrian government .

"(CNN) -- Stealth helicopters zoom toward a mystery compound in northern Pakistan, intent on capturing or killing the most wanted man in the world. Under cover of night they reach their target, but within moments one chopper is down and the mission is in jeopardy. The daring raid against Osama bin Laden contained equal parts action, suspense, risk and bravery. In other words (from a purely literary standpoint), all of the elements of a great story. So it should come as no surprise that Simon & Schuster has announced plans to publish a graphic novel about the secret mission, which co-author Jerome Maida describes as a ""complex labyrinth of intrigue, danger and politics."" But it won't be the first graphic novel to recount Operation Neptune Spear (the military name for the raid). That distinction belongs to ""Code Word: Geronimo"" which hit bookstores and Amazon.com less than six months after bin Laden's killing. ""Code Word: Geronimo"" is the work of Capt. Dale Dye, a retired Marine and frequent military consultant on Hollywood films, and his wife Julia Dye, who holds a Ph.D. in the anthropology of human conflict. The novel features the artwork of Gerry Kissell and Amin Amat. CNN spoke with the Dyes about their book and the challenge of telling the story of the raid without divulging military secrets. What follows is an edited version of the conversation. CNN: Why did you decide to tell the story in graphic novel form? Dale Dye: We wanted to reach folks in a sort of 18-35 short attention span demographic and see if we could use the graphic novel to sort of reflect the capability and professionalism of the men and women who pulled this raid off, this Operation Neptune Spear... I think [graphic novels] are a coming thing. I don't know if it's good, bad or indifferent, but it is a venue for communicating and we'll take it. CNN: As military stories go, this one is hard to beat. Dale: I mean it was fantastic. It was nothing like Desert One [the failed attempt in 1980 to free American hostages in Iran] and the other special operations efforts in which we haven't done so well. This one was really almost perfect, and that's hard to say when you're dealing deep behind people's lines. CNN: Tell me about the research you did for the book. Julia Dye: The challenge in this case wasn't so much digging up the information, it's that there was too much information and often conflicting. So it's discernment, how do you decide what is the most appropriate, what is most likely, what is true from a variety of sources. Dale: I was able to call some people in the special operations community that I have contacts with and draw on my own background and sort of fill in what gaps Julia left where we didn't know... There are some areas in which I like to say we used ""SWAG"", which is ""Scientific Wild- A** Guesses"". CNN: Were you concerned at all about revealing sensitive information in the book? Dale: We did a lot of talking, Julia and I did, ""If we do this, if we say this, if we depict this, are we giving away the secrets to the bad guys?"" Julia: There are certainly operational concerns and we wanted to make sure the information that is in there was appropriate... and keep what should remain classified, classified and still tell a compelling story. CNN: There are some panels in the graphic novel showing bin Laden in bed the night of the raid, without a turban. How did you decide the right way to depict his domestic life? Dale: That's one of those ""SWAG"" things. Nobody really knows what his domestic life was about. So we put it together and we said, ""Given what we know about him, or what we purport to know about him, what would his private life be like?"" In large measure, it seemed to us it would be like anybody else's in the Muslim community. There was a woman in bed with him and he was undressed and he was the domestic Osama bid Laden, if you will. And so that's the way we depicted it. CNN: A canine was part of the Navy SEAL team that stormed the bin Laden compound. Do you know what became of Cairo the dog? Dale: As far we know Cairo is still out there operating with his handler and with members of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group. He's one of many K9s that they use. I don't know that Cairo got a medal or a bone or any special plate of dog food, but we're dog lovers and we considered him to be a hero and Julia would have broken my neck if we hadn't put him in there. CNN: In a couple of the panels Cairo is wearing goggles. Julia: Doggles, they're called Doggles, no they really exist. There is a civilian type you can buy. But they actually have night-vision capabilities and lots of great nifty things in there. Dale: They can put the K9 cam on him so that you can see what he sees and he has a little flak jacket that he wears, body armor, and maybe even little boots that K9s can wear to keep on their feet, the pads of their paws to keep them from burning on concrete and that sort of thing. They've gone a long way with the pooches. CNN: Tell me about your collaboration with the illustrators. Dale: A graphic novel is a challenge in itself. Because while I write words and essentially design what happens in the storyline, the artists, Gerry Kissel and his partner Amin [Amat] are trying to get inside your emotional storyteller brain and say 'What would that picture look like?' And so there was a lot of backing and forthing... That's where [my] military background really comes in. We know what things look like, we know what they're supposed to look like so it's not ""Captain Marvel attacks the Martians,"" this is the real deal. CNN: Director Kathryn Bigelow (""The Hurt Locker"") is working on a movie about SEAL Team 6, the counterterrorism unit that conducted the raid. Do you think that project is in good hands? Dale: She's a brilliant director and did such a great job with ""The Hurt Locker."" I hope she gets it right, I hope she knocks it out of the ballpark. The problem with [depicting] the global war on terrorism is that it's still going on. It's very close to people. You guys [the media] stuff it into our face 24 hours a day. It's virtually the thing that fills the news hole. So it's difficult to back off and get some perspective and tell a story. Julia: I think it would be wonderful to have films in the future that advance wonderful stories from the war on terror. I think many of them up to now have a tendency to advance agendas rather than stories. Dale: That's one of the reasons why we wanted to do the graphic novel now. I mean it hits a mid-ground between that big definitive book that some enterprising reporter is going to do and the movie maybe that Kathryn Bigelow will do. This is a mid-ground. It's got pictures and it's got a story. And it's got some really vital information in it. CNN: Finally, what are your thoughts about the people who pulled off this raid? Dale: We're talking about some of the most selfless, really true professional public servants the world will ever know. These are folks who aren't in it for medals, they aren't in it for glamor, they aren't in it for prestige, they aren't in it for notoriety. They're in it because they believe it's the right thing to do, because they think it's an important and vital mission. That was our mission when we started out [writing the graphic novel], to reflect some light, some glory, without ripping away the veil of secrecy, but reflect some light and glory on truly professional, dedicated, patriotic men and women.","Capt.

"(CNN) -- Famed boxer Manny Pacquiao prepared to square off Saturday against Juan Manuel Marquez, hoping to retain his championship and affirm his supremacy after controversy surrounded their first two bouts. Pacquiao, who also serves as a representative in the Filipino Congress, is regarded by many as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world and has won 53 of his 58 career fights. Marquez, though, insists he should have been declared the winner in their two clashes to date. The two look to settle the score Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The Filipino entered the bout having won 10 titles at eight different weight divisions in his glittering career, from flyweight (for boxers between 108 and 112 pounds) up to super welterweight (148 to 154 pounds). The Ring magazine, among other publications, ranks Pacquiao as the world's best pound-for-pound boxer. That said, there's some doubt about his supremacy over Marquez. The first bout in 2004 was scored as a draw, while Pacquiao won a split decision in the rematch four years later. The Mexican has been seen sporting a T-shirt that says ""Marquez beat Pacquiao twice!!"" and claims he will put the record straight when they step into the ring for the third time. ""Everyone, including many of my countrymen, believe he (Pacquiao) really won those fights,"" Marquez said through an interpreter. Pacquiao though, said prior to Saturday's contest that the third chapter will resolve the debate once and for all. ""He kept on saying he got robbed in the first two fights. This fight will answer all the doubts and all the questions,"" he said at a news conference in Las Vegas. If Pacquiao defeats Marquez, the next big fight for the General Santos City native could be a long awaited showdown with Floyd Mayweather Jr., the other superstar of his boxing generation.","Manny Pacquiao will fight Juan Manuel Marquez in Las Vegas .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A Mexican mayor campaigning for the president's sister in a gubernatorial race was fatally shot in the southeastern state of Michoacan, the state attorney general's office said. The killing of La Piedad Mayor Ricardo Guzman Romero on Wednesday is the latest in a number of mayoral killings dating to last year. According to CNNMexico, 18 mayors have been killed in 2010 and 2011. But Guzman's death garnered extra attention because he was killed in President Felipe Calderon's home state, and because he was campaigning for the president's sister, gubernatorial candidate Luisa Maria Calderon. She is running as a candidate for the National Action Party, or PAN, the same party to which the president belongs. The attack came just 11 days before the state elections, where in addition to a governor, 40 lawmakers and 113 mayors will be chosen. Guzman was elected mayor in 2008, and his term was to end in January. ""At the moment, the federal authorities and military are in charge (of the case),"" Michoacan attorney general's office spokesman Armando Soto La Marina said. According to authorities, Guzman was participating in a campaign event, walking down one of his town's boulevards, when a black vehicle approached and a gunman shot from inside. The shooter escaped, and the mayor was taken to a hospital, where he died, authorities said. Luisa Maria Calderon said she was saddened by the killing, but that ""we're not going to stop our fight for Michoacan."" Michoacan has long been a center of drug cartel violence. It was where President Calderon initiated his campaign against the cartels in 2006. Last year, the PAN and an allied party declined to run candidates in at least 20 mayoral races in Michoacan because of insecurity.","Ricardo Guzman Romero was killed on Wednesday .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Pregnancy joy turned to sadness for the stars of TLC's ""The Little Couple,"" as they learned on Tuesday's episode of the successful transfer of an embryo to their surrogate, who later miscarried their unborn child. Dr. Jennifer Arnold and husband Bill Klein, who both have skeletal dysplasia, a bone-growth disorder that causes dwarfism, have documented their road to parenthood on the show. They decided to use a surrogate to have a baby, because of the challenges a pregnancy could pose to her health. On the season finale, Arnold and Klein learned their surrogate was expecting. ""After we got pregnant, the craziness ensued with us wondering what to do with the baby's room, making sure our surrogate was getting her daily dose of baby vitamins,"" Klein tells PEOPLE. But since filming their happy visit to the doctor, the couple's surrogate lost the pregnancy. Klein had to contact his wife, a neonatologist at Texas Children's Hospital, while she was at work in order to tell her the heartbreaking news. ""I didn't want her to be the last person to find out,"" he says. ""Ugly or happy, it needs to be told. It was a very tough day, and Jen took it harder than she originally expected."" ""I cried my eyes out,"" Arnold tells PEOPLE. ""I deal with families who lose their babies and I will cry with them, but I thought I would be stronger. Nothing can completely prepare for all that when it is about you."" When the couple were able to get together at the end of the day, they mourned, crying and comforting one another and later talking to family and friends. The next day they decided they would continue trying to start a family, with both surrogacy and adoption as possible paths. Kim Kardashian's Marriage: Mistake or Fake? ""Bill was a rock, and he held me through everything,"" Arnold says. ""By the next morning, I realized that I needed to try again. We were so close and so pregnant with the ultrasound looking good, and so it was horrible for it to end. But I couldn't have said I was done. A lot of family asked, 'Do you want to go through this again?' And my answer is, yes. I would be miserable if I didn't try again."" A Rocky Road . Because both Klein and Arnold carry a single gene for their type of skeletal dysplasia, there is a chance they could both pass the gene on to their child, which could be lethal for their baby. To avoid this, embryos are genetically tested before implantation. If no skeletal dysplasia genes are passed on, the baby would be healthy and average sized; if one gene is passed, the baby would be a healthy little person. Also, Jen is on medication to stimulate her ovaries, which produced only half as many eggs as expected. ""We appreciated all the prayers and positive thinking,"" says Arnold of sharing her difficult story with the world. ""That is comforting and is giving us strength. When we lost the pregnancy, we wondered how we were going to handle it. But by sharing our story, whether it be positive or negative, I think it can help others going through similar things."" Ultimately, becoming parents is what means the most. ""We are so in love with each other and supportive of each other that we are going to be okay,"" she says. ""We really want to be parents, and that is the goal here through surrogacy and adoption. We are not done trying yet."" Kris Jenner: 'People Have to Stop Judging' Kim for Ending Her Marriage . Until that day comes, Klein cherishes life with his wife. ""I could go the next 50 or 100 years with just the two of us, because we have a great relationship,"" he says. ""Few people are so lucky to have that from the moment you meet that one person, and everything we add to our relationship is exciting."" Challenges -- both past and future -- will only make their bond stronger. ""We really just feel crazy fortunate to have found each other,"" Arnold says. ""We were both at a point of giving up. Being a little person, everything is a struggle, and it is wonderful when you achieve something you really wanted. You don't let that go so easily.""

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- A Filipino-American woman abducted in July in the Philippines was found Sunday on an island stronghold of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf, police said. Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, 43, was found at Suba Kampong township on the Philippine island of Basilan after her captors released her, said Bienvenido Latag of the Philippine National Police. The U.S. Embassy in Manila on Monday confirmed Lunsmann's release in Basilan after she was held hostage by a still unidentified group of bandits. Latag did not say why Lunsmann was released, but the mayor of the town where Lunsmann was taken after she was released said she was freed following negotiations between her husband and her abductors. Mayor Cesar Lobregat, head of a Crisis Management Committee in Zamboanga City, declined to confirm whether officials paid a ransom. Fourteen gunmen snatched Lunsmann in July while she was vacationing with her family on the island of Tictabon, authorities said. The gunmen also took hostage Lunsmann's 14-year-old son, Kevin, and her 19-year-old Filipino nephew, Romnick Jakaria, they said. Authorities said the abductors forced Lunsmann and her family to board awaiting boats, which then sped off in the direction of Basilan. It was not immediately known whether the captors are still holding Lunsmann's son and nephew. Lunsmann was adopted by Americans when she was 9 and grew up in Virginia. She eventually married a German citizen. Both she and the son, Kevin, are U.S. passport holders. Police at the time of the abduction said they suspected the son attracted attention because of his distinctive mixed-race looks in an area with few foreign tourists. Basilan serves as a base for Abu Sayyaf, which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines' minority Muslim population. The U.S. State Department considers the group a terrorist organization and says it is linked to al Qaeda. The Philippines government has been fighting to contain the militants. Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead, as well as past kidnappings.","Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann was released on Basilan island .

"(CNN) -- Remember the iPod Nano and iPod Touch? They'll be getting some feature and style upgrades, as well as some price-slashing, in the near future. Although the iPods were largely overshadowed by Tuesday's iPhone 4S news, Apple CEO Tim Cook also announced a handful of tweaks to Apple's iconic music-player line -- in plenty of time, of course, for the holiday shopping season. The new Touch, now the most popular iPod, will be available in both black and white and get a $30 price cut, to $199 for 8GB of storage, $299 for 32 gigs and $399 for 64. It will also run Apple's new iOS5 operating system, meaning its ability to run apps, surf the Web and the like will maintain its unofficial status as the iPhone-without-a-phone. The new Touch ships on October 12. The Nano, perhaps appropriately, is getting an even smaller update. The most fun change will be Apple's addition of 16 new clock faces for folks who use the tiny player's 1.5-inch screen as a watch. Our favorite? The iconic Mickey Mouse watch is now available, with Mickey's hands spinning around to tell the time. It's also getting a price cut, down to $129 for the 8GB version and $149 for 16GB. The runt of the litter, the 2GB Nano, goes for a mere $49. (Virtually free by Apple's standards, if still more expensive than some rival mp3 players with the same limited storage space). Totally lost in the shuffle (see what we did there?) was any mention at all of the iPod Classic or ... Shuffle. The two didn't get a single mention at Tuesday's event, just as they were left out in the cold at last year's iPod event. That's led to lots of stories in the tech press speculating that the clock is ticking toward the demise of the two venerable players. (You know ... even if this one, from The Unofficial Apple Weblog, was dead wrong). But Apple's online store Wednesday showed both devices still for sale. It's clear Apple wants to move completely to touchscreen and abandon the old-fashioned click wheel on the Classic and Shuffle (the Nano's click wheel disappeared last year). Time will tell how long the older devices last, although for our money there's still something to be said for the top-of-the-line Classic, with its massive 160 gigabytes of storage, as a repository for folks' entire music collection. Music and other media content got another boost Tuesday with Apple announcing plans that could move iTunes into the cloud. The iCloud service will now be integrated into the iOS 5 operating system. It will work with apps and allow content to be stored on remote servers instead of the users' iPod, iPhone or other device. Each device will get 5GB of free storage, according to Cook. Working with iTunes, the cloud-based service would let a user access their music, videos and the like from any Apple device running iOS5.","iPods, while overshadowed by the iPhone 4S, got freshened up by Apple .

"(CNN) -- The iPhone 4S -- Apple's newest creation -- quietly went on pre-sale at 12 a.m. on Friday. The homepage of the company's website, however, remained a dedication to the company's co-founder, Steve Jobs, who died on Wednesday after a history of pancreatic cancer. The phone, which has been panned by some critics who say it's more of a facelift to the iPhone 4 than a new product, features a faster dual-core processor and a camera with 8 megapixels of resolution. It also has a ""humble personal assistant"" named Siri, which responds to voice commands and talks back to you. Apple's new CEO, Tim Cook, unveiled the phone on Tuesday, a day before Jobs' death was announced. The phone's price ranges from $200 to $400 with a two-year wireless contract. It's available on AT&T, Verizon and, for the first time, on Sprint's network. The iPhone 4S goes on sale in stores on October 14 in the following countries: United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the UK.

"(CNN) -- Are Democrats beginning to reconsider their vote in the 2008 Democratic primary? With the nation's economy -- and arguably its politics -- in shambles, it is not very surprising to find in a recent Bloomberg poll that 34% of respondents think it would have been better for the country if Hillary Clinton hadn't lost the battle for the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama. A CNN poll released last week put Clinton's favorability rating at a tremendous 69%. Perhaps no one is questioning the 2008 results more than Democratic politicians who must face the voters next year. Right now, it looks like President Obama, rather than offering coattails to those below him on the ticket, may instead be serving up an anchor. This is ironic, when you look back at what actually happened during the Democrats' 2008 primary, and at who made Obama the party's nominee. It is often assumed that Barack Obama used his gifts as an orator and his aspirational rhetoric to energize young and minority voters in a way that allowed him to wrest the nomination from Clinton, the candidate favored by the Democratic establishment. This is a nice story, but it is not completely true. For one thing, Clinton actually defeated Obama in the popular vote. Still, one has to be careful not to read too much into this, since Clinton's very narrow lead depends on counting votes from Michigan. Because Michigan refused to abide by Democratic Party rules when scheduling its primary, Obama had pulled his name off that state's ballot. It does not really matter who won the popular vote, however, because the Democratic Party does not select its nominee only through a direct election. To become the party's standard-bearer, a candidate must capture the votes of a majority of the more than 4,000 delegates who are selected to attend the party's national convention. Although delegates are awarded in part based on the votes that they receive, neither Clinton nor Obama captured enough delegates through their primary and caucus showings to secure the nomination. Indeed, in 2008, Democratic Party rules made such a feat almost impossible. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats don't allow states to award their delegates on a winner-take-all basis. This makes it difficult for candidates who are neck-and-neck to pull away from each other in delegate counts. Adding to this problem is that approximately 20% of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are not tied to the results of primary contests. Party rules stipulate that more than 800 seats at the convention belong to a group defined as ""Party Leaders and Elected Officials."" These so-called ""superdelegates"" are not formally pledged to any candidates and attend the convention regardless of primary and caucus results. Indeed, it appears that the real brilliance of the Obama campaign was to realize fairly early that a true majority was not achievable. In response to this fact, and having an edge in the early caucus states due to superior grass-roots organizing, the Obama campaign subtly changed the understanding of the rules.  It acted as if the nomination would be determined by the delegate count after the caucuses and primaries, regardless of whether an absolute majority had been achieved. What this did was to lower the overall number by more than 800 votes (the superdelegates), and consequently change the threshold of victory. Since most Americans are unfamiliar with how the nominating process works, this was a fairly easy story to sell. The press for the most part cooperated. Once this fiction was accepted, any other result would be seen as undemocratic. Indeed, Clinton's complaints about this unofficial after-the-fact rules change were portrayed as a divisive form of sour grapes. After all, following Sen. Obama's post-Super Tuesday February romp through 10 states, it became obvious that Sen. Clinton would not be able to win under this new threshold. Ultimately, and most importantly, the elected and unelected leaders of the Democratic Party accepted the Obama campaign's spin. This was crucial to Obama's success, since a real victory at the convention depended on these superdelegates ignoring the fact that Clinton was the stronger general election candidate in swing states like Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio. In the end, it was the endorsement of these superdelegates -- again, party leaders and elected officials -- that forced Clinton to concede the nomination. The irony of all this should now be clear. According to a recent CNN poll, only Republican Mitt Romney appears to be in a position to offer a strong challenge to Obama in 2012. Unfortunately for the Republican Party, Romney's nomination is anything but certain. The results of the 2010 midterms, however, when combined with recent special election results, indicate that, with Obama at the top of the ticket, the prospects for many other Democratic elected officials are rather dismal. Of course, a lot of these politicians have no one to blame but themselves. I suspect, nonetheless, that they are feeling more than a twinge of buyer's remorse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Sracic.","Paul Sracic: Are Democrats now reconsidering their vote in the 2008 Democratic primary?

"(CNN) -- Bahraini authorities on Sunday explicitly tied the recent arrests of alleged ""terrorist cell"" members with Iran, claiming the suspects got funding from that Middle Eastern nation and had ties to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Basij, according to a state media report. A day earlier, a Bahrain Ministry of Interior spokesman said authorities had arrested five people for allegedly planning attacks against -- among other targets -- the interior ministry building, the King Fahad Causeway and Saudi Arabia's embassy in Manama. On Sunday, a spokesman for the public prosecution office -- which has taken over the investigation from the interior ministry -- offered new details about the alleged plotters. Much of the new information was derived from what the official Bahrain News Agency describes as ""confessions made by some of the accused gangsters."" The BNA report stated the alleged terrorists had connected with ""militant elements in (Iran's) Revolutionary Guard"" and Basij, the volunteer paramilitary group allied with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Bahrain prosecutor's spokesman claimed the suspected terrorists planning, and operations, were dependent on ""foreign financing."" The BNA report specifically referenced money that one suspect supposedly got during a visit to Iran. Another report, released early Monday by Iran's state-run Press TV, described the arrests and Bahraini claims as ""anti-Iran political theater."" ""Manama has made similar allegations on a number of occasions, and every time Iran has denied all the charges,"" the Press TV report said. A Bahrain interior ministry spokesman had earlier said, in a statement, that Qatari security authorities initially arrested four Bahrainis who had entered Qatar from neighboring Saudi Arabia. The suspects were carrying documents and a laptop ""containing sensitive security information and details about some places and vital establishments in Bahrain, as well as airline bookings to Syria,"" the spokesman's statement said. The suspects were also carrying a ""significant"" amount of U.S. and Iranian currency, the spokesman said. The Qatari Security Authority learned that the four suspects left Bahrain ""after being incited by others to head to Iran,"" and then they passed through Qatar and Syria ""to establish a group that carries out armed terrorist operations in Bahrain,"" the spokesman's statement said. The four defendants provided information about a fifth suspect in Bahrain, who was also arrested, Bahraini authorities said.","NEW: State-run Iranian media describes the report as ""anti-Iran political theater""

"(CNN) -- Heavy rain that has killed at least 60 people in Central America is not expected to let up soon, authorities said Monday. El Salvador is the country hit hardest so far. The government has declared a state of emergency and ordered evacuations. At least 32 people have died in El Salvador, including several children, according to the country's civil protection director. Some were swept away attempting to cross swollen rivers, while others were killed when the walls of their homes collapsed. ""The temporary evacuation of the population in some parts of the country is meant to avoid casualties caused by mudslides,"" said Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes, who also ordered the cancellation of school classes. In Guatemala, the death toll stands at 28 and close to 110,000 people have been affected by the rain. President Alvaro Colom said that 15,000 more people are at risk and roughly 12,000 are in shelters, according to a statement on his website. ""We're praying to God for help,"" said Celida Yesenia Lopez, a Guatemalan flood survivor who lost her home. ""It's very sad."" Honduras was similarly struck.

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's former President Jiang Zemin appeared in Beijing on Sunday, the first time he's been seen publicly since rumors surfaced months ago that he had died. Jiang, 85, was among many current and former dignitaries attending a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of China's 1911 revolution, which led to the toppling of the Qing Dynasty. China became a Communist state in 1949, under the leadership of Mao Zedong. At the start of the ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, live footage on China's state-run television showed Jiang for a few seconds as he walked on the stage, closely followed by an assistant. In another segment, Jiang appears to sing along with others during the playing of the Chinese national anthem. Death rumors spur reflections on Jiang legacy . Former Chinese premier Li Peng was also in the crowd, among other retired party and government leaders. So were active government ministers, private entrepreneurs and Beijing-based ambassadors from other countries. In the event's keynote speech, current President Hu Jintao extolled the ""thoroughly modern, national and democratic revolution"" of 1911. And among other stances, he urged mainland China and Taiwan to work together for a ""peaceful reunification of China,"" according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Reaching an accord with Taiwan had been one of Jiang's focuses in his tenure as president, during which he made conciliatory overtures to the island nation including a ""One Country, Two Systems"" proposal. It was one of many efforts he pursued in his time, between 1989 and 2002, as the general-secretary of China's Communist Party and, from 1993 to 2003, as the nation's president. As China's ruler, he generally pushed market reforms while working to keep the country politically and socially conservative. China's economy boomed under his leadership, growing at an annual average rate of over 9%. China also regained control of Hong Kong in 1997 and Macau in 1999, while national pride soared in 2000 when Beijing was picked to host the 2008 Summer Olympics. With rare exceptions, Jiang largely has been out of the public eye in recent years. This summer, Chinese authorities dismissed as ""pure rumors"" reports that he was on his death bed.","Jiang Zemin appears at a ceremony marking China's 1911 revolution .

"Cancun, Mexico (CNN) -- The storm known as Rina fizzled Friday as it moved over the Yucatan Channel, the strait between Mexico and Cuba, the National Hurricane Center said. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect after Rina lost much of its punch. The storm had diminished in strength from a Category 2 hurricane that raised fears in and around some of the most popular resort communities in Mexico. It was classified as a remnant low Friday afternoon, with maximum sustained winds of 30 miles an hour, the hurricane center said. Rina's eye was about 75 miles west of the western tip of Cuba and 110 miles north-northeast of Cozumel, moving east-northeast at 5 mph. ""A turn toward the southeast is expected on Saturday, with a turn toward the south expected on Sunday,"" the hurricane center said in what was its last public advisory on the system. Continued weakening is forecast for the next two days. Rina had been expected to drop between 3 to 6 inches of rain over the eastern part of the Yucatan Peninsula and Cozumel through Friday, with isolated amounts of up to 10 inches, according to the Miami-based weather agency. A storm surge of as much as 1 to 2 feet above normal tide levels along the coast was also expected, ""accompanied by large and dangerous waves,"" forecasters had said. Authorities took precautionary measures ahead of the storm, while numerous businesses in Cancun and elsewhere shut down. ""First we're thinking, we're stranded in Cancun; there could be worse things,"" said Amelie Jarvis, a tourist from Canada. ""But then we noticed that everything is closed.

"(CNN) -- What's white and black, and has people fawning all over? Meet Siku, a polar bear cub born in captivity in Denmark. The cute cub is being reared by handlers at the Scandinavian Wildlife Park because his mother isn't producing the milk to feed him. Since his birth last month, Siku has become a Web star. He has his own page on the park's website and he's even on Facebook. Park director Frank Vigh-Larsen says he's stunned by the cub's rapid transformation into an Internet sensation. Video footage posted on YouTube of Siku bottle-feeding, rolling around and snoozing has been viewed more than 2 million times in six days, he told CNN, and the cub gained thousands of friends on Facebook within the space of a few hours. As of Wednesday, at 36 days old, Siku has just opened his eyes and weighs in at 4.2 kilograms (9.2 pounds), more than five times his initial weight, his handler said. ""He's just a little solid cannonball,"" Vigh-Larsen said. ""He's doing well."" Such growth is a testament to the dedicated care Siku is receiving. For the first three weeks, Vigh-Larsen fed the cub every two hours -- and still feeds him every three hours, meaning the keeper gets little sleep. In the new year, two other wildlife keepers will start to care for him, too, in shifts, making sure the cub is never alone during the first 12 months of his life. Siku's popularity comes at a time when concern over the plight of polar bears is at an peak. Corporate giant Coca-Cola recently launched a campaign in conjunction with the World Wildlife Fund to raise awareness about the threat of climate change to polar bears' Arctic habitat. And Vigh-Larsen is determined Siku -- whose name means ""sea ice"" in Greenlandic, an Eskimo language spoken in Greenland -- will thrive so he can play a role in highlighting the risk. Polar bears rely on sea ice in the Arctic to hunt. ""Siku is going to be an ambassador for polar bears, for global warming,"" he said. Vigh-Larsen draws a contrast with the last polar bear cub to become an Internet star, Germany's Knut. That bear died suddenly at age 4 last March at Zoo Berlin, to the sorrow of many worldwide who had followed the cub's progress after he was abandoned by his mother and hand-raised by a zookeeper. The case of Knut was a disaster, Vigh-Larsen said, ""because he was only ever used for selling tickets and teddy bears."" Siku will have a different mission, he says: using his cuteness to persuade people to listen to warnings about climate change and take steps to protect their planet. It could prove a powerful weapon. The cub has already appeared on front pages of newspapers around the world and graced international TV news bulletins. New pictures will be posted on the Wildlife Park's website Thursday, Vigh-Larsen said, with the pictures likely to win him even more fans. Vigh-Larsen also hopes that the facilities the huge park can offer will make it possible for Siku to join its four other polar bears -- including Siku's mother -- as a normal adult male in three or four years' time, despite being bottle-reared. This is doubly important because of a shortage of polar bears for breeding programs in captivity -- set to become ever more important as the numbers in the wild drop. Scientists believe there could be as few as 25,000 polar bears left in the world, according to Polar Bears International, a conservation group. The animals are only found in five nations: the United States (Alaska), Russia, Norway, Canada and Greenland, the group said. In 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the polar bear as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Without action, Vigh-Larsen says, research suggests that there could be no polar bears at all in the wild within 40 years. He hopes Siku can help reverse that course.","Siku is being bottle-reared because his mother cannot produce enough milk .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin blamed the United States Thursday for encouraging opposition protests that have broken out since parliamentary elections Sunday. His accusation followed comments by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this week on Russia's election in which she called for a ""full investigation"" of apparent irregularities. The United States had ""serious concerns about the conduct of the election,"" she said, at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) in Europe Tuesday. Speaking on state TV, Putin said Clinton had criticized the elections as ""neither fair not free -- even before receiving reports from international observers."" This had sent a signal to opposition figures, Putin said, who ""with the support of the U.S. State Department"" then began ""active work."" He told representatives of his All-Russian People's Front movement there was a difference between criticism from within the country and by outside players, and he said Russia should defend itself against ""foreign interference."" Demonstrators have been protesting against what they describe as electoral fraud in Sunday's national vote, which kept Putin's United Russia party in power but significantly decreased the number of seats it holds in Parliament. More than 20,000 people have signed up via Facebook for a protest in Moscow called ""Saturday in Revolution Square."" If it goes ahead as foreseen, it would be one of the largest opposition protests in the Russian capital in years. Rallies are also being planned via Facebook in more than 90 other Russian cities Saturday, as well as in London, New York, Kiev, Ukraine, Paris, Geneva, Switzerland and Stockholm, Sweden. In his remarks, Putin said that ""if people are acting within law, they should be given a right to express their opinion,"" but he said the authorities should take action ""by legal means"" if they do breach the rules. Speaking in Europe Thursday, Clinton stood by her comments, while recognizing the value the United States places on its relationship with Russia and the ""real progress"" made in a number of areas. But, she added: ""At the same time, the U.S. and others have a strong commitment to democracy and human rights, it's part of who we are, our values, and we expressed concerns we thought were well-founded about the conduct of the elections and we are supportive of the rights of the Russian people to realize a better future for themselves."" The OSCE also raised concerns over the conduct of the election in a preliminary report, saying some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was ""slanted in favor of the ruling party."" A draft report by the organization's election-observer mission detailed alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes, manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors. The group, which monitors and promotes democracy and human rights, cited the lack of an independent body running the election or impartial news media. There was also ""undue interference of state authorities"" in the vote, the 56-nation organization said in a statement. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton gave her backing to the OSCE observers' findings in a statement Wednesday, and she said she expected Russia to act on them. She also voiced concern about the detention of hundreds of protesters following the election and ""reports of police violence against activists, journalists and bystanders."" Criticism of the electoral process has also come from within Russia. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, called Wednesday for new parliamentary elections in Russia over concerns about vote fraud. Spokesman Pavel Palezhchenko told CNN Gorbachev was ""very concerned about how the situation in Russia is developing"" and that the Russian people did not believe their will was reflected in the results. But Margot Light, professor emeritus of international relations at the London School of Economics, said it was highly unlikely that any notice would be taken of Gorbachev's call. ""They won't re-run the election,"" she said, suggesting the Russian authorities would instead probably run a case-by-case investigation where there have been specific complaints of irregularities. Russia's election law does have an appeals procedure in such cases, she said. While she considers Putin's accusation of U.S. interference to be rhetoric, there is a widespread fear of Western interference in elections. This dates back to the so-called ""color revolutions"" in Georgia and Ukraine, when Russia believed Western non-government organizations and governments were behind opposition protests, she said. Light suggested Putin will be able to blame failings in the electoral process and United Russia's relatively poor performance on President Dmitry Medvedev, who is ""damaged goods"" since Putin announced he would run for president again next year. The election outcome may have given Putin a ""great fright"" ahead of the presidential election in March 2012, she said, but at the same time there is no other credible candidate to challenge him, so the chances of him losing, even without falsification of the results, is very small. Many democratic nations are governed by parties, like United Russia, who have won a plurality of the vote, rather than an absolute majority, she added. Opponents of Putin have vowed to continue protesting the parliamentary election results despite the arrests of at least 250 demonstrators Tuesday. A planned opposition rally in Moscow failed to materialize Wednesday, however, with a heavy security presence in the square where thousands of demonstrators were expected to march, but no visible protesters. Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement Wednesday that Russian authorities ""must halt police mistreatment of election protesters, journalists and detainees"" before further planned rallies. Amnesty said more than 1,000 people, including journalists, had reportedly been detained following election protests, of whom possibly more than 100 remain in detention. It had received numerous reports of mistreatment of detainees and beatings of peaceful protesters by police, the group said, with some denied medical treatment. Police said 8,000 people had turned out for a separate demonstration in support of Putin's United Russia party. As simmering anger over allegations of official corruption and economic stagnation appear to be boiling over, Putin has promised to make changes, including reshuffling his Cabinet. He has said the losses his party suffered in Sunday's elections were inevitable. CNN's Alla Eshchenko in Moscow, and senior State Department producer Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Clinton says the U.S. values its relationship with Russia but is committed to democracy .

"(CNN) -- It has been more than 65 years, but for 93-year-old Anthony Snetro, the image of a Japanese torpedo bomber closing in on him will never go away. Snetro still has vivid memories of the day his life flashed before his eyes. ""Our ship was starting to swing around,"" Snetro softly recalls. ""All of a sudden, here comes a Jap torpedo bomber all aflame right at my eye level. I could have reached out and touched the wing."" Snetro joined the U.S. Navy in 1942 and was immediately assigned to serve aboard the USS Boston in the South Pacific. He hoped enlisting in the Navy would prevent his younger brother from being drafted. ""Let him stay home to help the family,"" Snetro recalls. ""That's why I joined the Navy, I was 25 years old. But finally near the end, they drafted him. He was wounded in Germany but made it home OK."" Snetro was a machinist in the Navy during World War II. Although he had experienced many terrifying moments during his four years in the service, nothing compared to that October night during the Battle of Formosa in 1944. Up until now, the World War II veteran has shared the experience of that frightening night with only one other person, his son. ""Plainly, I saw the pilot and the gunner in there,"" Snetro explains as his voice gets louder. ""The plane was afire. Good thing we were swinging. It just missed us and went along and crashed in the ocean and exploded."" Two other cruisers, the Canberra and the Houston, had already been aerial torpedoed the previous two nights. ""I know one thing, I was really scared there,"" Snetro recalls, slowly shaking his head as his eyes grow wider. ""I couldn't do anything. I was stupefied. I was frozen."" iReport and Facebook team up to honor veterans . The four years that Snetro served were extremely stressful, he says. The heavy cruiser would be at sea for months at a time before finally pulling into port for supplies. When out at sea, there was always a concern, especially during war time. ""We never knew how close we came to being torpedoed, "" Snetro says. ""The engine room was down below the water. You get hit with a torpedo and you're done."" Snetro realized he needed something to help cope with the dangers of war. He decided to turn to a sport he had been playing since age 10. ""We'd get a few hours off on the beach,"" Snetro says. ""We had equipment, softballs, bats, different things. A bunch of guys would get together and we'd start a little game. It was just for fun. You got a little relaxed."" Playing ball helped him during the unnerving days of World War II and it has helped him ever since. Snetro hopes to continue playing ball for at least a couple more years. ""I enjoy playing ball. It makes me feel good. Seeing my age, I can still run around."" he says, smiling. ""I can't play like I used to, but I get a hit once in a while."" ""Baseball was something that you could keep playing. Just my luck, I came down here (Coral Gables, Florida) and they had a team and I've been playing ever since. It's been great! Otherwise, I'd be sitting at home in a rocking chair!""","Anthony Snetro was a machinist in the Navy during World War II .

"(CNN) -- Thai authorities on Monday moved to ease fears that the devastating floods that have engulfed much of the country will swamp the capital. The country's Flood Relief Operation Command (FROC) reported that flood defense measures in low-lying Bangkok have held and that the bloated Chao Praya River has not risen any further. There had been fears that further heavy rain over the weekend combined with the spring high tides would overwhelm parts of the city. ""The water situation in Bangkok city is no longer a worry and today is the end of the high tide period,"" FROC spokesperson Wim Rungwattanachinda told CNN. However, Irrigation department director general Chalit Damrongsak warned the situation remained critical as water from low-lying areas north of Bangkok still needed to drain. ""It is not over,"" he said, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse. So far, 307 people have been killed during months of monsoon rains across Thailand, with more than 8.6 million in 61 provinces affected by the rising floodwater. Asia's wet and wild summer explained . More than 500,000 square kilometers -- an area the size of Spain -- have been affected by the floods in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, according to CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. In the ancient city of Ayutthara, one of the worst-hit areas, officials said the floodwater was starting to recede and flow towards the rivers. The temples and monuments in the UNESCO-listed historical city have been submerged for days, prompting concern that much of the water damage will be permanent. Meanwhile, a massive effort is underway to protect the Navanakorn Industrial Park to the north of Bangkok. The giant complex -- one of Thailand's largest -- houses a number of companies that produce electronics and components for the automotive industry. According to the Bangkok Post, 600 workers, civilian volunteers and soldiers were working around the clock Sunday to strengthen defense walls on all sides of the facility as the water continued to rise. Other manufacturing sites north of Bangkok, such as Rojana Industrial Park, were forced to halt operations as the floodwater hit. Honda last week said the closure of its plant there affected the production of at least 4,500 cars. The Thai finance ministry says overall damage from the floods could be more than $2 billion, with the worst yet still possibly to come,"" according to CNN's Paula Hancocks. Floods are an annual occurrence in the country but it has been particularly acute this year. Thais across the country are donating food, water and clothing to help the worst-hit areas. Authorities said donations have far surpassed previous years. The government said that it has received $2.07 million in donations, including help from other countries, by Sunday. The United States said it is sending 26 helicopters to help the relief effort, invaluable as more roads turn to rivers and become impassable. United Nations agencies also are on standby, while the World Health Organization has offered emergency health kits. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","There were fears further heavy rain combined with high tides would overwhelm Bangkok .

"(EW.com) -- It's been an interesting year for Charlie Sheen. From getting fired from his gig on ""Two and a Half Men"" to flooding Twitter with non-sensical ramblings (#winning anyone?), and most recently, appearing on the Emmys to wish his old co-stars good luck, he's had his share of ups and downs. And tonight, he got called out for them. Comedians Seth MacFarlane, Jon Lovitz, Jeffrey Ross and Mike Tyson (?), among others, were all on-hand for Sheen's sometimes brutal Comedy Central roast, which aired shortly after his character's mock funeral on Two and a Half Men (poetic timing much?). The comedians took a no-holds barred approach, taking aim at Sheen's history of employing prostitutes and using drugs (read eight of the meanest jokes here). Even Sheen's kids weren't off-limits. ""If you're winning, this must not be a child custody hearing, said Ross. ""The only time your kids get to see you is in reruns -- don't you want to live to see their first 12 steps?"" Sheen laughed and applauded. The comedian also singled out Sheen's ex-wife Brooke Mueller (who was in the audience), in an especially touchy bit alluding to the actor's previous domestic violence charges. ""[Brooke Mueller] is not very bright unless Charlie throws a lamp at her,"" Ross said. He later added, while addressing Tyson, ""There's no denying the fact that Mike Tyson had the hardest hitting right hook in history -- your opponents spent more time bleeding in the corner than Charlie's ex-wives."" For his part, Sheen seemed to take it all in stride and even fired back with some zingers of his own (""I'm done with 'the winning' because I've already won""). Although, it's hard to imagine he didn't feel a single singe while sitting in that hot seat. But how about you? Did the heat from Sheen's roast make you uncomfortable? Or were you enjoying the skewering? Do you think the jokes went too far? Or was it all fair game? Weigh in with your take in the comments below. See the full article at EW.com.

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Washi moved away from the southern Philippines early Monday, but not before leaving behind a wake of destruction and at least 652 people dead, according to the Philippine Red Cross. There were no public storm warnings for the East Asian island nation Monday morning, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. Yet authorities and residents still had the considerable task of cleaning up from the devastation and mourning those killed by what the state-run Philippines News Agency noted was the 19th tropical system to hit the nation this season. A report released Monday morning by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council noted that the storm had affected more than 135,000 people, nearly 47,000 of whom were in evacuation centers. President Beningo Aquino plans to visit the region Tuesday. The Red Cross noted that hundreds are missing after entire villages were swept away, suggesting the death toll could rise further. The stench of death permeated the air as aid workers scrambled to help survivors. The disaster has left heartbreaking scenes of families with children looking for ways to get by during the festive Christmas season. ""Do we still have Christmas, mother?"" one crying little girl asked her mother, according to the Red Cross. ""Will I get my toys and my new pair of shoes you promised?"" ""Of course you will,"" the mother replied. ""Christmas will always be around."" Military and disaster officials said the vast majority of the dead were found in the port cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro, many of them swept away as they were sleeping. Water-logged bodies from washed-away villages floated at the shoreline, on the northwestern coast of Mindanao island. Five people were killed in a landslide, but virtually all the others died in flash flooding after Tropical Storm Washi, which is called Sendong locally. Survivors in the hardest-hit areas are contending with no electricity or clean drinking water. One woman in Cagayan de Oro collected murky brown floodwater in a bucket, just meters away from where a destroyed vehicle was submerged. Flash flooding overnight Friday -- following 10 hours of rain -- fueled the devastation. As much as 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain fell within 24 hours in some areas. December generally brings about 60 millimeters of rain (a little over 2 inches) to the region, CNN Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri reported. Overflowing rivers and tributaries compounded the disaster for low-lying areas, and officials said floodwater reached roof-level in the middle of the night. The destruction left cars, furniture and parts of houses in mangled heaps, partly immersed in squalid floodwater. The storm moved into Cagayan de Oro -- a densely populated, urbanized city -- during the overnight hours when people were asleep. A half dozen vehicles there looked like littered toy trucks, with some on their sides or roofs. Many people trudged through knee-high water and packed into evacuation centers. An estimated 100,000 people are displaced, according to the Department of Social Welfare and Development. The national disaster council noted that about 377 passengers -- on four ships -- were stranded as of Sunday night, due to the storm. In addition, nine sections of roads and bridges were seriously damaged. While the tropical storm had passed off-shore, some unrelated thunderstorms threatened to dump even more water on the region, Javaheri said. The weather was warm, with temperatures of up to about 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit), . Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon will travel to the stricken region Monday to assess the damage, the organization said. ""Certainly this is a very severe humanitarian crisis going on,"" Gordon said Sunday. Authorities have started distributing food rations for some 10,000 families affected by the storm, while also handing out thousands of blankets and mosquito nets, the Red Cross said. The aid agency is appealing for drinking water, food and dry clothes, and officials have asked for volunteers to pack food to send to those who have been displaced. Some Philippine residents called the disaster unprecedented. Benito Ramos, chairman of the national disaster council, said he thinks the event was influenced by climate change and deforestation. Ramos said the storm moved in a westward path to areas rarely hit by major storms or flooding. The most devastated cities -- Cagayan de Oro and Iligan -- became catch basins for water flowing from highlands with denuded forests. Floodwater from Bukidnon province poured down into Cagayan de Oro, while water from Lanao del Sur province gushed into Iligan.

"(CNN) -- Herman Cain claims that brainwashing explains why so few blacks support conservative Republicans such as himself. He is wrong. The thinking, sentiments, and policy preferences he supports give good cause for rejecting him. In his new campaign manifesto, ""This is Herman Cain: My Journey to the White House,"" the candidate states repeatedly and without qualification that ""Our Founding Fathers did their job ... a great job."" He makes no mention of the blacks who fled George Washington, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson during the Revolutionary War in search of their freedom, or the Constitution's protection of slavery, or that the initial Constitution forbade Congress from prohibiting American participation in the international slave trade for 20 years and indeed made that provision unamendable. Cain evinces no recognition of the Founding Fathers' role in erecting a cruel pigmentocracy that continues to poison virtually every aspect of American political, social and cultural life. This is not an abstruse or academic matter. The president nominates federal judges. An important theory of constitutional interpretation vying for ascendancy is originalism: the notion that the Constitution should be read as originally understood by its framers. Justice Clarence Thomas is the most militant originalist on the Supreme Court. A President Cain would seek to fill the federal judiciary with more Clarence Thomases -- a prospect that most blacks rightly view with dread. Asked about his impressions of the Occupy Wall Street dissidents, Cain declared: ""Don't blame the big banks. If you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself "" -- a statement that overlooks the desperation with which millions, a disproportionate number of whom are black, strive to stave off impoverishment and unemployment. Later, when Cain perceived the impolitic character of his comment, he tried to minimize it, asserting that he was only referring to the protesters and not to the impoverished or unemployed in general. That attempt at damage control rings false, however, especially in light of his further comment: ""It is not a person's fault if they succeeded, it is a person's fault if they failed."" Largely located on the lower rungs of the American socioeconomic ladder, most black Americans appreciate sources of opportunity and power that Cain despises: unions, governmental support for the needy, a robust, government-supported full-employment policy, the public provision of health care. His worry, remarkably, is that America is too egalitarian. His signature policy -- the 9-9-9 tax reform proposal -- would institute a regressive consumption tax nationally and starve Social Security and Medicare. It would redistribute income upward. No wonder blacks overwhelmingly repudiate him and his tea party allies. Cain also recently declared: ""I don't believe racism in this country today holds anybody back in a big way."" If there were any doubts before that he was bereft of the knowledge and sensibility required of a significant political figure, much less president, then this egregious statement should remove them. A library full of careful, rigorous studies shows clearly that invidious racial discrimination and, perhaps even more consequentially, the perpetuation of disabilities inflicted by racial mistreatment in the past hurt blacks and other people of color in a broad array of domains: from commercial transactions like buying a car or purchasing a home, to dealing with police, to electoral politics, to wellness and life expectancy. Race still matters. Not only are people of color discriminated against with frequency. Not only are the accumulated burdens of past discrimination permitted to prey upon new generations even in the absence of racial malevolence (complacency is deadly too). But studies also show that the darker you are, the more likely you are to face wrongful indifference or cruel mistreatment. (Take a peek at the illuminating article by Jennifer Hochschild and Vesla Weaver, ""The Skin Color Paradox and the American Racial Order,"" in the December 2007 edition of Social Forces.) Of course, there has been remarkable, positive change in American racial attitudes. But recall the miserable baseline against which we mark that progress. In 1958, the Gallup Organization asked whether Americans would be willing to vote for a qualified black presidential candidate nominated by their own party. Three in five white Americans answered ""no."" The election of Barack Obama is a vivid illustration of the extent to which racial attitudes have evolved. But neither Obama's residency in the White House, nor Herman Cain's current surge, nor the emergence of an African-American affluent class negates the fact that fresh racism and the unhealed wounds of racial injuries inflicted in the past give rise to conditions, observable everywhere, that dishonor the best of American ideals. It is because of Herman Cain's denial of these realities that most blacks will continue, understandably, to view him as unfit for high political office. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Randall Kennedy.","Randall Kennedy: Cain lauds founding fathers, ignoring the fact they protected slavery .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned that Israel must improve its relations with neighboring countries, saying the country is becoming increasingly isolated in the region. Panetta made the comments ahead of his arrival Monday in Israel, where he will meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in an effort to jump start peace talks. ""I don't think there is any question in talking with leaders from Israel that they recognize that they've becoming increasingly isolated in that part of the world, and that's not ... a good situation,"" Panetta told reporters while en route late Sunday to Israel. ""I think they recognize that it's important to do whatever they can to try to improve those relations."" Tensions in the region have been running high in recent weeks over the Palestinian Authority's bid for statehood before the United Nations, and Israel's plans to build 1,100 new homes in disputed territory in south Jerusalem. ""The important thing there is to again reaffirm our strong security relationship with Israel, to make clear that we will protect their qualitative military edge,"" Panetta said. ""As they take risks for peace, we will be able to provide the security that they will need in order to ensure that they can have the room hopefully to negotiate."" Panetta said he plans to offer U.S. help to Israel to improve its deteriorating relationships with some of its neighbors, particularly Turkey and Egypt. ""It's pretty clear, that at this dramatic time in the Middle East when there have been so many changes, that it is not a good situation for Israel to become increasingly isolated. And that's what's happening,"" Panetta said. ""And I think for the security of that region, it's very important that we do everything possible to try to help them re-establish relations with countries like Turkey and with Egypt."" Turkey and Israel have been at odds following the deaths of nine Turkish activists during an Israeli commando raid last year on the SS Mavi Marmara, part of a flotilla of ships that was headed to blockaded Gaza. Last month, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan expelled Israel's ambassador over that nation's refusal to apologize for the incident. Public opposition in Egypt, meanwhile, against its peace treaty with Israel appears to be growing. Protesters last month attacked Israel's embassy. Panetta will follow up his trip to Israel with a stop in Egypt, where he said he will encourage leaders to proceed with a promised election process following the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. The defense secretary said there was little question Israel has maintained its military superiority in the region. ""But the question you have to ask is, is it enough to maintain a military edge if you are isolating yourself diplomatically?,"" Panetta said. ""Real security can only be achieved by both a strong diplomatic effort as well as a strong effort to protect your military strength."" Panetta's visit to the region follows an Israeli announcement Sunday that it supports a call by the Middle East Quartet -- made up of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- . for direct talks with Palestinians to resume within a month. In a statement, the Israeli prime minister's office said Israel ""welcomes the quartet's call for direct negotiations between the parties without preconditions."" ""While Israel has some concerns, it will raise them at the appropriate time,"" the statement added. ""Israel calls on the Palestinian Authority to do the same and to enter into direct negotiations without delay."" Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas has repeatedly said Palestinians would not return to negotiations until Israel halts all settlement construction and accepts 1967 border lines as a basis for the return to talks. Panetta said he will stress to both Palestinians and Israelis that rather than set conditions for negotiating, they look for other approaches to resolve the issues. ""So my main message is, to both sides, you don't lose anything by going into negotiations and trying to pursue a peace process everyone in the world is hopeful can begin,"" he said. Also on the agenda with Israeli leadership is Iran. Panetta said the most effective way to deal with Iran ""is not on a unilateral basis."" Later, Panetta will head to Brussels, Belgium, for a meeting of NATO defense ministers. The coalition has been involved in a number of ongoing military campaigns, including over Libya and in Afghanistan. CNN's Guy Azriel and Michael Schwartz contributed to this report.","The U.S. Secretary of Defense says Israeli isolation is not ""a good situation"" in the Middle East .

"London, England (CNN) -- Don McCullin is best known for the unwavering gaze of his war photography. For thirty years he traveled to places most people run from, depicting horror unflinchingly and with enormous compassion for the people he captured in unimaginable situations. Considered one of the greatest war photographers, McCullin's pictures chart conflicts in Vietnam, Bangladesh, the Congo, El Salvador, Biafra, Cambodia and the Middle East, including the Six-Day War in June 1967. He has, as he puts it, taken ""terrible liberties"" with his life -- dashing through rice paddies in Vietnam to escape snipers' bullets; jumping up to snap a shot during gun battles -- to bring home images that are, at times, excruciating to look at but often unforgettable. And yet, as enduring as these images are, forgetting them is exactly what McCullin now wants to do. ""That war stuff... I don't even want to print it anymore,"" he says. ""I want to put it right out of my mind."" But, along with his photos of poverty, ""that war stuff"" has won McCullin a handful of photography awards and filled tens of books and exhibitions across the world, including his latest, ""Shaped by War,"" which opened Friday at the Imperial War Museum in London. Much of the photography that appears in the exhibition he shot during the 18 years he worked for the UK's Sunday Times Magazine. He went to his first war in Cyprus in 1967 and covered every major conflict of his generation until the Falklands War. The thrill of war . McCullin, now 76, admits that at first he found war ""incredibly exciting."" ""You've got to remember I grew up as a child looking at Hollywood films where no one seemed to die,"" he says. He liked the thrill of making it home alive and seeing his images published even more: ""I felt as if I could levitate and forget gravity as a human being -- I felt really amazing."" How he made it home alive is another matter. As McCullin himself admits: ""You can't learn about survival after a certain point. After that, it's sheer luck really."" But his bravery under fire is well known. Harold Evans, then editor of The Sunday Times wrote of McCullin in The Guardian newspaper many years later: ""Don McCullin has the bottle. This is the man who, amid a fusillade of bullets, would stop to take a light reading."" Shell shock in Vietnam . In 1968, one of McCullin's greatest moments of ""bottle"" produced arguably his most celebrated image: A shell-shocked soldier in Vietnam that he photographed during a huge battle for the ancient city of Hue. The battle raged for two weeks, McCullin remembers. The city was being shelled constantly from navy boats in the Gulf of Tonkin 17 miles away, and phantom bombers were dropping napalm just a few streets from where he was. He said: ""When you saw those napalm tumbling, carrying molten death, you'd say to yourself, 'Keep going. Keep going. Keep going."" And he did, staying with the 5th Marine Regiment for the duration of the battle, during which time, he says, they lost 70 men and 300 wounded. McCullin came away having taken some of the most powerful photographs of his career -- but he was left suffering combat stress, much like the soldier in his photograph. A personal battle . McCullin himself says he was ""completely insane,"" by the end of the battle. When he finally got back to the press center and changed and showered, he realised some remnants of that fight would be harder to get rid of. ""I thought, you know, it (the shower) could cleanse the filth of war off me. It didn't, really, because by then it had all gotten into my brain. ""I was sleeping next to bodies and things (in Hue)... and then you say, 'What the hell's this got to do with photography?' 'Who am I?' 'Where the hell have I just been?' 'What's happened to me?'"" McCullin has spent many years battling the psychological after effects of war, trying to balance the quest for excellence in his work with the horrors he's witnessed. ""It really messes you up,"" he said. ""It's incomprehensible the way human beings can slaughter each other in front of you. And you take it home with you. And it's like you haven't cleaned your teeth in several months, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth."" McCullin's gentle approach . Throughout his career, McCullin has been driven by a search for equality. He puts it down to his background growing up, ill-educated and impoverished, in London's Finsbury Park. That empathy comes through in his gentle approach to the victims he photographed. ""I was very gentle with people. I would come to people that were injured and try to get their consent,"" he says. ""I would not be brash the way I've seen lots of journalists operating... pushing and shoving and having fist fights in front of victims. ""I would seek out the chance to take my photographs and I would look at the person I was photographing and try to convey my disgust to them and I would try to bring them to me in a trusting way."" Landscapes and ruins . Nowadays, McCullin is more content photographing inanimate objects -- like the landscapes around his house in the south of England. He says he shoots his landscapes mainly in winter because he likes the drama of the naked trees, the ""threat"" of winter. ""People say my landscapes look like war scenes because I do (print) them very dark,"" he admits. ""But, you know, I suppose the darkness is in me, really."" Last year, he also published ""Southern Frontiers,"" a book of photographs of Roman ruins in the Middle East and North Africa. It was inspired, he says, by a spur-of-the-moment trip to Algiers many years ago with travel writer Bruce Chatwin. They journeyed around and found themselves, to their surprise, in a Roman town ""with these great slabs of granite as roadways."" He's stored the memory ever since and when he wanted to do one more project and ""totally get away from war"" it fitted. Of course, he says, the irony is that today war would have stopped him from going to some of the places in the book. ""Look at it [the region] now. I couldn't possibly do it today with war in Libya and war in Syria,"" he said. Searching for peace . Mainly, though, McCullin's current quest is for peace of mind. He'll never forget the wars he's witnessed -- ""It took me all my life to try and understand, you know, why do people do this to each other and I still haven't come to any conclusions about it"" -- but they don't haunt him they way they used to. A far cry from the macho war photographer image, McCullin says the thing that gave him the most joy recently was coming home after a holiday and picking some blackberries in the field behind his house. ""I felt real human freedom,"" he said. ""Just having the choice of going and picking those blackberries and ambling home and washing them. ""It's a funny thing to say, but you have to find your own place in the world, eventually. ""I've got a last chapter of my life and I want it to be enjoyable. I don't want to be persecuted by myself anymore, by my guilt anymore -- I've had all that.""","Photographer Don McCullin's exhibition ""Shaped by War"" opened in London Friday .

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- NATO and Russia remained at odds over the alliance's plans for a missile defense system in Europe after a foreign ministers meeting in Brussels Thursday. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said ""differences remain"" over the plans, but he rejected Russia's complaints that NATO was ignoring Moscow's concerns the missile defense system could be used against it. ""We listen and we have listened today,"" Rasmussen said after a meeting of NATO's 28 foreign ministers with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. ""We take Russian concerns seriously."" Rasmussen's tone was softer than his comments Wednesday, when he said Russia's threats to withdraw from the START treaty and deploy ballistic missiles on its southern border to counter the missile shield were reminiscent of a confrontation of a bygone era and reflect a ""fundamental misunderstanding of the West's intentions."" ""We do not consider Russia an enemy,"" he said Thursday after the meeting. ""We consider Russia a partner."" Lavrov said after the talks that NATO was unwilling to compromise . ""Unfortunately our partners are not yet ready for cooperation on missile defense,"" he said, adding the Moscow needed ""clear guarantees"" the missile defense system would not target its own nuclear deterrent. ""We stand ready for dialogue provided that legitimate concerns of all parties are taken into consideration,"" Lavrov said. ""We can find a mutually beneficial solution, we still have some time but time is running out every day."" The Obama administration and its European allies have tried to ease Russia's fears over the project by insisting that the system is directed toward countering the missile threat from the Middle East from which Russia also needs protection. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attempted to make that argument again following the meeting. ""We will continue to press forward on missile defense; we'll be transparent. We have explained that our system cannot and will not threaten Russia, does not affect our strategic balance with Russia,"" she told reporters. ""No other country will be given a veto over what threats we perceive are most salient. Ballistic missiles against the territory we are pledged to protect are not coming from Russia in our assessment but from other locations. It's not directed at Russia, not about Russia; it's Iran and others who are threatening to develop missile technology."" Since NATO approved the U.S.-designed system at last year's summit in Lisbon, Poland, Romania, Spain and Turkey have agreed to deploy parts of it. NATO asked Russia to participate in the system but negotiations have been deadlocked over Russia's demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to Moscow's own systems. Rasmussen said he hoped a political agreement with Moscow could be reached before a summit between NATO and Russia in Chicago next May. That is when NATO is expected to declare an interim operational capability of the system. Last month, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev threatened to withdraw from the START treaty on nuclear weapons reductions and deploy ballistic missiles in its exclave of Kaliningrad on its border with Europe if NATO moved ahead with the plans for missile defense. Tensions increased last week when Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's ambassador to NATO, suggested Moscow would close transit routes that send vital supplies to troops in Afghanistan. More than half the supplies for NATO forces in Afghanistan now arrive from Afghanistan's northern border with Russia and Central Asia. The so-called Northern Distribution Network has become even more important to the war effort in Afghanistan now that Pakistan has shut down its border crossings into Afghanistan following a U.S. air attack killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers late last month. U.S. officials have said that Rogozin has indicated that his remarks were taken ""out of context,"" but he has yet to clarify his remarks. Rasmussen said such threats to close the supply routes were an ""empty threat"" because stabilizing Russia was ""clearly in Russia's self interests."" Moscow ""knows from bitter experience that instability in Afghanistan has negative repercussions in Russia as well,"" he said, referring to the Soviet occupation of the country in the 1990s. Tensions remained high with Russia over comments by Hillary Clinton this week voicing ""serious concerns"" about recent Russia's parliamentary elections and calling for an investigation into allegations of fraud and vote-rigging. Russia's Foreign Ministry described Clinton's comments as ""unacceptable"" and Medvedev said Russia's political system was ""none of their business."" NATO ministers also discussed Afghanistan and plans to gradually transfer security control to Afghan forces before foreign combat troops plan to withdraw by the end of 2014, as well as tensions with Pakistan over last month's attack. The United States has expressed condolences for the attack and is leading an investigation into the incident. Rasmussen on Wednesday expressed regret for the attack and called for renewed cooperation between NATO and Pakistan in Afghanistan. ""I fully agree that at the end of the day we need a positive engagement of Pakistan if we are to ensure long-term peace and stability in Afghanistan,"" he said. The NATO meeting follows Monday's conference in Bonn, Germany, where some 100 nations and international organizations pledged to keep supporting Afghanistan beyond the 2014 withdrawal.","NEW: Clinton says ""it's Iran and others who are threatening to develop missile technology""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Prosecutors will seek the death penalty against a 41-year-old Southern California man charged Friday with murder in this week's mass shooting at a hair salon, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said. Scott Evans Dekraai of Huntington Beach, California, allegedly shot his ex-wife and seven other people to death at the Salon Meritage in the small coastal community of Seal Beach, Rackauckas said Friday. A ninth person was wounded. Prosecutors formally filed eight counts of first-degree murder and a felony count of attempted murder against Dekraai on Friday. The first-degree murder charges carry the special circumstance of multiple murder, the prosecutor said. Dekraai and his ex-wife, Michelle Fournier, 48, were in a custody battle over their 8-year-old son, and the dispute was the motive in the shooting, Rackauckas said. The prosecutor called Dekraai ""a methodical and merciless killer."" On Friday afternoon, Dekraai appeared before Orange County Judge Erick L. Larsh, who, at the request of attorneys, rescheduled Dekraai's arraignment to November 29. Dekraai is not taking his antipsychotic medication, and his attorney asked the court to make the drugs available to Dekraai while he is being held in jail without bail. The judge said he would order a medical team to evaluate Dekraai and, in a response to another defense request, would see if Dekraai's current wife could deliver his spinal cord implant stimulator, which is needed because of a 2007 accident Dekraai experienced. Balding and with a salt-and-pepper goatee, Dekraai appeared calm inside the courtroom's detainee cage. One person in the gallery shouted ""You coward!"" Then, as he exited the courtroom, a sobbing woman uttered ""I hate you! I hate you!"" Dekraai's attorney, Robert Curtis of Long Beach, told the court that he's considering a change of venue. Earlier Friday, authorities held a press conference and recounted how Dekraai's ex-wife, a hair stylist at the salon, was working near the entrance and was among the first two people shot. On the morning of the shooting, which occurred Wednesday, Dekraai and Fournier got into an argument about child custody, authorities said. ""We're sort of guessing. We believe that the custody battle wasn't going well for him. We don't know the contents of their conversation or anything,"" Rackauckas said. Hours later, the gunfire rampage at the salon, just blocks from the ocean, unfolded around 1:20 p.m., authorities said. ""He also considered the people who were friends and who worked with his ex-wife were enablers, and he didn't have much use for them either,"" Rackauckas said. He was armed with three guns -- a 9 mm Springfield, a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum, and a Heckler & Koch .45 -- and was wearing body armor during the shooting rampage, Rackauckas said. He used at least two of those guns, the prosecutor said. Rackauckas summarized the mass shooting, saying Dekraai ""walked through the salon shooting anyone close enough to hit. He stopped to reload during this spree, and he continued gunning people down. He was not satisfied with murdering his intended target, his ex-wife. For almost two minutes, Dekraai shot victim after victim, executing people by shooting them in the head and chest. ""He shot eight people inside the salon. But he was not done. He then walked out of the salon and shot a ninth victim, a male, who was sitting nearby in a parked Range Rover. The reason for this rampage: revenge,"" he said. ""We believe that the defendant committed this unimaginable act of violence because he wanted to kill his ex-wife over a custody dispute concerning their 8-year-old son. He was willing to end any life in his path, and he did. Clearly this two-minute murder spree could not have been about loving his son,"" the prosecutor said. While Dekraai allegedly carried out the mass murder, his son was sitting alone in the principal's office at school, waiting for his mother or father to pick him up, authorities said. ""That little boy is also a victim. He is now left to mourn the murder of his mother and grow up with the knowledge that his father (allegedly) committed a mass murder,"" Rackauckas said. ""What sick, twisted fatherly love is this?"" In addition to Fournier of Los Alamitos, the people killed were salon employee Victoria Ann Buzzo, 54, of Laguna Beach; David Caouette, 64, of Seal Beach, who was in the vehicle outside the salon; salon employee Laura Lee Elody, 46, of Huntington Beach; salon owner Randy Lee Fannin, 62, of Murrieta; salon client Michele Daschbach Fast, 47, of Seal Beach; salon client Lucia Bernice Kondas, 65, of Huntington Beach; and salon employee Christy Lynn Wilson, 47, of Lakewood, authorities said. Dekraai allegedly shot Caouette, who was in the parked vehicle, in the head through a closed front passenger side window, authorities said. The ninth victim, Harriet Stretz, 73, of Los Alamitos is in critical condition. She was at the salon getting her hair done by her daughter, Laura Elody, who was among the victims. ""We do know that the victims were shot multiple times each,"" Rackauckas said. About 20 people were inside the salon during the shooting, and many of them were ""playing dead, hiding in backrooms, trying to get back behind things, just trying to stay out of his way,"" Rackauckas said. Added Seal Beach Acting Police Chief Tim Olson: ""Scott Dekraai is a coward. He armed himself with three handguns and body armor because he didn't want to be shot by police."" Police arrested Dekraai without incident as he was trying to leave the scene in a vehicle two blocks from the salon, police said. Dekraai was in possession of the three guns and ""a significant amount of ammunition in his truck,"" prosecutors said. In the past several months, Fournier complained to Seal Beach police about Dekraai picking up their son from school earlier than the court-ordered mandate, Olson said. That matter was forwarded to family court, and Olson said he didn't know of the complaint's disposition. In 2007, in Long Beach, Dekraai's father-in-law applied for a temporary restraining order, but there was no follow-up, Rackauckas said. An online search of Orange County court records shows the couple filed for divorce in 2007, with activity in the case continuing through this week. A child custody evaluator was appointed by the court in April, records show. Fournier claimed in court papers that Dekraai was mentally unstable, had threatened to kill himself or someone else and ""was almost manic when it comes to demanding absolute right to control our son,"" CNN affiliate KTLA said. The couple was in court the day before the shooting, and a judge had kept custody between them equal, KTLA said. In 1994, Dekraai filed for bankrupcy, according to court records. The Salon Meritage is located on the Pacific Coast Highway in Seal Beach, which residents describe as a small and ""fairly intimate"" coastal town. ""We have multiple years with zero homicides, so this obviously is an unusual and tragic circumstance,"" Seal Beach police Sgt. Steve Bowles said. The shooting is the deadliest in Orange County history, KTLA said. In 1976, Edward Charles Allaway shot nine people, killing seven, at California State University Fullerton. CNN's Traci Tamura, Gabriel Ramirez, Ashley Hayes and Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.","Scott Dekraai's attorney says he is considering a change of venue request .

"(CNN) -- Instead of presents, there might be IOUs under some Christmas trees in Colorado on Sunday.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan must start serving a 30-day jail term next week after admitting that she violated her probation on a necklace theft conviction, a Los Angeles County judge ordered Wednesday. ""It's possible she could be booked in and booked out"" the same day, Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore said Wednesday afternoon. ""It depends on the fluctuations of the day, what's going on in the jail,"" Whitmore said. After that, the actress must work at least 12 days a month at the county morgue until she completes the 53 remaining days on her court-ordered community service and she must attend 18 psychotherapy sessions, Judge Stephanie Sautner told her. If Lohan misses any of those goals, she will be returned to jail for another 270 days, the judge ruled. ""This is what we really call putting the keys to the jail in the defendant's hands,"" Sautner told Lohan. The actress, who admitted violating her probation during a hearing Wednesday, must report to the Los Angeles County jail by November 9, the judge said. ""You are not to get house arrest or early release, except for that required by the law,"" Sautner said. Whitmore said that the early release program is part of the law, meaning Lohan would likely get out quickly due to overcrowding. When Sautner sentenced Lohan to 120 days in jail last May, she ended up serving 35 days of home confinement instead, due to jail overcrowding and state rules that give prisoners credit for good behavior. It was not immediately clear how many days Lohan will actually serve this month, if she ends up getting credit for good behavior. Prosecutors said Lohan missed 12 of 20 scheduled workdays at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, part of the court-ordered community service imposed in May when she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. Lohan, 25, was already on probation for two drunken driving convictions from 2007. She also canceled 14 of 19 scheduled appointments for court-ordered psychotherapy, they said. ""From what I see of you, you need a structure,"" Sautner told Lohan Wednesday, instructing her to return to court each month, starting December 14, to show she is complying with the schedule. If the actress stays on track, her probation would be eased on March 29, 2012, Sautner said. If she doesn't keep up with the requirements, she will serve the additional 270 days behind bars, the judge said. The full sentence imposed Wednesday was 150 days for the necklace theft probation violation and 150 days for violating probation on the 2007 drunk driving conviction in Beverly Hills. While the original sentence included 360 hours of community service at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, the judge said she did not want to put the Skid Row charity through the pain of Lohan again. When the judge called The Good Shepherd Center for Homeless Women, the charity refused to take Lohan on as a worker ""saying you were a bad example,"" Sautner said. But Lohan seemed to find a good fit with her work at the Los Angeles County morgue, where Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said she worked four days in the past two weeks cleaning up. Lohan reports for morgue duty . ""So, the morgue is willing to keep you,"" the judge said. All of her community service work has been transferred there, she said. Two weeks ago, the actress' father, Michael Lohan, told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" program that his daughter shouldn't be in jail, but in rehab. Last week, Michael Lohan was arrested twice in two days for violating a court order to stay away from his former girlfriend. CNN learned Wednesday that he is now in an ""administrative confinement"" cell in the infirmary section of Orient Road jail in Tampa, Florida, where he's awaiting trial. Michael Lohan arrested . Lindsay Lohan's legal woes, which began four years ago with two drunk driving arrests, have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes, and alcohol and drug test failures. Her probation is scheduled to end within a year unless Lohan breaks any laws before then. It has been extended several times because of violations, including the failed alcohol and drug tests.""It's possible she could be booked in and booked out"" the same day."" CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Lohan could be booked in and out the same day, sheriff's spokesman says .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Much of Southeast Asia continued its recovery from heavy rains and extensive flooding Friday, including scores of deaths and extensive damage in Thailand. The wet weather is not entirely abnormal in the region, which is still in the midst of its wet season. Still, the extent of destruction has been particularly devastating in some locales in recent weeks. Thai authorities early Friday said that the flooding had left at least 244 people dead, and some 28 provinces have been affected. More than 820,000 households have been affected in four of the hardest-hit provinces -- Ayutthaya, Lop Buri, Chai Nat and Nakhon -- the state-run MCOT news agency reported, quoting the national disaster prevention and mitigation ministry. An official Thai industrial agency urged factories in Ayutthaya province to shut down through October 11 in order to give it more time to tackle pervasive flooding. The same MCOT report described the situation at the Rojana Industrial Park, in particular, as ""critical."" A government industrial ministry said water will continue to rise over a flood prevention dike, causing issues in the park which has 198 factories that employ 90,000 people. Nationwide, Thai's Labor ministry reported Friday that 1,215 factories in 33 provinces were underwater -- a disaster that affected about 41,000 workers. Almost half of those workers were in Ayutthaya. Moreover, a corrections department official told MCOT that 3,700 inmates in that province had to be evacuated after their prison was submerged under 1.7 meters (6 feet) of water. Filipinos, meanwhile, are trying to regain their footing after being pummeled by successive typhoons in the span of a week. Typhoon Nesat -- known locally as Pedring -- claimed 55 lives, and the death toll from Nalgae -- known locally as Quiel -- rose to four earlier this week. Health and government officials were working fervently to prevent more deaths Friday as they provided medical treatment for people from flood-stricken areas. Health Secretary Enrique Ona said that 54 medical teams from hospitals in and around Manila have gone to evacuation centers in Bulacan and Pampanga to treat the ill, the state-run Philippine News Agency reported. About 3,600 patients in evacuation centers had respiratory diseases, such as the flu and pneumonia, while there were about 600 diarrhea cases, said Ona. In addition, five in Bulacan had leptospirosis, a bacterial disease. Nearby countries were also dealing with the aftermath of severe flooding. That includes Laos, where the top official in Savannakhet province requested ""large amounts of government funding"" in 12 of 15 districts, money that could be used to repair irrigation systems and develop anti-flood systems, according to the state-run KPL news agency. And in Cambodia, Agriculture minister H.E. Chan Saran said that flooding there had affected more than 330,000 hectares (815,000 acres) of rice fields and killed 1,000 working animals in 103 of the nation's 145 districts, the official AKP agency reported Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton offered her nation's ""deepest condolences"" for the families of those who died in Southeast Asia due to the heavy rains and flooding. ""Our embassies in the region are working with local authorities and international organizations to assess how the United States can be of help to countries where the impact of the flooding has been especially devastating,"" Clinton said in a statement. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Flooding in Thailand leaves at least 244 dead and 1,215 factories submerged .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran issued a warning to Israel on Wednesday, with a top military figure saying Iran will ""punish"" any threat. ""The United States is fully aware that a military attack by the Zionist regime on Iran will not only cause tremendous damage to that regime, but it will also inflict serious damage to the U.S.,"" said Gen. Hassan Firouzabadi, commander of the joint chiefs of staff, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. ""We, as the military, take every threat, however distant and improbable, as very real, and are fully prepared to use suitable equipment to punish any kind of mistake,"" he added, according to a CNN translation of his remarks. Another semi-official Iranian news agency, ISNA, published a story in English quoting Firouzabadi as saying, ""The U.S. officials know that Zionist regime's military attack against Iran will inflict heavy damages to the U.S. seriously as well as Zionist regime."" The Israeli Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that Israel ""carried out the test-firing of a rocket propulsion system from the Palmachim military base. This had been planned by the Defense Establishment a long time ago and was carried out as scheduled."" ""This is an impressive technological achievement and an important step in Israel's advances in the realms of missiles and space,"" said Defense Minister Ehud Barak. The comments from Iran and the Israeli missile test come as a very public debate is taking place in Israel about the possibility of a military strike on the Islamic republic. Last week, Israel's largest newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, published a report that suggested Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Barak both supported a strike against Iran's nuclear program. That story was followed up Wednesday by a report in the Israeli daily Haaretz that Netanyahu was lobbying members of his cabinet to support a military strike against Iran despite the various difficulties inherent in such an operation. The paper attributed the information to a senior Israeli official, but did not disclose identity of their source. Israeli and U.S. officials have expressed concerns that Iran is building nuclear weapons, despite Tehran's insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes. The publication of the two reports in the Israeli media brought criticism from cabinet members. ""A public debate about this is nothing less than a scandal. I don't think we've ever had anything like it,"" Dan Meridor, deputy prime minister and intelligence minister, told the Israeli newspaper Maariv. ""The public elected a government to make decisions about things like this in secret. The public's right to know does not include the debate about classified matters like this."" Speaking to Israeli radio, Benny Begin, a minister without portfolio, called the public debate about Iran ""a crazy free-for-all"" and criticized former Israeli intelligence officials for speaking too openly about government deliberations on Iran. The prime minister's office would not comment on the newspaper reports and referred reporters to comments he made about Iran on Monday. ""Regional powers who have control in the Middle East will try to ensure they have greater influence on the new regimes -- influence that will not always support us or be of benefit to us, to say the least,"" Netanyahu said to Israeli legislators during the opening session of the Knesset. ""One of these regional forces is Iran, which continues its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons. A nuclear Iran would pose a dire threat on the Middle East and on the entire world. And of course, it poses a grave, direct threat on us too... We operate and will continue to operate intensely and determinately against those who threaten the security of the state of Israel and its citizens.""

"(CNN) -- Never mind that Susan Orlean took an obscure story of flowers and turned it into the masterful 1998 best-seller ""The Orchid Thief"" (and was then played by Meryl Streep in the movie version, ""Adaptation""). When Orlean told people she was planning to write a biography of Rin Tin Tin, the German shepherd portrayed in movies and on TV, even her friends were puzzled. ""Whaaat?"" many of them said. Sara Nelson talked with Orlean about how and why she spent eight years on the trail of one of the world's most famous canines. Oprah.com: One man, one mission -- rescuing mutts . Q. The book is titled ""Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend"" [Simon & Schuster], but it's really about the several dogs that played him. Much like ""The Orchid Thief,"" it's also about obsession. A: I think I'm often drawn, whether I realize it or not, to the idea of what drives people. What do we love? Orchids have been a source of passion since the beginning of time. Rin Tin Tin has been beloved and admired and dreamed about for nearly a hundred years. The dog and the orchids are both things that very disparate and sometimes unlikely people come together over. Oprah.com: 33 fall must-reads . Q. One of the fascinating things about the book is the way it goes off on tangents -- about Nazi Germany, the 1950s, your own family history -- but still somehow stays on the story of ""Rinty."" Why did you construct the book this way? A: I think writing a book is very much a performance. I'm conscious of how readers will feel following a story when they might have started out thinking, I can't believe I'm reading a book about a TV dog. Where I hope you end up is: Oh wow, this is an amazing story and I never thought about the culture this way. Or I didn't know dogs had weddings in the late 1800s. I just hope that people will get excited about learning all these things the way I did when I was writing. Q. What's the biggest misconception people have about Rin Tin Tin? A: Either that there was only one dog -- who miraculously lived for 80 or so years, I guess! -- or the exact opposite: that there was no real dog, just a character. Oprah.com: Middle-school girls give stray dogs a second chance . Q. Were you surprised by how emotionally attached you got to the story? A: What has always fascinated me and what's very emotional to me is the question of what lasts. People want to, if not live forever, have evidence of their existence live forever. And I think that part of what happened for me was that my dad died in the course of my writing this, and I started thinking about memory, the idea that things come and go and then they're gone and forgotten. But Rin Tin Tin, by being reinvented over and over in people's imaginations, became kind of a timeless model: He just keeps going and going; his story outlives everybody. I feel great tenderness toward the people who devoted themselves to Rin Tin Tin and his history because I think everybody wants to have had their existence noted by the universe. Oprah.com: 5 books everyone should read at least once . Q. Okay, in the great ""Stones or Beatles?"" tradition, tell us: Are you a Rinty person or a Lassie person? A: I think you can love both dogs, even if you have an allegiance to one. I have no statistics to back this up, but my guess is that Rin Tin Tin had more boy fans and Lassie more girl fans; after all, Lassie was female, supposedly, and the setting of her story was more domestic, including a mother, whereas Rin Tin Tin was definitely male, living in an all-male world. Maybe they represented opposite ends of a spectrum -- Lassie was about love and nurture, Rin Tin Tin about loyalty and bravery. My dirty secret is that I did truly love Lassie -- but I feel I'm being unfaithful to Rin Tin Tin by confessing that. Oprah.com: 16 great books for dog lovers .

"(CNN) -- Croatians voted Sunday in support of their country's bid to join the European Union, paving the way for the southern European nation to become the alliance's 28th member. According to official results, posted on a government website, about 66% of voters backed Croatia's entry into the EU and 33% sided against the move. Turnout was about 44%. Already a member of NATO, Croatia is now poised to join an EU bloc that includes its neighbors Slovenia and Hungary. It is one of five nations listed as ""candidate countries"" on the European Union's website. Last December, Croatian leaders signed an accession treaty paving the way for the nation's entry. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called that signing ""an outstanding moment for the European Union -- and for Croatia."" ""Today, we all acknowledge the hard work Croatia has done and its crowning success,"" Barroso said in a December 9 statement. ""Croatia is the best proof of how strong and successful the transformative power of our enlargement policy can be."" Years after initiating its bid, Croatia is on pace to ""rightly join our union"" on July 1, 2013, the European Commission president said. In that statement, Barroso alluded to the economic crisis affecting much of the eurozone, including bailouts of Greece, Ireland and Portugal. But he insisted that these issues should not halt the European Union's expansion. ""Enlargement, provided that all the relevant conditions are met, will ... continue to serve as an anchor of stability, a driver of democracy and the rule of law,"" he said.

"New York (CNN) -- Police arrested hundreds of protesters who occupied an iconic New York bridge during demonstrations against the nation's financial system, before releasing the demonstrators with tickets. The ""Occupy Wall Street"" protesters extended their rally to Brooklyn Bridge, where they were cited for blocking the roadway, authorities said late Saturday. Protesters banged drums and chanted, ""the whole world is watching"" as police moved in. ""Over 700 summonses and desk appearance tickets have been issued in connection with the demonstration on the Brooklyn Bridge ... after multiple warnings by police were given to protesters to stay on the pedestrian walkway,"" said Paul J. Browne, deputy commissioner for the New York City Police Department. Browne said authorities had warned protesters they would be arrested if they occupied the roadway. ""Some complied and took the walkway without being arrested,"" he said. Bridge traffic heading to Brooklyn from Manhattan was shut down for several hours, police said. Manhattan-bound lanes were open during the incident. The protesters are rallying against what they say are social inequities resulting from the financial system. Organizers have said they take their inspiration from the Arab Spring protests that swept through Africa and the Middle East this year. Crowds have taken up residence in the park in New York's financial district, calling for 20,000 people to flood the area for a ""few months.""

"(CNN) -- Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno said Sunday the string of sexual child abuse charges against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky are ""shocking."" Sandusky, 67, allegedly engaged in fondling, oral and anal sex with young boys over a period of more than 10 years, according to an investigative state grand jury's summary of testimony. He maintains he is innocent. Also named in the state grand jury report are Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley, 57, and Gary Schultz, 62, the university's senior vice president for finance and business. They face one count of perjury each in connection to an alleged cover-up of the abuse. ""If true, the nature and amount of charges made are very shocking to me and all Penn Staters. While I did what I was supposed to with the one charge brought to my attention, like anyone else involved I can't help but be deeply saddened these matters are alleged to have occurred,"" Paterno said in a statement. The legendary coach said an assistant coach told him in 2002 about an ""incident in the shower of our locker room facility."" ""It was obvious that the witness was distraught over what he saw, but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the Grand Jury report. Regardless, it was clear that the witness saw something inappropriate involving Mr. Sandusky. As Coach Sandusky was retired from our coaching staff at that time, I referred the matter to university administrators,"" Paterno said. Sandusky, who served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions, faces seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and numerous other charges, including aggravated indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child. In some cases, Sandusky promised boys gifts or invited them to football games and sleepovers, according to the grand jury. ""One of the most compelling and disturbing pieces of testimony in this investigation came from an eyewitness to a late-night sexual assault that allegedly occurred in March of 2002, in the locker room of the Lasch Football Building on the University Park Campus,"" Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said Saturday. ""Hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty, a graduate assistant reportedly observed Sandusky sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old,"" she said. The assistant reported the incident to head football coach Paterno, who in turn alerted athletic director Curley, said Kelly. Instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Curley and Schultz banned Sandusky from having children from Second Mile visit the football building, Kelly said. Sandusky, who retired from coaching in 1999, was founder of the Second Mile, a charitable organization that began as a group foster home ""dedicated to helping troubled boys,"" the grand jury states. He was arrested and released Saturday on $100,000 unsecured bail. ""If this is true we were all fooled, along with scores of professionals trained in such things, and we grieve for the victims and their families. They are in our prayers,"" Paterno said in his statement. He added: ""I understand that people are upset and angry, but let's be fair and let the legal process unfold. In the meantime I would ask all Penn Staters to continue to trust in what that name represents, continue to pursue their lives every day with high ideals and not let these events shake their beliefs nor who they are.""","Paterno: ""If this is true we were all fooled""
