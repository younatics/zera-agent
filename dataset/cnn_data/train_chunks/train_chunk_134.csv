"(CNN) -- Thousands of people were evacuated from the coast of southern Spain on Friday as a wildfire menaced the wealthy resort town of Marbella, local authorities said. About 4,000 people were evacuated from the village of Ojen and an additional 2,000 people from the eastern part of Marbella, said Maria Jose Figueira, a spokeswoman for Marbella's government. The fire has been brought under control in Marbella but continues to rage out of control north of Marbella near Ojen and Coin, Figueira said. At least one person is feared dead after a charred body, thought to be that of an elderly man, was found in Ojen, she told CNN. An injured German couple has been admitted to the Carlos Haya Hospital in Malaga, she added. The wildfire started Thursday in Coin, to the north of Marbella, Figueira said. It was at its most intense at noon Friday near the villages of Ojen, Coin and Monda, Spain's Efe news agency reported. A racetrack in Marbella and a sports center in the Monda area have been set up as shelters for those forced to leave their homes, the news agency said. However, those previously ordered to leave their homes in Marbella can now return, Figueira said. The Costa del Sol, in Spain's Andalucia region, is popular with visitors for its Mediterranean beaches and sunshine, and is home to large numbers of expatriates, particularly from Britain. The UK Foreign Office said it was working with Spanish authorities. ""We estimate that several hundred British nationals have been evacuated, including some 300 who have been relocated to evacuation centers in the La Cala de Mijas and Calahonda areas,"" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. Marbella, studded with luxurious villas, is known as a destination for the rich and famous. Monda and Ojen lie in the foothills of the Sierra de las Nieves, a mountainous area designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1995, according to the Costa del Sol Tourist Board.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer remained on course to complete a career golden grand slam after brushing aside John Isner of the United States in the quarterfinals Thursday. Federer, desperate to add Olympic singles gold to his 17 grand slam titles, struggled to cope with the giant Isner's service but still emerged as a 6-4 7-6 winner on Centre Court. A break in the 10th game of the first set gave the Swiss maestro the early advantage, but he was pushed all the way in the second. It went to a tiebreak where a fortuitous net cord for Federer gave the 17-time grand slam champion his passage to the last four. He will now face Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina after the former U.S. Open champion beat Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-4 7-6. Only Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal have achieved the feat of claiming a full set of grand slam titles and backed it it with Olympic gold in the singles. Federer beat Britain's Andy Murray to win the Wimbledon crown last month and return to top spot in the world rankings. They could be set to meet again after Murray kept home hopes alive with a 6-4 6-1 dismissal of Spain's Nicolas Almagro in their quarterfinal clash. The Scot, roared on by a partisan home crowd on Centre Court, was never seriously troubled but will have to get past Serbia's Novak Djokovic to get his chance of golden revenge. Djokovic, who has never lost to Murray in a grand slam, brushed aside Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 6-1 7-5 to earn his last four place as he bids for a first Olympic singles gold.","Roger Federer remains on course for career golden slam .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Manhattan jury awarded $2.33 million to a man who lost his leg after drunkenly stumbling onto the path of an oncoming subway train. Dustin Dibble fell on New York subway tracks, was hit by a train and had his leg severed in 2006. Dustin Dibble, 25, landed in the subway tracks after a late night watching a hockey game at a bar with friends April 23, 2006. A downtown N train ran over him, severing his right leg. According to Dibble's lawyer, Andrew Smiley, NYC Transit rather than Dibble bore primary responsibility for the accident because the subway driver had time to stop the train but did not. Smiley added that Dibble's drunkenness did not excuse the driver, who said in a court deposition that he mistook Dibble for an inert object. ""They don't get a free pass as to why the person was on the tracks. They are trained to be able to look out for people on the tracks ... and people are known to be intoxicated by night,"" the lawyer said. Dibble's blood-alcohol level at the time of the accident was .18, according to his lawyer, more than twice the legal limit had he been behind the wheel of a car. The jury ruled Tuesday that Dibble was 35 percent responsible for the accident, so his monetary compensation was also reduced by 35 percent -- from $3,594,943 to $2,336,713. The deficit-plagued MTA plans to appeal the decision, according to spokesman James Anyansi.","Dustin Dibble, 25, fell on tracks after watching a hockey game at a bar .

"(CNN) -- ""Shh ... shh get back,"" the man with the walkie-talkie said. ""We're filming."" Contadora, one of Panama's Pearl Islands, draws visitors with beautiful beaches and excellent snorkeling. We had stumbled onto the set of a ""Survivor""-like television show. But I'm getting ahead of myself. First let me tell you how we stumbled onto the Pearl Islands in Panama, and then I'll tell you how we came upon the Orange Tribe on the island of Mogo Mogo. Every year, my husband and I take my niece on a summer vacation. This year, we decided to go to Panama. Besides the canal, Panama has a lot to offer: There are mountains, beaches, colonial cities and rain forests. After we found a $158 round trip flight from Miami, Florida, the decision was made. My only fear was the weather; it was rainy season in Central America. After weeks of research, I was torn. We had enough time to visit one set of islands, and there were two island chains that I was having a hard time choosing between. The San Blas Islands are off the northeast coast of Panama in the Caribbean. They're also known as Kuna Yala and are home to the Kuna Indians. It would be a chance to see the Kunas up close, living as they have for centuries in grass huts along the water's edge. The other option was the Pearl Islands. The Archipiélago de las Perlas, less well-known than the San Blas, is off the southern Pacific coast of Panama. After an agonizing week of self-debate, I decided that our summer vacation would include a trip to the Pearl Islands. The flight was only 20 minutes from Panama City, but more importantly, I was told it didn't rain as much on the Pacific side. The sales pitch to my niece: ""We are going to where the 2003 edition of 'Survivor' and 'Survivor: All-Stars' were filmed."" I was referring to the popular American reality TV show, and I didn't realize that dozens of other countries had their own versions. I admit my destination choice was not as educational as a few days with the Kuna Indians, but I thought it would be better than being rained in with a bored teenager. After a short flight from Panama City in a puddle jumper, we were on the island of Contadora, one of hundreds that make up the Pearl Islands and one of three that can be reached by commercial flight. It's a tiny island with a handful of places to stay and even fewer places to get a meal. Golf carts, the primary mode of transportation, can be rented upon arrival. All of Contadora's entertainment is provided by the sea. It's a beach bum's paradise. If you are a beach bum and a reality TV fan, you can sit on the sand and watch props being built for the contestants' challenges. It's probably the best set shop in the world, or at least the one with the nicest view. But the Pearl Islands offer more than just an exotic TV set. For $30 an hour, you can go snorkeling and island hopping in a small but comfortable wooden fishing boat. We found Niño, our boat captain and guide, on Playa Larga, the beach in front of the Contadora Beach Resort. We did some of the best snorkeling I've ever done anywhere in the world. After a morning of fantastic snorkeling, I asked Niño where ""Survivor"" was filmed. ""Close by. I will take you there,"" he said. Niño took us to Mogo Mogo, one of many uninhabited islands just off the shore of Contadora. As the island's white sandy beaches came into sight, we noticed a clearing where people were putting finishing touches on what looked like a game for contestants. Our boat captain told us it was for ""Desafío"" (""Challenge""), a Colombian version of the popular reality show. The word on Contadora was that a few countries (Bulgaria, Serbia and Israel, to name a few) were either finishing filming ""Survivor""-type shows or starting new seasons. A representative for the Panamanian Institute of Tourism told me the government had limited information on the filming and could not confirm the word on the street. We jumped out of the boat, waded through the clear, warm blue water and onto Mogo Mogo, unacknowledged as work continued on the wooden set. Noticing a well-worn path, we decided to check out the rest of the island. We thought we were alone when we reached the beach on the other side. But as we walked down what we thought was a deserted beach, we spotted an orange flag in the sand. We knew the American ""Survivor"" was filmed on this island, but we did not expect to be standing in front of contestants in orange buffs, sitting on a log in the shade. This is when the man with the walkie-talkie shushed us because they were filming. The locals talk about the shows and the many countries they hail from, but they don't seem to capitalize on the ""Survivor"" fame. Contadora locals certainly make money off the film staff, medics and contestants, but evidently they haven't printed the T-shirts yet. The only shirts we saw were on the backs of others that identified them as ""Survivor Crew."" Perhaps a true fan could purchase a shirt directly off someone's back. The island is only so big, and you are bound to run into a crew from some country. One night, we were the only non-reality show customers in Gerald's restaurant, a popular place for beer and pizza. After our innocent but failed attempt at a guest appearance on ""Desafío,"" we returned to the basic comforts on Contadora. That night, as we relaxed in a restaurant -- cold drinks in hand, a warm hearty meal just ordered -- darkness fell. The rain, as it often does in the tropics, started coming down in sheets. I leaned back and thought to myself, ""If I was a contestant, tonight I would vote myself off of Mogo Mogo.""","""Survivor"" and similar shows have been filmed on Panama's Pearl Islands .

"London (CNN) -- Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" has been named the greatest movie of all time, knocking long-time favorite Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" off the top of a once-in-a-decade survey of critics from around the world. Hitchcock's thriller, starring James Stewart and Kim Novak, came top of Sight & Sound magazine's poll of 846 film experts more than 50 years after the movie was first released -- to little critical acclaim -- in 1958. Sight & Sound has compiled a list of the 100 greatest films every 10 years; the results, announced with great fanfare, are awaited with bated breath by cinephiles across the globe. But over the decades the composition of the top 10 has remained relatively consistent, with ""Citizen Kane"" retaining pole position for half a century. This time around, though, Orson Welles' 1941 masterwork slipped to the number two slot, ahead of Yasujiro Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" (1953) at number three, Jean Renoir's ""La Regle du Jeu"" at number four. Sight & Sound's editor Nick James said the surprise result in the critics' poll reflected changes in the culture of film criticism, away from ""films that strive to be great art, such as 'Citizen Kane,' and that use cinema's entire arsenal of effects to make a grand statement"" towards those with ""personal meaning to the critic."" ""Vertigo is the ultimate critics' film because it is a dreamlike film about people who are not sure who they are but who are busy reconstructing themselves and each other to fit a kind of cinema ideal of the ideal soul mate,"" he said in a statement. F.W. Murnau's ""Sunrise"" (1927) rounded out the top five. Murnau's first Hollywood movie was one of a record three silent films to make it into the top ten, alongside Dziga Vertov's ""Man with a Movie Camera"" (1929) and Carl Theodor Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" (1928). And while the rest of the top ten does include films familiar to more mainstream moviegoers -- Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and John Ford's ""The Searchers"" -- there is little room in the poll for today's box office hits. Hollywood's big-budget blockbusters, such as ""Avatar,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""The Avengers"" do not register in the upper reaches of the poll. You'll find no Harry Potter or James Bond -- the most successful film franchises of all time -- and you'll have to look beyond the top 20 for a film made beyond the 20th century. ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" dating from 1968, is the most modern film in the top 10; more recent offerings from Wong Kar-Wai -- 2000's ""In the Mood for Love"" -- and David Lynch -- 2001's ""Mulholland Drive"" make their debuts lower down the list, at 24 and 28, respectively. Women, too, are poorly represented -- just two female filmmakers are included in the top 100 -- Chantal Akerman for ""Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles"" (at 35) and Claire Denis for ""Beau Travail"" (at 78). Filmmakers also got to have their say: A separate poll of 358 directors from all over the world, including Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen and Quentin Tarantino, picked ""Tokyo Story"" as their top movie, ahead of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in joint second place. ""Vertigo"" was placed seventh on the directors' list. And there's hope for the likes of James Cameron, Christopher Nolan and Peter Jackson -- Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" was not considered ""great"" at the time of its release. Its gradual rise up the Sight & Sound poll (it was first included in 1982, at number 7) parallels an increasing recognition of Hitchcock's film-making prowess.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The grandson of the creator of Red Bull energy drink allegedly crashed his Ferrari into a Thai police officer, killing him, and then fled the scene, Bangkok police said Monday. The controversy over the arrest of Vorayud Yoovidhaya, 27, who is a prominent member of one of Thailand's richest families, resulted in the suspension of a police officer accused of having another person pretend to have been driving Yoovidhaya's car. Police Sgt. Major Wichien Klanprasert was responding to a robbery call when his motorcycle was hit by what a witness described as a black sports car at 5 a.m., according to Bangkok Police Maj. Gen. Parinya Jansuriya. Investigators followed the path of leaked oil from the crash scene to Yoovidhaya's home, Jansuriya said. Dozens of police surrounded the mansion before entering with a search warrant, where they found a badly damaged black Ferrari. The front was wrecked and its air bags deployed, Jansuriya said. Yoovidhaya was taken to a police station for questioning and the car was seized by investigators, he said. Yoovidhaya admitted driving the car and hitting the motorcycle, but he claimed he was suddenly cut off by the bike, according to Police Maj. Gen. Aunuchi Lekbumrung. He has been charged with causing a death with negligence and hit and run, he said. Yoovidhaya was quickly released on a bond of 500,000 baht, about $16,000. The man who had claimed to be driving was fined 6,000 baht, about $200, the Police Chief Kumronvit Thoopkrachang said. Vorayud Yoovidhaya's grandfather, Chaleo Yoovidhaya, teamed with an Austrian businessman to create the Red Bull brand and products based on a Thai drink. His father, Chalerm Yoovidhaya, is an executive with the energy drink company.","Vorayud Yoovidhaya, 27, is a prominent member of one of Thailand's richest families .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Sylvester Stallone appealed Monday for an end to ""speculation and questionable reporting"" about his son's death, while police and the coroner investigate what killed Sage Stallone last week. Sage Stallone, 36, was found dead in his Los Angeles home Friday by his housekeeper, who was asked by Stallone's mother to check on him after his lawyer and friend, George Braunstein, was unable to reach him, Braunstein told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Monday. Sylvester Stallone, in a statement to CNN Monday, referred to celebrity news websites' speculation about his son using drugs. ""This is in reference to the speculation and questionable reporting surrounding the death of my son Sage,"" Stallone said. ""Because when a parent loses a child there is no greater pain. Therefore I am imploring people to respect my wonderfully talented son's memory and feel compassion for his loving mother Sasha, because this agonizing loss will be felt for the rest of our lives. Sage was our first child and the center of our universe and I am humbly begging for all to have my son's memory and soul left in peace."" The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, which completed the autopsy Sunday, declined to release any preliminary findings at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department, which is conducting its own investigation, a coroner's spokesman said Monday. It could take six weeks for toxicology tests, which would show if drug use was involved, to be completed by the coroner's lab, the spokesman said. While the coroner is in charge of the death investigation, detectives from the LAPD Robbery-Homicide Division also routinely get involved in high-profile deaths, a police spokesman said. Sage Stallone was not known for going out to clubs and partying, Braunstein said. His vices were candy bars and soda, he said. Sudden celebrity deaths often draw early speculation about drug involvement in Hollywood, but in several recent cases the cause of death proved to be natural. Although the investigation into actor Corey Haim's death two years ago began as a ""suspected prescription medication overdose,"" toxicology tests ""revealed no significant contributing factors"" from drugs, the coroner later concluded. Pneumonia, not drug abuse, killed Haim. Similar speculation about drug use followed the December 2009 death of actress Brittany Murphy. The coroner eventually ruled that Murphy died from a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication. The drugs involved are legal and are used to treat respiratory infections, according to the autopsy report. Coroner: What killed Sage Stallone is still unknown .

"(CNN) -- Basketball, track and swimming have been staples at the Olympics for decades, drawing thousands of spectators. But solo synchronized swimming or live pigeon shooting? They are among the strangest events that have, at one time or another, taken place at the Games. What to watch for at the Olympics this year . Here are the 10 oddest sports that have graced the modern Olympics -- some will feature at London 2012 over the coming weeks, some thankfully will not... SOLO SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING . Oxymoron alert! Yes, this sport features one female swimmer synchronizing with herself. The sport made its debut in the Los Angeles Games in 1984, with U.S. swimmer Tracie Ruiz winning the gold medal. Similar to the group event, a swimmer performs a kind of water ballet. A lonely water ballet. Despite the seemingly misleading title, organizers of the sport say the swimmer is actually in sync with the music. Will we see this sport in London? No. But there will be the team synchronized swimming events that most people are familiar with. The solo event was discontinued after 1992. CLUB SWINGING . Club Swinging debuted in 1904. The athlete stands erect, holding clubs that resemble bowling pins in each hand. He then twirls and whirls them around. The more complicated the routine, the more points he wins. Historians say the sport was the precursor to rhythmic gymnastic events that use ribbons and hoops. Will we see this sport in London? No. Sadly. Club Swinging was only in the Olympics twice, ending in 1932. TUG-OF-WAR . Once a very competitive Olympic sport, tug of war employs teams that struggle and strain to pull a rope past a certain point. Great Britain actually won the most medals in this event, historians say. Will we see this sport in London? Nope. Tug-of-war was an Olympic event until 1920, and was then relegated to the church picnic circuit. LIVE PIGEON SHOOTING . The 1900 Olympics in Paris had the great distinction of being the first Games where women competed. It also wore the ignoble badge for this sport, where athletes aimed to bring down as many pigeons as possible. Nearly 300 birds were slain, historians say, leaving a bloody, feathery mess. The winner shot down 21 pigeons. Will we see this sport in London? Yes. Just kidding. Come on now. The 1900 Games in Paris was the only time pigeon killing was featured in the Olympics. 4 billions reasons to watch the Olympics . SWIMMING OBSTACLE COURSE . As strange as this sport may seem, the obstacles swimmers had to overcome are even more unusual. In the 1900 Games in Paris, swimmers crawled over boats, swam under them and climbed a pole -- all the while swimming 200 meters in the Seine. Will we see this sport in London? No. The boats on the Thames are safe. ROLLER HOCKEY . Maybe if this was the 1970s and there was a disco ball, this sport would have taken off. Roller Hockey debuted at the 1992 Barcelona Games. The game follows the rules of ice hockey, but with roller skates. Argentina took the gold. Will we see this sport in London? No. The Barcelona Games was the only time Roller Hockey was in the Olympics. LA CANNE . Ok, think fencing. Now take away the saber and replace it with a cane. You know, the walking stick type of thing? Voila, now you have the French martial art La Canne, that debuted at the 1924 Olympics. Will we see this sport in London? No, but you can watch the fencing events and image how much more awesome it would be with wooden canes. ROPE CLIMBING . Yes, the activity that made you feel like a weakling in your physical education class debuted as an Olympic sport in 1896. Just like in your gym class, climbers are timed to see how quickly they can shimmy up a braided rope. But unlike your classmates, these athletes didn't run out of steam before reaching the top. Will we see this sport in London? No. After 1932, the Olympics thankfully left rope climbing behind. Kind of like you did after high school. TRAMPOLINE . Despite seeming like an activity you did in your backyard when you were 10, trampoline debuted as an Olympic sport in 2000. Gymnasts take to the trampoline, somersaulting and flipping as stern-faced judges keep score. ""Precise technique and perfect body control are vital for success, with judges delivering marks for difficulty, execution and time of flight, minus penalties,"" Olympic officials say. Will we see this sport in London? Yes. Both men and women trampolinists (yes, that is a word) will compete in London. RACE WALKING . In this sport, competitors try to outrace one another -- without actually running. Huh? Even though the premise seems a little goofy, race walking has actually been an Olympic sport since 1904. To ensure that athletes do not run, race walkers must have one foot on the ground at all times or risk disqualification. The result? A distinctive sashay that elicits many a giggle. Will we see this sport in London? Yes. Men will compete in 20-kilometer and 50-kilometer races; women in 20 kilometers. Ready, set, sashay! Olympic mascots: Cute or creepy?","The Olympic Games has a history of sports that featured only briefly in the program .

"(CNN) -- Officials believe the ""main battle"" is about to begin in the Syrian city of Aleppo, the U.N. peacekeeping chief said Thursday. ""The focus is now on Aleppo, where there has been a considerable buildup of military means, and where we have reason to believe that the main battle is about to start,"" said Herve Ladsous, the United Nations under-secretary-general for peacekeeping operations. Ladsous spoke to reporters and briefed the U.N. Security Council Thursday, hours after Syrian rebels battered a military base near Aleppo as the battle for the nation's most populous city raged. Rebels used tanks seized in previous clashes with government troops to pound the Menagh military airport, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The base is north of Aleppo, Syria's commercial capital. The main military airfield in the region is southeast of the city. The government-run Syrian Arab News Agency said authorities were ""killing or wounding dozens of terrorists"" in the countryside outside Aleppo. Regime warplanes shelled the western and northern parts of the city, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Communication was spotty inside the besieged city. Cellular phone service was cut off, and power outages were reported in neighborhoods where there was heavy shelling, according to Deama, an activist there who asked that her full name not be used for her protection. Thursday's fighting comes amid unsuccessful international diplomacy. Kofi Annan, who championed a six-point peace plan this year, said he has resigned as the U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria. While diplomats debate how to handle the situation, there has been stepped-up help for the emboldened rebel forces, dominated by military defectors who have streamed into the opposition's arms for months. Obama authorized covert support for Syrian rebels, sources say . Rebels are now equipped with heavy weaponry, including tanks, the United Nations said, a sign that the armed resistance to President Bashar al-Assad's regime is gaining military potency. Government forces also used heavy weapons in the clashes. MiG-23 fighter jets struck rebels in an Aleppo village, said Capt. Ammar Al-Wawi of the Free Syrian Army. Syrian state TV said soldiers ""have been able to eliminate scores of terrorists and mercenaries"" in Aleppo and claim to be sweeping through the city's Salaheddine neighborhood and towns west of Aleppo. Shelling and clashes have raged across the city for days, prompting thousands to flee their homes. Both rebels and government forces are placing great importance on gaining control of the metropolis. But Aleppo was not the only hot spot in Thursday's fighting. Anti-al-Assad fighters and government forces continued clashing across Syria. At least 130 people were killed throughout the country Thursday, including 50 in Damascus and its suburbs and seven in Aleppo province, the LCC said. The opposition activist network blamed government troops for an attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Damascus that killed 15 people. More than 50 others were wounded due to heavy shelling in the area, the LCC said. Syrian state television said terrorists were behind the attack, adding that authorities were searching for those responsible. In an online video purporting to show the camp after the shelling, men ran past charred, bloodied bodies on the street. In the background, a woman screamed. Another video purportedly showing the camp later Thursday night showed protesters chanting ""the people want to bring down the regime."" CNN cannot independently confirm reports of violence in Syria because the government has limited access by international journalists. Syria's uprising: From rocks to RPGs . The fighting has devastated the Syrian economy and left many people in dire straits. As many as 3 million Syrians will need food in the next 12 months as farmers in the conflict-ravaged nation lose assets and livestock, the United Nations said in a report Thursday. The Syrian agricultural sector has suffered $1.8 billion in losses this year, including crops, livestock and irrigation systems, according to the report. ""While the economic implications of these losses are quite grave, the humanitarian implications are far more pressing,"" said Muhannad Hadi, the World Food Programme representative in Syria. The Syrian crisis started when al-Assad's security forces launched a violent crackdown on peaceful protests in March 2011. That clampdown spurred a nationwide uprising as armed rebels, including military defectors and other fighters, battled under the Free Syrian Army. The conflict has claimed roughly 17,000 lives, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week. Opposition activists put the toll at more than 20,000. A key question remains: whether United Nations observers will remain in Syria. The group's mandate is set to expire on August 19. The 150 military observers and 80 civilians remaining in Syria conducted more than 50 patrols over the past few weeks, according to Ladsous, the United Nations' peacekeeping chief. ""They report, they inform us. And they try -- wherever it's possible -- to mediate, to arrange local ceasefires, humanitarian pauses to allow civilian populations to withdraw from shelling areas,"" he said. Meanwhile, U.N. Security Council President Gerard Araud suggested that the council should consider shifting its attentions toward humanitarian problems in Syria. ""The divisions in the council are very deep. I think its irreconcilable in political terms,"" he said. ""Maybe we should work on (the) humanitarian situation, which is becoming disastrous. At least the Security Council would be useful,"" Araud added. On Wednesday, U.S. officials said President Barack Obama had signed a covert directive authorizing U.S. support for Syrian rebels. The secret order, referred to as an intelligence ""finding,"" allows for clandestine support by the CIA and other agencies. Syrian state TV said Obama signed ""secret documents"" to ""support terrorists."" The Obama administration had said it would step up its assistance to the opposition after last month's failure by the U.N. Security Council to agree on tougher sanctions against the al-Assad regime, but exactly what type of support the finding authorizes was unclear. The Obama administration has ruled out arming the rebels for now, providing only nonlethal assistance, such as communications equipment. Complete coverage on the unrest in Syria .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A high school marching band played at Clark Atlanta University's football game Saturday night after the university's band was suspended over possible hazing, officials said. The Benjamin E. Mays High School band played during the halftime show at Clark Atlanta's home game against the University of West Alabama, said William Earvin, the high school's band director and conductor. Clark Atlanta announced Friday that its Mighty Marching Panthers band would be temporarily suspended because of hazing allegations. It said there is no immediate evidence of hazing or other foul play, but it is investigating. ""Even the possibility of hazing is unacceptable under any circumstance,"" the university said in a statement. ""Ideally, the allegations will prove untrue and the band can return to its planned schedule of performances as quickly as possible,"" the school said. ""However, regardless of the findings, Clark Atlanta is prepared to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure a safe, healthy, nonthreatening experience for our student musicians."" The allegations at Clark Atlanta follow the hazing scandal at Florida A&M University that began with the death of drum major Robert Champion, 26, last November. FAMU's band director retired in the wake of the scandal and the school's president resigned.

"(Wired) -- Twitter launched a new service on Wednesday called the Twitter Political Index, or Twindex. By applying highly tuned algorithms to Twitter's fire hose of data, the service offers a real-time look at voters' moods, and scores which presidential candidate is trending up (and who is trending down) day to day. Twindex is a joint effort between Twitter, Topsy, and two polling groups, the left-leaning Mellman Group and the more conservative NorthStar Opinion Research. The collective goal is to dive into Twitter's deep trove of data, and pull up insights faster than Gallup and other traditional polling companies. Expect to see Twindex results referenced in all political news and commentary as we head into the presidential election. Welcome to the age of big political data. In 2008, Twitter co-founder Ev Williams walked into the then-tiny Twitter office's very small conference room, and saw something remarkable: a way for Twitter to track what people were saying about the upcoming presidential election in real-time. â€¬The company had contracted Jeff Veen's Small Batch to build a site that could show how people were talking about the election. And on this day, Veen was in the office to show what he'd come up with, a subdomain on Twitter -- election.twitter.com -- that could track trending terms and follow message volumes about the various political candidates. When Veen's technology went live a few weeks later, it gave everyone a window into the vital discussions happening on Twitter. Williams was positively giddy. It was, Williams explained to Wired, a glimpse of what Twitter could be. This was in Twitter's salad days, literally, when the most common knock on Twitter was that it offered little more than people boasting about what they ate for lunch. ""In the future, Twitter will be less personal,"" Williams explained. ""Less about status, even. It will be more about what's happening with trends and events."" When election day rolled around in November 2008, Twitter had one of its biggest traffic days ever. Users posted some 1.8 million tweets. The mood at the company headquarters that night was ebullient. Sure, there were plenty of happy Obama supporters present, but mostly the team was excited because its servers stayed up under the load. As results came in, cheers went up as the team announced not who won the election, but tweet volumes. Today, both the election site and the server load seem quaint. 1.8 million tweets? Twitter now does that every six minutes. And while that early election site was fun to look at and very interesting, it wasn't truly useful for drawing insight. Twitter's sample size was simply too small. But now, four years later, all of that has changed. Twitter is a big data company now. By its own reckoning, it has some 140 million active monthly users (outside estimates place it at 170 million) who tweet some 400 million times a day. And very, very many of them are talking politics. Now, with help from Topsy, Mellman and NorthStar, Twitter has found a way to extract voter sentiment from those conversations, measure it, and return a daily number. These results track very closely with the Gallup approval rating polling data. Here's how it works. Topsy uses Twitter's high-volume fire hose of data to look at every tweet in the world, and establish a neutral baseline. Separately, it looks at all the tweets about Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, runs a sentiment analysis on them, and compares this analysis to the baseline. It looks at three days' worth of tweets each day, weighting the newer ones higher than then older ones. It then returns a numerical score for each candidate based on how tweets about the individual compare to all tweets as a whole. A completely neutral score would be 50. Anything above that is a net positive, while lower is a net negative. So, for example, if Obama has a score of 38, that would mean that tweets about him are more positive than 38 percent of all other messages on Twitter. The project began when Twitter noticed that conversations about candidates on its own feeds accurately foreshadowed voter sentiments showing up in traditional polls. For example, during a FoxNews debate broadcast in which viewers were asked to rate candidates' responses as either ""answer"" or ""dodge,"" Twitter saw a profound uptick in positive responses about Newt Gingrich. A few days days later, Gingrich was indeed moving up in the polls, but Twitter could see this shift in real-time, much, much earlier, during the debate. Similarly, in the run-up to the Michigan and Arizona primaries, Twitter saw Mitt Romney's follower count surge, while Rick Santorum's sputtered out. When the election results came in, they confirmed what Twitter was seeing internally: Its own social media provided an inside line on what voters were thinking. So Twitter began working with polling groups and Topsy to look into the political data buried in the din of constant online chatter -- they wanted a better way to measure the sentiment voters were expressing in real-time. Topsy would look at every single tweet sent in the world, every day, and create a three-day average baseline. It created an algorithm to understand which tweets skewed positive and which were negative. Together, Twitter and Topsy built a keyword engine, and via repetitive, ongoing spot checks by human observers, they found their algorithm would generate voter-accurate results 90 percent of the time. And that was just the beginning of a refinement process. Every time they ran the data set against human curators and found differences, they were able to improve the algorithm. What Twitter eventually built was the Twindex. It didn't rely on questions, and could be generated in real-time. And when Twitter compared the Twindex for Obama with Gallup's approval rating, the graph was remarkable. ""We pulled this up and said 'Oh, I think we're onto something,'"" says Adam Sharp, Twitter's head of government news and social innovation. ""At first glance, you can readily see some parallels in the data."" As it continued to refine its methods, Twitter found that it had an increasingly strong correlation with Gallup polling data. But more interesting, obviously, is where the numbers diverge. ""If the dials are pointing in different directions, people are saying one thing to pollsters, and another in conversation,"" explains Sharp. ""That is where the Twitter index is providing a real service to journalists, because it's where we are saying we don't have a complete picture, and need to be asking better questions."" Twitter attributes some of this to the differences between ongoing conversations (Twitter) and specific responses to specific questions (traditional polling). For example, in the weeks after Osama Bin Laden was killed, there was a discrepancy in what Twitter and Gallup found. A possible explanation of this is that voters might have answered approval rating poll questions very positively in the weeks after the raid, but in ongoing conversations with each other on Twitter, sentiment focused more on normal, day-to-day concerns about the economy. Twitter hopes to apply the Twindex to other issues -- including, of course, analyzing sentiment around brands. But it's also hopeful that others will take its findings and run with them. ""One of the reasons why we partnered with Topsy was because a secondary goal was to boost the ecosystem around big Twitter data,"" says Sharp. ""To demonstrate the data was big enough, and show that it was available via existing entirely publicly available data."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(CNN) -- A Maryland man who was in the process of being fired was taken into custody Friday after allegedly calling himself a ""joker"" and threatening a supervisor, police said. Police in the counties of Prince George's and Anne Arundel acted on the alleged threat and the use of the word ""joker."" The Joker is the nemesis of the comic character Batman and a character in the film ""The Dark Knight."" Police say the suspect in last Friday's shooting inside a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, where the film was being shown, identified himself afterward to police as ""the Joker."" James Holmes has been arrested in the shooting, in which 12 people were killed and scores more wounded. Movie massacre: 'Oh my God, this is really happening' ""An individual who was in the process of being fired was involved in two separate conversations with his supervisor,"" Prince George's County Police Chief Mark Magaw told reporters. ""Both of those times and both of those telephone conversations he made significant threats to coming back and harming people at the business."" Magaw added, ""In fact, he said 'I'm a joker and I'm gonna load my guns and blow everyone up.'"" Magaw said that, in light of the Aurora incident, ""it's important (for) the community to know that we take all threats seriously and if you're going to make a threat, we will take action."" Magaw said police went Thursday afternoon to the man's apartment in Crofton to interview him and found him wearing a T-shirt that said, ""Guns don't kill people. I do."" Later in the day, a district court judge issued a court order for the man to be held on an emergency commitment. Early Friday, police picked him up from his apartment and took him to Anne Arundel County Medical Center, where he was being given a mental health evaluation, Magaw said. ""Our first and immediate responsibility was to get him mental help, if that was what he needed,"" he said. A search of the man's apartment yielded 25 guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition, he said. ""We believe this was a significant threat based on some of the mental issues this individual has, the weapon capability he had (and) what he said to the employees at Pitney Bowes,"" Magaw said, referring to the business involved. Pitney Bowes issued a statement Friday saying the man was an employee of a subcontractor for the company and ""has not been on any Pitney Bowes property in more than four months."" Pitney Bowes makes postage meters and scales and other products. Magaw said that, given Pitney Bowes' status as a federal contractor, the man could be subject to federal charges. Charges are being reviewed and may be filed over the weekend, Magaw said. Colorado shooting suspect was a psychiatric patient . Opinion: Why the media cannot ignore the killer .

"(CNN) -- The son of one of the world's wealthiest men is under arrest in London after the body of his American-born wife was found in their home this week, her death unexplained. Police stumbled into the mystery Monday, when they arrested Hans Kristian Rausing on drug charges. A search of his home in one of London's most expensive neighborhoods turned up the body of his wife, Eva, spurring police to arrest him again in connection with the death. Eva Rausing had struggled with drug addiction for years, an acquaintance said. ""This has been an existing problem for a long time,"" said Liz Brewer, who knew Rausing through charity and social circles. ""I think the whole thing is a complete tragedy."" The case puts the multimillionaire couple squarely back in the headlines four years after they were arrested on charges of possessing cocaine and heroin, according to media reports at the time. Eva Rausing had tried to smuggle a small amount of crack cocaine and heroin into the U.S. Embassy in London, reports said. She and her husband were arrested when police found more drugs at their house. The pair, however, avoided prosecution. Since then, they have kept a low profile, Forbes magazine said in its annual rich list report this year. ""It's very clear to us Eva had her own problems with drugs and drugs misuse,"" the head of an anti-drug organization told CNN Wednesday. ""She knew prevention was important. She knew how hard it was to get off drugs once you are on drugs,"" said Paul Tuohy, chief executive of Mentor. Eva Rausing had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the charity in the years before her death, Mentor said. Her husband is the son of Hans Rausing, who is worth an estimated $10 billion, thanks to the family's connection to Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval. Hans Kristian Rausing is now receiving medical treatment, police said Wednesday. An autopsy Tuesday failed to determine the cause of Eva Rausing's death, police said. Police refused to name Rausing as the man who was arrested, but a source familiar with the investigation said the man in custody lived at the address where the body was found. The source asked not to be named discussing an ongoing investigation. Eva Rausing gave more than 500,000 pounds ($778,000) to Mentor, said the charity, which runs programs ""to protect children from alcohol and drugs."" J&J heiress, found dead, had high-profile life . Posts on a MySpace page dating back to 2007 that appears to belong to Rausing, but whose authenticity could not be verified, give a picture of her ups and downs. She writes that she went to college in California. ""I had a good time there -- too good, as I dropped out and did not go back to university until the grand old age of 24. Which leaves some troubled years in between ... The beginning was fun, the ending not so fun,"" she writes. ""I was lucky to have a loving supportive family who stood by me, though I didn't always see it that way at the time. So, I cleaned up my act, became a good girl, if maybe a little boring, got a degree in economics, and then got married!"" She says she is a good mother to the couple's four children but, in an apparent reference to her drug abuse issues, she writes of relapsing several years earlier. ""I fell back into the same hole as before and have been there for nearly 7 years. I once read that I would have 7 bad years (I don't normally believe in hocus pocus horoscopes) but so far it has been right, and I'm hoping for 7 good years starting 2007. ""I'm still married, amazingly, to a very kind, patient and loyal husband. I'm very lucky that he has stuck with me -- many would have not."" Hans Kristian Rausing's billionaire father was bought out of the Tetra Laval business founded by his own father. Tetra Pak declined to comment on Eva Rausing's death or her husband's arrest because their branch of the family ""divested its interests in Tetra Pak, and the Tetra Laval Group, in 1995."" CNN's Dominique van Heerden, Susannah Palk and Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","NEW: A MySpace page apparently belonging to Rausing tells of her struggle with drugs .

"(CNN) -- An out-of-control monster truck crashed into the stands at a show in Oregon, injuring three spectators seated in the front row, authorities said. Onlooker Dustin Earls captured video of the scene Saturday at the ""Monster Air 2012"" show in Harrisburg. Earls told CNN he was watching the third drag race of the event when one of the drivers started heading for a mud pit in front of the seating area. ""The truck got a little wild and he hit the mud pit,"" Earls said. ""I thought, 'This guy's just messing around; he'll hit his brakes right here.'"" But the oversized truck didn't stop. Video shot by Earls on his mobile phone shows the truck making a hard right turn and driving straight into the panicked crowd. ""I heard his axle snap as soon as he hit the mud,"" Earls said. ""As soon as he hit that line, he lost control of his steering and his brakes."" Earls' video becomes jumbled as he runs to safety, but the screams of frightened spectators can be heard in the background. A Linn County Sheriff's sergeant told CNN affiliate KVAL three people in the crowd were hurt. Earls said the driver immediately got out of the truck to see if anyone was injured. ""He wanted to know if everything was okay,"" Earls said, ""He was so concerned. He said, 'Oh my God, I can't believe what happened.'"" KVAL reported the driver told authorities the rear wheels on his 1970 Ford spun out in the mud, and he crashed into a barricade. The truck cleared the barricade and its 48-inch tires landed on three spectators, KVAL reported. The sheriff's sergeant told KVAL the victims' injuries were not life-threatening.","Video shot by a spectator shows the truck driving straight into the panicked crowd .

"(CNN) -- The Florida A&M University president's resignation went into effect Monday after the school's board of trustees accepted his request to step down from the job immediately. President James Ammons originally said in a resignation letter that he would retire in October. His departure comes more than seven months after a drum major for the university band died following a hazing incident. Robert Champion, 26, died after being beaten during a hazing ritual on a band bus after a football game in Orlando, Florida. Champion's family said last week that ""the rampant culture of hazing found at FAMU would not and could not be eradicated without some major housecleaning of those who turned a blind eye to the problem."" Ammons waived a 90-day notice of resignation Monday that would have kept him on staff through October. In June, the trustees passed a no-confidence motion in Ammons' performance by an 8-4 vote. ""I hear you loudly and clearly,"" Ammons told the board at the time. ""I understand there are some measures that I have to take as president of this university to fix things, and I am going to fix them."" The university's board plans to appoint Provost Larry Robinson as interim president, but he is subject to confirmation at the next board meeting in August. The board agreed to the delay Monday in order to give members time to get to know Robinson better. The provost is automatically next in line to become head of the university, as part of the university's plan of succession. At Monday's meeting, some board members requested time to consider additional candidates and research Robinson's background. Robinson has a doctorate in nuclear chemistry and has taught in the university's Environmental Sciences Institute. His research interests include environmental chemistry and environmental policy and management, according to a biography posted on the university's website.","NEW: The university's provost is next in line to become president .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- A report released by Cuba's Interior Ministry Friday blamed a Spanish politician for the car crash on Sunday that killed Oswaldo Paya, a prominent Cuban dissident and indicated he could face criminal charges. Earlier Paya's family had cast doubt on the government's assertion that the crash was the result of an accident and said they believed Paya had been targeted. Paya was traveling with another Cuban dissident Harold Cepero, Spanish politician Angel Carromero and Swedish politician Jens Aron Modig when the rental car they were driving in crashed Sunday near Las Gabinas, Cuba. Read more about how the details of the crash are disputed . The Cuban interior ministry report said that the crash took place when Carromero, the driver of the rental car, failed to slow down as the car reached a section of road being repaired. The report quoted witnesses as saying the car was traveling more than 100 kilometers per hour (60 mph) when it lost control, went off the road and crashed into a tree. The report noted that it is against the law in Cuba to drive above 60 kilometers per hour on an unpaved road and to lose control of a vehicle. Spain's Embassy in Havana had earlier said Carromero was behind the wheel when the crash occurred and that Carromero, was mentally traumatized by the accident. Neither Paya nor Cepero were wearing seatbelts, the statement said. Paya died immediately, the statement said, and Cepero passed away after being brought to a nearby hospital. Jens Aron Modig told police, according to the report, that he was dozing off at the time of the accident and woke as the car was going off the road only to lose conciousness as the car crashed. Read more about dozens reported arrested on way to Cuban dissident's funeral . Carromero told police, the report said, that he had not seen any signs warning of the roadwork and was not aware of how fast he was driving when he hit the brakes. Both men were released from the hospital a day after the crash and have been questioned for several days by Cuban police. Neither has spoken publicly about the accident that took the life of Paya, a longtime critic of the Cuban government. Paya most famously organized ""the Varela Project,"" a campaign that collected thousands of signatures calling for changes to Cuba's one-party socialist system of government. While Cuban leaders took little notice of the campaign, Paya's work generated international acclaim and he was the recipient of awards celebrating his work promoting human rights. The U.S. State Department called on the Cuban government to carry out a transparent investigation into Paya's death.","Cuba's Interior Ministry Friday released report on crash that killed prominent Cuban dissident .

"(CNN) -- A patient from a research station in Antarctica is being treated at a hospital in Christchurch, New Zealand, according to the National Science Foundation. The patient ""may require immediate corrective surgery best delivered at a more capable facility than is available at McMurdo,"" the foundation, which manages the U.S. Antarctic Program, said in a statement. ""The facility at McMurdo is equivalent to an urgent-care center in the U.S., and is not equipped for the type of procedure being contemplated."" The patient's identity has not been revealed publicly, an no condition report has been issued. An Australian medical team, which had been asked by the United States to assist, flew into the remote research base on an A319 Airbus from Christchurch. The team landed on an ice runway at McMurdo Station about 1:15 p.m. Thursday (9:15 p.m. ET Wednesday), said Patti Lucas, spokeswoman for the Australian Antarctic Division. They got a chilly reception: temperatures Thursday were -13 degrees Fahrenheit (-25 Celsius), according to the U.S. Antarctic Program. The plane was airborne and en route with the patient back to Christchurch within about 75 minutes, said Debbie Wing, a spokeswoman for the U.S. National Science Foundation, which oversees the facility. The plane landed at 7 p.m. Thursday in Christchurch (3 a.m. Thursday ET), the science foundation said. The patient was in stable condition before the plane's arrival, said Wing, adding that she could not say whether the person's condition is life-threatening. The mission to the hub of the U.S. Antarctic Program was occurring during the Antarctic winter, when there is little daylight for six months. The Australian team was enlisted to carry out the rescue because no U.S. aircraft was in a position to respond quickly, the NSF said in a statement. The U.S., Australian and New Zealand research programs in the Antarctic ""have existing agreements under which such assets may be shared as needed,"" the statement said. From the archives: Stranded American researcher rescued from South Pole . Wing said she could not say whether the patient had become sick or injured while at the facility, but she noted that anyone contemplating a trip to the facility must first pass ""a very rigorous health screening process."" McMurdo can accommodate nearly 1,500 people, but only some 60 to 70 people stay there during the winter, when the extreme weather precludes regular flights, Wing said. From the archives: Doctor rescued from Antarctica in 1999 dies at 57 . The station, established in 1955, is built on volcanic rock on Ross Island, the solid ground farthest south that is accessible by ship, according to the NSF, an independent U.S. government agency. The station is equipped with landing strips built on sea ice and shelf ice, as well as a helicopter pad. Researchers there conduct studies in astrophysics, biology, medicine, geology, glaciology and ocean and climate systems. In 2010, New Zealand's air force -- in two separate incidents -- evacuated two Americans from McMurdo. Last October, the U.S. Air Force rescued an American researcher who had suffered a suspected stroke while working at the South Pole. She was flown from the South Pole to McMurdo Station, then on to Christchurch. In 1999, a then-47-year-old U.S. physician found a lump in her breast while stationed at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Station. Dr. Jerri Nielsen diagnosed herself with breast cancer and commenced treatment on herself with chemotherapeutic agents that were parachuted to the station. It was later revealed, according to a March 2009 article in the Detroit Free Press, that Nielsen -- an emergency room doctor from Cleveland, Ohio -- had performed a biopsy on herself with the help of non-medical crew, who practiced using needles on a raw chicken. Her cancer returned and Nielsen, then 57, died in 2009.

"Jambalo, Colombia (CNN) -- The bodies of two pilots who were aboard a Colombian Air Force plane when it crashed Wednesday in a rebel zone in southwestern Colombia were retrieved Thursday. The plane had been supporting troops fighting rebels in the mountains near the town of Jambalo in Cauca province. Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia rebels said they shot down the plane; government officials said the crash may have been caused by mechanical failure. Firefighters found the remains of one of the plane's pilots at the crash site; FARC rebels had removed the body of the other pilot and turned it over to the Red Cross. After the handover, a group of about 10 FARC rebels attacked army positions, firing homemade mortars called tatucos from atop a mountain upon which a 30-foot wooden cross had been erected. The firefight lasted for about 20 minutes, before the guerrillas escaped. There were no reports of casualties. The plane had been flying over the area in order to provide security for Wednesday's visit by President Juan Manuel Santos to the nearby town of Toribio. Santos was there to meet with villagers over their demands that both government soldiers and members of the FARC leave the area. He has seen his ratings among Colombians drop in recent weeks because of the widespread perception that the security situation has gotten out of control during his leadership.

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder made clear Thursday that the Obama administration recognizes the authority of federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to rule on whether the 2010 health care reform law or any other laws passed by Congress are constitutional. The declaration by Holder came in a letter to a federal appeal's court that had ordered the government to respond by Thursday in a legal and political spat over the health care law championed by President Barack Obama. The attorney general personally met the deadline with a three-page, single-spaced letter-- following the specific instructions of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is hearing a challenge to the health care law. Holder's letter affirmed the government's stance that federal judges indeed have the authority to decide the fate of the 2010 Affordable Care Act -- and any other law Congress passes. ""The power of the courts to review the constitutionality of legislation is beyond dispute,"" Holder said. Read the letter (PDF) His personal involvement in crafting the response signaled the issue's hot-button importance within the administration four days after Obama made controversial remarks that advised the Supreme Court not to take an ""unprecedented"" step by overturning the health care reform law. Obama and the White House have since attempted to clarify the president's initial comments, which were in response to a reporter's question about the Supreme Court's three days of hearings on the health care law last week. However, Holder's letter made clear that the substance of Obama's remarks were in line with the administration's recognition that the high court has the power of judicial review. ""The President's remarks were fully consistent with the principles described herein,"" concluded Holder's letter. The dispute involving the court and the executive branch has highlighted the political dispute over whether the health care law will survive various legal challenges, including the pending Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of a key provision. The high court's ruling, expected in June, would take precedence over any other courts hearing similar appeals. The outcome of the health care cases in an election year could have a lasting impact on Obama's re-election chances as well as the credibility of the federal courts, which are supposed to be beyond politics. On Monday, Obama said he was ""confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically-elected Congress, and I just remind conservative commentators that for years, what we've heard is, the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint, that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a dually constituted and passed law."" Some conservative critics interpreted those remarks as a challenge to judicial authority, suggesting Obama was putting political pressure on the high court. A day after the president's initial remarks, the three Republican-appointed appellate judges held a hearing on a challenge to the health care law from physician-owned hospitals. Judge Jerry Smith, a Reagan appointee, was especially tough on a Justice Department lawyer defending the law and specifically mentioned the Obama remarks from the day before. ""I'm referring to statements by the president in the past few days to the effect, and I'm sure you've heard about them, that it is somehow inappropriate for what he termed 'unelected' judges to strike acts of Congress that have enjoyed -- he was referring to, of course, Obamacare -- to what he termed broad consensus in majorities in both houses of Congress,"" Smith said. ""That has troubled a number of people who have read it as somehow a challenge to the federal courts or to their authority or to the appropriateness of the concept of judicial review,"" Smith continued. ""And that's not a small matter. So I want to be sure that you're telling us that the attorney general and the Department of Justice do recognize the authority of the federal courts through unelected judges to strike acts of Congress or portions thereof in appropriate cases."" Government lawyer Dana Lydia Kaersvang appeared initially taken aback, but replied such authority has existed for centuries. Nevertheless, Smith and Judges Emilio Garza and Leslie Southwick then ordered the Justice Department to submit by noon Thursday Texas time a three-page, single-spaced letter addressing whether the Obama administration believes courts do indeed enjoy that power. In a sign of the political nature of the imbroglio, Smith's phrasing in open court of the law as ""Obamacare"" used a term coined by opponents of the law. Holder's letter Thursday offered repeated deference to the power of the federal courts. He said the Justice Department ""has not in this litigation, nor in any other litigation of which I am aware, ever asked this or any other court to reconsider or limit long-established precedent concerning judicial review of the constitutionality of federal legislation."" Legal analysts say the administration is walking a fine line in trying to tamp down criticism from legal and political circles. ""There are two things going on, of course,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a prominent Washington attorney, law professor, and publisher of SCOTUSBLOG.com. ""First, Holder (in the letter) says that we have an argument courts can't hear this case. Second, if you can hear the case, you certainly have the power to invalidate part of the statute as constitutional. But (he says) you shouldn't do that lightly."" The last part of Holder's letter ""is how they are framing the president's point -- that the courts need to give the elected branches deference,"" Goldstein added. ""It's a respectful letter, but it has an element of, 'What are you talking about, the president never said that.' "" The specific issue before the appeals court was a provision in the health care law restricting doctor-owned hospitals from expanding their facilities. The challenge was brought by an East Texas spine-and-joint hospital, and the case is separate from the cases being considered by the Supreme Court. After his initial remarks Monday proved controversial, Obama sought to clarify them Tuesday. ""The point I was making is that the Supreme Court is the final say on our Constitution and our laws, and all of us have to respect it, but it's precisely because of that extraordinary power that the court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature, our Congress,"" Obama said. ""And so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like this."" The imbroglio continued Thursday, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, using a Rotary Club speech in Lexington to tell Obama to ""back off"" and let the courts do their work without political interference. ""The president crossed a dangerous line this week. And anyone who cares about liberty needs to call him out on it,"" McConnell said. ""The independence of the court must be defended. Regardless of how the justices decide this case, they're answerable, above all, to the Constitution they swore to uphold. The fact that this president does not appear to feel similarly constrained to respect their independence doesn't change that one bit. So respectfully, I would suggest the president back off."" Even Obama's former Harvard Law School professor and mentor, Laurence Tribe, said the president ""obviously misspoke,"" telling the Wall Street Journal that ""I don't think anything was gained by his making these comments and I don't think any harm was done, except by public confusion."" Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney faced skeptical reporters Thursday just before Holder's letter arrived at the appeals court. Carney said it was ""preposterous"" to suggest Obama does not respect the power of courts to rule on the constitutionality of legislation. ""It is kind of ridiculous to believe that the president wasn't talking about the context of the (health care) case, but I completely concede that he did not describe the context when he took the question and answered it on Monday,"" Carney said. Two years ago, Obama attracted similar outcry when he criticized the high court's conservative majority for striking down a campaign finance reform law, giving corporations greater power to spend in federal elections. Some conservative legal sources privately expressed disappointment in the appeals court's order this week, saying it appeared punitive and petty to demand the Justice Department defend a position it had never disputed in court. ""It was like he (the judge) was giving a homework assignment to an unprepared student,"" said one right-leaning lawyer, who opposes the health care law. ""It has the effect of putting the judiciary on the defensive, and could give rise to concerns the courts will look at the law from a political, not constitutional, perspective."" The Supreme Court held three days of oral arguments on the health care last week. The justices have not, and by custom will not, comment on pending appeals. Their written opinions, due in the next three months, will be the final word on the Affordable Care Act's constitutionality, particularly the ""individual mandate"" provision that requires most Americans to have health insurance by 2014 or face a financial penalty.

"Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- It's after midnight, and 100 or so skinny young people in jeans and jackets and wearing anarchy slogans walk down the cobblestone streets of Tampa's historic district, dancing and chanting: ""1,2,3,4 -- I declare a class war."" Dozens of buff sheriff's officers trail behind the demonstrators in Ybor City. But they are dressed more for war than protest in their combat boots and tan cargo pants, guns strapped to their thighs. They overlook the comments from the kids at the back who ask each other, ""When are we going to smash some sh--?"" The officers' eyes are on the menacing-looking muscular men with shaved heads, their fists balled up by their sides, walking quietly alongside the chanters. Peering down from the wrought-iron balconies of nearby restaurants and bars are some of the day's conventioneers, suited men whose first-day passes to the Republican National Convention dangle from red-white-and-blue lanyards. The men snap photos with cell phones, and their faces grow more serious as the last of the protesters come into view, carrying something high about the crowd's heads. It look likes a scene from the Old Testament: A golden animal is hoisted in the air. It catches the street light as it moves through the crowd. A conventioneer leans over and loudly says to his buddy, ""Look! It's an elephant in chains. Are they protesting us?"" In a word: yes. And they're clearly glad someone's finally noticed. It's a peaceful protest on the first day of the Republican National Convention. It is also illegal. The city has passed an ordinance that forbids protesters from wearing masks and carrying puppets -- unless they are inspected by authorities in advance. Police say they are a security risk. On this night, a bearded man is taking his chances: He balances a papier-mâché hammerhead shark face on his head. A shark fin pokes out from his back. He says he's portraying a predatory banker. A 19-year-old wearing a bandana on his face is the single protester arrested on Monday. His friends say they don't think he heard the police order him to take it off. ""There is a lot of chaos and confusion in these kinds of protests. What we are trying to do is create more inventive ways to express our issues and to stand out from the crowd,"" says Nathan Pim, the 27-year-old founder of the Florida Autonomous Playhouse puppet troupe. He is a man who believes firmly in the effectiveness of protest puppets -- and doesn't want the city pulling protesters' strings. ""I can lecture about helping end discrimination against the homeless all the time and no one will listen. If I do it dressed as a panda, for some reason people listen."" When Pim and his wife Jillian, also a puppeteer, heard the GOP convention was coming to Florida, they quit their paying jobs in Fort Lauderdale and moved to Tampa to protest full time. Pim's pet issue is helping the homeless and fighting Florida's foreclosure crisis. He is a regular volunteer for Food Not Bombs, which feeds the homeless and the people who come out for protests. Unsure of the risk, the Autonomous Playhouse puppet troupe held off on bringing their creations to the Monday protests. ""We didn't know if they were really enforcing the ban or not so we were going to wait and see,"" Pim said. ""Plus we had rehearsals for our show"" at the New World Brewery in Ybor City. The ordinance didn't stop Kelly Benjamin, who abided by the letter of the law, got approval and marched wearing a giant Mitt Romney effigy -- ""Ritt Momney"" -- bearing a sign that says ""King of the 1%."" ""It's really ridiculous how much opposition we have had,"" he says. He had his puppet approved by the authorities, he says, but it doesn't seem to matter. ""They keep trying to confiscate him and it's gotten so bad I now carry the ordinance with me that shows I'm within the law."" Benjamin says he knows the police are just doing their job -- and that maybe they have a particular paranoia about what might be hiding inside the puppet. He calls it a ""scatological fetish."" ""They think all the anarchists will be throwing poop at them."" Safe within the boundaries of the brewery, Pim and his fellow performers wait at a back table for the evening's performances to start. The opening act is by the activist group Women from Code Pink. They wear bright pink boas and strap on large pink vagina puppets that have bags of fake money on them. They carry signs that say ""read my lips end the war on women."" After the dancing vaginas exit the performance area, Autonomous Playhouse sets up its hand-painted stage. Ukulele music begins, and up pops a puppet named Momma Nature. She is a tree with a bushy Afro of leaves and a Southern accent. The puppet's creator, Haylee Becker, 20, dropped out of college to work full time with her fellow puppet troupe members. She met them while volunteering for Food Not Bombs back when she was in high school. ""As just one person I lose my voice too quickly,"" she says, ""but together we sure as hell can make change."" Becker says she got involved in feeding the homeless early in life when her parents would write on the invitation to her kiddie parties to bring canned goods rather than gifts. ""Personally, I wanted the gifts, but as I got older I saw how many people needed help."" The tree puppet in this performance, entitled ""Momma Nature vs. the Foreclosure Crisis,"" tells the audience she's never missed a mortgage payment. The bank threatens her with foreclosure because of a bad treehouse mortgage. Pim and fellow troop member Nikki Wright introduce the tree to several menacing puppets. A wolf government agent sings ""You've got no value when you've got no worth."" A tick banker calls Momma Nature a deadbeat and hands her over to an unfeeling panda judge. A puppet cop throws Momma Nature in the slammer. After her performance, Becker reflects quietly on her mission. ""I feel obligated to be here and be a part of this protest,"" she says. This is the role she wants to play in the national conversation about politics. She doesn't plan to vote in November. ""Sure, there are things like abortion and health care that could go wrong if the wrong guy gets in office,"" she says. ""But for personal reasons I don't think my voice will make that big of a difference. ""I'll vote in other ways: There are other ways to have your voice heard than pushing a button every four years."" For now, that voice will be heard through puppets. Agencies warn of anarchist activity at conventions .","Tampa banned the use of puppets in protests at the GOP convention.
But that hasn't stopped some protesters from donning masks and puppet heads.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's oldest son blasted his famous aunts and uncles on Twitter on Thursday for taking his grandmother away and keeping her out of touch for 10 days. ""I'm really angry and hurt,"" Prince Jackson tweeted. His tweets came just hours after Katherine Jackson returned to the Calabasas, California, home where she has been raising Prince, 15; Paris, 14; and Prince Michael II, 10, who's also known as Blanket. A judge suspended Katherine Jackson as their guardian Wednesday because of her absence, which her own lawyers suggested might have been against her will. TJ Jackson, the 34-year-old son of Tito Jackson, was named temporary guardian. ""Although I am happy my grandma was returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly she was lied to,"" Prince Jackson tweeted. Jackson family drama an unwanted reality show . Janet, Jermaine, Randy and Rebbie Jackson teamed up to take their 82-year-old mother to a spa near Tucson, Arizona, on July 15, later saying it was under a doctor's orders. The three children, who have been in their grandmother's custody since their father's death three years ago, became upset after several days of not hearing from her. Critical tweets have flowed from sister Paris for days, but her older and usually less outspoken brother is now being heard. ""I have been holding off on backing up my sister and her tweets avidly because I was waiting for the time to reveal my side,"" Prince Jackson tweeted. His tweets included a photo of his cell phone screen, which he said showed ""a group chat I had started to several family members. This group text message I had started was replied to but they didn't know that I could see the responses. For this whole time, they denied us contact to our grandmother."" The image shows Prince texting to aunts Rebbie and Janet Jackson: . ""This is enough so I am texting you for the simple fact that WE DEMAND TO SPEAK TO MY GRANDMA NOW!!!"" The reply, apparently from Janet Jackson, was: ""Don't let them pls."" The text exchange came three hours after Janet Jackson was seen on security camera video apparently attempting to take Paris Jackson's cell phone away in the driveway of Katherine Jackson's home. Janet Jackson's representative did not immediately reply to CNN's request for comment. The Twitter posting referred to lessons taught to him by his father. ""As long as I can remember my dad had repeatedly warned me of certain people and their ways,"" he tweeted. The tweet concluded with this: ""If you continue with your lies I will continue with the truth."" It was signed ""Michael Jackson Jr."" The tweets mysteriously disappeared several hours later, replaced with a message disavowing them. By mid-afternoon, when the children done with summer school, Paris posted tweets explaining: . ""the thing my brother tweeted last night was the last true thing he tweeted.. he was hacked saying what we tweeted was false.. prince will repost the image of the text . 'if you continue with your lives , i will continue with the truth' prince wanted me to tell you guys that okay . please know its us tweeting"" Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian . Before Katherine Jackson began the long drive back to California on Wednesday, she appeared on camera and read a statement to ABC News. As her children Rebbie, Jermaine and Janet stood behind her, she read from a yellow notepad: . ""I am devastated that while I've been away ... my grandchildren have been taken away from me, and I'm coming home to see about that,"" Jackson said. The network was not allowed to ask her any questions. At a hearing Wednesday, Katherine Jackson's attorney, Sandra Ribera, told Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff that there was reason to believe Jackson had been held against her will. Beckloff suspended her as the children's custodian because she may be ""prevented from acting as a guardian because of the acts of third parties."" Another one of her lawyers, Perry Sanders, said he would meet with his client Thursday before filing a petition to restore her as custodian. Katherine Jackson was unaware of the controversy swirling around her family for the past week, he said. In her statement, Katherine Jackson disputed the judge's findings. ""I am here today to let everybody know that I am fine and I am here with my children, and my children would never do a thing to me like that, holding me against my will. It's very stupid for people to think that,"" she said. The judge also ordered that singer Diana Ross, whom Michael Jackson named as backup guardian in his will, and Debbie Rowe, the biological mother of the two oldest children, be given notice of the order.

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova's impressive record of winning matches that go to three sets in 2012 shows no sign of ending after the Russian beat Nadia Petrova in the U.S. Open fourth round to set up a quarterfinal meeting with Marion Bartoli. Sharapova won 6-1, 4-6, 6-4, but was rattled by Petrova winning four games in a row that enabled the 19th seed to take the second set and lead 2-0 in the third before an hour and 13 minute rain break. The No.3 seed took full advantage of the delay, speaking to her father Yuri, before returning to seal a two hour, 14-minute victory to give Sharapova her 11th win in three-set matches in 2012 and her 23rd victory in 24 three-setters since the start of 2011. ""It's a nice statistic,"" said Sharapova after her last 16 win over her fellow Russian. ""I don't really think about it going into a new third set situation, because every match is different, whether you started slow and came back in the second, or whether you had a letdown in the second. ""But overall, I always think that no matter how you start the match, it's always how you finish. Whether it's an hour or three hours you're out on the court, I don't want to give up until the last point. ""That's pretty much the mentality I try to have going into a third set."" Having been in the lead in the third set, Petrova found the defeat difficult to take. ""I had been in control in the third set,"" said the No.19 seed. ""I had everything in my hands. ""Maria looked hesitant and she couldn't get a hold of her game. But then after the rain break, actually it went in her favour because she had time to think, regroup, talk to her coach. ""And then she came out completely cool and collected. She started playing big tennis. Unfortunately, luck was on her side."" Serena cruises into last 16 with revenge win over Makarova . Frenchwoman Bartoli also had to come from behind to beat the fifth seed Petra Kvitova, but did so in style, winning 12 of 13 games to take a 1-6, 6-2, 6-0 victory. Earlier on Sunday defending champion Sam Stosur ended 18-year-old Briton Laura Robson's impressive U.S. Open run with a 6-4 6-4 win in the fourth round of the U.S. Open. Robson, who had beaten Kim Clijsters and Li Na to reach the fourth round, saved eight match points as she came from 5-2 down to get back on serve but Australian Stosur broke again to clinch victory and a match with top seed Victoria Azarenka. ""I'm definitely disappointed,"" said former Wimbledon junior champion Robson, who will rise from 89th to 75th in the rankings after doing so well at Flushing Meadows. ""I felt like I didn't play as well as I did in my last three matches. I just hit too many unforced errors.""","Maria Sharapova beats Nadia Petrova to reach U.S. Open quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- The records kept tumbling for Michael Phelps Thursday as he beat arch-rival Ryan Lochte to win the men's 200m individual medley. It was the 16th gold medal of his remarkable Olympic career, but his first in an individual event at the London Games. The 27-year-old from Baltimore becomes the first man to win gold in the same event at three consecutive Olympics and extends his record breaking overall medals tally to 20. It came just 48 hours after he won his 18th and 19th Olympic medals to overtake Russian gymnast Larisa Latynina in the all-time list. Infographic: Records, medals and Phelps -- The numbers behind London 2012 . Phelps led from start to finish to hold off Lochte down the final freestyle leg to win in one minute 54.27 seconds, just 0.04secs outside his own Olympic record. Hungary's Laszlo Cseh claimed the bronze medal. Lochte had taken bronze behind fellow American Tyler Clary in the earlier final of the men's 200m backstroke and Phelps said his rival for gold would have been feeling that effort. ""That was cool, I knew Ryan (Lochte) would be tough but coming off the 200 back that was a hard double,"" he told BBC Sport.

"Washington (CNN) -- Think this current climate of political polarization is bad? Things could get even uglier in 2013. With a third of the Senate and every seat in the House up for election this year, each side is already bragging about how likely it is they will win back or take over the next Congress. But if the past three years are any indicator, no matter if the Republicans or Democrats control the House or Senate -- or both -- gridlock, brinkmanship and stalemate could continue to plague the next president and frustrate the American electorate. The ongoing back and forth Friday between the White House and Republican leadership over exactly who is at fault for the weak economy offers a glimpse into what's in store. ""One of the things that people get so frustrated about is that instead of actually talking about what would help, we get wrapped up in these political games. That's what we need to put an end to,"" President Barack Obama said on Friday, a day when politicos on both sides of the aisle played the blame game over the country's fiscal troubles. Voters have been clear in expressing their displeasure with Congress, whose approval ratings -- currently only 15% of Americans polled think Congress is doing a good job -- have been in the basement for much of the past few years. And it doesn't stop there. Just look at, for instance, Congress' work habits. The Republican-controlled House's frequent election-year recesses do little to clear the mountain of legislative work off their plates and have rankled such Democratic colleagues as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. ""Instead of recessing yet again, the House should remain at work and pass critical legislation that will create jobs for the middle class that will actually be signed into law. Republicans must not run out the clock on the economy,"" Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, this week, adding that the upcoming recess is the ninth weeklong break this year. Whether President Obama or Republican Mitt Romney occupies the Oval Office next year, both men are facing an indigestion-inducing plate full of domestic problems. Either one could, for instance, have to preside over a dramatic overhaul of the health care reform law if the Supreme Court strikes down the individual coverage mandate as unconstitutional this month. The original law passed in 2010 without a single Republican vote in the House or the Senate. The backlog of bills that have passed in one chamber but are in limbo in another include the hotly debated transportation bill. Many House Republicans want any deal on the transportation construction measure to include approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. In the Senate, both parties are at loggerheads on the best way to address mushrooming student loan rates. If the balance of power in the Senate shifts to the Republicans, as some political analysts expect, or Democrats and Republican end up with a near equal number of seats, partisan gridlock could become even worse. Both the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg Political Report  suggest that at least two to four Senate seats are in play, including open seats in the battleground states of Virginia and Wisconsin. Seats in Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico and Maine are also competitive. ""You can expect these bitter times to continue,"" said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of the book ""It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism."" It's little wonder why. A new Pew Research Center study found that the nation is more politically polarized than it has been in the past 25 years and ""the values gap between Republicans and Democrats is now greater than gender, age, race or class divides."" So, there's little chance of compromise on solutions for shoring up the ailing economy and stanching job losses as the country braces for the impact of more than $1 trillion in mandatory budget cuts set to kick in next year. Should Obama win re-election, he'll be a second-term president facing a narrow window to accomplish policy goals before he enters the lame duck phase of his office. ""If president Obama is re-elected he will have to work with a Republican Senate to define his legacy,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of The Rothenberg Political Report. Obama's ""big opportunity will be 2013."" That's the same year sequestration, massive mandatory across the board budget cuts, are triggered as part of a congressional deal that allowed Obama to raise the debt ceiling. The large defense budget, which many Republican lawmakers defend as necessary to maintain, will face substantial cuts. Ironically, Obama may have to take a harder, more partisan line in order to get his agenda passed, Mann said. ""It's his second term. The country is facing serious problems,"" Mann said. ""If the Republicans are playing an opposition game I can't imagine he can peacefully engage in constructive negotiations with (Republicans). He would find the same problem he faces today."" Things aren't likely to go much easier for Romney. If Romney should win the general election and his party maintains control of the House and ekes out a Senate majority, the newly minted president may still face some political headaches. Candidates down ballot may get a boost from a Romney win, but it is unlikely his party will net the 60 seats needed for a filibuster-proof Senate majority. He'll also face intense pressure from his party to keep his campaign promises and steer clear of compromise. ""If Romney is elected he'll have a brief honeymoon period,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""In this polarized era I see no reason for optimism there.","Partisan bickering likely to continue after elections .

"(CNN) -- Cast your mind back to 2008 and to the Beijing Olympics, a time when few had experienced the joy of hashtags and the ""Like"" button was still a twinkle in Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's eye. Then the ""Twittersphere"" had just three million ""tweeps"", while social-networking monolith Facebook had a ""modest"" 100 million users. A lot can change in four years...

'Unbelievable' Ye Shiwen sparks debate . No wonder then that 64 years after London staged the post-World War II ""Austerity Games"", this time around the Olympics has been dubbed the first ""Social Media Games.""

Michael Phelps cements position as all-time great . After finishing fourth in the 10 meter synchronized final, British diver Tom Daley was subjected to insults via Twitter, some of which related to his late father. ""Four years ago, Twitter was only two years old, and it had around 3 million users,"" explained Kate Bussman, author of A Twitter Year: 365 days in 140 characters. ""There are now over 140m, and it's far more mainstream. Social media generally has become far more popular in that time period, especially when it comes to posting while watching sports events. ""Watching with a 'second screen' (i.e. a laptop, tablet or smart phone) has become much more popular."" Twitter's expansion can also be explained by the proliferation of many of the world's top athletes equipping themselves with official Facebook pages and ""verified"" Twitter accounts as a way of interacting with their fans.. ""Social media connects the world in real time and fosters a constant conversation about sports, which is exactly what sports fans crave,"" said Lowell Taub, head of sports endorsements at CAA Sports, which represents stars like David Beckham and Dwayne Wade. ""For the reporting of results and sharing of experiences by those who are on-hand at the Olympics, these Games will be unlike any other."" According to Bussmann, the links between sports and social media will continue to grow, because followers and likes will ultimately translate into dollars. ""They can talk to their fans directly, they can talk to each other, they can promote the image of themselves they most want to project, whether that's by mentioning their charity work, family etc,"" she outlined. ""Remember that the more fans a sports star has, the more money they can negotiate when it comes to sponsorship deals. Your Facebook and Twitter stats are a great way to prove how popular you are."" Taub confirmed an athlete's ""social media footprint"" can become a factor during negotiations with potential sponsors, explaining that the more passionate a sports star's supporters, the more appealing they appear to a brand. But Taub also stressed millions of followers on Twitter or thousands of ""likes"" on Facebook is useless without sporting success. ""Partners look for ambassadors who have a large and loyal audience,"" he said. ""Social media has become a measurable way for brands to connect with an ambassador's extremely loyal fan base. ""While having a robust social media presence is not necessarily the deciding factor, a brand that intends to go heavy with a social strategy is absolutely considering the athlete's social footprint. ""Nonetheless, all the traditional variables still apply -- the profile of the athlete's sport; the athlete's past performance and results. Good brand ambassadors who have unique Olympic journeys."" While posting a picture on Twitter is a quick and easy way of promoting sponsors, do athletes risk losing their fan base if social media is used purely for gratuitous advertising? ""Our clients like to communicate with their fans and believe in their partners' messages, brand, and activations,"" replied Taub, ""so sharing that information with their fans seems to come very naturally."" Bussmann warned against using Twitter as a purely sponsor-driven outlet, saying: ""I imagine it will continue, but it's hard to say how people will react. Like anything, if it's done gratuitously or obnoxiously, that may get people's backs up."" Some Olympians have also struggled to remember that a hasty tweet and too much social media exposure can prove costly. Greek triple jumper Voula Papachristou was kicked out of her country's Olympic squad before the Games began for a tweet which was judged to have mocked African immigrants into the European nation. Australian swimmer Emily Seebohm has also allowed Twitter to ruin her Olympic dream. The 20-year-old was the favorite heading into the women's 100 meter backstroke final, having flirted with the world record during the earlier rounds. But Seebohm was beaten into the silver medal position by American teen sensation Missy Franklin and she blamed her infatuation with social media for her below-par performance. ""I don't know, I just felt like I didn't really get off social media and get into my own head,"" Seebohm was reported to have said after Monday's final by British newspaper The Daily Telegraph. ""Maybe I just started believing that and just thought I'd already won by the time I had swum and I hadn't even swum yet. ""When people tell you a thousand times 'you'll get the gold', somewhere in your mind you are going to say 'you've done it'."" Seebohm's alarming revelation illustrates the impact social media is having not only on the consumption of sport, but also on the athletes themselves. So, with plenty of gold medals still to be won, maybe Olympians would be best advised to take a social media sabbatical if they want to clinch glory at London 2012.","Opening ceremony of London 2012 saw more tweets than entire Beijing Games .

"(CNN) -- Last week, we gave you digital tips and tricks for surviving a layoff -- the first seven days, at least. Now, here we are again, an entire Wednesday later, prepared to help you gird your loins for the job search ahead. So, wipe the Cheeto dust from your fingers and peel yourself out of that body-shaped imprint you've made on your bed. Your bout in the ranks of the unemployed probably won't be short -- on average, unemployed workers have been jobless for 40 weeks, a number that hasn't changed much in the last six months. But of course, you should aim to make it as brief as possible. ""The longer you're laid off, the harder it is to get back in the market,"" says Nicole Williams, LinkedIn's connection director. Act fast to get the ball rolling before you forget what it feels like to wear real pants and chit-chat over a box of donuts (with other people, that is). One positive note: The whole ordeal might not be as miserable as you think (""funemployment,"" anyone?). Last year, an Australian study found that unemployed folks were actually happier than the drones stuck in miserable jobs. Maybe this'll be the best thing that ever happened to you. (Cheerleader jump! Cheerleader jump! Rah! Rah!) Read on for a few social network to-dos to get you back in the rat race. Target your pleas. Last week we covered strategically letting your circles know about the change in employment status (in short: Be brief, be upbeat, and only tell those who could specifically help you). A similar principle is at play as you're seeking out potential business contacts to bug. ""A mistake a lot of people make is just contacting everyone they can find with a generic note,"" Williams says. A better approach: Figure out something (or someone) you have in common with the individual, and send a personalized note along with your Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn request. ""You have to get them to be interested in your situation,"" she adds, ""because people are busy, and why should they worry about your career?"" Stalk potential employers. Not literally, of course. But when job-searching online, most people tend to think about job boards such as Monster.com and Craigslist.com. While there's nothing wrong with keeping an eye out for appropriate openings (and plenty of people indeed find new gigs on such sites), massive job listings are often a slang word that rhymes with ""duster-duck"" -- meaning they're disorganized, crowded and teeming with humanity. Sometimes a job will be posted days after the hiring managers have made a decision, when corporate policy requires it. Months-old listings will mysteriously float to the top long after they've been filled. And in the journalism world, for example, a listing on industry tracker MediaBistro.com can yield hundreds of enthusiastic applications. Go ahead and wade in the morass of job aggregators, but we recommend taking a more targeted approach in the meantime. Brainstorm some corporations that should be dying to hire you, and figure out how you can keep dibs on them. ""That way you'll be privy to any movement in jobs or anything they're doing industry-wise,"" Williams says. If the company's striking out on a new project that matches your skills, you have an in to request an informational interview with a higher-up over there, for example. And if you note that someone with your dream job just departed for Company X, you can swoop in. Poke around their website for an RSS feed of company news and add it to your own feed reader (such as Google Reader) for easy stalk-age. Follow the company on LinkedIn (go to the company tab along the top, search, and follow) to see who's leaving (and who will, presumably, leave behind a vacancy), and what current employees are in your circle -- they're your goldmines in the ""Whom do I address this cover letter to?"" game. Downplay the layoff in your job apps. Here's the thing: If you're the right candidate, then you're the right candidate -- whether you're currently at another company or currently signing up for market research focus groups to pay the bills between rounds of job-searching. While there's no shame in having been let go (at this point, we all know upstanding employees who fell victim to the economy), your cover letter should shimmer with hireability, not with the grayish Braille of woe-is-me teardrops. Think of it this way: If you come across as defensive, insecure or bitter about the layoff, you'll raise all sorts of red flags in a hiring manager's mind. But if you're bursting with confidence and talent and good ideas (and, oh yeah, it comes up in the interview that you're looking for a new job because you don't have one but the job termination was circumstantial and, hey, here's a recommendation letter from your former boss), you seem like the kind of employee who always lands on his feet. And in this earthquake of an economy, a little catlike agility is a very good thing.","Our Netiquette columnists offer advice on digital job-hunting tools .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Wednesday declared victory over fellow Republican Joe Miller in the nation's last Senate race, saying the result of her write-in candidacy was a ""miracle."" ""Against all odds, we as Alaskans together made history,"" Murkowski told cheering supporters in Anchorage. If she prevails in a potential challenge, Murkowski would become the second person to ever win a write-in bid for the U.S. Senate. Murkowski's statement was the climax in the state's bitter and prolonged Senate battle. It was essentially a triumphant declaration of beating back a three-pronged attack: from Miller, from the Tea Party Express, and from Sarah Palin. ""We've said all along, we'll wait for the votes to be counted,"" Murkowski Campaign Manager Kevin Sweeney told CNN. ""By any standard, this was a clear victory. This was a whuppin',"" Sweeney added. Currently, Alaska's Division of Elections is counting 100,868 votes for Murkowski versus 90,448 for Miller. By that count, Murkowski leads by 10,420. However, 8,153 of Murkowski's votes have been contested by the Miller campaign. If, as Miller's side would like, all of those contested votes are thrown out -- an almost impossible scenario to many election and legal observers -- Murkowski would still win the race with the uncontested votes alone. ""You can see that the numbers just won't add up,"" Sweeney told CNN, referring to Miller's hopes of pulling out a win despite the rising tide against him. The Associated Press has called the race for Murkowski. If the outcome stands in the face of legal challenges, despite a count of any outstanding ballots or a potential recount from Miller, it would be only the second time a person won a write-in campaign for the Senate. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina won a write-in campaign in 1954. At this point, Miller is conceding nothing. In an interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News, Miller said he is ""less cautiously optimistic"" given the vote tallies. But Miller was emphatic about ensuring the integrity of the vote-counting process, asserting that the difference was ""less than 1 percent."" He said he may request a recount, that he wants to ensure that some military ballots were mailed out, and that the difference between his votes and Murkowski's may shift if a ""consistent standard"" for evaluating the write-in ballots is applied. Evaluating the write-in ballots has been controversial. As Alaska's Division of Elections tallied them, some ballots that contained misspellings or variations of ""Lisa Murkowski"" have been credited as votes for her. That issue of evaluating a ""voter's intent"" has infuriated the Miller campaign, prompting it to launch a federal lawsuit in hopes of annulling the count of misspelled or incongruous ballots. Miller's campaign blasted the Division of Elections' standards as ""extraordinarily ambiguous."" A Miller loss would be a huge slap to Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Express. Palin endorsed Miller over Murkowski for the state's GOP Senate primary, and the national Tea Party group followed suit. Murkowski lost the primary in August -- and conceded the race. Shortly after, Murkowski launched a write-in bid to retain her seat. Murkowski was first appointed to her post by her father, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski, in 2002. Palin defeated him in the 2006 GOP gubernatorial primary. CNN's Kristi Kreck contributed to this report.","Murkowski thanks Alaskans for helping make history .

"London (CNN) -- With 50 meters to go, it looked like Oscar Pistorius was cruising to gold in the men's 200 meters. But then, to his outside, a flash of green went by, a 20-year-old Brazilian who rocketed past him to upset the most famous Paralympian of all time. Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira beat Pistorius to the line, winning gold in 21.45. South Africa's Pistorius took silver in 21.52, unable to come near his world record set Saturday. The bronze went to Blake Leeper of the United States. On Saturday, the third day of the Games, Pistorius blazed through the men's 200-meter-T44 qualifier with a world-record time of 21.30 seconds. The Paralympic movement classifies events, using terms like T44, to group competitors based on their disability. Pistorius, who uses carbon fiber prosthetic blades, made it to the semifinals of the individual 400-meter and the 400-meter relay final at the Olympics last month, running against athletes with no disablities. Besides the 200-meter run, he will also compete in the Paralympics in the men's 100-meter-T44 (set for Wednesday and Thursday) and the 400-meter-T44 (happening Friday and Saturday), both of which he won in Beijing four years ago. Pistorius, nicknamed the Blade Runner, is also part of South Africa's 4x100-meter T42/T46 relay team, which is scheduled to race Wednesday. U.S. two-sport athlete Rudy Garcia-Tolson, a day after finishing ninth in the men's 200 meters (T42) on the track, won a silver in the 200-meter individual medley. Yevheniy Bohodayko of Ukraine won the event in a world record time of 2:33.13. Garcia-Tolson set an American record of 2:33.94. Jessica Long of the United States, who was looking to add a fourth gold medal in swimming in the games, finished fifth in the 50-meter freestyle (S8). Her teammate, Mallory Weggemann, won the event in 31.13, edging 13-year-old Maddison Elliott of Australia. Long, a 20-year-old from Baltimore, is entered in nine events in the meet. She won three gold medals in Athens at age 12 and four more in Beijing. She also has a silver and bronze from 2008, giving her 12 career Paralympic Games medals. Long was born in Siberia with fibular hemimelia, meaning she had no fibulas and other bones in lower legs, according to her website. She was adopted by her U.S. parents at age 13 months and had her lower legs amputated five months later. Australian Jacqueline Freney won her third gold medal with a world record in the women's 200-individual medley (SM7). The thin line: Paralympic classification . At the weightlifting venue, Fatma Omar of Egypt set a world record in women's powerlifting. The 38-year-old won her 56-kilogram (123-pound) division with a lift of 140 kilograms (309 pounds). New Zealand's Phillipa Gray and Laura Thompson also set a world record Sunday in the qualification round of the women's individual B pursuit, an event on a tandem bicycle for the visually impaired. They won the final, beating the Irish team of Catherine Walsh and Francine Meehan. China has a huge lead in medals, topping the table with 87. The Chinese added to their total on Sunday with golds in table tennis from Feng Panfeng in men's singles (Class 3) and Liu Jing in women's singles (Class 1-2). China also took golds in rowing's mixed doubles sculls and men's single sculls from Huang Cheng, the world record holder. Great Britain is second in medals with 53.

"(CNN) -- During his trip to northwest Syria in late April, Ole Solvang talked to dozens of people who told him gut-wrenching stories. When the Human Rights Watch interviewer and his colleagues returned home, they titled their report ""They burned my heart: War crimes in Northern Idlib during peace plan negotiations."" ""Those words were chosen because what we saw and heard evidence of were systematic executions and torture -- war crimes -- by the Syrian government forces,"" he said. ""It's been frustrating to record these stories and then hear more negotiating,"" said Solvang, who describes in a video what he saw. ""I think it's clear that there are attempts to undermine the peace plan."" This week, a bomb exploded near a United Nations convoy of workers tasked with monitoring whether a peace plan is working. On Thursday, two car bombs also exploded outside a key government intelligence compound in Damascus. For much of the 14-month uprising, the capital city, home to many al-Assad supporters, has been largely untouched by the violence. Thursday's explosions, which killed more than 50 people, are believed to mark a major point in the conflict. More violence came Friday, according to an opposition group. Five people in Homs and Hama were killed by government forces: Three were shot by snipers, and two were tortured to death, a spokesperson said. The architect of the peace plan, Kofi Annan, the United Nations special envoy to Syria, has said that he is now weighing an invitation to meet with al-Assad. Al-Assad's government faults ""terrorists,"" the term it uses to describe the opposition and rationalize security forces' crackdown. His regime has banned foreign journalists, and several of those who've attempted to report on what's happening in Syria have been injured or killed. Solvang and his team knew the risk they took in entering Syria. They avoided checkpoints and kept a low profile. They visited homes in the province of Idlib and say they hundreds of ruined homes in various towns, many probably from systemic house-by-house arson attacks. Many of the male opposition fighters who once lived in the area's towns have fled, Solvang said. Many women, children and the elderly remain, yet they are being targeted with equal brutality, he said. Several of the 65 witnesses and victims who talked to Human Rights Watch were mothers or wives. They say government forces broke into their homes and executed their families. Three of the victims were children. At 33, Solvang is already an experienced conflict documentarian, interviewing victims of violence in Russia, the North Caucasus and Sri Lanka. He has focused on Syria since the anti-Assad movement exploded in March 2011. But still, he cannot get one mother out of his head. ""She was telling me how the government forces had detained her son and how she had tried to be nice and quiet and cooperative, hoping they would release him,"" Solvang said. ""But as soon as the soldiers left, they told her, 'You have to forget your son.' "" Three days later, the woman found her son's body, riddled with signs of torture, in a village cemetery. ""The courage she had despite (what she went through) and the way she described how she found his body afterward, that made quite a great impact on me,"" he said. Solvang says another mother suffered similarly. The woman recalled how her three sons -- all in their early 20s -- were awakened in the middle of the night by fighters in uniform who identified themselves as ""Bashar's men."" The fighters demanded to know why the sons owned a pants of a style seen worn at demonstrations. The mother desperately tried to explain that the pants were common, that they were the only style available at the town market. The fighters, she said, ransacked the house and forced the sons outside. The mother ran after them, but the ""soldiers pushed me back inside,"" she said. She describes what happened: ""About an hour later, a neighbor came in and said there was a fire nearby, that the army set some cars and a motorcycle on fire, and the neighbors needed more water. My daughters and I went out with buckets, and then my daughters, who were in front, ran to me, saying that my sons were there as well. ""After we extinguished the fire, we found their bodies. Bilal was shot in the middle of his forehead, Yousef behind his ear, and Talal was shot by two bullets, in the head and in the back."" The mother told Human Rights Watch, ""I just wish I were killed and I didn't have to see that."" Several of the victims of summary executions were teenagers; three were children, and several were older than 60, the group documented. Though Solvang has interviewed victims in numerous conflicts, Syria stands out to him because of the estimated tens of thousands of people who rights workers suspect have been unlawfully detained. ""But it's really unclear how many. No one really knows for sure,"" he said. Also unusual is what he says is Syrian authorities' widespread, systematic use of certain torture techniques: Electricity is often used. Syrians have also come up with a name for being hogtied; they call it the ""flying carpet."" Solvang was also struck by people who victims described accompanying their attackers. These people often wear masks and may be locals or people familiar with the victims. One man recalled to Human Rights Watch that while a Syrian official brutalized him, a man with his attacker spouted personal information about him. ""Ask him about his cousin who happens to be a lawyer who is active with the opposition,"" the man said. Another section of the report details the execution of 19 boys and men in the village of Taftanaz on April 3. Human Rights Watch was able to observe bullet marks near several of the alleged killings: all in a row, about 50 to 60 centimeters above the floor, indicating that the victims were probably kneeling when they were shot. Less than a week earlier, in late March, al-Assad announced that he would implement the United Nations peace plan.","Human Rights Watch interviewed Syrians who said families had been executed .

"(CNN) -- Federal investigators have cleared controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio's office of criminal wrongdoing regarding allegations of financial improprieties. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona declined to file charges against the Maricopa County Sheriff's office after an investigation into claims of abuse of county credit cards, misuse of funds and other financial matters. The investigation is separate from a federal civil rights lawsuit accusing Arpaio's office of racial profiling. The federal financial probe stems from a 2010 request from Maricopa County officials for help in investigating the claims of misuse of county funds. Federal authorities acted as ""special deputy county attorneys"" tasked with finding possible state charges. Last year, federal investigators declined to press charges on several of the allegations. In a letter to the Maricopa County officials Friday, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced it will not initiate charges on two remaining claims. ""I am very happy with that,"" Arpaio said at a news conference. Federal investigators ""cleared my office of any abuse of power or wrongdoing that has been going on for years, and publicized almost every week for three years by the news media and critics,"" he said. Arpaio faces civil trial in alleged targeting of Latinos . Arpaio, who calls himself ""America's toughest sheriff,"" has long been a controversial figure for his tough, proactive stance against illegal immigration. But critics say his methods have created a system of racial profiling. The sheriff is on trial stemming from a 2007 class-action lawsuit that alleges that his office ""launched a series of massive so-called 'crime suppression sweeps' that show a law enforcement agency operating well beyond the bounds of the law."" The U.S. Justice Department has also filed a separate civil rights lawsuit against him. But the allegations that were dismissed by the federal investigators were of a smaller scale. One of the allegations was that the sheriff's office misused county credit cards. The feds found that the office was not properly documenting credit card transactions, but found no evidence of stealing county funds. Another allegation was that the sheriff's office used funds earmarked for a program to pay the salaries of officers working on other projects. Investigators concluded that while the funds indeed where shifted from one law enforcement program to another, there was no ""criminal intent."" Critics of Arpaio were displeased with the decision not to press charges, saying the sheriff clearly abused his power. ""It is a miscarriage of justice,"" Pablo Alvarado, director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network said in a statement. Arpaio said that if he had done something wrong, the federal government wouldn't have hesitated to bring indictments. ""I know my people do the right thing, they have a tough job, and because I'm a high-profile guy, sometimes there's more interest given to what we do,"" he said. Who stands with Arpaio?","Federal investigators looked into allegations of financial misconduct .

"Za'atari refugee camp, Jordan (CNN) -- I've spent the past week working in the Za'atari refugee camp in northern Jordan, about six miles from the Syrian border. The camp was opened less than a month ago to receive Syrians fleeing the violence in their country. Built on a barren desert plain without a tree or shrub in sight, it can seem an unwelcoming place to arrive, even for a refugee. Dust storms and scorching heat have taken their toll on refugees and aid workers here. But given that less than 4% of Jordanian land is arable the terrain is not a surprise. Over 20,000 Syrian refugees have moved into Za'atari camp already, and the pace of new arrivals to the camp has more than doubled, with more than 14,000 arriving in the past week alone. Yesterday, we received over 3,000 new arrivals overnight, up from an average of 600 per day just last week. The refugee flow to Jordan has a direct correlation with the situation inside Syria. As fighting has escalated around Syria's southern city of Dara'a, where the uprising began almost 18 months ago, the number of refugees here is increasing dramatically. We are all bracing for a potentially massive influx in the coming days. Yesterday, I met many newly-arrived refugees, some just children, who told me how had they witnessed family members and neighbors being killed in Syria. One 7-year old girl told me she saw her neighbor's throat cut in front of her. Her family fled in the dark of night, walking several hours before they could cross into Jordan. Like every refugee I have met here, they weren't able to bring any belongings -- they came with only the clothes on their backs. Humanitarian aid organizations and UN agencies have been working around the clock to accommodate the sudden increase in new arrivals of refugees, while also working to improve the conditions. But the camp is growing exponentially and it is hard to keep up. I met with camp manager Mahmoud Amoush of the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization yesterday -- he told me, ""We need more of everything."" More tents, improved water systems, more safe spaces and playgrounds for children and psycho-social counseling for children who have been traumatized are all top priorities. I have spoken with many mothers here, and most report that their children have terrible nightmares and are not behaving normally -- either they are being very aggressive and misbehaving, or they are silent and afraid, running and hiding at any loud noise. Wasfeyah, a refugee mother of five children, told me that when her family was trying to escape to Jordan, they were shot at and her eldest son, Ali, was hit in the head by a bullet. The blood from his wound sprayed on his younger brother who is just 6-years old. Ali survived and they made it across the border, but his little brother often wakes up screaming ""there is blood on my shirt."" Wasfeyah doesn't have any money to buy new clothes, so the little boy still wears the blood-stained shirt from that night. Nearly half of the camps' residents are children, and there is next to nothing for children to do here. Providing an outlet for kids who have been through unimaginable, violent events and left everything they know behind is critical to helping them recover and just be kids. We have built one playground and another is almost completed. There are also child-friendly spaces that offer activities to kids. They are hard to miss in the camp -- just follow the unexpected sound of laughter and you will find swarms of kids singing, swinging, sliding and occasionally arguing over who's turn it is. More playgrounds and child-friendly spaces are being planned as the camp population grows. Improvements to the camp continue despite the massive amount of work going into accommodating new arrivals. The quality of the food has been a major complaint from many refugees in the camps. Currently, they receive hot, pre-cooked meals that are distributed throughout the camp, but now communal kitchens are being built so families can cook for themselves. Electricity is now installed in 40 per cent of the camp, making life a bit easier. Charging mobile phones seems to be the primary use so far, based on what I have seen in the tents I visit. Dust and sand storms are one of the greatest challenges of living in the camps. It is not just a discomfort, but it has become a health issue and camp doctors report that they are seeing many cases of respiratory problems, especially in infants and small children, due to the dust. Many days it is hard to see more than a few meters in front of you in the camp, as the air is thick with sand and debris that is carried by the strong winds that blow through the barren camp. One mother told me, ""not even a camel could live in this place, it is so hot and dusty."" The camp has been bringing in tons of gravel that is being spread on the ground to help alleviate the problem. Water is one of the most pressing long-term issue that faces the refugees, as well as the local Jordanian communities. Jordan has inadequate fresh water supplies for its own population, and the refugee community is putting increased demands on an already short supply. Water is currently being trucked into the camps from local wells in the community, but Mercy Corps will be drilling a new well and developing a water system with other organizations that will serve the camp, and alleviate the need to take scarce water from the host community. The work ahead, to provide all the desperately needed services for the refugees is daunting, but it is under way. Each day I am in the camp I see progress being made, even as we struggle to meet the pressing needs of all the new arrivals. No one knows how long the camp will be here and when the Syrian refugees will be able to go home. Many anticipate it will be a long haul, but all of us, especially the Syrians here, are hopeful they can return soon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cassandra Nelson.","Za'atari refugee camp in northern Jordan is home to more than 20,000 Syrian refugees .
Hundreds more arrive every day, on foot, with just the clothes they are wearing .

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- As you probably heard, Julian Castro's keynote speech to the Democratic National Convention was historic. It marked the first time that a Latino had ever delivered the signature address at that event, and the fact that the 37-year-old mayor of San Antonio was invited to do so by the Democratic Party -- and his twin brother, Texas state Rep. and congressional candidate Joaquin Castro, was chosen to introduce him -- was a show of respect for America's largest minority. As we Latinos might say: ""Ya era tiempo"" -- ""It was about time."" A majority of Latinos have voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election dating back to 1960. That's 13 elections, loyally casting votes for strong candidates and weak ones. Over the last half-century, a lot of Democrats have owed their political careers to voters with names such as Gutierrez, Rodriguez or Morales. Opinion: What Julian Castro can do for Obama . The speech itself had its golden nuggets -- most of them revolving around family, culture, community. It also had its lead trinkets -- policy talk about ""investing"" in creating opportunity that Republicans will dismiss as more tax-and-spend rhetoric that was a poor fit for someone being marketed as a leader of the future. The gold sounded like this: . ""My grandmother spent her whole life working as a maid, a cook and a babysitter, barely scraping by, but still working hard to give my mother, her only child, a chance in life, so that my mother could give my brother and me an even better one. ... And I can still remember her, every morning as Joaquin and I walked out the door to school, making the sign of the cross behind us, saying, 'Que dios los bendiga.' 'May God bless you. ..."" And this: ""My grandmother never owned a house. She cleaned other people's houses so she could afford to rent her own. But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college. And my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone. ""And while she may be proud of me tonight, I've got to tell you, Mom, I'm even more proud of you. Thank you, Mom. Today, my beautiful wife, Erica, and I are the proud parents of a 3-year-old little girl, Carina Victoria, named after my grandmother. A couple of Mondays ago was her first day of pre-K. As we dropped her off, we walked out of the classroom, and I found myself whispering to her, as was once whispered to me, 'Que dios te bendiga.' May God bless you. ..."" But given what had transpired outside the Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte a few hours earlier, Castro's speech was also bittersweet. Ten people who identified themselves as illegal immigrants, part of a national caravan dubbed the ""Undocubus,"" were arrested outside the arena for blocking an intersection and refusing to disperse. They were there to protest President Barack Obama's immigration policies. And because the Obama administration's signature immigration enforcement program, Secure Communities, requires local police to submit to federal authorities the fingerprints of arrestees whom they suspect might be in the country illegally, those 10 people could be deported. They have names such as Estevez, Carrasco, Castellanos, Diaz, Sanchez and Torres. There is no question that Castro did Obama an enormous favor Tuesday night by inspiring and energizing Latino voters, a majority of whom tell pollsters that they like the president personally but disapprove of his immigration policies -- most notably, a record number of deportations now approaching 1.5 million. For Latinos, those deportations represent more than numbers on a spreadsheet. They represent hundreds of thousands of families that have been torn apart and divided across a border, and thousands of U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants placed in foster care. Obama broke the first rule of dealing with Latinos: Don't mess with the family. Although the latest polls show Obama leading Mitt Romney by more than a 2-to-1 margin with Latinos, the president has developed an enthusiasm gap with those voters. And there are really two ways for Obama to ""lose"" the Latino vote -- if 40% of Latinos vote for Romney, or if a large chunk of Obama voters are so unenthusiastic about his record in office that they just stay home. The first probably won't happen. The second just might. A new Zogby poll found more than 14% of Latino voters are undecided about whom to vote for. Recently, Obama announced a new policy at the Department of Homeland Security where illegal immigrants who meet certain qualifications -- less than 31 years of age, no criminal record, came to the United States before the age of 16, etc. -- can apply for two years of ""deferred action"" so they're not deported. But not everyone is eligible, and many are too skeptical to participate. Hence, the protest. The good news for the Obama campaign is that Latinos will not soon forget the emotional words Castro delivered Tuesday night. The bad news is they won't forget the president's dreadful immigration record, which made the speech so necessary. And that's the bittersweet part. Inside the arena, Latinos heard a beautiful story that reminded us how far we've come. Outside the arena, we witnessed an ugly reality that tells us how far we still have to go. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro's speech inspired, energized Latinos .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon defended his government's approach to combating crime and drugs Monday during his final state of the nation address. More than 47,500 people have died in drug-related violence in Mexico since December 2006, when Calderon took office and announced plans to deploy troops to combat cartels. He steps down in December. ""What's clear ... is that we've made advances Mexicans should feel proud of,"" the president said, adding that it may take years for his government's efforts to come to full flower. ""Mexico has started along the path toward a life full of liberty and security."" Calderon, who spoke at the National Palace, voiced support for the role of government troops in the drug war. Critics contend too many officials have ties to the cartels, are corrupt and are doing as much to help the traffickers as to stop them. Alleged drug cartel figure extradited . Mexican authorities recently accused four top military officials, including a former deputy defense secretary, of connections with organized crime in what could be one of the highest-profile corruption cases in recent history. Though Calderon admitted mistakes have been made, he said such abuses are the exception, not the rule, and described the military as the nation's first line of defense. As he has in the past, he criticized the United States for providing criminals with almost ""unlimited access"" to weapons. The president also hailed progress made on the economic front during his administration. Roughly 2 million jobs were created, he said, stressing that security and growth go hand in hand. He highlighted investments made in infrastructure, particularly along rural roads. Calderon, who belongs to the right-wing National Action Party, will be replaced by Enrique Pena Nieto, a member of the rival Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Candidate refuses to accept results . Some political opponents of Pena Nieto, whose party governed Mexico for more than 70 years until 2000, have warned that negotiating with drug cartels and gangs could be on his agenda -- an accusation that Pena Nieto has repeatedly denied. Calderon urged the next government to continue the fight against organized crime. Pena Nieto has pledged to focus more on reducing violence and less on catching cartel leaders and blocking drugs from reaching the United States. He has called for a ""new debate"" on the drug war, in which the United States would play a significant part. Pena Nieto will be sworn into office on December 1.

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton on Thursday became the first U.S. secretary of state to visit East Timor since the developing Southeast Asian nation gained full independence from Indonesia 10 years ago. Clinton arrived in the capital, Dili, on Thursday morning for meetings with President Taur Matan Ruak and Prime Minister Kay Rala Xanana Gusmao. Her schedule made it impossible for her to watch a live broadcast of the speech by her husband, Bill Clinton, at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday night. As she toured a coffee cooperative in Dili, a project manager showing her around remarked that Clinton's husband had ""a big job today."" ""He does,"" Clinton said. ""He's probably doing it as we speak."" She will have to watch her husband's speech on playback later, an aide traveling with her said. Clinton is visiting a nation still working to find its feet. East Timor celebrated its 10th birthday as an independent nation in May, but it still suffers bouts of political violence and faces stiff economic challenges to alleviate high poverty rates. The country ranks 147th out of 187 countries in the United Nations' most recent Human Development Index, which rates countries on life expectancy, education and income. Clinton is expected to announce funding for scholarships for students from East Timor to study in the United States, a senior State Department official said. A day earlier, Clinton held talks with a string of Chinese officials in Beijing but appeared to gain little traction on the sensitive issue of the competing maritime claims of China and its neighbors in the region. After receiving a hostile welcome in editorials and articles in the Chinese news media when she arrived Tuesday, Clinton also had to contend with the abrupt cancellation of her planned meeting with Vice President Xi Jinping, who is expected to become the next Chinese president. Beijing attributed the decision to unspecified scheduling reasons. China talks tough in Japan island dispute . After meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on Wednesday, Clinton repeated the U.S. position on the territorial disputes between China and other countries in the South China Sea, urging those involved to ""begin to engage in a diplomatic process toward the shared goal of a code of conduct."" Tensions over territorial disputes have spiked this year between China and a string of countries around its coastline -- from Vietnam in the south to Japan in the northeast -- and the United States has been drawn into the fray. But Beijing, which prefers to tackle the disputes bilaterally, has reacted angrily to Washington's involvement in the matter, accusing the U.S. State Department of ""unfounded accusations"" and showing a ""total disregard of facts."" At the joint news conference with Clinton on Wednesday, Yang took a more diplomatic tack, saying that ""freedom of navigation and safety in the South China Sea is assured."" But even while Clinton was in Beijing, the Chinese government was maintaining a heated diplomatic back-and-forth on another territorial controversy, this one concerning a set of small islands in the East China Sea also claimed by Japan and Taiwan. The uninhabited islands are known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu, and are privately owned by a Japanese family. Interactive: Asia's disputed islands - who claims what? Some Japanese media outlets reported Wednesday that the Japanese government had agreed to buy the islands from the family, a claim the government's chief Cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, declined to confirm, saying talks on the matter were continuing. But that was enough to prompt a stern response from Hong Lei, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman. ""I want to emphasize again that any unilateral actions taken by the Japanese regarding the Diaoyu Islands are illegal and invalid,"" he said. ""We are closely monitoring the developments and will take necessary measures to defend our territorial sovereignty,"" Hong added. Furious anti-Japan protests erupted across China last month when a Japanese group sailed to one of the disputed islets and symbolically waved Japanese flags. China doesn't seem eager for the United States to get involved in the quarrel. The Global Times, a Chinese newspaper affiliated with the ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial published Tuesday that Clinton's diplomacy in the region ""has fomented frictions between China and some surrounding countries."" It called on her to ""reflect upon the deep harm she is bringing to the Sino-U.S. relationship."" More: Islands dispute reopens old wounds .

"(CNN) -- Maria de Villota has become the first female to be involved in Formula One for 20 years after joining Russian team Marussia as a test driver. De Villota, the daughter of Spain's former F1 driver Emilio de Villota, is the first woman to be part of the elite motorsport since Italy's Giovanni Amati entered three grands prix for Brabham in 1992. The 32-year-old will work alongside Marussia's newly-formed driver line-up of German Timo Glock and French rookie Charles Pic, and will be given time behind the wheel during the 2012 season. ""I am very happy to be joining the Marussia test driver program,"" De Villota, who has competed in the World Touring Car Championship, told the team's official website. Pit-lane pioneers: Women in Formula One . ""This is a fantastic opportunity to work closely with a Formula One team and gain important experience to help me progress my career, including the chance to drive the new car later in the year at the Abu Dhabi test. ""I will be joining the team trackside so I'm looking forward to working alongside them at the first race next weekend, and this can only help my future ambition to step up to Formula One racing."" Team principal John Booth welcomed De Villota to the Britain-based team, which competed as Virgin in 2010 and 2011. ""We are pleased to welcome Maria to our test driver program, which will enable her to be integrated into a Formula One team environment and gain a vast amount of experience that will be useful to her career progression,"" he said. ""We will also provide Maria with the opportunity to sample F1 machinery later in the year, further adding to her racing credentials."" De Villota is only the sixth woman to be involved in the elite division of motorsport, the first being Italy's Maria Teresa de Filippis -- who raced in three grands prix for Maserati in 1958. The best finish achieved by a woman in F1 was in 1975 when De Filippis' compatriot Lella Lombardi scored half a point for placing sixth in a shortened Spanish Grand Prix. British driver Divina Galica entered three races for both the Surtees and Hesketh teams between 1976 and 1978, but failed to qualify. She told CNN last year that De Villota's biggest challenge would be handling the media attention and withstanding the physical demands of F1. ""My concern for her is not that she would be an ambassador, which she would be, and I'm sure she would do a wonderful job,"" Galica said. ""But when she actually gets in the car I'm wondering if she'll be fit enough. ""I would be in the gym trying to lift heavy weights and get my neck muscles going and just make sure I'm strong enough. I don't know her, but I think that would be my advice."" American Danica Patrick attracted huge interest last month by becoming only the second woman to win pole position for a race on the NASCAR circuit. Patrick is the most successful woman in the history of open-wheel racing, after becoming the first female to win an IndyCar series event and coming third in the Indianapolis 500 in 2009.","Spaniard Maria de Villota joins Marussia as a test driver .

"Slidell, Louisiana (CNN) -- Authorities dropped a mandatory evacuation order Sunday for neighborhoods threatened by a strained lock on a southeast Louisiana canal, but still recommended people stay away. ""As there is still a potential threat, even though reduced, a voluntary evacuation remains in place until the Army Corps of Engineers deems the lock stable and safe,"" the president and sheriff of St. Tammany Parish announced late Sunday morning. ""Please stay vigilant."" The lock authorities feared would fail was on a man-made canal that juts off the Pearl River, near the Mississippi state line. The river has been swollen by rain from last week's Hurricane Isaac, forcing authorities to relieve pressure on the structure by releasing water Saturday and Sunday. Earlier Sunday, St. Tammany Parish President Pat Brister told CNN the water level at the lock has been reduced ""tremendously"" since Saturday night, and ""We feel a lot better."" But the waters were still rising Sunday afternoon. Christina Garcia stopped by a boat ramp around the corner from her home periodically, counting off heel-to-toe steps from the waterline to the top to track the river's rise. ""When I first started, it was like, 14, and now I'm down to probably 10,"" Garcia said. The river ""is starting to come up slowly, but there is some concern. We are trying to take all precautions."" Forecasters predict the Pearl River will crest Monday at 19.5 feet, more than five feet above flood stage. That will result in ""major flooding"" of at least two subdivisions near the banks and threaten areas in the southeastern corner of the parish, according to the National Weather Service. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano visited the parish on Sunday, during a trip that also included stops in Mississippi where she met with that state's governor and other officials. President Barack Obama will be in Louisiana on Monday for a briefing with local officials and to tour flood-damaged areas in St. John the Baptist parish. What's left of Isaac, meanwhile, soaked in and around the Ohio River valley on Sunday, bringing stormy weather from Nashville, Tennessee, to Indianapolis. The storm's remnants have brought much-needed rain to parts of the lower Midwest. But the system skirted most of the Midwestern and Plains states where this year's drought -- which the National Climatic Data Center reported last month was affecting a majority of the U.S. mainland, the most since 1956 -- has been most devastating. ""Certainly, it helped some locations in our far eastern counties in Oklahoma, but there was very little beneficial rain,"" said Pete Snyder, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Tulsa. Nearly all of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas fall under the worst two drought categories. Isaac dumped heavy rain across southern Arkansas last week, with some flooding reported around Little Rock and Pine Bluff. But the northwestern city of Fayetteville, which is nearly 11 inches below its normal rainfall totals for the year, got just over an inch, Snyder said. Flood warnings remained posted for parts of two northeastern Arkansas counties along the Cache River on Sunday. Parts of Missouri and Illinois saw up to six inches of rain Saturday, and the National Weather Service issued a flood warning Sunday for parts of southern Illinois. Isaac is blamed for at least 19 deaths in Haiti and at least four more in Louisiana and Mississippi after making landfall last week as a Category 1 hurricane -- on the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina -- near the mouth of the Mississippi River. The storm posed the first real test to New Orleans following a $14.5 billion federal effort to reconstruct the city's flood control system after it failed during Katrina in 2005. Katrina killed nearly 1,800 people, most when the storm overwhelmed the levee system and flooded the city. Though much weaker than Katrina when it came ashore, Isaac moved slowly and dumped enormous amounts of rain on Louisiana and Missouri. In Plaquemines Parish, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, homes and businesses flooded after a parish-maintained back levee failed. Officials were intentionally breaching levees in strategic areas in the parish, in hopes of getting ""the bulk of this water out in five to seven days,"" Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said Saturday. Hundreds of thousands in the region were without power early Sunday, including at least 320,000 Entergy Louisiana customers, officials said . Residents began returning home over the weekend in Helena, Mississippi, where National Guard troops rescued hundreds trapped by rising waters brought on by Isaac. Annie Judge returned home Saturday to find more than four feet of water inside her home. ""Clothes, my laptop, a bunch of baby stuff, pictures,"" all ruined, she told CNN affiliate WLOX. ""All the furniture is ruined."" CNN's Greg Botelho, Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- With Republicans gathering in Tampa, Florida, for their party's convention, here are a few facts about the Grand Old Party's party: . Convention timing . • 2012 marks the fifth time that the two major party conventions have been held on back-to-back weeks. This also happened in 1912, 1916, 1956, and most recently in 2008. Early convention milestones . • The first Democratic convention was held in Baltimore in 1832. Twenty-two of the 23 states sent delegates as President Andrew Jackson was nominated for a second term. • The first Republican convention was held in Philadelphia in 1856. Nearly 600 delegates participated, representing all of the Northern states, the border states of Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Virginia (as well as D.C.). There were no delegates from the Southern slave states. 8 ways faith will matter at the Republican National Convention . • At its 1832 convention, the Democratic Party established the now famous tradition of the presidential roll call vote, passing a resolution requiring that ""the majority of the delegates from each state designate the person by whom the votes for that state shall be given."" • The Democrats issued their first party platform at their 1840 convention (also in Baltimore). The platform contained fewer than 1,000 words. Noteworthy GOP convention speeches . • In 1992, Pat Buchanan declared, ""There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself."" The speech rallied conservatives, but is widely assumed to have alienated moderates. • At the 1960 Republican convention in Chicago, Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater proclaimed, ""Let's grow up, conservatives. If we want to take this party back, and I think we can some day, let's go to work."" Four years later, Goldwater captured the Republican nomination. A few memorable convention moments . • In 1952, Gen. Douglas MacArthur became the first war hero to deliver a major party's keynote address. MacArthur biographer William Manchester writes that the ""delegates were babbling so much among themselves that the general could scarcely be heard."" Notable Republican convention fights . • In 1976, an early indication of President Gerald Ford's eventual victory over challenger Ronald Reagan came when the Reagan forces narrowly lost a vote that would have forced Ford to name his running mate before the presidential roll call vote. • In 1952, Illinois Sen. Everett Dirksen caused an uproar when, during his speech, he charged New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey and other moderates with taking the GOP ""down the path to defeat."" Dewey's (and Dwight Eisenhower's) followers booed Dirksen, Dirksen's (and Sen. Robert Taft's) supporters booed Dewey, and fist fights broke out on the floor. The convention ultimately nominated Eisenhower over the more conservative Taft after a dispute over several contested Southern delegations was settled in favor of Eisenhower. John King: Convention goal is changing voters' view of Romney . • In 1932, a proposed platform plank calling for the repeal of Prohibition was defeated by a vote of 690- 460. • In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was nominated on the third ballot, surprising supporters of New York Sen. William H. Seward, who had entered the convention expecting an easy victory on the first ballot. The convention delegates were influenced by a large number of Lincoln supporters, who packed the convention hall after receiving counterfeit tickets from Lincoln's campaign workers.

"(CNN) -- Anyone can turn on a TV, scan their newsfeeds or fire up a laptop to get a sense of the important topics being discussed at the Democratic National Convention. This article is not about those important topics. This is for those other moments -- the ones that make us SMH or LOL or unfollow certain people on Twitter. These are the moments that prompt us to show our phones to the person next to us, eyes wide with disbelief and mischief. It's not news. 1. Tweet love . Twitter enthusiastically embraced the first night of the Democratic National Convention, with #DNC2012 tweets surpassing 2.1 million before first lady Michelle Obama even stepped onstage. The total number of #GOP2012 tweets topped 4 million over the course of that convention, according to figures provided by Twitter. The first lady's speech drove more tweets per minute than any Republican National Convention speaker, including presidential candidate Mitt Romney -- 28,003 to 14,289. Nearly every person who had a visible role Tuesday night trended on Twitter at some point, from San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland to Michelle Obama's brother, Craig Robinson, and Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth, who has been locked in an ugly race for a U.S. House seat in Illinois. Twitter user @tbogg put it like this, ""Tammy Duckworth lost her legs while piloting a Black Hawk helicopter in Iraq. Paul Ryan once drove the Weinermobile. #DNC"" 2. #sexyface . Kal Penn, better known for his ""Harold & Kumar"" movies than his role at the White House, gave the only response of the night to Clint Eastwood's #emptychair when he thanked the ""invisible man in the chair"" for giving the order to take out Osama bin Laden and ""who's cool with all of us getting gay-married."" He also encouraged viewers to get out and vote, even if they had to do so ""without their pants on."" Finally, he wondered aloud what his trending hashtag would be at the conclusion of his speech and humbly suggested, #sexyface. Twitter happily obliged. Until the Bieblers caught wind of it. 3. Cute kids . The adorable 2-year-old Zoe Lihn and her family brought the convention to tears when they shared their personal story about Zoe's congenital heart defect and insurance coverage struggles. Under the Affordable Care Act, mom Stacey Lihn says they no longer have to worry about coverage for Zoe's third surgery. ""If Mitt Romney becomes president she will hit her lifetime cap and may not receive her heart transplant,"" Stacey Lihn told the crowd as her two girls and their father stood close by. As mom was speaking, a child started crying. Zoe's big sis Emerson though seemed to love the stage and the applause. @allisonrose711 tweeted, ""Okay, so yeah.

"(CNN) -- The mere rumor of a downgrade by the major ratings agencies is enough to send world markets into a tailspin, wiping billions off the values of global stocks. So what do ratings agencies do, and why are they so important? Who are the credit ratings agencies? The ""Big Three"" are Standard's & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings. All originated in the United States, although Fitch has dual headquarters in New York and London. What do they do? Before you can get a credit card, banks run a credit check on you. Similarly, the ratings agencies run credit checks on companies, countries and financial products. Countries are rated on a sliding scale: Germany for example, has a top rating (AAA) which allows it to borrow cash at cheap interest rates. The lower the rating grade, however, the higher interest payments a nation must pay to attract investors to buy its bonds. Anything that slips to junk status -- as Ireland, Portugal and Greek government bonds are rated -- is considered a ""highly speculative"" investment. Furthermore, the pool of eligible investors is reduced -- many institutional investors, such as government pension funds, are forbidden to invest in junk-rated bonds. Why do they wield such power? Investors across the world look to credit rating agencies to judge where to place their bets in the market. For governments, the ratings agencies have a lot of power over the popularity of bonds: cash given to governments by investors that, over time, will pay a return on the original investment -- unless the government defaults. What does a debt rating downgrade mean? The decisions of the ""Big Three"" catalyze market moves in often unpredictable ways, creating a strong ripple effect. In the wake of the Greece downgrade last year, for example, investors across the globe started rethinking investment in other governments' bonds and began selling off more risky investments -- throwing the EU into crisis and depressing the value of the euro. When the U.S. was downgraded from a top rating to a step below best investment grade last August, the market reaction was fierce. At the start of August, the Dow was trading at 12,000; by August 10, days after the downgrade, the Dow dipped below 10,800. There was a similar psychological ripple through the markets after Moody's downgrades of Ireland and Portugal. How are ratings agencies paid? Historically, they were created to give investors an unbiased assessment of investments and investors paid for access to the ratings. In the 1970s, however, credit rating agencies started charging the issuers of new investments fees for ratings. In 1975, U.S. legislators -- fearing a proliferation of unscrupulous ratings agencies -- designated Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch as the only ratings organizations banks and brokers could use to evaluate the credit worthiness of their products. What are the complaints against the firms? Critics complain the agencies have lost their ability to independently judge the risk on certain investments. Credit ratings agencies had a starring role in the financial crisis, after the firms blessed mortgage-backed securities with AAA ratings -- the safest rating possible -- and fed the global mania for these risky investments. Critics also note that the agencies are paid by the very entities they rate, raising questions about their trustworthiness. There are moves afoot in Europe to have more stringent regulation on credit ratings agencies. And the agencies were dealt a blow in a U.S. court last month when a U.S. District Judge James Browning in Albuquerque, New Mexico, rejected ""free speech"" as an argument in a case against the Big Three credit ratings agencies brought by investors who lost investment in mortgage-backed securities. The ratings agencies often invoke First Amendment right regarding questions about their ratings -- they are simply stating an opinion. It's up to the markets to decide for themselves what to do with that information.","Ratings agency S&P warned in December that 15 eurozone nations may face possible downgrade .

"(CNN) -- A Belgian military bomb squad investigated a suspicious vehicle outside the United States Embassy in Brussels, Belgium, on Wednesday, but found ""nothing abnormal,"" officials said. The building was ""evacuated this afternoon as a precaution while Belgian authorities investigated a suspicious vehicle in the vicinity,"" the embassy said on Twitter. The incident began when a police officer noticed that the car did not have the official plate required for parking by the diplomatic mission. The officer checked and found something suspicious in the car, Brussels police spokeswoman Ilse Van de Keere said. She refused to say what prompted the officer's concern. Police later said they saw wires coming from the car, but there was ""nothing abnormal to report."" Technicians are continuing to investigate the vehicle, and police are trying to determine who owns it and how it came to be parked near the embassy, they said. The incident came just over a month after a fake bomb attached to a vehicle as part of a terrorism drill by the U.S. Embassy in Oslo, Norway, triggered a security alert at that embassy. The U.S. Embassy had a rehearsal for a terrorism incident in mid-July, spokeswoman Siv Alsen of Norway's Police Security Service said. They ""used fake bombs, and one of those bombs was not removed"" from the vehicle it was attached to, sparking the July 31 alert, Alsen said. CNN's Alanne Orjoux, Andrew Carey and Jo Shelley contributed to this report.","A suspicious vehicle prompts the Belgian Defense Ministry to send a bomb squad .

"(CNN) -- Police in Montreal were working Wednesday to uncover the motive behind a gunman's midnight attack that left one person dead and another wounded at the victory rally by Quebec's newly elected premier. Pauline Marois was speaking to excited supporters near midnight Tuesday when the man, dressed in what appeared to be a bathrobe and face mask and armed with two guns, slipped into the Montreal concert hall and opened fire. He then set a small fire at the venue's back door, police said. Amid the chaos, Marois' security team hustled her off stage. She was not injured, but one person died and another was wounded, according to police. Minutes later, the 63-year-old returned to thank her supporters and asked the crowd to calmly leave the room. Police said Wednesday they were trying to determine whether Marois was the intended target of the gunman, who was arrested moments after the attack. Authorities took the 62-year-old suspect to the hospital after his arrest for what police described as an ailment that did not appear to be serious. Police would not release the suspect's name until he appears in court, they said, which is not likely before Thursday afternoon. Authorities also have not yet released the identity of the dead shooting victim, saying family members may not yet have been notified. The second shooting victim suffered non-life threatening injuries, according to Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere. While it's not clear what the motive for the attack may have been, the man shouted ""The English are waking up!"" in French as he was being taken to a police cruiser. Marois' party, Parti Quebecois, wants the French-speaking province to secede from Canada and become its own country. Marois and her party defeated the incumbent Liberal party in the elections, unseating longtime premier Jean Charest and making her the province's first female leader. ""As a result of this tragedy, it is all the Quebecois who are grieving today in the face of such a senseless act of violence,"" Marois said in a statement released by the party. She said elections, not violence, should guide Quebec's future. Marois said she saw little of the incident that prompted her security detail to whisk her off the stage and was not aware one shooting victim had died until later. She downplayed suggestions that the campaign had anything to do with the incident. ""I don't think there is a relation between the events of yesterday and the style of our campaign,"" she said. Quebec voters first elected a separatist government in 1976, and since that time the province has quarreled with the English-speaking majority in the rest of Canada over its position in the country. Quebec voters have twice rejected referendums supporting sovereignty for the province, the last time in a closely contested 1995 vote, said Antonia Maioni, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. The issue seemed to fade following that loss and the 2003 election of Charest as premier, and was not the central issue in the election that vaulted Marois to power, Maioni said. ""Sovereignty played (a role), but I wouldn't say it was the ballot box issue in this election,"" Maioni said. While Marois talked up the issue with the party faithful, she pitched to the broader electorate with a message of change and a platform calling for expanded economic programs and government financial reforms, Maioni said. During her victory speech, Marois called for unity and told English-speaking Quebec residents that their rights would be respected, CBC reported. ""We share the same history, and I want us to shape together our future,"" she said in English. CNN's Paula Newton contributed to this report.","NEW: Pauline Marois says she doesn't think the shooting and campaign were linked .

"(CNN) -- For the sorcerers who practice the dark arts of politics, the hot summer months are generally known for their focus on triviality, hyperbole and petty posturing. This ""silly season"" is marked mostly by frivolous debates over manufactured controversies as voters tune out and cook out in parks and backyards across the country. So it comes as no surprise that the latest bit of feigned outrage to embroil the United States Department of Agriculture involves an interoffice newsletter recommending that employees consider taking a modest stab at common sense. Joining the ranks of thousands of companies, restaurants, schools, average Americans and Oprah, a recent newsletter from the USDA made a humble suggestion for its employees to reduce their environmental footprints: Consider eating a meat-free lunch once per week. The agency was referring to ""Meatless Monday,"" a project of Johns Hopkins, Columbia and Syracuse universities and supported by many other health-related organizations. After angry press releases from the meat industry and outraged tweets from Republicans in Congress, a USDA spokeswoman announced the agency does not endorse the ""Meatless Monday"" initiative and said the suggestion was posted on the agency's website ""without proper clearance."" Problem solved, I guess. But the rationale behind an idea like ""Meatless Monday"" is crystal clear. It's exactly the kind of step USDA should be endorsing. The reality is that it takes massive amounts of land, water, fertilizer, oil and other resources to produce meat, significantly more than it requires to grow other nutritious and delicious kinds of food. Because meat production is so resource intensive, livestock farming actually accounts for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cattle farming alone consumes nearly 8% of global human water use. My own organization, Oxfam, an international relief and development organization, recently endorsed the idea of eating less meat and dairy as part of our GROW campaign to fight global hunger. We did a study and found that if a family of four decided to swap burgers or other beef for lentils just one meal a week, they could save about 12Â½ Olympic-size swimming pools of fresh water over the course of a year. If that seems like an astronomically large amount of water for such a small change, it's because it is. Meatless Mondays might seem like an unlikely cause for a humanitarian organization to champion. But Oxfam is working on this issue because as diets around the world change and the population swells to 9 billion over the coming decades, our planet will need to produce up to 70% more food even as we use fewer resources. If we don't reduce our environmental footprints as we increase production, poor people, particularly women, will be the first to suffer. Eating less meat is a simple way to reduce the pressure on global resources and help ensure that everyone has enough to eat. To say it simply, eating less meat helps fight hunger. The meat industry would argue that eating less meat would damage the bottom line of American farmers. But farmers are already struggling just to keep up with the spiking global demand for meat, which experts predict could nearly double by 2050. Eating less meat could help slow this unsustainable increase, but U.S. farms won't suffer as a result. Swapping out meat just once per week would also help reduce the emissions that are contributing to climate change and extreme weather. Farmers across the United States are facing the worst drought in a generation, leading the USDA to declare 1,369 counties in 31 states as disaster areas. The weather has caused massive crop failures, driving a significant spike in the price of corn. While it may be hard to know exactly what role climate change has played in causing the drought, there is no doubt that these kinds of events are exactly what we expect to experience more frequently and with greater severity because of the changing climate. Our study looked at what would happen if urban and suburban households in just four countries -- the United States, United Kingdom, Spain and Brazil -- decided to swap beef for lentils just once a week. We found that the emissions reductions from this tiny step alone would be the equivalent of taking 3.7 million cars off the road for a year. Sadly, facts like these are not enough to avoid the silly season altogether, or to persuade the USDA to ignore the self-serving indignation of the meat industry and keep a reasonable suggestion on its site. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Grossman-Cohen.","USDA's newsletter suggesting employees forgo meat once a week causes uproar .

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- As thousands of Democrats gather in Charlotte this week for their party's convention, hope and change need to make room for humility and contrition. There is a lot to be humble and contrite about. Like George H.W. Bush in 1992, President Obama seems to be out of ideas. By any measure, this is a failed presidency. And Obama has compounded that failure by continuing to blame his predecessor for the situation he inherited, in a ploy that is well beyond the expiration date. The economy continues to be weak. Gas prices are high. Consumer confidence is low. Many people are afraid of losing their job, their home and their life savings. We worry about the present, and we worry even more about our children's future. Campaign promises were broken. A president who vowed to bring Americans together has driven us further apart with divisive rhetoric that fuels class warfare. Meanwhile, Obama's foreign policy successes -- i.e., the killing of Osama bin Laden by Navy Seals -- have been offset by the president's indecisiveness in dealing with Iran and Syria. And this administration has not been as good a friend to Israel, or as respectful to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as it should have been. One of the biggest mistakes that Obama made in the last three and a half years was not taking better care of his base and adhering to the principles he espoused when running for the presidency. He has disappointed many parts of the coalition that helped elect him. After eight years of George W. Bush, liberals and progressives thought they would get their concerns alleviated by Obama. Instead, when Obama began to embrace some of Bush's policies, some of his supporters ended up with new concerns. Many on the left have registered their disappointments. Civil libertarians winced when Obama emulated George W. Bush's blueprint for fighting the war on terror, everything from suspending habeas corpus for terror suspects to domestic wiretaps to keeping open the military prison at Guantanamo Bay. Latinos are heartsick over the fact that Obama deported more than 1.5 million illegal immigrants (most of them from Latin America) and broke up hundreds of thousands of families. Teachers unions were upset when Obama adopted the high-stakes testing accountability model that formed the basis of ""No Child Left Behind"" and rebranded it as ""Race to the Top."" And gays and lesbians would have likely preferred someone who helped lead the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act over someone who merely announced that he had come around to personally supporting gay marriage. Polls show that many Americans still like President Obama as a person. In August, a USA Today/Gallup poll showed that voters found Obama more likable than Mitt Romney by a staggering 23 points, 54 percent to 31 percent. But few seem to trust his abilities. The same poll found that Romney got the better of Obama when voters were asked who they thought was better able to fix the economy, 52 percent to 43 percent. Will disillusioned Democrats and independents who feel hoodwinked show up to vote for Obama in November? That's the question. As usual, former Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich is sure that he has the answer. Gingrich told conservative radio talk show host Sean Hannity: ""Obama won't be defeated by those who are angry with him. He'll be defeated by those who are disappointed in him."" That sounds right. And that is what this week is all about, inspiring the base to vote and cobbling together the same winning coalition that helped elect Obama in 2008. At this convention, there will be no need for Greek columns or Messianic rhetoric. Democrats can't re-capture lightning in a bottle. But Obama might be able to persuade just enough voters to take a chance again, and that would be good enough. To do it, he has to reconnect with everyday Americans by: . -- Showing that he ""gets"" it, and that he is ready to do something different in his second term than what he did in his first one, . -- Accepting responsibility for his failures, admitting his mistakes and showing that he has learned from both, . -- Uniting, inspiring and motivating the Democratic base to turn out and vote despite his center-right drift on a host of issues, . -- Showing empathy for those who are suffering and giving them hope that things will improve. Last week, in Tampa, Romney needed to zero in on those who thought Obama had failed as president, but who were not yet sold on the idea of him as a replacement. He did some of that. This week, in Charlotte, Obama needs to speak to those who don't like the alternative but still think he has come up short and needs to do better. We'll see if he can do that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","The Democratic National Convention is held in Charlotte, North Carolina, this week .
Ruben Navarrette: Hope and change need to make room for humility and contrition .

"(CNN) -- Every year, thousands of families gather in school gymnasiums and auditoriums across the country to enter a drawing, one they believe will make the difference between success and struggle. These lotteries are how charter schools decide who their students will be; the experience can be quite dramatic. As each name is revealed, many winning families can't help but cry out, relieved that they've beaten the odds, convinced that great things are now in store for them. But just a few feet away from these joyful celebrations, there are tears. Students -- some still in kindergarten -- sob with their parents as they realize their hopes have been dashed. These gut-wrenching scenes play out in ""Waiting for 'Superman'"" and ""The Lottery,"" two new documentaries that put a harsh spotlight on America's public education system and have sparked nationwide debate on what education solutions are needed. ""I don't even go to lotteries anymore because they break my heart,"" Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker said in ""The Lottery."" ""A child's destiny should not be determined on the pull of a draw."" But destiny is exactly what many parents believe is at stake. Frustrated with failing public schools in their neighborhoods, they've turned to a charter school that they hope will dramatically improve their child's chances for success. Space in these schools is limited, however, and by federal law, lotteries decide who gets in. ""The Lottery,"" directed by Madeleine Sackler, follows four elementary-age children from low-income neighborhoods in New York. Their parents have applied for Harlem Success Academy, a highly regarded charter school where ""about 95 percent of the kids are at grade level,"" Sackler said in an interview with CNN. ""In Harlem overall ... it's 56 percent."" ""Waiting for 'Superman,' "" directed by Davis Guggenheim, takes a national approach, following children applying for charter schools in New York, California and Washington. Both films reach the same consensus: The U.S. public education system is antiquated and needs to be revamped. ""By getting to know these children -- and the mothers and fathers who are fighting for them -- then maybe people will be outraged enough to demand real change in their own neighborhoods,"" said Guggenheim, who also directed the Academy Award-winning documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth."" ""The idea of education reform becomes a lot less abstract and a lot more compelling when you see these beautiful kids and realize all their potential."" Both ""The Lottery"" and ""Superman"" use successful charter schools to illustrate that all children can learn as long as they're in the right environment. Charter schools are similar to public schools in that they are free to attend and funded by taxpayer dollars. But unlike public schools, they are not bound to the rules and regulations of a district, state or teachers union. They are free to set their own guidelines for curriculum, teacher evaluations and lengths of school days. In return for this autonomy, the schools must live up to a contract, or charter, signed with the governing authority in their state. If the schools fail to reach required goals set in the charter, which are usually three to five years in length, they can be closed down. Charter school proponents say increased accountability -- as well as the freedom to innovate -- gives them an edge over traditional public schools. Since 1991, 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have signed legislation that allows charter schools. While ""The Lottery"" and ""Superman"" celebrate charter schools and hold up their leaders as shining examples of positive reform, the films are highly critical of politically powerful teachers unions, saying their unwillingness to change is largely responsible for hindering progress in America's public education system. Both films detail how difficult it is to fire a tenured teacher for poor performance. ""The Lottery"" said that of 55,000 tenured teachers in New York, 10 were fired in 2007. The cost to do so? About $250,000 each. ""The system is really built for the harmony amongst adults,"" Guggenheim told CNN. ""That means that the teachers unions, the central bureaucracies and the administrators, they've got job security, and everything is working just fine. We need to reorient our schools so that they serve the kids."" Randi Weingarten, president of one of the country's two largest teachers unions, appeared in both films and said they aren't without merit. ""They connect us to real-life struggles. They may even call much-needed attention to the challenges confronting many students and schools,"" said Weingarten, who leads the American Federation of Teachers. ""But the attention will be misplaced if it centers on off-base solutions and denigrating good teachers rather than on what works to improve our schools."" Weingarten thinks ""Superman,"" in particular, was ""inaccurate, inconsistent and incomplete"" despite its ""unquestionably good intentions."" ""There also are countless good, great and exceptional teachers working in our public schools every day in neighborhoods across the country -- although for this film, they apparently ended up on the cutting-room floor,"" she said. Weingarten also said the film's charter school success stories are not representative of charter schools as a whole: ""Guggenheim makes only glancing reference to the poor achievement of most charter schools, despite the abundance of independent research showing that most charter schools perform worse than or only about as well as comparable regular public schools."" One report, released last year by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University, looked at 70 percent of the nation's charter school students and compared their progress with similar students in nearby public schools. It found that 17 percent of charter schools reported progress significantly better than public schools, 46 percent showed no difference, and 37 percent performed worse. Whatever the answer to America's education troubles, Guggenheim said, his ultimate goal is to get people talking and motivate them to take action. The film's website offers detailed instructions of how people can make a difference on a local level -- from writing public officials to volunteering at schools in their own communities. ""The option of just sticking your head in the sand, praying for some Superman to come in and save your schools, it ain't going to work,"" he said.","Two films, ""The Lottery"" and ""Waiting for 'Superman,' "" take on the U.S. education system .
Both highlight successful charter schools and lengths families go to enroll .

"(CNN) -- Call it what you will -- providence, fate or simply a stroke of incredibly good luck -- Colorado shooting victim Petra Anderson has some of it. Anderson, 22, sustained multiple gunshot wounds in the movie theater rampage last week. Three shotgun pellets hit her arm, and one went through her nose into her brain. The head injury could have been fatal, but thanks in part to a brain abnormality she never knew she had, Anderson is on her way to a full recovery, according to her pastor. He said there's just one way to describe what happened: ""a miracle."" Remembering the victims . ""The doctor explains that Petra's brain has had from birth a small 'defect' in it. It is a tiny channel of fluid running through her skull, like a tiny vein through marble, or a small hole in an oak board, winding from front to rear,"" Brad Strait, senior pastor at Cherry Creek Presbyterian Church in Englewood, Colorado, wrote on his blog this week. ""Like a marble through a small tube, the defect channels the bullet from Petra's nose through her brain. It turns slightly several times, and comes to rest at the rear of her brain. And in the process, the bullet misses all the vital areas of the brain. In many ways, it almost misses the brain itself,"" he said. ""In Christianity we call it prevenient grace: God working ahead of time for a particular event in the future. It's just like the God I follow to plan the route of a bullet through a brain long before Batman ever rises. Twenty-two years before,"" Strait wrote. Anderson was one of 58 people wounded when a gunman opened fire early Friday inside a screening of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" at a theater in Aurora, Colorado. Twelve people were killed. Gun background checks in Colorado spike after shooting . Andrew Roblyer, a friend of Anderson's family, stopped short of describing the condition as a defect. As a neurosurgeon explained to the family, channels or ""voids"" like hers are not uncommon, but the placement of them is random and can vary, he said. The 22-year-old was moved out of the intensive care unit Monday. She has started physical and speech therapy and is able to walk, talk and laugh, according to Roblyer. ""She's herself in a lot of ways,"" he said. Anderson is a gifted musician and composer. She spent last summer studying composition at the Bowdoin International Music Festival and is an alumna of the prestigious Interlochen Center for the Arts camp. Stories of survival from the victims . She also studied music composition at the University of the Pacific, Conservatory of Music, and was named the 2011 Presser Scholar, a national award for outstanding music students. She graduated this year. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who is a neurosurgeon, recalled a case where someone had what looked to be a significant bullet injury to the brain, but the person also had an arachnoid cyst, or a fluid-filled sac. That condition likely saved the patient's life and may have been what happened with Anderson, Gupta said. But, he added, there are several conditions that could help explain her case. Anderson's pastor, Strait, described a moment at the hospital when Anderson woke up. She opened her eyes, sat up and asked for her mom, he wrote. Surviving with the guilt of living . Anderson's mother, Kim, is also sick. She found out recently that the breast cancer she thought was gone is back and has spread to her liver, bones and lungs, according to a website set up to help raise funds for their family. Anderson is not completely out of the woods either. She needs more surgeries and could, perhaps, undergo facial reconstruction. Still, for now, family members are thankful for the support they have received so far and focused on the moment. ""We are all in amazement at what happened,"" said Roblyer, the family friend.

"(CNN)  -- Forget World Cups. For many rugby union players the ultimate accomplishment is being selected to appear for the famed British Lions on their overseas tours. Giant Munster lock Paul O'Connell is leading the 2009 Lions in South Africa. The Lions are comprised of the best players from the four home unions of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland and competition for places in the squad is fierce as club and country loyalties are put aside. In the modern professional era, Lions tours take place every four years, visiting the southern-hemisphere Tri-Nations powers of New Zealand, South Africa and Australia in rotation. A typical tour will see a series of matches against provincial or regional sides, interspersed with international or Test matches. Midweek fixtures are normally against weaker teams, with the Lions giving all their squad members a chance to play, with stronger opposition for the weekend matches which would include the Tests. The 2009 Lions are touring world champions South Africa, looking to improve on the dismal performance of the 2005 side, which visited New Zealand. Under England's 2003 World Cup winning coach Clive Woodward, the 2005 squad were expected to prosper, but slipped to defeat in all three Test matches against the All Blacks. The team was captained by Brian O'Driscoll, but his tour ended after just two minutes of the first Test when he was controversially 'spear' tackled by Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu and dislocated his shoulder. O'Driscoll, who led Ireland to the Six Nations Grand Slam this year, was expected to captain the Lions to South Africa, but coach Ian McGeechan gave the job to Munster lock Paul O'Connell. McGeechan has already gone into Lions history, playing on the 1974 and 1977 tours, and coaching winning teams to Australia and South Africa in 1989 and 1997. He also took them to New Zealand in 1993 where the Test series was lost 2-1. The Lions enjoyed their most successful period in the early 1970s with the 1971 team -- inspired by the Welsh half-back pairing of Gareth Edwards and Barry John -- triumphing against the All Blacks in New Zealand. The 1974 Lions were arguably the best-known and most successful of all time, winning three Tests and drawing one in South Africa and going through the tour unbeaten. Under Irish captain Willie John McBride, their uncompromising forward play set up the victories, with their now infamous catch phrase ""get your retaliation in first"" leading to brutal early exchanges in most games. The modern era is a far cry from the first Lions tour back in 1888 which visited Australia and New Zealand with just 21 players from England, Scotland and Wales. They played provincial and local sides without formal Test matches. But it had established a precedent, and the 1891 side was sanctioned by the sport's ruling body the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and played three Tests against South Africa. The 1924 tour to South Africa was the first trip when the term ""the Lions"" became common currency and it has grown from strength to strength since, despite the growing influence of international rugby competitions such as the Tri and Six Nations and the World Cup.","British and Irish Lions are selected from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland .

"(CNN) -- Michael Phelps repeated his record breaking feat of winning three straight Olympic gold medals in the same event with a gutsy victory in the men's 100m butterfly Friday. It was the 17th gold medal of his remarkable career, the 21st overall, and his final swim in an individual race before retiring after the London Games. Phelps had won the 200m Individual Medley Thursday night to create Games history for a male swimmer for successive Olympic victories and was not to be denied in the sprint butterfly. The American superstar was only seventh at the turn but powered past the field to win in 51.21 seconds. South African Chad le Clos, who had pipped him to gold in the 200m butterfly, and Russian Evgeny Korotyshkin shared silver, both clocking 51.44. ""I am just happy that the last one was a win. It's very special,"" Phelps told BBC Sport. He will round off his efforts in the medley relay final Saturday where the U.S. are favored to win. It was to prove another superb night for Phelps' teammates with 15-year-old Katie Ledecky upsetting home favorite and defending champion Rebecca Adlington in the 800m freestyle final. Ledecky led from the first length at the London Aquatics Centre to come within half a second of breaking Adlington's world record set in her 2008 Beijing triumph. She touched in eight minutes 14.63 seconds ahead of Mireia Belmonte Garcia of Spain in silver with Adlington in bronze. Britain's main hope for a swimming gold also took bronze in the 400m free. Ledecky said she received a good luck message from Phelps before the final. ""Michael is the first Olympian I ever met before I started swimming at the U.S. Nationals in 2002 or 2003 in Maryland, so to get a good luck before the race really calmed me down and I was ready to swim my race,"" she said. Adlington tried to swallow her disappointment with a defiant message. ""Everyone expected me to get a gold medal. I am so proud. I have been in four Olympic finals and got four medals, so that's nothing to be ashamed of, but I was disappointed with the time,"" she told BBC. The third gold of the penultimate night of finals for the U.S. came from teenage sensation Missy Franklin in the women's 200m backstroke. It was the 17-year-old's third gold of the Games and she did it in style with a world record of two minutes 4.06 seconds to have clear water between herself and second placed Anastasia Zueva of Russia. Franklin's teammate Elizabeth Beisel took the bronze. ""It feels absolutely amazing, I can't think of a better way to end my individual events,"" Franklin said. Frenchman Florent Manaudou prevented a U.S. clean sweep of gold with a shock win in the men's 50m freestyle. Manaudou, 21, the younger brother of former Olympic women's 400m freestyle champion Laure, hit the took victory in 21.34 seconds.

"(CNN) -- The United States is experiencing its biggest spike in West Nile virus since 2004, with 241 cases of the disease reported nationwide this year so far, including four deaths, health officials said. Of the 42 states that have reported infections in people, birds or mosquitoes, 80% of them have been in Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the CDC said in a statement.  The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also listed a breakdown of infections by state. ""It is not clear why we are seeing more activity than in recent years,"" said Marc Fischer, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. ""Regardless of the reasons for the increase, people should be aware of the West Nile virus activity in their area and take action to protect themselves and their family."" The virus is transmitted through infected mosquitoes. In the United States, most infections occur between June and September, and peak in August, according to the CDC. Symptoms include fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash, the CDC said in a statement this week. ""Less than 1% develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the brain or surrounding tissues),"" it said. People over age 50 and those with conditions such as cancer, diabetes and kidney disease or with organ transplants are at greater risk. There are no medications to treat West Nile virus or vaccines to prevent infection. People with milder illnesses typically recover on their own but those more seriously affected may need hospital care. Health experts say prevention measures include avoiding mosquito bites, using insect repellent and getting rid of insect breeding sites.

"(CNN) -- A plane performing at an air show in Davenport, Iowa, crashed and exploded in front of thousands of spectators. The pilot of the plane was killed in the accident Saturday afternoon when the plane nosedived into an alfalfa field during the Quad City Air Show, officials said. The pilot, who died on impact, was not immediately identified by authorities. The plane, a high performance L-39 Albatross jet trainer, was attempting a 45-degree bank when it crashed, Assistant Police Chief Don Schaeffer told CNN affiliate WQAD. The pilot was a member of the Hopper Flight, a group of exhibition fliers, Schaeffer said. A home video taken by a spectator showed what appeared to be three airplanes flying in formation when one appeared to experience a problem. Seconds later, the plane hit the ground and exploded in a giant fireball.

The crash is under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety, officials said. The air show was temporarily halted after the crash, with ""Taps"" being sounded as aircraft flew in formation over the crowd. The crash occurred just days after federal investigators released their findings behind the cause of a crash last September at the National Championship Air Races in Reno, Nevada, that killed a pilot and 10 spectators. More than 60 others were injured in the crash.

They discovered a warrant for his arrest for failure to appear on a previous misdemeanor charge and took him into custody, police said. The incident caused extra concern because of the July shooting at a Colorado movie theater in which suspect James Holmes, with his hair dyed various shades of orange, identified himself to police as the Joker. The shooting happened at the premiere of the latest Batman movie and left 12 people dead. Melbourne police said a caller first reported the man at 10:34 a.m. Wednesday, saying he was pacing back and forth in front of and then inside the theater. Police said they found Sides as he was exiting the theater. They said he made no threats while he was there and cooperated while being arrested.","Man's face painted like the Joker from the Batman movies .

"(CNN) -- Family musical groups are as common as cowboy boots at the Grand Ole Opry. The Band Perry joins a long list that includes the Jackson 5, the Bee Gees, the Pointer Sisters, even the Von Trapp Family Singers. Still, fans have an endless fascination with how these groups operate in such close quarters, perhaps because so many of us have memories of bickering with our own siblings over Tonka trucks and dress-up bins. ""We've had to go against nature a bit,"" Kimberly Perry admitted with a laugh. ""But honestly, I'm not sure how people do it without their family."" The three siblings -- Kimberly, Neil and Reid -- have been performing together for 14 years. The band is a democracy, they said, but their mom holds two votes and plays referee.It's a system that has worked wonders so far. In October 2010, the group released ""If I Die Young,"" a single that, ironically, given the title, brought The Band Perry to life. The song reached No. 1 on the country charts, headed over to the pop charts and went quadruple platinum after selling more than 4 million copies. Since then they've released three more hits -- ""You Lie,"" ""All Your Life"" and the latest, ""Postcard from Paris.""""The most nerve-racking moment was releasing 'You Lie,'"" Kimberly said of the band's success since the first single. ""It was like, 'Great, we're not a one-hit wonder band.'"" In 2011 the band won both the American Country Music and the Country Music Association's new artist of the year awards, as well as the 2011 CMA award for single of the year. This summer they're traveling with Brad Paisley on his ""Virtual Reality"" tour and promoting the Outnumber Hunger program, an initiative aimed at providing meals for food banks across the country. The siblings are from a small town, Greeneville, Tennessee, that was badly damaged by the tornadoes that hit the South last April. ""So many of the families were struggling financially anyway, the food bank really helped them get back on their feet,"" Kimberly said. ""So this [program] is really near and dear to our hearts."" Kimberly, 28, is the talker of the group. Reid, 23, and Neil, 21, speak only when they can get a word in edgewise. They're songwriters, first and foremost. ""We write in a writing circle,"" Neil said. ""Reid's on the base guitar, I'm on my mandolin... it's like there's a pot in the middle and we're all throwing stuff in."" Touring with Paisley can be tricky. He's known to be a prankster -- spraying opening acts with water, throwing bread rolls on stage and even decorating Jerrod Niemann's tour bus. ""We do have to sleep with one eye open when we're out on the road,"" Kimberly said. So far it has been only psychological warfare: Paisley peppered a concert venue in Kentucky with a photo of the band, using a head shot of Christopher Guest to replace Reid. But the band is ready for anything. They've stashed Nerf guns and silly string in cases on stage. Paisley parties are actually becoming more legendary than his pranks, Reid said. Paisley brought a petting zoo with miniature ponies to one show. He recently rented a theater for a private viewing of ""Avengers."" ""He's a great guy to be out on the road with,"" Kimberly said. ""It's a grueling schedule and he's one of the best at keeping it lighthearted."" The Band Perry is headed back to the studio to record their second album. Faced with pressure to duplicate the success of their first, the Perrys are trying to remember that they've been doing this for years -- and will continue to play after the spotlights fade.","The Band Perry has four hits, including ""If I Die Young"" and ""Postcard from Paris""

"(CNN) -- The coming elections seem to have fired up an intergenerational war, with the older population cast as the ""greedy geezers"" eating so much of the pie that they leave only crumbs for the younger generation. Both Republicans and Democrats say that entitlements must be cut. The main losers of these cuts will be Americans older than 65 who collect Social Security and cash in Medicare checks. At the same time, both parties agree that we must spend more on the education of the young if we are to remain competitive in the world markets. Taking from the old is justified on the grounds that they take more out of Social Security than they paid in, while the young, who pay for Social Security, will find that the program has gone belly-up by the time they retire. Well-heeled older people are said to be enjoying the good life while the young can't find jobs and are saddled with debt. Charles Lane, writing in the Washington Post, makes the point with numbers. He cites a report from Pew Charitable Trusts that says the median net worth of households headed by those 65 or older rose between 1984 and 2009 by more than $170,000. At the same time, that of households headed by those 35 or younger shrank by 68%, to less than $4,000. Sixty percent of seniors find it easy to pay their bills and the same percentage expect their quality of their life to improve in the near future. Others use rather strong emotive terms. Stephen Marche, writing for Esquire, refers to a ""bleeding up of the national wealth"" to the elderly from today's disenfranchised youth. The Minnesota Daily editorial board asserts that ""while no parent would honestly sell out their children, the U.S has done just that."" Dale Brandy, writing in the American Thinker, defines Social Security in terms of a class struggle between the ""young 'have-nots'...against the power, wealth, and influence of the older 'haves.' "" Health care expert Karl Stockton writes that the ""elderly receive the lion's share (of health benefits) while breaking the backs of the young."" It makes the elderly sound like the 1% that 99% of the young should rail against. These hostile statements ignore some elementary and some surprising facts. Social Security comes close to paying for itself, after some recent revisions. The way to curb Medicare, which after all is merely a big reimbursement machine, is to cut the costs of health care rather than leave old people to chose between medications and their meals. Most important, it should surprise no one that people who completed the work years have earned and saved more than those who are just beginning to work or are early in their work career. And elementary fairness says that people who worked all their lives and saved a considerable share of their earnings rather than spent it all, should be allowed to live out their remaining years in reasonable comfort. CNN Money: Senior victims lose average of $140,500 to financial abuse . Utterly ignored in all these tirades against the old, is the notion that the elderly get much more than young is based merely on public budgets and pays no mind to what happens to the large mountains of private dough. The data leave not the slightest doubt that our seniors, far from spending it all on a big going-out party during their retired years -- which they surely are entitled to and could do -- give trillions of dollars to the young in gifts. A study conducted by John J. Havens and Paul G. Schervish of the Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College predicts that between 1998 and 2052,  a minimum of $41 trillion will pass from one generation to the next. They estimate that more than half of these funds will be transferred through bequests to heirs, about a quarter will go to estate taxes and fees, and the rest will be given to charities. There seems to be no statistics about the billions grandparents spend, while still living, on their grandchild's first car, first house, college tuition, and such, but looking around me I find these amounts seem to vastly exceed what grandchildren grant their old folks. There is always room for reallocating our public budgets, such as cutting the hundreds of billions we are spending in Afghanistan and employing them in nation building at home, or stopping corporate welfare. We may even have to cap entitlements. But the last thing we need is another heated confrontation and a new line of social division. Instead, children and grandchildren should draft thank you notes to their elders for saving so much and leaving trillions behind. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Amitai Etzioni: The idea is growing that the old get all the benefits while young suffer .

"(CNN) -- Stacy Peterson disappeared five years ago, but the suspicions and fears she harbored about her husband haunted his murder trial and proved crucial in his conviction. Her words came to life through two crucial witnesses who conveyed Stacy's remarks to jurors. That's hearsay evidence, or what one person tells another outside a courtroom setting. The allowance of that evidence could possibly form the basis of an appeal by attorneys for former suburban Chicago police Sgt. Drew Peterson, 56, who was found guilty Thursday of the 2004 killing of ex-wife Kathleen Savio. Stacy Peterson's words and her husband's conviction could also mean that he could face a new murder trial -- this time for the death of Stacy herself. ""Stacy, you are now next for justice,"" Savio's brother Nick Savio said after the verdict was read. Savio was Peterson's third wife; Stacy, his fourth. Stacy vanished in October 2007, but her body has never been found. She left three children behind at home, and her family believes she was killed. But before Peterson can be charged again, prosecutors would have to prove that Stacy is dead and then that she was murdered. ""The longer someone is gone, the easier it is to prove they haven't just run away and that they are deceased,"" said James Glasgow, the prosecutor in Will County, southwest of Chicago. ""October 28, 2007, is in our rearview mirror now,"" he said. ""We are going to look at that case and assess it as it stands today, and if we feel confident in going forward, we will be doing so."" Peterson once fueled outrage in the media with his brash behavior and flippant remarks about his wife's disappearance. But Thursday, he sat stone-faced in court as the verdict was read and returned to his jail cell as a murderer with little public sympathy. His case, however, could live on in the court system for years. Critical moments from the Drew Peterson trial . ""You know what they say, a conviction is a first step in a successful appeal,"" said Joel Brodsky, Peterson's lawyer. ""Believe me, there's several world-class appellate lawyers just waiting to get their teeth into this."" An appeal could be based on a number of issues, including potential prosecutorial misconduct. But at the heart of the Peterson trial controversy is the court's allowance of Stacy Peterson's disturbing comments, which jurors said were ""extremely critical"" to reaching the guilty verdict. Jurors heard what she had said through the testimony of two key witnesses: the Rev. Neil Schori, Stacy Peterson's pastor, and Harry Smith, Savio's former divorce lawyer. Schori testified that Stacy told him she woke up in the middle of the night -- the same night that Savio was killed -- and noticed her husband was not in bed. ""After that, it was some time later, in the early morning hours,"" Schori said. ""She saw him standing near the washer and dryer, dressed in all black, carrying a bag. She said that he removed his clothing, and then took the contents of the bag and put all of that into the washing machine."" Schori said Stacy told him that Drew told her he had killed Savio and then coached her to lie to police about it. And she did, Schori said. Juror Teresa Mathews said Friday that the jury was troubled that police interviewed Stacy while Drew was present. Smith testified that Stacy planned to divorce Drew and wanted to know if ""the fact that he killed Kathy could be used against him"" as leverage. Just days after that phone call with Smith, Stacy disappeared. Her statements would be struck down in most courts of law: In 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that hearsay violates a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness testifying against him or her. But Illinois passed a special law in 2008 that allows such hearsay evidence in rare instances when prosecutors believe a person was killed to prevent his or her testimony. The law quickly became known as ""Drew's law."" Defense attorneys argued that it was unconstitutional. They said it unfairly targeted Drew Peterson because it was passed after the case had already made national headlines. ""He is absolutely innocent,"" Brodsky said of Peterson after Thursday's verdict, adding that his client was convicted ""based almost entirely on hearsay."" Kelly Saindon, a former prosecutor in Chicago who attended parts of the Peterson trial, said the hearsay evidence was key. ""That was exactly the turning point when the prosecution hit their stride,"" she told HLN. ""Stacy's voice came in, and everyone knew she was gone and that Drew Peterson was a murderer. ""You could see it on the jury's face,"" she said. Savio was found dead in her bathtub on March 1, 2004. Her hair was wet, but the tub was clean and dry. Savio's killing did not garner much publicity until Stacy Peterson went missing and investigators began looking again into the circumstances. They exhumed Savio's body, re-examined it and issued a second report on her death. Savio, it said, was murdered. Peterson was arrested and charged in May 2009 with first-degree murder. His lawyers argued her death was accidental -- that she fell, hit her head and drowned. But jurors said Friday that they believed doctors who testified otherwise; that Savio's injuries were not consistent with a bathroom mishap. Jurors never saw any physical evidence connecting Peterson to Savio's death. Nor was there testimony placing him at the crime scene. But they heard what Stacy said. The jury of seven men and five women deliberated for nearly 14 hours before reaching their verdict. When the panel adjourned for the night Wednesday, the jury was 11-1 in favor of a guilty verdict, juror Ron Supalo told reporters. He was the holdout and said it was Schori and Smith's testimony about what Stacy had said that finally swayed him. ""The hearsay evidence was big,"" he told CNN affiliate WLS-TV. ""It seemed all the evidence was pointing toward the defendant being guilty."" Jury foreman Eduardo Saldana said Friday the testimony of Schori and Smith played a big part in the jurors' decision. Schori said he was ""hugely honored to be able to give Stacy a voice."" ""The jury did the right thing,"" he said. ""And justice is coming for Stacy's family, too. It's going to happen."" Peterson was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Cales, who eventually became his fourth wife. Savio and Peterson filed for divorce in October 2001. Their relationship was contentious in the years following, and a legal battle ensued over the division of common property. A court was about to make a ruling in which Savio was expected to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. But Savio died before the decision. Peterson is set to be sentenced in late November. Illinois no longer has the death penalty. Peterson faces a maximum of 60 years in prison.

"London (CNN) -- Whether or not we witness a ""Grexit"" from the Euro 2012 football on Friday night, it is surely a delicious irony that Greece and Germany are squared up. I stopped in at my local toy store Friday morning, where a Greek flag has been waving proudly above the door all week. According to the owner, it's not if Greece wins or loses this game, it's how Greece wins or loses. Pride and dignity need to be at the fore, in other words. I think this has been true through the entire euro crisis. You cannot help but see that some Greeks feel humiliated by the whole process. Many Greeks tell me they know the pain is necessary, but not this way. Truth is, I think both sides in the Greece versus Germany drama are correct when it comes to how we got here. Greece did not modernize their economy while other countries did -- there are far too many state employees at far too many state-run firms. Frankly, it's hard to see how politicians could have done that in Greece given its legacy. Leadership failed in Greece and the people let it happen. Greece's economic turmoil hits team . On the other side, the Greeks (and the Spanish and Irish) splurged on a decade of cheap credit and low interest rates. Part of that party money was spent on buying German-made goods and on money loaned by German banks looking for growth outside their natural borders. The fuel was easily on offer and everyone soaked it up. So, the crisis is not just the fault of the Greeks, the Irish, the Spanish and so on. They were allowed to get away with it for far too long. A common problem needs a common solution. Yes, Europe moves painfully slowly and yes, they only seem to make major decisions when the crisis flares up. But at least they do make those decisions. Euro 2012 in pictures . I suspect we are on the cusp on a new round of decisions. They may benefit the Spanish and Italians more than others, given how important those economies are to the eurozone. My hope is that Greece falls off the radar of the markets and media again, for a number of months, while they get on with the painful restructuring. But it also needs to be done without humiliating the Greeks. They will certainly play with pride on Friday night.","CNN's Jim Boulden notes the delicious irony of Greece and Germany facing off on the pitch .

"(CNN) -- The wife of Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. detailed to a Chicago newspaper her husband's ""collapse"" and his last two months getting treated for gastrointestinal and mental health issues, saying he's still ""very depressed"" though showing some progress. Sandi Jackson, an alderwoman in Chicago, talked with the Chicago Sun-Times shortly after returning from visiting her husband at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, with their two children. ""What I can tell you is my husband has his good days and bad days, and they are increasing his depression medication to therapeutic levels,"" Sandi Jackson told the paper. The Illinois Democrat and son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, has not been on Capitol Hill since late May. In early July, the congressman's office announced he was ""receiving intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder."" Then, a few weeks later, his office issued another statement via the Mayo Clinic indicating that he was undergoing an ""extensive inpatient evaluation for depression and gastrointestinal issues"" at the prestigious medical facility. Besides such statements, Jackson and his family have been largely mum about his ordeal. His father did tell the Huffington Post, in a taped interview, that about ""seven or eight weeks ago"" he went to visit his son in Washington and learned he hadn't slept in three days. ""We went to the hospital, and they kept him,"" the Rev. Jackson told the online news website. ""And what we thought to be 'exhaustion' was something much deeper, much broader, and it lasted much longer."" Sandi Jackson elaborated on what happened to the Sun-Times' Michael Sneed, calling the congressman's ""collapse"" on June 10 at the family's Washington residence as ""D-Day for us."" By then, she said, her husband was ""completely debilitated by depression."" Beating back rumors, Sandi Jackson denied firmly that her husband had attempted suicide or was receiving help for alcohol or drug addiction. She also said the indictment of his friend, Raghuveer Nayak, had no bearing since it happened June 20, after the family imposed a ""news blackout"" on Jesse Jackson Jr. as he got treatment. Medical experts are still weighing whether a recent weight-loss surgery might have helped trigger his depression, his wife said. With Sandi Jackson at the family's other home in Chicago, the congressman's father and brother Yusef took him to a Washington hospital in early June. Some time later, Yusef Jackson brought his brother -- at Sandi Jackson's suggestion, she said -- to the Sierra Tucson Treatment Center in Arizona because that facility specializes in mental health. Eventually, it was decided to transfer him to the Mayo Clinic. ""Jesse is now gaining weight and eating and feeling better in that sense, but he is still very depressed,"" Sandi Jackson said of his current condition, adding that he has his ""ups and downs."" ""But I am encouraged by the number of tests they are running and the quality of the analysis."" She said there's no timetable on when he might return to work -- including whether he'll be back at work by Labor Day and perhaps at the Democratic National Convention in early September -- adding ""it's up to the doctors ... but we should know soon."" Jackson's illness comes as the House Ethics Committee is examining allegations that in 2008 he or or one of his associates offered to raise funds for then-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in exchange for Jackson being appointed to the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama after he was elected president. The congressman has maintained his innocence and pledged to continue to cooperate with authorities. Blagojevich was convicted last year on corruption charges in connection with his efforts to profit from appointing the successor to the Senate seat. He began serving a 14-year sentence in March. In a separate incident, Jackson apologized to his constituents in September 2010 after the Chicago Sun-Times reported a Chicago businessman told federal investigators that Jackson had asked him to pay for a restaurant hostess to fly between Washington and Chicago several times. He said he was ""deeply sorry"" that he had disappointed some supporters.","Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. hasn't been at work on Capitol Hill since May .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Attorney's Office said it is not confirming or denying reports that Jared Loughner will plead guilty in last year's shooting rampage outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket. The attack killed six people and wounded 13 others, including then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. On Saturday night, the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal reported that Loughner, 23, is now mentally competent to understand the charges against him and that a status hearing on his competency, scheduled for Tuesday morning, will now be a change-of-plea hearing. The Los Angeles Times attributed the information to ""knowledgeable sources,"" while the Wall Street Journal said its source was an ""official familiar with the case."" ""I can neither confirm or deny the reports in the L.A. Times and other media about the Loughner case,"" Bill Solomon, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona, told CNN when asked about the reports late Saturday night. Asked if his office planned to issue a comment Monday, Solomon said, there was ""nothing planned at this time."" The attack took place during a January 8, 2011, meet-and-greet event for Giffords. Among those killed was Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll. Giffords, who was shot in the head, stepped down from her position in Congress in January 2012 in order to focus on her recovery. Ron Barber, an aide also wounded in the attack, now holds the seat. Loughner was facing the possibility of a death sentence if convicted. However, a plea deal -- if one is in the works -- may mean that he would admit guilt in exchange for a lengthy prison sentence. Prosecutors have said that Loughner, who spent time on suicide watch, suffers from schizophrenia. His mental condition has been central to much of the related court proceedings since the mass shooting. In February, a federal judge ruled Loughner could receive medical treatment for another four months. A psychologist found ""measurable progress"" in the suspect's condition. The medical treatment plan for Loughner was aimed at improving his mental state so he will be competent to stand trial. Loughner was declared incompetent to stand trial in May 2011 after an initial evaluation term at a federal mental hospital in Springfield, Missouri. In July 2011, bizarre and suicidal actions by Loughner while in custody pushed a federal appeals panel to allow authorities to force the defendant to take anti-psychotic medication. Prosecutors said then that Loughner had been deteriorating: He displayed screaming and crying fits that lasted hours, harmed himself and made claims that the radio was inserting thoughts into his head. His attorneys consistently fought court rulings that Loughner continue his treatment at the hospital. In November, defense attorney Ellis Johnston argued before a different federal judge that the side effects of the psychotropic drugs his client had been receiving during his court-ordered treatment may interfere with Loughner's ability to work with his attorneys. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Christina Cabanillas said that Loughner ""could revert to being a danger to himself"" if the medication were halted. Court documents released a few days after the shooting showed that investigators found a letter from Giffords in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents, thanking him for attending a 2007 event. ""Also recovered in the safe was an envelope with handwriting on the envelope stating 'I planned ahead,' and 'my assassination' and the name 'Giffords,' along with what appears to be Loughner's signature,"" the affidavit stated. CNN's Shawn Nottingham and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","The reports say a competency hearing will now be a change-of-plea hearing .

"(CNN) -- Now the Democrats are stepping into the spotlight. With the Republicans packed up from their stormy convention in Tampa, Florida, and back on the campaign trail, the Democrats gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to explain to Americans why their candidate is a better choice in November. Like Republicans, Democrats must use this high-visibility media opportunity to outline their arguments for the fall. Although President Barack Obama is more of a known commodity than GOP candidate Mitt Romney after three and a half years in the White House, there is still a lot of work for Democrats to do in the coming days. Outside of his strong favorability ratings, polls continue to show that Obama is extremely vulnerable as a result of the slow economic recovery. With so much of the workforce struggling with unemployment and unstable jobs, Romney has a fighting chance. Many Americans are unhappy with what the Democrats have offered. They don't feel that they are better off in 2012 than they were in 2008. At their convention, Democrats need to lay out a series of arguments if they are to strengthen their chances of victory. Obama's personal popularity is not enough under these conditions. Democrats must offer a straightforward, ringing defense of what their president has been able to accomplish. Opinion: Can Obama convince voters to turn to him again? With Republicans talking about failed leadership, Democrats must seek to show this is not the case. Too often, Democrats have been on the defensive, explaining away the shortcomings of Obama's legislative legacy or blaming congressional Republicans for the fate of his initiatives. Obama has sometimes been reluctant to tell his side of the story, often responding to Republican criticism rather than laying out his understanding of what has happened. If Democrats are to do well, the president will have to do more than blame President George W. Bush or congressional Republicans, or just warn about what a Romney-Ryan White House would do. For example, Obama could do more to explain how his economic stimulus played an important role in stabilizing economic conditions and investing funds in important programs that will shape the nation's future. In his new book, ""The New New Deal"", Time correspondent Michael Grunwald argues that the stimulus created over 2 million jobs, prevented a more dire economic collapse, and resulted in billions of dollars being spent on clean energy projects (with the failure of the solar energy company Solyndra really being atypical), information technology projects (such as rationalizing health care billing), education programs, and more. Obama must also make a stronger case about what his health care bill will achieve -- such as allowing people under 26 to retain health insurance under their parents' coverage and preventing companies from denying benefits to those with pre-existing conditions. He will need to connect his programs to a broader economic strategy, explaining how programs like health care -- which the administration argues will lower overall deficits and lower the cost of premiums for individuals and business -- will be important to a robust economic future. In general, Americans like government when they are asked about specific policies but don't like government in the abstract. For Obama, the lesson is that the more he talks about his record with specifics, the better he will do. Democrats must also offer a bolder defense of government as a necessity for strong economic growth. Democrats continue to be hesitant and reluctant to mount a defense of government. Still seeing themselves as living in the Ronald Reagan era, they try to rebut the charge that they are anti-market. Opinion: Young voters, don't give up on Obama . In his keynote address to the Republican convention, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie argued that ""Our ideas are right for America and their ideas have failed America."" Democrats will need to respond. Recently, Obama sloppily tried to explain how governments have been essential to businesses, but said this in a way that opened him up to attack for being anti-business, leading to the GOP mantra of ""I built this!"" In a fascinating new book entitled ""To Promote the General Welfare: The Case for Big Government,"" a group of historians shows how important government has been in almost every area of American life, from our information networks, to our schools, to our transportation, to our homes. In a chapter about housing, the historian Tom Sugrue writes that ""federal housing policies remade the whole landscape of America. Most important, they made possible the rapid expansion of suburbia."" Without a strong government, private markets can't thrive. The two go hand in hand. The point is not to say that business people are not responsible for their success, but, rather, that the best business people need a strong foundation on which to build their projects. One can't run a successful store if police don't protect the shop from thieves, if roads are not built and paved so that customers can reach their destination, if tax incentives are not in place to alleviate some of the costs that the owner must shoulder. The last argument that Democrats, and especially President Obama, must make is that he has not given up on his vision of changing the way that politics works. When Obama ran in 2008, Americans were excited about the possibility of a politician who would transcend the old politics and devote political capital to fixing a broken process. But in Mitt Romney's acceptance speech, the Republican candidate asked, ""If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama?"" Obama must respond. His promise was not just one of bipartisanship, but a promise to look seriously at the flaws in our political system. Unfortunately, Obama abandoned many of those goals. Even worse, as a result of both parties walking away from the public finance system that came out of the Watergate scandal, and a series of court decisions, the 2012 campaign has turned into an orgy of campaign contributors, on both sides of the aisle, funneling millions of dollars into advertising. There is so much unregulated money floating around this campaign that it seems likely to produce a major scandal. We're living in a political atmosphere comparable to a film where viewers can clearly see something bad is about to happen, but the characters remain oblivious to what surrounds them. While a speech about change won't work, because Obama now represents the status quo, he and other Democrats should talk about one or two specific ideas for dealing with the hurricane of money that has hit our political shores. John King: To win, Obama must make history again . Even if many Americans still don't like Mitt Romney, and the tea party Republicans make it hard for the GOP to appeal to the center of the electorate, Democrats, with this economy, have a million points of vulnerability. They need to offer Americans something more than the status quo, something more than an alternative to what Democrats call radical conservatism. They need to offer Americans policies they can believe in.

"(CNN) -- The caller thought to be at the center of a phony threat that forced a US Airways flight to return to Philadelphia has been federally charged for the hoax, authorities said Friday. Kenneth W. Smith Jr., 26, is accused of ""knowingly engaging in conduct with intent to convey false and misleading information,"" after allegedly making a Thursday morning phone call to police, reporting a false threat about a passenger with ""liquid explosive"" aboard Flight 1267. The Philadelphia resident has since been arrested and could face up to 10 years in prison, $250,000 in fines and possible restitution, according to federal prosecutors. The suspected passenger, Christopher Shell, was briefly detained Thursday, though no explosives were found. Smith said his motive was to ""avenge"" Shell's ex-girlfriend, because Shell had ""posted a compromising picture of her on Facebook,"" according to an affidavit. A passenger told CNN affiliate WPVI that federal agents boarded the plane, drew their weapons on Shell, pulled him out of his seat and quickly removed him from the plane. Authorities say the Airbus A319, which was carrying 69 passengers, was cleared after all passengers were removed. Shell later boarded a second Dallas-bound flight Thursday, but he was again greeted by police when he landed. The 29-year-old birthday celebrant was arrested for unrelated outstanding warrants, said David Magana, a spokesman for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. It was not immediately clear if Shell has been charged. Neither Shell nor Smith could be reached for comment. Teen with Down syndrome stopped from boarding plane .

"(CNN) -- For the past week, Mitt Romney brought his presidential campaign abroad to England, Israel and Poland, leaving his initial footprint on the foreign policy landscape. He may have ventured off path once or twice, but, to paraphrase J.R.R Tolkien, not all those who travel are lost. He blazed his own trail, one that will do him much good at home and abroad. Before he even left for London, liberal commentators, on both sides of the Atlantic, jumped all over his alleged gaffe on Britain's readiness for the Olympics. Romney was asked a question by Brian Williams, which he answered like a technocrat, an expert, and one of the few men in the world who has run an Olympic Games. As Dorothy Rabinowitz so wisely noted, ""He did what a man who prizes his authority on a subject does -- he answered. He reflected on possibilities. It was a serious subject -- his subject."" If he's to be blamed for anything, it's speaking too much like an expert and not a politician. Critics of Romney often patronize him for sounding too scripted and too much like a politician. Now, when he speaks openly and freely, they criticize him for not being enough of a politician or diplomat. They can't have it both ways. From England he traveled to Israel, where he strongly backed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli people and subtly distanced himself from President Barack Obama by vocalizing bolder action against Iran. ""We must not delude ourselves into thinking that containment is an option,"" Romney said. ""We must lead the effort to prevent Iran from building and possessing nuclear weapons capability. We should employ any and all measures to dissuade the Iranian regime from its nuclear course."" Opinion: Romney on Iran is just like Obama . But rather than focus on Iran, our most pressing foreign policy dilemma, the liberal media manufactured another alleged gaffe -- Romney's comments on the cultural differences between Israelis and Palestinians. Again, much ado about nothing. It's hard to dispute the powerful and rich culture of the Jewish people, especially when quoting ""The Wealth and Poverty of Nations"" by David Landes, an erudite Harvard professor. To his credit, Romney didn't let this slow him down. He concluded the trip by traveling to Poland for a full embrace of Lech Walesa and the Polish people, a strong contrast to the cold shoulder Obama gave to Poland earlier in his presidency. In 2008, despite direct threats from Russia, Poland agreed to accept U.S. missile defense sites. In 2009, Obama folded to Russian criticism and abandoned the missile system, in turn abandoning the Polish people. In a not so subtle jab to the president, Romney declared in Poland, ""I believe it is critical to stand by those who have stood by America. Solidarity was a great movement that freed a nation. And it is with solidarity that America and Poland face the future."" Romney's closeness to Walesa and the Polish freedom fighters is nothing short of Reaganesque. At a time when the president tries desperately to compare him to George W. Bush, Romney is making Obama look and feel more like Jimmy Carter. Opinion: When did the GOP become the whiners? To those who doubt Romney's political adroitness, examine his deep respect for Catholicism both in Poland and here in the United States. Speaking of the Soviet Union, Romney added, ""The false gods of the all-powerful state claim the allegiance of a lonely few. It is for us, in this generation and beyond, to show all the world what free people and free economies can achieve for the good of all."" Given that the controversial Department of Health and Human Services' contraception mandate, viewed by many Catholics as a direct threat to their religious conscience, went into effect August 1 for all employers, other than churches and houses of worship (religiously affiliated institutions such as Catholic hospitals and universities have a one-year exemption before they must comply), this statement is timely and bold. Romney also embraced Pope John Paul II, a Polish and Catholic hero, one of the men most responsible for the fall of Communism. ""And here, in 1979, a son of Poland, Pope John Paul II, spoke words that would bring down an empire and bring freedom to millions who lived in bondage. 'Be not afraid' -- those words changed the world,"" Romney said. The contrast could not be clearer -- ""Be not afraid"" or ""You didn't build that"" -- one man's vision of hope, resolution and encouragement versus condescension, apathy and inertness. If this is the electoral choice Romney can frame for the nation, he will be one step closer to the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: In his trip to England, Israel and Poland, Mitt Romney blazed his own trail .

"(CNN) -- Responding to an allegation by the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Pakistan's main intelligence agency has a ""longstanding relationship"" with a Taliban-allied insurgent group that targets U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a senior Pakistani intelligence official said: ""We do have a relationship: that of an adversary."" ""We have made our resolve very clear that (the Haqqani Network) is an enemy we need to fight together,"" said the official, who did not want to be identified discussing intelligence matters. In an interview that aired Wednesday on Pakistan's Geo TV, Adm. Michael Mullen spoke forcefully about the Haqqani Network, which he said ""very specifically facilitates and supports the Taliban who move in Afghanistan, and they're killing Americans."" ""I can't accept that and I will do everything I possibly can to prevent that specifically,"" he said. Then Mullen said Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence ""has a longstanding relationship with the Haqqani Network. That doesn't mean everybody in the ISI, but it's there."" ""I also have an understanding that the ISI and the (Pakistani military) exist to protect their own citizens, and there's a way they have done that for a long period of time,"" Mullen said. ""I believe that over time, that's got to change."" Based in Pakistan's North Waziristan frontier, the Haqqani Network ""has been at the forefront of insurgent activity in Afghanistan, responsible for many high-profile attacks,"" according to the United Nations. The group is believed to have three main sources of funds: donations from the Persian Gulf region, drug trafficking, and al Qaeda payments. Pakistani forces in December announced they had seized Nasiruddin Haqqani, son of the group's leader, Jalaluddin Haqqani. Other U.S. officials in recent months had expressed concerns that Pakistan has not been aggressively confronting militants operating in the tribal regions. The Pakistani intelligence official told CNN that ""we have our hands full"" fighting other Islamist militant groups along the border with Afghanistan, notably those under the umbrella of the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT)  ""and once we are through with them we can turn on the other (the Haqqanis). We do not have the capacity to undertake simultaneous operations."" The official said the ""onus of providing proof of this"" relationship was on the Americans and it was not up to the ISI ""to start providing clarification."" Asked if offense was taken by Mullen's remarks, the intelligence official said: ""Not personally, no."" Earlier in the Geo TV interview, Mullen was pressed on issues such as the arrest of CIA contractor Raymond Davis and unmanned drone strikes against targets within Pakistan, which have marked what he called a ""rough patch"" of increasingly complex relations between the two nations in recent months. The admiral traced the difficulties back to the 12-year period in which the two countries had severed diplomatic ties, then restored them in the midst of the global terrorism crisis that followed the attacks of September 11, 2001. ""We can't snap our fingers and say all of the sudden we trust each other,"" he said, ""and that's what we're trying to work our way through in the midst of these huge terrorist challenges that we both have."" ""It's the focus from the United States' perspective on the terrorist threat (in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas), the al Qaeda leadership which still lives there and still threatens to kill as many Americans as they possibly could, combined with what I would call this federation of terrorist organizations that are getting along more than they used to, and at least from my experience ... the complexity is increasing, not decreasing."" As Joint Chiefs chairman, Mullen is the highest-ranking uniformed official in the U.S. military's chain of command. He has been part of recent discussions that have included CIA Director Leon Panetta and their Pakistani counterparts: Chief of Army Staff Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and the ISI's director, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha. Mullen's term is set to end this year. ""It's been a very rough patch lately,"" Mullen said, ""and I think the leaders, including Generals Pasha and Kayani, Director Panetta and myself and others are very committed to working our way through this because we see the need to solve this problem, and we just can't walk away from it.""

"London (CNN) -- So, after a mere half-century, German pharmaceutical firm Gruenenthal has decided to apologize for the devastating effects its drug, thalidomide, had on thousands of babies and their families around the world, myself included. Is this a reason to celebrate? Is it even a reason for cautious optimism, or is it simply a piece of news management designed to salvage what is left of its corporate reputation? Gruenenthal's chief executive, Harald Stock, made the apology Friday as he inaugurated a memorial to those affected in Stolberg, Germany, where the company is based. I was aware of Herr Stock long before his name was flashed around newsrooms all over the world when he made his momentous announcement. Together with others, I've been campaigning for justice for the global thalidomide community for the past decade. At one point Herr Stock, who replaced Sebastian Wirtz as head of Gruenenthal, agreed to a meeting. We held preliminary discussions, however the process broke down acrimoniously before we ever got to meet Herr Stock after it became clear to all of us that the company had no intention of negotiating a lasting settlement -- one that would have kept them out of the headlines forever and which would have left the Wirtz family with its considerable fortune intact. Personal account: A life shaped by bad medicine . So why the apology now? I think it is not unconnected with successful litigation in Australia that has resulted in a multi-million dollar settlement for a hitherto unrecognized thalidomide survivor, Lynette Rowe. Although the settlement was achieved at the expense of the British and Australian successor company to the distributor of thalidomide, Diageo, Gruenenthal was also named in proceedings. The writing was spray-painted on the wall for Mr Stock and the board of Gruenenthal. We believe the drug had its origins in the Nazi death camps in Poland -- as uncovered by two solicitors working on behalf of survivors of thalidomide. It is also a matter of record that Gruenenthal's board in the 1950s included a prominent and convicted Nazi war criminal, Otto Ambros. Respected historian and director of The Thalidomide Trust, Dr Martin Johnson, who has himself uncovered much damning evidence against Gruenenthal has said: ""This is a company that has evil written into its DNA."" Earlier this year, Lynette Rowe's lawyers lodged previously secret Gruenenthal records with an Australian court, revealing that for at least two years before the drug was removed from the market in late 1961, German medical professionals had told the company's staff they believed women who had taken thalidomide during pregnancy, had given birth to children with deformities. In the U.S., concerns were such that it was never approved for use by pregnant women. In March 1961 the board could have sensibly decided to withdraw thalidomide from the market in light of claims of birth defects and nerve damage to people taking it. Instead it decided to carry on regardless -- there was far too much money to be made from peddling its toxic 'wonder drug'. The battle for financial redress will not end with this apology. In fact, if anything, it will make those still fighting for compensation even more resolute. In Australia there is a class action under way and in Ireland, survivors there are launching their own legal action. We, in the UK, are also continuing to work for a permanent settlement. So my advice to Stock and the Wirtz family is as follows: Admit that the drug was not adequately tested prior to release; admit that evidence of harmful side-effects was ignored and concealed; and admit that crucial documents 'went missing' and were unavailable to prosecutors in Germany in 1970 which would have proved corporate and individual guilt once and for all. Those thalidomiders who are still alive are ageing -- and faster than we should because of our disabilities. To help us live as comfortably and independently as possible costs money. Adaptations, medical costs and personal assistants are not cheap. Thalidomide has deprived us of the lives we should have had and many more of any life at all. I believe that both morally and legally, Gruenenthal has a responsibility to help us and will continue to fight until that happens. The Wirtz family has grown fat on the backs of thousands of families whose lives have been torn apart by a medicine originally marketed as ""totally without harm."" If they really want to make amends, they should put their entire wealth at the disposal of the world's thalidomide survivors before it's too late. Britain apologizes to thalidomide victims . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Geoff Adams-Spink.","Geoff Adams-Spink has been campaigning for justice for the global thalidomide community .

"(CNN) -- Sikhs and their supporters in the United States and India reacted with sorrow, disbelief and anger Sunday to news of a shooting at a temple in Wisconsin that left at least seven people, including the suspected gunman, dead. Here's some what they said: . -- The Sikh Coalition . The Sikh Coalition, which describes itself as the largest Sikh American civil rights organization in the United States, has started an emergency response. ""The Sikh Coalition's thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the shooting, the Sikh community of Milwaukee, and the larger community of Wisconsin, which we know will stand with their Sikh neighbors with their support and prayers during this very trying time,"" said Sapreet Kaur, the group's executive director. ""There have been multiple hate crime shootings within the Sikh community in recent years and the natural impulse of our community is to unfortunately assume the same in this case. Let's let law enforcement investigate the case and as new facts emerge the dialogue can change. Americans died today in a senseless act of violence and Americans of all faiths should stand in unified support with their Sikh brothers and sisters,"" he added. -- Shiromani Akali Dal, political party in India . India's Sikh party is planning to hold a demonstration near the American embassy in New Delhi on Monday. ""The U.S. government should act decisively to stop these inhuman attacks,"" said Manjit Singh, a senior member of the Shiromani Akali Dal party. There are around 25 million followers of Sikhism worldwide. Most live in India. -- Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka, Wisconsin temple member . Kaleka, who helped police interview witnesses, decried the attack as a hate crime. Authorities have not classified it as such, saying they are treating the shooting as a ""domestic terrorist-type incident."" ""It seems like this person has this 9/11 tattoo, obviously has some animosity about those incidents, and ignorantly takes it out on a community that he thinks are responsible -- which is ludicrous in every way. Not only are we Sikh, we're not Muslim. But Muslims themselves are not responsible as a group for that,"" said Kaleka. Just days after September 11, 2001, a Sikh man was gunned down outside an Arizona gas station, apparently because he looked Muslim or Arab. Balbir Singh Sodhi was neither. He was a Sikh, and the first person to be murdered in retaliation for the 9/11 attacks. Those attacks provoked a wave of organizing among Sikhs worried about being mistakenly targeted. -- Surinder Singh, spokesman for the Guru Nanak Mission Society of Atlanta . Singh echoed the idea that Sikhs can be confused for Muslims and Hindus and have been targeted because of that potential. Sikh women are less identifiable than men, who customarily wear beards and turbans. Many American Sikh women dress like other Westerners or wear the salwar kameez, a traditional north Indian garment of a long shirt and loose-fitting pants. The entire Sikh community ""will be kind of scared"" following Sunday's killings, Singh said. -- The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee . The committee urged members of the Arab, Muslim and South Asian-American communities to exercise ""extreme"" caution at places of worship in the wake of the Wisconsin attack. It also urged those same people to report incidents of harassment, abuse or violence. ""The increase of anti-Muslim rhetoric by certain media personalities, elected officials, and political hopefuls is detrimental to our Country; and, as already experienced, leads to an increase in hate crimes against Arab, Muslim, and South Asian-Americans, as well as those perceived to be Arab or Muslim,"" the committee said in a statement. ""ADC will continue to stand with the Sikh American community, and other minority groups, in combating discrimination and hate,"" it added. CNN's Harmeet Singh contributed to this report.","The largest Sikh American civil rights organization in the United States calls for unity .

"Editor's Note: Actor and writer Joseph C. Phillips has appeared widely on television, including on ""The Cosby Show,"" ""General Hospital"" and ""Without a Trace,"" and in films and theater. He writes a syndicated column and is the author of the book, ""He Talk Like A White Boy."" Joseph C. Phillips  with his wife, Nicole, of 14 years, and their children, Connor, 10, Ellis, 8, and Samuel, 6. (CNN) -- I was truly honored to participate in the CNN documentary ""Black in America."" As often happens in projects of such ambition, it is difficult for everyone to have sufficient time to flesh out ideas. Though I went on tape with the program's producers for several hours, it just wasn't possible to explore all of my ideas at length. Working in Hollywood, I am used to ending up on the cutting room floor. That's life in the big city. Soledad O'Brien and I had a long conversation about sentencing disparities among black and white criminals -- specifically, the disparity between sentencing for crack cocaine and powder cocaine. The context of our conversation concerned whether the sentencing disparity was evidence of the racism inherent in the criminal justice system. Despite efforts by the Supreme Court and the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase flexibility in sentencing, the punishment for possession by a first-time offender of more than 5 grams of crack cocaine is a minimum 5-year prison sentence -- while possession of any amount of powder cocaine is a misdemeanor punishable by no more than a year in prison. In the mid-1980s, when these mandatory minimum sentences came into effect, America was experiencing a surge in violent crime, much of it fueled by the introduction of a new and extremely profitable (to say nothing of addictive) form of cocaine -- crack. There was tremendous violence associated with the crack cocaine trade as drug gangs fought over territory. The media told us that our neighborhoods were filling with crack babies -- children born addicted to cocaine because their mothers smoked the deadly toxin while pregnant. Our representatives in Congress, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus, decided to take a tough stance and supported harsh sentencing guidelines for selling crack cocaine. I have little sympathy for men and women who prey on the innocent hardworking members of the community. I am particularly critical of men who are guilty of criminal behavior, as this runs counter to what I see as one of the primary duties of men: to be guardians of the home and of the community, not parasites on that community. I am, however, uncertain that society gains very much by sentencing thousands of young black men to prison for nonviolent drug offenses. The sentences introduce them to a system from which it is difficult to extricate themselves and begins the downward path to joblessness, absentee fatherhood and more criminal behavior -- in short, creating more of the very behavior we are trying to discourage. The disparity in the guidelines' impact does not in my mind prove systemic racism. I would, however, argue that it does not represent the best the American justice system has to offer and in fact undermines faith in that very system, especially among black folk. Studies show that more than 50 percent of inmates have drug and alcohol problems. When we are discussing nonviolent offenders, I think it may be prudent to spend a bit more time with rehabilitation as opposed to tossing folk in jail. We have tried for many years to attack the supply side of this equation; it is in my humble opinion time to begin addressing the demand side and approach the drug war as a health issue. We also need to get a handle on single parenthood and absentee fathers. Responsible members of our community cannot stress enough the effects of single parenthood on the development of children and how that development translates into criminal behavior in the community. Studies indicate that nearly 90 percent of the change in violent crime rates in a neighborhood can be accounted for by the change in percentages of out-of-wedlock births. Children from fatherless homes are: • 9 times more likely to drop out of high school. • 10 times more likely to abuse chemical substances. • 20 times more likely to end up in prison. These are sobering statistics. A change in the sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine will have very little effect if we do not begin to commit this community to raising our children in two-parent homes. Finally, there must be a corresponding responsibility on the part of citizens to avoid drugs and alcohol and obey the law. There must also be a continued demand by the rest of us that our fellow citizens engage in moral and ethical behavior. We must insist that concepts like nobility, duty and honor are not sacrificed on the altar of relativism. Nothing distresses me more than the e-mails I receive attempting to explain away the antisocial and criminal behavior of some of our neighbors as the result of poverty and or racism. (Left unanswered, of course, is why they who have also been targets of racism and economic hardship are not engaged in criminal behavior.) To suggest that people attempt to live lives of virtue is not simplistic. It is in fact wisdom that is preached in our houses of worship each and every Sabbath day. Whether it concerns sexual behavior, decisions concerning our education or how we conceive of civil behavior, when it comes to creating lives of purpose and fulfillment nothing will replace the individual accessing the wisdom that has been passed down from antiquity. In the words of the poet William Ernest Henley: . It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.

"(CNN) -- Louisiana officials took steps Saturday to ease pressure on a lock near the Pearl River and keep it from failing, one of several crises brewing days after Isaac barreled through the area as a hurricane. Earlier in the day, the state's office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness posted on Twitter that ""Pearl River Lock No. 2 is in danger of failing"" and urged ""anyone living in the mandatory evacuation area to leave immediately."" St. Tammany Parish warned on its website at 1:15 p.m. that ""failure of Lock 2 is imminent!"" The lock is on a man-made canal off the Pearl River. The evacuation order applies to those living in a stretch from Bush to Hickory, an area Lindsey deBlieux from the Louisiana Recovery Authority described as fairly rural. Buses were sent to the area to pick up residents, and evacuees were urged to call 211 to get in contact with a local Red Cross shelter. After getting permission from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, authorities on Saturday ""opened some valves"" to prevent the lock from failing, St. Tammany Parish spokeswoman Suzanne Stymiest told CNN on Saturday evening. ""We are beginning to relieve some of the pressure, and we are hopeful,"" Stymiest said. ""However, the mandatory evacuation is still in place. We cannot determine (yet) that we have been successful."" St. Tammany Parish also warned residents of another potential mass flooding problem -- the Pearl River itself. That river is expected to crest early Monday at 18.5 feet and could rise even higher, the parish said on its website. It then listed 35 subdivisions, four mobile home parks and one campsite in an area that extends south to Lake Pontchartrain that may be ""potentially affected"" by rising waters. Meanwhile, what's left of Isaac continued to chug northward Saturday, scattering rain on parts of the Midwest where farmers and ranchers have been facing a drought so severe that it prompted emergency disaster assistance last month. The storm system moved into western Missouri and Illinois, bringing much need rain to isolated areas, forecasters said. ""Come take a visit,"" said farmer Brad Detring of Farmington, Missouri, referring to the remnants of Issac. Isaac leaves distress, perspective in southeastern Louisiana . Earlier Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard said it had fully reopened the lower Mississippi River -- an area that stretches from Baton Rouge to the Gulf of Mexico. The channel was opened at 10 p.m. Friday, after it had been partly opened for large vessels the evening before, the Coast Guard reported. ""The Mississippi River system is a vital part of the U.S. economy, so we are very pleased we can open the river to those who depend on it,"" said Capt. Peter Gautier. Coast Guard teams are continuing to monitor the area and respond to a ""number of ship groundings and barge strandings along the riverbank caused by the river surge and high winds of the storm."" Isaac contributed to at least 19 deaths in Haiti, then caused at least four more total in Louisiana and Mississippi after hitting the United States earlier this week. While most people have their lights back on, hundreds of thousands were still without power Saturday night, including about 320,000 Entergy Louisiana customers. Isaac also brought flooding because of storm surges and heavy rains, including as much as 20 inches in New Orleans. Mississippi's Homochitto National Forest reported closures in several areas as a result of flooding. ""Safety remains and is always a high priority for us,"" said Bruce Prud'homme, Homochitto district ranger. ""Closing these areas is necessary for public safety."" South of New Orleans, Plaquemines Parish was among the hardest-hit areas as fast-rising waters swamped scores of homes and businesses. Officials were intentionally breaching levees in strategic areas, in hopes of getting ""the bulk of this water out in five to seven days,"" Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser told CNN. He acknowledged, though, that drying the east and west banks of the Mississippi River in the parish could take 17 days. Gina Meyer, the parish's emergency medical services superintendent, said her home suffered wind damage during Hurricane Katrina seven years ago, and flooded this time as waters rose 14 feet higher than normal. Beyond efforts to lower water levels, Meyer said that residents could rely on each other to weather this ordeal. ""Trust in God, rely on your family, and it's not just the people that are blood related to you, it's the people you have grown up with all your life and that's what gets you through something like this,"" she said.

When: 1831 Who: Naturalist Charles Darwin Where: Galapagos Islands The boat: The HMS Beagle was a 90 ft, 10-gun former British Navy warship built in 1820. The ship was repurposed and commissioned for civilian exploration voyages in 1825. How long: Five years Legacy: Aboard the HMS Beagle, Darwin collected specimens and began to develop his theories of evolution, which would later crystallize in ""The Origin of Species."" Columbus discovers the New World . When: 1492 Who: Italian explorer Christopher Columbus Where: From Spain to the Caribbean The boats: The Santa Maria was a 70 ft, three-masted ship built from pine and oak, that could carry 40 men. The Nina and the Pinta were both smaller, nimbler boats with triangle-shaped masts better for navigating tricky waterways. The square-sail Santa Maria ran aground in modern-day Haiti on Christmas Day 1492. Legacy: Searching for a new way into the East Indies spice route, it was aboard these three ships that Columbus unintentionally discovered the Caribbean. 'Micro-yachtsman' crosses the Atlantic in miniature boat . When: 1993 Who: American Hugo Vihlen Where: Across the North Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Cornwall, England The boat: The Father's Day, the world's tiniest sailboat at a length of 5 ft 4 in, was so small that Vihlen had to roll up into a ball to sleep, and couldn't stand up without opening the hatch and risk taking on water. Likened to a space shuttle, the boat is made from fiberglass-enclosed Airex foam and was fitted with GPS, a water maker, VHF radio and SSB/Ham radio. Legacy: Aboard the Father's Day, Vihlen became the world's first ""micro-yachtsman,"" but it wasn't all smooth sailing -- the boat was surrounded by whales, nearly capsized, and caught the tail end of a hurricane during its 105-day voyage. What world-changing voyages would you add to our list? Sound Off below . Magellan navigates Cape Horn . When: 1519 Who: Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan Where: Around the world bypassing Cape Horn, South America via a narrow strait The boat: Given to Magellan by King Charles I of Spain, The Victoria was the only one of five ships to complete the trip successfully. Only 18 of its original 237 crew members survived and the ship was so badly damaged it was only kept afloat by the crew continuously pumping water out of the hull. How long: Three years Legacy: During the first ever circumnavigation of the world Magellan discovered a shortcut through a waterway in the southern tip of Chile, which helped sailors to avoid the almost continuous ocean storms off Cape Horn. The voyage also established the need for an international date line -- as the explorers found upon return that their calendars were one day off. Pilgrims sail to Plymouth Rock . When: 1620 Who: The Pilgrims Where: From England to Plymouth Rock The boat: Primarily used as a cargo ship, in this instance the Mayflower, which was estimated to be between 90 and 110 ft, was used to transport 102 English separatists. How long: Two months Legacy: Half the Pilgrims died during the first winter on the Mayflower, but, in America, the ship continues to be a symbol of the bold English separatists who would encounter great hardships while they explored, and established colonies the modern-day U.S. east coast. Cook charts the Pacific . When: 1772-1775, 1778-1780 Who: English cartographer and explorer Captain James Cook Where: Pacific Ocean, Antarctic Circle The boat: Called ""the fittest ship for service I have ever seen"" by Cook, the HMS Resolution was fitted with the most advanced technology of the day, including an ""Azimuth compass,"" an ice anchor, a fresh water distiller, and 24 guns and small cannons. How long: Five years  Legacy: Cook charted maps of the Pacific so accurate that many were still used up until 50 years ago, and proved the nonexistence of the mythical ""Terra Australis"" continent believed to exist in the south Pacific. In the process, the HMS Resolution became the first ship to cross the Antarctic Circle. First solo circumnavigation of the globe . When: 1895 Who: Canadian sailor Joshua Slocum Where: From Boston to Rhode Island The boat: Given as a gift to Slocum in 1892, the rotting 36 ft vessel, The Spray, the sailor restored it for ""$553.62, and 13 months of my own labor."" How long: Three years Legacy: Slocum became the first person in history to successfully circumnavigate the world solo upon his return to Rhode Island in June 1898, inspiring generations of sailors to come. Yacht with tallest mast ever sets sail . When: Built in 2003 Who: Owned by American Joe Vittoria, former CEO of Avis Where: From Portsmouth, England to the Mediterranean Sea The boat: With an overall length of 247 ft, the Mirabella V is the largest single-masted boat in the world. The super-yacht's unprecedented mast extends up nearly 300 ft into the sky, and its main sail is over 16,000 sq ft -- the biggest in the world. Legacy: No expense was spared in the construction of Vittoria's luxurious yacht, which cost over $50 million to build. The Mirabella V spends her winters in the Carribean, her summers in the Mediterranean, and can be rented for around $400,000 per week -- but one tip: there isn't a single bridge in the world that the yacht can sail underneath. Phoenicians build empire on the seas  When: 1200-600 B.C. Who: Expert sailors of Phoenicia's maritime empire Where: Mediterranean Sea The boats: The Phoenicians improved upon the galley -- the ancient ship powered by rows of human oarsmen -- by inventing the ""bireme,"" a galley propelled by a second row of oars. Legacy: Through their skillful use ships to trade valuable Tyrian purple dyes, the seafaring Phoenicians -- who could be considered the world's first ""global capitalists"" -- built a maritime empire from Spain to the Middle East that dominated commercial trade in the Mediterranean for the better part of a millennium. Fastest circumnavigation of the globe . When: 2005 Who: French yachtsman Bruno Peyron Where: Around the world The boat: The Orange II, a 121 ft ""maxicat,"" a catamaran designed for ocean racing, with super heavy-duty sails that can withstand prolonged exposure to heavy winds. How long: 50 days, 16 hours, 20 minutes and four seconds Legacy: The Orange II shattered the previous world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the globe by nearly eight days -- and Peyron and his 12-man crew currently hold the Jules Verne Trophy, the prize given to the world's fastest circumnavigators.","The Pilgrims' voyage on the Mayflower to Plymouth Rock in 1620 .

"(CNN) -- In the history of organized athletics, there has never been a person who needs to come back again less than Michael Phelps. Yes, you have read that correctly. I am urging the greatest swimmer in all of sports to keep his word, forget about Rio in 2016 and retire. To go away. To vanish. To ignore his mother and his sisters and Matt Lauer and Mark Spitz and Rowdy Gaines and to once and for all hang up his goggles and Speedos. Go. Scram. Buzz off. Because athletics enthusiasts are a peculiar people (aka: crazy), we always beg our heroes to stick around longer than they should. It's the reason a portly, 40-year-old Ken Griffey Jr. hit .184 in Seattle in 2010 and the reason Bjorn Borg stepped back onto the tennis court in 1991 (wood racket in hand) -- only to win nary a single match. It's the reason our final snapshot of Sugar Ray Leonard is an embarrassing stoppage against Hector Camacho and the reason Jim Palmer arrived at spring training with Baltimore in 1991 throwing big, fat, Little League meatballs. Why, it's even the reason a 41-year-old Spitz, Phelps' predecessor as our own personal Aquaman, jumped back into the pool to qualify for the 1992 Games in Barcelona. He, of course, failed -- by a whopping two seconds. News: Olympic legend Phelps: 'I'm done with swimming' We convince these men and women that they can still do it, that it's worth one more shot, that age is just a number, that legend is a gift of the gods, and to not use it is shameful. (Gaines, the former Olympic swimmer who now works as an NBC commentator, recently said he believes Phelps will likely come back because ""he'll be able to walk through airports in a couple years and not be mobbed. He'll miss that."" There is a word for this line of thinking: sad.) Then, predictably, when they fall short, we bemoan that the effort was ever made. We offer comments such as, ""Boy, that was pathetic"" and ""He should have stayed retired"" -- forgetting that we were the ones pining for the return. Again, sports fan are crazy. Yet the inevitable disappointment of a then-31-year-old Phelps underperforming in Rio (and, for the record, 31 in swimming is 40 in real life) isn't the No. 1 reason he should stay away. No, Phelps needs to remain retired because, quite frankly, life in a pool sucks. OK, not for a week, while vacationing in Orlando. But imagine being Phelps. You wake up at 5 a.m., spend four hours in a pool, go home, sleep (in your Michael Jackson-esque oxygen tank), return to the pool for another two hours, eat (a disgustingly healthy and bland) dinner, go to bed, then repeat the following day. And the day after that. And the day after that. And the day after that. And ... For, hell, 1Â½ decades, Phelps' existence has revolved around the insidious smell of chlorine. When he talks, one can hear -- very clearly -- his weariness over the whole endeavor. ""These Olympics have been great, but. ..."" But Phelps needs a life. If I'm Debbie, Michael's mother, I cease with all the Rio jabber (really, the woman needs to stop) and say the following: ""Son, I'm proud of you. You've done amazing things. But you're 27, and life is short. You've made lots of money in endorsements. Use some of it. Here's a backpack, a Fodor's and a one-way ticket to Prague. Go see the world. Eat anything you want. Sleep in hostels, drink lots of beers, hit up Amsterdam and Barcelona and Geelong and Venice and Wolverhampton and Valletta. Tell the ladies you're Michael Phelps if it helps, or just pull your cap down low and call yourself Biff Stevens. Just make sure and live!"" When we watch the Olympics on TV, and the uplifting music is piped in and the anthems are played and tears stream down the cheeks of winners, we are witnessing a sliver of time -- a singular moment that encompasses 1/1,000,000,000th of an athlete's existence. It is romantic and lovely; Bev Oden the former Olympic volleyball star, calls the experience, ""the height of euphoria."" But that euphoria, like all things, passes, and at day's end many athletes are left wondering not whether they should have stayed on longer, but whether, in missing senior proms and romantic summer nights and family vacations, they surrendered too much. After three Olympic Games and 22 medals, it is time for Phelps to stop surrendering. It is time to live. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman: Michael Phelps should stick to his plan, forget Rio in 2016 and retire .
He says sports history is lousy with icons who didn't quit when they should have and fell short .
He says main reason to ignore advice to keep competing is that Phelps should begin to live life .

"New Brunswick, New Jersey (CNN) -- The man with whom Tyler Clementi had a sexual encounter is soon expected to take the stand in the trial of a former Rutgers University student accused of spying on Clementi. Wednesday marked the fourth day of Dharun Ravi's trial. Prosecutors say he and another student placed a camera in Clementi's dorm room without his knowledge to allegedly spy on his encounter with the man. Prosecutors have withheld the man's name, listing him only as ""M.B.,"" to protect his identity. He is expected to testify Thursday. Just days after the webcam incident in 2010, Clementi committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge, which connects New Jersey and Manhattan. Ravi, 20, now faces a 15-count indictment in Clementi's death that includes hate crime charges, charges of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with physical evidence, witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison. Last year, he turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time. The deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors would have required the former student to undergo 600 hours of community service, counseling and to dispose of any information that could identify the man who appeared in the web video with Clementi. Prosecutors also offered to help Ravi avoid deportation, though they said they could not guarantee it. Ravi is a citizen of India who had been studying on a visa at the New Jersey university. On Tuesday, the second student charged in the case took the stand again, saying she felt ""sad"" and ""overwhelmed"" in the wake of the incident. Molly Wei, 19, reached a plea deal that requires her to testify against Ravi. ""Police officers told me that they believe Tyler is missing and that he possibly committed suicide and I was feeling very -- I was sad, overwhelmed. I felt very bad if anything had happened,"" Wei told jurors during her second day of testimony. Prosecutor: ""These acts were purposeful"" Should Wei complete a three-year program on cyberbullying, as well as 300 hours of community service without any additional legal troubles, charges against her for allegedly watching the video will be dropped, according to prosecutors. She also testified about when she learned of messages Ravi allegedly sent about the stream. ""I was very surprised because my friends brought it up, and I had no idea how they knew, but they said that Dharun had told them. ... They told me about these Twitter, tweets, that they received on Tuesday about him trying to have a viewing party,"" said Wei. Less than a month after Clementi's suicide, President Barack Obama released a videotaped message condemning bullying. In November, Clementi's family consented to the use of his name on federal anti-harassment legislation called the ""Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act."" The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid ""to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student,"" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey.","NEW: A key witness is expected to testify Thursday .

"Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- Romania's president Traian Basescu was suspended on Friday, after the impeachment motion filed by the ruling coalition passed the Parliament's vote. Romania's coalition of Social Democrats and Liberals argued their action by saying that President Traian Basescu has breached the Constitution and overstepped his authority. The motion passed with 256 votes, 39 more than the minimum required. The country is expected to hold a referendum on July 29, when Romanians will have to vote whether they want Basescu to remain in office. During the suspension, National Liberal Party leader Crin Antonescu, who is also the president of the Senate, will assume the interim presidency. Earlier this week, Antonescu was appointed the president of the Senate. This position allows him to assume the president's attributions, in case the latter is suspended, according to the Constitution. Crin Antonescu said on Friday he is ready to step out of politics if Basescu wins the referendum. During his speech in parliament, before the vote, Basescu accused the ruling coalition of taking control of the country's judicial system and public institutions. He also expressed concern about the country's state of law and said this political turmoil will have long-term negative impacts on Romania. ""Take care of the country!"" Basescu said at the end of his speech. It is the second time Basescu has faced suspension since he took the power, eight years ago. The first time was in 2007, after which he won a referendum and returned to office. Earlier on Friday, Romania's Constitutional Court gave an ambiguous statement regarding the constitutional status of this impeachment motion. The judges approved some of the points from the motion, but they didn't make it clear whether Basescu has violated the Constitution or not. In any case, the Court played an advisory role this time, leaving the final word to the Parliament. The court issued a statement saying that one of its judges, Aspazia Cojocaru, received threats prior to court debates on the impeachment motion. The political developments sparked controversy in the international community. On Friday, the European Commission expressed concern about the country's political turmoil, ""especially regarding actions that appear to reduce the effective powers of independent institutions like the Constitutional Court."" The Commission's President Jose Manuel Barosso invited Romanian Prime Minister Ponta to Brussels next week to hold talks regarding the country's political developments. This after Ponta was accused of trying to dismantle the Constitutional Court by changing some of its judges. U.S. Ambassador to Romania Mark Gitenstein, said he was ""deeply concerned"" that the independence of the country's democratic institutions was under threat. In the meantime, hundreds of people protested on Friday, expressing their concern about the country's political crisis. While some Romanians believe the government is not respecting the rule of law and democratic principles, others expressed their support for the ruling coalition and called for Basescu to step down. Earlier this week Romania's Parliament passed a law making it easier to impeach Basescu, a decision that sparked some controversy. In addition, the prime minister accused some Constitutional Court judges of political bias and incompatibility and suggested that they should be replaced. The ruling coalition this week sacked the heads of both chambers of Parliament, who were Basescu allies, and replaced them with politicians close to the prime minister. It also dismissed the country's ombudsman, whom it accused of political bias. The newly appointed ombudsman, Valer Dorneanu, is a former Social Democrat member of Parliament. Basescu's suspension is the latest in a series of attacks between the prime minister and the president. The two men also argued over who was entitled to represent Romania at last month's meeting of the European Council in Brussels. Ponta received parliament's vote to go to Brussels on behalf of the country, but the Constitutional Court ruled the president had the right to attend the event. In the end, the prime minister ignored the court's ruling and traveled to Brussels. Romania's government became the object of international criticism after the prime minister was accused of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis. Ponta dismissed the accusation as a political attack from Basescu. The country's political turmoil has dropped Romania's currency, Leu, to the lowest level in the last two weeks.","NEW: Parliament votes to suspend the president .

"(CNN) -- A man who in 2001 ran over five people, killing four of them, then exclaimed he was the ""angel of death,"" will be transferred from a California mental hospital to a less restrictive facility. David Attias, son of director Daniel Attias, has been at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino, California, for the past 10 years. On February 23, 2001, David Attias sped down a road in Isla Vista, near the campus of the University of California-Santa Barbara. He ran over five people and hit nine parked cars. Elie Israel, Chris Divis, Nick Bourdakis and Ruth Levy died that night and Ruth's brother, Albert, suffered debilitating injuries. Attias was reportedly forcibly detained by witnesses that night and told them he was the ""angel of death."" He was convicted in June 2002 of four murders, but a week later a jury ruled him not guilty by reason insanity. This month, Judge Thomas R. Adams ruled that Attias can be released from the hospital and be treated at a less restrictive facility. But if Attias ""falters in his treatment rehabilitation"" he will be sent back to Patton hospital. ""The David Attias that was called to testify by the prosecution was clearly not the same vacant, troubled and confused David Attias that this court first became acquainted with in 2001."" Santa Barbara Senior Deputy District Attorney Paula Waldman told CNN affiliate KTLA that Attias, now 30, should stay at Patton State Hospital. ""You can't ignore history,"" Waldman said, according to the KTLA report. ""Every scientist will tell you the best predictor of the future is the past. He is a violent human being."" One of the victims' fathers agreed. ""A lot of people, unfortunately, could get hurt,"" Tony Bourdakis told KTLA. Attias' attorney, public defender Deedrea Edgar, said he will still get around-the-clock state supervision at the new facility. He just won't be behind walls and barbed wire anymore, she said. In the ruling, Adams said he heard from seven witnesses and only one health professional objected to Attias being released. That person had never met Attias, the judge noted. Adams wrote that each defense witness said Attias was no longer a danger to others.","David Attias has been behind the walls of a mental hospital for 10 years .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai police added a drunken driving charge against a Red Bull energy drink heir accused of ramming a police officer with his Ferrari and fleeing the scene, authorities said Friday. Authorities charged the drink creator's grandson with negligent death and hit-and-run after the crash. They said he had a high alcohol content, an additional charge that if found guilty, would add up to 10 years to his sentence, according to Police Maj. Gen. Anuchai Lekbumrung. CNN attempts to reach the suspect's attorney were unsuccessful. The arrest of Vorayud Yoovidhaya -- a member of one of Thailand's richest families -- has sparked a controversy over the nation's justice system. At first, police allegedly tried to cover up the 27-year-old's involvement by arresting a suspect who pretended to be driving the car at the time. The arrest of the bogus suspect led to the suspension of a police officer. The officer killed in the crash, Police Sgt. Major Wichien Klanprasert, was responding to a robbery call when his motorcycle was hit by what a witness described as a black sports car early Monday, authorities said. His cremation is planned for Friday evening, relatives said. Investigators said they followed the path of leaked oil from the crash scene to the suspect's home. Police entered his mansion with a search warrant and found his Ferrari, which was wrecked on the front and had deployed air bags, authorities said. The heir has admitted driving the car and hitting the motorcycle, but he claimed he was suddenly cut off by the bike, according to Lekbumrung. He was charged with hit-and-run and causing a death with negligence, and was released on a bond of 500,000 baht (About $16,000). An investigation is under way to determine how fast he was driving, police said. The suspect's grandfather, Chaleo Yoovidhaya, teamed with an Austrian businessman to create the Red Bull brand and products. His father, Chalerm Yoovidhaya, is an executive with the energy drink company. His father has attended evening services for the officer at the local temple, said Natthanan Klanpraert, the victim's sister-in-law. The suspect and his mother also stopped by the temple Thursday afternoon, but the victim's family was not around, she said.","Red Bull heir is accused of killing a police officer in hit-and-run .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court on Thursday postponed a decision on whether to grant bail to a Christian girl accused of burning pages of the Quran in a case that has heightened religious tensions in the capital, Islamabad. The Pakistani authorities have come under pressure to guarantee the safety of the girl, identified as Rimsha, in a country where people accused of blasphemy have been killed by members of the public in the past. Tahir Naveed Choudhry, one of Rimsha's lawyers, has sought bail for her, saying she is legally a minor and should be reunited with her parents rather than kept in a jail where adults are also being held. To back up his argument, Choudhry cited a report on Tuesday by an independent medical board stating that Rimsha was 14. The doctors who examined her also concluded that her mental age was lower than her chronological age. But on Thursday, the lawyer for the man accusing Rimsha queried the legal validity of the board's report. The lawyer, Rao Abdur Raheem, said the seven-doctor board was constituted by the local authorities, not by court order. As a result, the court adjourned until Saturday to allow time to verify the medical report. Raheem said he was representing the accuser free of charge because he believes God will reward him for his work. The police have said that Rimsha is illiterate and has not attended school. They said last week that she had told them that she had no idea that there were pages of the Quran inside the documents she alleged to have burned. The court faces a difficult decision amid concerns that if Rimsha is released on bail, she could be at risk from Muslims angered by the allegations against her. Choudhry, who is also a leading member of the Christian community and member of the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, said Rimsha is too young to stay in prison and would be safer joining her family, who are now in hiding. ""She was crying in the jail and missing her parents,"" he said. Choudhry says he expects Rimsha's trial to last as long as two years. She would remain in custody for its duration, if bail is denied, he said. If she is tried as a minor, she might also receive a milder sentence if convicted. As an adult, she faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for willful desecration of the Quran, Choudhry said . Rimsha was accused by a local resident of burning pages of the Muslim holy text after she gathered paper as fuel for cooking in Islamabad, according to the authorities. The man said he found her carrying ashes that included burned pages of the Quran in a small bag. Choudhry has said that nobody actually saw Rimsha burning the papers. The case has already had a severe effect on people in the area. Hundreds of Christian families have had to leave the area for fear of violence, Choudhry said. The police said last week that about 150 people had gathered on August 17 -- the day Rimsha was arrested -- in the area where the neighborhood's Christian population lives and threatened to burn down their houses. In a statement last week, President Asif Ali Zardari said he had called for an urgent report on the incident and added that vulnerable sections of society must be protected ""from any misuse of the blasphemy law."" ""Blasphemy by anyone cannot be condoned but no one will be allowed to misuse blasphemy law for settling personal scores,"" said the president's spokesman, Farhatullah Babar. Critics of the controversial law say it is being used to persecute religious minorities. ""If any Muslim is accused for blasphemy, people don't burn houses,"" Choudhry said. ""But if the accused is a non-Muslim, mob burns our entire villages."" Pakistan is home to about 2 million Christians, who make up more than 1% of the Islamic nation's population, according to government statistics. Rimsha's case ""illustrates the erosion of the rule of law and the dangers faced by those accused of blasphemy in Pakistan,"" the human rights advocacy group Amnesty International said in a statement last week. CNN's Aliza Kassim in Atlanta; and journalists Aamir Iqbal in Islambad and Katie Hunt in Hong Kong contributed to this report.","The Christian girl's lawyer says she would be safer in hiding with her family .

"(CNN) -- The Russian Football Union (RFU) has appointed Fabio Capello as the new national team manager. The former England coach will be hoping to revive the fortunes of a promising Russian squad after a disappointing Euro 2012, where they crashed out at the group stages. ""Today we decided to appoint Capello as our national team's new manager,"" RFU deputy president Nikita Simonyan told ITAR-TASS news agency. Simonyan, the acting chief of the Union, said they expected the Italian ""to come to Moscow in the nearest future to finalize the details of his contract and sign it."" Capello is expected in the Russian capital on Wednesday or Thursday. The 66-year-old has previously coached the English national side to quarterfinals at the 2010 World Cup and 2008 European Championships. He quit in February after the English FA stripped John Terry of the national side's captaincy without his consultation. Before moving into international football Capello won domestic and continental titles with AC Milan, Juventus, Roma and Spanish side Real Madrid. Capello had been part of a managerial wish list published by the RFU featuring, amongst others, former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez and World Cup winning Italian manager Marcello Lippi. Capello told the Italian news agency ANSA that he was ""happy and proud"" to be taking charge of the Russian national team. ""I'll be happy if my work with the Russian team will go the right way. The cooperation with this team is a great challenge for me as Russia is a great country."" World Soccer Magazine's executive editor Keir Radnedge told CNN the Russian national team ""wanted international pedigree, they felt this was important."" ""They want pedigree, achievement, which whatever he did or didn't do with England he certainly did at club level,"" he said. ""They felt he qualified England for two major tournaments and he got them through the group stages. He's now got the international tournament pedigree he didn't have before he got the England job."" Capello replaces the Dutch coach Dick Advocaat, whose Russian team crashed out of Euro 2012 after a surprise defeat by Greece in the group stages. Russia is hosting the 2018 FIFA World Cup and Radnedge believes this had a bearing on Capello's appointment. ""There has been talk that if he gets them through the next two years then he could go on to the hosting in Russia. It is important for the Russians to build their own kudos on the world stage. They've gone to so many tournaments and started like world beaters and really fizzled out halfway along the course."" Capello's first game in charge will be against Northern Ireland on September 7 when Russia begin their campaign to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.","Fabio Capello is the new manager of the Russian national team .

"(CNN) -- Little Gabriel Johnson was 8-months-old when he was last spotted alive at a Texas motel in late 2009. Almost three years later, his disappearance is still a mystery. And a trial that gets underway this week may finally provide some answers to what happened. Jury selection begins Wednesday in the trial of Gabriel's mother, Elizabeth Johnson, who is charged with kidnapping, custodial interference and child abuse in the case. On December 17, 2009, a judge awarded Johnson and Logan McQueary, the boy's father, joint custody of Gabriel. But Johnson allegedly defied the ruling and set out for Texas with her son. McQueary didn't hear from Johnson until several days later, when she reportedly sent him a text message saying she'd killed Gabriel and put his body in a Dumpster. ""I killed him,"" Johnson said in a text to McQueary on December 27, 2009. ""U will never see Gabriel again, I made sure of that. And you can spend the rest of ur pathetic life wondering about him."" The scathing series of texts continued. ""U will never find me im already bording a plane. Out of the country,"" Johnson said. ""When im safe ill email u the exact location of dead gabriels little blue body. If the garbage don't come first."" McQueary also recorded a phone call from Johnson in which she made similar claims. Johnson: ""You made me do this."" McQuery: ""You did not hurt Gabriel."" Johnson: ""Yes, I did. I suffocated him. .... I suffocated him and he turned blue. And I put him in his diaper bag and I put him in the trash can."" She later recanted her statements, CNN affiliate KPHO-TV reported. Johnson was arrested on December 30, 2009, in Miami Beach, Florida. She told police that she'd given the boy to a unknown couple she met up with in San Antonio. She said she did so under the direction of a woman named Tammi Smith. Johnson and Smith had met in June 2009, when both women were waiting for the same flight in the Indianapolis airport. Smith suggested to the young mother that she and her husband adopt Gabriel. Johnson said she called Smith that December to ask if the couple was still interested. This May, Smith was found guilty of forgery and conspiracy to interfere with Gabriel's custody. In July, she was sentenced to probation and 30 days in jail. Smith's conviction does not relate to the boy's disappearance, but her efforts to conspire with Johnson to deny McQueary his rights to see his son. Jurors also accepted prosecutors' argument that Smith falsely wrote the name of her cousin on a paternity document to falsely assert that he -- and not McQueary -- was Gabriel's father. The defendant addressed the court at the time, admitting that she helped Johnson and helped care for Gabriel for nine days. Smith eventually apologized for any ""pain and suffering"" that helping Johnson may have caused, even as she firmly insisted that her intentions were good. ""I never intended to hurt anybody,"" Johnson said, adding that she just wanted to help a single mother who she felt was in need.

"(CNN) -- Canada suspended relations with Iran and expelled the country's diplomats Friday, calling the country's regime ""the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today."" Iranian diplomats in Canada have five days to get out, Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said Friday in a scathing statement. Canada's diplomatic staff has already left Iran, and Baird advised all Canadians to avoid travel to the country. U.N.'s Ban, in Iran, slams Holocaust denial, hostility to Israel . Among other things, Iran ""refuses to comply with U.N. resolutions pertaining to its nuclear program; it routinely threatens the existence of Israel and engages in racist anti-Semitic rhetoric and incitement to genocide; it is among the world's worst violators of human rights; and it shelters and materially supports terrorist groups,"" Baird said. He also called out the regime for providing military support to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been widely criticized in international circles for the government's bloody effort to suppress a rebellion. ""Moreover,"" Baird said, ""the Iranian regime has shown blatant disregard for the Vienna Convention and its guarantee of protection for diplomatic personnel. Under the circumstances, Canada can no longer maintain a diplomatic presence in Iran. Our diplomats serve Canada as civilians, and their safety is our number one priority."" A spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry slammed the decision Saturday.

"(CNN) -- The massacre of students and a teacher within the seemingly safe hallways of Columbine High School reverberated so strongly that its reflection can be found in the creations of multiple artists, writers, musicians, and filmmakers over the past decade. ""Elephant,"" musician Marilyn Manson, and the bestseller ""Nineteen Minutes"" entered the spotlight post-Columbine. ""It wasn't the first school shooting, but it became the extreme case,"" said Robert Thompson, founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. ""The word 'Columbine' became a word that represented something much, much larger than that particular high school."" Columbine, in some ways, represents the broad insecurity triggered by extreme acts of violence. Littleton, Colorado, is as picturesque as the set of a family film. And thanks in part to the 24-hour news cycle, the world witnessed scenes that appeared to be out of a movie: bloodied victims escaping through windows and frightened teens scurrying to safety as law enforcement descended. Film critic Desson Thomson said films such as Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" do not have to reach far into the American psyche to tell a tale of horror in a post-Columbine world. ""Columbine is now a little like the way 9/11 is engrained in our cultural perspective, so that something like 'Elephant' doesn't even have to directly allude to it,"" he said. ""Because we were so immersed in Columbine...the filmmakers know that the audience has that reference point, so it doesn't take much to even poke at that for all of that dimension to come swimming through our consciousness."" ""Elephant,"" which won two awards at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003, dramatized a normal day at a high school that is about to become the scene of a planned mass slaughter by a pair of friends. Television shows such as ""Law & Order"" and ""Cold Case"" also delved into the lives of fictitious teens on murderous rampages. But music is the one medium that seemed almost primed for an interpretation of the day's events. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson weathered speculation that his songs may have influenced the pair of young murderers. He addressed the issue in a Rolling Stone magazine article in 1999. ""When it comes down to who's to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, Colorado, throw a rock and you'll hit someone who's guilty,"" Manson wrote. ""We're the people who sit back and tolerate children owning guns, and we're the ones who tune in and watch the up-to-the-minute details of what they do with them."" The spotlight on Manson didn't discourage other artists from referencing Columbine in their songs, music videos and lyrics. Genres from rock to rap reflected on the tragedy. Manson himself released an album titled ""Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)"" that contained songs alluding to the massacre. In the single ""The Nobodies,"" Manson appeared to reiterate statements from his first-person piece in Rolling Stone with the lyrics ""Some children died the other day, We fed machines and then we prayed, Puked up and down in morbid faith,You should have seen the ratings that day."" Music, TV and film were not the only media that reacted to the shootings. In 2005, an independent video game developer released ""Super Columbine Massacre RPG!,"" a role-playing game that allowed users to imagine themselves as the Columbine gunmen and act out the violence. Scott Steinberg, publisher of DigitalTrends.com, said the game is not indicative of the game market as a whole. He pointed out that that 85 percent of video games are rated ""E for everyone"" ""E10 plus"" or ""T for Teen."" Fewer violent video games are being produced today, Steinberg said, despite the perception that the industry mostly produces ""spray and slay"" entertainment. ""The industry is becoming a lot more sensitive in realizing that we have a medium that reaches more people than ever,"" Steinberg said. iReport.com: How did Columbine affect you? Littleton, Colorado, was also very much on the mind of bestselling author Jodi Picoult when she came up with the idea for her popular 2007 novel ""Nineteen Minutes."" ""I have three children and I was watching all of them, at different points in their school careers, being bullied,"" she said. ""It got me wondering why, in a post- Columbine world, we haven't figured this out yet."" Picoult's novel told the story of a bullied, alienated high school student who commits an act of violence. Records have since been released disputing that Klebold and Harris were outcasts or the targets of bullying. Picoult said it was powerful for her to speak with Columbine survivors. She received a standing ovation from families in Littleton during a book event held there. ""It was really moving,"" she said. ""You realize that the people who want to talk about it the most are the people who lived through it. The one thing I think we have learned, and the one thing I thing pop culture is good for, is the more that we see it pop up, the more we are reminded that this is a worthy subject.""","Columbine tragedy provided fodder for several creative works .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in awarding an overdue posthumous Medal of Honor to a Vietnam hero Wednesday, paid tribute to soldiers who received a cold reception when they returned home from the Southeast Asian war. ""This month, we'll begin to mark the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War,"" Obama said at the White House ceremony. ""A time when, to our shame, the soldiers didn't receive the respect and the thanks that they deserve. A mistake that must never be repeated."" Obama, who presented Army Spc. Leslie Sabo Jr.'s medal to his widow, Rose Mary Sabo Brown, singled out Sabo's 101st Airborne Division unit, Bravo Company, as typifying selfless and patriotic service by Vietnam veterans. One woman's persistence to honor military heroes . ""You did your job, you served with honor, you made us proud and, as Les would have wanted it, I ask members of Bravo Company to stand and accept the gratitude of our nation,"" the president said. Transcript: Obama's remarks at Medal of Honor ceremony . A long applause accompanied the recognition. Sabo, of Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, was killed May 10, 1970, in Cambodia. But it wasn't until 1999, when a 101st Airborne veteran was doing research at the National Archives, did the box with Sabo's Medal of Honor paperwork surface. That set the wheels in motion for Wednesday's eventual honor. Four decades later, Medal of Honor for newlywed hero's sacrifice . ""Today, 42 years after that sacrifice, we are setting the record straight,"" Obama said. ""This story was almost lost to history."" He and Brown paid tribute to that researcher, Alton Mabb. Overheard on CNN.com: Who deserves a Medal of Honor? Brown, speaking after the ceremony, said the seven other men who died in the ambush should also be remembered as heroes. ""I know a piece of cloth and a medal won't bring him back,"" she said. ""But my heart beams with pride for Leslie because he is finally receiving tribute for his sacrifices and bravery."" Living Marine gets Medal of Honor for bravery in Afghanistan . Sabo's heroism, near the Se San River in Cambodia, is documented by the Department of Defense: . ""Even though his platoon was ambushed from all sides by a large enemy force, Sabo charged the enemy position, killing several enemy soldiers. He then assaulted an enemy flanking force, successfully drawing their fire away from friendly soldiers and ultimately forcing the enemy to retreat. While securing a resupply of ammunition, an enemy grenade landed nearby. Specialist Sabo picked it up, threw it, and shielded a wounded comrade with his own body -- absorbing the brunt of the blast and saving his comrade's life. ""Although wounded by the grenade blast, Sabo continued to charge the enemy's bunker. After receiving several serious wounds from automatic weapons fire, he crawled toward the enemy emplacement and, when in position, threw a grenade into the bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy fire, but also ended Specialist Sabo's life."" The Medal of Honor: What is it? Sabo was born in Europe to a family of Hungarian refugees. He and his bride spent just 30 days together in the fall of 1969 before he shipped out. ""We only had that one month together as a married couple,"" Brown said. ""He left for Vietnam, and I never saw him again."" Obama, before bestowing the award, provided details of Sabo's sacrifice. ""He saved his comrades, who meant more to him than life."" Are you a veteran? Who was a hero in your unit, or what kind of heroic action have you witnessed? Please share in the comments below.

"JEJU, South Korea (CNN) -- Word: Geese Father . Fireworks mark the groundbreaking for the Jeju Global Education City in Jeju, South Korea, last week. Definition: A father who sends his wife and kids abroad to study English and only flies to see them during winter and summer vacations. Word: Eagle Father . Definition: A geese father who is rich enough so he can swoop in to see his family any time he wants. Word: Penguin Father . Definition: A geese father who is too poor to fly. He can only yearningly gaze into the direction of his family. With a big bang, the groundbreaking for an ambitious new project on the South Korean island of Jeju got under way last week, a project that hopes to make these ""geese"" nouns obsolete. The central idea is relatively simple. More than US $1.3 billion will be poured into creating a city where elementary schools, middle and high schools, and ultimately universities, will be taught almost entirely in English. Top-notch schools outside of South Korea are jumping in, one of the first being Britain's North London Collegiate School. And while the location will be in Jeju, organizers say the curriculum, except for Korean language and history, will all be taught in English and be identical to that being taught at the institute's headquarters. More than 9,000 students are expected to participate. Officially, English is taught from the third grade here. But many Koreans believe in an early start. There are even popular Internet sites that offer recorded English language songs and stories for the fetus. There is also an overwhelming belief that the English taught in the public school system is not good enough. Even that the vast number of English private institutes are not up to par. That leaves many South Korean parents little choice but to send their children overseas. Official statistics say that as of 2007, more than 27,000 South Korean high, middle and even elementary school students were studying abroad. A government survey done last year says nearly half of all South Korean parents wanted to send their children abroad. One such parent was National Assemblyman Song Young-Gil, who made one of the opening speeches at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Jeju Global Education City. Because he represented a neighborhood in Seoul, Song could not send his children overseas without seeming to abandon his voter base. ""I always felt guilty because my children were not getting the English education that other people were getting because of me."" He also saw how the geese father phenomenon was breaking up families, and creating social problems. There have been many media reports about divorces, and even suicides among the lonely fathers. So when the government of Jeju Island asked him to support their project, Song said he gladly said yes. Jeju officials say the tuition will be somewhere between US$3,100 to US$4,700. About half the amount South Korean parents would be paying to send their children overseas. But Jeju is eying something bigger than just the Korean market. The future vision is targeting the entire northeast Asian population: Japanese and Chinese as well as South Korean children. ""Potentially there are 750 million people that live within a two-hour flight time radius of Jeju,"" says Christopher Bogden, the project manager for the Jeju Global Education City. Jeju is already a popular destination for Japanese and Chinese tourists. The tropical climate and natural beauty of the island is a major draw. And the island has recently attracted foreign investors who are seeking to cultivate the island's assets. But the project also has some worried. The lucrative English language market in Korea has already resulted in a total of 21 ""English villages"" across the country. And more are popping up. Next month, an English village capable of schooling some 5,000 children will open in the southern city of Keoje. The concern is that the Jeju project will become just ""one of the many."" And that it will be difficult for the provincial government to recoup their investment, especially in this slow global economy. But the Jeju officials are confident that the project will distinguish itself because it encompasses not just schools, but residential and commercial facilities, all using English language to enhance the immersion experience. The first stage -- comprising one each of an elementary, middle and high school -- will be ready to accept students from 2011, and the entire complex is scheduled to be complete in 2015. Organizers say that will be more than enough time for the global economy to recover and the demand for quality English education in Asia to flourish. That's good news for all geese fathers in South Korea.","More than $1.3 billion will be spent into creating city where English will be taught .

"(CNN) -- It's always funny to get tweets and e-mails from followers of radio entertainer Rush Limbaugh. None of them ever actually think of checking the facts out before they begin their ignorant, vile and rambling rants. I suppose that's to be expected because all they are doing is following their feckless leader, Limbaugh. Last week I took to Twitter to express my disgust with the racist tweets sent to Joel Ward, the Washington Capitals forward who scored the game-winning goal against the Boston Bruins in the pivotal Game 7 of their first round matchup. Ward, who is black, should have been praised for great play. Instead, he was insulted, ridiculed and called the N-word. As a result, I sent out the following tweets: . -- ""It's no shock that a black hockey player is being called nasty vicious things for a game winning goal. Only folks in denial about racism are. -- ""The reality is that weak-minded punks hide behind anonymous comments on message boards AND social media. -- ""I had my arms crossed one day in an editorial meeting and was called ""intimidating"" & ""threatening."" Thinking While Black, huh? LOL . -- ""I simply accept the reality that racism is in the DNA of America. And when that button is pushed, the true feelings come tumbling out! -- ""Trust me, I know the inherent bigotry in 'we want our country back' and 'he's not like us' or 'you have a different worldview.'"" -- ""Why do I love a changing America? Because the walls are tumbling down! One of the last bastions? Media. Some folks are still holding on!"" -- ""Sports is great because talent ain't subjective. It's clear. You win or lose. I know from media history/experience that talent is irrelevant"" -- ""So to all of the soft/hard bigots, we ain't going anywhere. Keep hatin, we'll keep on fighting & winning. But do know we know who you are!"" Limbaugh was apprised of what I tweeted, so when a young listener called in, he brought up what I wrote and said: . ""Roland Martin is a friend of Obama's and here is his Tweet: 'I simply accept the reality that racism is in the DNA of America and when that button is pushed the true feelings come tumbling out.' ""You asked me about racism and the media; well, here is a black journalist at CNN. I don't know what this is relating to but again Paul, 'I simply accept the reality racism is in the DNA of America.' So here is a mainstream journalist who just lives with the assumption that this is a racist country. Always there. And in his case is first because he's black, but he's liberal first. ""All liberals are liberals before they're anything else, if they're Jewish, if they're gay, female, male, they're liberals first, Paul. That is their religion. And that religion requires loyalty. You must have faith in them. They are the equivalent of your higher power. You must trust them; you must let them manage your affairs. This guy tweeting today that racism is in the DNA of America, so we are as a country founded in a flawed, sinful way. We are unjust as a country, it's immoral as a country, and that belief allows Mr. Martin excuse to be able to have power over people, to be able to punish people he thinks are racist."" Here is the key phrase out of all of the nonsense Rush spewed: ""I don't know what this is relating to."" Had Rush and his crack research team bothered to get the context -- is that a bad disease going around lately? -- he would have realized that I was speaking about the racial slurs against the black hockey player. That's when all of the knuckleheads began to write me, and many said that I was inciting the issue by even bringing it up. Several suggested that by ignoring racism, all will be well and it will just go away. Really? Is that how it works? Look, there is no need for Americans to stop living in denial. Race has been in the DNA of America since its founding. Slavery. Formation of our precious U.S. Constitution. The Civil War. Reconstruction. Jim Crow. The turbulence of the Civil Rights Movement. Integration. Busing. Pick the subject and we've had to contend with the issue of race. I was only speaking truthfully to what so many Americans love to ignore. But hey, don't believe me. Here is what Republican star and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had to say about race in America on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" in 2011: . ""It is a birth defect with which this country was born out of slavery; we're never really going to be race blind. I think it goes back to whether or not race and class -- that is, race and poverty -- is not becoming even more of a constraint. ""Because with the failing public schools, I worry that the way that my grandparents got out of poverty, the way that my parents became educated, is just not going to be there for a whole bunch of kids. And I do think that race and poverty is still a terrible witch's brew."" Earlier she discussed the advancements of African-Americans in the U.S. -- whether it's a CEO or president of the United States -- yet even she concluded that ""we're never going to erase race as a factor in American life."" So I say DNA. Rice says birth defect. Hmmm, is it really that different? Ignoring racism will do nothing to solve the problem. Calling it out, speaking against it and educating others is what's important. I find it hilarious that as an African-American, I'm told to ignore racism. I couldn't imagine telling someone Jewish, ""anti-Semitism isn't a big deal! Stop harping on it. It'll disappear."" The problem for too many of us is that we live in a world of denial. We choose not to confront the problem because that means looking inward and confronting how we were raised; what our parents taught us; or even having to check out friends for their bigotry. Racism isn't just black or white. It can be a two-way street between any groups. I prefer to not be silent about it and call it out. Have I experienced racism in my life, as well as in the media? Of course! Sure, I grow tired of having to fight battles that should have been long gone, but it is what it is. So Rush, I'm not going anywhere. I won't back down. I won't surrender. And when racism rears its ugly head, I'll be right there standing up for righteousness and to rid our world of this wretched evil. Got it? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin .","Roland Martin responded to racist reaction to Joel Ward's game-winning NHL goal .
On his radio show, Limbaugh veered off one Martin tweet to a soliloquy about liberals and race .
Martin: Limbaugh didn't even bother to note what the issue was before ranting .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The attorney representing two men suing John Travolta for alleged groping apologized Friday to Travolta's attorney for how one of the plaintiffs was wrong about the date of one alleged attack. That plaintiff, identified as John Doe No. 1, will remain in the federal lawsuit but will be represented by a different lawyer, attorney Okorie Okorocha told CNN. Travolta's attorney, Martin Singer, has said the actor denies the lawsuit's allegations that he groped two massage therapists while on their massage tables. The suit seeks $2 million in damages for each plaintiff. ""I want to apologize to Martin Singer. It must be very upsetting,"" Okorocha told CNN about how John Doe No. 1 provided the wrong date of January 16 for an alleged groping incident in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ""I believed I was on solid ground or I wouldn't have given the dates on any court papers or to Mr. Singer,"" said Okorocha, an attorney based in Pasadena, California. John Doe No. 1 ""needs a fresh lawyer to handle the case and we're working on that,"" Okorocha said. ""He needs someone to handle the case who hasn't made any mistakes."" The current petition will be amended once the new lawyer is hired for John Doe No. 1, and that lawyer would rewrite the section relating to that client, Okorocha said. John Doe No. 2 will still be represented by Okorocha and remain on the same lawsuit, the attorney said. This week, Travolta's lawyer argued a time-stamped photograph and a restaurant receipt show the actor was not in Los Angeles when John Doe No. 1 claimed the actor assaulted him. The plaintiffs are identified in court filings only as John Doe No. 1 from Texas and John Doe No. 2 of Atlanta, a move their lawyer says is allowed by federal law to protect victims. Travolta's lawyers know their names, Okorocha said. Singer said that Okorocha filed his clients anonymously to keep other people from recognizing them and coming forward with evidence against them. Travolta, 58, has been married to actress Kelly Preston for 20 years. The oldest of their three children, Jett, was 16 when he died of a seizure while the family was vacationing in the Bahamas in January 2009. Okorocha said much of his practice is focused on going after sexual predators. He said he is not intimidated by the prospect of going against Singer, a veteran lawyer known for aggressive tactics in his representation of ""A-list"" Hollywood clients. But Singer came out swinging against Okorocha this week, first questioning the suit's detailed description of the first incident in which Travolta allegedly groped John Doe No. 1 repeatedly and finally masturbated during the two-hour massage session in the Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow. The suit claimed Travolta picked up the plaintiff in a black Lexus SUV and took him to a hotel bungalow where an African-American chef was cooking hamburgers. But Singer said that Travolta ""doesn't have a black chef, doesn't own an SUV or a Lexus. He drives a sedan."" And Travolta was in New York that day to be fitted for his wardrobe for his film ""Killing Seasons,"" Singer said. He arrived in the city on January 15, a day before the alleged assault in Beverly Hills, and remained there at least through the next day, he said. A photograph of Travolta, which Singer said was taken at the New York fitting, bears a digital timestamp of January 16 at 4:30 p.m., although the time zone was not specified. Singer also provided a receipt for a $382 meal at Mr. Chow, a Manhattan restaurant, apparently printed at 11:38 p.m. the same day of the alleged Beverly Hills assault. The merchant copy of the receipt does not include a signature. Earlier this week, Okorocha had stood by John Doe No. 1's account of the alleged January 16 assault. ""My client was sexually assaulted at 10 a.m.,"" Okorocha said this week. ""I can get there on horseback to Mr. Chow's in New York in 12 hours. That's not that remarkable."" He noted that Travolta is a licensed pilot with a private jet. The second plaintiff, who claims a similar encounter with Travolta occurred at an Atlanta hotel where he was a staff massage therapist on January 25, was added to the lawsuit Tuesday. Okorocha said the case should be easy to prove because of documentation that was done soon after the incident. ""He tells his boss, the employees all talk about it. There's e-mails going back and forth about the incident."" Responded Singer this week: ""This second 'anonymous' claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one."" Singer said it was ""obvious"" that Okorocha ""checked media reports that my client was in Atlanta working on a movie"" before filing the second claim about an Atlanta incident, he said. ""However, the claim by Doe No. 2 is just as fabricated as the claim by Doe No. 1,"" Singer said. ""Our client will be fully vindicated in court on both of these absurd and fictional claims."" Unless Travolta accepts an out-of-court settlement, the actor can expect to testify in public and on camera about the allegations, Okorocha said this week. ""He's going to have a videotaped deposition with me asking him questions and if he goes to trial he is going be on the witness stand answering my questions,"" Okorocha said. ""That is far more intensive and productive as far as evidence than any police report will ever be."" The lawsuit alleges that Travolta called the first plaintiff, who advertises online with ""professionally themed ads,"" to arrange for a massage at $200 an hour. Travolta picked him up at a Beverly Hills address and drove him to the hotel, according to the lawsuit. When they entered the bungalow, Travolta ""shamelessly stripped naked"" in front of a professional chef and the plaintiff, the lawsuit states. ""For the first hour the massage was without incident, other than he kept purposefully sliding the towel down that covered his buttocks to reveal about half of gluteus area,"" the suit states. The massage therapist repeatedly slid the towel back up 10 times in the first hour, ""reminding Defendant that state law required that a massage client be fully draped during the massage,"" the suit states. When Travolta ""started to rub Plaintiff's leg,"" he ""thought it was accidental,"" it said. Later, however, there was more touching by Travolta ""and this time Plaintiff told Defendant to please not touch him again,"" the complaint said. ""Defendant apologized, but then snickered to himself like a mischievous child,"" it said. The lawsuit then described Travolta allegedly touching and grabbing the massage therapist's penis. ""This was painful and uncomfortable,"" the suit said. Travolta apologized and suggested they ""must have gotten our signals crossed,"" and that he thought that the massage therapist ""wanted the same thing he did,"" it said. ""Defendant then tried to act like it was a simple misunderstanding."" Travolta then asked him to switch places on the table for a ""reverse massage,"" the lawsuit states. Travolta allegedly offered to perform a sexual act on the therapist. Although the therapist ""felt very afraid for his safety,"" he agreed to stay and continue with the massage after Travolta told him ""OK, I'll behave myself,"" the suit said. Travolta's statement ""gave plaintiff confidence that his predatory behavior was finally under control,"" the suit said. When he resumed with a deep tissue massage on his shoulders, Travolta told him, ""Say something nice to me,"" it said. Travolta, who allegedly began masturbating, then got up and screamed at the plaintiff ""how selfish he was; that Defendant got where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his 'Welcome Back Kotter' days,"" the suit said. Hollywood is controlled by homosexual men ""who expect favors in return for sexual activity,"" the lawsuit document quotes Travolta as saying. ""Defendant then went on to say how he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up,"" it said. The complaint said Travolta told the therapist that ""he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it, and when he began to make millions of dollars, that it all became well worth it."" When the therapist refused to take part, Travolta said, ""No problem. I will find new friends,"" the suit said. He then offered to call a ""Hollywood starlet"" who wanted ""three-way sex,"" but ""they needed to have sex together first before calling her, so this way they would be in-sync with each other sexually,"" the suit said. The actor told him he could ""make millions and be famous"" if he lost some weight and adapted to same-sex relations, the suit said. When the therapist threatened to call police if he was not returned to where he was picked up, Travolta drove him back, although calling him ""selfish"" and a ""loser"" on the way, it said. He paid the therapist $800, double the $400 owed for the two hours, the suit said. CNN's Carolyn Sung and Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.","The attorney who filed a sex suit apologizes to John Travolta's attorney .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people are planning viewing parties for the upcoming annular solar eclipse, a rare event in which the sun will appear as a thin ring behind the moon. The eclipse will begin over Asia on Monday morning, when it will be visible in southern Japan and southern China. In the United States, the eclipse will be visible on a path from northwestern Texas through New Mexico, northeastern Arizona, southern Utah, Nevada, northern California and southwestern Oregon late Sunday. ""I recommend anyone who has the chance to see this, because while they do happen occasionally, it's a fairly rare event,"" said Jeffrey Newmark, a solar physics specialist with NASA. ""It's a neat thing to see."" During an annular eclipse, the moon does not block the entirety of the sun, but leaves a bright ring of visible light at the edges, according to NASA. ""For the May eclipse, the moon will be at the furthest distance from Earth that it ever achieves -- meaning that it will block the smallest possible portion of the sun, and leave the largest possible bright ring around the outside,"" the agency said on its website. The last annular eclipse appeared in the United States in 1994. The next solar eclipse will be on November 13, and is expected to be visible over northern Australia, according to NASA. In western United States, more than 1,000 people may flood the small town of Kanarraville, Utah -- population 300 -- to get one of the best views of Sunday's event, said Bonnie Char, spokeswoman for the Cedar City-Brian Head Tourism Bureau. The town is calling the eclipse ""the ring of fire."" The Brian Head Resort in Utah is opening its ski lift so people can watch the eclipse from atop a mountain peak of more than 11,000 feet. For $8, visitors will get a ride up the mountain and solar glasses, Char said. And instead of football fans, the University of Colorado Boulder's Folsom Field will be occupied by astronomy enthusiasts on Sunday. ""In order to provide the best viewing angles, attendance for the event is limited to 13,000 inside the stadium,"" the university said on its website. The whole eclipse will last for a couple of hours as the moon passes in front of the sun, creating a partial eclipse. The actual annular portion, in which the sun appears as a thin ring, will be about four minutes long, Newmark said. More than 80% of the sun will be blocked out during the apex, he said. Outside of the eclipse's narrow path of less than 200 feet (61 meters), people will be able to see only a partial eclipse. ""This will cause less change in the daylight than you might think,"" said Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine. ""Moderately thin clouds would dim the sunlight more. And if you're where the eclipse is only partial, the dimming will be less."" Newmark said people should not peer up at the sky to view the solar event without special viewing equipment. Looking at the sun with the naked eye can cause blindness. Eclipse glasses, dark welder's goggles or an astronomer's filter made for sun viewing are recommended if people want to look skyward. Another way to view the eclipse is by using binoculars and telescopes to project an image of it on the ground, Newmark said. Point the binoculars or telescopes at the sun -- without looking through the lenses -- and aim the other end onto a piece of paper or cardboard. In northern Utah, ""ecliptomaniacs"" are planning to travel south to view the event, said Patrick Wiggins, a NASA ambassador in Salt Lake City. He said astronomy club members ""realize they could either drive four hours to see the eclipse or wait 11 years for the next one."" Wiggins said he always looks forward to seeing people's reactions to an eclipse. ""You get everything from stoic, staring into the sky ... to people breaking down and crying, they're just so moved,"" he said. Planning to view the eclipse?

"(CNN) -- Traveling with young children is an imperfect art. Sure, there are urban myths about parents who tour Europe with their silent, serene baby in an organic backpack. But that's just folklore peddled by luxury retailers selling couture children's clothing. Real kids are loud, smelly and fidgety. Traveling only ups the ante. Exhibit A: The Brangelina brood traipsing through an airport. If that glamorous couple can't mask the hot mess of family travel, what hope is there for the rest of us? Maybe the answer lies in embracing the messiness. It's what the Japanese call 'wabi sabi,' a perspective that celebrates the imperfect, the impermanent and the incomplete. It's an apt metaphor for modern American family life, especially when you're planning spring break on the road with young children. Regardless of your destination, there are three critical factors that help soften the sometimes harsh realities of spending quality family time together. The ""Big Three"" virtually guarantee a good time for the little ones and relative peace of mind for parents: a hotel with an indoor pool, free breakfast with a do-it-yourself waffle maker and access to OnDemand cartoons. When stripped to these bare essentials, family vacationing morphs from the frenzy of plotting the perfect escape to enjoying a simpler and more satisfying adventure. Who says you can't create your best family memories over free food and drink at a hotel happy hour? Just consider the $100 tab to feed a family of four at a big-name amusement park and the beauty of a 'wabi sabi' vacation comes into clearer focus. The next step to a more mindful -- not to mention budget friendly -- family trip is to look local. Here in the Southeast, Disney World reigns supreme, but there are other regional gems worth a second look. Two to consider are Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Huntsville, Alabama. CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee . Scenic City USA . Nicknamed the scenic city, Chattanooga, Tennessee, lives up to its billing. Perched invitingly on the banks of the Tennessee River, the city offers abundant natural attractions, including whitewater rafting, hiking and hang gliding. More surprising, perhaps, is Chattanooga's rich cultural scene, including the Hunter Museum of Art and the historic Bluff View Art District. With literally dozens of attractions packed along the city's downtown riverfront alone, it's little wonder Chattanooga was named one of the country's top places to travel in 2012 by The New York Times. Narrowing down the list of family-friendly attractions can be difficult. Here's a kid-centered cheat sheet to help: . Where to go . Creative Discovery Museum. This three-story, hands-on museum will delight young children. Fronted by a 2 Â½ story river-play area, complete with ceiling-high climbing structures, working water cannons and a lock-and-dam system, the museum also houses a series of interactive art, music and theater exhibits. Budding scientists take heart. There's also an inventor's clubhouse for aspiring engineers and an excavation station for digging up dinosaur bones. Tennessee Aquarium. Somehow, aquariums just seem better in cities defined by their proximity to water (sorry, Atlanta), and so it is with Chattanooga's Tennessee Aquarium. Sure, the kids will love the ocean-themed wing of this double-sided attraction, with its friendly penguins and imposing sharks, but the river-side exhibit is a wonder, too. Giant catfish, river otters and alligators roam the exhibits, offering plenty of opportunities to get lost in the dimly lit corridors of the freshwater building. No matter where you start, there are plenty of spots to dip little fingers in icy water and delight in the slimy creatures that swim by. Ruby Falls. Modern childhood is a torrent of gadgetry and engrossing virtual reality, but at Ruby Falls there are no electronic escapes, there's something better: marvel-worthy natural wonders. Traveling from Chicago on a recent Disney-bound trip, Yuji Tamura, 32, was eager to see what he'd heard described as one of the ""100 things to see before you die."" ""It didn't disappoint,"" Tamura said. (His 11-year-old son Christian agreed, although he wasn't willing to rate it better than the Magic Kingdom. Still, points for Mother Nature!) Situated 1,120 feet below the surface of Lookout Mountain (think of an inverted Empire State building and you get a sense of the depth), Ruby Falls is actually a series of caves leading to a stunning 145-foot waterfall named after the wife of Leo Lambert, the chemist and cave enthusiast who made the original 17-hour round-trip trek (mostly wriggling on his stomach) to view the falls. Today, it's an easy round-trip walk (less than a mile, upright). One caveat: there are no strollers allowed so be prepared to carry younger kids or distract them by throwing pennies into the countless underground pools along the guided path. Family-friendly restaurants . When to go . During March and April the city plays host to a spring break safari, with special behind-the-scenes tours such as the keeper kids program at the Tennessee Aquarium and the junior explorer's scavenger hunt at Rock City gardens. Many local hotels, including the Doubletree and the Chattanoogan, offer spring break promotions that include bundled room and attraction rates through April. In June, families can head to the banks of the Tennessee River for Chattanooga's nine-day Riverbend music festival. Featuring five stages with more than 100 bands, the festival also has a children's village, interactive exhibits and marketplace. This year's headliners include The Band Perry, Eric Church and Lauren Alaina. General admission is $40; kids 10 and under are free. HUNTSVILLE, Alabama . Rocket City is worth the ride . What's more Southern than German rocket scientists and the smell of frying wiener schnitzel? In Huntsville, Alabama, the answer's not much. Known as rocket city, modern Huntsville retains its antebellum aura (the National Trust even named it one of America's ""distinctive destinations""), but the city's skyline is defined by the Saturn V rockets developed there in the 1960s. Led by Wernher von Braun and his team of German rocket scientists (spirited into the United States after WWII through a covert CIA effort codenamed ""operation paper clip""), this team of former Axis-allied scientists paved the way for modern American space flight. Today, their legacy can be felt everywhere from the city's convention center (named the Von Braun Center) to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, which Von Braun helped establish. If you're lucky, museum volunteer Dr. Georg von Tiesenhausen, an original member of Von Braun's team, will be on hand to provide a firsthand account of the heady days of America's race to the moon. What to do . U.S. Space and Rocket Center. The centerpiece of this sprawling space oasis is the 68,000-square-foot Davidson Center, housing an original Saturn V rocket, an Apollo cockpit trainer and a 67-foot curved-screen IMAX theater featuring five daily showings. Outside, kids can explore numerous rockets up close; experience a simulated space launch (for those under 54 inches, there's a mini-version in the cosmos play area); and stomp around a faux lunar crater. If you're planning to make a day of it, pack a lunch and picnic in space shuttle park. The perfect follow-up? A week spent at the center's famous space camp. EarlyWorks Children's History Museum. This charming, mid-sized children's museum welcomes visitors under a canopy of 8,000 fabric leaves that comprise a sprawling imitation evergreen in the museum's atrium. Inside, this hands-on learning space is packed with fun features, including a replica blasting exhibit (complete with dry ice) that teaches kids about local mining history; a 19th-century general store; and a special space for infants and young children to safely explore. If you have extra energy, the Huntsville Museum of Art is across the street, and kids 6 and under are free. Huntsville Botanical Garden. Located just a mile from the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, this 100-acre natural retreat is a world away from the high-tech wonders of aerospace engineering. Kids will enjoy the two-acre children's garden and mini-railroad. (The open-air Bridge Street shopping center is also nearby and has a kids' carousel and gondola rides.) Kid-friendly eateries . When to go . Summer in the south can be brutal, so it's better to go during the explosion of color that defines Dixie in the springtime. During April, the Huntsville Botanical Garden hosts its annual festival of flowers with thousands of blooming dogwoods and azaleas on display, with average temperatures topping out at just 75 degrees. Another spring standout in Huntsville is the 19th annual NASA Great Moonbuggy Race, April 13-14, at the Space and Rocket Center. The race pits high school students from around the world against one another in a feat of engineering to see who has the math and science skills to reach the finish line first. No matter where you're headed this spring break, if you go there in the spirit of wabi sabi family fun you're guaranteed to find unexpected delights. What's your approach to family travel?

"Salado, Texas (CNN) -- Dan Wallrath spent 30 years as a homebuilder in Texas, but it wasn't until 2005 that he found his life's work. After helping renovate the home of a young Marine who had been severely wounded in Iraq, Wallrath realized there were thousands of other injured war veterans who needed a hand. So he decided to help them by doing what he knew best -- building homes -- and giving them away, mortgage-free. For his efforts, Wallrath was recognized in November as one of the year's top 10 CNN Heroes. The exposure has helped take his organization -- now known as Operation Finally Home -- to the next level. ""It's just been incredible,"" Wallrath said last month. ""We've been getting phone calls and e-mails and donations from all over the world."" Since the airing of ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" Operation Finally Home has received more than $100,000 in contributions -- as well as three pieces of property that will be used for future homes. All told, being honored as a CNN Hero has enabled Wallrath to more than double his impact. So far, his group has completed nine homes, and it has 13 more planned or under construction. The spotlight also led ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" to partner with Wallrath on a special project last month: building a home for one of the victims of the 2009 shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas. ""We had seen Dan on the CNN Heroes tribute, and we thought, 'That's a perfect guy we've got to team up with,' "" said George Verschoor, executive producer of the ABC television show. The home was for Army Staff Sgt. Patrick Zeigler and his fiancée, Jessica Hansen. Zeigler, 29, had just returned from his second tour of duty in Iraq when he was shot four times at Fort Hood, including once in the head. Although doctors had given him only a 5% chance to live -- at one point, Hansen started writing his eulogy -- Zeigler not only survived but learned to walk again. Wallrath said the couple's story and spirit is typical of the families that his group tries to help. ""All of a sudden, their life has been turned upside down. And in spite of their injuries, they're moving forward,"" Wallrath said. ""This is what our program's about. We give (families) a hand up, not a handout. ... They just need a little help in life to get them started."" Usually about 200 people are involved in building a home for Wallrath's group, but more than 4,000 volunteers chipped in to help ""Extreme Makeover"" build Zeigler and Hansen's home in Salado, Texas. Salado is about 30 minutes away from Fort Hood. ""We have tons of military folks coming out and helping us,"" Wallrath said. ""That's one of the reasons this job has gone so well."" It also means the home was completed at warp speed. The 2,800-square foot, three-bedroom, three-bath house was built in just 100 hours. Wallrath's projects normally take about six months. For Zeigler and Hansen, the home means stability and a fresh start. ""It's really exciting to know that so much love and care went into this house,"" Hansen said. ""I think every time we look around, we'll always feel that."" In mid-December, at an event honoring Zeigler and Hansen, Wallrath announced that Operation Finally Home had established a Fort Hood Victims' Fund to help all of the families affected by the attack. The fund will assist with emergency financial needs and home renovations like wheelchair ramps and handicap-accessible bathrooms. ""Now we know that all these families are not going to be forgotten,"" Wallrath said. ""America's going to step up, and we're going to be able to help them."" The ""Extreme Makeover"" episode featuring Wallrath will air February 20, but people can already donate to the fund on Wallrath's website. All in all, it was a breakthrough year for Wallrath and his work. And he's excited about having the chance to help even more people in 2011. ""You know, sometimes I feel selfish because I feel so good all the time about seeing these lives changed,"" he said. ""Now, we're going to be able to change a lot more.""","Dan Wallrath and his group, Operation Finally Home, build houses for injured U.S. veterans .

"(CNN) -- Anne Malver, then 11, thought she was heading to the trophy store with her gymnastics coach. Instead they ended up in his apartment -- and, she said, she ended up naked as he ""forced himself inside of me."" She screamed out -- in pain, and for him to stop. ""He wouldn't,"" she recalled. ""And I'll never forget the words he whispered in my ear at that time: 'This is what you want. This is what all the girls want.'"" Malver is not alone, as several of Doug Boger's ex-elite young gymnasts -- speaking to CNN decades later, now as a group of adults -- detailed similar, graphic allegations of sexual and physical abuse. Besides an initial ""no comment"" in a phone conversation weeks ago, Boger did not return repeated phone calls or e-mails from CNN, nor did he respond to a knock at his door. But in an interview earlier this year with CNN Denver affiliate KCNC, he defiantly insisted that those accusing him are all lying. ""I was not abusive to them,"" said Boger, now in his 60s. ""I didn't do anything wrong."" He was acquitted by a jury in 1982 on child abuse and battery charges, after two young athletes in his Pasadena, California, gym accused him of wrongdoing. The parents of two of the ex-gymnasts who are now alleging abuse by Boger helped finance his defense during that trial. One was the family of Julie Whitman, a star gymnast who was on USA Gymnastics' Junior National Team in 1983-1984, according to that organization's website. She said that Boger ""was somebody that my parents trusted."" Another, Charmaine Carnes, recalled how her father referred to Boger as an ""adoptive son"" in messages sent out to family and friends before Christmas. Her parents did not know, she said, that Boger was physically abusing her -- and how that turned to sexual abuse when she was 8 or 9 years old. ""I would ride with him in a car to a meet,"" Carnes recalled. ""He'd be tickling me at a stoplight or something of that nature, and his hands would reach down and go into my privates."" Some days at the gym, Whitman said, could be ""fantastic, and other days it was kind of a living hell."" The intent was to produce world-class athletes -- like Sabrina Mar, who won the 1985 U.S. Nationals and 1987 Pan American Games all-around titles -- by pushing them to their limits, with the ex-gymnasts claiming Boger sometimes used physical force to make a point and exert his authority. Carnes, for instance, pointed to a cigarette burn on her finger that she said came from Boger. And Mar described how ""he used to grab you by your neck and he would pin you up against the wall. And basically just choke you."" Several remembered Boger standing over them, as they were on all fours -- sometimes kicking them in the stomach, at other times poking them with a toothpick he was known to chew on in his mouth. ""Girls would be sobbing, crying,"" recalled Malver. Boger wasn't Kimberly Evans' coach, though she was a regular at the gym because her sister was one of his students. She remembered being 13 and heading with him to his apartment -- she thought to pick up some equipment, until she felt his hand ""around the back of my neck, really hard"" and she sensed ""something good wasn't going to happen."" ""And I was right,"" Evans said. In a different incident, Kathy Riordan, daughter of former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, recalled seeing a teammate, naked and running out of Boger's bed during one road trip. She told her father, who called the teammate's parents -- only to be told that they ""wanted to keep it quiet."" ""But I did bring Doug Boger down to my office,"" Richard Riordan said. ""And he denied everything."" Most parents had no idea what was happening, partly because they'd signed a waiver that barred them from attending practices. By talking now, these women -- now in their 40s and 50s -- say their main focus is not necessarily to bring more charges against Boger. Rather, they want to make sure that no other girls, from here on out, have similar stories. Whitman began spearheading the effort after, about six years ago, she discovered that Boger was ""still coaching."" ""I just kept seeing his name and seeing his name and I thought to myself, I can't let this man continue coaching,"" a tearful Whitman recalled. In 2008, she contacted USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny, who encouraged her to speak to her former teammates. Several of them ended up writing letters detailing alleged abuse, spurring an official investigation one year later. ""The biggest challenge with this particular case was that it happened 30 years ago and, not only that, he had been acquitted,"" Penny said. Boger maintains some support -- including from Aubree Balkan, whom he coached at the World Championships in 2005, 2007 and 2009. ""I obviously don't want to believe it, but all I can share is the good experience I had,"" said Balkan, adding that she neither witnessed nor experienced abuse. USA Gymnastics concluded its investigation in 2010 by putting Boger on its permanently ineligible coaches list. That means he cannot coach at a USA Gymnastics member gym, though he still can at a non-affiliated gym. And he did just that, at a facility in Colorado Springs owned by a coach once convicted of a sex offense involving a gymnast. ""That really made me angry, made me livid,"" said Mar. ""That someone like that, with such a history of abuse can still be able to coach in this field of gymnastics."" Today, Balkan says that Boger is no longer coaching -- adding that, with that, she's not sure what his critics are trying to accomplish. But his accusers say that's not the point. ""This is about a group of women who want no more harm coming to any children for the sake of becoming a competitive athlete,"" Malver said. CNN's Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","Women claim gymnastics coach Doug Boger physically, sexually abused them .
They decided to speak now, decades later, hoping that he won't coach again .
He did not respond to CNN, but has claimed that his accusers are lying ."
"(CNN) -- Emmindingen is a small town in southwest Germany, with about 26,000 people and an enviable unemployment rate of just 2.8% . But barely 20 miles away, across the French border, the picture is very different. The Alsatian town of Selestat has a similar industrial base, but an unemployment rate of 7.4%. Among young people, the contrast is even starker, with 23% of under-25s unemployed in the French town, compared to 1.8% in Emmendingen. The differing fortunes of these neighboring border towns illustrate the complaints of many French businesses, as their country heads towards a presidential election. Anne Leitzgen is the president of SALM Kitchens, a family-run business which has operated since the 1930s, and has one of the largest worktop production lines in Europe. Despite a commitment to invest in Selestat, she worries about the increased costs of running a firm in France, saying taxes are higher, labor is twice as expensive, and workers' benefits are double those paid in Germany. Leitzgen says she is concerned the next French government will tax companies like hers out of business. ""We are afraid money will be taken from our companies, and afraid that taxes will increase a lot and the situation will become bad for companies our size ,"" she says. Further, she says, the ""relationship between the unions is more constructive and easier in Germany."" Across the border is the workplace of Emmanuel Foyer, a Frenchman who lives in his homeland but commutes to work in Emmendingen. Foyer, the sales manager for plastics industry solutions provider Braunform, believes a German focus on the long-term is behind the current success. ""In Germany, for sure, we are thinking of the long-term. In a company like this, [there's a] huge focus on training and the future of our employees,"" he says. ""The approach in Germany to keep workers in times of low-load level means we were ready when the economy restarted."" The trade-off for German workers is less job security, no national, fixed minimum wage, and less extensive social protections for the unemployed. But the mayor of Selestat, Marcel Bauer, says it is time for France to make these changes to regain its economic competitiveness. ""As soon as the next president is in office -- be it the one we've got or a new one -- I sincerely hope that jobs reforms will be put in place immediately,"" he says. ""The system needs to be more flexible. There is a lot that must change, starting with the mindset of employers and employees.""","Two towns either side of the French-German border have contrasting economic fortunes .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A part-time stripper fired from her full-time newspaper job covering Texas high society claims she's a victim of gender discrimination. Sarah Tressler, 30, filed a complaint this week asking the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to investigate the Houston Chronicle's decision to let her go after another paper revealed her second job. Tressler covered high society, general assignments, human interest stories, men's and women's fashion and other stories for the newspaper for two months, Tressler said at a Los Angeles news conference Thursday. But she ""very rarely"" worked as a dancer, a skill that helped her pay for college, she said. ""Sometimes I would just go in for three hours at a time to get a workout in because stage rotation, if you're doing it in 7-inch heels, is a really good way to get a workout in,"" Tressler said. ""And I didn't have a gym membership. So, on days off I might just go in there in the afternoon and do a couple stage rotations and knock it out."" A rival newspaper, tipped off by an online blog titled ""Diary of an Angry Stripper"" she wrote anonymously, published a story about her background in March. She was soon told by an editor that she was fired for not disclosing her dancing experience on her job application, Tressler said. ""There was no question on the form that covered my dancing. I answered the questions on the form honestly."" ""I was very upset that I was fired, because I had been told by many editors that I was doing a good job,"" Tressler said. Gloria Allred, a Beverly Hills lawyer known for championing high-profile cases involving women's rights, is representing her. She called the firing gender discrimination, which is covered by federal law. ""Most exotic dancers are female, and therefore to terminate an employee because they had previously been an exotic dancer would have an adverse impact on women, since it is a female-dominated occupation,"" Allred said. The newspaper management remained mum about Tressler's charge. ""We have not seen the complaint and thus cannot comment,"" Chronicle spokeswoman Naomi Engel said Thursday. Tressler, who has a master's degree in journalism, said that when she decided to dance to pay for college, she didn't think it would keep her from pursuing the career she was trying to build. ""Some young women will use dancing as a way to make ends meet while they study to prepare for the career that they hope to be able to have for the rest of their lives,"" Tressler said. ""These women should not have to live in fear that once they acquire a position in the career that they have worked hard to achieve, that their past work experience as a dancer will jeopardize that position."" She broke no laws by dancing, Allred said, and it ""does not, has not and will not affect her ability to perform her job as a journalist."" Tressler said has already found a new writing job in Houston for a publication she declined to name. She insisted she has no plan to parlay the media attention into a job covering high society in Los Angeles. ""I really like Houston,"" she said.","Woman wants investigation of newspaper's firing of her for not disclosing she stripped .

"(CNN) -- As the U.S. Justice Department sues controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona for alleged civil rights violations against Latinos, his most ardent supporters are wondering whether ""America's Toughest Sheriff' is fighting for his political life. ""It's hard to say at this point,"" said Shane Wikfors, spokesman for the Arizona Republican Party. ""He's done so well with every election cycle he's gone through. He still has tremendous support."" But Latinos in Arizona are a growing political force and demonstrated their clout last year when they led a successful campaign in recalling former state Sen. Russell Pearce, the Republican who authored Arizona's controversial law against illegal immigrants that's now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pearce lost the recall election. ""There's a very vocal Latino faction in the state of Arizona that felt when they were successful with recalling Russell Pearce ... it was enough to put blood in the water to think that, 'Let's go after Sheriff Joe now,'"" Wikfors told CNN. Heightening the political stakes is the fact that Thursday's legal action against Maricopa County and its sheriff is the Justice Department's first lawsuit, in the federal agency's 18-year history in civil police reform work, to stop what it sees as discriminatory and unconstitutional policing. Said Wikfors, ""I will tell you that it's not new for the sheriff to be in a position where you've got the federal government in conflict with him on an issue. He's not a stranger to these types of battles."" Some analysts consider the lawsuit a political maneuver by President Barack Obama's administration. ""Obviously, if this is something unconstitutional, it would have to come to an end, but my fear is that this is political more than anything else,"" said Jon Feere, legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, a self-described ""low-immigration, pro-immigrant"" think tank. ""Clearly the Department of Justice has limited resources when it files lawsuits, but it's going against states that are attempting to uphold immigration law and not filing lawsuits against states and communities with sanctuary policies, which clearly undermine federal law."" Critics say the so-called sanctuary policies protect illegal immigrants. In his 18 years as Maricopa County sheriff, Arpaio gained international notoriety for making prison inmates wear pink underwear and pink handcuffs and housing them in tents. Rather than shy away from controversy, he has embraced it, touting his nickname of ""America's Toughest Sheriff"" on his website and boasting that his inmate meals are the cheapest in the nation, costing between 15 and 40 cents apiece. His cutting out salt and pepper saved taxpayers $20,000 a year, according to his biography on the sheriff's website. Another program Arpaio began posts mugshots of all those arrested -- about 300 daily -- on the sheriff's website as they are booked and processed into jail, according to the biography. The site gets ""just under a million hits daily,"" it said. He has been re-elected to five four-year terms as sheriff since taking office in 1993. But last December, the Justice Department said it had found cause to believe the sheriff's office ""has engaged in a pattern of misconduct that violates the Constitution and federal law"" and, under the leadership of Arpaio, discriminated against Latinos through traffic stops, detentions and arrests and against Latino inmates with limited English proficiency by punishing them and denying them critical services. The Justice Department also found that Arpaio and the sheriff's office engaged in ""a pattern or practice of unlawful retaliatory behavior against perceived critics of (the office) through baseless criminal charges, unfounded civil lawsuits and meritless administrative actions,"" Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez said Thursday. U.S. sues controversial Arizona sheriff . Attempts by the Justice Department to negotiate a settlement with the sheriff's office broke down in February because Arpaio and his department ""would not agree to any settlement that included an independent monitor"" to ensure reforms are carried out, said Perez. The Justice Department was ""left with no choice"" and filed a civil complaint in U.S. District Court against the sheriff, his department and the county. According to Arpaio's website, Maricopa has the nation's third largest sheriff's department, employing more than 3,400 people. During his tenure, the sheriff banned smoking, coffee, movies, pornographic magazines and unrestricted televisions viewing in jails, according to his biography. The jail system's inmates -- between 7,500 and 10,000 -- are fed twice daily to cut down on meal costs. The infamous pink underwear came about when Arpaio had all inmate underwear dyed pink after learning inmates were stealing white boxer shorts, the sheriff's site said. He also ordered pink handcuffs when those began disappearing. Another controversial program: Arpaio's ""chain gangs,"" including the world's first-ever female and juvenile work gangs. The groups clean streets, paint over graffiti and bury the indigent in the county cemetery, providing ""thousands of dollars of free labor to the community,"" the sheriff's office said. ""No wonder Sheriff Arpaio has been profiled in over 4,500 U.S. and foreign newspapers, magazines and TV news programs,"" the office's website said. Arpaio also briefly starred in the FOX reality show, ""Smile: You're Under Arrest."" It featured the sheriff and other officers using elaborate ploys crafted by comedy writers and carried out by professional actors to arrest suspects with outstanding warrants. Arpaio, 79, served in the U.S. Army from 1950 to 1953, and he was a police officer in Washington and Las Vegas before serving as a federal narcotics agent. He ended his Drug Enforcement Administration career as head of that federal agency for Arizona, according to his website. He and his wife have been married for more than 54 years and have four grandchildren. ""Arpaio looks forward to many more years as sheriff of Maricopa County,"" the sheriff's website said.","Arizona's Sheriff Joe Arpaio is sued by the Justice Department for Latino discrimination .

"(CNN) -- Brazil's men's football team are one win away from an historic first Olympic title after a 3-0 defeat of South Korea in Tuesday's semifinal at London 2012. The five-time world champions, who have also won the South American championship on eight occasions, will play Mexico at Wembley Stadium on Saturday in the gold medal match. A brace from striker Leandro Damiao, his fifth and sixth goals of the tournament, followed a first-half effort from defensive midfielder Romulo as Brazil proved too much for spirited South Korea. Mexico booked a place in the weekend showpiece courtesy of a similarly comfortable 3-1 win over Japan, who will contest the bronze medal against their Asian rivals in Cardiff on Friday.

"Chicago (CNN) -- With NATO meeting this week in Chicago to discuss the war in Afghanistan, CNN reached out to some everyday Afghan-Americans to see what they think. What should be the next step? What do they hope will result from the summit? And what is the key to restoring peace after 10 years of bloodshed? Here are five perspectives from Afghans who live in different areas of the Windy City. Nasir Ahmad Raufi owns a restaurant in northwest Chicago. He is from Puli Khumri in northern Afghanistan. ""I was (in Afghanistan) in 2002, 2004, 2007 and just last November. Every year, it gets worse. People are upset, people are suffering. ... Both sides (are) losing life. ""The war is not the solution. There is no way you can win the war by this kind of force. NATO has so many mistakes in Afghanistan. Innocent people died. On the other side, suicide (bombers), innocent people died. We are against that. ""(I'm hopeful), but at this summit I don't think NATO is going to pull out from Afghanistan."" Mohammed Daud Miraki is author of ""Afghanistan After Democracy: The Untold Story Through Photographic Images."" He is from Maidan, Afghanistan, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Kabul. ""(Under NATO), a few roads have been built, no doubt. But come on, these are nothing compared to the $500 billion we supposedly spent in Afghanistan. ""The solution (to the war) is an indigenous peace process. I call it the indigenous peace jurga. These are jurgas at the village level, at the district level, at the province level, at the zonal level all over Afghanistan. They include tribal leaders, they include insurgents and (foreign-educated Afghan expatriates). Let us lead the peace process."" Fazal Ahmedi owns a jewelry store on Chicago's north side. He is from Kandahar City. ""All the companies (NATO) hires, who owns the companies? Americans, Chinese, Indians, Pakistanis. Why don't you hire Afghans? If you want to stop them from war, give them jobs. ... ""My family, we have a lot of kids, no school. We need good schools, we need a system."" Hamid Ahang is a network engineer originally from Kabul. ""There's been certain progress, there are schools built. But at the same time, what they promised was stability and peace. After years of war, they haven't done as promised. ""If NATO pulls out, there will be civil war, there will be anarchy. If they don't, the violence will continue. ""NATO needs to focus on Pakistan, not Afghanistan. Pakistan is where the Taliban came from and where support (for it) comes from. (NATO) needs to have a greater debate that involves regional powers like Pakistan, Iran and Russia, which still has influence."" Sima Quraishi is executive director of the Muslim Women Resource Center, a nonprofit based in Chicago. She is originally from Kabul. ""There is a lot of money floating around (in Afghanistan). However, I believe the money should be spent to help the people of Afghanistan with education/schools, job development, health care and child care. ""It is vital that the people of Afghanistan develop skills and obtain the tools to move past 2014 and work independently toward the betterment of Afghanistan. With the proper funding and tools available to the people, I trust that Afghanistan can improve after 2014 and the lives of innocent Afghans would be spared.""","CNN spoke to Afghan-Americans in Chicago to get their take on the NATO summit .

"(MNN.com) -- Lady Blackthorne was beginning to look spherical. But it took a vet visit for Vryce Hough to take matters into her own hands and help the feline conquer her battle of the bulge. ""I didn't really think about it as a problem, but when the vet started talking about the risk of diabetes, I realized we had to do something,"" Hough says. ""Those are really scary words."" Changing a cat's diet can be risky, so Hough worked with her vet to gradually reduce Lady Blackthorne's daily kibble intake. Unfortunately, there was another challenge to overcome. In a household with three cats, she wanted a way to feed each without setting up separate feeding areas. Hough did a little online research and settled on a high-tech cat door called SureFlap. Like a virtual bouncer, the battery-operated door can be programmed to read your pet's microchip, denying access to unapproved guests. Physicist Nick Hill created the device so that his cat, Flipper, could enjoy the great outdoors, then return home without a gaggle of freeloading feline friends in tow. MNN: Pet gadgets that make life simpler . ""The European market has a strong custom of letting cats come and go freely from the house,"" says Judith Bank, marketing manager for SureFlap. ""The U.S. market has been a very interesting market for us because it's been used in a different way."" U.S. customers like Hough typically use the device on internal doors, opting to separate cats or limit food access.Â AtÂ $139.99, the SureFlap isn't cheap,Â but Hough was willing to give it a try, and contacted the company with her idea. Then, she got handy, purchasing large plastic storage containers and borrowing a spiral saw to cut holes for three new SureFlaps. In about two weeks, her crew adjusted to the new setup, which included a separate container large enough for each cat. Also, the doors currently come in only one size, so Lady Blackthorne had a bit of an issue squeezing through the tight space. ""She had to put her head and front legs through the door, then grab onto something with her claws and literally pull herself through; but she's better now"" Hough says, noting that Lady Blackthorne has dropped the excess baggage. ""We don't have to worry about that anymore.""

"(CNN) -- The United States has a dignity problem. The concept of dignity is recognized by law in countries all over the world. It is a cornerstone of both international humanitarian law, which governs the treatment of prisoners of war, and international human rights law. But it has little power in American jurisprudence. A robust recognition and protection of dignity is precisely what we need, particularly if we are to understand how racism has broken its tether and become enshrined again in state laws and policies across the United States. Take racial profiling -- the single most explicit manifestation of racial prejudice in the United States today. Nearly 700,000 individuals a year are subject to the brutal indignity of the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy. The vast majority are young African-American and Latino men. In a New York Times op-ed in December, 23-year-old Nicholas Peart heart-rendingly described his initiation into the world of stop-and-frisk beginning at age 14. This rite of passage for innocent young black men requires submitting without complaint or question to being harassed and targeted by the police. Even showing an ""attitude"" can escalate encounters into an arrest or even death. Stop-and-frisk policing is only one aspect of the national indignity of racial profiling. Police surveillance of law-abiding Muslims (here again the New York police play a central role) and the pulling over of motorists for ""driving while black"" are two others. Rather than recognize how these practices strike at our bedrock constitutional rights to due process, equal protection and freedom from unreasonable searches, the Supreme Court recently doubled down on racial profiling. It decided that the discretion of police may be complemented by the discretion of jail officials to strip-search the 14 million Americans who are arrested each year. In this way, the conservative majority on the court is turning back the clock on the greatest successes of the civil rights movement -- the understanding that the Civil War amendments to the Constitution were designed to uphold the inherent dignity of blacks as human beings and citizens. Even more alarming and insidious is the court's ability to provide legal support for racial profiling without ever mentioning race. In key, high-profile cases in which racial profiling was either explicitly or implicitly at the core of the complaint, the conservative majority simply ignores the racial implications of sweeping decisions that leave racial minorities subject to arbitrary law enforcement practices. Opinion: A jury's race can deny justice . In 2010 in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, a case brought by a Pakistani man who argued that racial and religious profiling after 9/11 resulted in his arrest and mistreatment in jail in New York, the court raised the standard for complainants in civil cases. It insisted that plaintiffs must show before discovery that their claim appears plausible to a trial judge. The court expressed confidence in the ""common sense and experience"" of trial judges to know a plausible discrimination claim when they hear one. The court also found it implausible that federal law enforcement officials might have engaged in racial profiling after 9/11. In 2011 in Connick v. Thompson, the court held that a black man railroaded by the district attorney's office in New Orleans and convicted of a murder he did not commit could not recover a judgment in a civil rights action he brought and won after serving 14 years on death row. Just a month ago in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, the court held that jail officials were legally entitled to strip-search an African-American businessman, Albert Florence, twice after he was wrongly arrested and held for a week in two New Jersey jails. In each case, the conservative majority never once addressed the racial context or racial implications of their decisions. The court appears poised to do the same next month in the case involving Arizona immigration law, which gives local police the right to demand proof of citizenship from people they suspect are here illegally. This is at bottom a license for nationwide racial profiling under the guise of immigration enforcement and state's rights. Perhaps this is why Chief Justice John Roberts insisted on limiting the parameters of the case by stating at the outset of the solicitor general's argument, ""I'd like to clear up what (this case is) not about. No part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling."" The meek acquiescence of the solicitor general to this judicial bullying was a failure of colossal proportions. The conservative majority may have the power to legalize racial profiling in this country, but they should not be permitted to pretend that this is not precisely what they are doing. This is precisely why we need a more robust and coherent understanding of how the concept of dignity underlies key provisions of our Constitution. Although the Constitution does not include an explicit right to dignity, as one scholar has recently explained, the Supreme Court has long invoked dignity interests in its decisions. Civil rights lawyers, scholars and activists need to remind the court and our nation about the centrality of dignity to our core constitutional protections. Without this understanding, this court will continue unchecked until racial minorities in this country find themselves once again in a posture of abject indignity before the irrational policies of the state. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sherrilyn A. Ifill.","Sherrilyn Ifill: Recognition of dignity crucial to grasping how racism cropping up in laws .
Ifill: Examples of profiling include stop-and-frisk policy, post-9/11 Muslim surveillance .

"(CNN) -- On New Year's Day, Windy Hill lay in a hospital bed and described to her doctor the feeling she'd been having. Her heart, she told him, felt like it was in a vise grip. Hill described the sensation -- which had come and gone for weeks after she had a baby girl -- like being ""punched in the chest."" Yet none of the tests performed on her heart indicated a problem. ""The doctor turned to me and said, 'Seems like she's OK. I think it was just a panic attack,'"" said Joseph Berry, Hill's fiancÃ©. ""He walked out of the room, was gone four or five minutes and I looked over and she had lost all color in her face."" ""She says, 'It's happening again. I'm hurting,'"" Berry said. ""I don't remember anything after that,"" Hill, 38, said recently. Her doctors suspect that Hill's history of high blood pressure caught up with her, causing the left hemisphere of her heart to buckle and tear, starving a large portion of her heart of blood. ""That whole portion of the heart died,"" said Dr. Rashid Ahmad, an assistant professor of cardiac surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where Hill was transferred after her heart attack. ""She was teetering on the edge. Her heart wasn't going to recover."" To try to restore blood flow, doctors performed a bypass. When that did not work, Hill was told she needed a transplant. More evidence links calcium supplements to heart attacks . But because the wait for a matching donor heart could take months, maybe years, doctors offered a temporary solution: a heart pump to keep her alive in the interim. It was as Hill lay on the operating room table in April -- under anesthesia, ready to receive the pump, tubes and monitoring lines all in place -- that a miracle happened. ""We're prepping for surgery, which means in about 20 minutes I would have made a skin incision,"" said Ahmad, one of Hill's surgeons. ""My cell phone rings and it's the transplant coordinator. A donor heart was identified."" The operating room staff was stunned. ""I've been doing this for about 10 years and this is very rare, a first for me,"" Ahmad said. ""And the timing of it. I could have gotten the call after making the incision, which would have made things much more difficult.""With Hill still under anesthesia, Ahmad went to Berry, her fiancÃ©, to deliver the news. ""I told him, the good news is we located a heart,"" Ahmad said. But there was a catch: ""We want to be really sure this heart won't be immediately rejected."" The odds favored rejection. Windy had just had baby Gracie six months earlier, and antibodies still circulating in her blood would almost certainly attack the donor heart. But Berry said they had prayed for a heart, and he believed this would be a match. ""I was very excited, holding my breath,"" he said. He waited several hours while doctors cross-matched a blood sample from Hill with the new heart, to find out if implanting it would result in rejection. Against the odds, tests indicated that Hill's body would accept the donor heart. Later that evening, surgeons implanted the new heart into Hill. ""You know like when you're a kid at Christmas and couldn't wait to see what was under the tree?"" said Berry about waiting for Hill to wake up so that he could deliver the good news. ""It's like that feeling times a thousand."" Berry was by her side as Hill's eyes tentatively blinked open two days after surgery. He delivered the news that instead of a pump, she had gotten a new heart. ""She just looked at me for a minute. I said 'You hear me?'"" said Berry. ""She looked at me again, her eyes got real big and she was moving her lips. She said, 'No I didn't.' I said, 'Yes you did.'"" ""I didn't believe him at first,"" said Hill, who then began reaching around to find the pump console. When she could not find it, ""That's when I realized I had a heart."" ""She looked at me and started crying,"" Berry said. Hill had spent a good portion of her daughter's life in the hospital. The new heart, she said, means making up for lost time, getting to know her newborn. Berry said he owes a debt of gratitude to the organ donor for helping to keep his family intact. ""They gave me and Gracie a second chance with Windy,"" said an emotional Berry. ""Our little girl gets to grow up with her mama. It's a miracle of life.""","Windy Hill had frequent heart pains after her baby girl was born .

"(CNN) -- I was watching yet another annoying political ad produced by some super PAC of which I've never heard, and all I could think was: ""Sheesh, it's not even June, and I'm already sick of this stuff. With five months to go until the election, I think a steady diet of this junk will drive me into a mental institution."" Me and about 200 million other Americans. Let's face it -- the way we elect our presidents is seriously dysfunctional. The seemingly endless campaign season. The hectoring TV ads, the hundreds of millions of dollars poured into the system, the endless polling and pontificating. Contemplating this, all I can do is repeat the immortal words of Charlton Heston in ""Planet of the Apes"": ""God damn you all to hell!"" But there are ways to make the system better. If, that is, we have the will (and this is highly questionable). I'm no pundit; heck, I'm not even Joe the Plumber (think of me as Lew the Disgusted), but I'd like to offer a few suggestions on how to restore sanity to the process. 1. Make the presidency a six-year, one-term-only gig. That gives anyone elected to the job plenty of time to actually accomplish something, while also guaranteeing that the second half of his or her term won't be spent running for re-election. What a concept. 2. Start the campaign season after Labor Day. Most industrialized countries run political campaigns that are three months in length or less. Do they know something we don't? Or should I say, have you ever heard the term ""voter exhaustion?"" 3. Publicly finance the election. Citizens United, up there with Plessy v. Ferguson (separate but equal) as one of the worst decisions in Supreme Court history, only made a bad system even worse, allowing more millions to pour into an already corrupt process. So give each contender a fixed amount of money, and tell them they can spent it any way they want, but that's all they'll have -- no private, corporate or PAC contributions at all. Let 'em whine. Who cares? 4. Ban negative ads. Believe it or not, Mexico does this. They have an independent commission deciding when a political ad goes over the line into negativity and falsehood. If they can do it South of the Border, why can't we? 5. Limit polling. It seems there's a new poll every microsecond. What do they really tell us? That people's minds keep changing? Stop the presses on that one! Pass a law saying every news organization and polling organization can only do their thing, say, once a month. Eliminate the clutter. That'll do for a start. But I can hear some of you saying ""this is a free country, yadda yadda, people can spend their money any way they want, yaddayadda, there's such a thing as free speech in a democracy, yadda yadda yadda."" And besides, it's all settled law, you say; the court has ruled on Citizens United. Well, yes I know this. Things don't change overnight. But here's what else I know: Sometimes liberty becomes license. And that's what's happening in America today. Money has completely corrupted the system and helped create a situation where the U.S., the most powerful country on Earth, has one of the lowest voter turnouts (lower than any country in Western Europe or Latin America, lower than most countries in North America). You think disgust with the process has anything to do with this? Think about that the next time the Rich Folks For Super PACs super PAC puts another misleading, demeaning and infuriating political ad on the tube. How about you? What do you think we can do to improve the election process?

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Dr. Robert J. White performed his first neurosurgery at age 15 on a frog cadaver in high school biology class. Over the next 50 years, he operated on more than 10,000 brains, one of which accounted for the most ambitious neurological experiment in history: In the '70s, he successfully transplanted the head of one monkey to the body of another. For White's efforts, the monkey awoke from the anesthesia and tried to bite his finger off. During our interview at his local McDonald's from which he worked, White described his most daring research and experimental surgery, as well as the decades of clinical time he devoted to the treatment of brain and spinal cord injuries. He published more than 1,000 articles in medical journals and had audiences with four popes in his role as adviser to the papal authority on bioethics. Although less provocative than his work in the area of organ transplantation, his documentation of the effect of deep cooling on spinal injuries greatly reduced long-term damage of the spinal cord and paralysis. This pioneering work has been suggested by some in the neuroscience field as worthy of Nobel prize consideration. See the rest of ""Dr. White's full body transplant"" at VBS.tv . In his most controversial experiments -- more often that not involving the use of dogs and primates -- he successfully isolated the brain. As mentioned, he once transplanted the head of a monkey onto the body of another. In his estimation, this process, which he referred to as a ""whole body transplant,"" proved that the brain is truly the repository for human consciousness. Although the transplant remained viable for only two days before the animal died, future transplants extended the life span of the recipient. The issue of the paralysis that results from the severed spinal cord, however, was impossible to avoid and remains one of the largest areas of interest in modern medicine. As such, only people with pre-existing paralysis might benefit from this procedure. The animal rights movement has of course decried White's work, most of which was carried out decades ago when animal testing was not as controversial. The fact remains, though, that his career in neuroscience helped save countless human lives, even if he euthanized many dogs and monkeys along the way. Sadly, White died in September, but his work has left a lasting, wide-ranging influence on conventional medicine that will ultimately be the foundation for countless future scientists.","VBS sits down with noted neurosurgeon Dr. Robert J.

"(CNN) -- If one brings a gun to a fistfight, then the fight becomes a gunfight. Simple reasoning, of course, but it's also an unnecessary consequence of combining legislation that makes guns readily available with ""stand your ground"" laws. I can already hear the clicking of keyboards from my desk, as the drinkers of NRA-flavored Kool-Aid feverishly type their outrage and disgust with any suggestion that gun laws need to be reviewed. I own guns. They are kept in my home. I strongly believe in the ""castle doctrine,"" which essentially means that homeowners have no duty or requirement to retreat in their home if they are attacked within it. If someone breaks into a stranger's home, the homeowner doesn't know whether the intruder is there to rob, rape, terrorize or have milk and cookies with them. Regardless, it's reasonable that a robber should have an expectation of death if he or she breaks into someone's home. Unstable ground: The fine line between self-defense and murder . Florida's stand your ground law was passed in 2005, under Gov. Jeb Bush's administration. This is the law that has garnered so much national attention since the Trayvon Martin shooting and George Zimmerman's arrest. Stand your ground legislation basically extends the castle doctrine to all places beyond the home. Retreat in order to avoid a confrontation becomes unnecessary even in a public place. Florida Statute 776.013 (3) states: . ""A person who is not engaged in unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony."" This law applies a confusing blend of subjective and objective standards. Stand your ground is appropriate in many circumstances, but the lack of clarity in the statute needs to be addressed and re-evaluated, particularly when firearms are so readily accessible in public places. The way the statute is written, an individual who observes a fistfight could conceivably shoot and kill the dominator in the fight if they reasonably believed that person was going to cause ""great bodily harm"" to the other. Even if the two combatants knew that the fight was nothing more than a ""good ol' boy"" disagreement, the way the statute is written could allow a gun to be used if the observer reasonably and actually believed that great bodily harm could occur. Moreover, merging the statute with overly relaxed gun laws could open the door for the guilty to walk away without consequence. Consider another gun-toting observer of the hypothetical fist fight, who is an enemy of one of the combatants. He could easily hide behind the claim that he reasonably believed that the other combatant was going to cause great bodily harm if the fight continued. The shooter could have every evil motive in the world, but so long as he stood behind the story that he reasonably believed the other person could suffer great bodily harm or death, then he could conceivably  walk. When guns are permitted in every public place and are mixed with such an obtusely written statute, a puzzling and perplexing standard of behavior regarding the use of guns occurs. This becomes a recipe for disaster and death. Gun laws and the stand your ground law need to be re-evaluated and addressed responsibly very soon.  If we don't learn lessons from the Trayvon Martin tragedy, then we are doomed to see similar events happen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark NeJame.","Mark NeJame: Combination of guns and ""stand your ground"" laws are dangerous .

"(CNN) -- For Andy Copeland, the ""Aimee Day"" event he'd been waiting for happened when he was in church. Copeland was in the pews at a Baptist church in Augusta, Georgia, on Sunday morning when a text message notified him his 24-year-old daughter could not only breathe on her own, but also talk for the first time in weeks. It was a major milestone for Aimee, who is battling a flesh-eating bacteria that has already led surgeons to amputate her hands, part of her abdomen, one of her legs and her remaining foot in an effort to stay ahead of the disease. Family counters flesh-eating bacteria with faith . ""I was so excited I wanted to spring up out of the pew and into the aisle and do a dance,"" Andy Copeland posted on the family's website Monday. ""My fellow Baptists probably would not have appreciated that, so I resisted the urge. Instead, my fingers danced across my phone."" Two weeks ago, in a post on his Facebook page, Copeland wrote that the family would mark that milestone ""forever for the rest of your life."" It would be several hours before he was able to see his daughter -- she had put off her family for much of the day after being given a drug that caused nausea and intestinal cramps, and Copeland said he was doing ""emotional backflips"" the entire time. But when he did see her Sunday evening, ""Aimee was expressive and she clearly elucidated her thoughts,"" he wrote. ""Her long-term memory was intact. We listened to the iPod Shuffle that Eddie Mattock of Pittsburgh had sent her, and she told me the story of Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter,"" Copeland wrote. ""We discussed ideas of how to utilize wilderness therapy/eco-psychology for amputees. We talked about her current physical condition. We smiled and at times we said nothing. Just being there and seeing her happiness put a certain peace in my heart."" And on Monday, ""Aimee continues to talk and joke,"" he added. ""Her nurse bumped her head and Aimee said, 'Now my nurse needs a nurse!' Then she winked at us and said, 'I'll take care of her.' She then waved her arm in the air and said, 'these fingers can work magic.' She grinned at us. She knew she didn't have any fingers, but she's not worried about it either. She knows everything is going to be fine. We know everything is going to be fine. We all know it is going to be a long and challenging road, but we will handle it together."" Father: 'I have never seen such a strong display of courage' AImee Copeland was taken off a ventilator May 20 and had been mouthing words without sound for several days before her voice was heard, her family said. Her ordeal began May 1, when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta. The line snapped, and she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room. Doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Her father has written regularly since about her situation, with over 72,500 ""likes"" on his Facebook blog devoted to Aimee's fight. And the psychology department at the University of West Georgia -- where Aimee has been pursuing her master's degree in psychology -- also posted regular updates online. A number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to the disease. When it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Since Copeland's struggle came to light, there have been reports of others fighting the same disease. They include Lana Kuykendall, a South Carolina woman also diagnosed earlier this month, a few days after giving birth to twins. She has had at least 11 ""debridement surgeries"" but thus far no amputations, with her brother Brian Swaffer noting late last week that the condition is confined to his sister's legs and she, too, is breathing on her own.","Aimee Copeland began speaking Sunday, her father says .

"(CNN) -- Watch out Howard Stern, it looks like Steve Harvey is angling for the title of ""King of All Media."" Both outspoken men have much in common, including being unabashed divorcees, best-selling authors whose books were turned into hit movies (""Private Parts"" and ""Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Man,"" respectively) and hosts of no-holds-barred radio shows heard throughout the nation. But when it comes to TV, Harvey just may have the leg up. Stern made his prime time debut this year as a judge on ""America's Got Talent;"" Harvey hosts ""Family Feud"" and his daytime talk show, ""The Steve Harvey Show,"" is set to premiere on September 4. ""I think it's going to be great,"" Harvey said about the show, which is currently in production at NBC's Chicago studios. ""It's going to be a daytime show with a wonderful comedic spin where people get to laugh out loud during the daytime. At the same time, we're going to have great take-aways about medical and weight, dieting, parenting, relationships. I got a lot to draw on."" Harvey, 55, joins a growing list of daytime TV hosts looking to fill the void left by Oprah Winfrey. Katie Couric and Ricki Lake will debut new shows this fall, and mainstays Ellen DeGeneres and Wendy Williams have been renewed through 2014. Harvey is confident he can stand out from the crowd. ""I think the uniqueness of (my show) is the male perspective, which is missing from daytime television,"" he said. ""Steve is like that wise but funny uncle we all have,"" Dawn Davis, Harvey's publisher at Harper Collins said. ""The one with sage advice at graduation, and a healthy but gentle dose of truth-talking at Thanksgiving."" That personality goes a long way, said Premiere Networks President Julie Talbott whose company syndicates ""The Steve Harvey Show"" on radio across the country to 7 million listeners. ""Steve Harvey's audience growth and ratings have been consistently impressive,"" Talbott said. ""His passion for entertaining has allowed him to connect with people across multiple platforms. He's truly a renaissance man."" As one of ""The Original Kings of Comedy,"" he is used to trying to connect with audiences, but he recently retired from stand-up, claiming, ""Comedy isn't what it used to be. There are not the venues available for these young acts to hone their skills and talents, which is really a shame. It's like musicians have become a dying breed; comedians have, too."" In August 2012, 15,000 fans attended his final stand-up show at the MGM Grand Arena in Las Vegas. The concert, which was also streamed live Pay Per View, was the perfect send-off for Harvey, who cried tears of gratitude and joy at the end of the show. ""I think it's a great time to get out,"" he told CNN, backstage at the Arena. ""I don't want to be 60 hoping y'all come see me. I don't want to be one of the ones where people say 'Man, whatever happened to so and so?' What people do is stay too long and then just all of a sudden, you ain't funny no more and people stop coming to see you. Instead of selling out theaters, you're back in comedy clubs and your light diminishes. I never wanted that; I wanted to go out on top."" Harvey knows success is never guaranteed, but he remains faithfully optimistic. ""I've never done a talk show. I don't know how it's going to go, but I also know that God didn't bring me this far to leave me, so He causes things to happen.""","Steve Harvey has a daytime talk show debuting .

"(CNN) -- A California company and its president pleaded guilty Monday to federal charges related to the distribution of human growth hormone, the Justice Department said. DNP International Company, Inc., of Santa Fe Springs pleaded guilty to three counts, including a felony charge for the wholesale distribution of a prescription drug and two misdemeanor charges, the department said in a news release. Owner David Ji, 50, of Irvine, pleaded guilty to a felony count of distributing prescription drugs in interstate commerce without a license, it said. ""When he pleaded guilty (Monday), Ji admitted that his company had distributed an unapproved drug containing somatropin -- a human growth hormone product -- which had not been approved for distribution in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration because the version of the drug being distributed by DNP was manufactured in China,"" the release said. The company and Ji entered their pleas before U.S. District Judge George H. King, who set sentencing for December 10. Ji faced up to 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine. DNP faces a $900,000 fine. But his lawyer, Marc Harris, said prosecutors have agreed to recommend probation for five years, a $103,000 fine and a $147,000 forfeiture in exchange for Ji's plea. Human growth hormone is produced in the brain by the pituitary gland. In the United States, it is approved for the treatment of short stature due to growth hormone deficiency and a number of other indications. Injection of its recombinant form has been touted by some advocates as a way to improve performance in sports. Ji sold 24 grams to a pharmacy in Brooklyn, New York, Harris said, adding that Ji's company continues to thrive by selling legitimate products.","DNP International and its president plead guilty .

"(CNN) -- Advancements in Iranian missile capabilities are driving Gulf Arab countries to cooperate on a theater-wide missile defense system. The fear is that Iran could launch missiles at refineries, population centers, oil tankers and naval forces if conflict erupted. To deter and, if necessary, destroy Iranian missiles, the United States is championing a defense shield across the Arabian Peninsula, covering Kuwait to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. But pronouncements are easier to make than to realize in practice. Can these Gulf nations overcome their differences for their mutual protection? Is U.S. diplomacy sufficient to forge such collaboration? The proposal occurs amid escalating tensions with Iran. Last year the International Atomic Energy Agency raised new concerns about Iran's secretive nuclear programs. Diplomacy failed to address these issues, prompting the United States and Europe to tighten sanctions against Iran's oil economy. While the Tehran regime ratchets up its rhetoric, senior U.S. officials are trying to forestall an Israeli pre-emptive attack on Iran's nuclear sites and to reassure Gulf leaders that a U.S.-led defensive umbrella would mitigate the effects of any conflict. The United States has potent, seaborne Aegis anti-missile defenses to offer, and Israel and Saudi Arabia have previously invested in missile defense systems. Indeed, Saudi Arabia recently announced a major modernization of its Patriot Advanced Capability, or PAC-3, missile systems. But the latest scheme is a plan to build a regional network linking Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates into a wider intelligence and early-warning network, offering them defensive systems that can operate with U.S. Armed Forces. Opinion: Romney on Iran is just like Obama . Recent multibillion-dollar deals include Kuwait's purchase of 60 new PAC-3 missiles and a variety of radars, control stations and launching stations; and the United Arab Emirates' deployment of both PAC-3 short-range interceptors and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, medium-range interceptors. Meanwhile, the United States has been beefing up defenses at its bases in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain (headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet) as well as erecting an early-warning radar system in Qatar. The chaos in Syria adds urgency to these efforts. President Bashar al-Assad has threatened to fire missiles and chemical weapons against states that intervene in Syria's civil war, presumably including countries supporting future U.S. military activities. But while Syria may pose a threat to some in the region, theater missile defenses are primarily aimed at Iran's mounting military arsenal. Those growing capabilities include short-range missiles designed to hit sea-based targets as well as medium-range Shahab and Ghadr missiles. Iran's missiles are mostly mobile and thus difficult to strike pre-emptively. The Pentagon estimates that Iran could test-flight an intercontinental missile, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, as early as 2015. In the midst of these tensions, few would be shocked by a war with Iran. Indeed, many already see a low-level ""shadow war"" under way, with assassinations, terrorism, offensive cyberwarfare (including the use of the Stuxnet computer worm that infected Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities at Natanz), unmanned aerial vehicles and the use of special operations forces widely reported. The Iranians have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz oil route, a move that could be accomplished by laying mines and targeting the narrow shipping chokepoint, or using swarm boat tactics to attack combat ships and tankers, or blowing up critical energy infrastructure that would be costly and difficult to replace. In other words, any missile defenses would be part of a larger war, making it difficult to predict the various scenarios that might unfold in a prolonged, wider war with Iran. Opinion: A lull in the drift toward war with Iran? All these military measures would have to be tied to political goals. Yet an escalating conflict could easily lead to shifting war aims and mission creep. For example, the United States and its allies might seek regime change rather than just the eradication of Iran's nuclear program. Likewise, for the Iranian regime, objectives could encompass not just survival and sanction-busting but also a desire to inflict economic harm on the United States and threaten the viability of Israel. Israel, with its Iron Dome and Arrow anti-ballistic missile defense systems, has the world's most robust national missile defenses in the world. Yet if Tehran acquires nuclear weapons, many Israelis believe the Iranians would use them as an offensive weapon and not just to achieve deterrence. Israel's Iron Dome can protect against short-range missiles, and recently upgraded Arrow systems are designed to thwart advanced medium-range missiles. But reports are rampant that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might pre-emptively strike Iran's nuclear facilities before the U.S. November elections. No doubt such reports are only further encouraging the Obama administration's intensive efforts to strengthen deterrence and reassure regional partners. Opinion: What if Israel bombs Iran? But it is unlikely that Israel and the Gulf Arab states can forge a seamless missile shield across a vast region. Indeed, there are serious questions about how well Gulf states can share information and act in concert. What's new this past year is that five of the six-member states that make up the Gulf Cooperation Council (Oman being the outlier) are attempting NATO-like security cooperation despite their different agendas and historical antipathies. Longstanding differences are unlikely to be bridged in a matter of months -- unless something forces them together. No country is eager to blunder into war with Iran. At the same time, should conflict escalate, Iran's actions may drive disparate actors, even Gulf Arab states and Israel, to unprecedented collaboration for their mutual defense. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Patrick M. Cronin.","Patrick M. Cronin: Gulf Arab countries are cooperating on a missile shield against Iran .

"(CNN) -- Cases of West Nile virus are up 25% over the past week and are expected to rise further over the next several weeks, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. As of Tuesday, 1,993 reported cases of West Nile virus have been reported in humans, including 87 deaths. Last week, the CDC said there were 1,590 cases with 66 deaths. ""As we expected, the number of humans with West Nile virus disease continues to rise in the United States,"" said Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. ""We expect this increase to continue for the next several weeks, probably until October."" The number of West Nile cases is the highest reported to the CDC through the first week in September since 1999, when the mosquito-borne virus was first detected in the United States. Fast facts on West Nile virus . More than 70% of cases are in six states: Texas, South Dakota, Mississippi, Michigan, Oklahoma and Louisiana, officials said. Texas bears the brunt of the outbreak, with nearly 45% of cases. Wednesday's briefing focused on how Hurricane Isaac may have affected the outbreak and how Texas is managing its high number of cases. ""As of now, 2012 is the worst year in the state of Texas for West Nile disease,"" said Dr. David L. Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services. He says that before this, 2003 was the worst year for the virus. Although Petersen did not give any specific numbers associated with states affected by Hurricane Isaac, he stressed that the CDC is working with state and local officials in those areas to offer assistance on managing infestations. Experience with natural disasters such as hurricanes has shown that West Nile virus cases do not tend to increase in their wake, he said. However, people who spent more time outdoors because they were displaced from their homes or during recovery efforts may be more likely to contract the virus. Who's at risk for West Nile virus? Aerial spraying has sometimes been used to control mosquitoes after hurricanes, Petersen said. In Texas, spraying has been effective in areas that utilized it, Lakey said. A 93% reduction was seen in the density of mosquitoes in areas that received two consecutive sprays, he said. Unsprayed areas showed increases in virus-carrying mosquitoes, and places that were not sprayed consecutively showed smaller reductions in mosquitoes. Protection against mosquito bites is the best defense against West Nile virus, Petersen said. He recommended wearing long pants and sleeves during dusk and dawn -- prime mosquito times -- to prevent bites. In addition, he said, wear insect repellent when you go outdoors; install or repair screens on doors and windows; use air conditioning if possible; empty standing water from outdoor containers and objects that collect water; and support local mosquito control programs.","Cases of West Nile virus are up 25% in the past week .

"(CNN) -- Asia's economic growth will tumble to the slowest pace since the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a report released Tuesday. Customers buy vegetables at a market in Quezon City in suburban Manila, Philippines, on September 16. ""The short term outlook for the region is bleak as the full impact of the severe recession in industrialized economies is transmitted to emerging markets,"" said Jong-Wha Lee, acting chief economist for the ADB. The Asian Development Outlook 2009 forecasts that economic growth in developing Asia will slip to 3.4 percent in 2009, down from 6.3 percent last year and 9.5 percent in 2007. Growth could improve to 6 percent in 2010, if the global economy experiences a mild recovery next year, the report says. ""The concern for the region, and especially for the region's poor, is that it is not yet clear that the [United States], European Union and Japan will recover as soon as next year,"" Lee said. The slowdown should prompt Asian countries to expand their economic base and not be as dependent on exports, according to the report. Despite the downturn, the report says Asia is in a much better position to cope with the current crisis than it was in the late 1990s. ""Large foreign currency reserves and steadily declining inflation rates will provide policymakers with the necessary tools to nurse their economies through the hard times ahead,"" the report said. A number of Asian governments, including China, Japan and South Korea, have already responded quickly to the global financial crisis with stimulus packages and changes in monetary policy, helping to stem some of the downturn. In November, China announced plans to inject $586 billion (4 trillion yuan) into its economy to offset declines in industrial and export growth. That economic stimulus plan included the loosening of credit restrictions, tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending.","Economic growth in developing Asia forecast to slip to 3.4 percent in 2009 .

"Editor's note: James L. Walker, Jr., author of the book, ""This Business of Urban Music,"" is a sports and entertainment lawyer whose firm, Walker & Associates, is based in Stamford, Connecticut. James L. Walker Jr. says the evidence shows Michael Jackson was addicted to drugs. (CNN) -- Michael Jackson died of an overdose, according to the preliminary finding of the Los Angeles coroner described in court documents. The King of Pop apparently was given a variety of drugs that included the powerful sedative propofol, according to authorities. The news came as a shock to some. But the reality it pointed to was this: Michael Jackson was an addict. A drug addict is a person who has become physiologically or psychologically dependent on a habit-forming substance or drug. I operate a halfway house and we deal with this struggle regularly with our men, who have become addicts, and they continually tell me how hard it is to overcome. They also tell me that people are vulnerable to addiction whether white or black, rich or poor: Drugs don't discriminate. I am also an entertainment lawyer who understands the pressures of working in the music industry and the experience of insomnia that Jackson apparently complained about over the years. And, of course, like millions of others, I am a huge Jackson fan and I own all the records and CDs and had THE jacket (from the ""Beat It"" video). And, I can sympathize with his sad life, legal problems, personal struggles, family issues and financial meltdown. But, while I sing his songs regularly and imitate his dance moves, when the laughter and joy stops, it hurts me to admit the reality: Michael Jackson was a drug addict who didn't need to be the center of another musical tour, but needed to be the star patient at a treatment center. For years, we have heard reports of Michael Jackson being addicted to painkillers and other things. However, in our society, we tend to overlook that when it's a big name celebrity or someone we love in our circle of family and friends. Celebrities drop in and out of rehabilitation centers and drug abuse facilities nationwide. And, their lives go on and it's merely a passing footnote on the TV ticker running across the bottom of the screen. With Jackson's tragic death at the young age of 50, hopefully some folks will wake up. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that in the year prior to being surveyed in 2006, 560,000 Americans age 12 and older abused heroin at least once; more than 16 million Americans took prescription pain reliever, tranquilizer, stimulant, or sedative for nonmedical purposes; 6 million abused cocaine in any form; and 1.5 million abused crack. In the case of Jackson, there is a lot of finger pointing at Dr. Conrad Murray and several other doctors, who may or may not be charged. But, while we mourn the Motown legend and the tragedy of his life and death, it is important to note that this sad story sheds light on a much bigger problem in America: drug abuse. Author Deepak Chopra, a friend of Jackson, has been telling us for weeks now on national TV outlets that Jackson had a drug problem. ""Dr. Murray is the one who is going to be blamed because he injected the drug, but from what I've learned he did not prescribe the drug,"" Chopra told CNN in reminding investigators to look deeper and further than Dr. Murray. Like Chopra, I hope investigators will go deeper, but I hope we will go deeper as a society. Jackson sold hundreds of millions of records, including the top selling album of all time, ""Thriller."" With his death, we can reach and teach billions of the dangers of drug use. Unfortunately, he joins a long list of major artists who have seen superstar careers end by the mortal reality that drug addiction can kill you. It hurts us to talk about Jackson's drug addiction or drug problems, as it hurts us to look at a near-century of great artists struggling with drug issues and in some cases dying at the hands of drugs -- from jazz legend Billie Holiday's drug problem to Marilyn Monroe's overdose to singer Dorothy Dandridge's death from anti-depressants. Elvis Presley's death brought to public light his prescription drug addiction. And, we saw in recent years Kurt Cobain's heroin-induced suicide death, and the 2004 death of Rick James, who wrote ""Superfreak,"" from a drug-related heart attack. Too often these stories don't prompt substantial national outrage and we fail to break the stereotypical picture of what we think of when we hear the words ""drug addict."" Police and prosecutors are still mum on whether Jackson's death will result in criminal charges. It is not clear who is at fault. But no one is disputing that Jackson asked for these drugs repeatedly over the years, like most drug addicts, and had a sickness that afflicts millions of other Americans. So, let the legal system play out, but let's stop avoiding what hurts the most, so we can save millions of other drug addicts from this horrible nightmare and other families from the pain the Jackson family will now live with forever. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James L. Walker, Jr.","James Walker: Coroner's preliminary finding shows Jackson died of an overdose .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A car bomb exploded outside a Baghdad coffee shop Saturday, killing two people and wounding 11 others, police in the Iraqi capital said. The blast happened around 9 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) in the al-Shurta al-Rabaa neighborhood, a predominantly Shiite section of southwestern Baghdad. With those deaths, the Iraqi Interior Ministry announced Sunday that 164 people had been killed throughout the country in August. This figure incorporates information from Iraq's interior, defense and health ministries. A CNN tally indicates that more than 270 people died last month in violence throughout Iraq, however. Iraq announces 21 people executed in one day . Official government death tolls have historically been lower than unofficial figures and daily tallies from media and other organizations. Saturday's bombing caps a particularly turbulent few months in the Middle Eastern nation. Violence had generally dropped in Iraq in recent years compared with the middle of the past decade, when Sunni-Shiite conflict raged during the height of the Iraq war. However, it hit a nearly two-year peak in July with 325 deaths reported, the Interior Ministry has said. That was the deadliest single month since August 2010, when the toll was 426, the ministry said. U.S. troops completed their withdrawal from Iraq in December. The most recent violence includes a wave of shootings and bombings August 16 that killed more than 80 people and wounded more than 270 across the country. Insurgents carried out attacks in Baghdad and Kirkuk, Salaheddin, Anbar, Wasit and Diyala provinces, according to police and Interior Ministry officials. The violence came in the final days of the holy month of Ramadan, when Iraqis traditionally fill shops and markets to prepare for the Eid feast.

"(CNN) -- World Bank President Robert Zoellick has warned that the eurozone crisis could have a dire effect on emerging markets if it continues in 2012. Speaking to CNN's John Defterios at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zoellick discussed the World Bank's assessment that the coming year could be as bad for emerging markets as 2008 if the eurozone crisis worsened. ""If there's a more serious breakdown in the eurozone... then developing countries have to be prepared,"" he said. ""They have to pre-fund some of their own bonds, they have to look at the trade side, they have to look at the banking side."" He said that while developing countries had provided about two-thirds of growth globally over the past five years, ""we're all in this boat together and so if Europe really stumbles and fails it's going to hurt everybody."" The World Bank is trying to shield emerging markets by making $27 billion available over next two years, specifically in central and eastern Europe. While each emerging market would weather the crisis differently, he said, ""the closer you are to Europe, the more you're going to be at risk."" He said the issues underlying Europe's crisis were yet be resolved. ""Europe has sort of stumbled up to each crisis, put together a package, managed to get through the crisis, and it's bought time but it hasn't fundamentally addressed the problem."" Solving the crisis now required ""paying attention to the politics of reform, not just the economics of the balance sheet. My belief is Germany and others need to hold out some carrots if these countries sustain the political support,"" he said. ""It's really now in my view a question of Italy and Spain.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- More than 30 people were killed Monday in southeastern Kenya in the latest outbreak of tribal violence. A mob of more than 300 people descended on the village of Kilelengwani in the remote Tana Delta on Monday, many of them armed with spears and machetes, the Kenya Red Cross said. Thirty-three men, women and children were killed, including seven police officers who had been deployed to the area as a buffer between warring tribes. The massacre comes just days after nearly a dozen people were killed in the same region in what appears to be continued tit-for-tat violence that erupted last month. The violence is blamed on the Pokomo and Orma tribes prevalent in the region. The Pokomo are largely settled farmers, and the Orma are traditionally pastoralists, tending cattle and goat herds. There has been long-running tension between the two groups over grazing rights and water sources, but it boiled over last month when the Pokomo attacked an Orma village after an apparent land dispute. More than 50 people were killed in that attack, mostly women and children. The revenge attacks are the worst violence in Kenya since more than a thousand people were killed and hundreds of thousands were left homeless after a disputed election in late 2007. Kenya's security forces have been heavily criticized for being unable to quell the escalating violence along the Tana River. Samuel Kilele, the police commissioner of the coast, said hundreds of police were in the area, but rugged terrain and poor infrastructure made it hard to get there. He said four local administrators were being fired for their lack of a response. But in a move indicating the seriousness of the situation, he said the Kenyan military could be brought in to bring security to the region. ""If the situation proves more volatile, then the deployment of the army will be inevitable,"" Kilele said.","More than 300 people, many with spears and machetes, struck Tana River village .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Operators of a South African gold mine negotiated with about 15,000 striking workers Monday after they walked off the job the night before, a company official said. ""At this stage, the reason for the strike remains unclear, but we hope to gain clarity as soon as possible,"" said a statement from Peter Turner, a Gold Field executive vice president. ""The situation in the mine has been calm and peaceful since the start of the strike, and we appeal to all stakeholders to continue to act with restraint and to engage in good faith. ""It is important that we restore normality in a peaceful manner and as soon as possible,"" he said. Management called the strike at the KDC Gold Mine on the West Rand ""Unlawful and unprotected."" The striking miners could not immediately be reached for comment. The KDC workers join about 28,000 other miners who are already on strike at the Lonmin PLC platinum mine in Marikana, about two hours northwest of Johannesburg. August 16 clashes at the Lonmin mine left 34 people dead and 78 wounded, sparking national outrage. Management at Lonmin set a Monday deadline for strikers to return to work, but workers did not appear to heed the call, as several thousand were marching outside the facility. The violence in August erupted after negotiations between striking workers and Lonmin broke down and police decided to fence in the machete-armed miners with barbed wire, police said. Thousands of mineworkers had been striking for days for higher wages. Lonmin has so far missed out on around $75 million in lost production, and the workers haven't been paid for a month. The company said last week that a ""peace accord"" had been signed, but key unions had not agreed to the deal. Late last month, a regional prosecutor charged 270 of the platinum miners with the murder of their colleagues, who are believed to have been shot by police. However, a national prosecutor has said that authorities would dismiss the provisional charges and release the miners, pending further investigation. South Africa drops murder charges against miners . Last week, 47 of the miners appeared in court and were ordered released. Lawyers for the miners had called the decision to charge them with murder ""bizarre in the extreme."" The country's justice minister called the charges shocking and confusing.

The violence occurred after former employees staged a protest outside the mine's gates, Johannesburg police Capt. Pinky Tsinyane said. The protesters had been fired for participating in an earlier illegal strike, the company said.

"(CNN) -- While we learned that rising stars in the Democratic Party come in younger (Sandra Fluke) and older (Elizabeth Warren) versions, it was a party elder and established superstar (President Bill Clinton) who stole the show on Day Two of the Democratic convention. Wednesday's session began amid controversy over language in the party's platform that saw a tumultuous voice vote. And another one. And another one. It's not the image Democrats wanted to project after a successful opening night. And while Clinton's speech was 15 minutes longer than his famously panned 1988 convention address, this one kept the audience in the packed Time Warner Cable Arena on its feet. Here are five things we learned from Wednesday night: . 1. Clinton delivers . Forty eight minutes, more or less. That's how long Clinton's speech lasted on Wednesday night, but no one in Charlotte gave a rip. Why? The Full Clinton showed up Wednesday with a combative, charming and substantive piece of oratory that many in the political class immediately billed as one of the best speeches he has ever delivered. Clinton's remarks at the DNC . And crucially, President Barack Obama -- who has struggled to explain his policy accomplishments to the public -- got a tremendous boost from the best communicator in American politics. Republicans were stunned after the speech. ""Tonight, when everybody leaves, lock the door,"" GOP strategist Alex Castellanos said on CNN immediately after the speech ended. ""You don't have to come back tomorrow. This convention is done. This will be the moment that probably re-elected Barack Obama. Bill Clinton saved the Democratic Party once. It was going too far left. He came in and took it to the center. He did it again tonight."" Mike Murphy, another leading Republican operative, tweeted his praise. ""Highly effective Clinton speech. Aimed right at voters Obama needs,"" Murphy wrote. And then: ""A master's class in using (select) factoids and policy ideas to 'explain' and score big politically. Mitt's speech should have done this."" Forget that Clinton strayed from his prepared remarks repeatedly and was not even halfway through his speech when the clock struck 11 p.m. on the East Coast -- the Big Dog delivered. Now it's Obama's turn. 2. Clinton answers the burning question . Republicans criticized Democrats this week for largely avoiding a firm answer on the question of whether Americans are better off than they were four years ago. It was a question that first gained traction last week during Mitt Romney's acceptance speech, when he said, ""You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him."" Clinton says Obama offers a better path forward for America . And the issue further snowballed when Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland answered ""no"" to the query during a Sunday interview -- a reply quickly seized upon by Republicans. While speakers at the DNC Tuesday and Wednesday mostly stayed away from the topic, Clinton answered it head-on in his speech, delivering perhaps his biggest moment of the night. ""He inherited a deeply damaged economy. He put a floor under the crash. He began the long, hard road to recovery and laid the foundation for a modern, more well-balanced economy,"" he said. He continued: ""Now are we where we want to be today? No. Is the president satisfied? Of course not. But are we better off than when we were when he took office? Listen to me,"" he said, as the crowd roared. He then painted a picture of economic conditions at the time Obama took office in January 2009, saying 750,000 jobs were disappearing per month and adding the economy was ""in free fall."" ""Are we doing better than today? The answer -- yes,"" he said forcefully. He used the ""better off"" theme several more times through the night. Inside the DNC: Sights and sounds from convention-goers . Clinton rallied the crowd, urging them of the importance of re-electing Obama to finish what he described as a tough ride from the start. ""No president -- not me, not any of my predecessors -- no one could have fully repaired all the damage he found in just four years,"" he said. 3. Foreign policy and faith still matter . What goes around, comes around. One week after criticizing the platform that Republicans approved at their convention last week, Democrats got a taste of their own medicine on Day Two of their convention. While Tuesday's session was considered a strong opener, there was a growing controversy over the omission in the current platform of a line from the 2008 platform that recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Republicans and Mitt Romney presidential campaign officials quickly pounced. Fast forward a day: The Wednesday session started with some dissension when delegates approved a change in the party platform to reinstate the 2008 line. Another change restored the word ""God"" to the platform after the 2012 version omitted it, though it included language on faith as part of American society. The language referring to God-given rights was the same as in the 2008 platform. Just in: Democrats update platform with Jerusalem, God reference . But it took three voice votes to pass the changes, with supporters and opponents loudly expressing their sentiments. When Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, chairman of the convention, said that the motion passed with a two-thirds majority, some delegates made it clear they weren't happy. Obama himself intervened regarding the Jerusalem language, a senior Democratic source told CNN. And Democrats say that illustrates that the president showed leadership. But the damage was done. Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul was quick to put out a statement saying ""Mitt Romney has consistently stated his belief that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel."" Analysts said it was a terrible start to the second day. ""After a roaring first night that we all proclaimed was successful, they started out Wednesday night with a stumble,"" said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, who has advised Democratic and Republican presidents. Van Jones, a CNN contributor and former Obama administration special adviser, called it a ""big blunder."" ""I think it was handled badly from beginning to end, and now I think we're going to pay a price for it,"" he said. CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said the conversation should have never come up. ""The Democrats last week decided to make a very big deal of the Republican platform. When you do that, it is Politics 101, you better scrub yours, because you know this is coming,"" he said. ""This is Keystone Cops."" 4. We, not me . The theme of convention week is ""Americans Coming Together"" -- and for the second night in a row, Democrats hammered the premise home with a clarion call for collectivism instead of individualism. This isn't a big shocker. Those two worldviews are at the heart of the ideological schism between the Democrats and Republicans. But in speech after speech about the slowly recovering economy, Democrats aggressively pushed a common message: We're all in this together. Five lines that killed on Day Two . ""Democrats believe in reigniting the American dream by removing barriers to success and building ladders of opportunity for all, so everyone can succeed,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced. ""The American dream belongs to all of us,"" said California Attorney General Kamala Harris. Then there was the hook of Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's speech about how he started a successful chain of Denver brewpubs from next to nothing. ""It was 'we,' not 'me,' "" Hickenlooper said over and over again. The contrast at work here? Republicans look out for themselves, while Democrats look out for each other. It takes a village and all that. If you didn't have that message drilled into your brain at the end of the night, you probably missed that middle school English class lesson about ""context clues."" Or you were watching the Cowboys-Giants game? 5. Paul Ryan a bigger thorn in Romney's side than Bain? Mitt Romney faced a tsunami of attacks this summer over his business background and former private equity firm, Bain Capital. A pro-Obama super PAC particularly hammered Romney, spending $20 million on commercials in crucial swing states painting Romney as a greedy corporate raider. And while speakers addressed Bain during prime time, Democrats seemed to be more fired up about another target Wednesday night: his running mate. Fact or fiction? Paul Ryan's RNC speech . Speech after speech dealt several zings at Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan, a proposal widely backed by the GOP and one that favors tax cuts coupled with large entitlement cuts. Sister Simone Campbell especially hammered home the point. The nun has led other nuns on a nine-state bus tour this summer, campaigning against Ryan's plan as a measure that stands in the way of the church's moral teachings. ""Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are correct when they say that each individual should be responsible. But their budget goes astray in not acknowledging that we are responsible not only for ourselves and our immediate families,"" she said. ""Rather, our faith strongly affirms that we are all responsible for one another."" Her comments were carried further by U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who serves on the same House Budget Committee chaired by Ryan. Van Hollen, who's been tapped to play the role of Ryan in debate prep for Vice President Joe Biden, said Romney and Ryan's ""obsession with tax breaks for the wealthy is part of a rigid ideology."" ""But this theory crashed in the real world. We all lived through the recession when jobs went down and the deficit went up,"" he said. ""So when they say they'll turn around the economy, beware. They mean a U-turn back to this failed theory that lifted the yachts while other boats ran aground."" Wednesday night's program certainly highlighted Romney's time at Bain, especially when three laid-off workers took the stage to blast the GOP nominee as a heartless businessman motivated only by profit. But a stronger theme threaded throughout the night could be found in Ryan's sweeping budget proposals and Democrats' fervent opposition to it. Political observers say Romney's pick in Ryan was risky, given the congressman's highly polarizing policy proposals. Watching the convention this week, it seems those attacks fuel plenty of fire against Romney, one that may not die down anytime soon.

"(CNN) -- Joey Barton, one of the most controversial footballers in the English Premier League, has been hit with a 12-match ban by the Football Association (FA). The Queens Park Rangers midfielder, who has 1.5 million followers on micro-blogging site Twitter, was found guilty of two charges of violent conduct during a tumultuous clash with Manchester City earlier this month. Barton was sent off for elbowing Argentina striker Carlos Tevez, then kicked Tevez's compatriot Sergio Aguero before appearing to aim a headbutt at City captain Vincent Kompany. The 29-year-old attended an FA hearing at Wembley on Wednesday where he was given a Â£75,000 ($117,000) fine in addition to his lengthy ban. Manchester City win Premier League as Barton sees red . In a statement on their official website the FA confirmed Barton would receive an initial four match ban for his dismissal and eight more games for his two further offenses. The FA said: ""There are rules of conduct that should be adhered to, and such behavior tarnishes the image of football in this country, particularly as this match was the pinnacle of the domestic season and watched by millions around the globe."" Barton's regular rants on Twitter, interspersed with quotes from philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and lyrics from songs of The Smiths, have gained him a huge following. He often tweets about visits to art galleries and his take on modern culture, and he's also been interviewed on UK political shows such as Newsnight. Barton's indiscretions at Manchester City are the latest in a long line of misdemeanors in what has been a checkered career to date. He was sentenced to six months in prison while a Newcastle United player for an assault in Liverpool city center and later transfer listed by the club after criticizing the hierarchy on Twitter. Prior to that, at Manchester City, he was fined for stubbing a cigar out in the eye of a youth team player and in a separate incident, was sent home from a tour of Thailand after an altercation with a 15-year-old Everton fan. After his red card at City he took to Twitter to try and explain his actions, stating: ""The head was never gone at any stage, once I'd been sent off, one of our players suggested I should try to take 1 of theirs with me."" His 12-match ban puts his future at QPR in doubt, the team having retained their Premier League status on the final day of the season despite his red card. A Rangers spokesman said: ""QPR will be making no comment in regard to the Joey Barton case. An internal investigation will begin in due course.""","QPR midfielder Joey Barton is banned for 12 matches by English Football Association .

"(CNN) -- Shanshan Feng wants to emulate the superstar status enjoyed by fellow Chinese sports star Li Na after becoming the country's first winner of a major golf tournament. Feng carded a five-under-par 67 to seal a two-shot triumph at the LPGA Championship in New York on Sunday, which also made her the first woman from mainland China to win on the U.S. women's circuit. Her previous best performance in 16 other major championships was a tie for 22nd at the Kraft Nabisco in April. Tennis star Li saw her profile increase dramatically after clinching the 2011 French Open title, making her China's first grand slam singles champion, and Feng hopes her win can have a similar impact on golf's popularity in the country. ""Hopefully it's going to help golf in China because I want to be Li Na for golf in China,"" the 22-year-old told the LPGA's official website. ""I want to be like a model that the other juniors can follow my steps and get on the LPGA. ""It is amazing. I think I'm just lucky. There are good players from China, young players, right now. I became the first one, but I'm sure there will be a second, third, more people winning in the States and winning majors."" Feng, who has risen to fifth in the world rankings following her success, revealed how she focused on improving her short game during the offseason. ""I think I've always been a good ball striker, but my short game is usually a little weak,"" she said. ""So there in the offseason I focused on practicing short game like chipping and putting, and I think it worked."" Feng finished six under for the tournament ahead of a four-way tie for second. Japan's Mika Miyazato, 2011 Kraft Nabisco champion Stacy Lewis, Norway's world No. 4 Suzann Pettersen and 2009 U.S. Open winner Eun-Hee Ji of South Korea were all on four under.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy's grip on the world number one spot in golf loosened Friday after a disastrous seven-over-par 79 at the European Tour's PGA Championship at Wentworth saw the Northern Irishman miss the cut. McIlroy had cut a frustrated and angry figure during an opening 74, but after a solid start to his second round he dropped a string of shots on the back nine. It opens the door for England's Luke Donald, who needs to finish in the top-eight in the Tour's flagship event to reclaim top spot. Donald, who is the defending champion, carded a second straight 68 to share second place on eight-under-par with Scot David Drysdale. They both trail runaway leader James Morrison who carded a superb eight-under 64 in calmer morning conditions to lead at halfway on 12-under 132. McIlroy faced an uphill battle to make the cut, but had recovered to stand one-under for the day through the seventh. But a double bogey on the eighth started the rot and he proceeded to card five straight bogeys and another double bogey on the 15th. For the 23-year-old, who also missed the cut at the Players Championship on the PGA Tour, it is hardly ideal preparation for his defense of the U.S. Open title next month. ""It's been a week I'd like to forget. It's not nice to play like this and not nice two weeks in a row. Maybe it's a good thing I have two days off to practice and I'm looking to getting back to the States next week,"" he told gathered reporters. Donald, who can benefit the most from McIlroy's implosion, insisted that repeating his 2011 success on the Surrey course was his first priority. ""To be honest, the focus is always to try and win the tournament,"" he told the official European Tour website. Morrison, who lives nearby, is looking to add to his 2010 Madeira Open success and finished in fine style with an eagle. A fine all-round sportsman, he played in the England under-17 cricket team with current Test players Alastair Cook and Tim Bresnan, but has never regretted turning to golf full time. ""Playing golf is better than standing in the field all day,"" he jokingly told reporters. Peter Lawrie of Ireland and Spain's Alvaro Quiros shared fourth spot on seven-under. World No.3 Lee Westwood was among a number of star players to struggle in blustery afternoon conditions and was right on the cut line at one-over 145.","Rory McIlroy misses cut at European Tour's PGA Championship at Wentworth .

"(CNN) -- Francesco Molinari shot the lowest round ever at Castle Stuart in Inverness to lead after the first day of the Scottish Open on 10-under 62. Defending champion, and world number one, Luke Donald carded a five-under-par 67 to trail the Italian by five shots Thursday. Molinari is continuing his great form from the French Open, where he finished second, to put himself amongst the contenders for next week's British Open as well as cementing his place in the Ryder Cup team. On his recent form, the Italian admitted, ""I know it's not going to last forever, but I hope to keep this going a little bit longer -- obviously next week, but the next month or so is really big for the Ryder Cup. That, probably more than the Open, is in my mind."" Molinari shot 10 birdies as he stormed into the lead and he later dedicated the performance to his brother, Edoardo. The older Molinari recently had wrist surgery and is likely to miss the entire summer. Francesco said afterwards, ""It would be nice to do well this week for him as well -- to cheer him up a little bit."" Englishman Luke Donald was making his first appearance since his U.S. Open disaster, when he missed the cut after finishing 11 over from 36 holes. Donald told AFP: ""Overall, it's a pretty satisfying start after being away from the game for three weeks so to come back and find some form pretty early on is encouraging."" Like the Italian leader, American Phil Mickelson will have an eye on September's Ryder Cup, but endured a round to forget on the links course. The big American has left his family on holiday in Italy to get some more playing time ahead of Royal Lytham, but his 73 left him 11 shots behind Molinari. Last year's British Open runner-up started well with two birdies in his first three holes. However, the 42-year-old went on to hit three bogeys and managed a seven on the 12th. Spaniard Alejandro Canizares had a day to remember after hitting birdies on the final six holes to finish two off the lead.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods is a long way from matching Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major titles, but he is still in with a chance of equaling the golf legend's mark of 73 PGA Tour victories on Sunday. When Woods shared the early lead during Saturday's third round of the Memorial Tournament, an event founded by Nicklaus and played on a course designed by the legendary the ""Golden Bear,"" it seemed the script had already been written. However, the 14-time major champion faded on the back nine with bogeys at 16 and 18 to finish the day four shots behind fellow American Spencer Levin. ""I've still got a lot of work to do tomorrow. Conditions will again be very difficult, so I'll need to grind it out,"" Woods said after signing for a one-over-par 73, his worst round of the week at Muirfield Village. ""I'm a little tired, but so be it. I had my opportunities but I missed a few putts I should have made. I'm still in the ball game, and anything can happen."" PGA Tour latest leaderboard . Woods has struggled in his last three starts after ending his long wait for his 72nd title with victory at Bay Hill in late March, but he carded solid rounds of 70 and 69 to be just one shot off the lead at the halfway stage in Dublin, Ohio. A birdie at the first hole put him level at the top, but four bogeys left him facing an uphill battle to move level with Nicklaus, who is second on the all-time list behind Sam Snead's 82 wins. Levin, by contrast, has only ever won on the Canadian Tour.

"(CNN) -- Mark Boucher has revealed that his hopes of returning to competitive cricket following a serious eye injury are ""unlikely"" in the near future. Boucher, whose 147 Test match caps is a record for a wicketkeeper, lost the lens, iris and pupil in his left eye after being struck by a bail during South Africa's tour of England in July. The 35-year-old has undergone numerous medical procedures since the incident and had hoped to continue his career playing for the Cape Cobras in his homeland. But he ruled out a speedy comeback as he does not want to risk any further damage to his eye. ""It has been a difficult time for me mentally and physically,"" Boucher said in statement on Wednesday. ""I have lost the lens, iris and pupil in my left eye. There was severe damage to my retina. I have had two major operations and four blood draining operations in the past three weeks and physically, at times, I have been in a lot of pain. ""It is unlikely that I will play any professional cricket again in the near future, which is very unfortunate as I was looking forward to contributing as a player for the Cobras."" Boucher made his Test debut for South Africa in 1997 and went on to score 5,515 runs and claim a record 555 dismissals for the Proteas before being forced to call time on his international career last month. He said he was initially unsure what had happened to him during the match in Taunton. ""All I felt was a bail hitting my eye,"" he told CNN. ""Jacques (Kallis), who was standing at slip, seems to think that the ball actually helped the bail into my eye. I knew I was in trouble when my head hit the floor. ""I knew some fluid was coming out of my eye. I thought it might have been blood ... when I saw there was no blood in it and there was sort of white stuff coming out of it I knew I was in a bit of trouble."" The Cape Province native initially prepared himself for the worst where his eye was concerned, but he is now feeling positive about his ongoing recovery. ""When I first went to hospital the doctor said, 'Listen, you know your eye is pretty messed up. I asked him to be honest with me and he said to me, 'It's too early to say, but be mindful you might never get vision back in your eye.' ""The pupil can be replaced, the iris can be replaced, the cornea can be replaced, the retina can be replaced. The biggest thing is the retina; that is mine and the doctor's biggest worry."" Boucher said many people had expressed sympathy for the sudden end to his top-level career. ""A lot of people have said to me, 'Shame, I feel sorry for you.' If you would have told me at the beginning of my career I would have played 147 Test matches I would have taken it! ""I had plans, hopefully with both eyes working, to do quite a lot of things. I believe you get dealt certain cards that you might not enjoy, but things you can handle and I know I can handle this. ""Yes it's going to be tough, tough on me, tough on a few other people.

"(CNN) -- Rickie Fowler rode the momentum from his first PGA Tour win to storm into contention at the Players Championship on Saturday with a 6-under 66 in the third round. The 23-year-old holed seven birdies with the only blemish coming on the 18th where he missed a 4-foot par putt to leave him 9 under for the tournament, three shots behind leader Kevin Na. Fowler won a playoff against world No. 1 Rory McIlroy at Quail Hollow last Sunday to win his first PGA Tour title after three runner-up finishes. The in-form American will be back in his familiar orange outfit for the final round on Sunday as he looks for back-to-back wins. He would be the first player to do that in consecutive weeks on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods in 2009. ""I had some fun out there today,"" Fowler said after the shooting the lowest round of the day. ""I mean, other than bogeying the last, I'd have to say it was a fairly perfect round."" Fowler wasn't the only player to have problems on the tricky par par-4 18th. Charlie Wi and Adam Scott both double-bogeyed there to ruin promising rounds. Australian Scott is on 4-under, with Wi a shot better off. Na, though, ensured he took the outright lead heading into the final round by holing a 16-foot birdie putt at the last. The 28-year-old American had appeared nervy at times, taking numerous practice strokes before some of his shots and severely testing the patience of the timekeepers, but he enjoyed a bogey-free round of 68 to put him on 12 under. ""I'm fighting with my balance over the ball. There's a lot going on and it's really hard for me to feel comfortable,"" he said. ""It's really frustrating for me too. All I can do is try my best and do what is best for me to play well."" Na's nerves will be further tested on Sunday when he targets the $1.7m on offer to the winner at Sawgrass. Matt Kuchar, who had shared the overnight lead with Zach Johnson and Na on 8-under, is one shot further back after mixing four bogeys with seven birdies for a 69. Harris English slumped out of contention with a 7-over 79. The 22-year-old rookie began the day a shot off the lead but hit a spectator on the head with his tee shot at the first and the shock seemed to unsettle him. He triple-bogeyed the next hole, double-bogeyed the fifth and had four other bogeys in a disastrous round. Woods had found some encouraging form in the second round with a run of four straight birdies moving him up the leaderboard but the former No. 1 didn't back it up on Saturday, an even-par 72 leaving him on 2-under for the tournament. ""I played well today and didn't get anything out of that round,"" Woods said. ""It was probably the most solid I've hit the golf ball all year actually.

"(CNN) -- The world's top golfers will play together at next week's U.S. Open as organizers have chosen to bring together big names for the season's second major. Top-ranked Luke Donald will line up with defending champion Rory McIlroy and No. 3 Lee Westwood for the first two rounds at San Francisco's Olympic Club next Thursday and Friday. And in another stellar group, 14-time major winner Tiger Woods will play with Masters champion Bubba Watson and five-time U.S. Open runner-up Phil Mickelson -- ranked fourth, fifth and 12th respectively. Woods comes into the tournament on the back of his 73rd PGA Tour victory at the Memorial Tournament, where he tied its host Jack Nicklaus in second place on the all-time list behind Sam Snead. The former world No. 1's last major win came at the 2008 U.S. Open, when he triumphed in a playoff despite a serious knee injury. Four-time major winner Mickelson pulled out of last week's Ohio event after shooting 79 in his opening round, citing fatigue after a hectic schedule including his wife's 40th birthday. Mickelson's rivalry with Woods has provided many of golf's great moments in the past two decades. They played together at Torrey Pines in 2008 when Woods won his fourth U.S. Open, but their last pairing at a major was the 2009 Masters -- where Mickelson was fifth and Woods tied sixth. Watson has played only twice since April's Augusta triumph, finishing 18th in New Orleans and then missing the cut at Muirfield Village last week. McIlroy also missed the cut at the Memorial, his third in a row. The Northern Irishman is playing at the St. Jude Classic in Memphis this week, and carded a two-under par 68 in his opening round on Thursday. It left him in touch with the early leaders, but the 23-year-old reach just half of his greens in regulation and found less than half of his fairways in the first round. St. Jude Classic leaderboard . He will need to be more accurate at the tree-lined Olympic Club, which has been totally revamped since it hosted the U.S. Open in 1998 and is expected to provide a stern test. If he wins in Memphis, he will take back the top spot from Donald. Donald has taken a break this week after finishing 12th at the Memorial, and he will be seeking his first major along with fellow Englishman and former world No. 1 Westwood. Westwood is playing at the European Tour's Scandinavian Masters in Sweden, where he has a three-stroke lead at the halfway stage. The 39-year-old shot 64 in his second round on Thursday as he seeks his third victory at the event, having won it in 2000 and 1996 -- his first professional title. In other notable groups next week, McIlroy's compatriot Graeme McDowell -- the 2010 U.S. Open champion -- will play with 2003 winner Jim Furyk and another former world No. 2, Sergio Garcia of Spain. South Africa's two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie Els will play with 2006 winner Geoff Ogilvy of Australia and Argentina's Angel Cabrera, who won it in 2007 and the Masters two years later. U.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love came through Monday's qualifying and will line up alongside Ireland's three-time major champion Padraig Harrington and fellow American veteran David Toms. Retief Goosen, another South African to have won the tournament twice, will play with former world No. 1 Vijay Singh and 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson, who has won once on the PGA Tour this season. There will be an all-South Korean grouping consisting of eight-time PGA Tour winner K.J. Choi, fellow veteran Y.E. Yang (who famously headed off Woods to take the 2009 PGA Championship) and promising 25-year-old K.T. Kim -- who played for the International team at last year's Presidents Cup. The field also includes Casey Martin, who came through qualifying this week to earn his first major start since 1998.

"(CNN) -- It was another bad day at the office for Tiger Woods as he shot a two-over-par 74 in his opening round at the Players Championship Thursday.

World number seven Woods, a 14-time major champion who still dreams of breaking Jack Nicklaus' record of 18, endured a torrid time as he seeks to return to the consistency that made him virtually unbeatable a few years back. The 36-year-old broke a 17-month drought in March with victory at Bay Hill but came to TPC Sawgrass -- where his only win was back in 2001 -- in poor form having missed the cut at Quail Hollow, only the eighth time that has happened in his career. Tiger Woods hits back at his critics . But after another bad opening round Woods may well miss the cut again. ""It wasn't certainly the most positive start,"" Woods told reporters. ""Any kind of momentum that I would build, I would shoot myself in the foot on the very next hole. Just one of those days. ""I didn't get a lot out of that round. I just didn't score. I hit decent shots in there and just got some of the worst lies."" Players Championship leaderboard . Woods had claimed before Quail Hollow that he had put his problem swing behind him and was slowly building back towards something approaching his best. ""Just be patient with it. Just keep plugging along,"" he said. ""In the last few months, I've put together some good rounds, won a couple tournaments, so it's there. I just need to continue doing it."" Meanwhile the man who was once lambasted for suggesting -- while Woods was at the peak of his powers and seemingly untouchable -- that he could one day challenge golf's most enigmatic player is leading the tournament. Poulter shot a magnificent seven-under 65, dropping just one shot the entire round. ""It felt real solid,"" the Englishman told the PGA's official website. ""I got off to a nice start, hit a few good shots early on ... then four birdies in a row from nine."" And the secret of Poulter's round? According to the Englishman it was to play less golf. ""I've been busy at home, new house to move in to, stuff to occupy my mind,"" he explained. ""And when I haven't been (moving house), I've been hitting some balls ... My time on the range has been a small but concentrated effort."" Poulter was joined at the top by Scotland's Martin Laird, who also birdied the notoriously difficult ""island"" par-three 17th hole -- which cost two-time major champion Angel Cabrera nine shots on Thursday. Laird,, a two-time winner on the PGA Tour whose last victory came at Bay Hill in 2011, completed a flawless round to be one shot clear of American Blake Adams. Compatriots Kevin Na and Ben Crane both finished with five-under 67s, while Matt Kuchar, Bill Haas, Ben Curtis and Australia's Adam Scott were in a group of 11 players on 68.","Tiger Woods slumps to a two-over 72 in first round of Players Championship .

"(CNN) -- Her uncle is one of the greatest the game has ever seen, winning 14 majors to date. Now Cheyenne Woods is embarking on her quest to dominate the world of women's golf just like Tiger did in the men's arena. The 21-year-old has signed with the same Excel agency that represents Tiger and announced her intention to turn professional after excelling in the amateur ranks. ""I am really looking forward to pursuing my goals and dreams to compete on the highest level,"" she said in a statement on the PGA Tour's website. ""As I begin my professional career, I am confident and excited about working with Excel as they help shape my future, both personally and professionally."" Woods was schooled at Wake Forest in North Carolina and set the record for lowest career scoring average. She was a two-time All-American and three-time All-Atlantic Coast Conference team member. Cheyenne is the daughter of Tiger's half-brother Earl Dennison Woods Jr. and can boast 30 victories in amateur tournaments. Her first professional tournament came in 2009 at the Wegmans LPGA Championship in New York where she missed the cut by four strokes. Agent Mark Steinberg, who has represented Tiger since 1998, said: ""We are excited about the opportunity to represent Cheyenne. She had an outstanding career at Wake Forest and has the chance to be a major star on the women's golf scene."" Tiger won his 14 majors in a ten-year period but has struggled to maintain the heights he reached after he was engulfed in a sex scandal in 2009. His last major victory came at the U.S. Open in 2008 and though he recently won his first PGA Tour tournament in 30 months he recorded his worst ever finish at the Masters last month, ending on five-over-par. But at a press conference to promote the upcoming AT&T National tournament, Woods said his game is heading in the right direction. ""I'm going to try and continue to improve in incremental steps in every facet of my game and try to make every facet of my game more efficient,"" he said. ""I've just played three events -- I won a tournament (four) tournaments ago. If I get more efficient at what I'm doing, then I'm going to win golf tournaments.""

"(CNN) -- There will be many star golfers swinging irons at the Olympic Club starting Thursday, but for the next few days all eyes will be on Tiger Woods. The burning question for many fans watching the action in San Francisco is which Tiger Woods will show up for the U.S. Open. Will it be the resurgent Woods that stormed to a recent victory at the Memorial? Or will it be the injury-plagued, mediocre-putting Woods that has struggled to compete in recent years? Some say Woods' triumphant win at Memorial on June 3, featuring a dazzling shot and his reminiscent fist pump, may foreshadow what will be seen in San Francisco. Can Tiger Woods crack the U.S. Open's 'graveyard of champions?' ""Tiger's performance at Memorial bodes well for him at the U.S. Open,"" said Peter Dixon, a golf correspondent for British newspaper The Times. ""He seems to have got his swing under control and is now able to move the ball in both directions -- which will be needed at the Olympic Club."" The Tiger Woods' fall-from-grace story has been told and retold so many times that some have been looking for the once-dominant golfer to write a new chapter. Woods looks like he is ready, according to some golf journalists. U.S. Open latest scores . ""He has lost a lot of his aura, but some of it is coming back,"" Dixon said. ""He is strutting around again and looks as if he believes he is the man to beat."" At one point in his career, Woods seemed a lock to smash Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major titles. Photos: Golf's young prodigies . Although his last major win was at the 2008 U.S. Open, Woods says he considers this tournament a real challenge. ""This is the hardest test that we play every year. What makes it difficult is that we play different venues every year,"" the 14-time major champion told reporters. Along with Woods, oddsmakers say that Luke Donald, Steve Stricker or Phil Mickelson, who holds the record for most second-place finishes at the Open, could take the championship. Rory McIlroy, won the U.S. Open last year, but the young golfer has been plagued with his own slump recently, missing three straight cuts.

"(CNN) -- Matt Kuchar took home $1.7 million, the biggest prize in golf, for winning the Players Championship. It lifted him to a career-high fifth in the world rankings, but most importantly his family was there to see it. The American's wife and two young sons raced onto the green after he clinched his fourth PGA Tour victory, and biggest by far. Also at TPC Sawgrass on Sunday were his dad and mom, who live nearby in Ponte Vedra Beach. ""It's such an amazing feeling -- playing amongst the game's best, to come out on top, to do it on Mother's Day, staying here with Mom and Dad, with my wife and two kids here ... it really is magical,"" Kuchar said on the PGA Tour website. Kuchar, a top amateur who has never exploded on the professional scene, is known as one of golf's nice guys, a Mr. Consistent who has made the halfway cut in his past 17 starts and tied for third at the Masters in April. It didn't even bother him that his final-round partner was Kevin Na, the third-round leader who was battling inner demons and heckling from the crowd as he struggled to get around the course in his allotted time. ""I feel like I'm so lucky to be doing what I do. I'm out there, I'm enjoying myself, having a good time. The smile is there because I'm having a good time, because I'm loving playing golf,"" Kuchar rold reporters. ""Kevin knows that he's fighting some demons with pulling the trigger, and in trying to help himself, he walks really fast. So he tries to offset his difficulty in actually hitting the ball by walking fast, getting up to his ball and trying to keep a similar pace of play."" South Korea-born Na, who is a naturalized American, collapsed with a closing 76 to finish tied for seventh -- five shots behind Kuchar. ""I deserve it,"" Na said of the booing. ""I mean, I'm being honest. But is it fair? No. You put an average guy in between those ropes, trust me, they won't even pull it back."" Na had little sympathy from Tiger Woods, who suggested penalty strokes for slow players. ""Strokes is money. What people don't realize is that one shot is so valuable out here,"" the 2001 Players champion said after finishing tied for 40th, having closed with 73. TPC Sawgrass is one of the toughest courses on the circuit, and even leading players such as Rory McIlroy struggle there. The U.S. Open champion missed the halfway cut for the third time at the $9.5 million tournament, but retained the No. 1 ranking after Luke Donald finished only sixth despite a closing 66. The Englishman was two shots behind a group of four tied for second, including last weekend's Quail Hollow winner Rickie Fowler, Texas Open champion Ben Curtis, 2007 Masters victor Zach Johnson and Scotland's Martin Laird. But the spoils went to Kuchar, who claimed his first win since The Barclays in 2010 and can now take his place among some legendary names to have triumphed at the Players. ""I think one of the things that strikes me is walking every day through the champions' tunnel,"" he said. ""Every player does it. And for me, I can't help but stop and gaze at all the photos going through champions tunnel, and to think I'm going to be a part of that with Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino and Raymond Floyd and Phil Mickelson and David Duval and Tiger Woods, it's all the best of the best.

"(CNN) -- When Jack Nicklaus gives you advice, it pays to listen. Rory McIlroy did so last year, and he won his first major tournament. Now, having missed three cuts in a row ahead of his U.S. Open title defense next week, the world No. 2 has again acted on the wisdom of one of golf's greatest champions. McIlroy had intended to pay his first visit to the host course, San Francisco's Olympic Club, just days before the season's second major tees off. But after a joint interview with Nicklaus, hosted by Shane O'Donoghue of CNN's Living Golf show, the 23-year-old decided to go there early and use the free window that opened up when he missed the weekend action at the Memorial Tournament run by the ""Golden Bear."" McIlroy had planned to go straight from Muirfield Village to Memphis for this week's St. Jude Classic in the hope that more competitive play would help restore the form that has made him the world's most exciting young player. But it was Nicklaus, winner of a record 18 major titles and joined by Tiger Woods on Sunday in second place on the PGA Tour roll of honor with 73 victories, pointed him in the right direction. ""My wife has always had a statement, which is: 'There is no excuse for not being prepared,' "" the 72-year-old said. ""I know that there were times when I wasn't prepared and I got exactly what I deserved -- nothing."" Woods revealed after his victory on Sunday that he had visited Olympic before the Memorial, and that it had been perfect preparation. ""Not to disparage the Memphis tournament, but nobody remembers who won last year in Memphis. They do remember who won last year's U.S. Open. We will never forget that,"" Nicklaus said. After self-destructing in the final round at last year's Masters, McIlroy turned to Nicklaus for advice. ""I said it is really important to know what happened and that you understand what happened to you and that you will try not to make the same mistakes,"" Nicklaus said. ""I said that I had given away a U.S. Open where Arnold (Palmer) won, I gave away a British Open by not knowing how to win and I gave away another U.S. Open not knowing how to win -- but I learned from it. ""Then he went right on to win a U.S. Open and absolutely blitz the field. I dropped him a note saying that you obviously learned something in Augusta, but more important did you learn something from your win? ""The two are a combination and are very important to his career. He has a great, great future in front of him."" McIlroy won by eight shots at Congressional, setting the lowest score in U.S. Open history as he smashed the previous best total set by Nicklaus, Woods, Lee Janzen and Jim Furyk. ""I know Jack always went to the tournament's venue a week before and spent four or five days there to prepare,"" McIlroy acknowledged. ""I think the reason that he won many more majors than anyone else was because he prepared more than anyone else. ""You know when he stood on the first tee on Thursday he felt like he was better prepared than anyone else -- that in itself gives you confidence."" Time will tell if McIlroy's last-minute change of plans will solve his problems, but Nicklaus is confident that the Northern Irishman will soon be back on track. ""Rory right now is worrying how he is going to put that back together, but we all go through it,"" he said. ""I had the same problems. I went from 1967 to 1970 right in the prime of my career without winning a major. And you know I just found that I was probably lazy, I had too much success, I hadn't worked hard enough to prepare myself. ""I just worked myself out of it, then in 1970 I had success at the British Open and I was back again.""","Jack Nicklaus tells Rory McIlroy to spend more time at U.S. Open venue .

"(CNN) -- Marcel Siem held his nerve amid a late charge from Francesco Molinari to take the Open de France -- his first European Tour title for eight years. The German finished on eight-under-par, one shot better than Molinari who recorded a final-round 64 on Sunday, the lowest score of the week at Le Golf National in Paris. The Italian was six shots off the pace prior to Sunday's finale and double bogeyed the first hole but went on to make nine birdies. But Siem held held firm, despite a dropped shot on the 18th, to take his second title on the European Tour, and his first since the 2004 Dunhill Championship. ""I'm so happy. This means a lot to me,"" Siem told the European Tour's official website after picking up a check for $640,000. ""First, after eight years it doesn't matter what kind of tournament you won; it's huge, because you've got the confidence again. ""Every time I've played consistent golf this year, and there were so many times up there, I couldn't make it. Stupid things happened the whole time. ""It means so much to me to win after that long stretch. It's all about winning in the end and it puts so much pressure every time you don't win and people start talking, you will never win again and stuff like that, so it's very important for me. ""I love this golf course. I always loved it and I love it even more or even better now. I'm super happy."" Molinari hit just 29 shots on his closing nine holes and despite missing out on the title, he was delighted with his form. ""It's been just an unbelievable day really,"" he said. ""I had a really bad start, but two years ago when I finished second here, I doubled the first on the last day. ""From then on, it was just great golf. I had a couple of good breaks and finally a lot of putts going in the hole. ""I was in the moment, in the zone and I wasn't really counting the birdies. The game has been feeling well all week and everything was coming out perfect."" World No. 3 Lee Westwood shot a closing round of 70 to finish 40th a day after an injury scare nearly forced him out of the tournament. ""The leg is fine - it wasn't a problem today,"" he said, after fears he may have to miss the year's third major, the British Open at Royal Lytham and St. Annes starting on Thursday week. Meanwhile, the U.S. PGA Tour saw a sixth first-time winner this season when rookie Ted Potter Jr. claimed the Greenbrier Classic title after a playoff on Sunday. The 28-year-old beat fellow American Troy Kelly with a four-foot birdie putt at the third extra hole to earn a place at the British Open, the FedEx Cup playoffs and next year's Masters. He also earned a two-year tour exemption plus the financial security of a $1,098,000 windfall as first prize, having shot a second successive six-under 64 to join Kelly on -16 at the end of 72 holes. ""It was just a big relief,"" said the left-hander, who had missed five successive haflway cuts before the West Virginia tournament. ""All the struggles the last few weeks, knowing that now I've got a couple years to try to improve on my game and win some more tournaments."" U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson had led after three rounds, and held a one-shot advantage going into the final nine holes as he did at the Old White TPC course last year, but he faded to a tie for seventh on -11 after three successive bogeys derailed his challenge.","German Marcel Siem wins the Open de France at Le Golf National .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods kept his recent strong play going Thursday, shooting a 1-under 69 to keep him within shouting distance of the leader at the U.S. Open. Michael Thompson held the lead after round one, shooting a 4-under 66 for a three-shot advantage from second-placed Woods, 2010 winner Graeme McDowell, Justin Rose, David Toms and Nick Watney. Thompson, 27, is playing in only his second U.S. Open, having finished tied for 29th in 2008. ""I've got nothing to lose. This is just a bonus in my career,"" said Thompson, who was runner-up at the Olympic Club at the 2007 U.S. Amateur Championship. ""I'm not guaranteed into all the majors as a professional, and to be able to have the opportunity to play is just a wonderful experience."" U.S. Open latest scores . Woods was on his game all day at Olympic's tree-lined Lake Course in San Francisco. He consistently hit fairways and kept the ball out of the rough. He birdied in back-to-back holes late in the round, shots that brought huge applause and subdued fist pumps from Woods. ""I was very pleased,"" Woods told reporters. ""I felt like I had control of my game all day and just stuck to my game plan and executed my game plan."" His play came in stark contrast to the others in his marquee pairing. Woods was grouped with Phil Mickelson and recent Masters champion Bubba Watson, but both golfers struggled mightily and will have to rally on Friday to make the cut. Mickelson, who has been a U.S. Open runner-up five times, shot a 6-over 76. He fell on hard times from the beginning, slicing his opening tee shot into the trees and losing the ball. He had to rally just to get a bogey. He then went on to bogey the next two holes and showcased uneven play the whole round. ""I can't really think about the lead or anything,"" Mickelson told reporters. ""I've just got to make the cut right now, and to do that, I got to shoot something under par."" Watson had even more difficulty shooting a round of 8-over 78. The always-clever Watson commented on his difficulties on his Twitter page. ""I figured out what I did wrong today on the golf course, missed the putt for 77. #goflishard,"" Watson tweeted hours after he had finished Thursday. Another big story of the first round was 14-year-old Andy Zhang who became the youngest golfer to ever compete in the U.S. Open. Zhang started out a little shaky starting with a triple bogey, then a double bogey and then three more bogeys in a row. But the teen settled himself and with a beautiful play at the end of the round became the youngest player to hit a birdie in the U.S. Open. He finished with a 9-over 79, which left him level with world No. 1 Luke Donald and U.S. Open champion Michael Campbell in a tie for 140th in the 156-man field. Defending U.S. Open champ Rory McIlroy stumbled in the first round, as the world No. 2 carded 7-over 77. Can Tiger Woods crack the U.S. Open's 'graveyard of champions?' It was a tough day for the world's top three players, with Englishman Lee Westwood faring the best as he shot 73 to be tied for 40th. Casey Martin, playing his first major tournament in 14 years since his controversial debut at the same venue, was tied for 52nd. The 40-year-old American, who needs to use a golf cart due to a birth defect which causes pain in his right leg, carded six bogeys and two birdies in his 74. ""I tried to realize there's really not that much pressure on me, but it didn't work,"" said Martin, now a university golf coach who came through regional qualifying last week. ""I want to enjoy it.

"(CNN) -- Scotland's first minister Alex Salmond has warned American billionaire Donald Trump against interfering in government matters ahead of his controversial golf course opening . The Trump International Golf Links, which the tycoon hopes will become the world's best course, is due to open in Aberdeenshire on July 10, but plans for an adjoining hotel have been shelved due to a row over the development of a nearby offshore wind farm. Trump claims he was misled by Salmond over the American's $1 billion project and has threatened to sue the Scottish government if the wind farm development is not abandoned. But Salmond, who has welcomed the golf course's construction, told Trump not to interfere in Scotland's energy policy. Who will golf's run of new major winners . ""Donald Trump is building a fantastic golf course in Scotland that I very much support and I've been a great supporter of it,"" Salmond told CNN at the TED Global conference in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh. ""Unfortunately, recently, he has tried to tell the Scottish Government how to run our energy policy. ""So, I suppose the message I have to say is, yes to great golf courses, we have the greatest golf courses in the world in Scotland and one more won't do any harm, but let the democratically elected government of Scotland decide its own energy policy."" In April, Trump appeared in the Scottish parliament to express his opposition to the North Sea wind farm. Salmond has questioned the strategy of Trump, who will open his new course with a ceremony including local golf stars such as Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie, to potentially pursue legal action against the Scottish government. ""We are a free society in Scotland, people are free to do as they choose,"" he said. ""The track record of taking legal action against a democratically elected government, pursuing the policy on which it was elected, in the Scottish courts would not be a propitious one. But nonetheless people are free to do what they wish."" Designed by leading golf architec Martin Hawtree, the Menie course has been built on a site of special scientific interest after the Scottish government overruled Aberdeenshire council's decision to reject the American's project, arguing the economic benefits outweighed environmental concerns.

"(CNN) -- Two of the world's top golfers have backed the R & A's decision to embrace technology by allowing spectators to bring mobile phones into this week's British Open. The R & A, golf's rulemakers outside of the United States and Mexico and organizers of the sport's oldest major, have relented on a ban on phones which had been in place since 2006. World No. 3 Lee Westwood, searching for his first triumph in one of golf's four majors in front of his home fans, says the ban was unrealistic in the modern age. ""We live in times when the mobile phone is a key tool in business affairs so I think we might deter people from attending if there is a ban,"" the 39-year-old, who has over 450,000 followers on Twitter, said in quotes released to CNN ahead of the 141st British Open. ""Obviously you don't want them ringing when you are about to take a shot, but in general golf followers tend to be mindful of a player's needs."" Australia's Adam Scott has also backed the R & A's decision, but warned that fans will need to use their phones responsibly. ""Cell phones or smart phones are a part of life these days,"" said the world No.13 ahead of the tournament at The Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club on England's west coast. ""I don't have a problem with it. I just hope all spectators at the Open are considerate towards the players and put them on silent."" R & A head of communications Malcolm Booth explained how mobile phone use will only be allowed in specific zones, and that the move is part of the British Open welcoming new technology. ""It's absolutely something we're embracing,"" Booth told CNN. ""We're not naÃ¯ve or blind to the potential issues it could cause or the challenges which come with this policy. ""But we're excited our spectators will have access to more information than they've ever had on a golf course before. That can only heighten the experience of the Open championship."" The subject of mobile phone use during golf tournaments was raised after both four-time major winner Phil Mickelson and 2012 Masters champion Bubba Watson complained of spectators taking pictures during June's Memorial Tournament. Despite the complaints from high-profile players, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem outlined how no ban on phones at events would be implemented. Booth is hoping new technology designed for the British Open, which was won by Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke in 2011, will enhance the spectator experience. ""New for this year we have an ipad application,"" added Booth. ""Allowing our spectators to have handheld devices on the golf course allows them to have up-to-the-minute scores. ""There is a new course guide we have for this year which uses GPS technology to show spectators and people who aren't at the event exactly where different groups are on the golf course."" ""We're also going to have live coverage available in the UK through our apps, which is an exciting development.""

"(CNN) -- Three starts and three missed cuts. Rory McIlroy has a lot of hard work to do before he begins the defense of his U.S. Open title later this month. The world's No. 2 golfer crashed out of weekend contention at the PGA Tour's Memorial Tournament after a second-round 79 on Friday that left him 12 shots behind halfway leader Rory Sabbatini of South Africa. ""I don't feel like the scores are actually reflecting how I'm hitting the ball,"" the Northern Irishman told reporters. ""I was able to string nine good holes together yesterday. ""I just need to keep working on it and try and string 18 good holes together and then try and string two days together and obviously three days and ultimately four. PGA Tour latest leaderboard . ""But I hit some good shots out there. I'm definitely hitting the ball better than I did last week, so I can see an improvement there. But I've still got a long way to go."" The last time McIlroy missed three cuts in a row was in 2008 as a 19-year-old playing on the European Tour. He has committed to the U.S. circuit this year and next week will play the St. Jude Classic in Memphis, a tournament he added to his schedule only after his second-round 79 at the European Tour's flagship PGA Championship last weekend. After Memphis comes the U.S. Open at the Olympic Club in San Francisco for the second major tournament of the golf season. 'Mentally fatigued' Mickelson withdraws from Memorial . The event's course layouts are notoriously testing, but Luke Donald -- who has swapped the No. 1 ranking regularly with McIlroy this year -- believes the 23-year-old is close to regaining the form that has led many pundits to describe him as the next Tiger Woods. ""He's obviously frustrated -- this game does that to you,"" the Englishman said. ""He's not far away. He made a couple of careless errors, but I'm sure once he posts one solid run of maybe a couple of rounds or a tournament this will be a blur and he'll forget about it quickly."" Donald, who played the first two rounds at the Memorial's Muirfield Village with McIlroy, was six shots behind Sabbatini in a tie for 27th after a 73 on Friday. Sabbatini, seeking his seventh PGA Tour title after a poor start to 2012, had a one-shot lead after carding a second successive 69. That scored was matched by Woods, who is hoping to tie Jack Nicklaus on 73 wins at a course designed by the ""Golden Bear."" Woods was tied for second with fellow Americans Spencer Levin (72) and Scott Stallings (73) on five-under 139 overall. ""The things that I'm supposed to be doing for the past few tournaments, I was able to do,"" said Woods, who has struggled in his past three starts since ending his long wait for a 72nd title at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in late March. However, he has never missed successive cuts in his professional career. ""This is the way that I hit the ball at Bay Hill and the way I hit it at the end of last year. That's what's exciting about it,"" Woods added.","Rory McIlroy seeking to reverse poor run of results ahead of U.S. Open starting June 14 .

"(CNN) -- England's Danny Willett recorded his maiden European Tour victory after a marathon sudden death playoff against Marcus Fraser of Australia at the BMW International Open in Cologne Sunday. The 24-year-old Willett won at the fourth extra hole, taking advantage after Fraser missed a three foot putt for par. Former Walker Cup star Willett, in his fourth year on the Tour, had 19 top-10 finishes in his professional career without clinching victory going into the tournament. ""It's amazing,"" he told the official European Tour website. ""It was a tough day -- it was brutal with the wind whipping and it was raining. ""Marcus had a great round today and I hung in there nicely. Hopefully I gave people a good show."" Willett was as good as his word, but it needed a miraculous shot on the 18th to seal a playoff with Fraser, a two-time winner on the European Tour. Fraser had set a clubhouse target of 11 under after a bogey of his own on the last. Willett needed a par to match him and after his drive ended behind a tree it looked unlikely. But he produced a sensational hooked iron shot to reach the green and two putts later forced extra holes. Willett missed a five-footer for victory on the first sudden death hole, but eventually was left to celebrate a breakthrough triumph. Tied for third, one shot adrift were Ireland's Paul McGinley, Spaniard Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano and England's Chris Wood. On the PGA Tour, England's Brian Davis and Roland Thatcher were leading the $6 million Travelers Championship going into Sunday's final round. Davis shot a six-under 64 to reach 12-under 198 after 54 holes, while Thatcher carded a 65. There was an emotional win on the Ladies European Tour as England's Melissa Reid won the Prague Masters Sunday, just a month after her mother Joy was killed in a car crash in Germany. Reid rolled home a six-footer on the final hole to hold off Italian Diana Luna, before breaking into tears and being comforted by fellow competitors and friends. ""To be honest I wasn't that nervous. I think with something like what's happened to my family and me the last four weeks nothing really seems that difficult anymore,"" Reid told AFP.","Danny Willett wins BMW International Open in Cologne after sudden death playoff .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has added to his tournament workload as he bids to return to winning ways in the majors this season. The 36-year-old American is stalled on 14 major titles -- four short of the all-time record held by Jack Nicklaus -- since his U.S. Open triumph in 2008. His career has been interrupted by injury and well publicized problems in his personal life, but this year Woods returned to top form with victory in the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill. But disappointing showings at Quail Hollow, where he missed the cut, and the U.S. Masters and Players Championship have taken the shine off that win as he heads into the big tournaments this summer. Woods announced on his official website that he will play in the Greenbrier Classic for the first time before heading for the British Open at Royal Lytham in July. His arch-rival Phil Mickelson will also tee it up on the Old White TPC course which saw Australian Stuart Appleby shoot a remarkable 59 in 2010 to win the tournament. Woods, who has won 72 times on the PGA Tour, has previously built his preparation for majors around a restricted schedule of select tournaments, but earlier this season he sprang another surprise by playing in the Honda Classic for the first time since his teenage years. ""I'm excited about my schedule and looking forward to competing,"" said Woods, who will next head for the Memorial Tournament, hosted by Jack Nicklaus, which starts on May 31. It will act as a tuneup for the second major of the season in the U.S. Open on the Olympic Course in San Francisco. His preparation events for the British Open will be the AT&T National at Congressional before heading to the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia.","Tiger Woods to play Greenbrier Classic for the first time .

"(CNN) -- There is something deeply unsettling about this prickly, suspenseful first feature from writer director Sean Durkin. Although ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" is set exclusively in bucolic surroundings, on a farm somewhere in the Catskills and in a luxurious lakeside cabin in Connecticut, the film is pregnant with dread. The threat of violence, implied or imagined, haunts its troubled, many-named heroine from the opening minutes, when she makes her bid for freedom. She wakes in the pre-dawn, picks her way out of a slumbering room, heads out the front door and into the trees. But she doesn't get far before someone raises the alarm for ""Marcy May,"" and she breaks into a run. Later, after it seems she's free and clear, the same man catches up with her in at a diner in a nearby town. He sidles up and makes easy conversation. There is no coercion, no physical duress in this public place, but the menace is almost overpowering. And then he leaves. Has she been relinquished? Was she free to leave all along? Marcy May -- or Martha, as she calls herself when she phones for help -- does not believe it. And sensing her traumatized, near-catatonic panic, nor do we. But it's only gradually that we come to comprehend the reasons for her great distress. Durkin (who produced the chilly ""Afterschool"") does a very clever thing here. He cuts between Martha's painfully incremental rehabilitation and recovery at the home rented by her older half-sister and her architect husband (Sarah Paulson and Hugh Dancy), and flashbacks to Martha's induction to the commune from which we've already seen her escape. But the transitions are hard cuts, and often intentionally disorienting, so we're not always immediately sure what's past and present. It's a confusion we share with Martha, who is haunted by nightmares from the farm and acts out in ways that her family is hard-pressed to accept, let alone understand. Durkin gestures here towards a surrealist satire in the culture-clash between the bourgeois sister and the reprogrammed, defiantly anti-materialist, sexually uninhibited Martha -- though it's not clear his heart is really in it. The commune -- which initially seems idyllic and empowering -- gradually reveals its dark side, embodied both in the passive group-think of its members, and most disturbingly of all in the messianic Patrick (John Hawkes). His soft-spoken self-help platitudes are more Dr. Phil than Charles Manson, until he gets to cocking his pistol and teaching the girls how to shoot. Hawkes is equally convincing, whether he's serenading Marcy May on his guitar or blooding her in preparation for a nocturnal raid on the neighboring holiday cottages; a little ad hoc redistribution of wealth to supplement the farm's organic crop -- maybe the one sequence where Durkin, who has a talent for insinuation and withholding, oversteps the mark. But the movie stands or falls on Martha/Marcy May, and Durkin hit paydirt in casting Elizabeth Olsen. The younger sister to Mary Kate and Ashley, the 21-year-old Olsen is sensationally good, flipping between the innocent, impressionable beguilement of Marcy May (as Patrick rechristens her) and Martha's crippling, bed-wetting anxiety and anger. It's a punishing role but a star-making performance, a spellbinding portrait of a shattered young woman who has been systemically and cynically stripped of all autonomy, and who doesn't know if the pieces will ever fit back together again.","Elizabeth Olsen stars in the title role of 'Martha Marcy May Marlene'

"(CNN) -- When Tiger Woods ended his 30-month wait for a PGA Tour title in March, the golf world was excited by the prospect of the 14-time major champion blitzing the Masters field on his old stomping ground at Augusta. He didn't. He flopped, finishing tied for 40th. Woods then missed the cut at Quail Hollow and shared 40th at the Players Championship. So what can we expect at next week's U.S. Open, where he has already been installed as the oddsmakers' favorite after thrilling fans with his 73rd PGA Tour title on Sunday, chipping in with one of the best shots of his career? ""The timing couldn't have been better, it means a lot for him to win in front of his hero Jack Nicklaus,"" says Golf.com deputy editor David Dusek. ""If he plays at that level, if he's able to hit fairways and find the putting stroke that he showed in Ohio, then Tiger Woods is definitely going to be one of the contenders at the U.S. Open."" That can only be good for golf. The PGA Tour's broadcaster CBS Sports reported that Sunday's ratings increased 138% from last year, being the event's best result since 2004. The season's second major will be held at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, where Woods revealed he practiced the week before going to Nicklaus' Memorial Tournament. ""I hit the ball well there. I said, 'Hey, that's as good a prep as any for this event, if I can hit the ball well there.' I just basically carried that into this event and hit it great all week."" Woods acknowledged that his victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational had covered up some of the deficiencies in his game before the Masters as he was still coming to terms with his new swing. ""At Bay Hill I played well on that Sunday, but I just didn't quite have the control I did here. That was different. I'm able to hit the ball, I think, compressing it higher than I did at Bay Hill,"" he told reporters. ""I was comfortable hitting it down, uncomfortable hitting it up. As I said at Augusta to you guys, I got exposed, wasn't able to get the ball up in the air comfortably, and it showed. ""I went to work on it for the next few weeks, and I finally got it. It came around here when I needed it. This is a high-ball golf course. You've got to get the ball up in the air and you've got to land it soft, and I did it."" While the technique being instilled by coach Sean Foley is finally paying off for Woods, Dusek says more importantly the 36-year-old is rediscovering the ""X-Factor"" that made him the world's best-paid athlete. ""He's got his putter going a little bit, he was hitting fairways, and as we saw with that shot on 16 it would be appear that there's a level of magic surrounding this guy that he's able to summon. Not as consistently as he used to, but it's still there,"" Dusek told CNN. ""Obviously the technique has to be there, he has to put the club face on the ball and to execute his shot, but golf probably more than any other sport relies on the proverbial 15th club -- which is the confidence between your ears that you can pull this off. ""Tiger Woods obviously has a lot of confidence right now, and he should -- there's only a couple of other players on the U.S. PGA Tour this season who have two wins, and he's one of them along with Jason Dufner and Hunter Mahan."" Dusek believes that the way is clear for Woods to win his first major title since 2008, when he famously triumphed at the U.S. Open in a playoff despite suffering a serious knee injury that would sideline him for the rest of that year. ""We've seen Rory McIlroy miss three straight cuts, we've seen (world No. 1) Luke Donald not really be much of a factor, and (five-time U.S. Open runner-up) Phil Mickelson having to pull out (at Memorial) citing fatigue,"" Dusek said. ""Tiger Woods then wins his 73rd championship and it's so tantalizing a story that leading up to the U.S. Open next week that his form once again seems to be ramping up."" The tournament was last held at Olympic Club in 1998, when a 23-year-old Woods tied for 18th. ""It's way different than in '98. They've added some serious length there,"" he said. ""We were hitting different clubs off the tees and different sight lines, and they've shifted a couple of the fairways over, and all new green complexes. You know, my book is useless from '98."" So what does Woods think -- is he really back? ""I'll just keep going, keep working on it. This is a process, and I'm just trying to get better.""","Tiger Woods is favorite to win the U.S. Open starting next week in San Francisco .

"(CNN) -- There is much debate in the world of golf as to whether four-time major winner Phil Mickelson deserves his place in the game's Hall of Fame, but journalist David Dusek is in no doubt. The deputy editor of Golf.com has told CNN World Sport there should be no doubt Mickelson's pedigree befits the accolade, calling the 41-year-old one of the best players of his generation. There has been criticism in some quarters that given his age, Mickelson is too young to take his place in the pantheon of greats who have graced the sport despite a 20-year top-level career. Others have pointed to the fact that, incredibly, he has never held the top spot in golf's world rankings. Fowler finally comes of age with first PGA Tour title . But Dusek disagrees and thinks the player -- known affectionately by fans as ""Lefty"" -- still has a few major championships left in the tank. ""Phil absolutely deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. He's one of the great players of his generation,"" Dusek said ahead of Mickelson's induction on Monday. ""He won four major championships in the era when one guy, namely Tiger Woods, won 14 of them. He was well seated at number two in the world for a quite a while. ""The fact that he has been a stalwart of eight Ryder Cup teams, eight Presidents Cup teams, he has 40 (PGA Tour) wins -- all these numbers are Hall of Fame-worthy material."" The debate over Mickelson's worthiness will be replicated in the coming years, according to Dusek, given that Woods reigned supreme over the game for such a long period. ""Tiger has skewed things quite a bit,"" he said. ""If Tiger Woods wasn't there Phil and many other players, like Ernie Els, would have won more titles. ""We're going to run into several players now that will be Hall of Fame candidates in the next few years who were not number one in the world. ""Phil Mickelson is one of the first ones. If you look at the body of work for someone like Mickelson, he definitely gets in. The question mark will come soon. What happens with a player like Jim Furyk or Colin Montgomerie? Bubba Watson: Golf's new genius superstar? ""You're going to have to take into consideration that attaining the world number one ranking from the late 1990s through the late 2000s was going to be very difficult for anyone to do, yet they could be a fantastic golfer and Mickelson fits the bill."" Mickelson was in contention to win a fourth Masters title at Augusta last month, but fell short after a disappointing final round. However, he can still boast one PGA Tour victory this season -- at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am back in February. Dusek believes Mickelson still has the game to challenge for more titles -- and more majors. ""Mickelson showed on the PGA Tour (at Pebble Beach) that he is capable of playing fantastic golf,"" he said. ""The fact his putting has been much, much better this season than it has been for a few seasons is a great sign and certainly when he gets back to Augusta next year he could easily go for a fourth Masters. He could have won this year. ""I would not be the least bit surprised if Phil Mickelson wins another major title, possibly a few more.""","Phil Mickelson is inducted into golf's Hall of Fame on Monday .

"(CNN) -- When Tiger Woods won the Players Championship for the first and only time, he was at the peak of his powers. In 2001, the tournament known as golf's unofficial ""fifth major"" was held the week before the Masters -- and Woods won both events as he became the only modern-day player to hold all four major crowns at the same time, albeit not in a calendar year. This week, at the age of 36 and struggling to rediscover his best form, the American will again line up at TPC Sawgrass -- but without the help of the man who helped him become the dominant force he was: coach Butch Harmon. Already he has had to fend off questions about his painfully long process of swing changes, and a disappointing showing at Augusta last month and then again at Quail Hollow last week, where he missed the halfway cut. Hopes had been raised by his pre-Masters victory at Bay Hill, his first on the PGA Tour in more than two years, but since then his work with current coach Sean Foley has been questioned by former players such as Nick Faldo and Brandel Chamblee, both now TV pundits. Chamblee offered: ""He needs to fire Sean, call Butch. He's literally lost the art of the game, and I think Butch could help him."" Faldo, who unlike Chamblee can call himself a major champion -- six times over -- is troubled by Woods' apparent lack of confidence. ""He just doesn't have the self-belief, the self-confidence that he obviously had, the Tiger of old -- simple as that,"" the Englishman said. Woods, for his part, insists that his work in progress is similar to previous frustrating periods rebuilding his swing with Harmon and then Hank Haney -- and he rebounded from those in a stellar career featuring 14 major titles and more than 80 professional victories. ""I went for probably almost two years without doing much with Butch before it kicked in, and about a year and a half with Hank,"" he told reporters ahead of Thursday's opening round. ""With Sean it's been almost two years. But I've been hurt for a majority of that, so I haven't been able to put in the time. In essence, it takes time. ""The fruits have been pretty good on the back side of it, and I think so far I've shown some nice consistency, and I'm still working. I just haven't had the time because obviously the injuries I've had."" Woods did admit that he might be thinking too much about his game, rather than just playing. ""Certainly it is (like that) when you're making changes,"" he said. ""I've done this before. I've been through this. I went through those periods where I wasn't quite where I wanted to be. I had some pretty good runs after that, and this is no different. ""It takes a little bit of time, and I keep building, and things eventually come around to where they feel natural and efficient. I think that's probably the most important word, is that you get out there and you feel efficient in what you're doing."" Woods' recent performances have highlighted another part of his game that needs work: his putting -- having needed 33 in the second round at Quail Hollow, and also struggling in finishing 40th at Augusta. ""Absolutely. I'm not quite 100% comfortable with it. I've had to make some tweaks and some little bit of changes,"" he said. ""Augusta was nice to have happen, actually, in the big scheme of things. Just like it was at Dubai a couple of years ago when I couldn't cut the golf ball. I felt like I could have won that golf tournament, but not being able to cut it cost me eight or nine shots that week. ""Augusta was one of those things where it was just pretty glaring, some of the things I needed to work on. So get back to work and try and get ready for this week."" Woods will be in a high-profile grouping on Thursday and Friday as he lines up alongside FedEx Cup series leader Hunter Mahan and another ""Golf Boy"" in Rickie Fowler, who won his first PGA Tour title at Quail Hollow last weekend. Rory McIlroy, who returned to world No. 1 by reaching the playoff on Sunday, will partner Steve Stricker and another veteran American, Phil Mickelson -- who was inducted into golf's Hall of Fame on Monday and was champion at Ponte Vedra Beach in 2007. Luke Donald, who the lost the top ranking after skipping Quail Hollow, will play alongside fellow former No. 1 Lee Westwood and 2011 FedEx Cup champion Bill Haas in the $9.5 million Florida tournament. Masters champion Bubba Watson has decided to stay home with his wife and newly-adopted baby son.","Tiger Woods is struggling for form ahead of this week's Players Championship .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rory McIlroy lost his cool in the midst of a heatwave at the BMW PGA Championship as Luke Donald stepped up his challenge to usurp the 2011 U.S. Open champion at the top of the rankings. McIlroy, from Northern Ireland, struggled to a two-over-par round of 74 on the opening day at the Wentworth course while Donald, the defending champion, sits within striking distance of the leaders on four-under. Donald can regain the No. 1 spot with victory at the tournament and must finish in the top eight to have a chance of overtaking McIlroy. His six birdies helped him into a tie for eighth place. Scotland's David Drysdale and Ireland's Peter Lawrie lead on six-under after day one with England's Justin Rose and Alavaro Quiros, from Spain, in a group of five players one shot back. Donald targets No. 1 spot after European Tour award . McIlroy's round included a run of four bogeys in five holes and at one stage he hurled a club to the floor in frustration after a poor shot. ""It's a bit of deja vu from last year,"" he told reporters. ""I kept getting off to good starts and sort of making a few bogeys around the turn and not getting any momentum back. ""Two under through seven, feel like I'm playing well, then I make four bogeys in five holes. It's pretty disappointing and I feel like I'm playing pretty well, I just need to go out there and shoot a score."" McIlroy's compatriot Graeme McDowell's round turned sour shortly after he'd walked off the 18th green as his ball was shown to have moved prior to hitting his second shot from the rough on the closing hole. The 2010 U.S. Open champion was unaware the ball had moved and he was penalised two strokes -- one for not replacing the ball into its original position and one for striking it from the wrong place. It turned his round of level par into a round of two-over. He told reporters: ""How are you supposed to attempt to place the ball when you're not sure it's moved in the first place? It's just a harsh one -- one of those freak scenarios in golf. ""It's my fault. I probably should have called for a referee. That would have saved me one shot, but what are you supposed to do -- the whole area was sort of bouncing. ""I was aware of it and asked for it to be looked at. The rules are there for everybody's protection."" Three-time major champion Ernie Els, from South Africa, is on four-under and compatriot Charl Schwartzel, the 2011 Masters champion, finished on three-under. Former world No. 1 Lee Westwood, who was beaten by Donald in a playoff at last year's tournament, birdied the last to finish two-under.","World No. 1 Rory McIlroy toils on the opening day of the BMW PGA Championship .

"(CNN) -- American golfer Webb Simpson made a furious charge Sunday to win the U.S. Open, grabbing his fist major tournament victory. Simpson had started the day four shots back off the lead but carded four birdies in five holes midway through the final round to get to the top of the leaderboard. It gave the U.S. a third successive major win following Bubba Watson's maiden triumph at the Masters in April and Keegan Bradley at last year's PGA Championship. Simpson shot two-under-par 68 Sunday to end the tournament at one-over 281 for the four rounds. That score was good enough to win as all the golfers struggled on the slick greens of San Francisco's Olympic Club and no one scored under par. ""It was a cool day. I had peace all day,"" said the 26-year-old Webb, who has won two other PGA Tour events. ""I prayed more the last three holes than I did all my life. ""I had no experience in major championships of contention at all, so for me to play Sunday fourth from the last group was probably an huge help, as opposed to the last group. I have gained utmost respect for all the guys who have won multiple majors, because it is just so hard to do. The level of pressure is so much greater than a regular event."" Former U.S. Open champions Jim Furyk and Graeme McDowell were tied for the lead coming into play Sunday. McDowell stumbled early in the final round but Furyk held the lead for most of day. Furyk, who had held the lead from Friday afternoon, was unable to withstand Simpson's great play. But still on the last hole, both McDowell and Furyk were just one shot behind Simpson. Both had to get birdies to catch Simpson and tie the tournament, setting up a dramatic ending. Furyk, the 2003 winner, buried his second shot in a bunker dashing his chances. McDowell -- who claimed his first major at Pebble Beach in 2010 -- played better but still missed a 24-foot birdie putt, to end his hopes. Tiger Woods continued his fall Sunday as he failed in his bid for his fourth U.S. Open title and his first major since winning at Torrey Pines in 2008. Woods was tied with Furyk and David Toms for the halfway lead going into play Saturday at one under par. But his play faded and on Sunday the 14-time major champion ended the tournament in a tie for 21st place, dropping four shots in the first three holes of his final round as he eventually signed for a 73. ""I was just a touch off, "" said Woods, who was six shots behind Simpson. ""Today, I got off to a horrific start and just never got it going. But there are a lot of positives that can be taken from this week.""","Webb Simpson had never won a major championship before Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A suicide attack in eastern Afghanistan killed 25 people Tuesday, the police chief in Nangarhar province said. Chief Abdullah Stanikzai said the attack happened during the funeral of a local elder in the Dor Baba district, near the border with Pakistan. Fifty people were injured in the incident, local officials reported. Among the wounded was the district chief of Dor Baba, Stanikzai said. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack, in a statement from his office. While it is not yet clear who was behind the blast, it is the latest of many to strike Afghan civilians. A recent United Nations report found that while violence against the Afghan population fell in the first half of the year, it is still taking a ""devastating toll on civilians."" About 80% of the attacks against civilians are by anti-government forces such as the Taliban, the report said. Nangarhar, which has Jalalabad as its capital and borders Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, has seen several recent International Security Assistance Force operations targeting militants. Afghan and coalition security forces arrested an alleged Taliban bomb-making expert in Nangarhar's Khugyani district earlier Tuesday, an ISAF statement said. The man ""is believed to be a leading figure in the movement and provision of explosives for attacks against coalition and Afghan security forces throughout eastern Nangarhar,"" the statement said. Several other suspected insurgents were seized in the same operation, as well as firearms, military uniforms and explosives, it said. A separate operation last week in Nangarhar's Hisarak district led to the arrest of an alleged Taliban insurgent accused of using his status as a member of the Afghan National Police to conduct an attack in May which killed two coalition service members in Helmand province, ISAF said. Prior to his capture, the man was attempting to join the Afghan National Army, ISAF said. U.S. forces take a leading role in ISAF operations in Nangarhar.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson pulled out this year's British Open Friday because his wife is due to give birth later this month. Simpson was set to fly in next week to the third major of the season at Royal Lytham and St Annes from July 19-22 but has decided against making the trip. A statement issued by tournament organizers said: ""Webb Simpson, the 2012 U.S. Open Champion, has withdrawn from The Open Championship due to family reasons."" A number of leading contenders have been tuning up for Lytham at this week's Scottish Open and there was a welcome return to form for four-time major champion Phil Mickelson. Mickelson holed his second shot for an eagle two at his opening hole at Castle Stuart and backed it up with six birdies for a second round eight-under 64. The American had opened with a disappointing 73 at the links course in Inverness but on seven-under 137 at halfway is handily placed for a weekend charge. ""There was big difference today compared to my 73 yesterday as I just hit a lot better shots, struck it solidly and made a few more putts,"" he told he official European Tour website. ""I have only played three tournaments the last couple of months so I knew I just needed to play more, and I'm glad I added this tournament."" Mickelson finished joint runner-up to Darren Clarke at last year's British Open and his last victory came at February's AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am where he finished with a 64. He trails joint leaders Alexander Noren of Sweden and Italian Francesco Molinari by five shots. Molinari had led after the opening round with a superb 62 but came back to the field with second round 70.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 10,000 troops and civilians have been deployed to Brazil's southern border region, in a show of force against illicit traffickers of all kinds who operate in the region, Brazil's defense ministry said. The deployment is the fifth such surge under a mission to reassert rule of law in the border area known as Operation Agatha. The most recent operation began on Monday and will continue through the end of the month, the defense ministry said. The Brazilian Air Force alone had more than 434 service members working directly in the operation. ""Our principal objective is to keep our air space from being used (for) illegal activities like drug trafficking and contraband,"" said Air Force mission commander Jose Geraldo Ferreira Malta. In total, 25 planes will participate in intelligence-gathering and protection of air space, the air force said. It is a three pronged strategy, Malta said, which includes direct confrontation with criminals, support to governmental bodies who work in the region, and support to the public in the form of health and cultural work. Forces are present in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and are conducting operations along Brazil's borders with Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. The targets are not just drug traffickers, however. According to the defense ministry, one of the targets is the sale of explosives to gangs that have robbed automatic teller machines. Troops have even been deployed to relatively peaceful areas. ""Our region, compared with other parts of the border, is more amenable. Here we have reports of minor crimes, like trafficking of pesticides and stealing of animals. Drug trafficking is minimal,"" said an army leader, Gen. Joarez Alves Pereira Junior in a statement. The Brazilian navy, army and air force are participating in the operation, along with police and civilian agencies.","Brazil sent nearly 10,000 troops and civilians to the southern border areas .
It is part of a mission to combat crime .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Four Chinese fishermen died and 12 were missing in stormy waters off South Korea's Jeju Island on Tuesday as Typhoon Bolaven brought howling winds and torrential rain to the Korean Peninsula. Maritime police on Jeju Island, situated off the southern tip of the South Korean mainland, said that 17 people had been rescued but that searches were on for those still unaccounted for after two boats capsized early Tuesday as Bolaven raged. The powerful storm was moving north alongside the west coast of South Korea by Tuesday afternoon, disrupting transport, cutting off power and damaging property. The South Korean Central Disaster Relief Headquarters said one person had died after being crushed by a container and that another had been injured after being hit by an object blown by the wind. Nearly 200,000 households were without power, the disaster agency said, most of them in the south of the country. About 1,000 people in coastal areas had been advised to relocate to safe areas, it said. The storm prompted the cancellation of 119 flights, the suspension of 96 ferry routes and the temporary closure of 21 roads, according to the agency. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea had called Monday on government agencies to take measures to minimize damage from the approaching storm, the national news agency Yonhap reported, citing Park Jeong-ha, a spokesman for Lee. Okinawa, meanwhile, emerged relatively unscathed Monday after the typhoon buffeted it with maximum sustained winds near its center of 185 kilometers per hour (115 mph), according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which monitors storms in the region. That wind strength put Bolaven in the ""super typhoon"" category at the time. And with a cloud field of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), it was 20 times larger than Okinawa's length. The storm weakened somewhat Tuesday to become a regular typhoon, with maximum sustained winds of around 130 kilometers per hour (86 miles per hour). Okinawa, which is situated in an area of the western Pacific Ocean where typhoons are frequent, avoided the kind of destruction that some other storms have caused in East Asia this summer. Five people were injured on the island, the local authorities said, and 549 residents took shelter in public buildings to avoid potential damage to their homes. About 17,500 households lost electricity as the storm damaged power lines. Storm chaser James Reynolds was on the northwestern coast of the island during the worst of the typhoon. ""Like the rest of the population we all just kind of holed up in the strong and sturdy buildings which make up Okinawa,"" he said Monday. The infrastructure on Okinawa is designed to withstand violent storms. ""Everything's made of solid concrete,"" Reynolds said. The damage was also limited because Bolaven didn't bring winds as powerful as initially feared, said Morichiyo Ohshiro, an official from the Okinawa Prefecture Disaster Prevention and Crisis Management Division. Isaac near hurricane strength; watch extends to Louisiana . The power of Bolaven was also having an effect on another storm further south. Typhoon Tembin made landfall in southern Taiwan a few days ago, and was expected to work its way toward Hong Kong. But Bolaven, which is much stronger, has stopped Tembin's movement toward Hong Kong and has been spinning it around. Time: Most destructive U.S. hurricanes .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities found an abandoned van containing 14 bodies along a highway in the central city San Luis Potosi Thursday. The victims -- all men -- appeared to have been kidnapped and killed, said Gabriela Gonzalez Chong, a spokeswoman for San Luis Potosi state prosecutors. Investigators believe the men were kidnapped in the northern border state of Coahuila, she told CNNMexico.com. ""Everything points to this being an incidence of organized crime,"" she said. 4 Mexican military officials accused of organized crime ties . Mexican authorities have blamed feuding cartels for similar killings in other parts of the country. But Thursday marked the first time authorities had found such a large number of bodies in San Luis Potosi, Gonzalez said. More than 47,500 people have died in drug-related violence in Mexico since December 2006, when Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced plans to deploy troops in efforts to combat cartels. According to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission, more than 5,300 people have disappeared throughout the country in that same time period, and the bodies of 9,000 dead have not been identified. Officials fear the total number of missing could be far higher, because many disappearances go unreported. Violence surged in some parts of San Luis Potosi in 2010, as turf battles increased between Mexico's Gulf cartel and the Zetas. The Zetas started with deserters from Mexican special forces, who quickly gained a reputation for ruthless violence as hired assassins for the Gulf cartel. The partnership between the two criminal groups ended in 2010. Report: Mexico should focus on cops, not army . Feds uncover drug tunnel from Mexico to Arizona .

"(CNN) -- A large, hanging and then collapsing chunk of ice is likely the reason why two American climbers died in Peru, an investigator said Monday. The bodies of Ben Horne and Gil Weiss were found two days earlier, a heartbreaking end to a high-tech search. The men disappeared while attempting to scale the south face of Palcaraju Oeste, a 6,110-meter (20,000-foot) tall mountain located in Huaraz, a region popular with climbers. Ted Alexander, who coordinated an investigation and effort to find the men, said Horne and Weiss made it to the summit and ran into trouble on their way down. Evidence suggests that one of the men likely went to look over a serac -- a large block of ice -- to see if they could descend. Something gave out, causing the climber to fall some 65 feet, said Alexander. But because the men would have been tethered together, that first fall likely pulled the other man off the edge, which sent them both spiraling off a large cliff. ""Their equipment was strewn over the glacier. There was sign of great impact. (It) would lead us to believe that they did fall. My guess, looking at the photos and from talking to our guys out there that it was probably about a 1,000-foot fall,"" Alexander said. Weiss, 29, was the founder of Beyond Adventure, a company consisting of professional guides, logistical experts and photographers. He posted June 11 on his Facebook page that he was leaving Boulder, Colorado, for Peru ""for another season in the High Andes."" On July 10, Horne, 32, posted pictures and a chronicle of experiences in Peru on the climbing blog Pullharder.org. ""The Cordillera Blanca is world renowned for its high altitude mountaineering,"" he wrote. ""But almost as awesome as the mountains themselves is the motley crew of international climbers who come to try their hand at getting high, on big peaks, cheap and fast."" Shay Har-Noy, who heads the technology company Tomnod that uses satellite imagery, said he enlisted the help of climbers and technology experts to find the pair using an application he built, with hundreds of people at one point poring through satellite images looking for signs of an avalanche. That information was then sent to search and rescue crews on the ground in Peru. Horne and Weiss were extremely fit and experienced climbers, having practiced the sport for more than a decade, according to Har-Noy. Weiss had been to Peru several times before, though this was Horne's first such visit. ""Gil had the most optimistic view on practically everything,"" Gil's sister Galit Weiss told CNN. ""I think it's really important to understand that you have to make the most of what you've got, and you've got to be grateful for everyone in your life."" 9 dead in French avalanche, police say .

"(CNN) -- Niagara Regional Police asked Friday for the public's help in identifying the woman whose dismembered body was found in the Canadian portion of the Niagara River. The torso, which had no head or limbs, was spotted by citizens Wednesday and recovered near the Rainbow Bridge near Niagara Falls. ""It's important to identify this person to bring closure to family members and to hold those responsible accountable for this crime,"" Inspector Jim McCaffery told reporters. He gave details he hoped would help jog someone's memory. The victim was a white woman, likely in her mid-20s to early 40s, said McCaffery. She had at least one cesarean section, her fallopian tubes were tied and her navel was pierced. The woman was the victim of a homicide, the inspector said. The body probably was in the water between four and 10 days. The cause of death has not been released. Niagara police are working with area police jurisdictions to identify any women who may be missing. So far, they are looking at about 20 cases, said McCaffery. Authorities have said the homicide was unrelated to another case where the body parts of a woman named Guang Hua Liu were found in several places.

"(CNN) -- The Mexican and Belizean governments issued hurricane warnings Monday for the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as Tropical Storm Ernesto churned toward the area. The storm is expected to become a hurricane by Monday night. In Nicaragua, government officials said they were evacuating about 1,500 people in coastal areas and had banned boats from setting sail. As of Monday afternoon, the storm was about 160 miles (260 kilometers) east of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border, the National Hurricane Center reported. Ernesto was moving west-nothwest at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. The storm was expected to pass to the south of the Cayman Islands and near the northern coast of Honduras on Monday night. Belize also issued a hurricane warning for its east coast. Areas of the Cayman Islands, Honduras and the Yucatan Peninsula are under tropical storm warnings. Meanwhile, Florence weakened to a post-tropical system. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect for that storm, which was about 1,515 miles (2,440 kilometers) east of the northern Leeward Islands late Monday morning, the hurricane center said. It was moving west at about 15 mph. Maximum sustained winds dipped to 35 mph, and further weakening is forecast in the coming days. NASA scientist links climate change, extreme weather .

"(EW.com) -- Fox has nabbed NBC's spinning chairs! After ""The Voice"" swiped some of ""American Idol's"" ratings thunder this season, Fox is now returning the favor, launching a new show called ... ""The Choice."" In an announcement that seems like a brilliant April Fools' Joke (but, we're assured, is not), Fox's new summer series will feature -- like ""The Voice"" -- contestants in blind auditions for a quartet of celebrity judges who are seated in spinning chairs. The big difference: Instead of a music competition, this is a dating show. So, yes, famous faces will audition their potential love interests, making a contestant's hidden physical appearance potentially quite relevant to the celebrity in the power seat. Fox is not ready to announce the participating celebrities, but we can reveal the show's host will be Cat Deeley, pulling double duty while hosting ""So You Think You Can Dance"" this summer. ""The Choice"" is from longtime Fox alternative series president Mike Darnell and producers A. Smith & Co, who presumably didn't get this idea while watching ""Survivor."" ""I think there's a big hole in the dating show world,"" says Darnell, who is also launching the U.K. dating show import ""Take Me Out"" this summer. ""There hasn't been a new hit since 'The Bachelor,' and there hasn't been an in-studio one that's worked since 'The Dating Game' 30 years ago. I was thinking about how to do a blind-date show without using a wall or blindfolds, and the spinning chairs seemed like a great way to do it."" 'Best Friends Forever': A salute . Of course, ""The Choice"" has more in common with ""The Voice"" than just chairs -- like that title, for instance? "" 'The Choice' seems like an obvious title because you have to make a choice,"" Darnell says, then playfully adds: ""I'm just now realizing it rhymes!"" Fox plans to air six one-hour episodes this summer, debuting the show on Thursday, June 7 at 9 p.m. Five of the episodes will have male celebrities with female contestants; one will have female celebrities and male contestants. All the singles will be physically attractive (I know, you expected Fox to stock the pond with some wicked surprises, right?). 'Celeb Apprentice' peek: Aubrey topless . In the first round, celebrities will listen to ""sexy singles"" describe themselves. If the celebrity bachelor likes what he hears, instead of a big red button the star will pull his ""love handle,"" spinning his chair around to bring him face-to-face with his potential mate. If more than one celebrity pulls their handle, they battle for her affection until the contestant decides who they prefer to date. Once each bachelor has his three prospective dates, the teams enter the ""Speed Choice"" round, where each woman has seconds to convince the man to select her for the final round. Then Deeley will pose a challenge question to the final two contestants. The winners get to go on one date with their celebrity.

"Editor's note: This article contains possible spoilers for the Olympic opening ceremony. (EW.com) -- The opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympic Games has been shrouded in mystery, with director Danny Boyle keen to keep any details of the $42 million spectacle under wraps. However despite acknowledging that the Internet and social media make it too tempting for people to keep a secret and that spoilers are now part of ""the modern world,"" Boyle graciously invited 60,000 fans to witness a rehearsal of the ceremony at the Olympic Stadium in London, days before the actual event, asking them to not tweet photos and suggesting the hashtag #savethesurprise. Despite many of the clearly wowed audience sticking to the director's wishes, details have since emerged, so what exactly do we know? Or what do we think we know? Way back in April it was rumored that Daniel Craig had filmed a segment as James Bond at Buckingham Palace with Boyle. This segment purportedly ends with Bond parachuting into the Olympic Stadium and kicking things off in style. We're betting the parachute bear a Union Jack, echoing the opening of ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" OLYMPICS 2012: Get the latest news, photos, and more . The theme of the entire event is 'Isles of Wonder' and rumors of cottages, green fields with cricket matches and free roaming sheep present a chocolate-box ideal of the U.K., something more akin to the Shire. With Boyle at the helm, director of ""Trainspotting,"" ""28 Days Later,"" ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" and the recent stage adaption of ""Frankenstein,"" we can't expect the events to be all sweetness and light. Aerial photographs have shown dark smoke stacks and The Huffington Post reports ""There will be vignettes drawing on British history -- Boyle's people-power version of it -- including Depression-era jobless protesters and nurses performing a tribute to the National Health Service."" One part of the stadium is even set up to look like the Empire Windrush -- a ship that brought migrants from the Caribbean to the U.K. in the 1940s. Perhaps the most intriguing prediction comes from British newspaper The Sunday Times. Bordering on the so-crazy-it-just-might-work, the paper reports that a 40-foot Voldemort is set to do battle with an army of Mary Poppins'. Yes, you read that correctly. After a dance routine where approximately 100 kids dance on hospital beds, and representations of famous children's book characters join them, Voldemort pops out of a giant bed, surrounded by flying Dementors terrorizing the youngsters. This is where the 30 or so Mary Poppins' will float into the stadium to do battle with He Who Must Not Be Named. The final act will feature a host of musicians, culminating in a performance of 'Hey Jude' by none other than He Who Must Not Be Silenced, Paul McCartney. See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Jamie Donaldson claimed the first European Tour title of his career with a resounding four-stroke victory at the Irish Open on Sunday. The Welshman made sure of his first win in 255 attempts with a closing six-under par round of 66 at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland -- the first time the event has taken place north of the border since 1953. ""I guess it takes some people longer than others, and it's taken me a lot longer than I thought to win,"" Donaldson said. ""The first three years went too quickly and then I was out for a year with injury, so I didn't find my feet too soon after that, and then I lost my way a bit. But over the last two to three years I feel as though I have been building to this win and it's just so nice to be finally holding this trophy,"" he added. The 36-year-old started his final round trailing Sweden's Mikael Lundberg who set off at a blistering pace going out in 29 strokes. But Donaldson immediately set about reclaiming his overnight lead, bagging three birdies in the opening four holes to set the tone for the rest of an assured final round. A bogey four at the par three 11th hole was followed by birdies at the 12th, 14th and 15th holes. Another bogey at the 16th failed to unnerve Donaldson who closed out like a champion birdieing the closing two holes to finish the week on 18-under par. Donaldson, who pocketed a winner's check of â‚¬333,330, finished four shots clear of England's Anthony Wall, Rafa Cabrera-Bello from Spain and Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti in second. Wall, who was paired with Donaldson during Sunday's round, paid tribute to the Welshman afterwards. ""I've never doubted him. He's a class act and a super, super player, and he deserves everything he gets because he does work hard and he's got loads of talent,"" Wall said, EuropeanTour.com reported. Hopes of an Irish winner faded on Sunday when Padraig Harrington could only manage a closing round of 70 to finish six shots adrift of Donaldson in tie for seventh place with Scotland's Craig Lee (68) and David Drysdale (66). Rory McIlroy had too much ground to make up on the final day but finished with a bogey-free round of 67 to claim a share of 10th place on 11-under par.","Welshman claims maiden European Tour win at 255th attempt at Irish Open on Sunday .

"(EW.com) -- Seven seasons into judging ""America's Best Dance Crew,"" JC Chasez likes to ""go into it fresh every week."" It's easier said than done with dozens of dance crews floating around in the former NSYNC member's head at any given time. Tonight's performances of Drake songs will likely go a long way toward a little mental spring cleaning, though. After routines to Britney, Madonna, and Flo Rida tracks, . ""Drake is a great change-up,"" said Chasez. ""The Flo Rida music is very high-paced and energetic, and you're dealing with two female icons who do dance music. Drake's tempo is totally different musically. That's what I'm looking forward to. It's going to be really, really interesting to see how these crews adjust."" Below, Chasez talks about the latest crop of ""ABDC"" competitors, teases upcoming superstars, names some of his favorite routines in the show's history, dishes on ""The Voice"" and the current boy band resurgence, and addresses rumors of an NSYNC reunion. ""It's a really tight race [on 'ABDC'] this year,"" Chasez admitted. He's been most surprised by the Elektrolytes. ""On my first viewing... I thought they were really good, but I didn't know if they possessed what it took to go all the way,"" he said, ""but last week's performance really opened up my eyes."" He also named Mos Wanted and 8 Flavahz as two early standouts this season but says any of the crews ""could all go all the way if they keep improving."" For sure, the competitors will need to keep upping the ante with the line-up of superstars to come, including LMFAO, Jennifer Lopez, and David Guetta, to name a few. Chasez is especially excited for the Guetta set because . ""DJs are so prominent now in music."" He added, ""It might be fun if there's another season in front of us to do an entire week about DJs. Their music has really jumped into the forefront, and dancers react to that stuff really well."" Outside of ""ABDC,"" Chasez admitted that he's keeping an eye on another reality show: ""The Voice."" He's rooting for former fellow Mousketeer and long-time friend Tony Lucca. ""There's no denying that I would love to see him win,"" said Chasez. ""His voice has life in it. He's lived. There are certain performers who sound great, but don't have that. He's been through so much that you can hear those things in his tone and with his delivery, and that's what makes him special."" Chasez is also keeping up with the current boy band revival. As someone who lived through the height of ""TRL,"" he is ""really proud"" of these guys' success. ""I love that One Direction is giving young people something to get excited about,"" he said. ""Look, a 10-year-old's not going to relate to Eminem, so there needs to be somebody out there that can speak to somebody young to show them a good time."" And he definitely digs The Wanted's ""Glad You Came."" ""I don't think anybody first heard that song and said, 'That's got to be a boy band,'"" he noted. ""There's room for everybody as long as it's quality."" Unfortunately, there's no room for an NSYNC reunion right now. Despite the returns of NKOTBSB and 98 Degrees in the last year, Chasez said emphatically, ""The answer's still no. If you're going to do something, it has to be for all the right reasons -- and that's not money or the fact that everybody else is doing it. We're happy with what it was and the way we finished things. We did what we set out to do and we're comfortable with that."" Of course, Chasez had to pay respect the crew that took the title in season 1: ""The Jabbawockeez were amazing. Their imagery still stands out through 7 seasons. They're unforgettable."" He also gave credit to season 2â€²s Super Cr3w, ""really elevated the B-boy thing and brought that to the forefront in the United States."" A few more standouts: . Quest Crew: ""OrQUESTra"" ""The Quest Crew combined all the elements of season 1 and 2,"" said Chasez. ""The piano routine that propelled them into the finale was very memorable."" BluePrint Cru: ""Bad Romance"" This season 5 piece stood out, too, but Chasez admitted it was a tough call.

"(CNN) -- Sweden's Carl Pettersson and Tiger Woods were neck and neck as the second round of the U.S. PGA Championship at Kiawah Island, South Carolina drew to a close on Friday. Pettersson, who posted a six-under par round of 66 on Thursday, made a shaky start to his second round collecting two bogeys in the opening three holes, before hitting back with three birdies. But further bogeys in the closing holes checked his progress once again allowing the more consistent Woods to edge closer to the top of the leaderboard. Earlier, Fiji's Vijay Singh posted a round of 69 to finish on four-under par leaving leave him well placed to mount a challenge at the weekend. England's Ian Poulter was also four under with a handful of holes to complete. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy finished the day two-under for the tournament after shooting a disappointing three-over par round of 75. Adam Scott is one shot further back after posting the same score, while Phil Mickelson is on even-par after firing a one-under par round 71. John Daly slipped down the leaderboard into a tie for 16th on Friday. The 1991 champion finished with a five-over 77, one place ahead of 2008 champion Padraig Harrington who struggled to a 76. Luke Donald's quest for a first major looks like it will have to wait until 2013 after a second round 76 left him on six-over par and in danger of missing the cut.

"(EW.com) -- Last week, EW was on the scene for the reunion taping of ""RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited,"" which will air this evening at 9 p.m. on Logo. (Of course, you'll also be able to stream coverage of the show's big coronation party in NYC -- there will be interviews with all this season's queens -- on LogoTV.com, from 8 to 10:15 p.m. ET tonight, too.) Based on what happened at last week's taping, the episode that airs tonight should be a doozy of an hour that will delve into the drama around Willam's surprising early exit from the season; award one queen the Miss Congeniality award (you might be able to guess who, but I'm not telling you...); and, of course, finally crown Chad Michaels, Sharon Needles, or Phi Phi O'Hara as America's Next Drag Superstar. No one knows who will take home the glory except for one person: host and show namesake RuPaul. Which is why we here at EW enlisted the drag legend for a quick chat last Friday afternoon to discuss all things about tonight's ""Reunited"" special and season 4. Read on for Ru's thoughts on the controversial decision to tape three endings to tonight's episode; why season 4 was stands out from the previous three; the appeal of fallen queen Latrice Royale; what's going on with ""All Stars: RuPaul's Drag Race""; and much, much more. EW: I was at the reunion, which was oodles of fun. But walk me through your decision to tape it the way you did. Why shoot the three endings? RuPaul: I was so p***ed off that people had leaked it last year. I thought, how awful that they wouldn't consider everyone else's enjoyment, but you have to understand that the human ego will do whatever it takes to get attention because it needs to know that it exists. So, people leaked that Raja was the winner last year, without thinking about other people's enjoyment. I was so mad, so one morning, I woke up and between the time of getting out of bed and still kind of in a dream, it occurred to me that if we shot three endings? Then no one would know. Of course, we had to do it in front of a live audience because the show has grown so much and there's so much excitement. Why not turn it into a super-huge event? And you know, the taping was like the Academy Awards for drag. It was! EW: The staging was beautiful, everyone looked great. You elevated it to the next level. Was that the goal? RuPaul: We had to because this show was so near and dear to so many people's hearts, and we're really changing the level that people come to expect from drag. During the Bush era, drag really had been the step child of the gay right's movement, even though we were the ones who got things rocking at Stonewall. So, I love drag, I love the art of drag, I love people who have the chutzpah to really get down and do drag because it takes a lot of balls to do drag and it takes a lot of courage for someone to get out there and say, ""You know what? I know what society expects of me, but you know what? F*** you, I'm going to do it anyway."" EW: Were you happy with the way the reunion turned out? Did it come off as you had envisioned it? RuPaul: Oh my God, it was so much more. I had so much fun doing it. It was so exciting. I was actually high from it the whole next day. The whole next day! And strangely, it came off without a hitch. We started a little bit late, but it went without a hitch. It was kind of scary. I had to ask them, ""Are you guys sure you put film in the camera?"" Because everything went so smoothly. EW: Did you have a favorite moment from the reunion? RuPaul: Yes, my favorite part of the night was when I came out and I said to the audience, ""We have Drag Race royalty here. Hey Pork Chop!"" [Laughs.] . EW: That was indeed a moment. Why did you love that so much? RuPaul: We have changed the star system. We have created a new star system, where Pork Chop -- who, in the history of our show, was the first queen eliminated -- is sitting front row, center, and is acknowledged for the grand dame legend that she is. In the other star system of Hollywood, you know, you're here today and gone tomorrow. But not so with our show, and we're creating a while new vernacular and a whole new star system. EW: Well, it's almost like you've created a ""Drag Race"" family -- which is so cool, in my opinion. RuPaul: It is cool, especially in what's thought of as a disenfranchised subculture of a subculture. EW: Do you ever think about how insanely buzzy this show is compared to other shows that are maybe 10 or 15 times bigger, in terms of audience? RuPaul: You know, I didn't think it would get to this point. I knew that there were people who absolutely loved drag and drag is their life, and I knew that there were people who understood drag. There are so many other layers to it, just by the nature of the beast. But I didn't know it would become such a cult hit, and sometimes it is disappointing because, yeah, there are shows that get 15 million viewers and our biggest audience is sometimes 1.5 million, maybe. But honestly, I'd rather have that 1.5 million of devoted fans, who live and breathe this show, than the other. I'm happy at Logo. They let us do so much. They give us free reign, and I couldn't ask for anything more. EW: When you think about season 4, compared to the three that came before it, how does it fit in -- or differ -- from those? RuPaul: I think the characters are stronger. I think it's more character-driven. Before, we had a lot of pretty, pretty girls. You know, there were some pretty girls this season, but that wasn't the main focus. The main focus was difference and character, and that's why I think people are so passionate about this season. The bottom line is that people want to see themselves, they wanna see passion, and they wanna see characters. I think that's why this is our biggest season ever. EW: So, Chad Michaels, Phi Phi O'Hara, or Sharon Needles will win the crown on Monday evening. Why does each one, separately, deserve to win that crown? RuPaul: I think what really describes them, each, is perseverance. And that's really what our show is about. Our show, at its core, is about the tenacity of the human spirit, and all three of them exemplify that to the umpteenth degree. I think, honestly, that's why people are so passionate about the show. These girls represent the courage that they feel they have, or the courage that lies in potential in every human being. In terms of representing our show, all three are strong characters, they have a strong story is easy to root for, and that's why people love them so much. Whichever one wins the crown will be a great representative. EW: Let's talk about Latrice Royale real quick. But what is her appeal? RuPaul: She is that earth mother. She is that one who is not catty and who you can trust. She is very trustworthy. How honest she was about her own story and how forthcoming she was with her story, it made everyone feel very comfortable. She's a genuine person and so wise. I think that is why people love her so much. Plus, she's an amazing performer. Amazing! EW: How much did fan lobbying have to do with the decision for this year's crown? Did you really let fans influence you? RuPaul: Well, you know, it does influence to a certain degree, but obviously, ultimately, the decision is mine. [Laughs.] . EW: So that decision -- let's talk about it. It's Friday afternoon right now, the Friday before the Monday airing of the reunion finale. Have you made it yet? RuPaul: Yeah, I've made it. It's made. EW: On Monday, where will you be when the episode is airing? RuPaul: I have threatened to go to some of the clubs here in Los Angeles. Well, no, the club owners don't know yet, but I may, I may go to the Eagle and then go to Micky's. And then probably MJs, too. One of the other ""Drag Race"" producers suggested that we do a drive-by at all these clubs. EW: So ""All Stars: RuPaul's Drag Race."" I'm obsessed with it. What can you say about it at this person? RuPaul: Well, I know fans are going to be excited about it either way. I can't tell you much about ""All Stars"" right now, but I tell you that it's going to be the favorites, it's going to be the favorites from all seasons. A girl for all seasons! A drag for all seasons! We basically wait a year for each series, so this'll be in the interim. ""Drag U"" and then ""All Stars"" and then ""Drag Race"" season 5. EW: With ""All Stars,"" regular ""Drag Race,"" and ""Drag U,"" you're taking over Logo. Will there be a day where something from the ""Drag Race"" universe is on Logo every week? RuPaul: [Laughs.] You know, we should have our own sub-channel called The Drag Channel. Sure, why not! See the full article at EW.com.

"(EW.com) -- The success of any tightly scripted, live event is certainly measured in ratings, ticket sales, buzz, and -- with regard to quadrennial political nominating conventions -- voting returns. But the real yardstick for any major pop-culture event comes down to one simple element: The surprise celebrity cameo. Recent examples include James Bond and Queen Elizabeth skydiving into the London Olympics Opening Ceremonies; Tupac Shakur's hologram at Coachella; and when Jon Hamm popped up to say goodbye to Kristen Wiig on ""SNL."" Hoping to add itself to that storied list, apparently, is the 2012 Republican National Convention. The latest RNC schedule, released on Monday, notes that before presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney is introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, the convention will hear remarks from someone -- or something -- ""To Be Announced."" That tantalizing clue led FoxNews.com today to report via a single unnamed source that actor, filmmaker, and all-around American icon Clint Eastwood is indeed the surprise guest. Unless it's football player Tim Tebow. Or former president George H.W. Bush arriving via parachute (the 85-year-old is quite the skydiver). Or, as one aide maybe joked in the story, ""a Ronald Reagan hologram."" These are all choices with serious potential to stir up some major buzz -- if the remarks weren't preceding the biggest speech of Mitt Romney's political career. That's the trick of a surprise guest: You want people to be impressed, but you don't want to overshadow the main event. Would Romney look cooler drafting off of Eastwood or Tebow? Or by comparison would he seem more like a businessman android than some already claim he is? See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- ""The Borgias"" are back for a second season and according to star Jeremy Irons we can expect even more nefarious plotting and lustful encounters. The 63-year-old actor has had a long career including an Academy Award for ""Reversal of Fortune"" and voicing the malevolent Scar in ""The Lion King."" He recently spoke to CNN about playing a pope and his not-so-secret vice. CNN: What can we expect this season? Jeremy Irons: You can expect a good ride, a naughty ride, a good ride. I think you can expect an even more exciting ride than last season. It's perkier; it's faster with a lot of surprises. CNN: When you first signed up, were you worried that it would be historical soft porn? Irons: No, because I know Showtime, I know Neil Jordan. I thought that we'd avoid that and I think we have. CNN: The show is like ""The Sopranos"" in the Vatican. Irons: I would say that's right. CNN: The characters are pretty venal. Irons: Yes life was more on the edge. Life was not valued quite as highly as it is today. People were used to fighting, people were used to dying. Death was much more a part of life than it is today. Children and women would die in childbirth. Men would die. The whole perception was different. CNN: You play a pope who has children. Would you be surprised if it was discovered that Pope Benedict has kids? Irons: Um, not particularly (laughs). CNN: Your voice is like catnip to the ladies. Irons: I don't think about it. You use what you've got! Before I was married I didn't sound like this because I didn't smoke so much. CNN: So smoking is good for actors? Irons: Well in truth, to be serious, I suppose it's not particularly good, but it does give me huge pleasure and allows me time for reflection. If I did yoga perhaps I wouldn't have to, but I don't. I go outside and have a smoke and I find those gaps in the hurly burly of the film world very useful. CNN: Is the cigarette accompanied by a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit? Irons: Often (speaking with a full mouth). There's a chocolate biscuit in my mouth at the moment and a cup of tea but no cigarette. But there will be one in a minute. CNN: Your son Max (""Red Riding Hood"") is gorgeous! Irons: That's very nice. He takes after his mother. CNN: I have little kids. I think I've seen ""The Lion King"" 30 times. Irons: There's something wrong with you. CNN: Do you get people coming up to you with your kids? Irons: I do and the kids sort of look at me so embarrassed. Scar is a lion on the screen for them. They stand there looking long suffering while their parents make me write them an autograph. CNN: What's your favorite movie? Irons: It's strange because it's always the experience of making it that's the great thing. Making ""The Mission"" was fantastic, making ""Dead Ringers"" was a great experience, making ""Lolita"" was a great experience. Making ""The Borgias"" is a great experience. We have a lot of fun, great crew, great cast, shooting in a fantastic city, Budapest. I get up and I'm really pleased to work and that's what I'll remember. In a way, it never has much actually to do with what the movie's like. CNN: Budapest is a beautiful city. Irons: I like the youth of the city and it has a slightly crumbly nature about it because they haven't quite got the money to finish everything off.","Jeremy Irons plays Rodrigo Borgia, a Pope, in ""The Borgias""

"(CNN) -- Life is good for actor Brenton Thwaites. When his new movie, ""Blue Lagoon: The Awakening"" hits the small screen Saturday, he'll have to watch it from across the pond. Thwaites is in London filming his next project, ""Maleficent,"" opposite Angelina Jolie. Being introduced to the world audience as a romantic lead in back-to-back projects will undoubtedly bring attention to the 22-year-old Aussie with the quick wit and penchant for dropping F-bombs. It's an interesting mix for a guy who is shy and has no desire to be a heartthrob. Thwaites recently talked to CNN's JD Cargill about his career, his aversion to fame and why he'd like some quality time with John McEnroe. JD Cargill: What's your emotional state like right now? Brenton Thwaites: My emotional state is pure f*****g numbness. It's great, I'm living my dream! Cargill: Tell me a little bit about this latest remake of ""Blue Lagoon."" What sort of trouble are you kids getting into in that water? Thwaites: It's a modern film, you know. It's not nearly as hectic as the last one. There's a lot more controversy and a lot more misty activity in the last one. This one's about two high school kids who go on a humanitarian trip to Trinidad. They get caught in a storm and get stranded on an island. It's their journey surviving on the island. But as the journey goes on, they fall in love. Cargill: Based on what I've seen, the costuming department had it easy on this one. Thwaites: Well, kind of, yeah. We're both wearing big jackets and beanies and whatever, and then we get thrown into this humid, tropical climate. As one would do if one was in love with a girl and on an island -- I mean, I'd wear nothing, personally. Unfortunately, Lifetime can't show my big. ... Cargill: OK, let's leave it at that. But speaking of lifetime, they are all about television for women. Are you prepared after this film to be a heartthrob and mobbed by women at every turn? Thwaites: No way, I'm going to punch them all out! No, it's very flattering and it's great and it's part of the industry and it's part of my job, but I'm very shy. I haven't had the whole ""famous"" thing happen to me yet, and I hope I never will. I like to sneak away in the corners and hide a lot. Cargill: Here's my one dumb question: If you could be stranded on a desert island with anyone dead or alive, who would it be? Thwaites: I like this question! I'm going to have to ponder it for at least 20 seconds. You know what? It would be John McEnroe because I believe we could make tennis rackets out of the palm trees and play tennis with the coconuts. And he would get so angry, and it would be so entertaining up close. I'd be entertained the whole time. Who else? It'd have to be an attractive girl. My ex-girlfriend. She would be nice to put in there. That would be a nice trio. Cargill: I noticed you didn't mention Angelina Jolie. Did you like that transition? Thwaites: Very nice. Cargill: You're now shooting the new ""Sleeping Beauty"" movie, ""Maleficent"" with her. Thwaites: People want to know all this stuff about Angelina Jolie. She's a massive star in this film and she's such an amazing actress and a great figure in this industry. But my experience with her and all the other stars in the film is quite normal. We rock out and we rehearse and we talk about the scene and we talk about the characters. Everyone kind of voices their opinion and talks to the director and it's just like any other film. There's no stardom. All that stuff is left at the front door. We're all kind of working together to create this cool film. Cargill: It might feel normal now, but I can imagine you beat out some pretty famous names to play the prince. Thwaites: You know, I actually don't know who auditioned for it, and I'd like to keep it that way. It's weird when auditioning for roles, because a lot of my mates go out for the same roles. You don't want to know that you're beating someone to the role. I think that's the wrong attitude to have in this town. No one's better, just different. They were looking for someone who was exactly like me.","Lifetime has re-spun a 1980s tale with ""Blue Lagoon: The Awakening""

"(EW.com) -- NBC has finally found someone to play the wife of Herman Munster in NBC's reboot of the classic black and white comedy ""The Munsters."" And the lucky gal is... Portia de Rossi! De Rossi joins the previously cast Jerry O'Connell (""The Defenders"") as the matriarch and patriarch of Mockingbird Lane, the name of Bryan Fuller's dramatic re-imagining of the old show that starred Fred Gywnne as Herman and Yvonne De Carlo as Lily. The pilot is in development for a possible midseason berth on NBC. Why the title change? Here's what Fuller told EW: ""The script is such a dramatic departure from the tone and style of the original show. If we continued to call the show 'The Munsters,' people are just going to to think we're doing 'The Munsters.' We're doing a reinvention and re-imagination of this property. I love the Universal monsters. I love The Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Invisible Man, The Wolfman, Phantom of the Opera, The Mummy. There's so many great characters we can run through this metaphor of family storytelling that it just felt it was ripe to do as a one-hour dramedy. Having all those elements to play with, the toy box is really, really full."" ""Mockingbird Lane"" was originally developed for fall, but casting the show turned out to be a lot harder than Fuller and NBC had planned. The primary issue was finding the right cast. ""I tend to write in a very tricky tone,"" Fuller told EW. ""It's hard to find actors who are agile enough to navigate the turns. There's mouthfuls of dialog. Fortunately, we went to Eddie Izzard as Grandpa very early in the process. He's a great piece of casting for us.""

"(EW.com) -- After stabbing, slashing and pummeling countless enemies, Spartacus will slay his final Roman next year. Starz is set to announce that the next season of its historical drama ""Spartacus"" will mark the show's final outing. The upside: Creator Steven S. DeKnight promises the remaining episodes will be spectacular (see the final season poster and teaser video here). ""This season is bigger than anything we've attempted,"" DeKnight says. ""The scope and scale is just amazing. We're dealing with massive battles between thousands of people. We hope to leave people feel satisfied."" DeKnight says he's been 90 percent certain for months that the upcoming third season -- subtitled ""War of the Damned"" -- would be the last for ""Spartacus."" Creatively, the writer-producer assures that the timing will result in a strong tale. The historical foundation for the rebel leader's journey, he says, lends itself to wrapping up the show sooner rather than later. ""Looking at the story in the history books, it's wave after wave of Roman senators going after Spartacus who are defeated until [Roman general Marcus Crassus] comes in,"" DeKnight says. ""There's only so many battles you can put a spin on. So let's pick out the most interesting moments in this struggle and lay out a clear narrative for Spartacus and his rebellion. I wanted to lay out a strong forward narrative with a strong antagonist."" ""Spartacus"" may wrap sooner than many fans might like, yet the historical drama actually survived longer than most expected. The show has had a wild and difficult run since it launched on Starz two years ago. The first season was a phenomenon. Its violent comic-book imagery may have been inspired by the hit film ""300,"" but ""Spartacus'"" operatic computer-assisted visual style and profanely quotable Shakespean-esque dialogue quickly established the show as singularly unique. Ratings started modest, then climbed with nearly every episode, eventually hitting about 6 million viewers when including all encore airings and viewing platforms. Tragedy struck after the first season when the show's breakout star Andy Whitfield was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Pre-production on season two was halted. A short-order prequel sans Whitfield, ""Gods of the Arena,"" kept the show functioning while producers and the network hoped for the actor's recovery. Eventually, the role of Spartacus was turned over to newcomer Liam McIntyre, who led the show's recent second season. ""This show has always been a challenge,"" DeKnight says. ""We've faced some unique challenges and tragedies. I'm particularly thankful to Starz. Any other network, if the show's lead actor had fallen ill and eventually passed away, they would have canceled the show. Starz felt like we owed it to the audience and to Andy to finish the tale."" In the most recent season, Spartacus led his rebel band of slaves to victory against the Romans at Mt. Vesuvius and defeated his longtime nemesis Gaius Claudius Glaber. As first reported on EW.com, the new season adds Todd Lasance as an ambitious young Julius Caesar and Simon Merrells as Crassus. DeKnight says Crassus will introduce a truly formidable enemy to help drive next year's drama. ""Crassus is kind of like the Roman boogieman we've been talking about for the last three seasons,"" he says. ""We meet him in episode one and you totally get that this is a guy who â€” maybe he can't equal Spartacus in a one-on-one fight, but he's just as shrewd and smart and dangerous as Spartacus."" Spartacus will leave behind a legacy of having stretched the boundaries of series television, between expanding the use of green-screen technology (the show has never shot one frame outdoors) and proving hard-R sex and violence can draw an audience when mixed with compelling storytelling. There was, and remains, nothing quite like the show on TV. ""I would much rather end a series with the audience wanting more than limping to the finish line, with only the die-hard fans sticking around for the wrap up,"" DeKnight says. ""We want to make the 10 best episodes we can. I can't wait for everybody to see it."" Update: DeKnight says he has a new show in development at Starz that could be the successor to Spartacus. We're hearing the mysterious project's working title is Incursion. The series is described in industry circles as a ""Halo-like video game meets HBO's Band of Brothers."" The writer-producer says the show isn't expected to be another fully immersed green-screen production like Spartacus. Starz says the project is still in very early stages, but obviously we're looking forward to whatever DeKnight makes next. See the full story at EW.com.

"(EW.com) -- Three Thursday night dramas were greeted with larger audiences for their final episodes of the season, but one NBC comedy tied its all-time low. ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy"" delivered 11.1 million viewers and a 3.9 rating, up 11 percent from last week and marking its best rating in three months. Check out EW.com's interview with ""Grey's"" showrunner Shonda Rhimes about last night's two shocking exits here. Bigger news: Rhimes' ""Scandal"" (7.5 million, 2.4) was up too, and not just a little. The political soap was up 26 percent, which is expected to mark a series high for the show (even after its rating is adjusted later today to account for some ""Grey's"" overrun). ""Scandal"" started its brief midseason run modestly but, as we've noted before, seemed like it had the potential to grow. CBS' ""The Mentalist"" (13 million, 2.5) was also up a tick for its latest Red John-focused finale (our interview with creator Bruno Heller about the finale here). Lead-in ""Person of Interest"" (13.3 million, 2.5), however, was down a notch for its finale. All four dramas return this fall, though ""The Mentalist"" will shift to Sunday nights. Now, about that triple-header ""Community"" finale. Why is NBC moving this comedy to Friday nights? Ratings like this. ""Community"" (2.5 million, 1.3), given a shot in the 9 p.m. hour, tied its series low across two episodes, as well as its 8 p.m. episode (3 million, 1.3). At 8:30 p.m., ""30 Rock"" (2.9 million, 1.3) didn't fare any better. At 10 p.m., ""Awake"" (2.1 million, 0.7) was down 22 percent from last week. Fox's ""American Idol"" (15.8 million, 4.2) was up 8 percent. ""Touch"" (6.3 million, 1.8), however, didn't take advantage of its boosted lead in, and fell 5 percent (Fridays!).

"Editor's note: Please be aware that this article contains spoilers. (EW.com) -- After a two-hour finale chock full o' lasers, sparkly catsuits, and fresh faces from the '70s, it was time for a very special seven-minute results show that brutally overlapped with the season finale of ABC's ""Revenge."" Victoria Grayson vs. J. Lo in a jewel-toned gown-off: Who wins? Phillip Phillips! The 21-year-old singer-songwriter-sufferer from Leesburg, Georgia is your season 11 ""American Idol"" winner. Try not to freak out. It's really okay. This is a televised popularity contest and the ""White Guy With Guitar"" happened to get more votes than Jessica Sanchez. It doesn't mean ""American Idol"" is racist. It doesn't mean that Phillip won solely due to his extremely alluring chest hair. These finalists were wildly different. Each had strengths and weaknesses, and both deserved to win. This season, more than ever, it seemed like so many viewers deluded themselves into assuming that the support of one of these kids implied hatred of the other. Are you kidding me? It's a reality show! They'll both get to make records! They've both gotta have it, Ryan! Ugh, sorry, it's just a bizarre sentiment that's run rampant across the internet for the past few weeks AND I AM TELLING YOU I find it utterly ridiculous. If ""American Idol"" fans can't find a way to be happy for an aw-shucks guy who was so overcome with emotion that he couldn't even finish his coronation song, even for a split second, I don't know why they put themselves through the torture of even watching this mess. No one's ever going to figure out a way to get inside America's collective ear and tweak it so that their favorite is the favorite. People like who they like. That's what's great about music. There's more than enough to go around. Never before has ""Idol"" received so many votes! I unexpectedly shuddered when a tall British stranger entered the frame Ã  la The Giant from ""Twin Peaks."" What was this, the Oscars? I imagined that this creature, ""Edward Bodington,"" had slithered out of a giant telescope in order to tell us that ""Telescope has counted and certified a world-record 132 million votes."" OMG -- nobody cares. Read the verdict, Ryan! Phillip and Jessica's ""Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong"" duet, in which the judges played Statues behind the kids and didn't dare look over their shoulders, was the most muted performance of the show. The finalists had very little chemistry beyond a shared sense of politeness and brevity in speech. This was fine -- the rest of the show was packed with enough highs and lows that the finale ended up starring the Top 12 instead of the Top 2. By far the most riveting performance: Jessica Sanchez's duet on ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" with original Broadway ""Dreamgirl"" Jennifer Holliday -- a masterclass for our tiny teen in how to act like there's something, anything, going on underneath a huge vocal. In Jennifer's case, this meant making liberal use of her mouth. Words won't do her facial expressions justice, so I've created this. The fear of being devoured for dinner shot Jessica up into an entirely new stratosphere of performance value. I've never seen her look this alive. She won the competition right here, Ryan! Hopefully Jessica's fans can take solace in her triumph during this ultimate ""Idol"" moment. Meanwhile, Phillip couldn't even croak out a second verse. That bastard! Speaking of complete lunacy, Joshua Ledet and an unbeweavable Fantasia Barrino shared the stage -- or, more accurately, ditched it -- on a blistering scream-off loosely based on the song ""Take Me to the Pilot."" Wait, were they flying? They certainly seemed high enough. I wonder if, when people consider Fantasia from now on, they will remember her not as the season 3 winner dazzling audiences from her perch on the floor, but as the literal embodiment of ""The Shining"" in a sleek long wig and shimmery catsuit with LEG CUTOUTS. Would this have looked more or less ridiculous as a dress? We almost found out as her pants ripped at the end. Cut them off! (Fox did.) Skylar Laine and Reba McEntire's ""Turn on the Radio"" duet was the most genuine feel-good moment of the finale for me. For you? It wasn't the best-sounding performance of the night, but I'm not sure that was their fault. Just seeing Skylar hold her own so fearlessly with her idol would have made me choke up if it were that kind of song. Reba clearly had a blast and engaged with Skylar as an equal. She was definitely NOT about to eat her. Really cool to see. Hollie Cavanagh and Jordina Spahhhks sounded and looked gorgeous belting out ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" in the midst of a deadly smoke monster cloud. The song is a Liverpool football favorite, but as Hollie and Jordin's duet was placed directly following Ace Young and Diana DeGarmo's marriage proposal/off-off-off-off-off-Broadway stage production, it had the unfortunate effect of playing out as an anthem for this couple's love. The proposal started out semi-cute (minus Ace's hair and Diana's general plasticity) but then Ace had to make it creepy and ruin everything by plugging his jeweler. ""Here, I'll hold the box,"" said Ryan Seacrest, whose makeup was running. Ryan had a big night, Ryan! The best parts of Phillip Phillips and John Fogerty's songs together were the random cuts to Carrie Underwood LOVING IT in the audience. Is it crazy to suggest that Carrie should be the one to replace J. Lo next season? I know she's busy -- I know it's late, I know you're weary, I know your plans don't include me -- but a girl can dream. There'd be a whole different dynamic to the panel, and I almost think a former contestant might inspire Randy and Steven to step it up more than any old star would. Plus, imagine the hair and fashion! Fogerty kept looking over at Phillip as if he was very amused. Perhaps Phillip had confided in him that he'd just woken up. We heard a lot from the ""Top 12 guys"" (really just five guys, no Phillip). The return of Neil Diamond prompted my realization that Jeremy Rosado has a significant ""mic hand-ography"" problem I hadn't noticed before. He's still the sweetest, though. The Neil medley and the guys' tribute to the late Robin Gibb were mostly snoozy, but Joshua saved the Bee Gees medley with a standout performance on ""To Love Somebody."" Of course, he'd established his MVP status of the non-finalist Top 12 early in the show with a bold but doomed splits move during the group's cover of ""Runaway Baby."" When it comes to dancing on ""Idol,"" it's the thought that counts. Unless you're Rihanna or J. Lo, in which case it is the reason you're performing onstage. Again. No Elise duet? Boooooo. It's Aerosmith! And they said they'd never get back together. I'm glad to see that former ""American Idol"" pooh-pooh-er Joe Perry has settled into a peaceful place with his Cruella de Vil hairstyle. In their advanced age, the band has become a beautiful, just beautiful patchwork quilt of animal prints and crazy faces. Steven Tyler, that legendary child, never disappoints on a full-length microphone. Maybe he should start scream-singing all of his critiques next season. Put it in his contract, so he can ignore it. ""Now I'd like to show you my organ."" --Steven Tyler, proprietor of the 'Love Shack' dressing trailer. Ewwww. Two more highlights for me: First, J. Lo's attempt to pass off her vicious contempt toward Jimmy Iovine -- who still doesn't know her first name and has no intention of ever figuring it out -- with an eye roll and a giggle. Four eye rolls. Second: The Top 10 (minus the Top 2)'s performance of ""Singing the Phone Book,"" an A.I. original recording, was amazing. The horrified glances could just as easily be directed at Colton Dixon's hair. Who wrote this?! Really listen to the lyrics if you get the chance. They are literally (Randy's fave word) running through the fake yellow pages. The parts about face lifts and ""it's only liposuction"" were delicious, but my personal highlight was ""Ooh, that's one spicy bratwurst"" out of nowhere. The choral robes added a solemn sense of gravity to this heap of ridiculata. Of course, Joshua had to oversing his part. ""Every tahm!"" complained Skylar. And finally, Ev-ery-bo-dy gets a CAR! Wouldn't want to leave that out. #Ford . As EW.com's esteemed appraiser-in-chief, I've never been happier. Thanks for reading these recaps all season. I've had almost as much fun writing them as J. Lo's dropped-crotch shimmery pajamas (available exclusively at Kohl's?) had during her wild romp onstage. Discuss the finale below! Did the right person win?

"(EW.com) -- Is it too soon to make a horror film inspired by the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, in which a vast area of the world was radioactively contaminated following the catastrophic meltdown of a Ukrainian nuclear power plant? No, according to Oren Peli.

"(CNN) -- April 27, 2011, was quite the busy day for my colleagues at CNN.com. It was two days and counting until the royal wedding of Britain's Prince William and Kate Middleton, and the site was getting all its ducks in a row for the big event. But I was nowhere near the newsroom that day. I was in a hotel conference room in another state, auditioning to be on the long-running TV game show ""Jeopardy!"" for the fourth time. For almost 20 years I've tried to get on ""America's Favorite Quiz Show,"" going all the way back to my freshman year in college, where I missed passing the written test by ""one question"" (not really, but the contestant coordinators asked us to say that as they did not reveal actual scores). I've auditioned for the show in three states and the District of Columbia. I traveled eight hours by car for the 2011 audition, and five hours by train for the college test. And I don't regret a single moment of it. I've been told that I'm obsessed with game shows. I prefer to call myself a ""super fan."" I've auditioned for 11 game shows, and appeared on three of them. Back in 2001, I appeared on ABC's ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" following my 80th or so attempt to qualify via phone auditions. I made it to the ""hot seat,"" lasting all of two minutes before I bombed out on a $500 question on collar stays. I went home with nothing, but was invited back a few weeks later to compete in a special game starring all the show's ""zero dollar"" winners. With new found confidence, I bounced back to win $64,000 before calling it a night. I've been a ""phone a friend"" for six ""Millionaire"" contestants until the show dropped the lifeline in 2009. I competed on ESPN's ""Two-Minute Drill"" in 2001, winning $5,000 and getting a chance to chat up Dara Torres and Darryl Dawkins. I appeared as a ""mob member"" on NBC's ""1 vs. 100"" in 2006, falling short on a question regarding salad creators -- I never did watch that ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" episode confirming that Bob Cobb had a namesake salad. And I was an interactive champion on the 2000 Fox Family game ""Paranoia,"" winning a top-of-the-line desktop computer with camera. So how did this all start? I can't pinpoint the exact date I suddenly got interested in game shows, but family members insist it started while I was a crawling toddler. One relative joked (I hope) that my first complete sentence was ""X gets the square,"" a reference to the long-running ""Hollywood Squares."" When I was 6, I was barred from watching ""Family Feud"" after I got caught kissing a first-grade female classmate. When my long-suffering teacher, Mrs. Kaplan, asked me why I did that, I explained that Richard Dawson did it every night, and he didn't get punished. To me, game shows were the place to go to see magic and happiness occur on a daily basis. Where else could you see ordinary Americans win cash and prizes just by answering questions, solving puzzles or performing silly stunts? Game shows gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge beyond what I learned in school, books and newspapers. For a time, getting home from school meant having a snack and working on long division while watching ""The Joker's Wild"" and ""Tic Tac Dough."" More than once, my 9-year-old self squealed in delight for knowing answers that the contestants couldn't handle. The game show hosts were like Santa Claus -- rewarding the ""nice"" contestants with cash, cars and bedroom sets, while punishing the ""naughty"" players with zonks, whammies and lifetime supplies of Turtle Wax and Rice-a-Roni. Over time, the hosts were part of the family. I saw Bill Cullen, who hosted more than 20 game shows in a career spanning five decades, as the grandfatherly figure who was quick with a kind word whether you were happy or sad. Dick Clark, who helmed various incarnations of ""Pyramid,"" was the stern but fair teacher who could throw out a joke, but knew when to be serious. And Richard Dawson was the life of the party, but someone who always made sure that you were having fun, as well. Admittedly, few understood my love of the genre. Classmates were only interested in game shows when they were hip to the crowd, such as ""Press Your Luck"" or MTV's ""Remote Control."" Family members were confused at times, but did play along. One California vacation included a visit to a taping of ""Win, Lose or Draw,"" where I got to chat with game show legend Charles Nelson Reilly between tapings. But, for the most part, my love of the genre was something I kept to myself. And when the genre became passÃ© in the early 90s, and talk shows and similar fare took over the landscape, I simply forgot about big bucks and no whammies. Then came college, adulthood and the World Wide Web. It was there that I found people who were just like me -- game show fans who loved talking about game shows past, present and future. We reviewed shows, compared hosts and rooted each other on as we went out on auditions. One friend sent me a cassette of game show themes that included a cover of ""Route 66"" by Depeche Mode that featured a commercial for the Tom Kennedy version of ""Name That Tune,"" voiced by the legendary Ernie Anderson. Another sent me a ""Price is Right"" coffee mug. A few times we got together in California for a ""Game Show Congress,"" where we honored the past, present and future of the genre. Hosts, producers, announcers and contestants would gather to discuss game shows with fans like me, as well as play our own versions of the games we grew up and watched. It's that sense of community that made me feel blessed when I learned this week that Richard Dawson passed away. As soon as I heard the news, I went online to a game show message board I frequent. There, I read stories from friends and colleagues about how much they enjoyed Dawson's work as an actor and emcee. Through the forum, I found a YouTube clip of a short-lived 1970s game show called ""Masquerade Party,"" which Dawson hosted a few years before ""Family Feud."" And I learned that Dawson may not have been the first choice to host ""Feud;"" Geoff Edwards, Jack Narz and William Shatner were all supposedly under consideration. One of the great things about the online world is that, if you look hard enough, you can find people who share your interests and embrace them. I don't know the size of the game show community, but I know that we are loyal to the genre. My wife and her family have also developed ""game show fever."" My wife, who's more of a casual game show fan, joined me at a Game Show Congress in 2006. She wasn't sure what to expect, but my friends welcomed her with open arms. I still remember her being the top player in a game of ""Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak"" (a short-lived 80s ABC game show hosted by the legendary British emcee). She also helped me recruit three members of her family to audition for the Steve Harvey edition of ""Family Feud"" two years ago. We didn't get the call to play, but we had a ton of fun giving it a try. As for me, I don't know what my future in game shows holds, as I haven't been impressed with the programs that have aired in recent years. Most of them seem to follow the rules of so-called ""reality"" shows -- larger-than-life contestants, silly conflicts and manufactured drama. A few shows stay true to the form I grew up with, but those series are few and far between. Which brings me back to ""Jeopardy!"" As of now, I'm on the waiting list to be a contestant. Between now and the end of the year, I may get a call to be on the show. If not, I'll just wait for the next online test and try again. Either way, I'm not going to let the dream fade away.","The author has a thing for game shows .

"(CNN) -- Ukraine's high court rejected an appeal Wednesday by former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who had challenged her conviction on charges of abuse of authority. She is serving a seven-year prison sentence after she was found guilty of the charges in October. A Ukrainian court said she signed overpriced gas contracts with Russia. The gas deals inflicted damages to the country amounting to more than 1.5 billion hryvnias (almost $185 million at the current exchange rate), the court said, ruling she must repay the money. ""I am disappointed to hear that Yuliya Tymoshenko's final domestic appeal against her October 2011 conviction has been turned down,"" David Lidington, British foreign office minister for Europe, said Wednesday. ""The UK will continue to press Ukraine to end selective justice and to ensure that the opposition is able to participate fully in free and fair parliamentary elections in October."" Amnesty International slammed the verdict as ""politically motivated"" and called for the release of Tymoshenko, who was prime minister from January to September 2005, and December 2007 to March 2010. At the time, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also called for her release and that of other members of her government ""and the restoration of their full civil and political rights."" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Wednesday Washington was ""disappointed by this decision"" to reject Tymoshenko's appeal and urged the Ukraine government to let her go. In April, Tymoshenko went on a three-week hunger strike to draw attention to ""violence and lack of rights"" in her country after she said she was beaten unconscious in prison. The prosecutor said his office investigated her claim of abuse and found no proof to substantiate her allegations, but European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said in April that the Ukrainian Ombudsperson's Office confirmed the report. EU: Ukraine's Tymoshenko beaten in prison . Ashton called on Ukraine ""to examine promptly and impartially any complaints of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."" Clinton also expressed concern over her treatment, saying in May that photos released by the Ombudsperson's Office ""further call into question the conditions of her confinement."" CNN's Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.S. State Department says it's disappointed by the ruling .

"(CNN) -- Czech authorities announced Saturday that they have arrested a 29-year-old man who expressed admiration for Anders Behring Breivik, the self-declared ultranationalist who has admitted killing 77 people in Norway last summer. Video broadcast on Saturday by CT24, a public broadcast station in the Czech Republic, showed the handcuffed suspect flanked by police. Dressed in a short-sleeved shirt, the unidentified man appears to be smiling during much of the videotaped walk. Tomas Tuhy, a regional director of the Czech Republic Police, said authorities confiscated ""police or prisoner"" uniforms during their search of the suspect's apartment, as well as some police equipment. Pictures published on CT24's website showed explosive detonators, firearms, ammunition, and what appears to be a police uniform, that were seized as part of the investigation. The man from Ostrava, the Czech Republic's third largest city located in the eastern part of the country near the Polish border, may have intended to pass himself off as a policeman when waging an attack, police said, as reported by the Czech News Agency. Ostrava police chief Radovan Vojta told reporters Saturday that authorities exercised ""increased caution"" when they went into the suspect's apartment, fearful it might have been rigged with explosives. The suspect ""sympathizes probably with known (killer) Anders Breivik,"" said Tuhy in a press conference covered by state broadcaster CT24. The Czech News Agency added, citing police, that the suspect indicated in e-mails that he was an admirer of Breivik. ""Of course we are checking out that connection,"" Tuhy said, declining to elaborate on how the Czech and Norwegian men might be linked. According to Norwegian authorities, Breivik set off a fertilizer bomb outside the prime minister's office on July 22, 2011, killing eight people. He then took a ferry to Utoya Island, the site of a Labour Party youth camp where more than 700 young adults were meeting, and roamed the island shooting and killing 69 people. Breivik has admitted to carrying out the killings, which he says were necessary to protect Norway from multiculturalism. He is on trial, with authorities' determination of his sanity central to what happens next in the case. The Czech suspect was arrested August 10, according to the Czech News Agency, though authorities didn't announce it until Saturday.","Authorities in the Czech Republic announce they've arrested a 29-year-old man .

"London (CNN) -- Decades after the crime, police are investigating what could be a clue to the burial place of the last unrecovered victim of one of Britain's most notorious killers, ""Moors Murderer"" Ian Brady. Keith Bennett was just 12 years old when he went missing on June 16, 1964, in northern England on his way to visit his grandmother. Brady, who was jailed for life in 1966 for three other child murders committed with the help of his partner Myra Hindley, admitted killing the boy in 1987 but has never disclosed the whereabouts of his body. The other four victims were buried on Saddleworth Moor, a lonely upland expanse in the Pennine hills, near Manchester. Keith's mother, Winnie Johnson, has spent the decades since he vanished searching for her lost son but is herself gravely ill. Now, police are investigating claims that Brady may recently have given details of the burial spot to one of his longtime visitors, in a sealed letter to be passed to Johnson after Brady's death. The information came to light when a documentary filmmaker interviewed a woman who has been acting as Brady's mental health adviser, the Press Association news agency reported. A 49-year-old woman was arrested in South Wales on Thursday on suspicion of preventing the burial of a body without lawful exercise, and has been released on bail pending further inquiries, a Greater Manchester Police statement said. Documents have also been seized from the address and are being examined, police said. In the statement, Martin Bottomley, head of the force's cold case review team, cautioned against leaping to conclusions but said police were taking the lead seriously. ""I want to be explicitly clear about this: Ian Brady has not revealed to police the location of Keith's body,"" he said. ""What we are looking at is the possibility, and at this stage it is only a possibility, that he has written a letter to Keith's mum Winnie Johnson which was not to be opened until after his death. We do not know if this is true or simply a ruse, but we clearly have a duty to investigate such information on behalf of Keith's family. ""Since Keith was so cruelly taken away all those years ago, our thoughts have always been with his family as they try to come to terms with what happened. All they want is to finally be able to lay Keith to rest."" The Moors murders have cast ""a long and dark shadow"" over the area, he said. Police have been in contact with Keith Bennett's family and staff at Ashworth Hospital, the high-security psychiatric institution where Brady is held. He has refused food for the past 12 years, in a bid to die, and is fed through a tube, the Press Association reports. Brady and Hindley were taken by police to Saddleworth Moor to look for the bodies of Bennett and another victim, 16-year-old Pauline Reade, after they admitted those killings in 1987, the news agency says. However, only Reade's remains were found. Keith's brother, Alan Bennett, runs the family's Searching for Keith website, where information about the case is posted, as well as pictures of the family taken before the tragedy. ""He was a son, a brother, a friend and should have been a father, grandfather and maybe a great-grandfather. He should have been whatever he wanted to be,"" Alan Bennett writes. A police poster appealing for information that was put up in shops and windows at the time Keith went missing shows a cheerful, bespectacled boy. Johnson is quoted on the website as saying: ""My greatest hope in this life from the day he left is to have him home, I now accept he is not alive but I still believe I have the right as his mother to give him a Christian burial.""","12-year-old Keith Bennett was a victim of notorious killer Ian Brady in 1964 .

The third chapter in the saga of Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) and his Central Park Zoo pals â€” now nostalgic for New York after their foray into Africa â€” has timing up the wazoo. It's there in a (literally) over-the-top chase through the skies of Monte Carlo, in the grouchy fun of a troupe of Euro circus animals our heroes hook up with, and in bits like Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) singing a circus jingle inspired by his psychedelic Afro wig.

"(EW.com) -- Six weeks ago, ""The Avengers"" entered theaters and blew everyone's expectations out of the water with its record-breaking $207.4 million debut. In the weeks that followed, though, the box office fell into a bit of a slump. Expensive tentpoles like ""Battleship"" and ""Dark Shadows"" outright bombed, while major studio fare like ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" and ""The Dictator"" underperformed, and even ""Men In Black 3's"" number one opening felt weak given its predecessors' strength. Last weekend, ""Snow White and the Hunstman"" exceeded industry expectations, giving Hollywood hope that summer 2012 might live up to the hype that ""The Avengers"" had suggested. This weekend, ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" and and ""Prometheus"" continued to ease any fears that the box office was in trouble with robust debuts in first and second place, respectively. These hefty starts helped the Top 10 films gross $169.6 million, up a whopping 30 percent over the same weekend in 2011, when Super 8 topped the chart. Dreamworks $145 million 3-D sequel ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,"" which features the voice work of Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, and David Schwimmer as lost Central Park Zoo animals, handily won the weekend with $60.4 million, 45 percent of which came from 3-D ticket sales. That's a touch behind 2008â€²s ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,"" which started with $63.1 million, despite the fact that ""Madagascar 3"" earned more on its opening day than ""Escape 2 Africa"" ($20.5 million vs. $17.5 million). It looks like this threequel may suffer from a slight case of sequelitis, when franchise films become increasingly front-loaded at the box office as the franchise continues. ""Madagascar 3"" earned a terrific ""A"" CinemaScore grade from polled audiences, which were 56 percent female and 54 percent below the age of 25, and it will benefit from strong word-of-mouth in the weeks to come. Still, ""Madagascar 3"" will likely finish a bit behind the $180 million total that ""Escape 2 Africa,"" which played during the holiday season, earned domestically. International grosses are already proving to be more substantial, though. ""Madagascar 3"" earned $75.5 million overseas this weekend, giving it an early worldwide total of $135.9 million. The colorful comedy will face direct competition when Pixar's ""Brave"" debuts in two weeks, but its lighthearted tone and zippy pace may prove more attractive for summer moviegoers. We'll have to wait and see! Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi, ""Prometheus,"" invaded theaters in second place with $50 million. The $130 million Fox thriller, which stars Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and current box office (ice) queen Charlize Theron, conjured an impressive $14,723 per theater average from 3,396 locations (ahead of ""Madagascar's"" $14,123 average from 4,258 venues). ""Prometheus"" notched the best debut for an R-rated picture since ""Paranormal Activity 3's"" $52.6 million bow in October, but where it goes from here is anyone's guess. After topping the box office on Friday with $21.4 million, ""Prometheus"" sank 22 percent on Saturday -- a sure sign of built-in excitement from fanboys and fangirls who rushed to the theater to find out if the film really was an ""Alien"" prequel. Discouragingly, ""Prometheus"" earned a lukewarm ""B"" CinemaScore grade, yet it's sparking more post-release conversation than any title in recent memory, and although much of the chatter is negative (and filled with over-the-top vitriol for scribe Damon Lindelof), all the buzz could work in the film's favor. Word-of-mouth doesn't suggest that ""Prometheus"" will become this year's ""Inception,"" a thinky thriller-turned-box-office-smash, but its successful debut and ample international receipts (it's earned $91.5 million after two weekends) should have the suits at Fox pretty happy. Last weekend's fairest movie of them all, ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" bit into the poison apple of competition and dropped 59 percent to $23 million during its second frame. The $170 million fantasy has earned $98.5 million total after ten days, and another $83.5 million overseas. Universal is reportedly fast-tracking a sequel for the film, which frankly seems like a rather irrational decision at this point. While a $181.5 million worldwide total is nothing to shake a stick scepter at, between the budget, marketing costs, and distribution fees, ""Snow White"" has a long way to go before it's out of the red. Still, Universal must see a path to profitability on the home market and ancillary markets. If the studio does make a sequel, I have one request: Bring back Charlize Theron! ""Men In Black 3"" held on to fourth place, dropping 52 percent (after losing many 3-D screens to ""Prometheus"" and ""Madagascar"") to $13.5 million. The $230 million sequel has earned a lackluster $135.5 million after 17 days -- even without accounting for inflation, both ""Men In Black"" and ""Men In Black 2"" (neither of which had 3-D ticket prices working their favor) had earned more money at the same point in their runs, with $158.9 million and $148.0 million, respectively. The Sony production may finish with about $165 million, domestically. Fortunately, international grosses have been powerful, and globally, ""Men In Black 3"" has earned $487.6 million total. Whether the film will eventually earn enough to counteract it's massive negative costs is unclear. (Speaking of negative costs, are you aware that the combined budgets of the Top 5 movies right now total $895 million? Seriously.) Rounding out the Top 5, ""The Avengers"" flew to $10.8 million in its sixth frame -- a 47 percent drop -- which pushed its total to a truly heroic $571.9 million. Worldwide, ""The Avengers"" has grossed a jaw-dropping $1.396 billion. This year's second-biggest blockbuster, ""The Hunger Games,"" reached a major milestone over the weekend. On its 80th day of release, ""Hunger Games"" passed the $400 million mark in the United States -- a remarkable feat for a franchise launching pad. With a $248 million overseas total, the dystopian thriller hasn't exhibited similar box office ubiquity overseas, although this may very well change with future ""Hunger Games"" installments. The film's worldwide total will climb substantially when it opens in China later this month. In limited release, Wes Anderson's well-liked indie ""Moonrise Kingdom"" continues to impress. The young love story picked up $1.6 million in 96 theaters, enough for a tenth place finish. ""Moonrise"" once again boasted a dazzling per theater average: it's $16,448 average was the best at the box office. After three weekends, the film has earned $3.8 million. Fellow indies were met with mixed results. ""Peace, Love, and Misunderstanding"" found a weak $102,000 out of 30 theaters, which was slightly ahead of Sundance fave ""Safety Not Guaranteed,"" which earned $100,000, but was notably playing in just 9 theaters. ""Lola Versus"" earned $34,100 out of 4 theaters, yielding an $8,525 average -- too low to merit major expansions. What did you see this weekend?

"(EW.com) -- Told by a different storyteller -- perhaps in a movie with subtitles and scenes in a Balkan cafÃ© -- ""Girl in Progress"" would qualify as a tragedy, a horror story, an upsetting drama of child abuse. Here's the cautionary tale of an overworked teenaged girl (Cierra Ramirez), neglected by her self-absorbed, single, working-class mother (Eva Mendes), who embarks on a self-destructive plan to speed up her journey to adulthood and escape her mother's chaotic house. Were this movie given the Romanian New Wave narrative treatment, it might win a prize. 'Grey's Anatomy' cast near deals to return . But spiced up with commercial-grade Latin-American content (including a scene or two of warm, Spanish-speaking familia time) and starring the glamorous, likable, and marketable Cuban-American Mendes in a pretend attempt at looking haggard, this inauthentic teen tale, with its cosmetically softened edges, serves neither the young people nor the Mendes fans for whom it might be intended.

"London (CNN) -- London's East End is well known for its dark past, from Jack the Ripper to notorious 1960s gangsters the Krays, so it is no surprise that the area was also the birthplace of the creator of some of Hollywood's most famous scary movies. Alfred Hitchcock is feted as the man behind ""Psycho,"" ""The Birds,"" ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window"" -- but before he made the move stateside, Hitchcock was one of the biggest names in Britain's film industry, and traces of the director and his films can be found across his native city. The British Film Institute has spent the past three years restoring nine of Hitchcock's little-known -- and little-seen -- silent movies, which can now be viewed on the big screen for the first time in almost 80 years. To celebrate, join CNN.com on a tour of Hitchcock's London. Humble beginnings . Alfred Hitchcock was born above his family's greengrocer's shop in Leytonstone, east London in 1899. Sadly, little trace remains of his early life there: His birthplace, at 517 Leytonstone High Road, was demolished many years ago to make way for a gas station and fast food outlet, though eagle-eyed visitors may notice a plaque on the spot. Hitchcock knocks Welles off top film list . As a young boy, an unknowing Hitchcock was sent to the local police station with a note asking the officer on duty to lock him in a cell briefly to warn him what happened to people who misbehaved. Unfortunately, the police station too has been knocked down, but information boards at the site retell the story. There is evidence of the director's links with the area, though: Two modern blocks of flats -- ""Marnie Court"" and ""Topaz Court"" take their names from his films, and a pub -- The Alfred Hitchcock Hotel on the edge of Epping Forest -- is named in his honor. But visitors wanting to catch a glimpse of the city's most colorful tribute to the filmmaker need only step off the underground train: Leytonstone's tube station -- on the Central Line -- is decorated with mosaics featuring scenes from Hitchcock's life and movies. Hitchcock married his long-term collaborator Alma Reville at Brompton Oratory in upmarket Kensington in December 1926. Mass is still celebrated in Latin every day at the imposing Roman Catholic church near the Victoria and Albert Museum. The couple lived close by, at 153 Cromwell Road in Earl's Court, from 1926 until they and their daughter Patricia left for Hollywood shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. A blue plaque marks the building. The silent city . Hitchcock began his cinematic career as a designer, creating the title cards used in silent films, but within five years he was directing the movies themselves. For the rest of his life, he would use London as the setting for many of his films: Some of the city's most famous landmarks serve as backdrops to the action. ""London was his base, even after he had moved to the U.S. and was working in Hollywood. It was the location for many of his films, and it was the subtext that ran through them,"" said Sandra Shevey, who runs a regular walking tour of Hitchcock's London film locations. ""He wanted to show the gory, nasty bits of the city, like the earthy Cockney he always was,"" she told CNN. ""He used London as the prism through which to show the evils of the world, just like Dickens did."" Hitchcock's first big hit came with ""The Lodger,"" (1927) the tale of a serial killer, subtitled ""A Story of the London Fog."" While many of the scenes were filmed in the studio, Westminster, the Embankment and Charing Cross all make an appearance in the film. Nathalie Morris, Hitchcock expert at the British Film Institute, recommends another location from ""The Lodger"" which she says crops up again and again, not only in his movies, but in his life: Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, the force responsible for the capital. ""Hitchcock was a regular visitor to Scotland Yard -- he would visit the 'Black Museum,' the police's crime museum for inspiration, to lap up plenty of macabre details for his films,"" Morris told CNN. The museum, which opened in 1875, is home to a grisly selection of criminal evidence from notorious cases including those of Jack the Ripper and Dr Crippen. It is no longer open to the public, instead being used for police and forensic science training. Another museum played a more direct role in Hitchcock's final silent film -- and first 'talkie' -- ""Blackmail"" (1929). The movie's climactic chase scene takes place across the domed glass roof of the British Museum's old reading room. ""Blackmail"" is one of Morris's top picks for film fans on the lookout for London links to Hitchcock: Other scenes take place in Trafalgar Square, Whitehall and Lower Regent Street. Tourist hotspots . Morris also highlights 1936's ""Sabotage,"" one of the final movies Hitch made before moving to the U.S. in 1939. Opening at the then-newly-built Battersea Power Station (now little more than a shell of a building), the film is a filmic feast of the city's tourist hotspots: Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus and London Zoo all feature, alongside one of the director's favorite restaurants, Simpson's-in-the-Strand. The interior shots of Simpson's were filmed in the studio. Sadly, as with many of the locations linked to the director's life, these have since been demolished, but at the site of the former Gainsborough Studios in Islington -- now transformed into an apartment complex -- a huge sculpture of Hitchcock's head (by artist Antony Donaldson) commemorates his time there. Even after he had left the UK, Hitchcock frequently returned to London to film. Interestingly, Morris points out that he was not actually present when one of the most memorable London scenes in his work was captured on film: The assassin's fatal fall from the belltower of Westminster Cathedral in ""Foreign Correspondent."" ""Deaths from a height are such an important Hitchcockian motif, but because the war was on, Hitchcock could not come to London, and so it was filmed by a second unit,"" she said. The byzantine-style Catholic cathedral would also play another role in Hitchcock's life, some four decades later: It was the location of a memorial service for the director, following his death in 1980. For Shevey, Hitchcock's key London films are ""The Man Who Knew Too Much,"" ""The Parradine Case,"" and ""Frenzy,"" all of which, she says, feature ""some of the most beautiful buildings in London,"" from Portland Place and the Royal Albert Hall to Tower Bridge and Covent Garden Market. ""Frenzy"" in particular is rooted in its London location, the old fruit and vegetable market and the streets and pubs nearby: The Globe, in Bow Street, and the Nell of Old Drury in Catherine Street. It would be his last movie made in the city . ""'Frenzy' was his homecoming film,"" Morris told CNN. ""It brings him full circle, back to the London of 'The Lodger.'"" Next steps . If all this has wetted your appetite, then head to the BFI Southbank, which is currently showing an entire ""Genius of Hitchcock"" season featuring all of the director's surviving movies, including those early silent films. The BFI's Mediatheque also offers the chance to view interviews, rarely-seen clips and other material linked to Leytonstone's most famous son. You can also join an organized tour of Hitchcock's London. Sandra Shevey's Alfred Hitchcock London Locations Walk, which runs three times a week and lasts for three hours, is illustrated with the original storyboards for ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and excerpts from Shevey's own interview with Hitchcock himself. London Walks also runs occasional Hitchcock and London on Film-themed tours -- its next ""Hitchcock's London: More than 39 Steps!"" walk is planned for October 14.

"(EW.com) -- Sony's $230 million alien-zapping sequel ""Men In Black 3"" topped the box office over the three-day weekend frame with an estimated $55 million. Although the Will Smith action-comedy didn't exactly trip out of the gate, ""Men In Black 3's"" start is troubling considering its gigantic budget and supposed built-in audience. Fortunately, as is so often the case these days, international results proved stronger. Sony says the film has taken in $132 million overseas in its initial week of release. Marvel's ""The Avengers"" held strong in second place with $37 million -- a 34 percent drop from last weekend. The superhero ensemble crossed the $500 million mark on Saturday, its 23rd day of release, effectively smashing the record previously held by ""Avatar,"" which took 32 days to reach the same milestone. It's earned $513.7 million total. Last weekend's openers ""Battleship"" and ""The Dictator"" took up the next two spots on the chart. ""Battleship"" plummeted 58 percent (on a holiday weekend no less!) to $10.8 million, giving it a 10-day total of $44.3 million against a $209 million budget. ""The Dictator,"" meanwhile, dropped by a more modest (but still not that great) 45 percent to $9.6 million, resulting in a $41.4 million 12-day total. Rounding out the Top 5, the Oren Peli-produced horror horror flick ""Chernobyl Diaries"" couldn't achieve ""Paranormal Activity""-sized numbers. ""Chernobyl"" earned a weak $8 million in three days -- with $3.5 million of that coming from Friday alone (a sure sign of frontloadedness). 1. ""Men In Black 3"" -- $55.0 million . 2. ""The Avengers"" -- $37.0 million . 3. ""Battleship"" -- $10.8 million . 4. ""The Dictator"" -- $9.6 million . 5. ""Chernobyl Diaries"" -- $8.0 million .

"(EW.com) -- ""Battleship"" is a special-effects-heavy movie invented to extend the brand of a commercial board game -- suitable for ages 7 and up! -- in which two players move imaginary boats around a simple grid. That part's not newsworthy. The surprise, for this veteran of board games, is that ""Battleship"" is also the rousing, engaging, and emotionally complex action war picture the silly 2001 action war picture ""Pearl Harbor"" only wished it could be. It's ""Pearl Harbor"" with greater intelligence, less hokum, and more aliens. For every line of howler dialogue that should have been sunk, there's a nice little scene in which humans have to make a difficult decision. For every stretch of generic sci-fi-via-CGI moviemaking, there's a welcome bit of wit. Under the direction of Peter Berg -- the talented, ever-maturing filmmaker behind ""Friday Night Lights"" and ""The Kingdom"" -- ""Battleship"" is a sound vessel floating in Hollywood's oil-slick sea of ""Transformers"" sequels and vampire riffs. The object of the original game is simple: Attack an opponent's ''fleet'' through a combination of mental strategy, deductive logic, and luck. The movie doesn't forget these low-tech roots. There's a nifty sequence in which sailors track incoming alien fighters using similar X-marks-the-spot skills. But before getting to the hardcore blow-'em-up portion of the humans-versus-aliens warfare entertainment, we are given time to invest in the relationship between Stone Hopper (""True Blood's"" Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd) and his younger brother, Alex (Taylor Kitsch from TV's ""Friday Night Lights"") -- the former a courageous Navy officer of great character, the latter a corner-cutting showboater who is about to have his character entirely re-welded through the Navy challenges that await him. (Kitsch does an admirable, controlled job of steering his character from screwup to leader.) We understand that Alex loves a bombshell physical therapist named Sam (Brooklyn Decker), and that Sam happens to be the daughter of crusty U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson, barking but not biting). We see the emotional-zeitgeist logic in the special interest that Sam has taken in the physical rehabilitation of an Army veteran and amputee, authentically played by real-life Army vet and amputee Gregory D. Gadson. We appreciate the pop culture traffic jam that has musical glam girl Rihanna passing muster as a tough (yet cool!) fellow sailor. And we know to keep an eye on the conflict that rumbles at first between Alex and a Japanese officer (Tadanobu Asano) because Japanese-American hurts and fears left over from the real Pearl Harbor will be worked out before the movie is over for the benefit of boomers and assorted granddads in the audience. It's only once we know all these things -- carbon-based touches not found in the Hasbro product -- that ""Battleship"" gets down to the business of hotshot combat between brave U.S. Navy fighters and aggressive alien visitors. (The invaders, by the way, appear to have studied ""Transformers"" fashion magazines to design their space-metal wardrobes.) Amid this fracas, there's a welcome mood lightener in the form of a gentle comic-neurotic turn by Hamish Linklater (""The New Adventures of Old Christine"") as a deep-space scientist who has reason to regret his search for extraterrestrial life. ""Battleship"" is gratifying that way. At the story's center are all the clanging fireballs a kid could want to watch whizzing across a computerized sky -- not to mention naval strategy and a fact-based demonstration of real destroyer-ship capabilities. And surrounding the alien rumpus, the filmmakers have built an unexpectedly sincere salute to the awesome responsibilities of today's U.S. Navy as well as to the heroic work of veterans who came before. For all that, the captains of this movie deserve a medal. B+ . See the full article at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- Hollywood loves a cash cow, and Heidi Murkoff's pregnancy bible surely qualifies. It spent more than a decade on The New York Times' best-seller lists, and there are some 17 million copies in print. So what if there's no story? There's a name -- and as all parents know, that's a major achievement in itself. So, what to expect from ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" -- the movie? Like other recent ""concept"" films, those cynical date movies -- ""Valentine's Day"" and ""New Year's Eve"" for instance -- the film wears a celebrity-studded thong to cover any perceived shortcomings in the script department. They come in all shapes and sizes, new and old. Kids your kids will know like Anna Kendrick, and Chace Crawford, TV personalities like ""Glee's"" Matthew Morrison and Cheryl Cole (playing herself) rubbing shoulders with inescapable media magnets like Chris Rock and Jennifer Lopez. We even get celebrities playing celebrities: Cameron Diaz as motivational weight-loss guru/dance show winner Jules, Elizabeth Banks as baby store owner/nursery book author Wendy, Dennis Quaid as Wendy's overbearing father-in-law, an ex-NASCAR champ, Ramsey. These aren't people you meet in my neighborhood, but types we know well from talk shows and supermarket tabloids, and see, here's the point, when it comes to obstetrics, they're just like you and me: anxious, nauseous, excited, and at the mercy of the fates. Screenwriters Shauna Cross and Heather Hach hop between half a dozen couples, most of them residents of Atlanta, and each allocated a representative pregnancy issue. Holly and Alex (Lopez and Rodrigo Santoro) are adopting a Kenyan baby, but he's getting cold feet and she's losing her best-paid gig. Rival food cart chefs Rosie and Marco (Kendrick and Crawford) get pregnant on their first date, and don't know if they're ready to remake ""Knocked Up"" so soon. Meanwhile Wendy wants everything to be just perfect but isn't prepared for the gas. ... The jokes are feeble and the conflicts never transcend sitcom material -- in other words, ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" is entirely predictable and not a little redundant. The days when the movies would discreetly close the door when a woman went into labor (""Hot water, and lots of it!"") are long gone. It's been nearly 30 years since Murkoff's book was first published, and there's hardly an aspect of pregnancy that hasn't been channeled into Hollywood clichÃ©. Which isn't to deny there's something reassuring about seeing other people going through this stuff one more time. Perhaps the saddest aspect of what is largely, admittedly, an inoffensive and anodyne enterprise, is the sad spectacle of Rock and chums wheeling strollers through the park in the service of lame gags about baby-whipped dads. As far as we've come, it would seem that half the world's parents are still little more than a laughingstock. Final word: not worth the sitter.","The movie is based on Heidi Murkoff's pregnancy bible .

"(CNN) -- I didn't know anything about ""The Watch"" going in -- somehow missed the trailers, interviews and TV spots that must have been out there. All I knew was the cast: Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade, which seemed like a good start. Stiller narrates the movie, takes no time at all to declare his Ohio town the best place in the universe and proudly introduces himself as the manager of a certain warehouse store that I won't name here (but which must have swallowed up half the budget, judging by the constant name-checking). Then, weirdly, the movie ditches the focus on Evan (Stiller) and stays with the store's night-shift security guard, a guy called Antonio who's celebrating becoming a U.S. citizen by helping himself to a little vodka and ""Wild Things"" on a dozen high-definition TV screens at once. And suddenly, there's green gunk everywhere. What on earth's going on? What kind of Ben Stiller movie is this? These are legitimate questions, I think, but neither director Akiva Schaffer (from ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Hot Rod"") nor screenwriting team Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg of ""Superbad"" and Jared Stern can muster entirely convincing answers. The basic plot: Evan forms a neighborhood watch committee to solve the Antonio mystery, enlisting three misfit volunteers to the cause and soon enough comes face to face with the kind of illegal alien you're more likely to meet in a Ridley Scott horror movie. In other words, this is your typical buddy comedy sci-fi paranoia thriller -- a lot like ""The Burbs"" and a bit like ""Paul,"" which Rogen starred in and ""Superbad's"" Greg Mottola directed -- but with less in the way of quirky charm and a whole lot more jokes about male genitalia. Anyone who saw ""Superbad"" knows the phallus looms large in Rogen's and Goldberg's comic imagination. But that movie was about hormonal adolescents. Apparently the specter of the penis is not diminished in the minds of middle-aged men. Evan is, in his words, ""shooting blanks,"" and can't bring himself to admit it to his ovulating wife (Rosemarie DeWitt). His partner in crime-busting, Bob (Vaughn), is equally obsessed with the condoms he sees his teenage daughter's boyfriend buying. As for the polite Englishman who joins them, Jamarcus (Ayoade), he just wants to join in a community activity -- and fantasizes about the sexual rewards that may accrue to a local hero. That leaves Franklin (Hill), a dropout who failed to measure up in the eyes of town cop Sgt. Bressman (Will Forte), and who's willing to put on a dress and go all the way with a suspicious neighbor (R. Lee Ermey) just to prove his manhood. These are all funny guys, and they do their best to make up for a slapdash script that must have taken all of a weekend to toss off. But Schaffer shows his inexperience by playing everything for laughs. Another director might have given us scares and suspense as well as these infinite riffs on emasculated men pretending to be cops. The movie has one exceptional sequence, though it froze the smile on my face. Evan has killed his first extraterrestrial, and the guys decide to take photographic evidence -- a ritual that immediately descends into sexual simulation. It's a goof on the infamous Abu Ghraib photos, a moment of jet-black satire that's both subversive and tasteless. It's also much toothier than anything else in this flaccid movie.","""The Watch"" stars Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill .

"(CNN) -- That which does not kill us only makes us laugh. That seems to be the governing principle in this outrageously offensive, but ridiculously funny, effort from agent provocateur Sacha Baron Cohen. The ""Borat"" star has now exhausted the characters he introduced in ""Da Ali G Show"" and presumably worn out his welcome as a celebrity interviewer. In ""The Dictator,"" his third and most outwardly conventional Hollywood vehicle, he introduces us to one ""General Admiral Aladeen,"" a North African despot who resembles Libya's Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, but with an Osama bin Laden beard, and something of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's knack for international diplomacy. (The film is dedicated to the memory of the late Kim Jong Il.) Summoned to the United Nations to explain his country's mushrooming nuclear weapons program, Aladeen plans to throw down the gauntlet, but instead he's abducted from his hotel room and only escapes assassination by the skin of his teeth. This close shave leaves him unrecognizably clean shaven, alone and anonymous on the streets of New York, supplanted by an idiot double under the control of his conniving uncle (played by Ben Kingsley). Mistaken for a political refugee by the well-meaning manager of a vegan cooperative grocery store (played by Anna Faris), Aladeen embarks on a new career in the service industry until he can get his country back. There's nothing very original in this scenario, except perhaps for the unthinking brutality of the hero. Baron Cohen and his regular collaborator director Larry Charles scarcely concern themselves putting the mechanics of the plot in place. As a piece of storytelling ""The Dictator"" is perfunctory to the point of disdain. In their previous efforts these merry pranksters have operated on the margins of documentary, improvising recklessly with the unpredictable dynamics of volatile situations and unsuspecting dupes. Such mockery took cunning and courage, as well as brilliantly quick comic reflexes. At its best it exposed the venal hypocrisy, ignorance and prejudice lurking just beneath the surface of polite society. Perhaps sensing that they're inherently on safer but also more sterile ground here, working with actors and from a script, they compensate with a barrage of bad taste and near-the-knuckle gags. There is something to offend just about everyone: 9/11 jokes, rape jokes, race jokes, child abuse jokes, you name it. A barking chauvinist bigot, Aladeen makes Borat look like a puppy dog. But he's certainly bracing company, the scourge of political correctness and a walking litmus test of our commitment to free speech. We've seen plenty of taboo-busting comedies over the last few years, but this one really goes for the jugular. Lesbians, the disabled, the Chinese, several Hollywood stars, Muslims and Jews all have reasons to cringe. Baron Cohen is an equal opportunities agitator; he takes on everybody at once and dares you not to laugh. How can you not, when Aladeen attempts to impersonate a Chinese-American tourist by pressing his fingers to his eyes and pronouncing his ""r""s and ""l""s, apparently convinced of his acting prowess after starring in several vanity projects back home in Wadiya. The joke is more sophisticated than it first appears when you consider that it's performed by an English Jew, caricaturing a North African Muslim. For all its crudity and occasional flatness, ""The Dictator"" is a satire that takes no prisoners and valuable for that reason. In his big climactic speech, even the irredeemable Aladeen rises to the occasion with a brilliant piece of political oratory that turns the tables on everything we think we know about today's cultural jihad. It's a superbly cheeky cinematic coup worthy of another great English comedian, Charlie Chaplin.","Sacha Baron Cohen introduces us to one ""General Admiral Aladeen,"" a despot .

"(EW.com) -- Spider-Man has been knocked off ... and not by The Lizard. Fox's ""Ice Age: Continental Drift,"" the fourth film in the animated franchise, won the weekend with an estimated $46 million opening at the box office. The family-friendly flick bowed in 3,881 theaters and earned an $11,853 per-theater average over the Friday-to-Sunday period. The film has already made roughly seven times that much in foreign territories. Compared to the previous installments in the ""Ice Age"" series, ""Continental Drift"" fell smack dab between the second and third film's openings. And thanks to an bullish ""A-"" grade from CinemaScore, ""Continental Drift"" should get some strong word of mouth and hold up well with younger audiences and their parents. In second place, Peter Parker & Co. spun $35 million over the weekend, a drop of 43.6 percent. If weekend estimates hold, the Sony tentpole will cross the $200 million mark, landing at $200.9 million. Psychologically at least, that's an important threshold for ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" -- especially with Bruce Wayne on deck at the multiplex. Taking the bronze for the weekend was ""Ted"" â€” Universal's Mark Wahlberg/Mila Kunis/talking bear comedy. The film scored a strong third week haul of $22.1 million, dropping just 31.2 percent â€” thanks in part to the fact that it added 47 playdates. Its total domestic take is now $158.9 million. In fourth, ""Ice Age's"" main 'toon challenger, ""Brave,"" stayed strong adding $10.6 million more to its quiver. Its four-week total is now $195.5 million, which means it should cross the $200 million mark by next weekend. Rounding out the top five is Warner Bros.' stripper comedy ""Magic Mike."" The Channing Tatum flick bumped and grinded for $9 million in its third frame, edging out Oliver Stone's ""Savages,"" and bringing its total to $91.8 million. One notable performance bubbling under the top 10 was this summer's indie critical darling, Fox Searchlight's ""Beasts of the Southern Wild,"" which jumped from No. 21 to No. 16 after quadrupling the number of the theaters it was in. The film earned $775,000 on 81 screens for a terrific $9,568 per-screen average â€” second only to ""Ice Age"" in the top 20. See the full article at EW.com.

"(EW.com) -- Alright, here are the facts about The Dark Knight Rises: . • Warner Bros.' $250 million sequel is an utterly huge movie. • It earned $64.1 million in its second weekend (a 60 percent drop). • It has grossed $289.1 million after ten days. • This total is less than the The Dark Knight had earned at the same point in its run ($313.8 million), and that's fine. • This total is also less than the The Avengers had earned at the same point in its run ($373.1 million), and that's also fine. • Overseas, the film has already grossed $248.2 million, and its headed for a finish between $900 million and $1 billion worldwide. The reality is that it doesn't matter if the conclusion to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy beats any other film at the box office — The Dark Knight Rises is a truly gigantic hit that will have the suits at the studio very, very happy. That said, the film is certainly performing below initial expectations. Things looked rather dire on Friday, when Rises had to compete against the widely watched Olympic opening ceremonies and earned $18.1 million — a whopping 76 percent drop from its first Friday. But it stabilized nicely over the rest of the weekend. Rises ticked up 44 percent on Saturday to $25 million and is estimated to earn another $21.1 million today. Altogether, that's $64.1 million — good for a robust $14,549 per theater average — but a 60 percent drop from the film's $160.9 million debut. That weekend drop indicates that Rises won't have the same legs as The Dark Knight, which ultimately found $533.3 million, so a domestic finish in the $450 million range seems likely. Many who expected the film to earn Avengers-sized numbers are pointing to the tragic Aurora shooting as the main reason for the film's lower-than-expected business, but at this point, I believe that word-of-mouth is a bigger factor. While the film scored an ""A"" CinemaScore grade, critical reviews are not nearly as strong, and Bane is a less dynamic/marketable villain than Heath Ledger's Joker. Still, as I keep reiterating, The Dark Knight Rises is an enormous hit. In second place, Fox's frozen animation Ice Age Continental Drift gathered $13.3 million in its third weekend, lifting its domestic total to $114.8 million — the lowest domestic total ever for an Ice Age movie after 17 days (including the original, which had $116.9 million at the same point), though still quite strong. Fortunately for Fox, the film has already grossed $511 million overseas, and it's far from done with its run. Fox's other big release, The Watch, debuted in third place with an awful $13 million. The $68 million R-rated comedy, which stars Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Jonah Hill, started off even lower than Adam Sandler's recent R-rated misfire That's My Boy, which grossed $13.5 million its opening weekend and $36.5 million overall. Originally titled Neighborhood Watch, Fox was forced to change the film's title and make a marketing about-face in February following the shooting of Trayvon Martin by Florida neighborhood watch officer George Zimmerman. Suddenly, Fox brought the film's alien invasion plotline to the surface (something the studio was avoiding following John Carter and Battleship), but audiences never really got a clear picture of the film's storyline. Of course, terrible reviews didn't help, either, as American audiences have proven themselves rather savvy at avoiding poor comedies (The Watch, What to Expect When You're Expecting, That's My Boy) and flocking to stronger ones (21 Jump Street, Ted) as of late. The audiences that did see The Watch were 60 percent male and 59 percent 25-years-old or older, according to Fox. Those patrons issued The Watch a ""C+"" CinemaScore grade. Step Up Revolution, Summit's $33 million sequel, finished the weekend in fourth place with $11.8 million — by far the lowest for a Step Up movie. Diminishing returns were expected, though. The original Step Up, which starred Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, opened with $20.7 million and earned $65.3 million in 2006. Sequel Step Up 2 The Streets debuted with $18.9 million and found $58 million total in 2008. Step Up 3-D opened with $15.8 million and grossed $42.4 million in 2010. All three predecessors were produced by Touchstone Pictures and distributed by Disney. The franchise has now changed hands to Summit. Despite the low debut, Revolution, which earned a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade, isn't a lost cause for Summit. International grosses for Step Up 3-D reached $116.9 million — a franchise high — and they may be the saving grace for Step Up Revolution as well. (Plus we all know that Step Up movies will never really die. If direct-to-DVD American Pie and Bring It On titles are still getting made, there must be room on Walmart shelves for low-budget Step Up spinoffs, too.) Rounding out the Top 5 was Universal's $50 million smash comedy Ted, which took in another $7.4 million, lifting its five-week total to $193.6 million and guaranteeing that it will pass the $200 million mark domestically very soon. 1. The Dark Knight Rises -- $64.1 million . 2. Ice Age: Continental Drift -- $13.3 million . 3. The Watch -- $13.0 million . 4. Step Up Revolution -- $11.8 million . 5. Ted -- $7.4 million .

"(EW.com) -- ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" was awoken to the tune of $56.3 million this weekend, according to studio estimates. That's a big win for Universal Pictures, especially considering that the studio's last film, the sinking big-budget bomb known as ""Battleship,"" opened to less than half that amount two weeks ago. ""Snow White"" also marked the best debut for star Kristen Stewart outside the ""Twilight"" franchise, and the second-best start for Charlize Theron after ""Hancock."" The film skewed female, but just barely, as 53 percent of its crowd consisted of women. The PG-13 revisionist fairy tale was also pretty evenly split between younger and older moviegoers, with 52 percent being at least 30 years old. Audiences liked but didn't love the film, which received an okay ""B"" rating from CinemaScore participants. Considering that Universal spent $170 million producing the picture, ""Snow White"" needs to hold moderately well the next few weeks. But even if the movie doesn't wind up being a huge moneymaker, it at least avoided the fate of ""Battleship"" and is the first major post-""Avengers"" flick to exceed industry expectations. In second place, ""Men in Black 3"" held up fairly well, dropping 46 percent for $29.3 million. The $230 million threequel has so far earned $112.3 million domestically in 10 days -- just slightly behind where ""Men in Black"" ($118.8 million) and ""Men in Black II"" ($115.6 million) were at the same point -- and an impressive $386.9 million worldwide. Of course, that's nothing compared to ""The Avengers,"" which fell 45 percent for $20.3 million and walked away with two notable achievements. First, the Marvel superhero movie passed ""The Dark Knight's"" $533.3 million tally to become the third-highest-grossing domestic release ever, behind only ""Avatar"" ($760.5 million) and Titanic ($658.6 million). While ""The Avengers"" should be able to reach the $600 million mark, it'll almost certainly fall short of those two James Cameron productions. Still, No. 3 is not a bad place to be, especially when you're also talking about the worldwide record board. Over the weekend, ""The Avengers"" passed ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2"" to become the third biggest movie ever globally. The movie has so far smashed $1.36 billion worldwide. Though again, third place is likely where it'll stay, as ""Avatar"" and ""Titanic"" are way out in front with $2.78 billion and $2.19 billion, respectively. Rounding out the top five were ""Battleship"" and ""The Dictator"" with $4.8 million and $4.7 million. In limited release, Wes Anderson's critically acclaimed ""Moonrise Kingdom"" continued to dominate, collecting $849,000 at just 16 theaters for a per-location average of $53,000. The Mexican historical drama ""For Greater Glory,"" starring Andy Garcia and Eva Longoria, settled for a decent $1.8 million at 757 theaters. But the horror-comedy sequel ""Piranha 3DD"" mustered only $179,000 at 86 locations, while the Adrien Brody comedy ""High School"" flunked out with just $80,600 at 200 sites -- that's $403 per theater. If one assumes each theater played ""High School"" five times per day, then each screening was attended by an average of three moviegoers. 1. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" -- $56.3 mil . 2. ""Men in Black 3"" -- $29.3 mil . 3. ""The Avengers"" -- $20.3 mil . 4. ""Battleship"" -- $4.8 mil . 5. ""The Dictator"" -- $4.7 mil . See full story at EW.com.

"(EW.com) -- A sci-fi reboot and kiddie sequel were no match for the third weekend of Christopher Nolan's blockbuster Batman finale. The Dark Knight Rises led the box office for a third weekend in a row, grossing $36.4 million and giving Warner Bros.' $250 million-budgeted Batman sequel $354.6 million domestically after 17 days. The film enjoyed a healthy 41 percent decline from its previous frame, and if its weekend estimate holds up, Rises will have notched a slimmer third weekend drop than The Dark Knight, which fell 43 percent to $42.7 million during its third weekend, thereby lifting its total to $393.8 million. The slim drop does not mean that Rises will outgross The Dark Knight domestically — it has virtually no chance of catching its $533.3 million total — but it may very well outdo its predecessor worldwide thanks to stronger international grosses. The Dark Knight grossed $468.6 million overseas, which gave it a jaw-dropping $1.002 billion cume worldwide. After three weekends, Rises has earned $378.4 million internationally (for a $733 million worldwide total), and it looks like it is headed past the $1 billion mark as well. Although naysayers may point out that The Dark Knight Rises is performing below original domestic expectations, the film is clearly a hit. 'Breaking Bad': 'Fifty-One' thoughts? Sony reboot Total Recall started its run in second place with $26 million, only a touch higher than 1990′s Total Recall, which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and opened with $25.5 million. If we adjust for inflation, the 1990 version, which ultimately grossed $119.4 million, opened to the equivalent of about $45 million and earned about $215 million in today's dollars. Sony says it spent $125 million on the reboot (some reports suggest the budget reached $200 million), but with poor reviews and a weak ""C+"" CinemaScore, the film will almost certainly not recoup its budget (or its marketing costs) domestically. For star Colin Farrell, whose career held such promise in the early 2000s, Total Recall is the latest in a long line of box office misfires. With the exception of Horrible Bosses (in which Farrell appeared in a supporting role), every wide release he has led since 2004′s Alexander has sputtered financially. Alexander grossed $34.3 million against a whopping $155 million budget. 2006′s Miami Vice earned $63.5 million against a $135 million budget. 2008′s Pride and Glory and 2011′s Fright Night, both of which cost $30 million, earned only $15.8 million and $18.3 million, respectively. 'Expendables 2': 'Last Supper' poster . Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days took third place with $14.7 million, the lowest debut by far for a Wimpy Kid film. The original Diary started with $22.1 million in 2010, and the sequel Rodrick Rules began with $23.8 million in 2011. Notably, both those films opened in March rather than the relative dead zone of August. On the other hand, Dog Days will likely see better weekday grosses than its predecessors thanks to schools being out for the summer. Fox spent $22 million on Dog Days, and though it won't be a smash for the studio, it certainly won't be a pock on its record. Still, the franchise's viability may be in question following the low opening. The young target audience for the Wimpy Kid films, many of whom read the popular books the films are based on, may well have outgrown the franchise in just two years. Fox will need to lure new viewers in order to maintain box office viability. Fortunately, audiences — which were 58 percent female and 62 percent below the age of 25 — liked what they saw and issued the film an ""A-"" CinemaScore, which should lead to good word-of-mouth. 'Great Gatsby' moving to summer 2013 . Two more Fox films filled up the next two spots on the chart. Ice Age: Continental Drift finished its fourth weekend in fourth place, dipping 37 percent to $8.4 million. The frozen 'toon has earned $131.9 million total. Last weekend's underperforming comedy The Watch continued its sorry run, falling 50 percent to $6.4 million. After 10 days, the Ben Stiller/Vince Vaughn/Jonah Hill vehicle has earned a sad $25.4 million against a $68 million budget. Two films reached major milestones this weekend. In sixth place, Ted earned another $5.5 million, which pushed its total past $200 million. The comedy, which has earned $203.4 million domestically against a $50 million budget, has a chance of becoming Universal's biggest hit this year if it passes The Lorax's $214 million cume. It's also cleaning up overseas, where it has earned $77.3 million (including $14.3 million in the U.K. this weekend) early in its run. In eighth place, Sony's The Amazing Spider-Man reached $250.7 million during its fifth weekend. The franchise reboot is just shy of $700 million worldwide. 1.

"(CNN) -- The sparkling blue waters of Hawaii run through Jack Johnson's veins like lifeblood. As his fans know, the superstar singer-songwriter was born and raised in America's 50th state. The island's rich volcanic soil grounds him, and its rolling white surf beckons to him each and every morning -- just as it did to his dad and brothers while they were growing up on Oahu's pristine North Shore.

We do a lot of plastic-free initiatives, trying to get kids to bring their own bags and water bottles. Things like that."" Over the past eight years, the multiplatinum artist has headlined a half-dozen music festivals in Hawaii to fund the organization. He's been joined onstage by an impressive list of famous friends, from Eddie Vedder, Dave Matthews and Ben Harper to Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne and Ziggy and Damian Marley. It's a casual, acoustic affair with an electric trolley shuttle, bike valets and biodegradable eating utensils.

To Forrest, though, running his moonshine racket as an independent business is his right as an American. Taking this stand means he's going to face an army of goons, and Hardy, speaking in low, flat, almost musically macho tones, has the bruiser charisma of a caveman Kevin Costner. It's not the money he's clinging to -- it's the freedom. Sage Stallone died from heart condition . ""Lawless"" is really a Western, with Forrest guarding his turf as fearlessly as Gary Cooper in ""High Noon"" or Warren Beatty in ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller."" The film, written by Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat, is a sturdy piece of traditionalism with outrÃ© touches (like Mark Lanegan's cover of the Velvet Underground's ''White Light/White Heat,'' the perfect anachronistic filigree for a story about white lightning). 'Possession' aims to seize box office crown . But ""Lawless"" still felt remote to me. The surrounding drama (Shia LaBeouf as the Bondurant kid brother, a greenhorn who learns to fight like a man; Jessica Chastain as a barkeep who swoons for Forrest) is stuffy and derivative. Hardy's presence is compelling, but the film comes fully alive only when it turns bloody. At those moments, though, it has the kick of a mule. Grade: B . See the full article at EW.com.

"(Rolling Stone) -- ""This guy looks like he was created by Wes Anderson,"" says Black Keys frontman Dan Auerbach as Pulp's Jarvis Cocker gambols across the stage. It's a couple of hours before the duo's show on the first night of this year's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney are hanging on a couch in a backstage trailer, checking out Pulp's opening set on a flat-screen TV. ""Holy smokes,"" Auerbach continues, as Cocker gesticulates at the huge crowd just a few yards from where the Keys sit. ""Man, he's going for it."" Carney stares at the screen. ""Maybe we should take some theater lessons."" ""I know, man,"" says Auerbach with a wry grin. ""We suck."" This year marked the Black Keys' fifth trip to Coachella, and their debut as mainstage headliners. ""I like to remember the first time we played Coachella, in '04,"" Carney says. ""It was hot as f****** balls. We were sweating our a**** off, and there were very few people there."" ""It was in a tent with no ventilation,"" Auerbach adds. ""It was the kind of hot where you're completely drenched, except for the top of your head where the heat's coming out of."" Carney chuckles. ""So if we can make it through that, which is basically, like, Navy SEALs hell week for rock & roll -- this is, like, the Palm Springs retirement."" ""Yeah,"" Auerbach says. ""We made it. We're, like, super-tough now. Tough as nails."" Tonight, the Keys return to Coachella as the festival expands for the first time to a two-weekend blow-out. ""We actually had a blue-light special at our agent's office,"" Carney deadpans. ""Buy one, you get two."" But they weren't planning any major setlist changes. Says Carney, ""We were told not one person from this festival will be there next weekend."" ""That's what they told us,"" Auerbach adds slyly. ""We've also been told that 99 percent of the people here came to see us. We've also been told that we're Number One on the radio everywhere. We've surrounded ourselves with yes-men."" Carney struggles to keep a straight face. ""Yeah. We actually hired some of LeBron's old people."" The Keys have a busy year ahead, with gigs booked in Europe, North America and Australia, but they hope to get cracking on the follow-up to this year's ""El Camino"" during breaks from the road. ""We're going to start soon,"" Carney says. ""We're not sure how long it'll take, but I think we'd both like to put another record out next year. We've got to keep rolling the dice."" ""Daddy needs a new car,"" says Auerbach. ""Yeah,"" Carney adds. ""We have to buy our dads new Yugos."" See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- Shirley Manson recalls how Garbage came to call their new album ""Not Your Kind of People."" ""Butch came in one day and he said, 'I've got this title for a song that I think you're really going to like. It's we're 'Not Your Kind of People.' And I was like, 'Ooh yeah, I do love that title. Actually, I think that would make a great title for the record!'"" ""Not Your Kind of People"" would also become a mission statement for the post-grunge quartet's first CD in seven years. ""I think we've come to the realization that it's OK to be a bit odd,"" said Manson. ""It's OK not to fit in, and actually, it's OK if you're not cool."" Manson was 28 when she burst out of the Madison, Wisconsin, music scene in 1995 with guitarist Steve Marker, bassist Duke Erikson and drummer Butch Vig. As the man who produced the Smashing Pumpkins' ""Gish"" and Nirvana's ""Nevermind,"" Vig may have had the name, but it was Manson who became the face of Garbage: a flame-haired Scottish vixen who prowled the stage in boots and a minidress, taking ""Stupid Girls"" to task and pouting that she's ""Only Happy When it Rains."" The group's subversive wit and sonic collision of pop, alternative rock and electronica placed them squarely outside the mainstream, yet it was the mainstream that embraced them. Over the course of four CDs, they sold 13 million albums worldwide. But there have been tensions, too. In 2003, the band took a break. The next year, they re-grouped and released another record, only to call it quits in the midst of their ""Bleed Like Me"" world tour of 2005. ""It wasn't the touring that we really had a problem with. It's just unfortunately all the issues that we had culminated whilst we were touring,"" Manson recalled. She blamed many of those problems on their old record company. ""We were an indie band signed to an indie label, and then we got sold as a commodity to a major label that had very little interest in us, and it was a miserable experience for us."" ""Not Your Kind of People"" was released May 15 on the group's own label, Stunvolume. ""Free at last!"" Manson exclaimed. ""We are signing the checks on absolutely everything, which is terrifying, but I think nothing ventured in life that doesn't require a little risk is not worth taking. I think this time around, what is different is that we're not tied to making ridiculous amounts of profit. That's just not what we're interested in, and it's certainly not why we joined a band in the first place."" Manson is now 45. With her signature red hair and creamy complexion, she's as appealing as she was in the mid-'90s. The new record picks up where Garbage left off seven years ago, not veering too far from their meticulously crafted layers of goth-tinged pop-rock. This is a band that knows it sounds different from everyone else, and doesn't care to conform. ""We took some time off. We just felt a little burnt out, if truth be told. And then I guess we just had enough life happen that we felt ready to create again,"" she said. ""I called the band up and said, 'Are you into this?' And they said, 'Yup! We're in. Let's do it.'""","""Not Your Kind of People"" is Garbage's first album in seven years .

"(EW.com) -- Although reincarnation is never discussed in ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" past lives exert a powerful presence in this lulling, happy-face story of retirement-age self-renewal, set in a shimmering, weltering, jewel-colored India. Except in this case, the recycling isn't of souls but of the elements of box office success. So to get the most out of the manufactured ""Marigold"" experience -- or at least to find something to say afterward other than ''Well, that was...cute'' -- it helps first to meditate on the karmic path that has led to this moment in time, and this blending of sanitized ""Slumdog Millionaire"" exoticism with the popular ""Enchanted April"" promise of reinvention abroad. Likewise, to best enjoy this warming tale of seven British pensioners who come to Jaipur for their retirement, it helps to watch the actors in a kind of memory trance that summons up past performances overlaid on the present. While admiring Judi Dench now as a stalwart widow in financial straits after her husband's death, for instance, try summoning up the image of her as the stalwart widow Queen Victoria in Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown. While enjoying the delightful apoplexies of Maggie Smith as an acidic old bat afraid of anything foreign, think of the many great, scenery-chewing variations she has done in recent years since inhabiting the body of Professor Minerva McGonagall throughout the ""Harry Potter"" saga. The star may trot out a working woman's accent here, but it's impossible to tune out the chiming imperiousness of her Dowager Countess of Grantham on ""Downton Abbey."" The Dames are joined by Brit vets Bill Nighy (""Love Actually""), Penelope Wilton (""Downton Abbey""), Tom Wilkinson (""In the Bedroom""), Celia Imrie (""Calendar Girls""), and Ronald Pickup (""Fortunes of War""), each a character in search of a new lease on life and intrigued by the marketing come-on of the title hotel, with its offer of comfy amenities ''for the Elderly and Beautiful.'' 'Bachelorette': Meet the guys! Of course, when they arrive (their dusty white Brit butts bruised by the indignities of Third World travel), the hotel is not exactly as advertised. Phones don't work, not every room has its own door, that sort of thing. On the flip side, the place is run by ""Slumdog Millionaire's"" young, winning Dev Patel, here playing an ambitious fellow named Sonny, so the energy of the place is good. This optimistic business go-getter loves a pretty girl (Tena Desae) who works in one of those outsourced-labor call centers that have invigorated the Indian economy and exasperated U.S. credit-card customers with questions about their accounts. The affinities between outsourced office laborers and outsourced retirees are pointed out as if by an exhaustively thorough tour guide. To be sure, there's something comfortable -- and comforting -- about all this. As directed by John Madden (reunited with Dench after Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown and Shakespeare in Love) from a screenplay by Ol Parker (""Imagine Me and You"") based on a novel by Deborah Moggach, the movie is as reliable as a tea bag. And with no more ""Harry Potters"" in the pipeline and a lull between seasons of ""Downton Abbey,"" it's a pip to see these players be so ... British. Ashton Kutcher 'brownface' ad pulled . The loyal if unhappily married husband (tender-funny Nighy) and his perpetually dissatisfied wife (Wilton) face their marital crossroads; the mournful judge (Wilkinson) attends to a heartache from his past; the fading divorcÃ©e(Imrie) and the decaying swinger (Pickup) each address the sexuality of aging singletons. Smith gets to bite into some tasty lines of dialogue (""If I can't pronounce it, I won't eat it"") and trundle around in a wheelchair (her character has come to India for an economy-priced hip replacement). Everyone learns. Everyone hugs. The soundtrack favors jaunty sitar melodies. The cinematography shows off the overwhelming sensory stimulation of the place while stepping briskly around less-than-colorful images of real poverty, squalor, overcrowding, and despair. As a brand extender (for the senior cast, for the director, and certainly for Patel, following the grand success of ""Slumdog""), ""Marigold Hotel"" achieves what it sets out to do: Sell something safe and sweet, in a vivid foreign setting, to an underserved share of the moviegoing market. The questions we're left to ponder are: What's the karmic consequence of putting profit goals ahead of creative energy? What will the next reincarnation of this kind of movie look like? And who will Maggie Smith play? B- . See full article at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"(Rolling Stone) -- The Sonisphere Knebworth festival, which was to host performances by Kiss, Marilyn Manson and a version of Queen fronted by Adam Lambert, has been cancelled. According to organizers, plans for the event -- which was to be held in Stevenage, England on July 6-8-- were scrapped due to unforeseen difficulties. ""It is with very heavy hearts and much regret that we announce the cancellation of Sonisphere Knebworth 2012,"" reads a statement on the festival's website. ""Putting the festival together in what is proving to be a very challenging year was more difficult than we anticipated. Unfortunately circumstances have dictated that we would be unable to run the festival to a standard that both the artists and that Sonisphere's audience would rightly expect."" Other Sonisphere festivals, including events in Poland, Spain and Swizterland, will go on as planned with Metallica as a headliner. It is unclear how the cancellation of the festival will affect the touring plans of other bands on the bill, which also included Evanescence, Faith No More, Flogging Molly, Mastodon, Andrew W.K., Incubus and the Darkness. The Sonisphere Knebworth festival is the only date scheduled for a Queen performance featuring Lambert. As of yet, neither Lambert or Queen have commented on the possibility of making alternate plans. See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Early one morning the sun was shining and she was lying in bed, wondering why he had her cash and if her hair was still red. An idea for a song bubbled, and she wasn't sure if this one should be about heartbreak, revenge or the old get-into-the-groove thing. And then -- light bulb! -- why not multitask it? That was her therapy, after all. Failure? Not an option. Resistance to her will? Futile. The husband who was no longer there? Well, it was nice sometimes to imagine his head popping like a melon. Till death and all that. Now -- where did she put her phone? Yup, ""MDNA"" is our lady's divorce album. Seven out of 16 songs address her split directly, and that's low-balling if you think the chick with ""fake t*** and a nasty mood"" in ""Some Girls"" could be the lingerie model who became Guy Ritchie's new baby mama. Revealing herself has always been part of her art, and this is hardly her first album that's dark, messy and conflicted. But ""MDNA"" stands as Madonna's most explicit work. Only who would have expected her to be this explicit with her... feelings? How explicit? ""Wake up, ex-wife/This is your life."" ""I tried to be your wife/Diminished myself, I swallowed my light."" ""Lawyers/Suck it up/Didn't have a prenup."" ""Every man that walks through that door will be compared to you for evermore."" She's been personal, but never this detailed before. In part, it's an old punk-rock impulse: Show the world no one can hurt you more than you hurt yourself. Except she has cross-wired exposure and pain, which gives this set of confessions their discomforting immediacy. As the beats swirl, Madonna pursues release, vows to rise above and wishes things had turned out differently. She also sings about new love (fits like a glove), and asks for someone to lick the frosting off her cake on ""B-Day Song."" The music chases the latest articulations of club-land ecstasy, but often returns to the blend of synth-driven electro and Sixties-pop classicism she's staked out since ""Like a Prayer."" Back after a 12-year layoff is William Orbit, who handles the most pained tracks (including ""Gang Bang,"" which b*tch-slaps Ritchie's shoot-'em-up aesthetic with a nod to ""Kill Bill""). New in town is Martin Solveig, the French producer behind the cheerleader fantasy of ""Give Me All Your Luvin'"" who is forced to curb his love of Prince, in service of sounding like William Orbit. Handling the big dance-floor tracks are Italian duo Benny and Alle Benassi, who put the empty boom of the club into songs like ""Girl Gone Wild."" Hooks emerge quickly; there's lots of naughtiness for the DJ to bring back, and the music has depth that rewards repeated listening. The first impression is a desperation most people will mistake for Madonna's old impulse for commercial connection. That's never far away, but this is something far more personal. There's something remarkable about Madonna's decision to share her suffering the way she once shared her pleasure. Her music has always been about liberation from oppression, but for the first time the oppression is internal: loss and sadness. Stars -- they really are just like us.
