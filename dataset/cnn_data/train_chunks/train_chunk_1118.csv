"Popeye's love of spinach is born out of one of history's easiest mathematical errors. A mathematician and scientist has revealed that spinach's iron content was miscalculated by a German chemist when he misplaced a decimal point. His mistake gave birth to Popeye's obsession with the vegetable, which the cartoon character eats in vast quantities to boost his strength. Popeye's testimony that he is 'strong to the finish, 'cause I eats my spinach' is apparently born from a mistake 50 years before he became popular. Erich von Wolf misplaced a decimal point when recording his research, making the iron content in spinach ten times more generous than in reality. This caused the popular misconception that spinach is exceptionally high in iron, which makes the body stronger...a myth that cartoon character Popeye (pictured) helped to spread . Samuel Arbesman talks about how scientific errors can lead to popular myths in his book, 'The Half-life of Facts: Why Everything We Know Has an Expiration Date'. In 1870, German chemist Erich von Wolf was researching the amount of iron in spinach and other green vegetables. When writing up his findings in a new notebook, he misplaced a decimal point, making the iron content in spinach ten times more generous than in reality. While Mr von Wolf actually found out that there are just 3.5 milligrams of iron in a 100g serving of spinach, the accepted number became 35 milligrams thanks to his mistake. This caused the popular misconception that spinach is exceptionally high in iron, which makes the body stronger. If the value was true, eating a generous serving of spinach would be comparable to munching on a small piece of paper clip. The story goes that cartoon creators aware of spinach's miraculous health properties had the idea that Popeye should eat spinach to increase his strength. It is believed that the cartoon character is responsible for boosting consumption of spinach in the US by a third. The incorrect . calculation of spinach's iron content contributed to the creation of popular cartoon character Popeye, according to a book by . mathematician and scientist Samuel Arbesman . While Mr von Wolf's error was spotted and corrected in 1937 when someone re-checked his maths, spinach is still popularly thought to be one of the most iron-rich vegetables, perhaps helped by the cartoon character. In 1981, the British Medical Journal published an article to try and debunk the spinach myth. Mr Arbesman uses the Popeye story to illustrate how humans have a tendency to ignore re-examining evidence and admit when we are wrong. He said that the reason such errors spread and lead to well-believed myths are because it is easier to spread a 'fact' that sounds correct than to delve deeper.

"More than £325million has been spent running plush Ministry of Defence offices while soldiers and their families live in dilapidated homes. Defence chiefs are forking out huge amounts of taxpayers' money on lavish offices with marble and stone floors, a fully-equipped gym, restaurant and coffee bars so civil servants work in comfort. Yet troops must endure ageing barracks with leaking roofs, broken boilers, faulty wiring, cracked windows and damp. Expensive: Refurbishment at the Ministry of Defence in London . The sums spent on making life easy for cosseted desk-bound penpushers will fuel disgruntlement within the hard-pressed Armed Forces. They are revealed at a time of plunging morale among troops - many whom risked their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan - as they struggle to deal with 30,000 redundancies, pay freezes and the axing of perks. The MoD has forked out £285million running its state-of-the-art air-conditioned main office in Whitehall, a prime location next to the River Thames, in just three years. The imposing building houses more than 30,000 civil servants who enjoys subsidised restaurants, cafes and 'relaxation rooms' where staff can take a break. Grand: The Ministry of Defence office in Whitehall . The offices also contain plasma screens, 3,500 oak doors costing £3million and civil servants sit on chairs worth £1,000 each. Ministers paid £746million for the private finance deal, where the Government repays the cost of refurbishment and maintenance over 30 years. But when inflation is taken into account, actual payments over 30 years will be £ 2.35billion. The MoD has also spent £32million running St Georges Court, a small office complex in New Oxford Street, central London, and £6.5million on operating Cromwell House, a Grade 1-listed building in Whitehall Gardens. The figures were uncovered by Parliamentary questions from Labour MP John Mann. The amount of money spent contrasts sharply with the dilapidated military accommodation that troops and their families are forced to endure in Britain and Germany. In 2011, the MoD received more than 400,000 complaints about substandard homes. Most gripes were about damp, mould, leaking roofs and problems with boilers and electricity supplies. Uncovered: John Mann MP discovered the extravagant new expenditure . A survey this year by the RAF Families Federation highlighted how service personnel were still living in crumbling homes. One wife, who declined to be named, told the organisation: 'I have just moved into the worst accommodation I have ever occupied during my marriage. 'Mould, archaic plumbing, broken windows and a concrete garden are all features of my new home. It is situated on a very dilapidated estate. Empty houses surround me, with broken fences, windows and scaffolding propping up condemned housing. It has brought me to tears.' A report by the Commons' Defence Select Committee recently found two-thirds of service accommodation for members of the armed forces without families was rated 'unsatisfactory'. Despite this, the Coalition has halted a £5billion upgrade programme for military housing in a bid to save money. In the Armed Forces own annual survey, published this week, one in three troops said the shabby state of service accommodation increased their desire to quit. And 30 per cent said they were 'dissatisfied' with the standard of military accommodation with 40 per cent claiming they were unhappy at how long it took to get workmen to carry out repairs.","MoD has forked out £285million running its state-of-the-art main office .

The family of 17-year-old Sidney Good of Roanoke confirmed she was released from hospital in Panama City, Florida and flown back to Indianapolis. After extensive surgery to save her life in the wake of the July 1st accident, Good was even well enough to take her first steps on Saturday - to the delight of her parents. Scroll Down for Video . Improvements: Alexis Fairchild (left) was discharged from the Florida hospital on Thursday while Sidney Good is awaiting facial reconstructive surgery . Good and friend Alexis Fairchild, 17, of Huntington were injured after the rope connecting them to a boat snapped and they slammed into a condominium, hit a power line and struck a parked car. Dramatic cellphone footage shows both girls hitting the balcony of the condo as hundreds of beach goers scream out loud as they watch the horrifying accident unfold. On the evening of the accident, both girls underwent brain surgery, but Good continued to suffer brain trauma that stopped doctors from working on her broken neck for several days.

Sidney, left, and Alexis, right: Both girls sustained head trauma as well as multiple severe lacerations . Once that surgery was completed successfully, Good was taken off a ventilator and now doctors are working towards reconstructive surgery on her facial injuries. Good's family released the following statement on Sunday: . 'On Saturday, Sidney Good was able to stand up and walk for the first time since her parasailing accident on July 1 in Panama City Beach,' reads the statement. 'She walked just a short distance to a chair where she was able to sit up to eat.  Over the past few days she has been talking with us more and memories of the day of the accident are coming back. 'Sunday morning, Sidney was released from Bay Medical Center and flown to Indianapolis for further evaluation and possibly more surgery. 'She is not yet ready for a rehabilitation hospital and will not be at the same hospital as Alexis, but we look forward to getting them together again sometime soon.'

'I really don't know how long she's going to be here, but I feel like she's in good hands here,' Fairchild said. Doctors are doing assessments to see what Fairchild's capabilities are and what her immediate and long-term needs may be. 'She's going to be working very hard for us,' said Lisa Lombard, RHI's medical director. Fairchild's father said she has not talked much about what she has been through.

"An award-winning food firm has been slapped with £18,000 legal costs after it was caught cooking meals for primary children in shocking conditions. Environmental health officers visited Food 4 Thought GB Ltd’s premises in Boston, Lincolnshire, on October 4 last year after a tip off from a concerned school. And they were stunned when they found filthy conditions in the unit where children’s meals were being prepared. As well as mould-stained chopping boards, council officers found dirty cups, plastic bowls and colanders. Mess: The inside of a freezer at Food 4 Thought GB, a firm that provides food for schoolchildren. It has been fined more than £18,000 because of the shocking level of hygeine . A mouldy chopping board at the site in Boston, Lincolnshire . The filthy premises also had grimy floors, walls and cleaning cloths as well as flaking paint and inadequate food labelling. Health bosses also discovered raw meat being stored next to cooked ready-to-eat ham. Food 4 Thought GB Ltd admitted 12 different food hygiene charges when company directors Caroline Clark and Moira Clark appeared at Boston Magistrates Court on Monday. The company, which supplied 750,000 meals-a-year to 75 schools in Lincolnshire, was fined £13,800 and ordered to pay £4,300 costs as well as a victim surcharge of £130. Magistrates said they were surprised that someone with even a basic knowledge of food hygiene had not identified issues before the visit. After the case councillor Malcolm Chandler, South Holland District Council’s portfolio holder for environmental health, said: 'Officers from our food, health and safety team take seriously their responsibilities in protecting the public and ensuring good standards of food hygiene are maintained. 'We work very closely with businesses to raise and maintain standards. We work in partnership with neighbouring authorities and agencies to ensure that geographical boundaries are not an obstacle.' Food 4 Thought GB Ltd admitted 12 different food hygiene charges when company directors Caroline Clark and Moira Clark appeared at Boston Magistrates Court on Monday . He added: 'The business in question supplies a number of school meals within South Holland District Council’s area and I believe the public, and in particular parents, will be assured by the action taken.' Food 4 Thought GB Ltd - which has eight sites across Lincolnshire - has operated as a school meals supplier since 2006 having previously been called Hungry Monkeys UK Ltd. The company displays a Lincolnshire Small and Medium Business of the Year award on the wall of its new offices in Spalding, Lincolnshire, and won ‘Contribution to the Community’ award in Boston last year. After the case Mrs Clark admitted their standards had slipped but insisted it was a 'one-off'. She added: 'We remain committed to food hygiene in our operation, as our case mentioned we admitted that at the time standards did fall below those which we and the local authority endeavour to keep to only the highest levels.' 'We would like to reassure our customers that the findings are not of recent visits to the site, but a single one-off historic visit. Magistrates said they were surprised that someone with even a basic knowledge of food hygiene had not identified issues before the visit . 'Upon receiving the report, for which this prosecution started from, some six months ago, we immediately re-recruited our management team and gave further training to the area manager. 'We are confident that following our senior management actions, the site immediately reverted to the highest of standards, as evidenced in our last official star rating of 5/5. 'However, we have also requested another visit from the district, as soon as possible, so that following the court hearing, we can again evidence our commitment to food hygiene.' On their website Food 4 Thought GB Ltd described themselves as 'Lincolnshire’s fastest growing provider of school meals, supplying thousands of healthy school meals each week'. They add: 'Here you will see how our award winning company succeeds in increasing take up of school lunches, by providing only the best quality, freshly prepared, child friendly meals. 'As specialists in the education sector, we devote all of our efforts into ensuring our customers, children, parents and schools, are happy with the service we provide, and have evidenced a whopping 300 per cent increase in take up since the introduction of our services in our flagship schools.'","Food 4 Thought GB was investigated following tip-off from a school .

"A motorist said today that his car was wrecked when his electronic cigarette exploded while charging. Chris Thomas, 37, said the e-cigarette shot out of the 12V power socket 'like a firework' and landed on the back seat of his Skoda company car, setting setting fire to the upholstery. Flames destroyed the rear seat and a child seat, scorched the front headrests and visors and left all the windows badly smoke blackened. Burnt out: Chris Thomas says his car seat was destroyed when his e-cigarette exploded while charging up . The father of one, 37, from Maesycwmmer in south Wales, with the e-cigarette he says set fire to his car . Father of three Mr Thomas, from Maesycwmmer, South Wales, says he had left the £29.99 device charging overnight in the 12V power socket of his company-owned Skoda Superb. The vehicle engineer said: 'The car alarm went off in the early hours of the morning so I went out and saw there was no-one around and clicked it off and went back to bed. 'I got up about an hour later for work and when I went out to the car I found everything burnt out. 'The cigarette had been charging in the front point and it's as if it went off like a firework. Even the front visors are burnt through. 'I can't believe what happened. When I told my partner she was shocked. What if it was in the house charging and had gone off inside? Ruined: The windows of the car were completely blackened by the explosion which happened overnight . 'God knows what would have happened then, or if it had gone off when we were driving and I've got children inside the car.' Mr Thomas, from Maesycwmmer, South Wales, has not been told how much it will cost to repair the damage to the year-old estate car but the bill could run into thousands. He started smoking e-cigarettes four months ago in an attempt to kick his 40-a-day habit. One of 1.3m Britons who have taken up the devices in recent years, Mr Thomas chose a Vapouriz Tank which is topped up using a liquid. The firm's website warns users not to leave the cigarettes unattended as they charge up, which can take around four hours. Astonishing damage: The £29.99 Vaporiz Tank is one of the more expensive e-cigarettes on the market . Mr Thomas, who said he'd tried two cheaper alternatives before but they both blew up a USB drive, said he was now planning to give up the tobacco alternative altogether. He added: 'I used to be a heavy smoker but I've not touched a cigarette for four months since I tried these. 'I know a lot of people who smoke and I've told them about the electronic cigarette. The product is excellent, but the thought of it blowing up is terrifying. 'It is supposed to be the best in the market so what are the cheaper ones like? The whole situation has scared me. 'They are meant to be the saviour but when you see the see the state of the car it makes you wonder what chemicals are inside them.  I want people to realise they can be dangerous.' A spokesman for Vapouriz, which offers advice on charging the devices on its website, said: 'Chris Thomas has not contacted us with regards to any complaint, and actually purchased ‘e-liquid’, which in its diluted form is not flammable, from us only four days ago. 'Mr Thomas, having used three different brands of e-cigarettes over a four-month period, has allegedly  had each one ‘blow up’ – this leads me to think that he may be using wrong or unsuitable chargers.' The spokesman said: 'We do warn users not to leave the cigarettes unattended as they charge up, so this does not mean you should leave them in your car overnight.' As e-cigarettes have grown in popularity there have been an increasing number of incidents concerning their safety. Three-year-old Khonor Barlow was burnt when his mother's e-cigarette exploded as they drove in Utah . A three-year-old boy in America suffered burns when his mother's e-cigarette exploded while charging last week. Khonor Barlow was burnt after his mother's White Rhino device bounced off her car's ceiling and onto the boy as he sat in a car seat in the back as they drove in their hometown of Mount Pleasant, Utah. An electronic cigarette (or e-cigarette), personal vaporiser (PV), or electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) is an electronic inhaler meant to simulate and substitute for tobacco smoking. It uses a heating element that vaporises a liquid solution and some release nicotine, while others merely release flavoured vapour. They are as effective as nicotine patches for helping smokers to quit, according to a recent University of Auckland study. E-cigarettes are currently used by millions of people around the world as a replacement for real cigarettes . Laws vary widely concerning their use and sale, and are the subject of pending legislation and ongoing debate. In theory they can be used anywhere: planes, hospitals or restaurants, but some companies are banning them on varying grounds, perhaps because they bother other people. One French study claims they contain carcinogenic chemicals that make some as harmful as normal tobacco. They are used by more than 3.5m Americans and 1.5m people in the UK. Big tobacco has jumped en masse into the e-cigarette market and all the major cigarette makers now make them. As they've grown in popularity there have been several reports of e-cigarettes exploding due to the lithium-ion batteries inside them becoming overheated .","Chris Thomas says his £29.99 Vapouriz Tank blew up as it charged in car .

"The owner of an English vineyard who crashed his sports car after getting 'tipsy' at a wine tasting is being sued for £300,000 by his injured former girlfriend. Wine entrepreneur Art Tukker, 24, is one of the most influential people in the British wine industry as the owner of the Tinwood Estate vineyard, near Chichester in Sussex. Having consumed a 'significant amount of alcohol' at a 5 hour wine tasting at Millbank Tower in London on March 8 2010, Tukker crashed his two-seater TVR convertible on the A286 driving home in West Sussex. Jetset: Lucinda Stevens, left, with her ex-boyfriend vineyard owner Art Tukker on a skiing holiday together. She is now suing him after his drink driving caused a car crash in which she says she was seriously injured . His ex-girlfriend, 26-year-old wine business graduate Lucinda Fleur Stevens from Chichester, had to be cut from the wreckage of the overturned sports car by firemen. She told the court that she sustained a fractured neck and back, broken ribs and a smashed and dislocated breast bone, while Tukker escaped unharmed. Stevens is suing Tukker for a minimum of £300,000, blaming the winemaker's decision to drink-drive for the 'serious injuries' she suffered. However, the young vineyard boss is fighting the case, claiming his girlfriend 'exposed herself to a . foreseeable risk of injury' by getting in the sports car when she 'knew . that he had been drinking alcohol.' Tukker . is said to have lost control while driving between Haslemere station . and his vineyard. His lawyers admit that the accident . was caused by the viticulturalist's drink driving and he pleaded to . guilty to driving when he was over the limit. However, in his Tukker's defence, Roger . Harris, Mr Tukker's barrister, argued that her 'injuries, loss and . damage were contributed to by her own negligence' because she decided to . travel with him in the knowledge he had been drinking that afternoon. Boutique vineyard: Art Tukker's website for his Tinwood Estate wines . Harris argued that Stevens was aware that Mr Tukker may have been unfit to drive. Art Tukker has been growing three different grape varieties since 2007 at his vineyard, The Tinwood Estate, on the edge of the South Downs national park in West Sussex. Tukker's estate grows . Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, the grapes used to make . Champagne. He makes his own wine and supplies grapes to winemakers Ridgeview to make their 'world class English sparkling wine.' Ridgeview provided the wine served at the recent state banquet for President Obama in 2010. Tukker describes his own brand of wine as having 'aromas of citrus melon fruits with hints of toast and honey.' He said: 'Miss Stevens knew that, during the course of the tasting, Mr Tukker had, or was likely to have, consumed a significant amount of alcohol. 'Miss Stevens and Mr Tukker had dinner together and had then travelled together to Haslemere station by train. Mr Tukker appeared 'tipsy' following the wine tasting.' Therefore Mr Tukker's lawyer claimed that Stevens had 'exposed herself to a forseeable risk of injury,' he claims. Addressing the extent of the injuries Miss Stevens suffered and the value of her claim, the barrister says: 'It is admitted that Miss Stevens suffered some injury in the accident. However no admissions are made as to the extent of any injuries suffered.' On a blog about his career, Mr Tukker wrote that, when he decided to study viticulture: 'I thought I was being extremely clever by doing something where I would get the chance to drink, all in the name of 'education''. He added that the 'best part' of his job is sampling fine wines. An earlier version of this article included a photograph purporting to be of Lucinda Stevens. In fact, the photograph was of a woman who is completely unrelated to this case. We apologise for the error.","Winemaker and his girlfriend had been at a London wine tasting since 11am .

"Southampton will welcome back a number of familiar faces when Liverpool arrive next weekend for a match Nathaniel Clyne believes could prove vital in the top-four race. During last summer's unparalleled talent drain, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert all left St Mary's in favour of a move to Anfield. Those exits came at a reported combined cost of £49million and compounded the departures of head coach Mauricio Pochettino, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw. Nathaniel Clyne is confident Southampton can beat top-four rivals Liverpool at St Mary's a week on Sunday . The England full back helped Saints keep their 12th clean sheet of the season against West Ham . Saints, though, have confounded those expecting them to struggle, with Ronald Koeman's men sitting fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings with 13 matches remaining. Liverpool, four points worse off in seventh, are next up and England right-back Clyne is well aware of the importance of overcoming his former team-mates. 'It is another game we're looking forward to playing,' he said. 'We know Liverpool are a good side. 'It is going to be another tough test for us, but I am sure if we play like we did (against West Ham) we can go and get the three points we're looking for.' Ronald Koeman's high-flying Saints have defied the odds by remaining in the top-four with 13 games to play . Put to Clyne that the match looked important in the top-four battle, he said: 'Yeah, definitely. 'I mean, if we get the win then we can push for that top four and hopefully we can stay there for the rest of the season.' To overcome Liverpool, Saints will need to show a cutting edge that has been missing in recent games at St Mary's. Koeman's side have not won in four successive home matches in all competitions, with the 10 men of West Ham the latest to leave with a smile on their face. Clyne believes Southampton have found it difficult to break teams down at home because teams defend deep . 'I think teams are coming up against us and making it really difficult for us to play,' Clyne said after Wednesday's goalless draw. 'I think they are coming to play counter-attacking football, which means that we have to try and break them down. 'Yeah, it makes it difficult but we're up for the challenge.' Southampton have certainly proved up to the challenge defensively, with their record of 12 clean sheets and just 17 goals conceded the best in the Premier League. The right back makes an acrobatic attempt to clear the ball during the draw with Southampton . 'I think we've been solid all season, really,' Clyne added. 'We've got the best defensive record in the Premier League. 'We know if we keep that up, we know we can always go and win the game. 'It's been a great season. No one expected us to be where we are at the moment, but we're flying high at the moment. 'The confidence in the team and the morale's high and we're playing good football and we're looking good.'","Southampton welcome Liverpool to St Mary's a week on Sunday .

"Lee Tomlin would be the first to admit he has gone dangerously close to blowing his career. The Middlesbrough forward had a rather poor attitude and was kicked out of Leicester City — he was even sent out on loan by Rushden and Diamonds. ‘I was playing for Brackley Town with team-mates who were carpenters and police officers,’ he says. ‘At that stage I did think it was over.’ Lee Tomlin's career almost ended before it had began due to his bad attitude and taste for fast food . The talented forward turned his life around at Peterborough (left) and secured a move to Middlesbrough . He quit football after being released by Leicester, albeit only for a few months. And a minor brush with the law, for celebrating promotion with Peterborough a little too enthusiastically, did not enhance his chances of fulfilling his potential. Nor did a taste for fast food that saw him balloon in weight. Yet here he is in the hotel next to Middlesbrough’s training ground, slim and athletic and talking as candidly about his past as he does passionately about his future. Talking in a way that left me thinking he might be the hungriest footballer I’ve encountered. He seems driven by a fear, having already wasted opportunities, of not now making it big. When he came up against Manchester City in the FA Cup last month, his biggest game to date, he was awestruck at first. ‘I was looking at Silva and Aguero and thinking, “What’s someone like me doing on a pitch with players like that?” It was unbelievable. The 26-year-old is hungry to succeed after almost wasting his chance to make it in the big time . ‘While you’re on the pitch you have to concentrate on your job. I was marking James Milner but I kept finding myself watching David Silva. I was looking at his positioning and trying to learn what’s required to get to the top.’ He learned fast. The 26-year-old was the outstanding player in a match Boro won in style. His manager, Aitor Karanka, pulled him to one side at the end. ‘Now do you believe you can play at this level?’ he asked. Karanka considers Tomlin, a natural No 10 with two great feet and a burst of pace, as the finest player in the Championship, a view endorsed by the recent player-of-the-month award. But the journey to this point has been a difficult one. Tomlin's path from a tough Leicester estate to Championship star has been a difficult one . Liverpool offered him a trial 10 years ago, but he is still waiting to hear how he did. Some members of his extended family are Travellers but he grew up in a council house in a tough neighbourhood in Leicester. His parents split when he was two and he can’t recall meeting his father, who is now deceased. His mother re-married and Tomlin has a lot of time for the long-distance lorry driver who became his stepfather and supported them by doing night shifts. But he did struggle with authority figures in football. Tomlin was seven when he first started at Leicester and for two years his older brother would escort him to and from training. But from nine, with his brother drawn to the usual teenage distractions, Tomlin commuted alone. Tomlin talks to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton near Middlesbrough's training ground in Darlington . ‘It wasn’t the best part of town to grow up in,’ he says. ‘I’m not saying it was an excuse but you had to look after yourself. It wasn’t somewhere you’d necessarily want to bring your kids up. I struggled to take criticism from the coaches. I’d take it personally and answer back. ‘I didn’t like being told what to do. My attitude was poor. I never did anything terrible. I’ve always been someone who would be first in the training ground and last out but I’d mess around. ‘I wouldn’t work as hard as I needed to. Because of the ability I had I didn’t think I needed to. But by the time I was 15, Leicester — the club I’d always dreamed of playing for — had let me go.’ He ‘gave up football’ for a while after that. ‘But I then came to realise that football was the best chance I had. I wasn’t great at school!’ He phoned three clubs: Rushden and Diamonds, Northampton Town and Kettering Town. Rushden offered him a trial and at 16 he made his first-team debut, playing well enough to secure that week-long trial at Liverpool. Tomlin was awestruck at first while playing during Middlesbrough's win over Manchester City in the FA Cup . ‘They put me in digs and I did well in a reserve game against Birmingham,’ he says. ‘I remember being at Melwood and watching the first team train. Seeing players like Gerrard and thinking, “This is amazing”. But I went back to Rushden and never heard a thing.’ By the time he was 21 he secured a move to Peterborough and it was Darren Ferguson who finally started to get through to him. Particularly when it came to his diet. ‘He got me right head-wise,’ he says. The two remain friends even if Tomlin was unhappy when Ferguson refused to sell him to Celtic 18 months ago. ‘Celtic were bidding for me during a game and I thought I was about to join a club that had been drawn against Barcelona, AC Milan and Ajax in the Champions League,’ he says. ‘But he wouldn’t let me go because it was so late in the window, and I accused him of denying me the chance to provide for my family. I was sent off in three of the next four games!’ And now Tomlin is excited by the prospect of testing himself against star-studded Arsenal . He was sent off when Middlesbrough’s scouts went to watch him against Oldham but Karanka signed him and the Spaniard has also been a hugely positive influence. ‘People would see me and think I didn’t even look like a footballer in the past,’ he says. ‘But I’ve lost a stone and a half since I came to Boro. I’ve been doing things right for the last two years, eating right, working hard. I can still be a joker but I know when it’s time to work and when it’s time to have fun.’ He is focused on gaining promotion with a Boro side top of the Championship. Focused also on another chance to test himself against players he hopes to face regularly. It is Arsenal on Sunday in the FA Cup. ‘Sanchez, Cazorla and Ozil,’ he says with excitement. ‘They’re my kind of players.’ He performed to their level against City, nearly scoring what would have been a wonderful goal when a startling piece of skill was followed by a shot on the turn that rattled a post. ‘I thought, “That’s just my luck”,’ he says. ‘I was up against the best centre half in the world (Vincent Kompany) and it would’ve been great if that had gone in. ‘Arsenal is another chance to show what I can do.’ And another step, he hopes, towards becoming a Premier League player and the security he now seeks for his young family: his partner and their two young boys. ‘I want to be able to provide a better life for my family,’ he says. ‘And I want to get my mum out of that council house.’","Lee Tomlin was rejected as a teenager by Leicester City and Liverpool .

"Analysts argue that, manic depression was behind the performances in many of Robin Wiilliams' movies . Madcap antics may be part of a comedian’s on-stage persona. But the madness may not be just an act, say researchers. The ability to make people laugh comes from a personality of the kind displayed by those with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Historically, the creativity of painters and playwrights has been linked to madness, but now British experts have found a link with comedians. High levels of psychotic personality traits are behind the ‘sad clown’ façade of comedians like Spike Milligan, who suffered manic-depressive episodes all his life. Researchers from Oxford University and Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust say manic thinking helps join together ridiculous ideas that spark humour. The stand-ups of a modern era are likely to have greater levels of extraversion – a form of impulsiveness – yet be more depressive and unsociable at the same time. Insane: Spike Milligan suffered years of paralysing manic depression. One of his psychiatrists judged him to be 'certifiably insane' and 'a possible danger to others' In fact, say the researchers, making people laugh may be a form of self-medication to alleviate a low mood. Analysts say Robin Williams suffered from bipolar disorder though they cannot support it with enough evidence. They argue that, manic depression was behind the performances in many of his movies. Williams will throw away the script and act out his heart. He was almost always the comedian in the movies, making fun of serious life issues. One writer suggested that Robin suffered depression when he broke up with one of his former girlfriends and that, it affected his stage performances. Another suggested Williams was depressed when he was dropped from Julliard. Professor Gordon Claridge, of the . University of Oxford, who led the study, said: ‘Although schizophrenic . psychosis itself can be detrimental to humour, in its lesser form it can . increase people’s ability to associate odd or unusual things or to . think ‘outside the box’. ‘Equally, manic thinking, which is . common in people with bipolar disorder, may help people combine ideas to . form new, original and humorous connections.’ Prof . Claridge, with colleagues Victoria Ando and Ken Clark, persuaded 523 . comedians – 404 men and 119 women – to take part in their study. Dave Chappelle: His off-the-wall comedy isn't for everyone. He has been described as having meltdowns on occasion and even took a break from comedy for a while .

"Ronny Deila believes Celtic may never again sign a first-team player from the English top flight due to the unprecedented sums of money flooding into the Barclays Premier League. The game south of the Border was further enriched this week with news of a three-year deal worth over £5bn being brokered with Sky and BT from 2016-17. With the Scottish game earning around £15m per season from broadcasters, the huge disparity in resources between clubs like Burnley and Celtic is widening. Ronny Deila has revealed he struggles to compete against Premier League clubs for signings . Deila insisted that he found some English games ‘boring’ in comparison to what’s going on in Scotland but he realises that the days when his club plundered the likes of Chelsea for Chris Sutton are unlikely to be witnessed again. ‘There are two ways to get players. One, they are Scottish and they want to come back and play for Celtic or other teams in Scotland. Or two, they are young and need to play,’ Deila said. ‘But if they are an established player at Chelsea there are grades where they will go, and we are not even the next one down. They will go to somewhere like Southampton, maybe then West Bromwich Albion and then even the Championship, because the money there is much better than at Celtic.’ Asked if there was any point in now deploying scouts to watch first-team games at the top end of the English game, Deila replied: ‘Yes, for the youngsters. But Willian, Costa … I don’t think they will come. ‘There has to be a special reason — maybe players between the ages of 15 and 25 and again they have to have some relation to Celtic. ‘Maybe they are Irish, someone who loves Celtic and has a dream to play for Celtic. We need to bring up our own and then they go out, and we bring them back again. That is possible I think.’ Deila, pictured with Celtic captain Scott Brown, insists Championship sides can even beat his side to signings . Intimidating though the latest TV deal down south is, Deila maintains it only has limited relevance for Scottish football. England may virtually be a no-go area now as far as signing ready-made talents is concerned but the Norwegian sees no barriers to Scottish clubs rearing their own. Martin Odegaard, who played for Deila at Stromgodset aged 15, has just joined Real Madrid and the Celtic manager feels there could be other such talents within Scotland. ‘Martin Odegaard is a once in every 10 years players in Europe. I have seen very good players but he is very special at that level,’ he added. ‘But Messi can come from Scotland if you believe in it. You have to develop him like Messi and that is not about results. It is about making him into a complete football player. ‘If I tell my players they have to give the ball back to the midfield because they can’t take the ball with their back to the goal then they will never play for a Liverpool or whatever. Real Madrid were able to entice Norway international Martin Odegaard to the Santiago Bernabeu in January . ‘You should never give young players boundaries. I have told my first-team players if they make a mistake with a pass I couldn’t care less. ‘As long as you work hard, mistakes will happen. If they make a mistake I will never have a go at them because they have to have freedom on the pitch so they learn.’ Despite being financially hamstrung, Deila feels there is much to commend the Scottish game for compared with much of what he’s witnessed in England. ‘Scottish football has so much enthusiasm,’ he added. ‘I don’t think too much about money. It is important for fans to understand the English clubs are getting more money and we have no chance to compete with budgets. But we can be better at other things that doesn’t cost money like developing players and people. ‘I think we should be more proud of it (the game in Scotland). The interest here is phenomenal. It is something special. ‘When you go to Celtic games away, the fans are fantastic. ‘I have been many times to England and I am bored compared with what’s happening here in the stands sometimes. ‘The game against Rangers is special. They don’t have that. ‘I have been at United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham and it’s not near the atmosphere there was in that game.’ Deila has said the atmosphere at the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal does not rival the Old Firm derby .","Celtic boss Ronny Deila has admitted he struggles in the transfer market .

"Laura Robson appears set to shelve plans to make her comeback next week at a low-key event in Arizona. The former British No 1, whose last appearance came more than 12 months ago at the Australian Open, had been considering a return at a $25,000 lower-tier tournament at a place called Surprise starting next Monday. Her agent, Max Eisenbud, was quoted in Melbourne last month as pinpointing this as her comeback schedule ahead of making a return to the full WTA Tour at the much higher profile Indian Wells event in early March. Laura Robson is not likely to appear in the lower-tier Surprise, Arizona, tournament as initially planned . However, informed sources say that, while there has not been any major setback in her rehabilitation, her wrist is still not ready for the rigours of full-on competition. The 21-year-old former British No 1 is adamant she won't rush back from a long-suffered wrist injury . While Eisenbud was not responding to inquiries, it is also suggested that it is far from certain that she will play at Indian Wells or the Miami Open that follows it later next month. Robson was struggling with wrist problems from late 2013 onwards and in late April of 2014 underwent surgery, putting her in a cast for the rest of the summer. She was able to return to training and practice later on last year, working mostly in Florida, but as with all wrist injuries in tennis it has proved a torturously long process, and the watchword has always been caution. Former US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro is the most prominent example of this and has been plagued by issues off and on for nearly four years, having undergone surgery on both wrists. He played at the ATP event in Sydney last month but then had to pull out of the Australian Open, and has subsequently had another minor procedure done on his left wrist. Although she has found the hiatus in her career immensely frustrating, Robson is adamant that she will not be rushing back until she feels absolutely ready, although she is said to be doing plenty of hitting. A clue to her immediate plans could be found in a reply on her ever-lively Twitter feed, which said she planned to go and see 50 Shades of Grey this weekend. Robson's endured a frustrating recovery and hasn't competed since last year's Australian Open .","Laura Robson was due to return to action at event in Surprise, Arizona .

"As Kim Jong Un threatens to attack the US, the North Koreans may be about to pull their ambassador out of London. A sign outside the pariah state's embassy - an ordinary home in west London - says they will be 'loading' on Tuesday morning. Despite North Korea warning that the safety of foreigners in their country 'cannot be guaranteed' beyond next Wednesday, the Foreign Office are refusing to pull their man out of Pyongyang. Getting out? A sign outside the North Korean embassy suggests the ambassador could be quitting London - as there will be 'loading' on Tuesday morning . Quitting London? The seven-bedroom ordinary home that is the North Korean embassy where ambassador Hyon Hak Bong lives . Although Britain are staying put, a sign pinned to a tree outside the oppressive regime's base in Ealing suggests ambassador Hyon Hak Bong may be about to retreat. It said: 'Advance notice. Please do not park here during the following period when loading work will take place. Thanks for your cooperation.' Tonight a man who answered the phone at the embassy in Gunnersbury Avenue claimed they had no plans to quit Britain. When asked why the sign was there, he responded: 'One guy, a secretary is leaving the country at the end of his term. He asked for a van to carry all of his belongings. 'There is a new secretary coming soon.' He refused to give the name of the old secretary or say who the replacement will be. Honour: Hyon Hak Bong, the North Korean ambassador, presents his credentials to the Queen in a private audience at Buckingham Palace last year . Pressed on whether they were leaving, the official said 'no' and added 'The embassy is open every day. Call back tomorrow. There is no one here now.' When the MailOnline asked the man on the phone to identify himself he hung up. While other ambassadors get to live in some of Britain's most expensive properties near Hyde Park, North Korean Mr Bong has to put up with a modest 1920s home. The seven-bedroom property, down the road from where Carry On star Sid James lived, has been home to the pariah state since 2003. Demonstrators regularly gather outside the ordinary property which stands out only because of the 40ft flagpole in the garden. It was business as usual at the property on Friday when Mr Bong's wife was seen going out shopping. Contrast: While the North Korean ambassador is forced to make do with a semi-detached home - this is the Finnish embassy near Hyde Park . Although they keep the blinds drawn down, neighbours said they were nice people. One said: ‘We had some of the diplomats round for a drink . once,’ he said. ‘They told us they love England. ‘But I suppose that’s no surprise coming from North Korea, is it? One of them said he was a big fan of The X Factor.’ Amid mounting tensions, Foreign Secretary William Hague today insisted Britain 'should be concerned' about North Korea's activities. He said the 'danger of miscalculation' by Kim Jong-un's regime, which had worked itself up into a 'frenetic state of rhetoric', must be considered. Pyongyang comes to London: Website for the North Korean embassy in London - which is an ordinary semi-detached home in Ealing . Threats: Dictator Kim Jong-Un, pictured here pointing a pistol, has repeatedly threatened to attack South Korea and the US . But he insisted it was vital the international community remained calm and stressed there were no signs that North Korea was beginning to re-position its forces ready for war. Speaking on BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hague said: 'There's a threat to the world from any country breaching the non-proliferation treaty, which North Korea is doing, acting in contravention of a whole series of UN Security Council resolutions and setting out to develop more and more longer range weapons, testing new nuclear weapons and indulging in the proliferation of many items to other countries as well. 'We should be concerned about that. There is a danger in that. 'But it is important to stress that we haven't seen in recent days, in recent weeks, a change in what is happening in North Korean society. We have not been able to observe that. We've haven't seen the repositioning of forces or the redeployment of ground forces that one might see in a period prior to a military assault or to an all out conflict.'Mr Hague declined to speculate on whether the 29-year-old dictator was 'nuts'.","North Korean embassy deny they are quitting Britain and claim a removals van is coming for a secretary on Tuesday .

"Theft: Jennifer Colenso stole from collection boxes that were dropped off at her home for cash to be counted . A volunteer treasurer who stole nearly £100,000 from an animal charity was today told her crimes were so serious that she faces jail. While looking after the accounts for North Devon Animal Ambulance Jennifer Colenso wrote out cheques to her own accountancy consultancy firm. The 69-year-old also stole cash from the charity’s collection boxes after they were dropped off at her home for the money to be counted. At an earlier hearing Colenso, who has worked as an accountant for 50 years, pleaded guilty to eight charges of fraud and one of theft. Judge Phillip Wassall was due to sentence the accountant, of West Yelland, Barnstaple, Devon, today but granted her bail to put her affairs in order. 'The seriousness of the offending here outweighs any mitigation,' Judge Wassall told the court. 'Despite the obvious and strong points of mitigation I can not avoid a custodial sentence. 'I am going to grant you bail to put your affairs in order before I impose the sentence that I must.' White-haired Colenso, who will be 70 in a few months’ time, was surrounded by friends and family as she entered Exeter Crown Court. The court heard she stole the money from the voluntary animal rescue service that is set up to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home domestic and wild animals. Colenso looked after the accounts for the charity that has a number of shops and hundreds of regular financial donors. The court heard she took the money between October 2009 and November 2010 but has since paid back the sum of over £99,000. No other choice: Exeter Crown Court, where Colenso was told her crimes were so serious that a jail sentence would be unavoidable . The fraud came to light after other members of the charity questioned Colenso over what had happened to some legacy funds which were supposed to be put into a charity bond. The charity then hired an accounting investigator to analyse the charity’s books and were shocked by what they found when he unearthed the thefts. Alex Allsop, prosecuting, said: 'This is a case of a serious fraud, committed against the North Devon Animal Ambulance charity.' He said Colenso wrote five cheques to the total value of £45,690.90 made payable to Colenso & Co. The cheques were supposed to have been made out to Market Vets. Further cheques of £14,000 and £12,499 were used to pay Colenso’s VAT and PAYE bills to HM Revenue and Customs. On top of this Colenso, who was also the treasurer of North Devon Yacht Club, made out a cheque to the sum of £23,634 to pay solar panel company Dulas for work due to be carried out on the roof of the club. Finally the court heard she admitted stealing £3,652 in cash from the charity boxes the public had made donations to. Mr Allsop told the court the money amounted to a sum of £99,476.67. 'There is no doubt there was an enormous amount of trust placed on the defendant,' the prosecutor said. Firm: Judge Phillip Wassall said that 'strong points of mitigation' would not be enough to keep Colenso out of jail . In an impact statement from an unnamed charity trustee, the court heard they had felt 'horrendously let down by Mrs Colenso' and there had been a 'complete state of shock, disbelief and panic' when they found out about the fraud. But in mitigation Richard Crabb told the court his client had paid back all of the money she had stolen - raised through an equity release scheme on her marital home. He added Colenso had suffered a stroke followed by a mini stroke and was the sole carer of her husband who uses a wheelchair after he was left paraplegic following a 'freak incident'. Mr Crabb said: 'I apologise on her behalf for the losses and upset caused by her conduct over 12 months. 'Her behaviour was inexcusable and resulted in a loss to the charity of about £100,000. 'The problem seems to have been that Mrs Colenso took on this work at a bad time in her life. She took it on without fully understanding the full extent of the work involved. 'There was a combination of health problems, that led to business problems and responsibilities at home causing increased worry and clouded judgement. She wasn’t herself and there was an element of denial. 'She was simply in a bad place and it was totally out of character. She is certainly well regarded both professionally and privately within the local community.' Despite asking the judge to consider his client’s age, previous good character, and the fact the money had been paid back to the charity, Judge Wassall said a custodial sentence was unavoidable. The charity is also looking for a sum of £19,000 to be paid in compensation for the investigative work done by the independent accountant. Colenso was granted unconditional bail and told to return to court on May 3 when she will be sentenced. Nobody from the charity was at the court hearing today.

"The Miracle Baby of Pan Am Flight 759 is now 33, a mother herself, and has spoken out about the 1982 tragedy following its recent anniversary. Melissa 'Missy' Trahan was 16 months old when she was found amidst the rubble left when a 727 was smashed into a Kenner, Louisiana neighborhood by a weather anomaly 32 years ago this past July 9. Trahan's mother and 4-year-old sister were among the 8 victims killed on the ground when the Las Vegas-bound flight went down just after takeoff. Missy Trahan was once famously dubbed the Miracle Baby of Pan Am Flight 759, which killed 146 people on board and eight in the neighborhood it all but razed in 1982, before she was pulled out from under debris with only minor burns at 16-months-old . Horrific: Pan Am Flight 759 went down due to a severe microburst one minute after take-off. The plane razed six homes in Kenner and ruined countless lives, but Trahan has managed to thrive . Unbelievable: Fifteen homes were obliterated or damaged by the massive commercial aircraft as it ripped through a Kenner neighborhood . Now a mother herself, Trahan tells the New Orleans Times-Picayune she's moved on but not forgotten her beginnings as the Pan Am Miracle Baby. 'I was so fortunate to be surrounded by a loving family, including my grandparents from both sides,' she told the Times-Picayune. Trahan grabbed national headlines after she was pulled from under some debris with just superficial burns following the horrific crash. The plane razed six houses as it went down and destroyed countless lives in Kenner. All 146 people on board also perished. Tribute: Trahan lost her mother and 4-year-old sister in the horrific crash but is now the mother of her own 4-year-old daughter, Melanie, who is named after Trahan's mother . Facing fears: Trahan left Kenner behind when her father took her from the town that harbored so many ghosts for them following the crash. However, she's now back in New Orleans and thriving . Staying strong: Trahan even spoke to and comforted loved ones of victims of the terrible accident at a 2012 memorial commemorating the tragedy's 30th anniversary . Trahan and her father picked up and moved out of Kenner and for years she lived her life away from the New Orleans area including a stint working in Orlando. But Crescent City eventually called her back despite the ghosts from her past. In 2010 she married her 'boy next door' Joe Ferrera. The happy couple now have a 4-year-old daughter named after Trahan's late mother, Melanie. 'I've been given something that nobody else has,' Trahan told WWLTV. 'I was given a second chance.' Authorities at the scene had to create a makeshift morgue at the crash site and the emotional scars left by Flight 759 continued to linger long after the neighborhood was restored . Despite the line of strong storms coming through, the plane was cleared for take off from Louis Armstrong Int'l Airport .

"Pensioner Dave Northcote has spent £55,000 on developing and manufacturing a device which helps put pillows into pillowcases . A pensioner has spent his life savings of £55,000 on an invention that helps put pillows into pillowcases - but has so far not sold a single device. Former care agency boss Dave Northcote came up with the idea after struggling with the chore while recovering from an operation. He has contacted major stores including Tesco, Sainsbury's and John Lewis, but has so far not sold any of the Easyfit devices, which have cost him and his wife their entire pension savings. The grandfather of 27 is now looking for a manufacturer to mass produce the device - a U-shaped plastic tray which slides the pillow into its case. Mr Northcote said his wife June, 67, is concerned about how much money has been spent on the invention, but he is confident it will take off. He said: 'To me this invention is another cat’s eyes. It works 100 per cent every time with every kind of pillow, from great big bulky ones to ones with memory foam.' The device comes in a deluxe 'Zoox' version, which is expected to retail for up to £15, and a £5 'Znooze' supermarket variety. Mr Northcote said most of the money had been spent on buying and fitting an industrial unit in West Heath, Birmingham, along with materials, machines, prototypes, patents, design rights and the registered trademark. He said: 'Both June and I have staked our entire pension savings of £55,000 but at no time did we give up hope that our patent would be granted. Scroll down for video . The device works by compressing the pillow into a shape with is then more easily slid into a pillow case . Once inside the pillowcase, the pillow is then able to expand back to its original shape . 'Once you’ve started, you’re committed to carrying on. We are living on our uppers, but we are happy as pigs in muck because we now have the patent and I have a lot of faith in this. 'Now at 68 and almost broke I feel it too late to start manufacturing and selling but we are hopeful someone will like our product enough to produce it under licence. And they can have a free one.' Mr Northcote said he came up with the idea while recovering at home from major surgery to have bones in his right arm fused. He said: 'I was doing chores around the . home and successfully tackled them all, except for putting pillows in . cases. It just came into my head. If you have a problem, solve it, my . mother used to say.' Mr Northcote said his wife June, 67, is concerned about how much money has been spent on the invention, but he is confident it will take off . The grandfather of 27 is now looking for a manufacturer to mass produce the device - a U-shaped plastic tray which slides the pillow into its case . Mr Northcote said the device works by compressing the pillow into a shape which can then be placed into the pillow. He said: 'Because pillows are getting bigger and plumper and are now a lot bigger than most pillow cases, this product compresses the pillow into a funnel, then it expands inside the case.' He believes the invention could be used to save hours of work at hotels, hospitals and care homes. He, his wife and their 40-year-old son Darren have already made 400 of the products and had them tested at hotels.","Dave Northcote came up with idea while recovering at home from operation .

Guthmiller's flight began May 31. Scroll down for video . Going places! Matt Guthmiller, the youngest pilot to fly solo around the world, arrives at Gillespie Field in El Cajon, Calif. on Monday . Record-breaker: The young pilot's progress was tracked in real time at Limitless Horizons . Success: The 19-year-old student from South Dakota, left May 31 from Gillespie Field to circumnavigate the globe in a leased 1981 prop-powered, single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza A36 . His final, 16-hour leg took him from Honolulu, Hawaii, over the Pacific Ocean to El Cajon. The Aberdeen, South Dakota, native was greeted by reporters and his mother in El Cajon as he said: 'It's great to be back.' Shirley Guthmiller was at the front of the crowd having flown in from Aberdeen earlier that day. As the family had an exclusivity contract with 'The Today Show,' she told U-T San Diego she would not be able to comment at length to any other media. 'It was a lot of fun,' Matt said before being whisked into a private area in the High Performance Aircraft's main building. Homecoming: Matt Guthmiller, right, the youngest pilot to fly solo around the world, walks with his mother Shirley after arriving at Gillespie Field . Proud: Guthmiller said little to reporters besides that 'it was fun' before being whisked back to a private staging area at the airport . Father Allen Guthmiller told reporters that he was extremely proud of his boy but not at all surprised . 'This . was a kid that was afraid to go into the basement,' he . said. 'He's not afraid of the dark now. He flew a lot of miles at night. He had everything planned out since day one. Matt has that engineer's . mentality that all the kids at MIT have. He's always been a step ahead. And when he says he's going to do something, he's going to find a way to . do it.'

Matt made 25 stops in 14 different countries across five continents during his journey, including London in the UK, Rome in Italy, Athens in Greece, Cairo in Egypt and Bangkok in Thailand. 'Nothing is impossible,' he wrote on the website during the journey. 'And I’ve never been the kind of person to just hang around and wait for great things to happen. If you really want to achieve something great you have to go out and get it.' Bon voyage: Matt Guthmiller lands safely at Manila International Airport on Tuesday, July 1, in this photograph . Homesick: Matt Guthmiller said he did not expect to be spending his American fourth of July celebrations flying solo across Australia . His love of flying dates back to the days he logged hundreds of hours on flight simulator games as a child. 'My real goal is to inspire other young people to attempt things of a similar magnitude. That's what I hope to accomplish with this flight,' he said. Matt documented his adventure through Limitless Horizons, a non-profit fundraiser.

"The International Olympic Committee has rushed to the defence of China's 'supergirl swimmer' Ye Shiwen, joining a chorus against a U.S. coach's claim that she may have turned to doping to boost her performance. The IOC is the latest agency to weigh in on the story of the swimming sensation, who captured the gold medal in the 400m individual medley on Saturday, and at one point even besting the pace of male swimmer Ryan Lochte. Miss Ye's performance led one U.S. coach to call her gold medal-winning performance 'unbelievable' and 'disturbing,' and suggested doping may be behind it. Scroll down for IOC reaction . Record breaker: Ye Shiwen knocked five seconds off her personal best and broke the world record by more than a second as she stormed to gold in the 400m individual medley in the London Olympics . Beaten: Ryan Lochte, pictured, was slower than Ye over the last 50 metres of his own medley race . John Leonard, the U.S. executive . director of the World Swimming Coaches Association, described Ye's swim - who last night broke the Olympic record . in another event - as 'unbelievable' and 'disturbing.' In response, International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said: 'We need to get real here. These are the . world's best athletes competing at the very highest level. 'We've seen . all sorts of records broken already all over the place.' Mr Adams' remarks echoed those of the sport's president, who said that suspicions that Miss Ye doped were 'crazy' and motivated by jealousy. Adams said the top five athletes in each event, plus two others, are tested as part of 'a very, very strong drug-testing program, and we are very confident if there are cheats we will catch them.' 'We can't stop speculation. It is inevitably a sad result of the fact that there are people who dope and who cheat,' Adams said. 'It's very sad we can't applaud a great performance. Let's give the benefit of the doubt to the athletes.' Ye won the 400-meter individual . medley on the opening day of the Olympic swimming competition, and captured another world record when she won the 200 intermediate yesterday. Last night, a Chinese . anti-doping official hit back at the U.S., saying China never questioned . Michael Phelps' astonishing eight-gold medal run in the 2008 Beijing . Olympics. Jiang Zhixue told the country's Xinhua news agency that Leonard's claims were completely unreasonable. He said: 'I think it is not proper to . single Chinese swimmers out once they produce good results. Some people . are just biased. We never questioned Michael Phelps when he bagged . eight gold medals in Beijing.' His claims were backed by British Olympic Association boss Lord Colin Moynihan who said that Ye had passed all drug tests required of medal winners, and is 'clean'. Lord Moynihan told reporters: 'She's been through [the World Anti-Doping Agency's] program and she's clean. That's the end of the story. Ye Shiwen deserves recognition for her talent.' Outspoken: Top US swimming coach John Leonard called the feat 'unbelievable' Leonard's claims came as anti-doping . officials revealed that cleaners and security staff have been asked to . spy on athletes in the Olympic Village and report anything suspicious . that could be linked to performance-enhancing drugs. Miss Ye’s gold medal came in the 400m . individual medley, in which she swam the last 50m of the freestyle leg . in 28.93 seconds – compared with the 29.1 seconds that 27-year-old . American Ryan Lochte managed in the men’s event minutes earlier. Her time for the whole event was more than five seconds better than her previous best. Pressed on the use of drugs she told . the China News Service last night: ‘There is absolutely no problem with . doping. The Chinese have always had a firm policy about doping. My . results come from hard work and training and I would never use any . banned drugs. The Chinese people have clean hands.’ But Mr Leonard compared the final 100m . swum by Miss Ye as being ‘reminiscent’ of some old East German . swimmers, several of whom were subsequently exposed for using . performance-enhancing drugs. He said Miss Ye looks like Superwoman, . adding: ‘Any time someone has looked like Superwoman in the history of . our sport they have later been found guilty of doping.’ If someone could outpace one of the . fastest male swimmers in the world and finish three-and-a-half lengths . ahead of her nearest female rival, he said, ‘all those things, I think, . legitimately call that swim into question’. Head and shoulders above: The teenager (centre) holds an unassailable lead during her gold medal winning 400 metre medley race . Ye said her success was due to her training since she was identified as a potential champion . Medal winners: Ye Shiwen shows off the gold alongside the United States' Elizabeth Beisel, left, and compatriot Li Xuanxu following the final . Mr Leonard also called for an . investigation into the Chinese, saying they could be using genetic . manipulation. ‘It is a result that demands an explanation - it is . unprecedented,’ he told the Mail. Genetic manipulation in animals, he . said, had given added strength and oxygen usage. ‘Who knows what it can . do to humans?’ he added. Questions over Shiwen's performance come after a string of Chinese swimmers tested positive for doping in recent years. China won 12 of the 16 women's titles at the 1994 world championships in Rome but these achievements were sullied less than a month later when seven Chinese swimmers tested positive for banned drugs at the Asian Games in Hiroshima. At the 1998 world championships in Perth, four Chinese competitors were sent home after testing positive for steroids. It came a week after one of their team mates and her coach were caught smuggling human growth hormone at Sydney Airport. China's top backstroke swimmer and . record holder Ouyang Kunpeng, now 29, was given a lifetime ban after he . tested positive for the same substance a month before the 2008 Beijing . Olympics. The ban was later changed to two years. In 2009, five junior Chinese swimmers were banned for two years by the country's swimming association after they tested positive for the anabolic agent clenbuterol - a performance-enhancing drug. And in June Chinese state media said . 16-year-old Li Zhesi, part of the country’s winning team at the 2009 . World Championships, had tested positive for a performance-enhancing . drug, EPO, which boosts the body’s oxygen supplies. And he said Miss Ye’s performance had . brought ‘back a lot of awful memories’ of Irish swimmer Michelle Smith’s . winning performance at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. Smith was banned . for four years in 1998 for tampering with a drug test. As a gold medal winner, Miss Ye will have been automatically drug-tested. The top four in each race are routinely tested. Last night she continued her . astonishing success by setting a new Olympic record in the semi-finals . of her best event, the 200m individual medley, with a time of 2 minutes and 8.39 seconds. Jonathan Harris, London 2012’s head of . anti-doping, said that organisers had made security, cleaning, events . services and others ‘very aware of the issue of doping, so if they were . to come across practices, paraphernalia, whatever it may be, then they . would bring it to our attention and, of course, we would investigate . this and treat it as intelligence.' A source close to the British swimming . team, who did not want to be named, said yesterday: 'There has been a . lot of talk since Saturday about the Chinese swimmers, particularly Ye, . and how they are managing to come out of nowhere and achieve these . incredible times. 'We all know about the kind of punishing regimes the . Chinese swimmers are put through.’ One insight came on Sunday. After . winning silver in the 100m butterfly, Chinese athlete Lu Ling said: ‘In . China we’re used to study, study and train, train and then rest. I think . our way of thinking has many limits. In Australia I’ve been invited to . barbecues with my teammates - that would never happen in China.’ Officials say there have been 1,461 . drug tests carried out so far in this Olympics - no results are yet . known - and that testers can take samples at any time. Prof John Brewer, Board Member of UK Anti-Doping and Director of Sport at the University of Bedfordshire, said: 'The drug testing procedures in place at the London 2012 Olympics are extremely rigorous and the storage of samples for eight years after the Games makes doping an very high risk strategy. 'We should not be surprised by exceptional performances since Gold medal winning athletes are inevitably different to the rest of us due to their talent, training and lifestyles. 'It's also worth remembering that China has a vast pool of talent to choose from due to the size of its population, so we should not be too surprised when an individual with exceptional talent emerges.' Congratulations: Ye Shiwen hugs Xuanxu Li after her victory at the Aquatics Centre at the Olympic Park . Sensation: Ye Shiwen managed to swim the final 50m length in the race in . a time of 28.93, a time that was quicker than the men's champion Ryan . Lochte . Disappointed: Lochte shakes hand with Michael Phelps after they won silver in the 4x100m relay . Reminiscent?

"It has a population of 12 million, numerous squares, skyscrapers and even a port - all planned in meticulous detail. Yet the city of Urville exists only in the mind of French autistic-savant Giles Trehin who has spent 20 years planning out the city in his mind. His drawings garnered such a following online that they were turned into a book. The 40-year-old artist, from Cagnes sur Mer, near Nice in south-east France, has dedicated his life to the imaginary city, recording every intricate detail. La belle ville: One of the many squares that artist Gilles Trehin has created in his imaginary French city of Urville . The artist has even presented his plans for the fictional city to conferences on Autism around the world. Mr Trehin said: 'I have been drawing since the age of five. I have always been fascinated by big cities and aeroplanes. 'Since 1984, I started to be interested by the conception of an imaginary city. 'I called it Urville - the name comes from ""Dumont d'Urville"" which is a scientific base in a French territory of the Antarctic.' According to the Wisconsin Medical . Society, Mr Trehin said: 'It's in 1984 that the idea of an imaginary . city became concrete, during one of my vacation journeys back in New . York city. After this trip, I lived in London between 1984 and 1986.' Avenues of the mind: Gilles Trehin began to design his imaginary city from the age of 12 having been inspired by New York and London . Visions: The artist originally began constructing the city of Urville in Lego but soon his ideas outstretched the bricks . Potrait of an artist: Gilles Trehin, 40,  who is an autistic savant, has created detail maps of an imaginary city called Urville since the age of 12 . Mr Trehin originally began building the city in Lego but soon decided it could be more easily expanded by drawing it. 'After 1987, there was a big evolution in my conception of the city,' he said. 'I realised that I could expand the city in my mind without necessarily building it in Lego bricks and compensate this by drawing.' Trehin’s book traces the history of . the city - from the Second World War's impact on Urville and even stretching back to the French Revolution. Connection: Artist Gilles Trehin with his girlfriend Catherine Mouet (left) who is also an artist and has Asperger's Syndrome. Trehin's book Urville (right) 'In 1789, during the French Revolution, Urville has 2.8 millions inhabitants, but the number of habitations became too limited to host the huge population growth due to the Industrial Revolution,' he writes. 'In order to cope, the authorities of Urville call upon the famous town-planner Oscar Laballière (1803/ 1883) to start gigantic urban projects which are still outlining Urville even today.' The book brings together 300 of Trehins drawings.

"A £175 Burberry shirt modelled by Romeo Beckham in a fashion shoot for Vogue magazine has been found to be contaminated with toxic chemicals. The shirt was among a number of children’s items that were tested as part of a Greenpeace investigation into the use of potentially harmful chemicals during manufacturing. The same research found suspect residues in products sold by other big brands such as Disney, American Apparel, GAP and Primark. Fashion victim: This £175 Burberry metallic shirt modelled by Romeo Beckham in a fashion shoot for Vogue magazine has been found to be contaminated with toxic chemicals . There is no evidence that the levels of chemicals found would cause immediate harm to children wearing them, however Greenpeace argues they should be removed on a precautionary basis. Eleven-year-old Romeo, who is the second of David and Victoria Beckham’s four children, was hired by Burberry last year to front a high profile marketing campaign. Following his designer mother into the fashion world, he was hand-picked by Burberry’s chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey. The campaign saw him wearing a purple metallic shirt alongside models Edie Campbell and Cara Delavingne as part of the Spring/Summer 2013 collection in a photo-shoot by the renowned Mario Testino. Rising star: Eleven-year-old Romeo, who is the second of David and Victoria Beckham's four children, was hired by Burberry last year to front a high profile marketing campaign alongside Edie Campbell and Cara Delevingne . The shirt was tested as part of the Greenpeace Detox campaign investigation and was found to contain a relatively high level - 780 mg/kg – of nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs). NPEs are man-made chemicals that are widely used as surfactants or detergents by textiles manufacturers during the manufacture of the cloth. Once released to the environment, NPEs degrade to nonylphenols (NP), which are known to be toxic and act as hormone disrupters. They will accumulate in the body over time. The £175 shirt was made in Tunisia and purchased in the UK from the firm’s online store. Greenpeace said there is absolutely no criticism of the Beckhams, however it said manufacturers such as Burberry should do more to remove suspect chemicals from the production process and their garments. Top model: Following his designer mother into the fashion world, Romeo was hand-picked by Burberry¿s chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey . Burberry insisted its products do not pose any risk to customers. The successful British brand said it is working with Greenpeace to reduce the use of suspect chemicals in the manufacturing process. A spokesman said: ‘The safety and welfare of our customers is paramount and Burberry complies with all international environmental and safety standards. Burberry products do not pose a danger to customers.’ Graham Thompson, a spokesman for the Greenpeace Detox campaign, said: ‘Until the textile industry detox and switch to safer chemicals, we’ll all be exposed to these hazardous substances. ‘Whether you are a child from a poor background living downstream from the factories in Asia or Africa, or the wearer of a £175 shirt, all are impacted. ‘The Greenpeace Detox campaign has been working with major fashion labels to solve this problem. 'We want to help Burberry become a real market leader by joining  the forward-thinking brands already committed to being part of the solution.’","Purple metallic shirt worn by Romeo, 11, in shoot for Vogue magazine .

"The most expensive and luxurious Range Rover ever created by the British 4X4 firm is revealed today – with a right royal £140,000 price tag to match. The target audience for the sumptuous off-roader is royalty – both the blue-blooded real and the ‘tinsel-town’ Hollywood variety - as well as ministers and senior politicians and top sporting stars. After his birth, baby Prince George arrived back from hospital to Kensington Palace with Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge in a Range Rover – after his father skilfully strapped him into  his child seat. The new Range Rover, which will be available in a premium Autobiography Black version, will be delivered to UK customers in August 2014 and cost £140,000 . The car will be the first Range Rover with a long wheel-base aimed at giving A-list passengers extra legroom while they are driven by their chauffeurs . The interior will feature leather and wood trims along with mood lighting and programmable settings for each seat . The new range-topping super-luxury Autobiography Black derivative of the Range Rover offers rear occupants fully adjustable reclining first class airline style seats with in-built massager, champagne chiller, individual electronic tables in black leather, mood lighting in ten colours, as well as a range of luxurious leather, wood and other interior trim. Despite its name, it will also be available in white and other colours, as ‘Black’ is a term used in the automotive industry to denote a prestige model. For the first time in 20 years Jaguar Land Rover is also offering customers a long wheel-base version of the Range Rover – giving five and a half inches of extra legroom to occupants in a bid to capture more of the limousine market for chauffeured VIPs. A Land Rover spokesman said: ‘This will be the most expensive and luxurious Range Rover ever.’ It is powered by a 5.0 litre supercharged V8 petrol engine which propels it from rest to 60mph in just 5.5 seconds to a top speed of 140mph. The most luxurious Range Rover Autobiography Black makes its world debut at the Dubai International Motor Show on November 5 and will be available in long wheel-base form only in the UK. Despite all the comfort and luxury, the new Range Rover is powered by a supercharged V8 engine and will do 0-60mph in 5.5 seconds . All seats come complete with massagers, the rear chairs can recline like First Class airline seats and there is also a champagne chiller . As well as enjoying all that extra space, rear passengers can also enjoy 10.2in television screens behind the blacked-out windows . It has been designed and engineered by Jaguar Land Rover’s new Engineered To Order division to combine luxury, design and 4X4 performance. It and other long wheel-base models will then appear later in November at the Los Angeles Motor Show in the US and at the Guangzhou motor show in  China – both vital and booming markets for the UK luxury car maker. Land Rover said: ‘The first Range Rover long wheel-base in 20 years will cater for a growing group of consumers looking for the ultimate sports utility vehicle and a unique alternative to the traditional long wheelbase saloon cars. 'It represents the pinnacle of desirability to bring even higher levels of refinement to the world’s finest luxury sports utility vehicle.’ Range Rover is already the car of choice for celebrities arriving at red carpet events and film premieres and Jaguar Land Rover hope the long wheel-base and Autobiography Black versions will be ‘even more appealing’. Daniel Craig arrived at the Skyfall Bond premiere in a Range Rover. Last week Hollywood actor Chris Hemsworth arrived at the Thor premiere in one. Brad Pitt is currently filming in the UK and has been spotted being driven to and from Pinewood studios in a Range Rover. Range Rovers are already used by a host of the rich and famous, including Daniel Craig, Brad Pitt, and Prince William . The Autobiography Black, the most exclusive version of the new Range Rover, will be available in a range of colours, as the 'Black' refers to its premium status . The Autobiography Black will make its world debut at the Dubai International Motor Show on November 5 . One insider said: ‘The new long wheel-base version is also expected to be a big hit with royalty, top politicians and diplomats who need a chauffeur vehicle which is luxurious but safe. 'When the Duke of Cambridge collected the Duchess and Prince George from hospital his choice of vehicle was a Range Rover.’ First customer deliveries of Range Rover long wheel-base versions will be from March 2014 with Autobiography Black deliveries commencing in August 2014. A ‘green’ Range Rover Hybrid derivative will also become available later in 2014. It is the first Range Rover long wheel-base since the Range Rover LSE which ran from 1992 to 1994. John Edwards, managing director of the Individual Products Division said: ‘This exclusive vehicle offers our customers an unrivalled and luxurious driving experience that provides a seamless integration between the needs of business and leisure.’ Phil Popham, group marketing director for Jaguar Land Rover said: ’The Range Rover Autobiography Black is our most luxurious specification yet. 'It epitomises sophisticated design with immaculate attention to detail. The subtle, elegant and luxurious finishing touches combine with a first class experience for both driver and passengers to deliver new levels of exclusivity to our customers.’ Land Rover design director Gerry McGovern, said: ’The Range Rover Autobiography Black is an intensely design focused response to our customers’ desire for more choice and exclusivity.

"A diplomatic storm was brewing last night over Olympic swimming sensation Ye Shiwen. The Chinese 16-year-old was forced to deny using drugs after a respected US coach called her gold medal-winning performance ‘unbelievable’. But her defiant pledge that the world record-breaking swim on Saturday – which saw her outpace the winner of the men’s event – came purely from ‘hard work and training’ failed to defuse a doping controversy gripping London 2012. Scroll down for IOC reaction . Record breaker: Ye Shiwen knocked five seconds off her personal best and broke the world record by more than a second as she stormed to gold in the 400m individual medley in the London Olympics . Beaten: Ryan Lochte, pictured, was slower than Ye over the last 50 metres of his own medley race . John Leonard, the US executive . director of the World Swimming Coaches Association, described Saturday’s . swim by ‘Supergirl’ Miss Ye – who last night broke the Olympic record . in another event – as ‘unbelievable’ and ‘disturbing’. He also made the extraordinary suggestion that the Chinese could be using genetic manipulation to enhance performances. Outspoken: Top US swimming coach John Leonard called the feat 'unbelievable' His claims came as anti-doping . officials revealed that cleaners and security staff have been asked to . spy on athletes in the Olympic Village and report anything suspicious . that could be linked to performance-enhancing drugs. Miss Ye’s gold medal came in the 400m . individual medley, in which she swam the last 50m of the freestyle leg . in 28.93 seconds – compared with the 29.1 seconds that 27-year-old . American Ryan Lochte managed in the men’s event minutes earlier. Her time for the whole event was more than five seconds better than her previous best. Pressed on the use of drugs she told . the China News Service last night: ‘There is absolutely no problem with . doping. The Chinese have always had a firm policy about doping. My . results come from hard work and training and I would never use any . banned drugs. The Chinese people have clean hands.’ But Mr Leonard compared the final 100m . swum by Miss Ye as being ‘reminiscent’ of some old East German . swimmers, several of whom were subsequently exposed for using . performance-enhancing drugs. He said Miss Ye looks like Superwoman, . adding: ‘Any time someone has looked like Superwoman in the history of . our sport they have later been found guilty of doping.’ If someone could outpace one of the . fastest male swimmers in the world and finish three-and-a-half lengths . ahead of her nearest female rival, he said, ‘all those things, I think, . legitimately call that swim into question’. Head and shoulders above: The teenager (centre) holds an unassailable lead during her gold medal winning 400 metre medley race . Ye said her success was due to her training since she was identified as a potential champion . Medal winners: Ye Shiwen shows off the gold alongside the United States' Elizabeth Beisel, left, and compatriot Li Xuanxu following the final . Mr Leonard also called for an . investigation into the Chinese, saying they could be using genetic . manipulation. ‘It is a result that demands an explanation – it is . unprecedented,’ he told the Mail. Genetic manipulation in animals, he . said, had given added strength and oxygen usage. ‘Who knows what it can . do to humans?’ he added. Questions over Shiwen's performance come after a string of Chinese swimmers tested positive for doping in recent years. China won 12 of the 16 women's titles at the 1994 world championships in Rome but these achievements were sullied less than a month later when seven Chinese swimmers tested positive for banned drugs at the Asian Games in Hiroshima. At the 1998 world championships in Perth, four Chinese competitors were sent home after testing positive for steroids. It came a week after one of their team mates and her coach were caught smuggling human growth hormone at Sydney Airport. China's top backstroke swimmer and . record holder Ouyang Kunpeng, now 29, was given a lifetime ban after he . tested positive for the same substance a month before the 2008 Beijing . Olympics. The ban was later changed to two years. In 2009, five junior Chinese swimmers were banned for two years by the country's swimming association after they tested positive for the anabolic agent clenbuterol - a performance-enhancing drug. And in June Chinese state media said . 16-year-old Li Zhesi, part of the country’s winning team at the 2009 . World Championships, had tested positive for a performance-enhancing . drug, EPO, which boosts the body’s oxygen supplies. And he said Miss Ye’s performance had . brought ‘back a lot of awful memories’ of Irish swimmer Michelle Smith’s . winning performance at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. Smith was banned . for four years in 1998 for tampering with a drugs test. As a gold medal winner, Miss Ye will have been automatically drug-tested. The first four in each race are routinely tested. Last night she continued her . astonishing success by setting a new Olympic record in the semi-finals . of her best event, the 200m individual medley, with a time of 2 mins . 8.39 seconds. Jonathan Harris, London 2012’s head of . anti-doping, said that organisers had made security, cleaning, events . services and others ‘very aware of the issue of doping, so if they were . to come across practices, paraphernalia, whatever it may be, then they . would bring it to our attention and, of course, we would investigate . this and treat it as intelligence.’ A source close to the British swimming . team, who did not want to be named, said yesterday: ‘There has been a . lot of talk since Saturday about the Chinese swimmers, particularly Ye, . and how they are managing to come out of nowhere and achieve these . incredible times. 'We all know about the kind of punishing regimes the . Chinese swimmers are put through.’ One insight came on Sunday. After . winning silver in the 100m butterfly, Chinese athlete Lu Ling said: ‘In . China we’re used to study, study and train, train and then rest. I think . our way of thinking has many limits. In Australia I’ve been invited to . barbecues with my teammates – that would never happen in China.’ Officials say there have been 1,461 . drug tests carried out so far in this Olympics – no results are yet . known – and that testers can take samples at any time. Prof John Brewer, Board Member of UK Anti-Doping and Director of Sport at the University of Bedfordshire, said: 'The drug testing procedures in place at the London 2012 Olympics are extremely rigorous and the storage of samples for eight years after the Games makes doping an very high risk strategy. 'We should not be surprised by exceptional performances since Gold medal winning athletes are inevitably different to the rest of us due to their talent, training and lifestyles. 'It's also worth remembering that China has a vast pool of talent to choose from due to the size of its population, so we should not be too surprised when an individual with exceptional talent emerges.' Congratulations: Ye Shiwen hugs Xuanxu Li after her victory at the Aquatics Centre at the Olympic Park . Sensation: Ye Shiwen managed to swim the final 50m length in the race in . a time of 28.93, a time that was quicker than the men's champion Ryan . Lochte . Disappointed: Lochte shakes hand with Michael Phelps after they won silver in the 4x100m relay . Reminiscent?

"Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny might be feeling slightly sorry for himself, having been dropped to the bench by Arsene Wenger. However the Pole might be pleased to know he has been voted Championship side Brentford’s top goalkeeper of the past decade, having made just 28 appearances for the Bees back in 2009-10 on loan from the Gunners. Brentford ran the week-long poll on Twitter to mark ten years of the Football League Awards, which will find a ‘Team of the Decade’ to mark the occasion.

The award could soften the blow for Szczesny that he has lost his place to David Ospina in the Arsenal net following a series of errors and then angering Arsene Wenger by smoking in the showers after their 2-0 defeat to Southampton on New Year’s Day. Ospina has impressed with a string of strong displays as the Arsenal No 1 with four clean sheets in six games and conceding just three goals. Meanwhile since the costly defeat at Southampton, Szczesny has featured just once in the 3-2 FA Cup victory at Brighton. It remains to be seen whether the Pole will start against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup at the Emirates this Sunday, as he aims to wrestle back the starting role. Szczesny dives for a save for the Bees, who he played 28 times for during the 2009-10 season on loan .

"Savannah Guthrie, the replacement for Today show presenter Ann Curry, is already failing to impress audiences with her Olympics coverage. TV network NBC flew fellow presenter Hoda Kotb to London this weekend to help 'bring the show to life' following poor viewing figures on the first day of broadcast last Thursday. The dramatic move comes after Today's Olympics build-up fell short fell in the ratings war with rival network ABC's Good Morning America. Unpopular: Olympics coverage by Today's Savannah Guthrie, left, and Matt Lauer failed to draw in the viewers last week . Centre of the action: Hoda Kotb is bringing her unique brand of fun to the Today show's Games coverage . 'They called Hoda on Thursday begging her to go to London because they said it wasn’t working like they thought,' an insider told the New York Daily News. She joined Guthrie and co-hosts Matt Lauer, Natalie Morales and Al Roker in London. Grey day in London: The NBC show is currently losing out in the Olympics season ratings war to ABC's Good Morning America . Former frontwoman: The news that Guthrie needed rescuing may have caused ex-Today host Ann Curry some glee . Kotb, who usually co-hosts the raucous fourth hour of Today with Kathie Lee Gifford, was set to be starting a two-week break from the show, but instead headed to the UK to join in the action. The 47-year-old tweeted on Friday after completing her . show: 'Packing my bags and heading to London . this weekend — thx for all the story suggestions. You know I will do . them!' The Kathie Lee & Hoda blog currently says the show is 'on Olympic hiatus for a little while.' Kotb was rumored to be the front-runner for Curry's position around the time of the former Today . show anchor's teary departure on June 28. But when asked at the time if she was . interested in the role she reportedly said she was 'joyful . where I am.' Guthrie, the show's co-hosts, and . special prime-time Olympic correspondents, Meredith Vieira and Ryan . Seacrest have all had their roles established for months, the source . said. 'They're just shoehorning Hoda into the show to help bring it alive', the source added. Guthrie, 40, was promoted from host of the 9am hour but Today has not once beaten Good Morning America in the ratings since she arrived on July 9. Neilsen ratings showed that in her first week on Today, ABC’s GMA drew 4.598 million viewers compared to NBC's comparatively lacklustre 4.245 million.

Sometimes in the studio that seems overwhelming.

Since her sudden and unexpected promotion . Guthrie is said to be taking migraine medication and visiting doctors . regularly to cope with the stress of declining figures. At 40, Guthrie is 15 years younger than . ousted host Ann Curry who returned to TV screens earlier than she had . anticipated to cover the Colorado shootings. The two women appeared professional . during the coverage as Curry reported from the field to Guthrie who was . seated in the studio on the very sofa that Curry warmed for 15 years. But . sources have told Radar Online that with the news of Guthrie's poor . performance in London, Curry is secretly rubbing her hands in glee. 'Ann . feels completely vindicated by the TODAY show's poor ratings since she . left,' said the source who claims to be close to the situation. 'She . feels she was fired completely unfairly and wasn't given a fair shot at . the gig.' 'Ann feels she was made a scapegoat by the network and that it's the whole show that needed an overhaul, not her replacing,' the insider continued. 'She feels they should have booked better guests and had a more exciting line-up and better stories to cover and better writing. 'Ann believes that point has been proved by the show's ratings declining even further since she left.' Despite . these beliefs, however, the source insisted that in her new role as . anchor-at-large, Curry does not harbour any personal resentment for . Guthrie. 'She has no . hard feelings towards Savannah,' the insider told Radar, adding that . when it comes to Matt Lauer, however, 'there's definitely no love . lost... 'She feels [he] threw her under the bus completely.' NBC has the exclusive rights to televise . the Olympics in the US, so the network will be hoping for a rapid . improvement on the coverage now that the quirky, upbeat Kathie Lee & . Hoda host has arrived in London. During the Olympics, Today’s audience reportedly usually increases by around 30 per cent on average. But when Thursday's pre-Olympics coverage did not beat Good Morning America, Kotb 'didn't hesitate in saying yes'. A spokeswoman for Today did not respond to a request for comment.","NBC show losing to ABC's Good Morning America in ratings war .

"The director of the Kony 2012 video was suffering from 'reactive psychosis' when he was filmed running through the streets of San Diego naked and ranting about the devil, his family have said. Invisible Children co-founder Jason Russell was taken away by police responding to complaints about him cursing, potentially . masturbating and pounding the pavement at an . intersection last week. Russell's wife Danica and other relatives have said he was suffering from the condition due to stress, exhaustion and dehydration after his video of the Ugandan war criminal granted him overnight fame. Scroll down for video . Disturbed: Kony 2012 co-founder Jason Russell was caught having his public meltdown on camera . 'The preliminary diagnosis he received is called brief reactive psychosis, an acute state brought on by the extreme exhaustion, stress and dehydration,' the family said, the Los Angeles Times reported. 'Though new to us, the doctors say . this is a common experience given the great mental, emotional and . physical shock his body has gone through in these last two weeks.' The statement . hinted that the criticism of the Invisible Children video may have . contributed to Russell's extreme behavior. He had devoted his adult life to the cause, it said. 'Because of how . personal the film is, many of the attacks against it were also very . personal and Jason took them very hard,' it added. Diagnosis: His family, including his wife Danica (pictured), has released a statement saying doctors said Mr Russell was suffering from extreme exhaustion, stress and dehydration . Support: The family, including Danica (right), said Mr Russell (second left) took attacks on the film personally . Critics had lambasted the video about . militia leader Joseph Kony as incorrect, claiming it had made mistakes . about the current violence in Uganda and the strength of Kony's forces. His family added it had expected 'a few thousand people' to watch the film - now seen by 84 million people around the world. Arrested: Jason Russell, director of the 'Kony 2012' video, was allegedly seen wandering the streets . San Diego police took father-of-two Russell to a mental-health facility for observation after he was spotted running naked through a Pacific Beach neighbourhood last Thursday. Earlier this week, TMZ released a close-range video of . Mr Russell pacing back and forth along a busy San Diego sidewalk, . shouting: 'You're the devil.' Witnesses had called police to report . 'the underwear-clad male was in the street, interfering with traffic, . screaming, yelling incoherently and pounding his fists on the sidewalk', . police said. Russell was calm and . co-operative when apprehended by police, according to NBC San Diego, but . seemed to be under the influence of alcohol. Danica denied her husband has any substance abuse or drinking problems. Although he was not charged with a . crime, officials decided that Russell should be committed to hospital for . medical treatment following the incident. 'During the evaluation we learned that . we probably needed to take care of him,' a police spokesman said. 'So . officers detained him and transferred him to a local medical facility . for further evaluation.' His family concluded: 'The focus remains only on his health, and protecting our family. We'll . take care of Jason, you take care of the work. The message of the film remains the same: Stop at nothing.' Ben Keesey, chief executive of . Invisible Children, the charity set up in 2004 by Mr Russell and two . friends, issued a statement of support for his colleague. Campaigner: Mr Russell on a trip to Africa, where he was first inspired to set up the charity Invisible Children . Activist: The campaigner giving an impassioned talk about his work . 'The past two weeks have taken a . severe emotional toll on all of us, Jason especially, and that toll . manifested itself in an unfortunate incident yesterday,' he said. 'We will always love and support Jason, and we ask that you give his entire family privacy during this difficult time.' The Kony film has prompted a response from the Prime . Minister of Uganda, saying that the warlord at the heart of the video is . not in his country. Amama . Mbabazi said that the charity's video gives a 'false impression' and . that Joseph Kony is no longer in the country. 'The . Kony 2012 campaign fails to make one crucial point clear. Joseph Kony . is not in Uganda,' Mr Mbabazi said in a nine-minute video posted on . YouTube. Critic: The Ugandan prime minister Amama Mbabazi insisted the Kony 2012 video did not represent . the current situation in the east African nation and that the government was already on . Kony's trail . Target: Mr Russell's video is aimed at Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony . The Prime Minister insisted that the Kony 2012 video did not represent the current situation in the east African nation.

"Ten public schools have produced one in eight of the professional elite who effectively run the country, a report revealed yesterday. Eton College alone boasts four per cent of the nation’s most prominent citizens  as old boys, including Prime Minister David Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Justin Welby, the next  Archbishop of Canterbury. Almost a third of those holding senior positions in business, politics, law and the diplomatic service also have an Oxbridge education, the study found. Fee-paying: Left, David Cameron went to Eton and wife Samantha to Marlborough College. Right, Boris Johnson also went to Eton and wife Marina Wheeler to the European School of Brussels . Acting royalty: Actor Daniel Craig is one of just 10 per cent of successful figures who went to a comprehensive while his actress wife Rachel Weisz attended a series of highly regarded private schools . Singer Florence Welch went to private school while actress Keira Knightley went to a comprehensive . The report by the Sutton Trust examined the educational backgrounds of 8,000 people who appeared in the birthday lists of national newspapers last year. It found that the 50 schools with the highest numbers of notable former pupils were all fee-paying. Overall, 44 per cent of those on the birthday lists were privately-educated, 27 per cent from state grammar schools, and 10 per cent from comprehensives. This is despite only 6.5 per cent of the nation’s children being educated at private schools. Sixty-eight per cent of leading figures in ‘public service’ – which included royalty, lord-lieutenants, and others in national, public or local government organisations – were privately educated, followed by law (63 per cent), senior armed forces (60 per cent) and business (59 per cent). The police had the fewest number of leading figures who went to fee-paying schools, with only 13 per cent of chief constables and other senior officers. Fifty-seven per cent of top officers attended grammars. Ruling elite: How private schools dominate .

How to be famous: Who went to which school... The ten private schools which produced 12 per cent of the professional elite were Eton, Winchester, Charterhouse, Rugby, Westminster, Marlborough, Dulwich, Harrow,  St Paul’s Boys’ School and Well-ington College. The top comprehensives were Haverstock School in Chalk Farm, North London, which was attended by Ed and David Miliband, and Holland Park in Kensington, where Tony Benn sent his four children. The top grammar school, with 17 former pupils among the country’s leaders, was Watford Grammar, Hertfordshire, which is now a  comprehensive. High achievers who attended grammar schools included actors Ray Winstone and Emma Thompson, Martin O’Neill, the  Sunderland Football Club manager, and Sir Paul McCartney and Sir  Mick Jagger. The trend continues: Higher education institutions attended by the most senior people in the UK . Only 10 per cent of the elite attended comprehensives, including James Bond actor Daniel Craig and Foreign Secretary William Hague. Just 1 per cent went to secondary moderns, including actor Colin Firth and Olympic rower Sir Steve Redgrave. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust which aims to promote social mobility through education, said: ‘This analysis shows how dominant leading universities and schools remain across the professions in Britain. ‘That’s why it is so important  that access to our leading schools and universities is on the basis of ability alone. ‘We are working to improve social mobility in the early years, schools, universities and professions. ‘But studies like this show how  far we still need to go to improve social mobility and ensure that  every young person can achieve his or her potential, regardless of  their family background.'

"A school with pupils from more than 50 countries is to teach them all English as a foreign language. City of Leeds comprehensive, which has been transformed by the arrival of large numbers of migrants, is thought to be the first in the country to take the extraordinary step. At the last count it had on its books 55 nationalities and 50 languages or dialects, from Czech to Urdu. The multi-ethnic City of Leeds School is to teach English as a foreign language to all of its 314 pupils . The school's head, Georgiana Sale, hopes giving the pupils a better grounding in English will boost results . Pupils at the comprehensive come from nations around the world, and a minority are native English speakers . The new class will be compulsory for the 15 per cent of pupils who are native English speakers. Georgiana Sale, who is the headteacher, said they would gain as much as foreigners because their skills were so poor. Giving . a sobering overview of the problems faced by her staff, she said: ‘Many . of our pupils are not only new to English but they are not even . literate in their own language. ‘In some cases we are the first people to put a pen in their hand.’ She said she believed her school was the first to teach English as a foreign language to all its pupils. ‘The . closest thing I could find was a school in London where a lot of pupils . come from diplomatic circles with all the embassies nearby,’ she said. ‘That . is obviously very different to us. We are proud to be a multi-cultural . school and will continue to encourage new ideas to help us to be a . supportive and encouraging learning environment where all pupils are . given the same chances to learn. ‘Education is about giving children what they need and so we have asked ourselves: What do our children need?’ Mrs Sale, described as having 'boundless energy' by Ofsted, wants to raise standards at her school . The headmistress said her pupils' progress at GCSE level was being hampered by their poor English . But Andrew Carter, the Tory opposition leader on Leeds City Council, . condemned the move. ‘I don’t see how it’s going to be of any use to . these young people who will need to be employed to not have English as . their first language,’ he said. ‘To teach the national language as a foreign language seems to me to be almost throwing the towel in. ‘The . prime requisite of educating people of different nationalities who are . currently living here and could be living here for the rest of their . lives is they learn to speak English. 'It would appear to me that is going to be a secondary consideration and it can’t be.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage said ‘an open door on immigration’ was to blame for English becoming a second language for so many. He added: ‘I am just absolutely appalled we are allowing this to happen. It is just increasing division in our society.’ From next term 50 minutes a week will be spent teaching English to every pupil ‘as an additional language’. The . largest group is of Pakistani heritage and an Ofsted inspection a year . ago reported that ‘a significant number of students from Roma and . Traveller backgrounds have joined.’ The 314 pupils come from across Europe, Asia and Africa. Staff speaking a wide variety of languages have been hired to help the school function properly. Many teachers are relying on a ‘rusty O-level’ to teach foreign languages to primary school pupils, according to a study. Just . six months before a new duty is imposed to teach languages at the . schools, researchers found that teachers are often just ‘a page or two . ahead’ of the children in the textbooks they are using. In a quarter of primaries, not a single teacher has a languages qualification higher than a  GCSE or O-level. The . research  also found that language learning  is in ‘deep crisis’ in . sixth-forms amid perceptions that marking  of language A-levels is . ‘harsh’  and ‘erratic’. Teachers . told researchers they were happiest giving pupils songs, single words . and short phrases and struggled when it came to tackling grammar, . correct pronunciation, reading and writing. The findings are published by the CfBT Education Trust in conjunction with the British Council. Work ahead: Many of the children at the school have only arrived in Britain in the last four years .","Native English speakers are a minority at 314-pupil City of Leeds School .

"Judge Gareth Jones said that social services were not above the law . A judge has blasted social workers who he said illegally withheld a nine-year-old boy from his mother. Judge Gareth Jones said that social services were not above the law and that he suspected proper procedures were not followed in order to save money. Now the mother - who won an injunction to have her son returned to her immediately - is seeking damages from Anglesey County Council in North Wales. Her lawyer, Frances Jones, today confirmed the child had been returned to his mother immediately after the injunction was granted. She said: 'As the mother’s solicitor I am delighted to have played a part in bringing the child home. 'We are now continuing with the claim for damages.' The child was taken in as a temporary case while the mother received treatment in a psychiatric unit but was not returned to her for five months for which there was consent. When she came out of treatment she withdrew consent and asked for her son back. However social workers refused and put him in foster care. But they did not make applications for a care order first – so rights were denied. Their barrister David Abberton took the issue to court and said social services had acted unlawfully. Judge Gareth Jones, sitting at the family division of the high court in Mold, agreed and asked for his judgement to be made public so that lessons could be learned. The court heard how the child had been taken to hospital with pneumonia in March of last year and the mother had a short stay in a psychiatric ward. On release from hospital the boy was placed in foster care and in April, when she was back home, the mother asked for her son back. The judge said that once the mother indicated her consent for the child to be in care had been withdrawn, the local authority should have asked itself very carefully on what statutory basis it continued to place him with foster carers. Mr Abberton argued there was simply no legal basis at all which breached their client’s human rights to a family life. Under fire: The mother is seeking damages from Anglesey County Council in North Wales . Anglesey County Council claimed that it acted in good faith and said the placement was for the child’s welfare - but accepted that social workers had not followed the correct procedures. The judge said that once the mother’s consent was withdrawn the authority should have gone to court to apply for an emergency protection order or an interim care order. In the absence of any application to the court, the mother was entitled to remove the child from care at any time, he said. The authority had acted unreasonably by failing to initiative such applications. 'By failing to do so, they were essentially maintaining an unlawful position,' he said. The judge said that he was 'extremely critical' of the council’s conduct. No one dealing with the child had asked themselves under what lawful authority the child was being placed in care. 'Social services are not above the law and they, like everybody else, is subject to it' Judge Gareth Jones . 'The social services department of Ynys Mon Council in that respect, it seems to me, were acting beyond the proper control of that local authority’s legal department,' he said. They had failed to take proper legal steps, its failure to apply for orders meant that there was no judicial over-sight, the child was deprived independent representation to look after his interests. Judge Gareth Jones sad that he had previously voiced his concern about a health board case which involved Anglesey council. 'I have a suspicion, and it is only a suspicion, that this local authority may have fallen into the temptation of withholding the commencement of public proceedings for reasons of economy. I hope very much that this is not a correct suspicion. 'If that suspicion was well founded, that to my mind would be wholly unacceptable.' The judge said that the authority needed to carry out an urgent review of its internal procedures and he said that key personnel in positions of authority in social services and the children’s services department needed to be fully informed by the legal department of the legal framework in which they operated. 'Social services are not above the law and they, like everybody else, is subject to it,' he declared. The judge said that Anglesey Council needed to demonstrate to the public of Ynys Mon that it is 'able and competent' once again to administer its local authority function without outside intervention. It had 'failed abysmally' in the present case to demonstrate to the public that it could discharge its functions in a proper manner. He said he hoped very much that the lesson would be learned for future cases . The judge said the matter should be made public because if the public at large and those in authority were not aware of it there was no prospect of improvement. To conceal matters when they went badly wrong served no public purpose whatsoever. 'I see no reason why the court should connive in concealment of important information in cases of this kind,' he said. An Isle of Anglesey County Council spokesperson said: 'Due to ongoing legal considerations, we are not in a position to comment on this matter.'","Judge Gareth Jones said social services were not above the law .

"Hollywood stars, the political elite and the royal family sat side by side in the splendour of Saint George's Hall last night during a historic state banquet at Windsor Castle for Irish President Michael D Higgins. Daniel Day-Lewis and Dame Judi Dench, Irish rugby hero Brian O'Driscoll and his actress wife Amy Huberman, hat designer Philip Treacy, sculptor Sir Antony Gormley and Sir Terry Wogan were all welcomed to the Queen's home. To mark the occasion the Queen wore emeralds in honour of her guests. Scroll down for video . Grandeur: The Queen wore the Grand Duchess Vladimir of Russia's tiara which bore droplets of emeralds and The Delhi Durbar Necklace . Her tiara – the Grand Duchess Vladimir of Russia’s tiara - bore droplets of emeralds, chosen specifically for the occasion. The Queen otherwise would wear pearls. Grand Duchess Vladimir, also known as Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, wife of the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, was the aunt of Tsar Nicholas II, who was murdered alongside his family in 1918 by the Bolsheviks. Grand Duchess Vladimir was the grandest of the grand duchesses at the royal court and she was no fan of the Tsar’s wife, Alexandra. So she packed up her magnificent jewel collection and set up a rival court at which she could be the star of the show. Guests listen during a speech by Queen Elizabeth II in honour of the President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins at Windsor Castle .

The Queen addresses the assembled guests at the banquet at Windsor Castle. St George¿s Hall boasts Britain¿s longest table, a mahogany masterpiece measuring 168ft . One of her most dazzling pieces was this very tiara of 15 intertwined diamond circles strung together with a diamond ribbon on top and hung with articulating pendant pearls, made in the 1874 by Bolin, the Russian court jeweller. She hid this wonderful example of intricate Russian craftsmanship in the vault at Vladimir Palace in 1918 when she fled St. Petersburg in the wake of the revolution. It remained hidden away until a friend of the family who happened to be a member of the British Secret Intelligence Service smuggled the jewels out of Russia for the Grand Duchess, tucked away in a plain bag.

With her jewels finally returned to her, she split them up amongst her four children before passing away in Paris in 1920. This particular tiara went to her daughter, Princess Nicholas of Greece. Princess Nicholas sold her jewels to benefit both her family and Russian charities and she sold this one in 1921 to Queen Mary. Queen Mary had to have some repairs after the tiara made its journey to the UK.

It was inherited by Queen Elizabeth on Mary’s death in 1953 along with the rest of her remaining jewel collection. The necklace of diamonds and emeralds set in platinum and gold worn by the Queen was one of the principal elements of Queen Mary’s parure of diamonds and emeralds created for the Delhi Durbar of 1911. The parure consisted of The Delhi Durbar Tiara, a stomacher (incorporating Cullinan V and VIII diamonds), brooch, earrings and this necklace. The Cullinan VII was cut by Asscher’s as an 8.8 carat marquise and is suspended as an asymmetrical pendant on a detachable chain of ten graduated diamonds, to counterbalance the pear-shaped emerald pendant, which is pavé-set and similarly suspended from a detachable, graduated chain of 12 diamonds. The necklace incorporates nine of the Cambridge emeralds, originally owned by Queen Mary’s grandmother, the Duchess of Cambridge. The eight cabochon-cut emeralds are set between six large brilliant diamonds on a double platinum chain, with 94 smaller brilliant-cut diamonds. The necklace was inherited, along with the rest of the parure, by The Queen in 1953. During the banquet, the Irish song Molly Malone was played as the royal procession made its way into the room.

"President Barack Obama's approval rating continued to spiral downward this month, reaching yet another record low in a new poll. Just 40 percent of Americans praised Obama in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll while 54 percent said they were not happy with president. Obama's previous low came immediately prior to today's numbers in the news organizations' June survey. In that poll, 41 percent of respondents said they approved of Obama 53 percent said they disapproved. More bad news: President Barack Obama awoke this morning to another poll showing his approval ratings in the gutter as he entered into the third and final day of his US-Africa Leaders Summit . President Barack Obama's approval rating dropped to 40 percent this month - the lowest it's ever been.

A . majority, 60 percent, say they're not impressed with the way he's approached . global issues. Americans are still resentful of the economic downturn, as well. Less than three in 10 respondents told pollsters they were satisfied with . the state of the economy. And while Obama's favorability rating on the economy ticked up one . percentage from June to 42 percent approval,  the president has not had an approval rating on this issue above 50 percent since his first year . in office. Whether international or domestic, more people said they were dissatisfied . with the way the U.S. has handled every crisis, . including the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the fighting . between Israel and Hamas and the surge in Central American children . crossing the border. Americans are least satisfied with how the . situation at the border has been handled, with only 11 percent saying they are content . with the response so far. Asked specifically about how the U.S. should handle the more than 57,000 immigrant children who have illegally entered the country in the last fiscal year, the majority of respondents - 51 percent - said 'we . do not have the resources' to provide for the children and 'they should be returned . immediately.' Meanwhile, 43 percent said the U.S. has a 'responsibility to . look out for children who are fleeing crime and violence in their own . country.' Congress fared a little better in this month's poll, getting a one percent boost, but the legislative branch is still stuck in the red with a 14 percent approval rating. Republicans in Congress received especially low marks, with just 19 percent of Americans saying they view members of the political party positive compared to the 31 percent said the same of Democrats. Even though respondents said they view Democrats in higher regard, they were split on which party they want to represent them in Congress. The poll found that 44 percent of survey takers want Democrats to take charge of Congress, while 43 percent want Republicans at the helm. This month's poll wasn't all bad news for Congress, or Obama for that matter. While neither are particularly liked by Americans, they're not as unpopular as Russian President Vladamir Putin, who is . viewed favorably just four percent of Americans. Obama is also better liked that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin . 'Bibi' Netanyahu and Secretary of State John Kerry. Netanyahu and Kerry netted 24 percent and 33 percent positive ratings, respectively.

"This is the picture that could cost a pregnant woman in Sudan her life after she was sentenced to death for converting to Christianity to marry her husband. Mariam Yahya Ibrahim, 27, was charged with adultery for marrying a Christian man and has been ordered by the courts to abandon her newly adopted Christian faith and return to Islam. During yesterday's sentencing hearing Judge Abbas al Khalifa asked the pregnant mother-of-one whether she would return to Islam - but she refused. She said 'I am a Christian,' and the death sentence was handed down, judicial sources said. Scroll down for video . The wedding photo that has cost Sudanese woman Mariam Yahya Ibrahim her life after being sentenced to death for converting to Christianity. She is hoping to appeal the sentence . More than 50 people gathered outside the court where sentence was being passed on Mariam Yahya Ibrahim . After the verdict her husband, Daniel Wani told CNN: 'I'm so frustrated. I don't know what to do. I'm just praying.' A government spokesman said the ruling could be appealed in a higher court. Outside the court, around 50 people held up signs that read 'Freedom of Religion', while some Islamists celebrated the ruling, chanting 'God is Greatest.' The United States called on Sudan to respect the religious freedom guaranteed in its own constitution . People held up signs that read 'Freedom of Religion', while some Islamists celebrated the ruling, chanting 'God is Greatest' On February 7, Ms Ibrahim was arrested with her 20-month-old son, and put in a women’s prison. It is thought a relative had turned her in to the police for marrying a Christian. According to the Sudan’s Public Order Criminal Code, she is a Muslim by default because she was born in Sudan. Therefore, her marriage to a Christian is classed as a criminal act. On March 4, she was charged with adultery and apostasy. The adultery charge came with a punishment of 100 lashes and the apostasy charge came with a punishment of death. No remorse: Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's career has been defined by war. He came to power in a coup in 1989 and has ruled what was until this year Africa's largest country with an iron fist ever since . Mr Wani is not allowed to care for their child, Martin, because he is a Christian. Martin, who is almost two years old, is in prison with his mother. Mr Wani is not allowed to visit or see his son. Young Sudanese university students have mounted a series of protests near Khartoum University in recent weeks asking for an end to human rights abuses, more freedoms and better social and economic conditions in the country. The authorities decided on Sunday to close the university indefinitely. Uncertain future: Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has said he wants to adopt a '100 per cent' Islamic constitution now that the South has split off. The government says the new constitution will guarantee religious freedom, but many Christians are wary . Western embassies and Sudanese activists sharply condemned the accusations and called on the Sudanese Islamist-led government to respect freedom of faith. 'The details of this case expose the regime's blatant interference in the personal life of Sudanese citizens,' Sudan Change Now Movement, a youth group, said in a statement. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's government is facing a huge economic and political challenge after the 2011 secession of South Sudan, which was Sudan's main source of oil. A decision by Bashir last year to cut subsidies and impose austerity measures prompted violent protests in which dozens were killed and hundreds were injured.","Mariam Yahya Ibrahim has been sentenced to death for converting to Christianity to marry her Christian husband .

"The BBC has spent more than £220,000 on iPhone lessons for staff. Figures have revealed the corporation spent licence fee payers' money teaching 783 employees how to properly use the gadget over a period of three years.

Figures have revealed the corporation spent the money teaching 783 employees how to properly use the gadget over a period of three years . Earlier this year it was revealed that the BBC spent around £2.5million buying more than 4,000 iPhones, 400 iPads and 800 MacBooks for staff in the previous two years . But the BBC have pointed out that the figure for last year's training bill  - £42,000 - was the lowest so far, according to the figures released under a Freedom of Information request. Earlier this year it was revealed that the BBC spent around £2.5million buying more than 4,000 iPhones, 400 iPads and 800 MacBooks for staff in the previous two years. Andy Silvester, campaign manager for the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: It's absolutely incredible that the BBC has run up a bill of this size teaching staff to use mainstream technology. The BBC spent around £2.5million buying more than 4,000 iPhones, 400 iPads and 800 MacBooks for staff i . 'School teachers across the country know full well that teenagers can master an iPhone, so professionals should be able to. 'The BBC must cut out this kind of wasteful spending, or sympathy for the £145-a-year TV tax will continue to wane.' Presenters are regularly seen showing off their expensive Apple products on television - but the figures revealed thousands of off-screen staff are also getting hold of the gadgets. The Corporation have been buying iPhones at a rate of 200 a month for the last two years - shunning dozens of cheaper mobiles. In total, they bought 4,266 iPhones, 427 iPads and 815 MacBooks between January 2012 and October 2013, according to figures released to MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act. The number of iPads bought was relatively low because the BBC only started buying them for staff in December 2012 - and have been purchasing them at a rate of more than 40 a month since then, according to the latest full figures. The estimated cost of purchasing the Apple products is around £2.5million - based on standard retail prices although the BBC get a discount. However, the true cost of issuing staff with the gadgets will soar once the cost of mobile phone contracts with the Corporation's network operator O2 are taken into account. A spokesman for the BBC said that iPhones are only issued to staff who need them to do their jobs and they are not simply given out to all workers. They added: 'We are harnessing new technologies to train our journalists to use their phones to film, edit and transmit news stories on mobile phones. 'This not only keeps costs down for the licence fee payer but also increases our ability to work in remote places where there are no other means of broadcasting.'","783 employees taught how to use the gadget over a period of three years .

"The chief spokesman of Walmart has resigned after the supermarket giant discovered he lied about his college degree. David Tovar was forced out when the world's largest retailer found that the 40-year-old never graduated with an arts degree from the University of Delaware. According to an investigation by Bloomberg News, Tovar failed to get his diploma in 1996 and never finished the course work he started at the school. Resignation: David Tovar has left his position as chief spokesman for Walmart after the retail giant discovered he had lied about his college degree . He stepped down after eight years with Walmart and the former spokesman declined all requests to make a statement. A spokesman for the retailer told Bloomberg that it was up to Tover to 'speak to anything about his background.' According to the New York Post, Bloomberg discovered the lie while they were screening Tovar for another promotion. The fabrication of his degree was uncovered through this 'due-diligence screening.' Why Walmart only conducted a screening of Tovar now is unknown, however he joined Walmart with no problems in 2006 from tobacco giant Altria. Tovar came to national prominence earlier this year when he became involved in a spat with the New York Times' own Walmart Blog about a 'wildly inaccurate' column by Timothy Egan regarding the minimum wage. In March 2013, Tovar was arrested for failure to appear before an Arkansas county judge regarding a speeding ticket. The arrest had nothing to do with his dismissal this week . Giant: Walmart is the world's largest retailer and said it had no comment about the decision to let David Tolar go . In a poorly received move, Tovar uploaded a version of Egan's column covered in red pen that showed inaccuracies, as if marked by a school teacher. In an interview with CNBC, Tovar told the network that his resume omission was uncovered when he was being promoted to senior vice president. 'As part of that process I was going through additional leadership assessment, including a battery of tests including questions about leadership, drug tests, background checks,' he said to CNBC. 'In the background check my education was flagged—it was done by a third party company. They asked me about it, and I was 100 percent transparent. 'I got a job and never looked back. I really didn't think an art degree would matter in communications, which was the field I went into,' he said. Tovar said that whatever happens, he is not leaving Walmart under a cloud. 'Walmart said they could not promote me based on what they found. I said that the more senior job is the one that I wanted, so we agreed I would leave,' he said. 'I am leaving on good terms and Walmart has been very supportive. I am still here a few more weeks.'","David Tovar, 40, did not graduate in 1996 from University of Delaware .

"Scotland's traditional whisky distilleries are facing a spirited fight... from England . Scotland’s traditional whisky distilleries are facing a spirited fight... from England. Sales figures revealed by Marks and Spencer showed the chain’s Fine Single Malt English Whisky out-sold its new Scottish Single Malt by two to one during the Christmas period. Both bottles have been on sale for £35 - and the impressive performance of the English variety is being hailed as a ‘coup’ for the fledgling industry south of the border. Distillers believe a growing ‘English movement’ - as the Scots prepare to vote for independence - could have helped boost sales. M&S’s English Whisky is made by St George’s Distillery, in Roudham, Norfolk, which was set up in 2006 and is currently the only distillery in England - though several others are now being developed. Andrew Nelstrop, managing director of the English Whisky Company Limited, which runs St George’s Distillery, said he was ‘delighted’ at the sales figures. ‘We weren’t expecting to outsell Scottish whisky. It’s a very nice feeling,’ he said. ‘We produce a range of different whisky types, from the malty to the more heathery varieties. The one we did for M&S is a bespoke single malt with a bit of smoke, which is easy to drink. ‘These kind of sales show people aren’t just buying our whisky as a novelty to see what English whisky tastes like but must be coming back for second bottles - meaning it’s been well-received.’ Mr Nelstrop, a farmer before setting up his distillery, says the business is only ‘tiny’ compared with some of the Scottish distilleries - employing just two production and two office staff. But he said the industry is a ‘growing sector’. Sales figures revealed by Marks and Spencer showed the chain's Fine Single Malt English Whisky out-sold its new Scottish Single Malt by two to one during the Christmas period . ‘We were the first English distillery for 100 years but a second is just getting going elsewhere, and four more are being developed,’ Mr Nelstrop said. He added that the Scottish independence referendum may have encouraged some whisky drinkers south of the border to try his product instead. Emma Dawson, spirits buyer for M&S, said: ‘We are all about innovation and new offerings; an approach which is made possible by the confidence we have in our customers to be adventurous.’","Marks and Spencer Fine .

Shortly after writing the song Eleanor, 15, killed herself, tormented by pressures to be thinner and prettier and to get on with all her friends. Scroll down for video . Elle Holmes, 15, took her own life after pressures to be thinner and prettier and to get on with her friends . Leigh Holmes (centre) whose teenage daughter Elle (left)  died after a tragic accident has revealed that her daughter had been visiting pro-anorexia websites before her death . The lyrics of the song Mirror, Mirror . include the lines: ‘Mirror mirror don’t you see, What you show her is . deadly, You killed that little girl.’ Her family had no idea . anything  was wrong and say she must have  suddenly felt overwhelmed by . her worries and snapped. After her death they discovered that she had . secretly browsed sick ‘pro-ana’ websites – which promote anorexia and . bulimia – and had made herself sick after eating and had self-harmed in . the days before her death on May 26. Eleanor’s mother Leigh, 40, said . her daughter had shown ‘no sign’ of depression and was filmed laughing . in a family video hours before she died. ‘I don’t know why my loved, . brilliant, popular, talented, funny baby made that decision,’ said Mrs . Holmes, a teacher at an international school in China. ‘She left no . note. She said nothing to the little brother she adored. No word to her . boyfriend, or her close inner circle of friends. ‘There was no . long-suffering depression, or slow descent into despair. The spiral into . darkness seemed to occur over just a few short hours as her mind became . overwhelmed and she simply snapped.’ She added it was only through ‘forensically mining’ her daughter’s computer she discovered her hidden concerns. ‘Her . secret internet history revealed many of the pressures of modern life, a . desire to be skinnier, prettier, have different hair. There were secret . accounts on pro-ana websites,’ she said. Eleanor was a star student . with dreams of becoming a child psychologist. She had taken GCSEs a year . early, was captain of her school’s swimming, netball and football . teams, played three instruments and had volunteered helping orphans in . Tanzania. She wrote and performed her own songs, often accompanied on . the drums by brother Oliver, 13. Among them was Mirror, Mirror. On the . night of her death, Eleanor – who was also known as Elle – received . texts with a Gothic-style image of skulls and nooses from a friend and . sent texts asking whether another friend whom she had fallen out with . had ‘given up on her’. Mrs Holmes said: ‘Elle appears to have started . becoming distressed and began texting a friend, a blameless young . artist who also was exploring her own demons, who could not have known . the state of mind Elle was in from such short digital messages, carrying . none of the nuance or body language of a real conversation. ‘We can . only imagine what dark tunnels Elle’s mind took her down from there . onwards, but roughly two hours later, my wonderful baby died – leaving . me heartbroken.’ Elle loved to sing and recorded a track called Mirror Mirorr which the family hopes will become a world wide hit . Elle Holmes, from Bootle, Merseyside, had also been self-harming, covering her injuries with chunky accessories, her mother revealed. She was in Beijing at the time of her death . Before she died in May, Elle recorded a song that Ms Holmes now wants to share to bring hope to other youngsters struggling across the world and raise funds for teens in crisis . Mrs Holmes added: ‘Elle was a dream child: funny, . mischievous, caring about her family, committed and openly loving to her . mum and her little brother. But, clearly, she did have hidden demons. ‘If this could happen to my kid, it could happen to anyone.’ The . family live in China because Mrs Holmes works at the British School of . Beijing but are originally from Bootle, Liverpool. A Chinese inquest . found the cause of death to be asphyxiation. Mrs Holmes is now in . talks with singer Anita Prime from New Zealand to record a version of . Mirror, Mirror to help support girls struggling with their body image. The record will raise money for teenage mental health charity Papyrus. To donate in Eleanor’s memory visit: www.elleaholmes.com. Family . friend Sheree Brown wrote a blog warning parents of the dangers of . technology, especially in teenagers’ rooms at night. She said: ‘Mobile . devices and the such allow too much into what should be their “safe . place”.’ ■For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457909090, visit a local Samaritans branch or go to www.samaritans.org. ■For support and advice on battling eating disorders, contact b-eat: For the Adult Helpline, call 0845 634 1414.

"The number of MPs employing family  members has soared by nearly a fifth in a year. Despite fury over parliamentary . expenses, 155 MPs – nearly one in four – now have wives, children and . even parents on the public payroll. The relatives enjoy salaries as high as £50,000 for office duties – costing taxpayers £4million last year. Among senior Tories enjoying the perk are Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Chief Whip Sir George Young and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson. The latter two are millionaires and earn more than £130,000 a year. Michael Moore, the Liberal Democrat Scottish Secretary, employs his wife as a case worker. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (left) employs his wife as a senior secretary on £39,999, while Sir George Young, the Chief Whip, employs his daughter Camilla as a senior parliamentary assistant on £34,999 . The bill for MPs’ expenses rose by an inflation-busting 7 per cent despite David Cameron’s pledge to bring down the cost of politics. The 17 per cent rise in family employment reflects a rule change that allows MPs to spend more on staff and, by using relatives, top up their household income. In 2011/12 they were allowed to claim only £115,000 a year for staff. But that was increased in 2012/13 to £144,000 for London MPs to reflect higher costs in the capital. Other MPs claim up to £137,000. Expenses – office outlays and personal costs such as travel and accommodation – were up from £91.5million in 2011/12 to £98million, according to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (left) gave his wife Lynn as £39,999 role as his senior parliamentary assistant. Owen Paterson (right), Environment secretary, employs wife Rose in the same role . Spending is now higher than in the run-up to the expenses scandal of 2009. Matthew . Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Any politician using . taxpayers’ money to employ a relative must be completely open about who . is being paid, how much and for what. ‘And in the light of past abuses, they shouldn’t be surprised when their constituents demand more openness if they fail to give a detailed explanation as to how they are spending that cash.’ Nadine Dorries, the maverick Conservative MP, paid her daughters: Philippa up to £44,999 as an office manager and Jennifer up to £34,999 as senior secretary . The public outcry over MPs employing family members began in 2008, when Tory MP Derek Conway was accused of paying his two sons for non-existent jobs. Calls for the rules to be changed intensified after the expenses scandal broke a year later. Other ministers who employ relatives include Alistair Burt and Hugo Swire from the Foreign Office, business minister Michael Fallon, Stephen Hammond at the Department for Transport, and Northern Ireland minister Mike Penning. Analysis of the expenses claims made over the year 2012/13 show the largest was from Ian Paisley, DUP member for North Antrim. His claim was for £100,204 – largely due to travel costs. One MP – Tory Zac Goldsmith of Richmond Park – made no claim, while business minister Michael Fallon received just £38.74. Self-styled Tory leadership contender Adam Afriyie, Tory MP for Windsor, took home just £604.20. Nadine Dorries, the maverick Conservative MP, paid her daughters: Philippa up to £44,999 as an office manager and Jennifer up to £34,999 as senior secretary. Ipsa claimed it had saved the taxpayer £35million since taking over the expenses system in 2010. However, it used figures from two years before it started work – and before the expenses scandal – as a baseline. While the total allowances bill was £95.4million in 2008-09, it had already dropped to £90.7million by 2009/10. The figures come after the watchdog proposed lifting pay from £66,000 now to £74,000 after the 2015 general election.","Even though MP expenses are under scrutiny, family fill even more roles .

"Settled: Lisa Tchenguiz and Vivian Imerman's four-year-long battle is over - and she gets £15m . She was reportedly demanding £100million to divorce the drinks magnate known as The Man from Del Monte. But yesterday it was announced that film producer Lisa Tchenguiz, 48, will receive a fraction of that sum from Vivian Imerman. However, the £15million settlement . still amounts to more than £2million a year for the six years she was . together with one of Britain’s richest men, who sold the fruit juice . firm for £380million in 1999. However, legal fees for the four-year . dispute are estimated at around £5million for each side. The agreement brings to an end one of the country’s lengthiest and most bitter divorce battles, which went all the way to the Court of Appeal. It also led to a major change in the law, branded the ‘cheat’s charter’ because it gave wealthy men the right to hide assets from their wives. In a statement, Mr Imerman said that following negotiations, the pair had reached a ‘full and final settlement’ which he believed was in the ‘best interests of their daughter’. He added: ‘In order to avoid unnecessary, unfair and inaccurate speculation as to the terms of settlement and, given that such speculation has already found its way into the press, Mr Imerman confirms that he will pay a lump sum to Ms Tchenguiz of £15m in instalments, with no order for costs.’ He said his conduct had been ‘dignified’ throughout the proceedings and that he would not comment further, asking for his privacy to be respected. South African born Mr Imerman became known as ‘The Man from Del Monte’ after he sold a stake in the fruit juice firm for £380 million in 1999. He married Lisa Tchenguiz, the younger sister of property tycoons Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz in 2001 after she separated from Radio 1 disc jockey Gary Davies. The couple signed a pre-nuptial agreement which would have left her with nothing more than she came into the relationship with. But she asked for more because his fortune had increased in the time they were married. They separated in 2007 and in 2008 she petitioned for divorce after alleging he had been having an affair with his former wife. She sought £100million in what would have been the largest divorce settlement in British legal history at the time. Glamorous: The couple were married for seven years before Ms Tchenguiz filed for divorce in 2008 after alleging Mr Imerman had cheated on her with a former partner . On top of his fruit juice fortune, he made £396million in 2007 by selling the whisky group Whyte & Mackay. When . they split Mr Imerman, 58, was sharing a Mayfair office with her . brothers. Following the divorce petition, Robert Tchenguiz made . electronic copies of emails and other documents stored by Mr Imerman on . his office computer. He is thought to have downloaded between 250,000 and 2.5 million pages and claimed he was concerned to protect his sister’s interests, fearing Mr Imerman would try to hide his assets from his wife. But in 2010, he successfully argued that her side had no right to retain or use material downloaded without his knowledge. Divorce lawyers said the decision would mean wealthy men can hide their assets from their wives with impunity. A source close to Mr Imerman, who once stood at no 184 in Britain’s rich list, said: ‘He always wanted to give her something that was fair and reasonable’. It is understood that separate financial arrangements were made earlier to provide for their 10 year old daughter which were not subject of the divorce proceedings. She reportedly celebrated her 48th birthday last month at a party thrown by her American aircraft entrepreneur boyfriend Steve Varsano. The biggest divorce in English legal history is thought to be the £100million payout from oligarch Boris Berezovsky to his ex-wife Galina Besharova in 2011.","Liza Tchenguiz, 48 and Vivian Imerman ended four-year divorce battle .

"Hack: The details of at least 500,000 people were obtained by hackers in an apparent bid to blackmail the firm . One of Britain’s best-known and biggest providers of private cosmetic surgery has been targeted by computer hackers, it was revealed last night. Confidential personal details of nearly 500,000 people who made an enquiry about surgery via Harley Medical Group’s website were stolen in an apparent bid to blackmail the company. Patients interested in surgery are asked to fill in an online form ahead of an appointment, with details including phone numbers, email address and date of birth. That personal information was accessed and stolen in a security breach, the firm admitted in a letter to patients posted online. The company carries out a range of cosmetic surgery from breast augmentations and reductions to facelifts and tummy tucks. It boasts to potential customers on its website: ‘Our No 1 goal is to look after you.’ But Peter Boddy, chairman of the company that is based in Thames Ditton, Surrey, and has 31 clinics nationwide, was forced to write to clients apologising for the security breach. He reassured them that ‘clinical and financial information has not been compromised’. Mr Boddy wrote: ‘We recently became aware that an unknown individual had deliberately bypassed our website security, gaining access to information from initial website enquiries in an attempt to extort money from the company.’ Later, Harley Medical Group posted on Twitter: ‘We’re sorry details of initial enquiries have been accessed illegally and assure clinical and financial information is secure.’ The company said that it had improved its security. The hack targeted Harley Medical Group, which offers high end cosmetic treatment from facelifts to tummy tucks . Last night The Sun reported that Russian hackers were responsible. They claimed the crooks struck last month using a Russian email address to try and extort money from the firm and that stars of The Only Way is Essex, were among customers whose details were accessed. No one from Harley Medical Group was last night available to comment.","Information submitted to Harley Medical Group accessed by hackers .

"The attorney for an 18-year-old man featured laughing and joking over the fate of the alleged Ohio rape victim in a leaked YouTube video described the teenager's behaviour as, 'disappointing, insensitive and unfortunate' on Monday night. Speaking at a brief press conference Dennis McNamara sought to distance his client, Michael Nodianos, from the horrific events alleged to have taken place in Steubenville Ohio last August. Mr McNamara said, 'After some sober reflection he is ashamed and embarrassed himself. He's sorry to victims and his family. He was not raised to act in this manner.' It also emerged on Monday that Mr Nodianos has been forced to drop out of Ohio State University, where he was on athletic scholarship, after receiving numerous threats. Scroll down for video . Laughing: A video from the night of the alleged attack shows Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student, laughing callously and referring to a girl getting raped while she was reportedly drunk . Tension: Many in the community believe police have failed to fully investigate an allegation of rape. Two high school football players have been arrested following the alleged sex attack . Picking sides: Members of 'hacktivist' group Anonymous- seen wearing . their trademark masks- have taken on the Steubenville case because they . feel there is a police cover up protecting other people involved . Mr McNamara insisted that his client had not been in the house at the time of the alleged attack but had arrived as the girl was being taken out of the house. He claimed that his client's personal and Ohio State University email accounts have been hacked since the video was leaked and that his parents have been forced to change their telephone numbers after receiving death threats. 'There were people trying to find his class schedule at OSU, trying to access him there,' McNamara said. 'Some have even been at the dormitory during the fall term looking for him.' The Daily Beast reports that the freshman student was forced to drop out  because of the threats. Nearly 1,000 people gathered in the . small town of Steubenville, Ohio over the weekend to protest the . handling of an alleged gang rape where a teenage girl claims she was . sexually assaulted by two star football players. The case has sparked fury both in the . rural town and across the country as those involved have  effectively . been accused by social media, even though police have only arrested two . 16-year-old boys who were pictured carrying the alleged victim's limp . body on the night of the incident. The . backlash has echoes of the international outrage triggered by the death . of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh Pandey, who died as a result of the massive . injuries sustained during a brutal gang rape at the hands of six men in . Delhi, India. In Ohio, only two teens have been charged- Ma'lik Richmond and Trenton Mays - though many in the close-knit town believe that there is a cover up underway to keep more players from the beloved high school football team from being arrested. Over the weekend, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said officially that no further suspects would be charged. 'There was more than two kids involved. The kids who have money in this town have not been arrested,' demonstrator Lisa Waxler said. Beliefs like that have prompted defense attorneys to call for serious changes in the case before any trial takes place. Lawyer Walter Madison wants to move the trial to a different town because activists simply want to draw blood and have less concern for what is truly justified. Anger: Up to 1,000 people protested at Jefferson County Courthouse in Steubenville, Ohio, today. They believe local police have failed to fully investigate a 16-year-old's rape allegations to protect the local football program . Standoff: Deputies stand guard shortly after the sheriff announced there would be no more arrests in the case . 'What we have in this county is a legal lynching and I can't stand for that on my watch,' he told NBC. The party where the alleged rape took place dates back to August of last year- just before the school year began at Steubenville High School- but the case did not garner much national attention until recently. Horrible: This pictured, originally posted to Instagram, shows Ma'lik Richmond and Trent Mays carrying the seemingly lifeless body of the unidentified victim . A sect of the hacker group Anonymous took on the case and have scoured the internet for various photos and videos posted by students who were at one of the three parties that Richmond and Mays are said to have brought the allegedly unconscious victim, whose name has not been released due to her age and the sexual nature of the accusations. One of the most jarring pictures is that of the two teens carrying the girl by her ankles and wrists, which was posted to the photo-sharing application Instagram by another party attendee. The group, which arranged today's 'Occupy Steubenville' protest, also released a video that . showed several other young men joking about an assault. The sheriff, who said the protesters would not listen to his defense of the police, said there would be no . charges linked to the video, as it added no new evidence of any . crimes. 'I'm not going to stand here . and try to . convince you that I'm not the bad guy,' he said to a chorus of boos, . according to a Reuters report. 'You've already made your minds up.' Abdalla, who said he first saw the video three days ago, later . commented: 'It's a disgusting video. It's stupidity. But you can't . arrest somebody for being stupid.' Anonymous: The online activist group organized a protest in Steubenville yesterday. They accuse police of failing to thoroughly investigate an allegation of rape. County Sheriff Fred Abdalla, pictured left, defended officers yesterday, as hundreds, including many in the group's trademark masks, pictured right, demonstrated . Accused: Two 16-year-old members of the Steubenville Big Red football team are charged with rape. Protesters in the city yesterday said the police hadn't fully investigated the allegations in order to protect the team . Jyoti Singh Pandey, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, died in a Singapore hospital 13 days after being attacked as she made her way home from the movie theater in New Delhi. The brutal case has caused uproar in India, with mass demonstrations for women's rights, tougher rape laws and calls for the suspects in the case to be hanged. She and a male friend were attacked when they got in what they believed was a shared van. The five adult suspects appeared in court as the trial is due to start, and the youngest man involved is only 17-year-old so he faces charges in youth court. The leader of the protest in the close-knit city of Steubenville, just outside Pittsburgh, called on . victims of sexual assault to step forward, with several . people reacting, telling their stories to the crowd. Abdalla responded that he had dedicated his 28-year career to investigating such crimes and had arrested more than 200 suspects. Yesterday authorities launched a website they said would sought fact from fiction in the case. It has the . appearance of a legal briefing, with black type on a white background, . providing an intentional departure from escalating emotions over the . case and how it's been handled. 'This site is not designed to be a forum for how the Juvenile Court ought to rule in this matter,' the site declares. The . website provides a timeline of the case, summaries of Ohio laws that . affect sex charges, online posts and reaction to them, facts about the . local police force and a pledge of transparency. Public . interest in the case increased this week with circulation online of the . unverified video, featuring Mr McNamara's client and more than 12 minutes long, that purportedly shows . another young man joking about a sexual assault. Ohio Attorney General Mike . DeWine called the posting 'despicable' but agreed it didn't constitute . new evidence for local investigators, who were aware of it before the . posting. The accused two students will be tried as juveniles on February 13. The sheriff has also come under fire for . leaving the case with local police and refusing to revisit the . original investigation. 'People have got their minds made up,' he told the news agency. 'A case like this, who . would want to cover any of it up?'.

"It is one of the wealthiest streets in the world and you could get your hands on one of the sought-after properties... if you have a spare £65million in the bank. Dubbed 'Bilionaire's Row', Bishops Avenue, in Hampstead, north London is home to Saudi princes, members of the Brunei Royal Family, entrepreneurs and celebrities. But today a new generation of multi-millionaires are preparing to move in snapping up the chance to get their feet on the super-rich property ladder as a number of houses have come on to the market. For sale: Carlton House in Bishops Avenue is currently on the market for offers over £15million. The Saudi Royal Family have just sold 10 of their properties in the street for a reported £80million . The tree-lined street connects the north side of Hampstead Heath at Kenwood to East Finchley. Bishops Avenue lies on the boundary of the London boroughs of Barnet and Haringey. The street is named after Bishops Wood which runs through the avenue. It was historically owned by the Bishop of London until the Church of England sold most of the land in the 20th Century. Many of the houses are inspired by the designs of ancient Greece and Rome, while others draw inspiration for traditional English country estates. In the 1980s average property prices exceeded the £1million mark. In 2006 the smallest houses were selling for £5million. In 2008 one of the most prestigious addresses, Toprak Mansion, sold for £50million - making it one of the most expensive homes in the world. The road is mentioned in Elton John's 1988 reworking of Give Peace A Chance, 'Why not talk about Bishop's Avenue,' and 'I've got a lovely house on Bishop's Avenue.' For many of the residents, such is the size of their wealth, that they rarely spend time living in their extravagant mansions. Focusing on expanding their property empires the wealthy home owners rarely sell up, leaving it difficult to get hold of one of the 66 mansions in the street. But in recent months the Saudi Arabian Royal family is understood to have sold 10 houses in Bishops Avenue. And property website Zoopla currently has . 28 homes in the street listed for sale ranging in price from . £1.9million to £65million - an average of £15million per home. The Times reported the Saudi Royal family's properties have been sold to LJ Capital for around £80million. The houses, most of which have never . been lived in, sit on a five-acre estate, which LJ Capital plans to . develop into a luxury mansion and apartment complex. Trevor Abrahmsohn, of Glentree . Estates, who has sold many houses on the avenue, told the Times: 'The . Bishops Avenue is a cross between a country estate and a town residence. 'The prince can live next to the pauper here as there is such a spread of (house) values from £100million down to £1million. 'Bishops Avenue is so interesting that if it didn't exist you would have to invent it.' For sale: Property website Zoopla currently lists 28 properties in the street for sale. This nine-bedroom mansion can be yours for a mere £34million . Mansion: The sprawling home features nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a ballroom, swimming pool, gym, steam and sauna rooms . Ancient inspiration: Many of the mansions are inspired by the buildings of ancient Greece and Rome, while others were built in the style of traditional English country estates . Vast homes: In the late 1980s the price of homes in Bishops Avenue exceeded £1million. Today the largest homes fetch £65million upwards while apartments can be snapped up for a cheaper £1.9million . Average property prices in the street surpassed the £1million in the late 1980s and each home sits in a two to three acre plot. In 2006 the smallest houses in the . road were regularly selling for around £5million, while one of the  most . opulent residences, 30,000sq ft Toprak Mansion was sold by Turkish . tycoon Halis Toprak amid great secrecy to the President of Kazakhstan, . Nursultan Nazarbayev. The . property sold for £50million in January 2008 - making it one of the most . expensive houses in the world, according to Forbes magazine. The . avenue is named after Bishops Wood, which runs through it, and was . formerly owned by the Bishop of London following a land grant in 704. In . 1894 the Church of England allowed for the construction of homes on the . road and in the 20th Century much of the land was sold off by the . Church. Today, just one house on the road - 46 Bishops Avenue - and a nearby residential home are owned by the Church. Billionaire's Row: The street, which lies between Hampstead and East Finchley in north London is believed to be one of the wealthiest in the world . Wealthiest neighbourhood: Bishops Avenue lies between Hampstead Heath and East Finchley in north London .

Meanwhile down the road a nine-bedroom white-washed house, featuring a distinctive green roof is on the market for £34million. The newly-extended and refurbished mansion sits in grounds of 0.75 acres and includes a detached guest house. Lifestyle of the rich and famous: The Sultan of Brunei, left, owns a number of properties in Bishops Avenue, while Heather Mills, right, once owned an apartment in the street .

"Oprah Winfrey insisted that she WAS a victim of racism and she experienced what 'people of black or brown color experience daily', in an interview with a Swiss newspaper published today. Oprah, one of the world's richest women, revealed on Entertainment Tonight last week that she felt discriminated against when a sales assistant in a luxury Zurich Boutique refused to show her a $38,000 handbag designed by Tom Ford and named after Jennifer Aniston.

Switzerland happened only once before in my life. 'So . I didn't want to indict Switzerland. It was a single incident. An . incident that people of black or brown color experience daily. She even added that she was tempted to call her friends Ford or Aniston as she stood in the store. 'That damn bag': Oprah said that if she had known the cost of the bag when she asked to see it - she probably would have thought it was too expensive . 'Snub': Oprah said in the interview that shop assistants 'usually . rejoice when she enters a store', owned by Trudie Goetz, above. Oprah . added: 'People usually press their noses flat against the windows to see . me shopping' 'It . was however uncommon for that to happen to me. Believe me, usually . sales people rejoice when I come to them in their business. It is very . unusual that I'm not really involved when in a boutique. Outside, people . usually press their noses flat against the windows to see me shopping.' Oprah . had claimed in the original Entertainment Tonight that the Italian-born sales . assistant refused to show her the crocodile leather bag, the suggestion being, . she implied, that as a black woman she could not afford it. The . incident happened at the Trois Pommes Boutique in Storchengasse, a . street behind the ritzy Bahnhofstrasse in Zurich, one of the world's . wealthiest and most expensive cities. Oprah . was invited to be a guest in July at the wedding of soul singer Tina . Turner in Switzerland and wanted a handbag to compliment her outfit. She . went on: 'I was the only person in the store. I had dressed myself up . extra special because I know that things can get very snobby in these . kinds of stores. 'The . employees first check out what clothes you're wearing. Therefore I chose . a Donna Karan outfit - and even washed my hair even. So nobody could . mistake me for a homeless person who got lost in the store. 'The . woman did not want to get down the bag which I wanted to look at. The . effort was too much for her. She said to me, that the bag was simply too . expensive. And I said: ""I want to see it anyway.""  Instead she tossed . me cheaper bags. 'I said: ""Okay, thank you very much!  But I really want to see the others.""  She still kept showing me the cheaper ones. Friends: Oprah said she felt like calling Tom Ford - who designed the bag - or Jennifer Aniston - who it was named after, as she stood there in the store . Touchy: Oprah denied claims that she was being 'over-sensitive' about race after the incident at the upmarket store in Zurich, above . 'To . be honest, if I had known upfront what this damned bag cost, do you . know what? The woman was right: I would not have bought the thing - far . too expensive! Too expensive! $38,000! I would have fainted when I saw . the price tag.' She . continued: 'The saleslady said it was the Jennifer Aniston bag that was . created by Tom Ford for Jennifer.  The idea went through my head that I . should call Jennifer or Tom - I know them both very well. Instead I said . to the saleslady: ""Okay, I understand. The bag is just for Jennifer, . and only she is allowed to buy it, right? 'The . woman said ""no, no"" and tried to explain something. But I was no longer . listening. I just said: ""Thank you very much, you're probably right . that I can't afford it."" 'I . went. I didn't want to make a scene. Really not. That's why it annoys me . now too, that it has become this major international story. And that . the names of Tom Ford and Jennifer Aniston were pulled in too. The whole . thing is really quite annoying.' She . acknowledges the apologies of the owner Trudie Goetz and the anonymous . saleslady but added: 'But I don't know whether the apology brings . something. Discrimination is there, anywhere around the world, every . day. As I said, I did not want to bring the whole of Switzerland into . disrepute. 'Perhaps she . never wanted to reach for the bag because it was too high up. Does . anyone know? Anyway, I had a great time in Switzerland. My friend Tina . Turner got married, I went for a walk every day. It's a pity that such a . big deal is now being made out of this other thing.' The . publication of the frank interview will do nothing to quell the war of . words currently raging between the TV talk show queen and Goetz. Yesterday . Goetz said she wanted to speak personally to Winfrey and defended her . employee to the hilt, adding: ‘I don't know why she talked of racism.  I . am sorry, but perhaps she is being a little over-sensitive here.  Maybe . she was somewhat offended because she was not immediately recognized in . the store.'

"Turkey's courts blocked access to Twitter today following Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's vow, on . the campaign trail ahead of key March 30 local elections, to 'wipe out' the service. In a defiant stand, Mr Erdogan said he did not care what the . international community had to say about the move. 'Twitter, mwitter!,' he told thousands of supporters at a rally, in a phrase translating roughly as 'Twitter, schmitter!' 'The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is,' he said. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan banned Twitter today. He said he did not care about the reaction of the international community . Links on social networks have proliferated linking to recordings that appear to incriminate the Prime Minister and other top officials in corruption. This computer screen shows blocked access to Twitter last week . Yet some have ready found a way of getting around the ban by using Google's DNS tool. The tool allows internet users to browse from another domain name system. A DNS transforms the name of a website into a series of numbers known as an IP address. Twitter users in Turkey have now begun circulating the alternative DNS address 8.8.8.8 on social media. Graffiti with the words has also appeared on a wall in the country. A logo with the Twitter symbol and the words #DirenTwitter and its English translation #OccupyTwitter has also gone viral. The Prime Minister, who . has been in power for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that . has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government . wrongdoing. Links on social networks have . proliferated linking to recordings that appear to incriminate the Prime . Minister and other top officials in corruption. Street graffiti in Turkey with the DNS code that allows internet users to access Twitter . A campaign opposing the Twitter ban went viral in Turkey. These posters contain the alternative DNS address for Twitter from a computer in Turkey as well as the hashtag which has gone viral. #Turkey was trending today on the social media website . Turkey has blocked access to . YouTube in the past but this is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in . the country. The social network was instrumental in organizing flash protests against . the government last year. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government's reputation ahead of local elections this month. Despite the ban, tech-savvy users managed to tweet links to the recordings on Friday. President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan's, was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. Turkish President Abdullah Gul has blasted the ban and continued tweeting from his page today . President Gul said that it was unacceptable to impose complete bans on social media platforms such as Twitter. 'I hope this implementation won't last long,' he wrote. 'One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,' Mr . Gul tweeted. He said only individual Internet pages should be blocked if . there is a court order on the grounds that a person's privacy is being . violated. Mr Gul co-founded the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party with Erdogan and has . remained a close ally. But he is viewed as a more conciliatory figure . than the combative Prime Minister and their relations have at times . appeared strained. Mr Erdogan's ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, . handed government more influence over the courts, and reassigned . thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights a . corruption scandal he has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust . him. Many - although not all - users trying to access the network early on Friday instead saw a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing four court orders. The site was blocked early this morning in Turkey . Turkey's lawyers' association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey's main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation. Twitter's (at)policy account earlier sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or ""SMS."" It was unclear how those tweets would be viewable. Telecoms . watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the . courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching . privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove . content. 'Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was . blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future . victimization of citizens,' it said. European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey - a country that is seeking to join the European Union - as 'groundless, pointless, cowardly.' Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned. Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications in Turkey, said his office was merely obeying court orders. President Abdullah Gul continued using Twitter despite the ban. His last Tweet was sent at 9.35am . Chancellor Angela Merkel's government criticised Turkey saying the ban did not fit with Germany's view of freedom of expression. 'What we are hearing from Turkey does not comply with what we in Germany understand as free communication,' said Mrs Merkel's spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz. 'It doesn't fit with our idea of freedom of expression to forbid or block any form of communication,' she added. Links to the leaked recordings have been popping up on Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Mr Erdogan's instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Mr Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government ahead of the March 30 elections. The original source of the recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news report that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge. In response to the Twitter ban in Turkey, Dr Paul Dwyer, social media expert from the University of Westminster, said: 'President Erdogan said, when he attempted to close down access to Twitter, ‘everyone will see how powerful Turkey is’. 'In fact, of course, he has simply demonstrated how powerful Twitter is. 'Social media are a part of politics - and everything else we do. And so we must learn to use them well and for good, otherwise we will find ourselves, as President Erdogan now does, out of touch with the modern world.' This afternoon, Britain issued a warning to Turkey over the ban. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are concerned about reports suggesting that access to Twitter from Turkey may be blocked. Social media has a 'vital role to play in a modern democracy' and promotes transparency and public debate, the spokesman said. As a candidate EU country, which had been 'long-supported' by the UK it is vital for Turkey to express values of freedom of expression and democracy, the Foreign Office warned.","The site was banned this morning in Turkey .

"A lawyer who suggested convicted rapist Ched Evans could be innocent has defended his views after they were removed from the website on which they were first published. The Professional Footballers' Association of Ireland's solicitor Stuart Gilhooly, who also said the former Sheffield United striker deserves a second chance even if he is guilty, detailed his views in an article posted on the association's website. Gilhooly's comments were removed on Tuesday morning and while he insisted he had no problem with the decision, he stood by the views. Ched Evans and his fiancée Natasha Massey, who has stood by him, near their Cheshire home last week . Evans put a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name . A lawyer from the Professional Footballers' Association of Ireland has said Evans is 'being treated like the Guildford Four' in an article which describes the convicted rapist's crime as 'alleged' He said: 'It was not taken down at my behest, but was removed with my consent and I have no difficulty with the PFA Ireland's decision to do so. 'The article reflected my opinion of the situation and did not seek to represent the views of the PFA Ireland or its members. I stand over its contents.' Stephen McGuinness, general secretary of the PFAI, confirmed that it had been the association's decision to remove the article from the website. McGuinness said: 'We decided to take it down, it was our decision. We decided to take it down this morning as soon as we came in. Singer Paul Heaton (left) became the fourth high-profile Sheffield United patron to resign over the ongoing row, while Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would ask for her name to removed from the club's ground if Evans returns . The stand was re-named in Ennis-Hill's honour after her 2012 Olympic triumph . 'The decision was not at the behest of Stuart, it was our decision to take it down.' In the article, Gilhooly argued that Evans, who was released last month after serving half of a five-year jail sentence following his conviction for the rape of a 19-year-old woman in Rhyl, North Wales, deserves a chance of redemption. The player has always maintained his innocence despite being found guilty. Gilhooly wrote: 'This crime, as alleged, was at the bottom end. There was no violence and thankfully the victim has no recollection of it. This, I hasten to add, does not make it right, or anything close to it, but it is nonetheless a mitigating factor.' Heaton's decision to quit his post follows the examples of TV's Charlie Webster (left) and singer Dave Berry . Businesswoman Lindsay Graham also left her role at the Yorkshire club since Evans returned to training . He added: 'It's not easy to muster up too much sympathy for Evans, but there is surely nothing worse than being accused of a crime which you genuinely believe you didn't commit. 'The argument against that is that a jury convicted him of the crime. The same applied to the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. They got no public sympathy either. 'Maybe he is guilty or perhaps he's innocent, none of us knows for sure. Surely, either way, he deserves a chance at redemption. Don't we all?' Evans' attempts to resume his career have been met by protests, with musician Paul Heaton resigning on Monday as a patron of Sheffield United's Community Foundation over the Blades' decision to allow Evans to train with the club. TV presenter Charlie Webster, sixties pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham have all resigned as patrons of the club, while Olympic athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to removed from a stand at Bramall Lane if Evans returns to play for the team. An appeal against Evans's conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Case Review Commission.","Solicitor Stuart Gilhooly referred to crime as 'alleged' despite conviction .

"Miguel Angel Jimenez leads the inaugural True Thailand Classic by a shot after Friday's second round. The veteran Spaniard, who was struggling with illness, carded a six-under-par 66 to go with his 67 on Thursday, leaving him a stroke ahead of Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat. He signed for a 67 to move into the thick of the contention, but remains in the shadow of Jimenez overall, and it would have been a bigger deficit were it not for the European's last-hole bogey. Miguel Angel Jimenez takes a single shot lead heading into the third round of the True Thailand Classic . The Spaniard, pictured on day one, has hit rounds of 67 and 66 despite suffering from a heavy cold . 'I'm very happy. I am disappointed to make bogey on the last but overall I played very solid and made a lot of birdies. You're always happy when you're under par - and the more under par you are, the happier you are,' said Jimenez on the tournament's official website. 'I have a heavy cold and I'm very bunged up and slept terribly last night, but apart from that I'm fine.' Three players are tied for third, with Richard Lee, Scott Hend and home favourite Thongchai Jaidee on nine under. Local Kiradech Aphibarnrat is a shot behind the leader after hitting a second round 67 . England's Tom Lewis is three shots off the lead on eight under after a 67, with compatriot Matthew Baldwin and Northern Ireland's Michael Hoey - the overnight leader - tied alongside him on the same score. Thailand's Panuphol Pittayarat missed the cut but goes home with a new luxury townhouse worth close to £225,000. His hole in one on the par-three 14th means he picked up the prize as a reward.","Miguel Angel Jimenez has one-shot lead after second round in Thailand .

"Families will no longer have to switch tariffs to cut their power bills the government announced  today - but the changes will not come in for almost two years. Under plans unveiled today, energy firms will be forced to move customers on to their best deals automatically, as David Cameron promised last month. Each supplier is also expected to be restricted to only four tariffs for electricity and four for gas, but the reforms will only become compulsory in summer 2014. David Cameron today boasted about his energy bills plan ahead of a Q&A session at the Nacco Materials Handling factory, near Portadown, Co Armagh . The Prime Minister used Twitter to claim he had defied claims by the Labour party that his plan could not be delivered . The Prime Minister caught officials off guard when he made the pledge to force firms to give customers to lowest price. But . today he used Twitter to boast that he was true to his word: 'My . promise to ensure energy customers get the lowest tariff is being . delivered, despite Labour saying it couldn't be done.' Energy Secretary Ed Davey set out details of the plans . to simplify and slash the number of tariffs from the bewildering 500 on . offer. Critics warned the move could limit . choice and see some of the cheapest deals for savvy customers who shop . around disappear altogether. Mr Davey said: 'I am determined . to ensure all consumers get a better deal on their energy bill and get . the cheapest tariff they can. 'Bill payers will no longer face the . impossible choice between hundreds of tariffs; each customer will have a . maximum of four tariffs for gas or electricity per supplier to . consider.' Households will . be able to demand detailed information about their energy use which they . can use to shop around, using price comparison websites or mobile phone . apps. Mr Davey added: 'For too long people have been stuck . on the wrong type of energy tariff, paying more than they need to. Our . new proposals will make things much clearer and easier to understand, so . that bill payers can get the best deal and feel the benefit in their . pockets.' As many as seven in ten households pay over the odds for power – some by as much as £300 a year. Officials . said they want all customers on the cheapest price available from their . supplier 'as quickly as possible and, at the latest, by summer 2014'. Last night, a Downing Street . spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister said we would legislate to offer . people the lowest tariff available and that is what’s going to happen. The cost of living is an issue close to his heart.’ The Prime Minister promised action to . rein in the ‘Big Six’ energy suppliers – only to see prices soar by up . to 11 per cent this autumn. Bills have risen by £200 in two years . to a record high of £1,300 and regulator Ofgem has called for simpler . tariffs to try to halt the trend.  It is hoped that clearer charges will allow customers to compare deals offered by rival suppliers. Ofgem’s chief executive Alistair . Buchanan said: 'These proposals - based on Ofgem’s Retail Market Review . (RMR) - will put an end to consumers being bamboozled by complex tariffs . and deliver choice that consumers easily understand. Energy Secretary Ed Davey set out plans to slash the number of tariffs . 'We are also proposing much simpler information for consumers such as making suppliers give consumers their cheapest tariff on their bill. Ofgem is also going to enforce fair treatment of consumers using licence standards backed by fines.' Research by comparison firm uSwitch . has found households can save £135 by choosing a cheaper tariff from . their supplier, or up to £300 by switching to a different provider. Tom . Lyon, energy expert at uSwitch, said: 'Simplifying tariffs and the . market for consumers is a good thing. Giving consumers all the tools . they need to select the best deal for their needs will give competition . the kiss of life that it needs. 'However, . we would be deeply concerned if the Government does go a leap further . and insists that suppliers put all their customers on their cheapest . deal – this would kill competition stone dead and could result in . everyone paying higher prices in the long run.' When . Mr Cameron made the tariff pledge last month he was accused of paving . the way for an ‘energy shambles’ that would destroy competition and . drive up bills. But consumer groups have welcomed the Government’s proposals. Richard . Lloyd, of Which?, said: ‘We want the Prime Minister to stick to what he . promised and to force energy companies to give the lowest tariff to . their customers.’ Ann . Robinson, of uSwitch, said the proposals appeared to be a ‘good step . forward’. She said simpler tariffs would help customers to shop around. Struggling: Mr Bentley's potential windfall would be enough to pay a typical family's gas and electricity bill for 9,500 years . However, today there were warnings the move will mean fewer low-price deals. Guy Newey, head of energy and environment at centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange, said: 'Cutting the number of tariffs and forcing energy companies to put households on the ‘best’ rate could end cheap deals. This risks punishing families who do the right thing and shop around.' Angela Knight, chief executive of EnergyUK which represents energy firms, added: 'If that’s what the Government wants then that is fine. What it will do is it will remove some choice away from people, and certainly some deals that people get at the moment.' Ms Knight added that much of the costs which make up household bills are linked to global fuel prices which are 'outside the control of anybody'. 'There’s a very significant proportion of your bill which relates to such things as what people have to pay for upgrading the works, the pipes, the network, and what people are paying as well for such things, we refer to them as obligations, the requirements placed on the major companies to insulate homes,' she told BBC Radio 4. 'That can add up to about half your bill. So what we’re talking about is only part of the bill, and that part of the bill that we’re talking about the majority of it is affected by whatever the world price is of energy and particularly of gas.' Corin Taylor, Senior Economic Adviser at the Institute of Directors (IoD), warned: 'These reforms miss the point when it comes to reducing energy bills. Clumsy regulation restricting choice would simply allow energy companies to increase their lowest tariff, ensuring a higher minimum price for consumers.' Greenpeace Energy Campaigner Louise Hutchins said: 'The Government can tinker with the tariff system all it likes, but until Britain reduces its reliance on volatile world gas markets, even the cheapest tariff will keep rising.' Public outcry: Bills have risen by £200 in two years to a record high of £1,300 . Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy spokesman, warned that suppliers might now offer fewer but more expensive tariffs. 'David Cameron is trying to pull the wool over people’s eyes. The Prime Minister promised to force the energy companies to put everyone on the cheapest tariff and he has broken his promise. 'All the Government is really doing is . reducing the number of tariffs on offer. If energy companies are only . allowed to offer one tariff for every type of contract, that’s not the . lowest tariff – it’s the only tariff.' Since last month SSE, British Gas, Npower and Scottish Power have hiked their prices. EDF will raise prices by a massive 10.8 per cent from December and E.On is expected to follow suit in January. Consumer Focus said last month it would welcome any attempt to ‘make the energy market clearer and simpler’ to help vulnerable groups such as the elderly who are least likely to switch. However the statutory group urged the Prime Minister to address customers’ concerns about the relationship between wholesale costs and retail prices. E.ON, SSE, Npower and British Gas have all already taken measures to cut the number of core tariffs they offer, following recommendations from Ofgem and the Prime Minister last month. E.ON is on four, SSE three, British Gas six and Npower eight. Last week a whistle-blower exposed the apparent rigging of Britain’s £300billion wholesale gas market by City traders. The Government's plans to improve the lot of energy consumers remain a far way off. In the meantime, you continue to do an annual check on your deal to ensure it is the cheapest. If you haven't switched supplier for a few years, you could save hundreds of pounds a year by moving to the lowest tariff. The saving could be as much as £300 annually. Most of the major suppliers are currently hiking prices ahead of winter - SSE, which trades as Southern Electric, SWALEC and Atlantic Energy -  was last month the first to up its prices in the latest round and the largest operator, British Gas, followed suit last Friday. The best starting point is to read the round-up on This is Money, MailOnline's sister website, which highlights the best tariffs, or just do a quick search on your postcode - deals vary in different regions - using the tool on the right.","Government sets out detail of David Cameron's surprise pledge to ensure home owners are on the lowest tariff .

"England are ready for another ‘cup final’ at Twickenham on Saturday, but they are aware of the need for patience despite the expectation of a big win over Italy. Stuart Lancaster’s national team will go into the second instalment of their RBS Six Nations campaign on the back of an impressive 21-16 victory over Wales in Cardiff. They have never lost to their next opponents, but a close encounter in the same fixture two years ago has helped to sharpen English minds and guard against any hint of complacency this week.

England head coach Stuart Lancaster (front) surveys the scene at Twickenham on Friday . The England coaches are confident that their players will have the right mind-set for their next encounter. Andy Farrell said: ‘All you can deal with is preparation and making sure that mentally and emotionally you're in the right place. That's important for tomorrow (Saturday) as well as last week. ‘To win a championship you have five of those cup finals. Emotionally and mentally you have to make sure you're in the right place to put that plan on the field, to have a feel for the game as it's unfolding and do the right thing accordingly. ‘We've had a good week. Earlier in the week we showed them what they did well, what they didn't do well. Mentally we brought them down a bit and then built them back up again.

Ben Youngs (left) passes the ball while being watched on by his England team-mates . Lancaster and his coaches Graham Rowntree (centre) and Andy Farrell (right) watch on . In the last two years, England have finished runners-up in the Six Nations table on points difference, but Farrell claimed that the home team cannot afford to go into the match thinking about the winning margin. ‘International rugby is not like that, you just have to look at the recent games between us,’ he said. ‘Two of the last three games have been close. ‘The game always takes its own way. What we have to do is be good enough to feel the momentum of the game and how to influence it. The performance will come on the back of that really. 'To have a fixed plan of how it will unfold in your head before the game isn't reality. If Italy turn up and play exceptionally well, it will be a really tough game, there's no doubt about that. ‘We just need to try and influence our game on them early to try and get what we want from it. We'd have loved to have beaten Wales by 30 points last week. We'd love to have beaten Ireland (last year) by a lot of points as well. Each game is different and it's all swings and roundabouts.’ Fly half George Ford practices his kicking on Friday as he prepares for action . Jonathan Joseph rises to catch the high ball during the England captain's run at Twickenham . Lancaster, the head coach, suggested earlier in the week that England have more ‘X-factor’ players at their disposal than at any time before in his tenure.

Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina, who joined from Nice in the summer, has taken Szczesny's place . Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey (right) has a 'grade one' hamstring injury, claims Arsene Wenger . Ramsey (left) was replaced by Mathieu Flamini after pulling his hamstring for the third time this season . Wenger also believes there is an underlying reason for Aaron Ramsey's continuing injury travails - but Arsenal are yet to find it. The Wales midfielder was a substitute for Tuesday night's Premier League victory over Leicester, but was replaced after only nine minutes due to a hamstring problem and now looks set to spend more time on the sidelines. 'We haven't found the underlying reason,' said Wenger, speaking ahead of the holders' FA Cup clash with Middlesbrough on Sunday. Alexis Sanchez (pictured) was also injured during Arsenal's 2-1 victory against Leicester on Tuesday . Sanchez injured his knee following a collision with Leicester defender Matthew Upson . 'There is an underlying reason that is medical or bio-mechanical, because he's a guy who is serious, works hard. 'There's no obvious reason why he should have muscular injuries.' Wenger played down the severity of the problem which is expected to keep Ramsey out for a fortnight and insisted Arsenal's training methods are sound. 'It's not a major injury. It's a grade one,' he added. 'We have individualised training. I don't think that is any special case that has been neglected.'

"The wind was blowing in a different direction for England at Edgbaston on Monday when Jos Buttler appeared to become a genuine contender for next week’s first Test just two days after his captain had ruled him out. At Lord’s on Saturday, Buttler produced the fastest one-day international hundred by an Englishman against the best white-ball bowling attack in the world, but Alastair Cook was quick to play down his Test series chances. That appeared to be contradicted by England coach Peter Moores on the eve of Tuesday’s deciding match of the Royal London series even though he also made it clear that Matt Prior, who scored 30 for Sussex  before being trapped lbw by Stuart Broad, was still the favourite to play ahead of Buttler next week. ‘Jos played a brilliant innings at Lord’s and to be there and see it was great,’ said Moores, who has the opportunity  today to get his second coming  as England coach off to a victorious start. Keeping tabs: Jos Buttler remains in the picture for England's Test series against Sri Lanka . ‘Jos isn’t the finished article as a keeper but he’s improving quickly and often people aren’t fully developed when they  start. He’s a rapidly improving  cricketer and that doesn’t shock me because I think he’s a highly talented lad. Nothing is set in stone and we don’t want to put ceilings on people. ‘It was great to see him play like that and we’ll talk when we sit down as selectors about whether that’s enough to get him in the Test team. Jos has certainly pushed his name forward.’ So was Cook being overly conservative when he said, in the immediate aftermath of Buttler’s 121 off 74 balls, that he was not yet ready with bat or gloves, a view that was subsequently echoed by the batsman-keeper himself? ‘I know he didn’t mean to take anything away from the innings,’ said Moores of Cook. ‘He wants Jos to get full credit for that. We know we have some key decisions to make ahead of the first Test and it’s good to see Matt Prior back. Centurion: Buttler scored a stunning ton during the fourth ODI at Lord's on Saturday . Ready? Alastair Cook suggested that the 23-year-old may not be ready for Test cricket just yet . ‘The medics will have a say on how Matt’s achilles is after the Sussex match but he has done a lot of work building it up. We wouldn’t want to go into a game thinking there’s a chance our keeper wouldn’t get through it, but if Matt’s fit, he’s a strong contender.’ It has been felt since Buttler came into the one-day side that his keeping is some way from Test standard and part of the reason why he left Somerset last winter to join Lancashire was, ironically, to improve his glovework with Moores. That has not happened at county level because of Moores’ subsequent elevation to become England coach again but Buttler is still at the stage, as Prior was when he first played Test cricket, of having some way to go with the gloves. Yet Buttler is clearly a special talent and there are echoes here of when Kevin Pietersen came into the one-day team and made a huge impact in a  50-over series in South Africa at the start of 2005. It was said then that his game was not yet suited to Test cricket but England took the plunge with him at the start of the Ashes that year and he quickly justified Duncan Fletcher’s judgment. Differing views: Peter Moores said Buttler remains in the picture for the Sri Lanka Test series . Sceptical: England captain Alastair Cook suggested that Buttler was not ready for Test cricket . It was no surprise to see Pietersen among those advocating Buttler for Test cricket on Twitter, not least because he and Prior do not get on, but England will have to decide whether they can hold back such a gifted stroke-maker any longer in the ultimate game, rough edges or not. The most gifted gloveman of them all, James Foster of Essex, is clearly very much in the selectors’ thoughts as an alternative to Prior but the selectors will decide when they meet on Wednesday whether Buttler has done enough to leapfrog him. For now they want to win today’s final one-day international in Birmingham which Moores says, with the series level at 2-2, they will treat as a cup final on an Edgbaston ground where England lost last year’s Champions Trophy final to India under Ashley Giles. ‘It would be lovely to win this game,’ said Moores. ‘We’ve got a World Cup coming up and there will be lots of big games in that so we will treat this as a final. We’ve shown we can beat Sri Lanka but so far we haven’t put the complete game together. I’m confident if we play well we have a pretty good chance.’ Different ball game: Sri Lanka's players show off their football skills during a training session at Edgbaston . No laughing matter: Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews enjoys himself during a net session . The former Lancashire coach then expressed caution about the extraordinary comeback of Andrew Flintoff to his old county, which is expected to see the all-rounder play in the Twenty20 Roses match at Old Trafford on Friday. ‘It’s a sensitive issue with the players who are there,’ said Moores. ‘It’s got to be handled right. A fit, strong Andrew  Flintoff will add to any side  but Lancashire are playing really good cricket at the moment so you’d think it would be difficult to get him in. In the end it’s got to be a cricketing decision.’ ENGLAND (probable): Cook (capt), Bell, Ballance, Root, Morgan, Bopara, Buttler (wkt), Jordan, Tredwell, Anderson, Gurney. SRI .

"Ravi Bopara looks set to pay the price for his dismal form building up to the World Cup by being dropped from Saturday's big opening match against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. England look certain to spring a surprise by preferring Gary Ballance, who returned with a half-century in the final warm-up match against Pakistan after breaking a finger, to the under-performing Essex all-rounder. It is a huge blow to Bopara, who has rarely lived up to his vast potential and could now be facing the end of his England career at 29.

England seemed prepared to give him the opening couple of World Cup matches after struggling in the Tri-series but all the indications were that they had made a decisive call to go with the adopted Yorkshireman. Ballance has been one of the success stories of England's new era in Test cricket and averages over 50 in List A cricket for his county and it has seemed only a matter of time before he got his big one-day chance. And it has come a little earlier than expected because England have finally run out of patience with a man who once scored three centuries in successive Test innings but who has become an under-achieving figure with the bat and a rarely used one with the ball.

"A South Dakota mom's blog post ranting against her sons' school's rules against toy guns has gone viral and won her friends and enemies. Stephenie Metz, 29, says that, despite a society that might frown more and more on toy guns, she'll always let her sons play with theirs. 'I feel like this teaches them to do the things they want to do, while respecting others' rules and regulations,' Metz writes in a post that also criticizes bullied girls who 'contemplate suicide' and parents who pay too much attention to their children. Firing off: Mommy blogger Stephanie Metz's rant about bans on toy guns in school has gone viral, angering many but making the South Dakota 29-year-old a hero to others . Her blog The Metz Family Adventures is usually more lighthearted and features posts about their travels, cooking, and her son's type 1 diabetes. But a post from October 25 titled Why My Kids Are NOT the Center of My World was a bit of a departure. 'This post contains subject matter about which I feel very strongly.  As are most emotionally heated issues,' writes Metz. 'I suppose it's controversial.  But hey, I feel how I feel and that's not going to be changed.' Metz was provoked into writing the post, which had over 500 comments as of Wednesday evening, by something her son said to her. Rant: After her son decided not to take an action figure to school because the drill in its hand looked like a gun, Metz fired off a tirade about over parenting and how society should let boys be boys and girls be girls . He was looking for something to take to show and tell and decided on an action figure that held a little drill. But then he changed his mind: 'I better not take this.  My teacher will probably think it's a gun, and then I'll get in trouble.' Metz was blown away and began to wonder if her boys, who love to play with toy guns, would one day be the target of hatred because of their 'typical boy-ish behavior.' Controversial: 'My kids are not the center of my world': The 21-year-old says a bullied girl who 'contemplates suicide' feels too entitled to a 'world-wide pity party' 'How long before they get suspended from daycare???  How long will it be before one of them gets upset with a friend, tells that friend to go away and leave them alone, and subsequently gets labeled as a bully?' Times are changing, Metz says, and she doesn't like it. 'The mentality of our society in 2013 is nauseating to me, friends,' she writes. Metz says that there was once a time when boys could be boys and shoot toy guns at each other and 'killing the bad guys.' 'Today, those little boys - if caught doing that - are labeled as threats, and immediate action is taken to remove that threat from the group,' she says. As for young girls, Metz says their typical behavior is being punished these days, as well. She writes of an imaginary girl named Susie who is picked on and called names: . 'Susie's whole world crumbles around her, she contemplates suicide, and this society encourages her to feel like her world truly has ended, and she should feel entitled to a world-wide pity party.' Meanwhile, the girl calling Susie names is 'acting like - gasp - a teenage girl acts.' To be fair, many of the comments on Metz's blog are positive and commend her for daring to question current wisdom about firearms and bullying. Metz says she has been mindful not to give herself completely into motherhood in order that she not forget the other things she is: wife, professional, and workout enthusiast. She lets her kids be, she says, in order to make them better people and thinks the world could use a dose of letting kids be. 'I know that I can't change the mindset of modern parents,' she writes. 'I just want to make sure that I raise my sons to grow into respectable men who can thrive and succeed, due to having been prepared to do so.'","Stephanie Metz of South Dakota was inspired to write her rant against over-parenting when she heard her son's take on toy guns in the classroom .

"As bystanders gawped in horror at 144 years of history going up in flames in Eastbourne last week, one art student saw the opportunity for a classic photo. Clutching a bottle of cider and dressed in just a leopard-print bikini, Louisa Foley draped herself pin-up style across a wooden breakwater as behind her the town's pier went up in smoke. Now, after the provocative picture spread like wildfire across the Internet, she has spoken out to defend it from critics appalled by her 'irreverence'. Irreverent: Louisa Foley poses pin-up style in the photo in front of burning Eastbourne pier which has gone viral . The Leeds College of Art student described the controversy surrounding the picture as 'ridiculous' and 'hilarious'. She says she plans to frame the photo and give it to her parents. Eastbourne pier was engulfed in flames on Wednesday after a fire started in its domed amusement hall. 'My friend was visiting Eastbourne, where I'm from, so we decided to pop down to the beach,' Miss Foley told Leeds student newspaper The Tab. 'We were drinking and enjoying the sun when she asked me if the pier usually has smoke coming from it. 'That's when we realised it was on fire and saw it as a great photo opportunity - it's not exactly something you see every day.' The photograph was posted onto Imgur, an image sharing website, where in five days it has attracted nearly 1.3million views and hundreds of - mostly admiring - comments. But some responding on the website were angry at what they perceived as a lack of respect. 'Really wish people would stop taking pictures of my town's historic landmark burning. So many memories on that pier,' wrote one Eastbourne local. Another said: 'Uh...isn't that just a liiiiiitle bit insensitive?' while a third wrote: 'This actually seems kind of messed up'. A fourth bitterly wrote: 'So fashionable to enjoy destruction and human suffering...' Another opined: 'If it were in America or any patriotic country she would be confronted. No-one has respect in my town.' Others were more appreciative of the picture's artistic merit. 'She's smoking,' quipped the top-rated comment, while others compared her to Betty Page or Katy Perry. Miss Foley said of her critics: 'It's ridiculous. It's a great shame that it's happened as the pier's obviously a great landmark in Eastbourne but at the end of the day there's all kinds of photos throughout history of similar events. 'I think it's hilarious how some people are making assumptions of how I'm a tourist or on my day off from work - why do they care? 'They're making assumptions about my life and who I am, which is none of their business. 'It was literally just two girls on a beach, and we decided to take a few photos. 'Of course the burning pier is the main part of the picture but it's a historic event and we wanted to capture it. It's not like we were the only ones taking photos.' She said that her friends and family had found the furore 'funny', adding: 'Might frame it for my parents.'","Louisa Foley has dubbed her critics 'ridiculous' and 'hilarious'

"He still would have worn red as he led an attacking line in England, but life could have been much different for Arsenal marksman Olivier Giroud had he chosen Teeside over the south of France. The Gunners striker revealed Arsenal's FA Cup fifth round opponents Middlesbrough were a genuine option for him as his next move from his first senior club Tours - he eventually decided on Montpellier as his last club before going to the Emirates. 'Yes, that's true,' Giroud told Arsenal.com. Arsenal's Olivier Giroud revealed he could have gone to Middlesbrough when he moved to Montpellier . The Gunners striker chose the south of France over the Teeside club Arsenal face next in the FA Cup . 'Middlesbrough and Celtic (also wanted to sign me). It was a great team… today they are close to coming back into the English Premier League.' Giroud spent January 2009 until May 2010 at Tours, before choosing Ligue 1's  Montpellier that summer. But the Riverside Stadium did play on his mind before making the decision. 'It will be nice to play against them and it will remind me of my previous years in Tours,' he said. Had he gone to Boro, then in their second year back in the Championship following relegation under Gareth Southgate, he would have been working for Tony Mowbray and challenging Australian Scott McDonald to be the club's leading scorer. In retrospect, it's hard to argue with the call he made even with Boro now knocking on the door to return to the Premier League at the top of the Championship after 30 matches. In his final season at Montpellier, Giroud was Ligue 1's top scorer and led the side to their first title . Chelsea's on-loan striker Patrick Bamford is starring up front for Championship leaders Boro .

"Peter Moores has described Andrew Flintoff’s prospective comeback for Lancashire this week as a 'sensitive issue' which must be handled correctly. Moores was Lancashire coach until a few weeks ago, when England asked him back - and for the vast majority of his time at Old Trafford, 2005 and 2009 Ashes hero Flintoff appeared to be permanently retired because of injury. But at the age of 36, the all-rounder has agreed a new deal with Lancashire and is set for a probable return to action in Friday night’s NatWest T20 Blast Roses match at home to Yorkshire. Comeback: England's 2005 and 2009 Ashes hero Andrew Flintoff is aiming to make a Twenty20 return . High five: Flintoff played for St Annes, Lancashire, before his possible return for the county against Yorkshire . Cautious: England head coach Peter Moores believes Flintoff's possible return is a 'sensitive issue' Merited: The ex-Lancashire head coach thinks Flintoff should only play  if it benefits the team . The snag is perhaps, however, that his employers somehow have to find room for him in a team which has won each of its last four Twenty20 matches. Moores said: 'It’s a sensitive issue with the players that are there. 'That’s got to be handled right. It’s a challenge, I think... a fit, strong, playing-well Andrew Flintoff is going to add to any side. 'Coming back from retirement, they’ve got to make the assessment to where that’s at - against what they’ve got in their current staff. 'To know that, you’d have to be on the inside - watching people practise and play and decide that it’s not too much of a distraction, it’s going to work.' Glory days: Flintoff won the Ashes in 2005 and 2009 (pictured) before injury forced retirement . Pace: The fast bowler took three wickets in his comeback match for St Annes last week . Asked if it might be a conundrum for Lancashire to fit Flintoff into their team, Moores said: 'You’d think so. 'It’s got to be a cricketing decision. 'They are playing really good cricket at the moment, so definitely you’d think it would be a tough side to get into. 'You pick the best side to play for Lancashire. That’s what the supporters are going to watch, and that’s what’s the most important thing.'","Moores believes the situation must be handled correctly .

"Sky has claimed it won the battle over Premier League television rights after BT Sport tried to 'muscle in'. The £5.136billion deal for the 2016-19 rights was announced this week with Sky paying £4.176billion for 126 matches including the new Friday night slot, while BT Sport will pay £960million for 42 games.

"Disgust: Ira Isaacs, 61, has been sentenced to four years in prison after being convicted on felony obscenity charges in Los Angeles . An adult film producer has been sentenced to four years in prison after selling fetish porn featuring bestiality and human excrement. Ira Isaacs, 61, was jailed on Wednesday after being convicted on five counts of felony obscenity by a jury last April in Los Angeles. The jury took two hours to reach its decision on April 27, 2012. During the trial, jurors were forced to watch hours of videos in which females engaged in sex acts involving human waste and animals. Other evidence at trial showed that Isaacs had made obscene videos where he directed women to perform sexual acts involving human waste. Isaacs claimed that the extreme pornography, . which he had bought from other people and sold through his business L.A. Media since 1999, was 'shock' art. The jail time ends a long-running legal . saga that saw two mistrials, including one in which sexually explicit . material was found on a personal website of the chief justice of the . U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, who was overseeing the case. Isaacs was indicted as part of an . effort by a Bush administration task force to crack down on smut in the . United States. The unit has since been disbanded. Isaacs's case is believed to be the last case of its kind in federal court. Isaacs' 2008 trial was halted after . Alex Kozinski, chief judge of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, had . sexually explicit material on a personal website. Among the questionable images was . video of a man cavorting with a farm animal and a picture of nude women . painted to look like cows. Kozinski recused himself and was admonished by a special committee of his colleagues for actions they deemed as poor judgment. Controversy: Isaacs' 2008 trial was thrown out after judge Alex Kozinski was found to have sexually explicit material on a personal website . At issue at the trial was whether the videos sold by Isaacs were obscene. The test hinged on a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that held that a work is not legally obscene if it has 'literary, artistic, political or scientific value'. Jurors also were asked to decide whether the videos, some of which depicted fetishes involving feces, violated standards of what is acceptable to the community at large. In all three trials, jurors had to watch a series of explicit videos in entirety. In addition to prison time, Isaacs will be supervised for three years following his release and must pay a $10,000 fine.","Ira Isaacs, 61, of California, found guilty of five federal charges last April .

"It was a case of unlucky No 13 for Andy Murray as he crashed out of the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam in a straight sets defeat by Gilles Simon. Murray had won his last 12 matches against Simon but looked off-colour against the Frenchman on Friday 13th as his opponent came through to win 6-4 6-2. Simon will now face Tomas Berdych in the semi-finals. VIDEO Scroll down to see Murray's elimination by Gilles Simon in Rotterdam . Andy Murray reacts after losing against Gilles Simon of France during their quarter-final . Frenchman Simon overcame Murray 6-4 6-2 in Rotterdam on Friday afternoon . The match started in the worst possible way for Murray as Simon broke his first service game then moved into a 2-0 lead to pile the early pressure on the Scot. Murray held his next serve but Simon took his own service game then broke the top seed again to ease 4-1 ahead. The Frenchman then powered 5-1 in front on his own serve leaving Murray with a mountain to climb in the first set. The number one seed did not falter with the ball in hand on his next serve to pull back to 5-2 then broke Simon to cut the gap to two games. Murray held again thanks to a Simon error to trail 5-4 then pushed his opponent all the way as he served for the set, but the Frenchman came through to take it 6-4. Simon started the second set in exactly the same way as the first - with a break of the Murray serve - before following it up with a hold and another break to move 3-0 clear. The match started in the worst possible way for Murray as Simon broke his first service game . Murray (right) had previously beaten his opponent in their previous 12 meetings . Another hold meant Simon had total control of the set but Murray finally got a foothold at 4-1 after clinching on to his service game. A double fault by Simon in the next handed Murray two break points, and the beaten Australian Open finalist took the first opportunity to cut the gap to 4-2. However, Simon broke right back after Murray floated a chip into the net, giving him the chance to serve for the match. The world number 19 did just that, with an out-of-sorts Murray flashing a forehand wide to gift Simon two match points. Murray pulled it back to deuce but Simon came through to take the second set 6-2 and wrap up a crushing defeat.

"Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen may both take the field on Friday evening in the latest round of NatWest T20 Blast matches. You can be sure both men will feature prominently in Saturday morning’s papers – more prominently, in fact, than the games in which they are scheduled to appear. The frisson will say something about their cricketing charisma, and perhaps a little more about the general absence of that quality elsewhere in English cricket. This is to take nothing away from Jos Buttler or Chris Jordan or even Ben Stokes; doubtless Steven Finn will rise again, and there is plenty of time for Eoin Morgan to become the bums-on-seats merchant of England’s middle order. Getting ready to have a Blast: Andrew Flintoff is set to play for Lancashire against Yorkshire on Friday . But when the most attractive storylines of our domestic Twenty20 tournament concern a player who last appeared five years ago, and another who has been cast aside by England after falling out with one power-broker too many, then you are entitled to wonder about the robustness of the game as a whole. A wider question arises here, and it sprung to mind almost as soon as Buttler reverse-swept Sachithra Senanayake for four at Lord’s on Saturday. It was not so much the chutzpah of the stroke that stood out, as its statistical shock value: it was England’s first boundary for almost 22 overs. What preceded it seemed to sum up the malaise: faced with a target of 300, Gary Ballance and Joe Root – two highly promising players hailed as the present and the future – poked and prodded as if they were chasing 100 fewer. There is a wilful conservatism about English cricket, and now it was exposed for an hour-and-a-half by bowlers who wouldn’t know a coaching manual if it screamed in their face about getting side on and keeping their arm straight. Had Buttler taken England to victory, he would merely have provided the most glorious of glosses. What happened soon after confirmed that talk of a brave new era has to be seen for what it is. In the post-match press conference, Alastair Cook suggested Buttler wasn’t ‘quite ready’ for Test cricket. Bewilderingly, Buttler himself agreed, adding: ‘That is my honest opinion and that is the opinion of others.’ Yet anyone who watched him flay Sri Lanka all over Lord’s may wonder when exactly he will be ready – and whether any other Test nation would so quickly dampen the enthusiasm surrounding a player who has lit up English cricket during some of its darkest days. At least coach Peter Moores did his best to salvage the situation on Monday with some positive comments about Buttler’s chances of a Test debut. But If England are worried about Buttler’s glovework, then they should remember how clumsy Matt Prior was at the start of his Test career. If they are worried about his batting technique, then they should stop regarding the glass as half-empty. This inherent caution has obviously extended to Buttler’s own sense of self-worth. Thank goodness it hasn’t yet impaired his batting. Making a racket: Kevin Pietersen is in line to play for Surrey on Friday . Last week this column argued for the inclusion of Alex Hales in the one-day team – but the public dilution of Buttler’s Test prospects feels even more jarring. English cricket has rarely embraced unorthodoxy. Even Pietersen, its most recent claimant to the noun, learned his game elsewhere before stating a case so undeniable that the selectors had to give way. But it seems perverse to hail the way ahead while falling into the same old pot-holes. Back, though, to the T20 Blast. As . Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings amassed 428 runs in last . Friday’s IPL eliminator, Middlesex were busy inching their way to 117 . for seven in their 20 overs against Surrey at The Oval. To switch from . ITV4 to Sky Sports was to quit Bacchanalia for Bognor Regis. And . the difference between the two tournaments is about more than cash and . the weirdly cadenced musings of Danny Morrison. It is there in the . attitude. During Sunday’s . final in Bangalore, the Punjab captain George Bailey gave a full quota . of overs to a leg-spinner called Karanveer Singh, who has played all of . four first-class matches. Butler has his sights firmly set on Matt Prior's place in the test side . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . Karanveer finished with four for 54 – and Punjab failed to defend 200. But Bailey had taken a chance and, as one batsman after another traded in a mix of sixes and miscues, it very nearly paid off. It was a gamble, it was beguiling, and it was the kind of decision few English captains would have dreamed of making. Fred and KP should be fun to watch. But the enjoyment of pleasures past mustn’t obscure the hunt for treasures future. Eighteen months ago, in a wood-panelled back room at Nagpur, MS Dhoni casually insisted that India’s first Test series defeat at home to England in nearly three decades wasn’t his most disappointing moment as captain. What then? 0-4 in England? 0-4 in Australia? No. Dhoni opted instead for India’s early exit from the 2007 World Cup – a result that was as hurtful to sponsors and broadcasters as it was to the cricketers. And that set of priorities was evident again on Friday, after Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings were beaten to a place in the IPL final by a Virender Sehwag-inspired Kings XI Punjab. Dhoni’s mask slipped: his overseas players had been ‘irresponsible’, he had ‘belief in my bowling that they will definitely let them score over 200 runs’, and ‘in our bowling attack also there is hardly any quick bowler who can push [Sehwag] onto the back foot’. It’s possible Captain Cool has never been hotter under the collar – or more revealing of his priorities. Sunil Narine caused a stir by choosing to play for Kolkata Knight Riders instead of joining up with his West Indian colleagues ahead of their three-Test series at home to New Zealand. Regardless of the intransigence by the West Indies board as they seek to apply their new (and overdue) ‘West Indies First’ policy, it was instructive to read Narine’s assessment of his own Test career in The Hindu. Stretching himself a bit thin: Sunil Narine chose to play in the IPL rather than join up with West Indies . ‘I am sure if I work hard at it and continue to get opportunities I will get better at bowling in that format,’ said Narine, whose 21 Test wickets have come at 40 apiece. ‘Endurance and patience are the key in Tests.’ And yet the question inevitably arises: how much does he really care? Figures in the IPL final of 4-0-46-1 – the joint-second-most expensive of his 126-match Twenty20 career – seemed like a dubious trade-off for missing a Test series. At some point this summer, the cry will go up for Monty Panesar to return to the Test team: it’s hard to imagine England playing a five-match series against India without employing a front-line spinner, and Panesar remains the best we have following the retirement of Graeme Swann. But his latest skirmish with the authorities, this time after he forgot to turn up for an Essex team meeting, makes you wonder exactly where his mind is. Monty, over to you. Watching brief: Monty Panesar on the balcony after being dropped by Essex for the match against Glamorgan . Not everyone agrees that bowling actions which narrowly transgress the 15 degrees of flexion allowed by the regulations are necessarily bad for the game. But since the regulations are there, it seems strange that it has taken umpires so long to query Sri Lankan off-spinner Sachithra Senanayake – which they duly did after Saturday’s fourth ODI at Lord’s. There is barely a more visible kink in world cricket.

"Arsene Wenger expects the world's leading players to be playing in the Premier League after this week's £5billion television deal.

Clive Efford criticised the Premier League for not spending more of its TV rights riches on grassroots football . 'It will contribute to get the best players all over the world to come to England.

"Jos Buttler was the victim of a 'Mankad' dismissal during England's one-day international - and the perpetrator was controversial Sri Lanka spinner Sachithre Senanayake. Buttler, the new golden boy of English cricket, was run out by the bowler backing up. The fact he was out of his crease meant the dismissal was legitimate - especially as the batsman was twice warned in the spinner's previous over. Despite being legal it is seen as some as against the spirit of the game and the fact it was Senanayake - who was reported for a suspect bowling action the day before the match - only added controversy. Not in the spirit? Sachithra Senanayake appeals for the run out of Jos Buttler at the non-striker's end . The bowler is permitted, before releasing the ball and provided he has not completed his usual delivery swing, to attempt to run out the non-striker. Whether the attempt is successful or not, the ball shall not count as one of the over. If the bowler fails in an attempt to run out the non-striker, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon possible. ICC Standard ODI Match Playing Conditions . Law 42.15 shall be replaced by the following:The bowler is permitted, before he releases the ball and provided he has not completed his usual delivery swing, to attempt to run out the non-striker. Whether the attempt is successful or not, the ball shall not count as one of the over . The practice is named after Indian Vinoo Mankad, who ran out the Australian Bill Brown during a Test in 1947/48. The act infuriated by Aussies and has been known as 'Mankading' ever since. The dismissal sparked quite a reaction, with Graeme Swann tweeting: 'I think if I'd been called for chucking I'd try to keep a low profile for a while rather than pull out the mankad!!! Incredible scenes!' He later added: 'To be clear on this I think the mankad is just wrong even though it's not illegal. Like cuddling your sister whilst watching a film.' Former England captain Michael Vaughan waded in with his opinion and his ire was aimed at Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews. Captains usually decide to call the batsman back in these instances but Mathews did not and Vaughan tweeted: 'Totally blame the Captain... He is the man who makes the decisions and should have over turned the decision... No way to play the game...' Ah, go on! Senanayake tries to persuade the umpire to give Buttler run out and was eventually successful . Former England captain Alec Stewart added: 'The spirit of cricket has been broken but Sri Lanka are within their rights to uphold the appeal. The laws of the game allow this dismissal.' Warwickshire all-rounder Rikki Clarke raged: 'That is absolutely rubbish. Can't get Jos Buttler out normally that they have to do that.' And former Manchester United and Everton footballer Phil Neville - a good junior cricketer - gave his two penn'orth, saying: I got run out like that once -greemount vs glodick away I was 11 playing in 3rd xl - it nearly started a full scale riot!!' England were all out for 219. Off you go: Umpire Michael Gough gives Buttler out after he was 'Mankaded' by Senanayake . Â .","Buttler run out backing up at the non-striker's end after one warning .

"Kevin De Bruyne's impact at Wolfsburg this season has been such that the midfielder's former club Chelsea are regretting letting him go, according to general manager Klaus Allofs.

"Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is ready to shine a light on his players – with them working hard on the training pitch at night. United have submitted a planning application to have floodlights installed on the practice fields at their Aon-sponsored complex in Carrington. Sportsmail understands the move has been ordered by manager Louis van Gaal as he continues to exert his influence at the club. Manchester United have submitted a planning application to have floodlights installed at their Aon Complex . The plans are part of United boss Louis van Gaal's as he continues to exert his influence at the club . Van Gaal is known to pay intense attention to detail and he wants to increase options at the training ground. Wayne Rooney is a self-confessed fan of Coronation Street and may soon find himself out in the Carrington cold rather than snuggled up on the sofa watching the latest drama unfold on the famous cobbles with wife Coleen. The captain also enjoys watching EastEnders although he may have to get Coleen to record the show for him should the application get the green light. However, cosy nights in front of the TV could be saved by the impact the plans could have on the local BAT community. Van Gaal's plans could be scuppered by bats which are protected by UK law . As part of the application, which includes plans for more fencing, United brought in a bat expert to monitor any potential effect on the nocturnal cave dwellers. Bats are protected by UK law and should the proposals be viewed as damaging to the three species spotted at the rural location, the common pipistrelle, soprano pipistelle and Daunbenton's, it could be knocked back. The application, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The benefit of the floodlighting is that it will allow for greater use of the training pitches, particularly during the winter months. 'This is essential in enabling the football club to compete with other clubs, both at domestic and international levels. The floodlighting will enhance the usability and function of the training centre, further helping to maintain its world class status.'

"Aston Villa decided to take the plunge by dispensing of the services of Paul Lambert in midweek after a poor run of results. Tim Sherwood, Jurgen Klinsmann and Glenn Hoddle are among the names said to be on Aston Villa's potential shortlist to take over the reins at Villa Park. Here, Phil Slater of 90min.com suggests who he would want to replace Lambert. So the inevitable has happened, Paul Lambert is gone and Villa are in the bottom three. For many of us, both of these scenarios were spotted a mile off, so why has it taken until now for the club to act? Looking through the potential candidates to replace him does not make for pleasing reading. In fact, it probably demonstrates how far we've fallen since those heady days with Martin O'Neill in charge, when we entertained the nation with our flying wingers and a genuine intent to bash the door down on a slightly different looking top four. The shortlist drawn up by many is a collection of the cringeworthy (Tim Sherwood, Glenn Hoddle), the unproven (Jurgen Klinsmann, Paul Clement) and the washed-up (Nigel Adkins, Gareth Southgate, Hoddle - again), while Michael Laudrup's departure from Swansea City last year left a skid-mark on a promising reputation on these shores. Paul Lambert was sacked on Wednesday night after failing to steer Aston Villa away from the relegation zone . Steve McClaren and Eddie Howe are working wonders at Derby County and Bournemouth respectively . There are no stand-outs. In reality, the most attractive names are those currently contracted to Championship clubs: Eddie Howe, Steve McClaren and, to a lesser extent, Neil Lennon. Had Lambert gone a few months back, during the first of two shamefully barren spells in front of goal, when we were merely on the cusp of our slide towards the bottom half of the table - nevermind the bottom three - maybe we could have thought more long-term about his replacement. The likes of Howe and McClaren, who've implemented successful, attacking styles to enable swift, yet steady progression at their respective clubs (Bournemouth and Derby County), would have perhaps been ideal at the time. Both are renowned for getting the best out of what they've got. Indeed, eight of the 14 Bournemouth players to feature against Derby on Tuesday played in the Cherries' 0-0 draw at Tranmere 22 months ago, which secured their promotion as League One runners-up. While McClaren has managed to coax a goal every 44 minutes out of our very own Darren Bent since January - albeit in the second tier. McClaren has been able to get the best out of Villa striker Darren Bent during the striker's loan spell at Derby . Aston Villa have struggled since Martin O'Neill decided to resign from his role at the club in August 2010 . The trouble is that neither are going to abandon their current projects to rescue Aston Villa from the clutches of the division they're both so close to escaping. It would be like leaving your high-paid job as Google director in favour of a similar role at Ask Jeeves, circa. 2002. The sun probably set on our top-four hopes when we lost O'Neill and Mr. Lerner stopped dipping his hands in his pocket. Losing James Milner that same summer was also a sign of things to come in the transfer market, but as Everton proved last season, you don't always need vast coffers or big-name players to challenge at the right end of the table. Instead, a successful philosophy with a sprinkling of spirit. I'd be surprised if Lambert's departure didn't coincide with Villa scoring goals again, such has been the boulder-like weight on the players' shoulders these last few months, but that said, this appointment has to be right for us going forward. Howe and McClaren tick my boxes, but we may have to survive first.

"Free: Paedophile Gary Karn 48, sexually assaulted two girls aged seven and eight on an allotment but has been spared jail . A man who sexually abused two little girls as they picked fruit at his allotment has avoided jail because a judge ruled it would be unfair to the attacker’s own family. Gary Karn, 48, inappropriately touched his victims, aged seven and eight, after inviting them into his greenhouse to help themselves  to raspberries as they played at nearby allotments owned by one of their fathers. But he escaped with a suspended sentence after a judge decided that it would cause ‘suffering’ for his family. The father of one of the girls, who both had to give evidence to Norwich Crown Court, said the judge’s decision showed no recognition of the impact the assault had on his eight-year-old daughter. ‘He talks about the effect on the offender’s family, but what about the effects on my family?' he said. Father-of-three Karn, a food processing factory worker from Norwich, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault against  a child. The court heard he invited the girls on to his allotment. He told them that he needed to brush spiders off them then put his hands up the top of one girl, and down the trousers of the other. He was also charged with six counts of possession of extreme pornography and one count of possession of indecent photographs of a child. Judge Mark Lucraft decided not to proceed with these offences but took them into consideration. He gave Karn an 18-month suspended sentence, saying an immediate jail term would unfairly affect his family. Trial: After considering the mitigation in the case, Judge Mark Lucraft (left) agreed Gary Karn (right) should not go to prison . ‘I have to consider the impact on . them – people who are not in any way at fault yet might suffer serious . hardship from your actions,’  he said. Jude Durr, defending, had told the judge: ‘Imprisonment will almost certainly lead to him losing his job. If he loses his liberty and they lose . their house, that would have pretty devastating consequences on the . family circumstances.’ The decision outraged the victims’ families, who said the girls have been left traumatised from both the . incident and the ordeal of having to give evidence in court. The father of the eight-year-old added: ‘I find it all very disgusting. The judge has been too lenient.’ He told how the two girls were . playing on his allotment last September when Karn invited them to pick . vegetables and fruit on his plot. The next morning the mother of one . the girls overheard the pair saying they ‘didn’t want to talk to the man . down the allotment’ again. The girls then told what had happened . after breaking down in tears when preparing a salad using vegetables . from Karn’s allotment. The father added: ‘I feel totally let down. The judge lives in cloud cuckoo land. ‘It has caused arguments between me and my wife – it happened on my watch. It has caused a lot of anguish and grief.’ Assaults: Karn had attacked the two girls at these Norwich allotments, claiming the victims had spiders on them . He added: ‘I told my daughter that . she wouldn’t have to see that man ever again and it is all over and done . with and now he is going to be walking around – how do you explain that . to an eight-year-old? It will just confuse her. ‘We have put her through this –and ourselves – and for what? If I had known the outcome I would not have bothered.’ He continued: ‘I’ve worked with . people who have lost their livelihoods when they’ve had points deducted . from their licences and been banned from driving for minor driving . offences yet a paedophile is allowed to walk the streets? It is . ridiculous.’ Harrowing: The two child victims gave evidence at Norwich Crown Court (pictured) during a three-day trial . Talking about how it has affected his . daughter, the father added: ‘There are noticeable little differences. She won’t stay upstairs in bed any more if her mum gets up and she . carries her teddy everywhere as a comfort toy. ‘What scares me is that I am one of . those parents who encourages my children to talk to people and . acknowledge them when they are spoken to. The allotment is the last . place I would have expected this to happen.’ Judge Lucraft suspended Karn’s sentence for two years and banned him from working with children for five years. He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and was given a five-year sexual offences prevention order. Karn last night insisted that he is innocent and said his wife Jane was standing by him. He said: ‘I was not guilty, but I was . done for it and there is not much that I can do about it now.  I don’t . want to stir things up too much more, now I am on a suspended sentence. ‘I didn’t get off lightly because I . didn’t do anything to start with. I was just brushing spiders off the . girls and now I am getting hammered for it.’","Factory worker Gary Karn sexually assaulted two girls while picking fruit .

"Aston Villa have been urged to appoint a manager with experience, by the man tasked with taking charge on a caretaker basis. Scott Marshall, who took training at Bodymoor Heath on Friday morning and will lead the side against Leicester City in the FA Cup on Sunday, said the circumstances were too critical for a novice. Marshall, first team coach, will step into the hot seat at Villa Park where his friend Paul Lambert once sat, assisted by goalkeeping coach Andy Marshall. Paul Lambert was sacked from his position as the manager of Aston Villa on Wednesday . Caretaker boss Scott Marshall believes that the club must appoint someone with experience in his place . 'This is a big club and it's not somewhere for someone to cut their teeth,’ Marshall said. 'It's certainly a big club and I would say there's not many things which are going to prepare you for this experience. 'I think a manager with experience is probably necessary but it's not really my decision or my call.' Marshall and Lambert have exchanged words since the latter was sacked following the 2-0 defeat to Hull that left Villa in the relegation zone. 'I've spoken to him and he's obviously disappointed,' he said. ‘He's been really good for me, he brought me in at Norwich and gave me and opportunity there and brought me here and gave me a great opportunity to work at a great club. So I'm hugely disappointed that's not going to continue.’ Christian Benteke trains for Aston Villa ahead of their clash with Leicester City on Sunday .

"While Louis van Gaal has been criticised for giving Wayne Rooney a new position this season, the decision by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers to take Emre Can out of midfield and put him into a three-man defence seems to have been the making of the £10million German Under 21 international. From being ridiculed as a plodding central midfield player with the turning capabilities of the QE2, Can is now being compared to Alan Hansen and all the other great Liverpool defenders who were comfortable on the ball and used as a springboard for attacks. He's gone from Reliant Robin to Rolls Royce, which is how Rodgers described the 21-year-old after snuffing out Everton in the Merseyside derby a couple of weeks ago. Emre Can (here holding off Tottenham's Eric Dier) has found a new lease of life in a back three at Liverpool . Can was described as performing like a 'Rolls Royce' against Everton by manager Brendan Rodgers . Can was also man-of-the-match when Liverpool beat Spurs 3-2 on Tuesday night ahead of Saturday's FA Cup fifth-round tie against Crystal Palace, when Rodgers faces a big decision whether to leave Can at the back or restore him in the middle to cover for the injured Steven Gerrard. Liverpool have lost only once in 11 games in 2015 and Rodgers will be reluctant to change things around too much. After the recent goalless draw at Everton in which Can stopped Romelu Lukaku, the manager said: 'He was like a Rolls Royce. He's only 21 and defended fantastically.' Once derided, Can is now regarded as a force of nature by fans on The Kop and whatever the manager chooses to do it is a different Can to the one who struggled immediately following his summer move from Bayer Leverkusen. Tall and powerfully-built, Can was injured just 20 minutes into his pre-season debut at Preston North End, hobbling off with a calf problem. No sooner had he recovered from that, he injured his ankle on international duty. Rodgers must take credit for recognising Can's aptitude for playing in a three-man defence . In between the knocks, he appeared to struggle with the pace of the English game. Last season's Premier League runners-up started the season badly and Can, signed from Bayer Leverkusen, was lumped together with Dejan Lovren, Lazar Markovic, Mario Balotelli and other overpriced summer buys. A great strike against Chelsea at Anfield in November was the first real glimpse of his potential but it was only when he dropped further back that things really began to take off. Lovren was axed and Can slotted in alongside Mamadou Sakho and Martin Skrtel where his calmness on the ball and reading of the game have helped Liverpool stop leaking goals. He was the victim of Diego Costa's stamp in the Capital One Cup semi-final – a sure sign he was getting under the Chelsea striker's skin. Can was the victim of this horrific stamp by Chelsea's Diego Costa in the Capital One Cup semi-final . Gareth Bale was moved further forward from left back and flourished at Tottenham Hotspur . Managers regard it as a badge of honour when they spot a player could do well in a new position. Harry Redknapp was praised for pushing left back Gareth Bale further forward at Spurs and the winger became the world's most expensive player when he moved to Real Madrid. A less spectacular example, but one remembered fondly by Liverpool fans, is Rafa Benitez converting Dirk Kuyt from striker to right-sided midfield player where his phenomenal work-rate gave the team balance, while still chipping with the odd goal. It will be interesting to see where Can's career develops from here. Gerrard's departure in the summer means there will be a vacancy for a holding midfielder who can pass the ball. But if it's deemed Can lacks the necessary speed to do that job, he now has another string to his bow. GARETH BALE . Went 24 Premier League games without a win at left-back but ended 'The curse of Gareth Bale' after he converted into a winger, scoring a hat-trick against Inter Milan and sealing an £86million move from Spurs to Real Madrid. DIRK KUYT . Signed by Rafa Benitez at Liverpool as a striker but when it became clear he wouldn't score enough goals in English football, he played wide-right and ended up becoming a cult figure in his six seasons at Anfield. PAUL MERSON . Merson was a striker when he first won the league championship with Arsenal but it became clear over time his passing ability coupled with a lack of blistering pace would make him more suited to midfield. George Graham switched him and he had more than a decade's success there with Arsenal, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth and England. RYAN GIGGS . A flying winger who relied on his pace throughout his teens and twenties, Giggs re-invented himself as a clever central midfielder in his later years at Manchester United, enabling him to play on until he was 40. GARETH BARRY . Like his former Aston Villa and England team-mate James Milner, has virtually played in every outfield position in his career. Barry started as a full back, made his name for England as a wide player because of his crossing ability but spent the most successful period of his career as a holding midfielder for Manchester City and now Everton.","Emre Can took time to settle into the Premier League after a summer move .

"Andy Murray will face Gilles Simon in the quarter-finals of the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam after defeating Vasek Pospisil in straight sets on Thursday. Murray, who lost out to Novak Djokovic in the final of the Australian Open earlier this month, came through 6-3, 7-5 and will meet eighth seed Simon in the last eight. The match against the 24-year-old Canadian was not a walkover for Murray and he needed to fight back from a break of serve down in the second set to win, but the world number four showed his class and claimed victory in one hour and 43 minutes. VIDEO ABN AMRO highlights: Andy Murray beats Vasek Pospisil 6-3, 7-5 . Andy Murray beat Vasek Pospisil in straight sets in the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament . The first set progressed on serve until the eighth game where Murray found the crucial break, but Pospisil started well and pushed the Scot with a 30-shot rally to draw level at 2-2, showing his intent. Murray, however, moved 4-3 up after the most comfortable service game of the match while Pospisil struggled to find consistency in the next with his own serve, which allowed Murray to claim a break out of nowhere. It gave him the chance to serve for the first set which Murray took, winning 6-3 in 36 minutes. Pospisil held serve at the start of the second but Murray had to hang on to his own service game after a battling effort from the Canadian, who slipped to the floor as his opponent took the match back to deuce then clung on to hold at 1-1. Murray beat Pospisil 6-3, 7-5 to progress to face Gilles Simon in the quarter-final . Murray took control of the second set after breaking Pospisil with a great return down the line to move 3-2 up but was broken back immediately thanks to the Canadian's best return of the match. Pospisil clawed his way back in front on his own serve before pushing Murray close to a break, with the Scot losing his cool and breaking his racquet after slamming it into the court when his first serve went awry. Pospisil claimed the vital break and Murray looked disgusted with himself as the world number 59 moved 5-3 up in the second, however the Scot broke back to put the set back on serve then levelled at 5-5. With the whole court at his mercy and another chance to break Pospisil, Murray sent his cross-court forehand wide to take the 11th game of the set back to deuce, but he eventually came through to win the game and earn the chance to serve for the match. He duly took it and moved into the last eight where he will meet Frenchman Simon, who progressed thanks to a routine 6-4 6-3 win over Jeremy Chardy. Earlier, third seed Tomas Berdych defeated Italy's Andreas Seppi 6-0 3-6 6-3. After being given a good workout by Pospisil, Murray told atpworldtour.com: 'Obviously, the second set was a lot of momentum swings. 'I went up a break, was feeling good, but then I lost my serve to love in the next game. In the game after that I got broken to 15. 'Obviously, when he was serving for it he was in a great position. But we had a 30-shot rally on set point. It was a very physical rally, I was making him do more of the running and I think it took quite a lot out of him. 'My level was good. I moved well and I felt like when I really needed to, I was able to improve my level and step my game up a bit. I found a little bit of extra intensity in the important moments and that was key.'","Andy Murray beat Vasek Pospisil in ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament .

"When it comes to painting, artists around the globe are constantly looking for the next hit - and this one found it in his morning cuppa. These masterpieces are created using different blends of tea and coffee, painting life-like portraits set in cafe environments. Gerard Tonti, 38, began working with coffee and teas six years ago after taking inspiration from fabric dying using the hot drinks in Asian cultures. Van Coffee: Painter Gerard Tonti, 38, creates his life-like artwork using coffee and tea . Mr Tonti's work is all inspired from the coffee house, as he believes both the scene and the colours coffee and tea create on a canvas work well together. Each piece takes several painstaking months to complete, as Gerard has to order in flavoured teas from around the world. By blending different coloured teas and coffee he is able to get the required colours and shades. Gerard, from Pennsylvania, USA, said: ‘I find coffee houses fascinating places - you have people gathered together in their own circles, all there for different reasons. Perfect cuppa: Each piece of art takes several months to complete as Mr Toni experiments with flavoured teas and types of coffee from all around the world to get the right shades . New leaf: He began painting using coffee and tea six years ago and creates sceneries from cafe culture . Unusual art: By blending different types of teas and coffee he is able to get the required colours and shades to reflect real life . True to life: Mr Tonti has painted a man enjoying a cup of coffee while he reads in a quiet cafe . ‘It was only natural that with the medium I was experimenting with I would find myself merging the two into one. I wanted to capture those moments in time at coffee houses where people get together. ‘There are three problems when painting in this medium that were figured out through trial and error; it's been very much an alchemical process. ‘The first problem is getting tea coffee stains to behave like paint. The second is keeping the vibrant colours of the teas from fading when exposed to sunlight - a problem eventually solved by mixing a UV stabilizer into the actual stain once it has been bound. ‘And finally it's difficult to keep the colour from fading when it is exposed to oxygen. A polyacrylic is used after the painting is completed to seal it and protect it from oxidizing. Trial and error: Gerard Tonti has tested his way through different blending methods to stop his art fading . ‘All of the colours, no matter which I was using, would turn into a brown when exposed to sunlight or oxygen. 'The paintings were very monochromatic and all started to look the same before the issues were solved. ‘The hardest part is that all of the teas and coffees behave differently: teas do not mix very well together so a layered approach works best, so I use a variety of tools to get the result that I'm after. ‘Everything from Q-tips, sponges, spoons, brushes and rags are used. I paint fairly large because the medium is very hard to control in smaller spaces.’","American painter uses coffee and tea to colour his works of art .

"A motorist put his Ford Focus ST in for a service but was horrified to learn mechanics had taken it for a 118mph joyride. Wayne Clinning, 42, first took his car in for a service at the official Ford garage to check over the speedometer and tracking. But when he got his Focus back he said half a tank of fuel had been used so decided to activate the dashboard camera when he returned the car for further repairs. When he watched the footage, he was stunned to discover a mechanic joyriding his car at breakneck speeds - reaching up to 118mph. Mr Clinning, from Heysham, Lancashire, said: 'They have violated my trust, joy ridden my car and lied to me.' Scroll down for video . Wayne Clinning, 42, was furious when a dashboard camera system showed a mechanic joy riding his car . The camera on the central mirror showed the mechanic reaching speeds of 118mph in Mr Clinning's car . Mr Clinning, from Heysham, Lancashire, said: 'They have violated my trust, joy ridden my car and lied to me' Another clip from the test drive shows the mechanic reaching 84mph as he nears a roundabout . During the ten minute test drive near the garage in Morecambe, Lancashire on New Year's Eve, the mechanic drives on the wrong side of the road at 114mph. The footage - shot on a tiny camera on the central mirror - also shows him revving the engine, driving as quickly as possible from 0-60mph and squeezing past oncoming traffic. Worse still, when the mechanism returns to the garage, the audio microphone catches him and a colleague rifling through bags in the car. Garage bosses said they were taking the incident 'extremely seriously' and had launched an internal investigation and were taking disciplinary action. Father-of-one Mr Clinning said: 'They were just using and abusing my car, flooring it up and down the motorway. 'I bet this happens all the time and they keep getting away with it. 'They may be doing it to everyone's' cars, and people might not even realise. 'It was just like being burgled, them rummaging though my car, and the driving was so dangerous.' The father-of-one, watching back the footage, feared they may be doing it to other people's cars as well . The footage showed the mechanic driving at 106mph in a 60-zone during the test drive on New Year's Eve . The clip showed a series of hair-raising moments when the test driver squeezed past cars on a junction . The clip shows the mechanic driving out of the industrial estate - where there is a 30mph speed limit - at 56mph, even when he is approaching a junction. Later, a sign at the side of the road shows a 40mph limit but the mechanic cruises at 54mph, speeding up to 84mph as he nears a roundabout. He then drives at 106mph in a 60-zone and reaches 108mph as he passes a sign saying 'Police speed check this area' before pushing the car to its limits at 118mph. He speeds at 71mph down a 60-zone before performing a U-turn, revving the engine repeatedly, and returning at 93mph. On a single carriage way 60mph road he also overtakes an MG car and has to squeeze between it and an oncoming car. His final burst is a 62mph drive down a 40mph road which is half coned off, while he zooms past a sign warning him he is just 250yards from a set of traffic lights. Finally, back in the garage, two workers can be heard discussing the contents of a bag in the car - with one rummaging through the contents. Mr Clinning first took his Ford Focus ST in for a service and new tyres at Pye Motors, Morecambe, just before Christmas, and also asked workers at the official Ford garage to check the speedometer and the tracking . His final burst is a 62mph drive down a 40mph road which is half coned off, while he zooms past a sign warning him he is just 250yards from a set of traffic lights . After watching the footage, Mr Clinning went back to complain and showed a staff member the clip. He said he was 'absolutely mortified' and offered a full £500 refund and two new tyres. Pye Motors director Helen Morley-Pye said the company had reached an 'amicable arrangement' with Wayne. She said: 'Pye Motors have been trading for ninety years and have always prided ourselves on our customer care and service. 'It was brought to our attention by a customer that he had footage of a member of staff driving his vehicle in excess of the speed limit, taken from a camera in his car. 'As a firm we take any allegation extremely seriously and the incident has been duly investigated with an amicable arrangement reached with Mr Clinnings. 'The member of staff in question has been subject to an internal investigation and dealt with under the terms of our disciplinary procedures.' A spokeswoman for Lancashire Police said the force was investigating and added: 'Enquiries are on going at this stage.'","Wayne Clinning, 42, took his car in for a service at Pye Motors garage .

"Two Robin Williams fans have paid their own tributes to the actor by spending hundreds of pounds getting huge tattoos of him on their thighs. Hayley Patterson, 23, and Melanie Plews-Smith, 39, both opted to have Williams's face etched onto the same part of their bodies on Wednesday, the day after he died. Miss Patterson, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, chose an image of the entertainer in character - as Peter Pan in the film Hook - while Mrs Plews-Smith, from Catterick, North Yorkshire had an image drawn on as the star of Flubber. Scroll down for video . Tribute: Hayley Patterson, 23, has long planned to have Robin Williams's face tattooed onto her thigh, and made the decision the day after he died . Close-up: The image shows Williams in character, as Peter Pan in the 1991 film Hook . Second tribute: On the same day, Melanie Plews-Smith, 39, was offered a Robin Williams tattoo in Yorkshire . Design: The image chosen for this one was Williams from the poster for the film Flubber . Both women paid £250 for their tattoos, though Miss Patterson's is coloured whereas Mrs Plews-Smith's is monotone. Miss Patterson said she has always wanted a tattoo of the star, and had hoped to tweet the image to him. News of his suicide on Tuesday prompted her to go ahead with the plan. She said: 'Robin Williams has been a hero of mine since I was a baby and the very first film I saw was Hook. It's still my firm favourite. 'I was going to get the tattoo done and keep posting an image of it online and basically harrass him until he saw it! 'Unfortunately that never got a chance to happen so when I heard he had died I knew I had to get it done now. It will be a permanent memorial to him.' Likeness: Mrs Plews-Smith, a mother of five, says she has passed her love on Williams (left in that tattoo and right in the poster for Flubber) to her offspring . Inspiration: Miss Patterson said she would watch Robin Williams films repeatedly as a child. He is pictured left on her thigh and right in a poster for the film Hook . Miss Patterson's tattoo was drawn as The Ink Doctors Tattoo studio in Southsea, Hampshire, and shows him in The tattoo depicts him in his role as the character of Peter Pan from the 1991 film Hook. Hayley said: 'It cost £250 and is about eight inches - so it did take a few hours. 'I will admit, it did start to hurt in the last 20 minutes or so - but it was worth it for Robin. Mr Williams, 63, was found dead in his home in northern California on Monday morning. A preliminary coroner's report found that the actor's death was attributed to asphyxia caused by hanging. Miss Patterson said: 'I woke up really early the day the news broke and it was devastating. Fan: Miss Patterson had hoped to show Williams her tattoo via Twitter - but the actor died too soon . 'Luckily I had the day off that day - I was in bits and ended up watching six of his films back to back starting with Hook. It's still my firm favourite. 'When I was little I used to watch it religiously so that once I'd finished it, I'd just rewind the tape and watch it from the beginning again! 'To me, this tattoo captures that magic and [tattoo artist] Wesley's captured Robin's characteristics so well - especially his eyes. 'It's hard to imagine that light in those eyes has gone out but now I've got this tattoo, I'll always be able to see that light.' Death: Robin Williams, 63, was found dead in his California home this week. He is pictured above with his wife Susan Schneider . On the same day, Mrs Plews-Smith, a mother of five, was offered the tattoo by local artist Stuart 'Biffa' Sutherland, who thought she would be interested. She said: 'The news of Robin Williams' death was such a shock. 'I have had a couple of tattoos by Biffa done before and trust him completely, so it was an easy decision when they asked if I was interested. 'I have grown up with Robin Williams films and my children now love them as well. 'I wanted to do something to show my appreciation for the actor who meant so much to my childhood, and to highlight that anyone can suffer from depression as he did.'","Hayley Patterson, 23, chose to have image of the actor as Peter Pan .

"Booed: Gay soldier Stephen Hill asks his question via video-link from Iraq . He appeared to have paused as boos echoed through the Orange County Convention Center during last night's GOP debate following a question from a gay U.S. soldier serving in Iraq. But presidential hopeful Rick Santorum claims he heard not a sound of dissent from the crowd following the soldier's question on the repeal of the Army's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy on homosexuality. And if he had heard them, he would have paused to condemn the disrespectful jeers, he said. Stephen Hill, who has recently come out as gay, was shown via a YouTube video link from Iraq, asking: 'Do you plan to circumvent the progress that has been made for gay and lesbian soldiers in the military?' But as he did several members of the audience responded with boos. Gay rights groups have attacked the GOP . and Santorum on the issue - after not one of the nine candidates rushed . to Hill's defence. Adding insult to their plight, Santorum responded by saying he believed the recent . policy change was bad for the military, prompting the crowd erupted into thunderous applause. But the politician insists his reaction would have been much different had he not been so focused on formulating his answer. Santorum told Fox News: 'Yeah, well, I condemn the people who booed that gay soldier. That soldier is serving our country, I thank him for his service to our country. I’m sure he’s doing an excellent job. I hope he is safe, and I hope he returns safely, and does his mission well. Scroll down for video .

'But certainly, had I, I would have . said that that was - I would have said, don’t do that, this man is . serving our country, and we are to thank him for his service.'Reacting . to last night's debate, . GOProud - a conservative gay rights group - issued a statement . condemning . the reaction of the crowd, as well as the candidates.' His defense comes less than 24 hours . after his divisive stand on the issue on last night's stage in Orlando, . Florida. Santorum said: 'I would say any type of sexual activity has . absolutely no place in the military. 'The fact they are making a point to . include it as a provision within the military that we are going to . recognize a group of people and give them a special privilege to, and . removing don't ask don’t tell I think tries to inject social policy into . the military. And the military's job is to do one thing: to defend our . country...' And when the presenter asked what he . would do about Mr Hill and gays already serving in the army Santorum . continued: 'What we are doing is playing social experimentation with our . military right now. 'That’s tragic. I would just say that going forward we would re-institute that policy if Rick Santorum was president. Jeers: The crowd at the Republican Presidential debate booed a serving soldier as he asked candidates a question about gays in the army . 'That policy would be re-instituted as . far as people in, I would not throw them out because that would be . unfair to them because of the policy of this administration. 'But . we would move forward in conformity with what was happening in the . past. Which was- sex is not an issue. It should not be an issue. Leave . it alone. Keep it to yourself whether you are heterosexual or . homosexual.' DADT was official army policy since 1993 until it was repealed on September 20, this year. It . was introduced to stop people who 'demonstrate a propensity or intent . to engage in homosexual acts' from serving in the armed forces in the . belief their presence 'would create an unacceptable risk to the high . standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that . are the essence of military capability.' The . booing incident has provoked fury amongst gay rights groups and many . commentators claim Santorum had failed to show sufficient respect to a . serving soldier. GOProud leaders Christopher Barron . and Jimmy LaSalvia said: 'Tonight, Rick Santorum disrespected our brave . men and women in uniform, and he owes Stephen Hill, the gay soldier who . asked him the question about Don't Ask, Don't Tell repeal, an immediate . apology.' Speaking to . Salon.com anti-DADT campaigner and former U.S. soldier Dan Choi said: . 'Any soldier who courageously stands for truth and not comfort should be . applauded, supported, and respected. 'Stephen Hill serves our country. 'Those who boo our honourable soldiers do not support our troops.' The . Presidential hopeful, who some have claimed was the winner of the . debate, is known for his controversial comments on homosexuality. In a 2003 interview he said that homosexual acts 'undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family.' He added: 'If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery.' And when asked about how to prevent sexual abuse of children by priests, Santorum said the priests were engaged in 'a basic homosexual relationship', going on to say he had: '...no problem with homosexuality. I have a problem with homosexual acts.' In response to his comments activists set up websites linking his name to a term involving gay sex. Santorum has now appealed to Google to remove the comments saying: 'I suspect if something was up there like that about Joe Biden, they'd get rid of it. 'If you're a responsible business, you don't let things like that happen in your business that have an impact on the country.' 'To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle but I suspect that's not true.'","Rick Santorum cheered for claiming he'd bring back Don't Ask, Don't Tell ."
"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge landed in Wellington today accompanied by an entourage of staff including Prince George's new nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, 43. Hired less than a month ago, the Spaniard was pictured today for the first time with the royal party as she got off the Royal New Zealand Air Force jet. Also there to help the Cambridges on their three-week tour of New Zealand were Kate's private hairdresser, two private secretaries, a personal assistant, and a former British ambassador to Washington who is there to advise the royal couple. But despite having to coordinate around 32 changes of dress during the trip to New Zealand and Australia, the duchess has not taken a dresser, preferring to organise her wardrobe herself. Scroll down for video . Team Cambridge: (L-R) Adviser Sir David Manning, Prince George's nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, William's private secretary, Miguel Head, and Kate's private secretary, Rebecca Deacon, in Auckland . Assistants, including a PA and Kate's hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker, right with blue scarf, disembark . While most of the Cambridges' staff . are relatively old hands, Miss Borrallo's introduction to her new job . will be something of a baptism by fire as she keeps her eight-month-old . charge fed, watered, rested and happy. She . will also take full charge on at least two nights, first this Sunday . when they will go without him to Dunedin, and then on 22 April when they . visit Uluru, or Ayer's Rock. Miss . Borrallo, from Palencia, 140 miles north of Madrid, descended the steps . onto the runway at Auckland today with three longer-standing assistants . to the royal couple: David Manning, Miguel Head and Rebecca Deacon. Sir . David Manning, 64, the former British ambassador to the US, was . appointed adviser to the Duke of Cambridge five years ago ahead of his . first foreign tour, a short trip to New Zealand in 2010. William's . private secretary, 37-year-old Mr Head, was also on that trip, and . joined Prince William and Harry's private office in 2009 after working . his way up from the Ministry of Defence press office who acted as a . liaison officer when the younger prince served in Afghanistan. Miss . Deacon, 32, known as Becca, is Kate's private secretary and a close and . trusted confidante for the duchess.  She will be on hand to advise . Prince George's new nanny should she have any questions during the high . profile foreign trip. Start of the tour: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are said to excited about their three-week trip . Prince George's new nanny: Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, 43, will look after him during the three-week tour . The duchess chose not to take a dresser but will be helped instead by staff including her hairdresser, right . But the Spaniard's training at the prestigious Norland College, where fees cost nearly £13,000 per year, will have prepared her well for the job. The internationally-renowned nanny school drew up a shortlist of suitable candidates after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge approached them looking for a nanny for Prince George, from which the royal couple chose the low-key Spaniard. They decided to hire a nanny after relying on help from the Duchess' mother, Carole Middleton, and the Duke's former nanny, Jessie Webb, 71. Miss Borrallo, who is thought to be the first foreign nanny chosen to look after a future British monarch, comes from a smart family of high achievers in Palencia, 140 miles north of Madrid. When her parents, Luis and Maria Teresa, married in a glamorous Roman Catholic ceremony in Madrid in 1967, the wedding was reported in the society pages of Spain's royalist right-wing daily newspaper, ABC. Miss Borrallo is from a wealthy but low-profile family of devout Roman Catholics in Palencia, northern Spain . Miss Borrallo, who like her siblings was born in Madrid, is the only girl in a family of four children, with brothers named Ignacio, Luis and Pablo. Ignacio is a viola and violin teacher in Spain's Castile and Leon region, Luis is a Catholic deacon in the south of France, and Pablo is a teacher. Their father, a well-known engineer, . died of cancer but their mother, a housewife who also teaches disabled . children, still lives in the spacious family apartment in the centre of . Palencia, to which they moved from Madrid in the 1980s. Nicknamed . Santa, which means Saint, when she was young, Miss Borrallo was . expected to become a nun by childhood friends who said the shy, serious . child was a 'good person' with an austere lifestyle who never showed any . interest in boys. The . devoutly Catholic family attended Mass nearly every day, and Miss . Borrallo had extra coaching from a neighbour to help her overcome her . struggles in chemistry, physics and maths for her baccalaureate exams. Neighbours said the young girl was not a 'short skirt type', and never seemed to go through the typically rebellious teenage phase. Young family: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will spend three weeks touring New Zealand and Australia . 'She was a girl distinct from the rest who hardly had any friends and didn't show any interest in boys', said a neighbour.  'We all thought she would end up becoming a nun.' Instead, a passion for children drove her first to take a degree in teaching in Spain, before moving to Britain more than 20 years ago to learn English and pursue a career in childcare. She is believed to have worked for families in Britain before taking the job at Kensington Palace, and has been seen pushing Prince George in his pram in Kensington Gardens, wearing a jumper and trousers and with her hair in a ponytail. Her mother said recently: 'I am very proud of my daughter, that's all I can say.  On the personal front, and professionally, my daughter couldn't be better.' Sir David Manning: The 64-year-old former diplomat was suggested as a mentor for William by the Queen, who had a similar older adviser, 'Boy' Browning, to guide her as Queen in waiting.  Sir David, a key adviser to Tony Blair in the run-up to the Iraq war, was UK Ambassador to Washington from 2003-2007, and is seen as a safe pair of hands. Miguel Head: The 37-year-old minor public schoolboy from Essex is much liked by William and Harry, who describe him as 'fun'.  Brought up in suburban London and schooled in Essex, Mr Head's previous experience at the MoD gives him a shared insight into William's military background. Rebecca Deacon: The well-spoken Newcastle University graduate got to know William when she helped with the planning for the 2007 Concert for Diana and has since become a close ally of his wife.  The daughter of an Army major, at 32 Becca is close in age to Kate, who trusts her totally. Amanda Cook Tucker: One of Prince George's first visitors in hospital (she met him before the Middletons did), 'Mandy' Cook Tucker did Kate's hair before she came out of hospital after George was born last July.  Once married to hairdresser Neville Tucker, whose Knightsbridge salon held a Royal Warrant from 1980-1994, she has cut William's and Harry's hair since they were children and is trusted in royal circles. Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo: Prince George's new nanny comes from a monied, educated but low-profile family in northern Spain and is not expected to be fazed by her new position.  With a love of paella and a passion for childcare, she is said to have worked hard to achieve her new job.","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge take an entourage of at least six staff .

"To eat or not to eat - that is the question . A cake making fan of the Bard has created an intricate three-tiered cake to celebrate the work of Britain's greatest playwright - with some of his best-known characters adorning the icing. Ally College, from Rugby, Warwickshire, created edible versions of some of the greatest characters in literary history. Lady MacBeth, Romeo and Juliet, and ill-fated Egyptian Queen Cleopatra have all had the sugar craft treatment. A fan of the Bard has created a stunning three-tiered cake to celebrate the work of Britain's greatest playwright . 'Give me my robe, put on my crown. I have Immortal longings in me' The cake maker recreates Cleopatra's dramatic death by asp. This sweet treat looks like it has a slightly happier ending . Double, Double toil and trouble.

A cloaked Prospero from the Tempest stands with his staff on the bottom layer - as a hunchbacked Richard III peers around the corner of the cake.

"This is the inquisitive puppy who gave himself and his owners a fright after he got his head stuck in the plug hole of a kitchen sink. Tyson became trapped in the discarded basin while he was out playing with his brother Rocky in a Leicestershire garden on Sunday. Thankfully the poor eight-week-old was released by vets later, after an attempt to ease his head back out using shampoo as a lubricant failed at home. Tyson was fed a sedative and as he relaxed medical staff gave his little body a wiggle and his head slipped back out of the plug hole. Poor puppy: Eight-week-old Tyson the dog was playing in the garden when he somehow got his head lodged in the sink . Free: It was only when taken to the vets that Tyson's head was freed using a sedative to relax him . Owner Nilu Odedra, from Leicester, had to drive Tyson - and the kitchen sink - to an animal surgery, where vets were relieved to find a sedative and a bit of manoeuvring was all that was needed to free the German shepherd rottweiler cross. 'The pair of them were playing in the garden with my daughter, Sonal, and she went upstairs to get changed into some old clothes so she didn't get dirty,' his owner said today. 'We heard barking and I thought something must be wrong because they never bark. 'My daughter started shouting to me. I ran down to her and saw Tyson had got his head stuck in the the wastage plug hole of the sink.' Loved: Nilu Odedra with her puppy Tyson, who she had to drive, along with the sink, to the vets . Freed and happy: Tyson just after his head was eased out of the sink by professionals on Sunday . Nilu and Sonal, 19, tried to use shampoo to lubricate the area around Tyson's neck, but it was no use. She said: 'He didn't like that and my daughter was crying and panicking and I didn't know what to do. 'Luckily, he is the lazy one of the pair of dogs and he wasn't really panicking.' They rang vets at Park Vet Hospital and bundled Tyson and the sink into the car. Attempts: Nilu tried to use shampoo to get his head out but the puppy needed to be relaxed . Vet nurse Faye Martin and colleague Ariel Korber treated Tyson. Faye, who has worked at the surgery for seven years, said: 'I have never seen anything like it. 'It was really quite funny to see this tiny head sticking out of this huge sink. 'I've had dogs with things stuck in their mouths, but never anything like this.' Tyson was given a small sedative to relax him and within minutes vets manoeuvred his head free. Faye said: 'He was a bit embarrassed when he was free. My practice manager said he looked a bit washed out, poor thing, but he was fine.' Nilu said the adventurous pup was back to his normal busy self within a few hours. She said: 'He was running around and we had all the family round to make a fuss of him.'","Eight-week-old had to be put in the car, with the sink, and taken to the vet .

"England’s Young Lions were tamed by Holland as their Algarve Tournament campaign started with a chastening seven-goal thrashing on Friday afternoon. Four down within 18 minutes and five behind by the break, this was far from the positive start England wanted in the competition designed to serve as their main preparation for this summer’s European Championship defence. Indeed, it was Holland who England defeated on penalties in last year’s Euro final in Malta and they gained a handsome measure of revenge in Parchal on a Friday 13 horror show. England fell to an embarrassing 7-0 defeat against Holland at the Algarve tournament . Manchester City starlet Javairo Dilrosun (right) scored a hat-trick for Holland during his side's 7-0 win . ENGLAND (4-2-3-1): Aston Oxborough; Kyron Stabana, Easah Suliman, Cameron Humphreys, Hayden Coulson; Foday Nabay (Danny Collinge 45), Daniel Wright (Connor Ronan 45); Nathan Holland, Callum Gribbin, Layton Ndukwu (Andre Green 71); Jahmal Hector-Ingram (Lukas Nmecha 62) Subs not used: Will Huffer; Marcus Edwards, Tayo Edun, James Yates, Will Patching, Kazaiah Sterling . Booked: Humphreys . HOLLAND (4-3-3): Justin Bijlow (Abdel El Ouazzane 55); Giovanni Troupee, Jelle de Lance, Rick van Drongelen, Timothy Fosu-Mensah; Reda Boultam, Carel Eiting (Teun Koopmeiners 45), Teun Bijleveld (Fredy Druijf); Rashaan Fernandes (Donyell Malen 60), Nigel Robertha (Jay-Roy Grot), Javairo Dilrosun . Subs not used: Shrewel Floranus, Darren Sidoel, Mats Knoester, Faye Lassane, Odysseus Velanas, Dani de Wite . Scorers: Fernandes 5; Humphreys (own goal) 10; Bijleveld 13; Dilrosun 18, 39, 79; Grot 70 . John Peacock’s side trailed inside five minutes when Feyenoord’s Rashaan Fernandes was played through, held off the challenge of Easah Suliman and slotted the ball past goalkeeper Aston Oxborough. Things got worse five minutes later when Oxborough, the Norwich keeper, struck a clearance against his own defender Cameron Humphreys and watched as it rebounded back past him into the net. It was three to the Dutch on 13 minutes when the lively Fernandes advanced down the right to the six-yard box and pulled the ball back to AZ Alkmaar man Teun Bijleveld to poke home. England were shell-shocked and conceded another shortly afterwards. Once more, Fernandes burst forward on his right flank and crossed for Javairo Dilrosun, who is on Manchester City’s books, to volley in. The Young Lions at least gained their composure at this point and even started to create some openings of their own. Leicester City forward Leyton Ndukwu got the better of two defenders before drawing a save from Dutch keeper Justin Bijlow. On the half-hour, West Ham’s Jahmal Hector-Ingram set up Callum Gribbin, of Man United, but his curling effort was pushed clear by Bijlow. There was just enough time before the break for Holland to add a fifth and it was Dilrosun again who capitalised. The second half was pretty academic, with England playing only for pride. But they couldn’t get on the scoresheet and Holland added a couple more to really rub it in. Jay-Roy Grot, on as a substitute, scored No 6 and Dilrosun completed his hat-trick with an excellent free-kick in the closing stages. Dilrosun, a 16-year-old left winger, joined City from Ajax last summer and has already featured for their under 18s in domestic competition and the under 19s in the UEFA Youth League. England will have to regroup quickly as they take on Portugal in their second game on Sunday afternoon.","Manchester City starlet Javairo Dilrosun scored a hat-trick for Holland .

"Queens Park Rangers have confirmed the appointment of Chris Ramsey as head coach until the end of the season. Ramsey is said to have earned the right to take charge of the Barclays Premier League strugglers on a temporary basis after impressing the west London club's owner Tony Fernandes. The likes of Tim Sherwood, Michael Laudrup and Neil Lennon have all been linked with the vacant post at QPR since Harry Redkanpp's decision to leave the club due to a persistent knee injury. Chris Ramsey has been given the QPR manager's job until the end of the season . Ramsey and first team coach Kevin Bond watched on as QPR claimed a 2-0 win against Sunderland . However Fernandes has placed his faith in former Tottenham coach Ramsey to help steer QPR to Premier League safety following his side's 2-0 away win against Sunderland on Tuesday. The 52-year-old will work closely with first team coach Kevin Bond and goalkeeping coach Kevin Hitchcock until the end of the current campaign, while director of football Les Ferdinand will also play a significant role in the management set up. Fernandes told QPR's official website: 'In the wake of Harry Redknapp's resignation, it was my desire to identify the right individual for the job and at this time, we believe Chris is the ideal candidate. 'He has impressed everyone here in his short time in charge and I firmly believe he is the right man – working closely with Les – to lead us until the end of the season. 'Chris has an opportunity now to stamp his authority and class on the position. He is part of our long-term plans at QPR. 'A lot has been written and said about the position, including by myself, but the decision has been taken to defer the permanent appointment until the end of the season. Bobby Zamora scored QPR's second goal as they beat Sunderland to claim their first away win of the season . Zamora celebrates with his team-mates as Ramsey won his first game as caretaker manager . Hull (A) Arsenal (H) Tottenham (H) Crystal Palace (A) Everton (H) West Brom (A) Chelsea (H) Aston Villa (A) West Ham (H) Liverpool (A) Man City (A) Newcastle (H) Leicester (A) 'We spoke to many individuals who were interested in the role, one of whom I was quoted on as being a dream, but none of them were right to take the club forward at this time for a variety of reasons, whereas we firmly believe Chris is. 'We are keen for the position to be a long-term appointment that will play a major role in shaping the future on-field progression of QPR. For that reason, it is vitally important that we get the right individual. 'As a Board of Directors, we are determined to make the right appointment in the best interests of the club. 'Premier League survival is our priority in the short term, but in the medium and long term we want to make sure everything is in place, from the Academy upwards, to create a lasting legacy and philosophy at QPR.' Director of football Ferdinand added: 'I've been liaising closely with the Board over the last week or so regarding the position and it became apparent that Chris is the best man for the job at this time. Caretaker boss Ramsey watches on as his side play a friendly against Chicago Fire . QPR director of football Les Ferdinand is hoping Ramsey can steer the Premier League strugglers to safety . 'He's settled into QPR fantastically well over the last few months. He is highly thought of by everybody and has the respect of everyone connected to the club. 'He will have a huge part to play in the long-term future of this club at all levels, and we are confident that Chris, supported by the backroom staff, will be able to deliver our goal of Premier League survival.' Caretaker manager Ramsey, who was congratulated on his new role by club captain Joey Barton on Thursday, also had his say on the appointment by stating he was honoured to be offered the role until the end of the season. 'This is a great privilege and an honour for me. I am excited about leading the club between now and the end of the season,' said Ramsey. 'I believe in this group of players, the staff, and everyone working at the club. 'I'd like to thank the QPR supporters for their support so far and with their backing, I am confident that we can build on Tuesday's win at Sunderland and start to climb the table. 'During this period, I will still be involved in the running of the Academy for the rest of this season and beyond. Continuity is very important when it comes to the development of young players, which is something I am very mindful of.' Real Madrid assistant manager Paul Clement remains a potential summer target for Fernandes should he decide to leave the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season. Real Madrid assistant manager Paul Clement is said to be a potential summer target for QPR . QPR chairman Tony Fernandes will appoint Chris Ramsey as Rangers boss until the end of the season. Here Sportsmail look at five key issues he needs to address to ensure they beat the drop. AWAY FORM . Despite picking up their first win on the road against Sunderland last time out, the previous 11 matches did not yield a single point for Rangers. With Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea still to come to Loftus Road, their away form could be the key to ensuring their Premier League survival. LEAKY DEFENCE . Rangers have the joint worst defensive record in the league and, with goals also at a premium, tightening up at the back is a must. Harry Redknapp failed to identify his preferred central defensive partnership so finding a system that gets the best out of Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker could make the difference. SHARE THE GOALS . Charlie Austin has contributed 50 per cent of QPR's goals in the Premier League and that form has rightly led to talk of a potential England call-up. But Ramsey will be looking for someone else to help shoulder the scoring burden, especially with the former Burnley man not having scored in open play since the December win over West Brom. CALM JOEY BARTON DOWN . This may be easier said than done, with the combative midfielder becoming the first player in Premier League history to be cautioned in seven consecutive matches. Barton's leadership qualities and never-say-die attitude are far more beneficial on the field than off it, so avoiding suspensions is crucial. INTEGRATE A SQUAD OF EGOS . Barton, Adel Taarabt, Ferdinand. None of the three are afraid to speak their minds and they are not the only squad members with chequered pasts. Sandro and Mauro Zarate have also had high-profile disagreements with managers and Ramsey will need to forge a team ethos to stand any chance of survival.","QPR owner Tony Fernandes has placed his faith in Chris Ramsey .

"Symbolic: This yoghurt pot, dating back to the 1970s, has only just washed up onto a British beach . Faded and cracked but still largely intact, this yoghurt pot dating back to the 1970s has only just washed up onto a British beach – a symbol of the abiding legacy of our throwaway culture. Discovered in Teignmouth, Devon, the pot was among 25 tonnes of rubbish cleared off beaches by volunteers in a four-day blitz. The lettering remains clear on the pot despite the fact that it was bought from a Tesco store 40 years ago for 11p. Volunteers cleared millions of items of marine litter from beaches up and down the UK during the blitz at the end of March. Campaigners say the vast sea of discarded packaging floating around Britain is a growing threat to marine animals, which regularly wash up dead with stomachs full of plastic. The collection of deadly flotsam also included thousands of Lego pieces washed off a container ship in 1997, a TV, a set of dentures, and a plastic chicken. Surfers Against Sewage, the campaign group which co-ordinated the operation, described the scale of the pollution as jaw dropping. SAS chief executive, Hugo Tagholm, said volunteers found more than 3,200 pieces of litter for every mile of beach. He said: 'Whilst removing shocking amounts of the usual marine litter suspects like plastic bottles, cigarette butts, fishing net and plastic bags, volunteers were also hunting for weird and wonderful items of marine litter.'

"Yaya Toure and Max Meyer have been major driving forces behind their respective sides' success this season and the pair got together to showcase their skills as the Champions League moves up a gear next week. Japanese car maker Nissan brought the pair together to demonstrate some audacious passing ahead of a seismic few weeks of European action for Manchester City and Schalke. Meyer was buckled into a crash test dummy track and launched towards a set of goalposts before Toure launched a pin-point pass towards the German star. Just before the brakes slammed, Meyer met Toure's pass head on to guide the ball into the net. Schalke striker Max Meyer is strapped into a crash chair before being launched down a track . Meyer is launched down the track and gets on the end of a perfect Yaya Toure (right) pass to head home . The pair then showed off their cultured passing games as Meyer and Toure took turns knocking balls into the open roof of a Nissan car set up on a ramp. An impressive showing from the duo, no doubt. Manchester City have certainly missed Toure in recent times, and were boosted by the his return to training on Thursday. The 31-year-old had been away with the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, where the midfield powerhouse helped the Elephants to victory. City suffered in Toure's absence.

"Britain's biggest firms owe the taxman up to £25.5billion, but are regularly let off the hook, MPs say today. The sum is equivalent to £1,000 for every British family - or the equivalent of 6p being cut from the basic rate of income tax. While families, shopkeepers and small businesses are forced to pay their bills in full, big businesses are striking favourable deals and have an 'far too cosy' relationship with HM Revenue and Customs. The £25.5bn is HMRC's own 'ballpark estimate' of the maximum tax liabilities of big businesses . They are having their tax bills cut or managing to avoid paying interest. Dave Hartnett, the out-going HMRC chief . executive, was wined and dined 107 times by big firms' tax lawyers and . advisors between 2007 and 2009, the report revealed. Margaret Hodge, Labour . chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, accused the tax office of . hiding behind a 'veil of secrecy' to keep deals private. She said the panel of MPs had to rely on a whistleblower and a private eye to find out about the questionable deals. A controversial deal struck by Goldman Sachs which allowed them to avoid paying up to £20million would never have come to light if it had not been for the insider. Unlike millions of hard-up taxpayers, Dave Hartnett (pictured) will never struggle to find money to pay his bills, or face the choice between heating and eating. The 60-year-old Permanent Secretary at HM Revenue and Customs, pictured, is due to retire next summer on between £75,000 and £80,000 a year, and will also get a lump sum of between £160,000 and £165,000. When he retires, he may miss the programme of corporate hospitality that he has enjoyed during his time at HMRC. Between 2007 and 2009, he was entertained 107 times, mostly at breakfasts, lunches and dinners, by banks and law and accountancy firms. In . total, the report says, HMRC is seeking to resolve more than 2,700 . issues with the biggest companies, including disputes over outstanding . tax, with potential tax at stake of £25.5billion. It said: . ‘We have serious concerns that large companies are treated more . favourably by HMRC than other taxpayers.’ It criticises the department’s ‘specific and systemic failures’. Campaign group UK Uncut have vowed to pursue firms for unpaid tax through the courts. Mrs Hodge, speaking on BBC Radio 4's . Today programme, said this morning that they discovered a lack of accountability. ‘This is a bit like David and Goliath,' she said. 'The big companies have very expensive lawyers and Advisors. HMRC have . very few people who have in-depth knowledge of tax affairs. ‘There is no dissociation between those who negotiate and authorise . them (the deals). 'They hide behind a veil of secrecy claiming taxpayer . confidentiality so there is no accountability as to whether these deals . provide good value for money.’ She accused HMRC of striking ‘sweetheart’ deals with big businesses . which would be denied to hard-working families, shopkeepers and small . businesses. Mrs Hodge said the panel had to rely . on the testimony of a whistleblower as well as a private eye in a situation she described as ‘very unconscionable'. Banking giant Goldman Sachs was allowed to skip a multi-million pound interest bill on unpaid tax on bonuses after outgoing chief executive Dave Hartnett was wrongly advised there was a 'legal impediment' to collecting it. The potential cost to the taxpayer is officially put at £8million but the committee was given evidence from a whistleblower that the sum could be as high as £20million. In its report the MPs expressed astonishment that HMRC 'chose to depart from normal governance procedures' by allowing the same senior officials to both negotiate and approve such deals. Worse, it said, the Goldman deal was done 'without legal advice' or an official note being taken of the meeting, with officials relying on the firm's records. Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the committee, says the report, published today, is ‘a damning indictment of HMRC’. Scathing: Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the report is a 'damning indictment of HMRC' She is particularly critical of . the refusal by the department’s executives to answer questions from MPs . about details of its dealings with big business. They . insisted that there were issues of confidentiality, but Mrs Hodge . dismissed these claims, saying they are using ‘a cloak to protect the . department from scrutiny’. The . report says executives, such as the Mr Hartnett , gave ‘imprecise, . inconsistent and potentially misleading answers’, and states: ‘This . situation is entirely unacceptable.’ It warns: ‘The department has left itself open to suspicion that its relationship with large companies is too cosy.’ The £25.5billion is HMRC’s own . ‘ballpark estimate’ of the maximum potential tax liabilities of big . businesses, calculated before any proper investigation has taken place. The figure can be dramatically cut by . a business legitimately applying for a relief, or being able to offset a . tax liability against a loss made in the previous financial year. The . report is published days after Mr Hartnett, 60, announced his plans to . retire next year following a barrage of criticism surrounding his . running of the department. He will not be leaving empty-handed. He stands to scoop a pension which is currently worth between £75,000 and £80,000 a year. This . gold-plated sum will be paid after Mr Hartnett has taken a lump sum of . between £160,000 and £165,000 from his £1.7million pension pot. The . report is critical of his attendance at a ‘significant’ number of . lunches and dinners ‘with large companies with whom HMRC was settling . complex tax disputes’. Emma Boon of the TaxPayers’ Alliance . said: ‘Ordinary taxpayers often feel that they are treated harshly when . they make genuine mistakes because of our complicated tax system. ‘This report will increase suspicions that big businesses are treated differently.’ Some of the big business settlements are currently the subject of a separate investigation by the Government’s spending watchdog, the National Audit Office. HMRC has been responsible for a catalogue of errors recently. Around 6million taxpayers are currently getting letters saying they have over-paid, and can expect to get back £400 each, equal to £2.5billion. Around 1.2million others  are being told they need to pay an average of £600 more. Yesterday an HMRC spokesman rejected the MPs’ report, saying it was based on ‘partial information, inaccurate opinion and some misunderstanding of facts’. He said the £25.5billion figure was ‘a ballpark estimate of maximum potential tax liabilities’. It is not ‘actual tax’ that is owed or unpaid. He added: ‘In many cases, when HMRC has looked at the full facts, it becomes clear that there is no further liability at all.’ David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘The Government has full confidence in HMRC and its current leadership.’","6p could be cut from basic rate of tax if £25.5bn bill was paid in full .

"Thousands of people having keyhole knee surgery could be wasting their time, claim researchers. New research suggests that middle-aged people with mild osteoarthritis get little, if any, benefit as a result. A study investigated how best to treat torn meniscus, crescent-shaped cartilage that helps stabilise knees. In the UK many patients have arthroscopic procedures either on the NHS or privately to reduce knee pain. Thousands of people having keyhole knee surgery could be wasting their time, researchers have claimed . This involves a procedure called debridement, which involves tidying up damaged cartilage and ligaments or removing loose debris from the joint. But a study published in the Canadian Medical Journal found surgery is not more effective in the short or long-term than doing nothing. Arthroscopy involves two small stab wounds made on either side of the front of the knee. One is for a telescope called an arthroscope, enabling the surgeon to see directly inside the area, and the other is for an instrument to carry out the surgery. Surgeons typically smooth damaged cartilage surfaces on the end of bones, which can cause stiffness and pain, and flush out bone chips. The minimally invasive procedure allows for quicker healing than traditional surgery, but can still trigger complications such as blood clots, infection and nerve or blood vessel damage. During keyhole surgery, an arthroscopy, surgeons can smooth damaged cartilage surfaces on the end of bones, pictured is a computer generated image of cartilage . Canadian researchers analysed seven good quality trials, involving 811 knees in 805 patients, with an average age of 56 years. The procedure was carried out for symptom relief in patients with mild or no osteoarthritis, compared with similar patients who did not have arthroscopy for meniscal tears. In four trials there was no short-term pain relief in the first six months after surgery for patients with some osteoarthritis. There was no improvement in long-term function up to two years later in five trials. Study leader Dr Moin Khan, Division of Orthopedic Surgery, Department of Surgery, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, said: ‘Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative meniscal tears in the setting of mild or no concurrent osteoarthritis in middle-aged patients may have little, if any, effect on short-term and long-term outcomes in comparison with nonoperative management.’ He said doctors need to carefully weigh the costs and benefits when deciding which middle aged patients should undergo surgery. ‘With limited evidence supporting arthroscopic meniscal débridement for degenerative meniscus tears in the setting of mild or no osteoarthritis, an initial trial of nonoperative interventions should play a large role for middle-aged people,’ he added. A 2008 Canadian study found that patients undergoing surgery for knee arthritis did no better than those having physical therapy and taking medication. Experts believe arthroscopy should not be used routinely to treat osteoarthritis, but say it may still help patients with mild symptoms or a recent injury. NHS guidelines recommend GPs only refer arthritis patients for arthroscopy when they suffer locking of the knee, not other symptoms.","New research suggests middle-aged people with mild osteoarthritis get little, if any, benefit from surgery .

Crashing: The attack on the plane - from which the pilot ejected - happened in a border region where Syrian rebels have been battling President Bashar al-Assad's forces . Syria said Turkish air defences shot down the jet while it was attacking rebel forces inside Syrian territory, calling the move a ‘blatant aggression’. Turkish media reported that the army warned two Syrian jets approaching the border to turn away, but scrambled its F-16 jets when one refused to abide by the warning.

"Rupert Murdoch joined scores of mourners paying their respects to war correspondent Marie Colvin at an intimate funeral in the New York community where she first decided to become a reporter. Standing sombre-faced outside the Long Island service, the News Corp CEO forgot his own troubles to bid farewell to the journalist who had worked at his paper, The Sunday Times, for 27 years. He was joined by John Witherow, the editor of the paper that Colvin was working for when she was killed by a rocket blast in Syria last month. Bidding farewell: Rupert Murdoch, News Corp. CEO, leaves the funeral . of Marie Colvin, who was working for The Sunday Times, which is owned by . News Corp. when she was killed in Syria in February . Mourning: Marie Colvin's mother Rosemarie is embraced by a mourner as they arrive for the funeral service . Ceremony: Rosemarie Colvin walks at the head of the congregation as her . daughter's coffin is carried into the St. Dominic Roman Catholic Church . in Oyster Bay. Bagpipes played as the mourners walked to the church . Colvin's elderly mother Rosemarie, wept as she arrived at the funeral, before leading the congregation inside the St. Dominic Roman Catholic Church in Oyster Bay, where Colvin . grew up. Members of the congregation drove beneath a large American flag hung along the street to reach the ceremony. Bagpipes played Amazing Grace as they walked along the path towards the church. A group of Sri Lanka immigrants gathered outside the church holding up a placard that described Colvin as the 'uncrowned queen of intrepid journalists'. Inside, a portrait of the journalist in her signature eye patch - which she wore after losing her left eye in 2001 during the Sri Lankan civil war - and a book full of her newspaper articles were on display. During the service, Colvin's best friend from college at Yale, Katrina Heron, told the 200 mourners that Colvin was 'full of passion, full of belief'. She joked: 'She would probably say this was a bit sedate for her tastes. I think she'd take one look around and say ""Can we move this party? I know a great little place down the road"".' Sadness: John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times, talks with reporters after the funeral service . Reflection: Murdoch and Witherow after the service. Colvin had worked for The Sunday Times since 1985 . 'Marie lived her wish to know that there . was tenderness in the world,' Heron added. 'She lived it fully and she . died for it.

She was the most respected, talented, compassionate, selfless journalist . of her generation.' The piper played Going Home as Colvin's coffin was taken from the church for a private cremation. Leaving the church, Mr Murdoch called the service 'beautiful'. Colvin was killed . while covering the Syrian government's crackdown in the country where . thousands of civilians have been killed since a popular uprising began a . year ago. Colvin, 56, had spoken her last words in a . television dispatch from a village while watching a baby boy dying. She said seeing the horror might 'move people to think, why is this . going on?' In a final live broadcast with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, she explained the Syrians were shelling 'a city of cold, starving civilians'. 'It’s a complete and utter lie that they are only going after terrorists,' she added. 'There are no military targets here.' It is fire that she succumbed to just hours later when a building that served as a makeshift media centre in the Baba Amr district of Homs was struck by an army mortar. It is believed she died while trying to retrieve her shoes - which she had taken off to follow Middle Eastern custom - so she could escape the bombardment.

"Women who have IVF babies using donor . eggs could be much more at risk for a common but potentially dangerous . complication of pregnancy, warn researchers. A new study shows a threefold higher risk of hypertension – high blood pressure – and an even higher risk of pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia . is a severe disorder of high blood pressure in pregnancy that is . potentially fatal for the mother and baby and the only cure is to . deliver the baby surgically. The . use of donor eggs in IVF (in vitro fertilisation) is increasingly . common among older women trying for a baby who have no eggs of their . own. Older women who become pregnant using donated eggs (frozen eggs are pictured) have an increased risk of suffering potentially fatal complications when giving birth, new research warns. An increasing number of older women are now having to rely on donor eggs to have children . But French . researchers say the pregnancies of egg donation patients are at a higher . risk of disorders caused by high blood pressure, than the pregnancies . of IVF patients using their own eggs. They . found almost one in five pregnant women using a donated egg developed . hypertension, compared with one in 20 women using their own eggs during . IVF. Altogether 11 per . cent of women using donor eggs suffered pre-eclampsia, compared with . less than three per cent of women using their own eggs. The . study carried out by Dr Helene Letur, from the Institut Mutualiste . Montsouris in Paris, involved 580 pregnancies, including 217 from egg . donation and 363 where women used their own eggs. Dr . Letur said other studies had made similar findings, but they were small . and not strictly controlled for factors that might give a false result. In contrast, the latest study had a large sample and careful comparison with women using their own eggs during IVF. She . said ‘We would have to conclude from the results that egg donation . itself is a risk factor for pregnancy-induced hypertension and . pre-eclampsia. Compared to women who have IVF with their own eggs, women with donor eggs also have a greater risk of getting pre-eclampsia and a threefold increase in the chances of having high blood pressure (illustrated with a stock image) Pre-eclampsia is a condition that affects some pregnant women, usually during the second half of pregnancy or soon after their baby is delivered. Early signs include high blood pressure (hypertension) and protein in urine. Some women suffer severe headaches, vision problems and pain just below the ribs. The condition can lead to serious complications for mother and baby if it is not monitored and treated. There is a risk that a mother can develop fits - but these are rare. Pre-eclampsia affects up to five per cent of pregnancies and severe cases develop in up to two per cent of pregnancies. The exact cause of the condition is unknown but it is thought to occur when there is a problem with the placenta. The condition kills around six women every year in the UK and almost 1,000 babies each year, mostly because of complications in early deliver, such as severe breathing difficulties. Source: NHS Choices . ‘This has growing importance because of the increasing number of egg donations.’ Experts . say it is likely to be caused by the body’s response to cells it doesn’ t recognise, with donor eggs being treated as ‘foreign’ and triggering . an immune reaction. The . results of the study were reported today at the Annual Meeting of . the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in . Munich. In the US, egg . donation now accounts for around 12 per cent of all fertility treatments . and around four per cent in some European countries. The . extent of use of donor eggs in the UK is not known, although egg . sharing, where fertility clinics waive or reduce the fee to women who . allow some of their eggs to be offered to strangers, accounts for 3.5 . per cent of treatments. Egg . donation is a highly successful treatment because it uses eggs from . younger women, which are less likely to carry defects and more likely to . lead to pregnancy and birth than eggs from older women. The . French study found a threefold higher rate of hypertension in patients . using donor eggs of 18 per cent, up from five per cent among women using . their own eggs. There . was an even higher risk of pre-eclampsia, rising from 2.8 per cent in . women with their own eggs to 11.2 per cent in women using donor eggs. Dr . Letur said it was a high rate of hypertension affecting women using . donor eggs that patients and obstetricians must be aware of. She . said ‘Preventive measures and care are necessary, with screening for . risk factors for hypertension such as obesity and diabetes and early . treatment.’ In some cases, . women at high risk could be prescribed low-dose aspirin from the 12th . week of pregnancy which has been shown to help reduce the chances of . pre-eclampsia. ‘For the future, might we match donors and recipients based on genetic factors’ she added.","Experts from the Institut Mutualiste Montsouris in Paris studied 580 pregnancies at seven IVF centres in France for their research .
Women who use donor eggs during IVF, rather than their own, have a greater risk of getting pre-eclampsia, they claim .
The researchers found women who get pregnant using donated eggs are three times more likely to have high blood pressure .
Findings have important implications because an increasing number of women now rely on egg donors to have children later in life ."
"Comedian Tommy Cooper loved a good pun . Heard the one about Cadbury’s introducing an Oriental chocolate bar to its range? Could be a Chinese Wispa. That’s not my joke. It belongs to comedian Rob Auton and it has just won the annual award for Funniest Joke at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, as voted for in a public poll. But it’s also, like most of the Top Ten gags in the poll, a pun — an old-fashioned, straightforward play on words. Indeed, it’s so old-fashioned that I can remember my sister reading out a similar joke from Smash Hits magazine in the Eighties: ‘Why did George Michael have chocolate on his face?’ — ‘He was Careless with his Wispa’. Is Rob Auton’s line really the funniest joke of the year? There’s probably two dozen equally good puns in the average edition of Radio 4’s I’m Sorry I Haven’t A Clue. But puns always dominate the Edinburgh list, because they require no context. They’re always quotable (and Tweetable) in a way that other jokes, requiring a long set up or an element of visual humour, may not be. Last year’s winner was ‘I’ll tell you who gives kids a bad name: Posh and Becks.’ It wasn’t particularly ground-breaking, it was perhaps a little out of date, but it had immediate, widespread appeal. The runner-up was Tim Vine’s ‘Crime in multi-storey car-parks — that’s wrong on so many different levels’, which, for me, is a better joke. You only have to look at Twitter, or read the headlines in the tabloids,  or listen to gags being told in pubs and playgrounds up and down the country, to realise that we Brits love puns. Great writers: Chaucer loved puns while Shakespeare could never resist them . They have been embedded in British life and language for as long as we have spoken English. In fact, before we spoke English. In the 6th century AD, Pope Gregory I’s reaction to seeing fair-haired English boys for the first time was ‘Non Angli, sed Angeli’ — ‘they are not Angles, but Angels’ — proving that even Popes love a good pun. In Latin. And any student of English literature quickly realises that even our greatest writers have had a weakness for double-meanings. Chaucer loved them. Shakespeare could never resist them. It’s always satisfying to hear the audience groan in a Midsummer Night’s Dream when Bottom, magically given the head of a donkey, responds by saying ‘this is to make an ass of me’. You’d think, with such a literary heritage, that puns would be a highly regarded art, but quite the opposite is true. Puns are more often than not seen as an embarrassment. I remember a lecturer at Cambridge talking about Shakespeare’s ‘fatal weakness for puns’, as if it were a major flaw in the Bard’s credentials. Indeed, in the world of comedy, puns are seen as the lowest form of wit. Oddly John Cleese allowed some truly egregious puns into Fawlty Towers . ‘A pun,’ said John Cleese, of Monty Python and Fawlty Towers fame, ‘is a substitute for a joke.’ Cleese would get famously angry at the pun-laden scripts of the Sixties BBC radio hit I’m Sorry I’ll Read That Again. Oddly, though, he allowed some truly egregious puns into Fawlty Towers. One hotel guest, discovering that the salt cellar is full of sugar complains that he has just sprinkled it ‘all over the plaice’. ‘All over the place?’ explodes Cleese as Basil Fawlty. ‘What were you doing with it?’ Even those who hate puns sometimes just can’t resist ’em. Radio comedy in the Forties and Fifties revolved around puns, because radio comedy has to be about words rather than physical comedy. The biggest post-war wireless hit, Take It From Here — which launched its writers, Frank Muir and Denis Norden, towards decades of TV stardom — contained some famous ones, including the line ‘Infamy! Infamy! They’ve all got it in for me!’ which was later pinched for Carry On Cleo, and delivered by Kenneth Williams. It was an age of much greater censorship, and the BBC were particularly stringent. In 1948, the BBC’s Guide For Writers And Producers, known as The Green Book, placed an ‘absolute ban’ on ‘suggestive references to: honeymoon couples, chambermaids, fig leaves, prostitution, ladies’ underwear and lodgers’. Puns were used to smuggle rudeness into scripts, both in broadcasting and on stage. Everybody from Max Miller to Kenneth Horne used puns to get round the censors. Many of Miller’s are still too rude for polite company and would be banned before the 9pm watershed. Spike Milligan, meanwhile, wrote a character called Hugh Jampton into the Goon Show. Classics: Old favourites Les Dawson (left) and Spike Milligan (right) often used puns . Supposedly, he and Peter Sellers waited for the BBC to cut the line, but the bosses didn’t get the joke, and it stayed in. (The rhyming slang Hampton Wick was a reliable staple of British comedy.) Then there were the Julian and Sandy sketches of the mid-Sixties. These characters were two highly camp and clearly gay unemployed actors who were forever trying out different jobs. The writers, Barry Took and Marty Feldman, gave them puns of exquisite cleverness that constantly tested the boundaries. As lawyers, they claimed ‘we’ve got a criminal practice that takes up most of our time’ — a line delivered in the very year, 1967 — that homosexuality was decriminalised, and a rare example of a pun being used to make a satirical point. Later generations, not subject to the same restrictions of subject-matter, didn’t understand the subversive role of the pun, and came to regard puns as just old-fashioned and feeble. The punning songs of the Two Ronnies were mercilessly satirised by alternative sketch show Not The Nine O’Clock News, and critics regularly used ‘pun-laden’ as a term of abuse. Puns were seen as childish. Indeed, they are usually the basis of the first jokes children learn. Today, the BBC’s guidelines for sitcom writers expressly warn against puns. Which makes it all the more heartening for lovers of the English language, with all its glorious potential for verbal mischief, that in 2013 puns are alive and well and thriving in the stand-up routines of comics like Rob Auton and Tim Vine. But if you think puns are cheap or easy laughs, you’d be wrong. Think of the story of the headline writer on a Scottish newspaper confronted by the news that Inverness Caledonian Thistle had comprehensively beaten a poor Celtic side. This was an unexpected result, and Caley Thistle were delighted. The editor thought about it for a bit, and then wrote the headline Super Caley Go Ballistic, Celtic Are Atrocious. That’s not an easy laugh. That’s genius.","Rob Auton won annual award at Edinburgh Fringe Festival for Funniest Joke .

"A 19-year-old man from Temecula, California has been arrested for 'sextorting' Miss Teen U.S.A. Cassidy Wolf after he allegedly hacked into a webcam in her bedroom and took pictures as she undressed. Jared James Abrahams surrendered to FBI agents in Orange County on Thursday. He is accused of cybercrimes and investigators who have been probing the teen since March said more than a dozen other victims had been identified. Wolf, who was crowned Miss U.S.A. in August after winning Miss California Teen, revealed she received an anonymous email from someone claiming to have taken nude photographs of her using her own webcam. Scroll down for video . Caught: Jared James Abrahams surrendered to FBI agents in Orange County on Thursday. He is accused of hacking into Miss USA, formerly Miss California, Cassidy Wolf's webcam and taking nude pictures of her, which he used to extort her . She said the hacker threatened to go public with images unless she sent him more naked pictures, videos or logged in to Skype for five minutes and gave him a 'special performance' According to the Los Angeles Times, an FBI affidavit alleges Abrahams threatened to transform one victim's 'dream of being a model... into (her being) a porn star' if she didn't do what he said. It's not clear whether this was Wolf as the affidavit does not name the victims. Abraham's home was raided in June and FBI agents seized computers, cell phones and hacking software, according to court records. The newly crown Miss Teen USA came forward in August with new details of the shocking cyber ordeal. Without her knowledge, the hacker, now believed to be Abrahams, could watch and photograph Wolf and contacted Wolf, threatening to go public with the photos unless she gave him a special 'performance.' The college freshman said she was speaking out . against so-called 'sextortion' in order to spread the word and teach . other young women to be careful. 'I was terrified,' she said in an August interview with Today. 'I started screaming, bawling my eyes out. I was on the phone with my . mom, and I felt helpless because I wasn't sure what to do, so it was a . very terrifying moment.' Through an anonymous email address, the cyber stalker attempted to extort Wolf for sexual favors, hence the term 'sextortion.' 'You . would never think somebody would be watching you in your room and this . guy had been,' Wolf said. 'The thought of that just gave me nightmares.' These . were the first details the beauty queen has released on her experience . since she revealed she was the victim of cyber crime just after she was . crowned. But the incident actually occurred four months before Wolf won her current title. Sextortion: Wolf says the stalker used an anonymous email address and demanded sexual favors or else he'd release nude photos of her to the press . Shock: Cassidy Wolf, from California, was crowned as Miss Teen USA 2013 in the Bahamas . 'It happened to me when I was a normal girl and it can happen to anybody,' she said. 'The message is to tell somebody.' Wolf immediately called her mom, who reported the incident to police. The FBI quickly took over the case. The Temecula, California native now travels the country to tell her story and warn other teenagers about cyber-crime. 'The longer it goes on, the worse it will get, so if you can get the word out,' she urged. 'Talk to the authorities.' Speaking to Today.com, . Wolf initially revealed the crime just after she beat 51 other young . women to take the Miss Teen USA title at a pageant in the . Bahamas. 'I was just a normal girl in high . school,' she said. Around five months ago, she was notified that someone had tried to log into her Facebook account from a different state. She then received an anonymous email from a stranger saying he had photographs of her in her room that were taken when her computer's webcam was hacked. Beauty queen: Months ahead of the pageant, 19-year-old Wolf (left) was the victim of the cyber-crime . 'I wasn't aware that somebody was . watching me [on my webcam],' she said. 'The light [on the camera] . didn't even go on, so I had no idea.' She would not provide further details of the nature of the photographs, citing the ongoing federal investigation, but told Fox that they captured things you would do 'in the privacy of your own room'. She added the stranger tried to extort her, saying that the photos would then not be leaked. 'You just need to be so extremely careful with what you do online nowadays because you never know what people can be doing to you online,' she told Fox. After she was named Miss California, Miss Wolf traveled to schools near her home in Temecula to talk with students about how to protect themselves from cyber-crimes. During her one-year reign, she hopes to spread her story as a warning to others. 'This next year I'm just so excited to be able to share my story . and raise awareness in young teens about what can happen,' she said. Warning: She now visits local schools to warn others of her story and to give tips in online safety . She said that people can protect themselves by changing their passwords frequently and deleting browsing history regularly. She also suggested putting a sticker over the webcam when it's not being used. Wolf, an avid dancer since the age of two, plans on continuing this work even when she begins classes at the New York Film Academy this year. She said she was 'shocked and overwhelmed' to win the pageant in August after just two years of competing in contests.","Jared James Abrahams, of Temecula, California, surrendered to FBI agents on Thursday and has been charged with cybercrimes .

"A father was arrested and banned from seeing his  daughter after a social worker falsely accused him of abusing the little girl. Jonathan Coupland, 53, was handcuffed in front of his neighbours, thrown in a cell and interrogated for ten hours after Suzi Smith claimed she saw him sexually assaulting his daughter Jessica, then six. The social worker is said to have made the allegation in a fit of pique after the single father criticised the way she was handling a custody battle with his former partner. Arrested: Jonathan Coupland with his daughter Jessica, now 8 . Mrs Smith, 53, later retracted her claims and Mr Coupland has been paid £86,000 damages by her employer, the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass). The public body - accountable to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and funded by his department - has sacked Mrs Smith and apologised to Mr Coupland. But furious about his ordeal, the father-of-one has taken the matter to court, pushing for Mrs Smith to be prosecuted for misconduct in a public office. He is also taking action against the police for false arrest and false imprisonment. Last night, he told the Daily Mail: ‘I was manhandled by three policemen and dragged out of my house in handcuffs. Sacked: Suzi Smith was sacked from Cafcass for falsely accusing Mr Coupland . ‘It was humiliating. My neighbours saw and parents at Jessica’s school turned on me. ‘It was a completely false story of lies but my daughter could have been fostered and I could now be in a paedophile wing of a major prison because of this social worker. I won’t rest until she faces justice for what she has done.’ Former painter and decorator Mr Coupland has raised his eight-year-old daughter alone. Jessica’s Thai mother, Kajchi Jiraekkaphob is an illegal immigrant. He was granted custody shortly after Jessica was born in December 2005 but Miss Jiraekkaphob fought him through the courts for seven and a half years. Cafcass worker Mrs Smith became involved in January 2012, when she visited the family at home in Spalding, Lincolnshire. Mr Coupland claims her initial report, read out during a custody hearing the following week, was glowing. But four months later, she reported Mr Coupland to the police, saying she saw him touch his daughter inappropriately. Mr Coupland believes she did this because he had accused her of acting unprofessionally by contacting one of his character witnesses during the custody proceedings – and he had asked for her to be removed from the case. The father was arrested at his home a week later, on suspicion of sexual assault. He was handcuffed and dragged into a police car in front of neighbours, put into cells and interrogated for around ten hours. His daughter was visited at her school by social services and interviewed by police. Officers told Mr Coupland that Jessica would be put into temporary care but he begged them to allow her to stay with her grandmother. He was bailed but told he could not contact his daughter at his mother’s home. A day later, police said they were taking no further action against him as Mrs Smith had retracted her allegation. He reported the social worker to police and she was interviewed, but the CPS decided not to take action against her. Mr Coupland, who has finally seen off custody challenges from his former partner, plans to contest the decision not to prosecute Mrs Smith at the High Court. She was sacked by Cafcass, the largest employer of social workers in England, for gross misconduct, but only left work six months after making the false allegation. Mr Coupland said: ‘In the meantime she was still working in the courts, affecting children’s lives... It is disturbing that this person is paid to look after the welfare of children. She has done the opposite and got away with it.’ He said he is still viewed with suspicion by other parents at his daughter’s school and that many will not allow Jessica to visit their children at home. ‘Friends have turned on me... I’m still being treated like I’m a paedophile,’ he added. ‘I thought the law in this country was “innocent until proven guilty” but I feel like I have been branded guilty until I prove myself innocent. It will be that way until Suzi Smith is taken to court and proven to be a liar.’ Mrs Smith confirmed yesterday that she was dismissed by Cafcass six months after making her allegation against Mr Coupland. She added: ‘Jon Coupland is a very complicated individual who I believe feels a great injustice has been done to him.’ A Cafcass spokesman said of the incident: ‘We regret that on this occasion our practice procedures were not followed.’ An internal investigation by Lincolnshire Police found its officers were justified in arresting Mr Coupland. Detective Chief Inspector Nigel Storey said police were ‘duty bound to investigate’ Mrs Smith’s allegation, adding: ‘It later transpired that the allegation was not as originally reported to us. The male was released without charge.’","Jonathan Coupland, 53, was accused of abusing six-year-old Jessica .

"The pay divide in Britain between the highest and lowest earners has grown more sharply than in any other high-income country since 1975, a report revealed today. The richest 1 per cent have seen their share of total UK income rocket from 7.1 per cent in 1970 to 14.3 per cent in 2005. Just prior to the global recession, the top 0.1 per cent of top earners accounted for 5 per cent of total pre-tax income. Rising: UK income inequality has soared since 1975 - from below to well above the OECD average. It peaked in 2000 but has been on the rise again since 2005. The U.S. also saw steadily increasing income inequality over the period and, apart from a brief period in the early 1990s and around the turn of the century, was more unequal throughout the period. A value of 0 indicates a completely equal society, a value of 1 indicates that it is perfectly unequal . The research was published as Nick Clegg promised to give shareholders and employees greater power to block excessive boardroom pay in a crackdown on 'fat cats'. Recent figures showed that executive pay . at the biggest firms rose 50 per cent in the last year, taking the . average deal for a FTSE 100 director to just under £2.7million. Only Chile, the U.S., Israel, Italy and Portugal have more unequal societies - but Britain has been closing the gap. Crackdown: Nick Clegg promised to get employees on executive pay committees as he pledged a crackdown on 'fat cats' Research by the Organisation for Economic . Co-operation and Development (OECD) found the sharp increase in income . inequality leaves Britain well above the group's average. Inequality in Britain peaked in 2000 but after falling it has been rising again since 2005. The study - Divided We Stand: Why Inequality Keeps Rising - published by the forum of 34 countries that earn the most, said the annual average income of the top 10 per cent was almost £55,000 in 2008, nearly 12 times higher than that of the bottom 10 per cent, who earned an average of £4,700. This is up from a ratio of 8 to 1 in 1985, the OECD said. Although the wealthiest have seen their income soar their tax rate has plummeted in the same period. In the 1980s the top rate of tax stood at 60 per cent but it slumped to 40 per cent in the early 2000s. The top rate of tax - paid by those earning more than £150,000 per year - now stands at 50 per cent. The report found that globally income inequality has been rising rapidly - even in countries such as Denmark and Norway which are traditionally more egalitarian societies. However, the rise has been sharpest in Britain. Yesterday Nick Clegg said ministers were prepared to bring in legislation to curb ‘excessive and irresponsible’ salaries that bear no relation to performance. Unequal societies: Only Chile, the U.S., Israel, Portugal and Italy have a more unequal distribution of income than Britain. The graph goes from he most equal societies on the left to the most unequal societies on the right in terms of disposable income . At least 150,000 workers have been paid below the minimum wage because of the downturn, the TUC said today. An increasing number of workers feel they have been cheated out of wages because of the perilous state of the nations finances. The union organisation voiced 'great concern' about exploitation as it launched a campaign to raise awareness of basic rights at work. A guide was published giving workers information about enforcement agencies such as the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate and the Health and Safety Executive. TUC deputy general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Tackling vulnerable employment is a key concern for unions. With the labour market struggling to recover from the recession and increasing numbers of those in work facing temporary and insecure employment, action to improve job quality for low-paid workers is as urgent as ever. 'Workers in low-paid sectors such as care, cleaning, hospitality, security and construction can find themselves working excessively long hours, sometimes with no contract of employment. 'Their work can be insecure and they are regularly paid below the minimum wage.' Mr Clegg said yesterday: ‘I think we need to call time on excessive and irresponsible behaviour. 'Just as we have been quite tough on unsustainable and unaffordable things in the public sector, we need to get tough on irresponsible behaviour of top remuneration of executives in the private sector.' In order to combat the problem of soaring inequality, the OECD said: 'Work is the most promising way of tackling inequality. 'The biggest challenge is creating more and better jobs that offer good career prospects and a real chance to people to escape poverty.' It said investing in 'human capital' is vital. 'This must begin from early childhood and be sustained through compulsory education,' it concluded. 'Once the transition from school to work has been accomplished, there must be sufficient incentives for workers and employers to invest in skills throughout the working life.' A Government spokesman said that reforms in the pipeline will lift a million people out of poverty. 'The OECD recognises that the causes . of inequality are complex. As we have seen, just putting billions of . pounds into the tax and benefit system cannot alleviate poverty on its . own and has the perverse effect of trapping thousands of families in a . life on benefits,' he said. 'The OECD rightly points out that . governments need to facilitate and encourage employment of low income . groups - something we are directly focusing on through the Work . Programme and Universal Credit. Rising inequality: The richest 0.1% (bottom dotted line) have seen their share of UK income soar since the 1970s. Likewise, after a fall, the top 1% have also seen a significant increase in their income. Although the wealthiest people in Britain have done well since 1970, the majority have seen their share of UK income decline . 50p tax: Britain has the highest top tax band out of these eight countries at 50%. However, it is down from 60% in 1981. The most remarkable feature of the table is the amount by which the top rate of tax has decreased since 1981. In the U.S. it was 70% in 1981 but just half of that, 35%, in 2010 . 'Our wide-ranging reforms will have a dramatic impact on the poorest families, improving the life chances of children at an early age and lifting almost a million people out of poverty through the Universal Credit.' Rail Maritime and Transport union leader Bob Crow said: 'Far from all being in it together, the rich are getting richer while working families are taking the biggest hit on their standards of living since wartime rationing. 'This Government continues to pedal the lie that we are all sharing the pain while the boardrooms are awash with cash and those whose rampant greed created the crisis are laughing all the way to the bank.' Soaring: The richest 1% took home 7.1% of all pay in  the UK in 1970 - but by 2005 this had risen to 14.3%. Almost everywhere the top 1% have seen their share of the national wealth increase since 1970. In the U.S. they owned the most - 17.7% of national income in 2008, up from 7.8% in 1970 .","Top 1% earn 14.3% of total UK income - double their 7.1% share in 1970 .

"A teenager has been left partially blind after suffering a stroke linked to the contraceptive pill. Georgie Holland, 18, collapsed after being sent home from college and spent two days in bed before her parents took her to hospital, where a scan revealed a blood clot in her brain that was affecting the flow of blood. Doctors linked the stroke to her taking the contraceptive pill Yasmin for two years. Georgie now has limited peripheral vision in her right eye and has to take aspirin every day to thin her blood. Georgie Holland, 18, had a stroke which she thinks was caused by taking the contraceptive pill, Yasmin. The stroke has caused her to partially lose her sight . Georgie spent a week in hospital and has to take daily medication to thin her blood, but she has bounced back to compete in a national pageant in a bid to be crowned ‘The Face of Europe’. Georgie, of Thrapston, Northamptonshire, said: ‘It came completely out of nowhere. I was in a dance lesson at school and started to feel a bit funny and had to sit down. ‘I was allowed to leave, but I couldn’t think clearly and wasn’t sure what I was doing. I ended up walking out of the school and down the road. ‘My dad was passing, on his way to get me, and saw me collapsed in a bush. I didn’t know why I had decided to walk out of the school.’ Georgie’s father took her home where her condition deteriorated further. She said: ‘I spent two days in bed before being rushed to the hospital - a doctor was called out to my house as I was too ill to move. Georgie (pictured with her mother, Kim) was rushed to hospital after she became confused and struggled to see. At the hospital, a brain scan revealed she had suffered a stroke . ‘He was waving his hands in front of my face but I couldn’t see them, that’s when everyone realised that something was terribly wrong. ‘I felt really sick and it was really frustrating because I knew what I was thinking but I was unable to speak without slurring. ‘When my parents and younger brother were shown my brain scan their faces just dropped, I was so worried what had they seen. ‘When I saw the scan I was shocked - there was a black clot in the middle of my brain which had stopped the blood from flowing.’ Georgie said: 'When my parents and younger brother were shown my brain scan their faces just dropped, I was so worried what had they seen. When I saw the scan I was shocked - there was a black clot in the middle' Georgie spent a week recovering in hospital and doctors told her family that they believe the stroke was linked to her taking the contraceptive pill, Yasmin, for two years. It is commonly accepted that Yasmin can, very rarely, cause a patient to suffer a stroke. In 2011 American mother, Joan Cummins, sued Yasmin's manufacturer, Bayer, claiming that a similar pill, Yaz, had caused her daughter, Michelle Pfleger to have a fatal stroke. The stroke left Georgie with limited peripheral vision in her right eye - and she has to take aspirin every day to thin her blood. She also had to re-sit her first year of A Levels. Georgie said: ‘It wasn’t until my best friend came and visited me in tears that I understood properly what had happened to me.’ Georgie now has to take aspirin every day to thin her blood and prevent another stroke but she still hopes to pursue her dream of becoming a beauty queen . Georgie will be competing against girls from all over the country at the event in Essex on September 15, which would see her compete in the finals at Disneyland Paris if she is successful. ‘I hope the event will help me forget and move on from such a horrifying experience. ‘Losing sight in your eye is very scary, especially as it just happened out of the blue. But I’m ready to compete and win the competition. ‘It would be an extraordinary achievement for me if I did.’ Bayer told MailOnline: 'We extend our sympathies to women and their families who feel that they have been adversely affected by Yasmin®. 'At Bayer we take the safety of our products very seriously and we continuously review the safety profiles of our products. 'Bayer investigates reports on side effects thoroughly and collaborates closely with medical regulatory authorities concerning the use, benefits and risks of all products, including Yasmin®. 'Bayer strongly encourages all patients and healthcare professionals to report adverse events to the company directly or to the MHRA. 'Combined oral contraceptives, like Yasmin®, are among the most systematically studied and widely used medical products available today. 'Based on a thorough assessment of the available scientific data by regulatory authorities, outside independent experts and Bayer scientists, Yasmin® is effective and has a favourable benefit-risk profile when used as directed in the Patient Information Leaflet. Bayer fully stands behind Yasmin®.' People over the age of 65 have the highest stroke risk but they can occur in people of any age. Strokes are thought to affect about six children in every 100,000. In adults, strokes are often caused by high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. This is rare in children who are more likely to have a stroke caused by diseases of the arteries, heart disorders, infections and abnormal blood clotting. Children usually recover better than adults from strokes because their brains are still growing. However, they can develop complications such as seizures, weakness and vision problems.","Georgie Holland was picked up early from school after feeling faint .

"A judge has spoken of his ‘utmost despair’ over a £50million engineering dynasty ‘tearing itself apart’ in a costly divorce battle. Susan Shield, 69, is divorcing her tycoon husband Richard, 72, after 43 years of marriage, but fears she and their three daughters face losing millions because he plans to pass the bulk of his business to their only son, Christopher, 35. Judge Sir James Holman  made his rare expression of personal sorrow over the ‘extremely tragic’ case because costs are already set to hit £1million even though it has barely begun. Acrimonious split: Engineering tycoon Richard Shield, 72, left, and his wife Susan, 69, left, are locked in a High Court battle over the future of the family fortune which he wants to leave to their only son, Christopher, 35 . The family is engaged in what he described as ‘intense conflict’ over Mr Shield’s plans for his engineering firm, founded by his late father Arthur in 1949. And Mrs Shield – who has already secured a decree nisi but not yet a decree absolute – is particularly concerned by her estranged husband’s actions because he has had psychiatric problems and been placed under ‘compulsory detainment’. A neighbour last night said that Mr Shield had ‘so much money he doesn’t know what to do with it’. But despite his millions, his main cars are an ageing Range Rover, a 1960s Mini and a pick-up truck. 'Despair': Mr Justice Holman has spoken of his disappointment over the furious legal battle which is destroying a wealthy family . He is currently back in the former . marital mansion next to one of their factories, in Queniborough, . Leicestershire, while Mrs Shield is living with one of their three . daughters – Alexandra, 40, Nicola, 38, and Fiona, 30. Yesterday . at the High Court, in a ruling on the case following arguments about Mr .

Decisions . over the fortune’s future made by Mr Shield some years ago, said the . judge, ‘appear to have favoured the son in preference to the daughters . and to be to the disadvantage of the wife’. At . the end of the hearing yesterday, Mr Justice Holman said: ‘I have to . say, as I leave this very long day, that I do so with a feeling of the . utmost despair that this family could have spent three quarters of a . million pounds just to get to this stage. ‘This . family appears to be tearing itself apart, and it fills the sympathetic . but detached observer such as myself with nothing but despair.’ The case is due to reopen later this month. Richard and Christopher Shield yesterday declined to discuss the hearing.

"When Paula O'Brien and Abbey Donohoe first met at a party thrown by a mutual friend four years ago in Bettendrof, Iowa, the other guests were struck by how alike they both looked. The comparisons even went as far as calling 29-year-old Abbey and 39-year-old Paula sisters - but incredibly, a Facebook posting from last week revealed those first impressions to be not so far from the truth. On Wednesday, March 6th, Paula sent out a heartfelt post recalling how her brother gave up his daughter for adoption almost 30-years-ago, which set in motion a chain of events which revealed that Abbey was in fact that child - Paula's niece. Scroll Down for Video . Abbey Donohoe (left) discovered that Paula O'Brien (right) was her aunt after a random Facebook post mentioning her adoption was posted by Paula last week . The accidental discovery ended almost three-decades of wondering for Paula and her family - and amazed Abbey, who had never even searched for her biological parents. On September, 19th, 1982, when Paula was ten-years-old, her brother and his girlfriend at the time gave up Abbey because they could not bring her up in the way they wanted. 'On Sept. 19, 1982, my very first niece was born and given up for adoption,' reads Paula's March 6th post. 'I know it wasn’t an easy decision for my brother to make, but it was the right one for that baby girl. Hope you can take a moment to read this & be thankful for the selfless sacrifice of adoption. 'I know many families whose hearts are full because of it.' The Facebook post that started it all last week: Paula made this heartfelt statement and soon after Abbey joined the dots . Paula was ten-years-old when her niece Abbey was given up for adoption by her brother - and the family celebrated her birthday every year in her absence . Abbey Donohoe had a happy childhood and never felt the need to try and contact her biological family . Back at home, Abbey read this post and matched up the date, which she knew to be the date that she was given up for adoption. Abbey commented on the post writing, 'You sure it wasn't 1983? Because that's my birthday & I was adopted...crazy!' Immediately, Paula sent Abbey a private message with her parent's names and asked her to check. 'She e-mailed back and said - 'Oh my goodness, it sounds like you're my Aunt!' said Paula to WQAD.Com. Paula O'Brien (left) met Abbey Donohoe (right) at a party four-years-ago and other guests commented on how alike the two women looked .

Reunited with her biological family, Abbey has spent the past week being introduced to relatives that she has never met and her grandmother is due to visit from Arizona to meet her for the first time. 'This is truly a miracle,' said Paula to WQAD.Com. 'We just feel like our prayers have been answered.' 'It was really hard for my entire family to deal with,' said Paula to WQAD.Com. 'We experienced that loss and we never forgot about that baby. We never gave up her. We observed her birthday every year. It never left our minds.' Having known each other through their Bettendorf theater group, the two women were stunned to discover that they were related. 'It was just a surreal,' said Donohoe to KWQC.Com.

"Could Friday the 13th at Ibrox really have been anything other than another gruesome evening for Rangers? Not when Hibernian are the visitors. A third successive victory over this crippled giant saw Alan Stubbs’ side leapfrog their hosts into second place in the Championship standings. True, they have played three games more but there is only one club here with positive momentum. And they don’t wear blue. Having witnessed just one defeat in their last 18 league outings, fans of the Easter Road club will awake on Valentine’s Day with a deepened love of their emerging side. Lewis Stevenson (second left) strikes for Hibernian's second goal of the game against Rangers . Alan Stubbs' side have now overtaken Rangers to go second in the Scottish Championship . Scott Robertson (left) scored Hibernian's opening goal in the game at Ibrox on Friday . RANGERS (4-4-2): Robinson 7; Faure 7, Zaliukas 6, McGregor 6, Wallace 7; Law 7, Murdoch 6, Hutton 6, Vuckic 6 (Daly 77); Boyd 5 (Shiels 78), Miller 5 (Clark 31). Subs not used: Aird, Black, Kelly, Halkett. Booked: Zaliukas, Murdoch . HIBERNIAN (3-5-2): Oxley 7; Watson 7, Hanlon 7, Fontaine 6, Gray 7; Allan 7 (Fyvie 77), McGeouch 6, Robertson 7, Stevenson 7; Malonga 7 (Dja Djede 84), Cummings (Boyle 63) 7. Subs not used: Forster, Craig, Stanton, Cerny. Booked: Allan. Referee: Steven McLean. Attendance: 29,769. For Rangers, the contrast could not be greater. After chanting against a despised board for much of the game, one section of supporters turned their ire directly towards the players. ‘You’re not fit to wear the shirt’ was the damning verdict. After a dire sequence of six defeats from their last ten outings, no one in Kenny McDowall’s squad could consider any slander action. This wasn’t an overall Hibs performance to rank close to those which established a 7-1 aggregate in the two previous league meetings. For long spells, they were pressed back into their own half by their own territory. But that mattered little come the final whistle. Through goals from Scott Robertson and Lewis Stevenson, the Easter Road men had the cutting edge where Rangers had none. And 9-1 over three games still sounds just dandy to all from Leith. Initially at least, it looked as though Rangers were in the mood to find some redemption. Kris Boyd flicked on to Haris Vuckic and he engineered space for a drive that was beaten out by Mark Oxley. Miller seized upon the follow-up but his rising shot was headed off the line by Liam Fontaine. Haris Vukic (left) is on loan at Rangers from Newcastle but could not turn the game in his side's favour . Rangers interim manager Kenny McDowall shouts instructions to his team from the sidelines . There was a freshness about some of Rangers’ early play that was in stark contrast to their recent stale offerings. Another nice interchange saw a Miller right-foot thump from 25 yards tipped over the top by Oxley. Vuckic delivered the resulting corner towards the near post and Boyd glanced in a header that zipped narrowly wide. These were signs of encouragement from a home support that once again left significant patches of empty blue seats around the ground. Further frustration and anguish is, however, never far from the surface in these parts. And Hibs made it bubble up once again by clicking into gear to claim a 19th-minute lead. It was, it must be said, a strike that owed much to the static defending of their opponents. Scott Allan arrowed a pass into the area that found its way to Jason Cummings. He got beyond McGregor too easily but was thwarted as Robinson bolted off his line to save. The reprieve for Rangers was fleeting. Robertson reacted quicker than Murdoch to the loose ball and slotted home with ease. The Hibs fans celebrated with abandon, with stewards and police forced to move in to re-establish segregation at the corner of the Sandy Jardine and Broomloan Road stands after apparent scuffles. Lee Wallace (right) of Rangers takes on Scot Allan and David Gray of Hibernian at Ibrox . Hibernian's players celebrate the opening goal scored by Robertson after 19 minutes of the game . Now the test for the Ibrox players was to respond far better than they did in September. Back then, a Hibs opener was the signal for a full-scale first-half collapse. There was more resistance this time, but not enough to force a leveller before the interval. Their cause was not aided when Miller hobbled out to be replaced by Nicky Clark. And it wasn’t long before the substitute toppled inside the area after linking with Boyd and trying to get beyond Watson. The home fans hollered at referee Steven McLean for a penalty, but the lack of reaction from Clark suggested a slip. As it was, the second period opened in a similar vein. Rangers pressed with Hibs trying to absorb and wait for counter-attacking opportunities. Vuckic went down too easily when picked out by Lee Wallace. The Slovenian had Paul Hanlon at his back but would have been better advised trying to get a shot away. To be fair, though, Vuckic was again looking like a capable performer. A well-flighted free-kick picked out Boyd, whose header drifted off target. Having someone in the side who can take a decent set-piece counts as a novelty for the Ibrox men. Faure got himself on the end of another Vuckic corner, but the Frenchman’s looping header was tipped away by Oxley at full stretch. There was a sense of pressure building, of an equaliser looming but Boyd — making his first start since December 6 — blew a prime opportunity to achieve that aim on 57 minutes. A deep, arcing cross found him in space at the far post but the striker’s header was woefully misdirected. Despite that miss, Stubbs recognised the danger of his side drifting out of proceedings too much out and withdrew Cummings in the hope Martin Boyle would provide new impetus. Rangers' players trudge off the pitch looking dejected after the defeat at home to Hibernian on Friday . Hibernian's players celebrate the three points that moves them up into second in the Scottish Championship . McDowall played his final hand with 13 minutes remaining — and promptly drew the ire of the Ibrox crowd for withdrawing Vuckic to introduce Dean Shiels. Jon Daly replaced Boyd in the other half of a double switch. It mattered little. With nine minutes remaining, Hibs sealed their hat-trick of wins over Rangers with an exquisite goal. Fraser Fyvie, on for Allan, dinked a delightful pass into the area and Stevenson finished first time beyond Robinson. It was, frankly, the kind of finesse that their opponents so dearly lack.","Alan Stubbs' Hibernian side pile the misery upon crisis club Rangers .

"Property magnate Scot Young arrived at court yesterday, a Louis Vuitton overnight bag ready packed, saying: ‘I think it’s going to be bad today.’ Hours later the one-time fixer for the super-rich was behind bars after failing to reveal the whereabouts of his ‘lost’ £400million fortune at the centre of a bitter divorce battle with estranged wife Michelle. A High Court judge lost patience with the tycoon – who counts Topshop entrepreneur Sir Philip Green and Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky among his friends but now claims to be penniless – and jailed him for six months for ‘flagrant and deliberate’ contempt of court. Final kiss: Scot Young, 51, arrived at the High Court in London with his new girlfriend Noelle Reno, 29 . Jailed: Scot Young, pictured right outside court today, has been jailed for contempt of court for hiding details of his finances during the ongoing divorce battle with his estranged wife Michelle, pictured left . Before being led away in handcuffs to . London’s Pentonville Prison, Young, 51 – who was allowed a kiss and . embrace with his 29-year-old girlfriend Noelle Reno – said: ‘This is a . sad day for British justice.’ Miss Reno, a model who lives with him . in a luxury South Kensington flat and was once engaged to banking heir . Matthew Mellon, said: ‘We were expecting him to be sent down, but it is . still very upsetting for me.’ However Mrs Young, who claims her . husband has up to £2billion hidden abroad and still enjoys a champagne . lifestyle, said: ‘All I want is justice.’ Speaking outside court, the . 48-year-old mother of their two daughters added: ‘What other choice do . we have when someone has not complied with court orders and is in . contempt of court and is trying to leave me and my children destitute?’ Support: Mr Young's girlfriend, Noelle Reno - a model and TV presenter -  was pictured outside the High Court where her boyfriend was jailed for six months . Covered up: Model Noelle Reno left the High Court in London with her eyes covered by a pair of Ray-Bans after hearing her boyfriend Scot Young was being sent to prison . The Youngs have been locked in one of Britain’s most acrimonious divorce fights since separating more than six years ago. They previously lived a lifestyle of . unimaginable luxury, owning fine homes in Britain – including six . mansions in Belgravia – fabulous cars and a yacht in Monaco. They travelled by private jet, and for her 40th birthday Young bought his wife £1million worth of Graff diamond jewellery. Mrs Young left him in 2006, claiming . their ‘volatile and unhappy’ marriage had become unbearable. Three years . later a judge ordered him to pay her £27,500 a month maintenance. Young said he was left bankrupt and . penniless after the collapse of a Moscow deal, which cost him his entire . £400million fortune virtually overnight, and has paid nothing, with . arrears now close to £1million. Mrs Young's lawyers argued that Mr Young, pictured left at the Outside in Chelsea art exhibition in October last year and right at Boujis 10th Anniversary Party in South Kensington in September last year, appeared to be living a lifestyle 'consistent with considerable wealth' In 2009 he was found guilty of . contempt of court and given a suspended six-month jail sentence when he . was unable to provide the High Court with any paperwork to explain what . happened to his fortune. Mrs Young’s lawyers had asked the . court to jail him for breach of a judge’s order last October to finally . reveal full details of his assets. The tycoon claims to be existing on . cash hand-outs from friends. He said Mrs Young was trying to get him . jailed out of ‘malice’ and he had ‘done everything in my power’ to . answer questions about his finances. He said he had recently been . ‘detained’ under mental health legislation, and claimed he had been . harassed by eight private detectives instructed by his wife. 'Going from party to party': Scot Young pictured with his girlfriend Noelle Reno at the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in Cowdray Park, West Sussex, in July, left, and at the The Faberge Egg Hunt Champagne Countdown Party, London, in January last year, pictured right . But Edward Fitzgerald, QC, for Mrs . Young, said there was ‘absolutely no explanation’ about where the money . had gone, and that while pleading poverty Mr Young seemed to be living a . lifestyle ‘consistent with considerable wealth’. He added: ‘He is going . from party to party with champagne glass in his hand and his current . girlfriend, some supermodel or other, on his arm.’ Jailing Young, Mr Justice Moor . described one explanation he had given for not complying with court . orders as ‘absurd’ and said another response was ‘next to useless’. He said Young would serve at least . three months but could be freed at any time if he revealed the . whereabouts of the millions and how he was being funded by ‘friends’. The judge said the Youngs’ competing claims would still have to be argued at a hearing later this year. Mrs Young said: ‘We were together for . 18 years and married for 12. We made this marriage together and I helped . with finances, so why should I just walk away and be left in these . circumstances?’","Scot Young held in contempt of court for hiding details of his finances .

"Fans stood on walls, climbed floodlight pylons and perched in trees. That was the day 43 years ago when little Hereford United took on mighty Newcastle United in an FA Cup replay. A young John Motson, on attachment from BBC Radio to television outside broadcasts, made his way from Hereford’s Green Dragon hotel, equidistant from the fine cathedral and the less august Edgar Street ground, for what was expected to be a small end-of-programme clip. The top-tier deities duly went ahead seven minutes from time through Malcolm Macdonald’s header. But, moments later, Ronnie Radford’s right boot twanged the ball 30 yards into the top corner at the Meadow End for 1-1. It was as sweet a strike as the old Cup has known. Ronnie Radford celebrates after scoring the late equaliser for Hereford against Newcastle . ‘What a goal, what a goal,’ exclaimed Motson. ‘Radford the scorer. Ronnie Radford.’ The hero, wearing No 11, reeled away, both hands in the air. Boys in green parkas and grown men waving black-and-white scarves flooded on to the muddy turf, where, in extra time, substitute Ricky George hit Hereford’s winner low into the far corner. The Southern League no-hopers had done it. This weekend is FA Cup fifth-round time. But Hereford will not be involved in the Cup or, indeed, any fixture. As of December 19 last year, the club, then playing in the Southern League, was wound up by the High Court in London. Hereford fans invade the pitch after a famous Cup victory for the ages against Newcastle . Hereford goalscorers Ricky George (right) and Ronnie Radford (left) beam after the game . Ninety years of existence in the lower reaches of English football had ended. Today the Edgar Street ground, in the centre of the city, is a crumbling relic. Addison’s Bar is billed as ‘Open All Day’ but is now closed permanently. The Radford Function Suite is similarly unused. An A4 piece of paper on the black door under the club badge announces that the ground, as of this month, has returned to its landlords, Herefordshire Council. With its corrugated fencing and lanky old floodlights, Edgar Street contrasts with the soulless, recently-built shopping centre — comprising Waitrose, TK Maxx and Debenhams — near the site of an old cattle market. Peering through a gap in the Edgar Street gates is Brett Parker, a former art teacher. He and his wife Julia, from rural Lydbury 40 miles away, were regular visitors here in Hereford’s footballing days. ‘We came for a day out,’ said Parker. ‘I would go to the football and Julia would go to the shops. Then we would meet afterwards at five and go for a curry. What has happened here is bad, sad and mad.’ 43 years after their famous FA Cup victory against Newcastle, Hereford went out of business . On December 19 last year, Hereford, then playing in the Southern League, was wound up by the High Court . On the off-white wall at the Meadow End written in red ink and capital letters are the words ‘Lonsdale Out’, which gets us into the nitty-gritty of this sorry tale. Andy Lonsdale was Hereford United’s last owner. The club was wound up when, despite their lawyers claiming Lonsdale could prove he had £1million to pay creditors led by HMRC, he was unable to get to court because he was supposedly stuck in traffic. For all their FA Cup heroics, Hereford United always had less cash than cachet. But while Graham Turner, the long-serving former manager, owned the club he turned a profit through good husbandry. Turner sold his majority shareholding to David Keyte, a local businessman, in 2010. From a position of solvency, the club made trading losses of about £1.5m over the next four years. The rot had set in. Then, last May, Keyte sold to Tommy Agombar, an Essex businessman who was mistrusted by fans as the guardian of a club that is situated on prime city development land. He had a conviction for lorry theft that meant he was later barred under the FA’s owners’ and directors’ test. Hereford United has gone after 90 years in existence and the gates are locked at Edgar Street . So the club briefly fell into the hands of Alan McCarthy, of Alpha Choice Finance. He was invisible, rarely if ever at games. He was soon succeeded by Agombar’s former adviser Lonsdale, from the construction and waste disposal industries, who had previously been convicted of dumping waste illegally. By now the club were in a dire mess. Off the field, they were expelled from the Conference for failing to pay a £350,000 bond, while former manager Martin Foyle was suing them for unpaid wages. On the field, it was mayhem. Unable to play in the Conference, they entered the Southern League for the 2014-15 season, using 46 players in the five months prior to liquidation. Some of the squad came from Spain, France, Georgia, America and Australia, all chasing the dream of a professional football career that was sold to them in an aggressive recruitment drive. They were paid sometimes as little as £50 or £60 a week, cash in hand. Some even slept in the Starlite function room. Although North Walian striker Cory Williams, now at Chester City, midfielder Billy Murphy, who joined Bristol City, and local boy Jarrod Bowen, who moved to Hull City, found a life in football beyond Hereford, many more players disappeared into the ether as quickly as they had appeared from nowhere. So what next? Herefordshire Council, themselves in debt, are committed — at least until the elections in May — to trying to resurrect the club at Edgar Street. Hereford lost 2-0 to Aston Villa in 2011 in the second-round of the League Cup . They have ‘invited expressions of interest’ to take on the tenancy, albeit only for two and a half years. The deadline for bidders is next Thursday, with the Council due to select who takes over the ground by March 1, the FA’s deadline for participation next season. Rumours in Hereford say there could be three bidders, though only one is in the open: a 50-50 split between the Supporters’ Trust and a group of local businessman led by Jon Hale, who made his money from polythene plant pots. Hale and his group say they are ready to commit £150,000. The Trust, whose membership of 1,700 makes their backing crucial to any bid prospering, have about £30,000 in the bank but say they could quickly raise more funds if the Council chooses them. Martin Watson, the Trust’s vice-chairman, said: ‘We are glad the last owners have gone. We don’t see it as the end for football in Hereford.’ If the bruised supporters should succeed with a phoenix club, it will be called plain Hereford Football Club and probably rejoin in the fifth tier of non-League football, the Midland Premier League. ‘A lot of work needs to be done, but we are confident we can do it,’ said Watson. He and fellow fans can take inspiration from the old club’s motto: ‘Our greatest glory lies not in never having fallen, but in rising when we fall.’","Hereford, then a Non-league club, beat mighty Newcastle in the FA Cup .

"Steven Nzonzi has just been reminded of his role in a TV advert for Venky’s chicken. It was the summer of 2011 and Blackburn’s players were filmed eating platefuls of the stuff in the dressing-room at Ewood Park to promote the club’s new Indian owners. The final scene features captain Ryan Nelsen licking his fingers as he leads his team down the tunnel, as if this was a perfectly normal pre-match routine. Mention of that last bit brings a burst of laughter from Nzonzi, his Gallic calm giving way to a fit of the giggles. Steven Nzonzi has started every Premier League game for Stoke City this season . The midfielder joined the Potters from Blackburn in 2012 following relegation to the Championship . ‘When you think about it that’s really weird, especially as we weren’t doing very well on the pitch,’ says the French midfielder. ‘I don’t get what that was all about. But you think, “yeah they’re new owners and they will do something amazing for the club” so you just follow what they say.’ Venky’s had arrived a few months earlier talking up the prospect of Champions League football and of bringing stars like Ronaldinho to Lancashire. Instead, here were their players reduced to the role of Ronald McDonald. Less than a year after that advert was shot, the team that Sam Allardyce built had disintegrated and Blackburn had slipped out of the Premier League under his successor Steve Kean. ‘It was really strange,’ says Nzonzi. ‘I don’t really get what happened, even now. ‘The first season there we finished 10th in the league with Sam Allardyce. The second season wasn’t bad either. After that they changed everything – the owners, the manager, I don’t even know why. So many players left and then it was a completely different club. It fell apart. The former France Under 21 international scores with a header the season Blackburn fell out of the top flight . Nzonzi celebrates after scoring against Manchester United earlier this season . Steven Nzonzi has been an ever-present for Stoke in the Premier League this season. In the last three years Nzonzi has started more league games than any other midfielder. Steven Nzonzi - 94 . Steven Gerrard - 89 . Eden Hazard - 88 . Santi Cazorla - 88 . Sebastian Larsson - 85 . ‘Just look at the players they brought in. Obviously they weren’t David Beckham or Ronaldinho, like they said. What can you do? That’s football. But when players leave the club because they’re not happy it’s not easy. ‘When you see a player like Chris Samba not playing anymore and Michel Salgado just disappear, obviously you know the team will fall apart. ‘I didn’t play the last four games. I got really mad in training and had an argument with the manager (Kean). ‘It’s hard as a player when you see everything change and decisions are made that you don’t expect so I got angry. After that I didn’t play and we were relegated. It was a really hard season.’ Nzonzi left Blackburn after three years and joined Stoke City in a £3.5m deal that summer. He returns to Ewood Park on Saturday for the first time in a competitive fixture in the fifth round of the FA Cup. The Stoke midfielder is beaten to the ball by Joe Hart in the recent defeat by Manchester City . Nzonzi flies into a tackle with Thomas Hitzlsperger during his Blackburn days . The nearest he ever got to playing with Ronaldinho was at Paris Saint-Germain where he admired the Brazil star and Nicolas Anelka from afar as a member of the club’s youth academy. ‘That’s when you realise “why not me?”,’ says N’Zonzi. He was raised in the Paris suburb of Colombes – also the birthplace of Manchester City’s Eliaquim Mangala – and grew up with his two sisters and brother. The 26-year-old’s father is from Congo, his mother ‘100 per cent French’. Nzonzi’s performances for Amiens SC earned the youngster a call-up to the France Under-21 national team which then brought him to the attention of Blackburn. At 6ft 3in tall with a languid style and ability to attack and defend with great effect, comparisons have inevitably been made with Patrick Vieira. His old team Arsenal are not the only club to have cast admiring glances at N’Zonzi. Nzonzi admits he still harbours ambitions of play in the Champions League . Mark Hughes has made the midfielder a pivotal part of his Stoke side in attack and defence . ‘I’m tall, I play the same position and I’m French so obviously you can make the comparison but I’m not sure it’s fair because it will be hard to match what he’s done,’ he says. Nzonzi has started every Premier League game for Stoke this season and is a vital cog in the more expansive system implemented by Mark Hughes, being asked to get forward more often in addition to breaking up opposition attacks. Silk and steel. It involves an incredible workload and at the halfway point of the season he had covered more ground – 134 miles in 19 games – than any other player in the top-flight. Despite the laid-back demeanour, however, there remains an impetuous streak. Stoke’s coaching staff have had to tell Nzonzi to keep his emotions in check on the pitch. Off it, he has surprisingly ended both of his two seasons at the Britannia Stadium by submitting a transfer request. ‘I don’t regret that,’ he says. ‘I had an issue behind the scenes, not about the football side. It wasn’t fixed (the first time) but now it is so I’m happy. Nzonzi, pictured being sent off against Arsenal, has an impetuous streak that he struggles to keep in check . Nzonzi says he controls his temper much better now, but the red mist can still descend . ‘I’m laid-back in life but on the pitch I can get really frustrated and emotional, there’s a big difference. ‘I’m really hard on myself, always have been. I don’t like missing passes. I control it much better now but still sometimes I get frustrated really quickly.’ There is no disguising N’Zonzi’s ambition to play at the highest level. He wants Champions League football and has not abandoned hope of a senior call-up for France having turned down Congo on a couple of occasions. ‘When you’re a kid you want to play in the Premier League and then when you’re here you look at the Champions League and World Cup, everybody wants that,’ he says. ‘That’s what makes you dream and go on every day. Your career goes so quickly. I’m 26 already, I was 21 at Blackburn so, of course, I would love to.’","Stoke travel to Ewood Park to face Blackburn on Saturday in FA Cup .

"This is the game that the national team cannot and will not lose. Once again, they have a point to prove. Italy have become increasingly defiant in recent visits to Twickenham, but it is unthinkable that Stuart Lancaster's side will undermine their heroic victory over Wales in Cardiff eight days ago by succumbing to an upset in this second instalment of their RBS 6 Nations campaign. On that basis the focus shifts. What took place at the Millennium Stadium was a be-all and end-all encounter with no wider context required. This time, against a country England have never lost to, the players will be well aware of the need to keep the bigger picture in mind. If these opponents don't generate sufficient edge and focus, the ticking of the clock should do the trick. England scrum half Ben Youngs (left) is calling on his side to maintain the intensity they showed in Cardiff . George Kruis is impressing for England but there are plenty of high quality locks to come back from injury . Mike Brown (left) has improved his kicking game this season while Anthony Watson has excelled on the wing . The scenario was neatly summed up by scrum-half Ben Youngs, who said: 'As a team, week by week, we have to push on. Every game is a dress rehearsal for a World Cup. Italy is a dress rehearsal for a home World Cup. 'We've only got seven games before the first game against Fiji so there are only so many dress rehearsals left and everyone wants to put their hand up and stake a claim.' Such an outlook is crucial to quell any threat of English complacency on Saturday afternoon. While the result may not be in doubt, the manner of the performance will speak volumes for whether the post-Cardiff fanfare of optimism has been justified. 455: Italy’s hugely experienced starting XV have 405 more caps than England’s line-up. 15: England have won all 15 Six Nations matches between the two sides since Italy’s inclusion in the tournament in 2000. 3: For only the third time in his time in charge England head coach Stuart Lancaster has the luxury of naming an unchanged starting XV. On this occasion, maturity will be gauged in the ability to display a ruthless streak; by taking charge against inferior rivals and by clinically dispatching them. On Valentine's Day, the hordes at HQ will expect a massacre and while that is unlikely, they can reasonably demand an emphatic margin — eventually. England have abundant firepower at their disposal, whereas Italy will be physical and resolute, but typically limited. The build-up has been dominated by a determined attempt to avoid a drop-off in intensity, after the high-stakes opener in hostile territory. Billy Vunipola has put the disappointment of the November series behind him and his showing great form . Youngs is alert to the danger of easing off the throttle, saying: 'That is the biggest challenge, to maintain the levels of performance from last week. That is one of the things we have focused on. Last time we played Italy at home, it was 18-11. That reinforces the fact that if you are not right on it, they will cause you problems. We have to back up everything we did last weekend.' England's players know they must be patient. That will require another demonstration of the composure which characterised their triumph at the Millennium Stadium, when an early 10-0 deficit was taken in stride, rather than prompting Lancaster's players to go into headless-chicken mode. Captain Chris Robshaw led the steady, unflustered revival, and many of those who instigated the fightback showed maturity beyond their years. England props Dan Cole (left) and Joe Marler have big shifts ahead of them against the Azzurri pack . All around there were 20-somethings keeping their heads and today their challenge will be to avoid clumsy haste as they search for the Italian jugular. The man tasked with leading the attacking onslaught is George Ford — the precocious 21-year-old No 10 who is thriving at Bath after emerging at Leicester. Youngs is in awe of his half-back partner's qualities. Reflecting on the fly-half's breakthrough with the Tigers, he said: 'I was pleased he was a 10, not a nine, otherwise I might have been the one moving! 'I was fortunate enough to see him come through from the academy at Leicester into the first team and watch him kick on. I don't think I'll see another guy like that come through the system, until I retire. 'He's just so mature for his age, in the way he plays; you'd think he has played more Tests than he has. He is still only 21, but you wouldn't think that when you speak to him and see him around the camp. He gives everyone direction. Guys like that are very rare.' Ford is not the only rare gem available to England. Jonathan Joseph's try-scoring contribution in Cardiff re-emphasised his class as a fast and elusive centre amid the heavy midfield traffic, while Anthony Watson — who also touched down — is delivering on his immense promise as a potent force out wide. Right at the back, Mike Brown's kicking game has given him and his national team a whole new dimension. But for these men to thrive, the England pack must withstand Italy's imposing forwards. That surely won't be a problem for a national team who could field two separate eight-man units of elite Test pedigree. Just as Joseph and Ford and Co in the back line must continue to prosper in order to ward off the threat from challengers for their shirts, the same is true up front. Every man who starts today has someone breathing down it. Joe Marler is on a roll as the starting loosehead prop, but he has Mako Vunipola and Alex Corbisiero keeping him honest. The situation is identical for hooker Dylan Hartley, James Haskell at blindside flanker and for No 8 Billy Vunipola while soon, when the injury backlog eases, there will be a jostle for places in the second row too. That is the World Cup factor today. Above and beyond beating Italy, to maintain their title quest, England's players know that the audition phase is intensifying. The time to make a good impression is running out.","England have won all 15 Six Nations matches between the two sides since Italy’s inclusion in the tournament in 2000 .

"For those who puzzle over how supermodels stay so whippet thin, a former Vogue editor has lifted the lid on the horrific lengths some go to to maintain their wispy waistlines and cut-glass hipbones. Kirstie Clements, sensationally fired from her role as editor of Australian Vogue last May, has written a tell-all book about the fashion industry, claiming some models eat tissue paper to feel full, starve themselves for days on end, spend frequent stints on hospital drips, and are often so weak with hunger they struggle to keep their eyes open. As reported by Georgia Graham in the International Business Times, The Vogue Factor also explains that within the fashion world there is 'thin', and then there is 'Paris thin' - a term that describes the size of a model who has starved their already fragile body down two dress sizes in order to be cast in big oversea shows. Kirstie Clements' book, The Vogue Factor, is a tell-all expose of the fashion industry, and the lengths some models go to to stay thin . In her controversial tome, Clements says she once spent three days on a shoot with a model who didn't see her eat a single meal - and that on the final day she could barely stand or keep her eyes open. She also reveals how an Russian model once told her that her flat mate was a 'fit' model - a model whose body is used by top designers for clothes-fittings - and therefore spent lots of time on a drip. Clements spent 25 years at Australian Vogue - her book's subhead is 'from front desk to editor' - and steered the ship for 13 of them. Her departure was sudden - she was called to a meeting and dismissed, forced to clean her office and leave without bidding farewell to her staff - and she was replaced quickly by Edwina McCann, editor of Harper's Bazaar. Clements describes her sacking simply as a 'regime change' that was part and parcel of the dramatic Vogue narrative, but some critics believe the new book - her first - is her way of exacting revenge on the Rupert Murdoch-owned title.

"On September 12, 1989, Liverpool humiliated Crystal Palace with a record 9-0 thumping at Anfield in the old First Division. But the teams met again later in the season and this time, remarkably, Palace won a thrilling FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park, 4-3 after extra-time. Liverpool went on to win their 18th league title while Palace lost the Cup final after a replay to Manchester United — giving Alex Ferguson his first major domestic honour in England. As Palace take on Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round at Selhurst Park on Saturday, Sportsmail talks to members of the Palace squad for their memories of that incredible season. Alan Pardew celebrates after scoring the winner in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final win against Liverpool . Earlier in the season Palace were beaten 9-0 at Anfield - Ian Rush scores the third goal . GEOFF THOMAS (Palace captain) The league game at Anfield was a nightmare. The last few minutes were particularly torturous. We were 8-0 down and desperate not to let it slip into double figures. Ian Wright was running around crying tears of frustration. It was awful. For us, a side that had just been promoted to the First Division, the match amounted to a real lesson; a crash course in playing football at the highest level. Steve Nicol scored Liverpool’s ninth in the 90th minute. No time to score a 10th at least! But Steve Coppell told us we had embarrassed ourselves when we returned to the dressing room. Being a Liverpool lad it really hurt him. His family had been there for his first game at Anfield as a manager. Defender Gary Gillespie stoops to score Liverpool's fourth goal against Palace in the league game at Anfield . Palace captain Geoff Thomas (left) tries to escape the attention of Peter Beardsley in the FA Cup semi-final . How the two sides lined up for both games in the 1989-90 season . There were freakish elements to the game. Every chance they had seemed to result in a goal. They had eight different scorers. I remember hitting the post when it was 0-0. But then I also remember putting a penalty in row Z when we were 6-0 down! As captain I was so angry, I just wanted to burst the net. I blasted it. Miles over. Had I just side-footed the ball softly towards Bruce Grobbelaar I reckon he would have let it in, he felt that sorry for us. Those were the days when we still had a team bath and John Pemberton broke the ice. ‘I reckon they’ll do OK this season,’ he said, and we all had to duck under the water to keep the noise of our laughter from the manager. It helped us recover. We drew 1-1 at Southampton in the next game before beating Nottingham Forest in our first game back at Selhurst Park. By the end of the season we stayed up comfortably, finishing 15th. Midfielder Steve McMahon fires home Liverpool's second goal after 16 minutes . The only real casualty of that night at Anfield was our goalkeeper, Perry Suckling. I didn’t think he was to blame but Steve responded by spending £1million on Nigel Martyn. Over the next seven months we learned to cope better with the demands of top-flight football. And Steve worked us really hard in training, to make sure we were fit enough to deal with Liverpool come that semi-final. We used to do these cross-country runs and hill repetition sessions in Coulsdon. The place was called Happy Valley, which was a little ironic given how unpleasant training could be. Every Friday we’d play a north versus south game, which could be really competitive. The foreign lads were on our team. They were always close but the southerners weren’t shy in letting us know when they came out on top. Flash gits. Current Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew scores the winner in 109th minute to send Eagles to the final . We went into the semi-final much more confident. Steve wanted us to keep it tight, frustrate them. They were pushing hard to win the championship and he said if we could limit them to a goal or two by half-time, we’d have a fighting chance. We went into the break 1-0 down. Going out for the second half one of the lads cried: ‘Come on, let’s make history’. That day was one of the best atmospheres I ever played in. Before Kenny Dalglish had even taken his seat we equalised. 1-1. Pemberton burst down the right — he was really quick — and put in a great cross for Mark Bright. Then we scored from a set-piece to take the lead. Gary O’Reilly put us in front, only for Liverpool to score twice in two minutes with eight minutes left. One or two of our lads thought we were done but enough of us remained defiant. We felt we were finishing the stronger of the two sides and after Andy Gray equalised we hit the woodwork again before the game went to extra-time. Pardewis mobbed by team-mates after sealing a famous 4-3 win for Palace against Kenny Dalglish's side . Of course, it was Alan Pardew who got the winner — 109 minutes. Great stuff. The lads were delighted for Pards. He was hugely popular in that dressing room. We had some good players but along with myself and Gray he gave the team its engine room. We were a close-knit bunch. Even today we remain in touch. Ian Wright and John Salako are supporting my charity bike rides this summer to raise money for Cure Leukaemia, the charity run by Charlie Craddock, the professor who saved my life. As for Pards, I was delighted to see him become Palace manager. He’s a bit misunderstood. Some people mistake his self-confidence, which you need as a manager, for over-confidence. Alan always believed in hard graft, honest endeavour. It was a quality of the Palace team that got to the FA Cup final that year. It’s a reason why he’s one of the best English managers around today. Pardew clenches his fists as he celebrates in front of the Palace supporters at Villa Park . NIGEL MARTYN (Palace goalkeeper in the semi-final) I can remember leaving the training ground the day before the match, when we went up to Birmingham. It wasn’t just the players, it was people from the training ground too. We passed a church that had a sign that read: ‘With God all things are possible’. The lady who used to give us our lunches pointed it out. We weren’t particularly religious, but maybe it was a sign. On the day itself, Steve Coppell said if we kept it tight we’d have a chance because we had some fit guys. They were the footballers but we were very fit. Liverpool striker Ian Rush finishes past Palace keeper Nigel Martyn in the semi-final at Villa Park . Ian Rush scored and we came in 1-0 down but we got an early goal and then made the mistake of going ahead with too long to go! They switched on and had a spell where they re-took the lead. You had a sense that they thought that was where they belonged and I think they took their eye off it a bit.When you take your foot off the gas like that it’s hard to put your foot back down. When Alan scored the winner it was difficult for me to celebrate. I’m inwardly celebrating but then that’s replaced by having to make sure we don’t concede. That final 11 minutes? The longest 11 minutes of my career. Martyn went on to play for Leeds and Everton in the Premier League after seven years at Palace . MARK BRIGHT (Scored for Palace in the semi-final) After the 9-0 game, Ronnie Whelan asked Geoff Thomas: ‘Can I ask you a serious question? Do you train with a ball or do you just run?’ Fast-forward to later that season and the motorway is packed full of Palace supporters having just beaten Liverpool in the semi-final. On the way back from Villa Park, I’m in a car with Ian Wright, who missed the game with injury. We come to a standstill because of the traffic and Wrighty is sitting out of the sunroof drinking champagne. Fans are running out of their cars to hug us. Wrighty had his leg in plaster but he was so happy because he had the chance to play in an FA Cup final. Speaking about it I get goose pimples. At full-time, Andy Gray shouts in my ear: ‘We are going to play at Wembley!’ Mark Bright (far right) joins in the celebrations as Palace team-mates congratulate Pardew . It’s magical. A unique feeling. When Alan scores the winner, I can’t explain to you how it feels. It’s inexplicable. The pendulum kept swinging in the game. To play in it, you knew you were playing in a special game. Just before the start of extra-time, the manager said to us: ‘This is your time, you have to grasp it. You’re fitter, younger and hungrier.’ And he was right, it was our day. During the final 10 minutes, I just kept asking the referee: ‘How long left?’ You’re just thinking to yourself: ‘No-one make a mistake.’ You try to block Wembley out, but you can’t help it. One headline the next day read: ‘The best day’s TV since man stepped foot on the moon.’ Wow.

"Idea: Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle is understood to be spearheading the move . A damaging split has opened in Ed Miliband’s top team over a controversial plan to commit Labour to renationalise the railways. Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle, who has repeatedly attacked the ‘fragmentation’ of the current train system, is understood to be spearheading the move. But Labour Left-wingers say the idea is being ‘stifled’ by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on the grounds that the party should not make potentially costly spending commitments two years away from the next General Election. One senior Labour MP said: ‘Maria is simply trying to float the plan for discussion, Balls is trying to kill it off at birth. But how are we going to convince the voters if we don’t have any firm policies?’ However, others warned that nationalising the railways was a ‘multi-billion-pound plan’ that Mr Balls was right to block. The row comes amid hints from Mr Miliband that the party will go into the next Election on its most Left-wing manifesto since Neil Kinnock was leader. Well-placed sources claim that Mr Miliband is being urged to capitalise on public anger over rocketing rail fares by considering returning the main ‘Intercity’ lines to public ownership. Merseyside MP Ms Eagle has repeatedly . refused to rule out nationalising the main rail lines, sold off under . the Tory Government of John Major in the 1990s. Example: Labour candidates pressuring Ed Miliband said more franchises should be run like the publicly-owned East Coast line . Labour MPs suggested that Mr Miliband – dubbed ‘Red Ed’ by critics for being too Left-wing – was privately sympathetic to the rail plan. One said: ‘I suspect Miliband quite likes it. After all, passengers are getting royally screwed by the private train companies as it is, so why would it be so unpopular?’ Last night, Tory MP Jason McCartney said: ‘Rail privatisation has achieved massive improvements in infrastructure and service, with passenger numbers way up. Any attempt to reverse that would be hugely costly for the taxpayer.’ A spokesman for Ms Eagle said there had been no decision about  whether lines should be nationalised, and denied there had been any rows with the Shadow Chancellor over future policy.Mr Balls declined to comment.","Shadow Transport secretary Maria Eagle thought to be leading move .

"The Australian government is facing a lawsuit that could cost billions after tobacco giant Philip Morris instigated legal action over the incoming law forcing cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging. The controversial law, which comes into effect from late next year, is being closely watched by other governments in Europe, Canada and New Zealand as they consider similar moves. But the legislation change has angered tobacco firms who are worried that it may set a global precedent and by infringing on trademark rights as all images and logos are wiped off the packets. Warnings: Posters issued by the Australian Department of Health as it counts down to the tobacco packaging change contested by the Philip Morris lawsuit . 'The government has passed this legislation despite being unable to demonstrate that it will be effective at reducing smoking and has ignored the widespread concerns raised in Australia and internationally regarding the serious legal issues associated with plain packaging,' said a spokesman for Philip Morris. Under the law, cigarettes, pipe tobacco and cigars have to be sold in olive green packs free from branding, but carrying graphic health warnings, from December 2012. Tobacco export countries including Nicaragua, Dominican Republic and Ukraine have warned they may also challenge the laws under global trade rules, while Philip Morris said it had launched international legal action that could trigger compensation claims worth billions of dollars. The international action is being brought by Philip Morris Asia Ltd, Hong Kong, the owner of the Australian affiliate, through a notice of arbitration under Australia's Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong. Aussie rules: Under the new law, cigarettes, pipe tobacco and cigars have to be sold in olive green packs free from branding . Philip Morris was also expected to launch separate domestic legal action when the laws received final administrative approval, while British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco were also planning to challenge the laws in Australia's peak High Court. Mock-up: An image from the U.S. imagining how to new style packets may look . 'We are looking to go to the High Court after royal assent. We think probably in the next week or two weeks,' BATS spokesman Louise Warburton said. Australia's Health Minister Nicola Roxon, speaking after parliament's lower house approved laws already passed by the upper house Senate last week, demanded tobacco companies respect the will of the parliament. 'The government has received comprehensive legal advice about this matter and are confident with our position,' said Roxon. 'Big tobacco is ignoring the will of the Australian parliament and is prioritising their profits over the lives of everyday Australians with this action.' In 2005 the World Health Organization urged countries to consider plain packaging, and estimated that there are more than one billion regular smokers worldwide, with 80 per cent of them in poor countries. The Himalayan nation of Bhutan banned the sale of tobacco outright earlier this year. Industry . analysts say tobacco companies are worried that plain packaging could . spread to important emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and Indonesia, . and threaten growth there.   | . Tobacco fields: The industry claims to be worried that plain packaging law could harm emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and Indonesia, and threaten growth there . Legal experts have predicted both legal and WTO challenges to fail, as intellectual property rights agreements give governments the right to pass laws to protect public health. Conservative opposition MPs, while backing the laws, urged Roxon to accept a three month moratorium on prosecutions and the enforcement of heavy fines for small tobacco sellers to give them time to adjust to the possible impact on sales. Australia already bans tobacco advertising, smoking in public buildings and the public display of cigarettes in shops. In some states, it is illegal to smoke in a car if a child is a passenger. Australia wants to cut the number of people who smoke from around 15 per cent of the population to 10 per cent by 2018. Health authorities say smoking kills 15,000 Australians each year with social and health costs of around $32billion. Australia's tobacco market generated total revenues of around $10billion U.S. in 2009, up from $8.3 billion U.S. in 2008, although smoking generally has been in decline. Around 22 billion cigarettes are sold in the country each year.","Company seeks compensation for loss of trademarks .

"Three close-knit brothers, who helped care for their aunt as she battled with breast cancer, will be the first people in the world to trial wearable payment technology. Jackson, 26, Julian, 34, and Jonas Tobias, 23, will roam Sydney CBD collecting donations for the National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) while wearing pink ties – with a twist. The ties, which have been created by technology company Brother, have been fitted with a cable that runs through the middle of the accessory and connects to an android device. Jackson, 26, Julian, 34, and Jonas Tobias, 23, will roam Sydney CBD collecting donations for the National Breast Cancer Foundation by wearing ties fitted with Near Field Communication technology . Donors can tap their credit card directly onto a point on the tie which will deduct $10 that will be sent directly to the NBCF while a receipt is issued by the donor's bank. 'For a cashless society, the ties are perfect and $10 goes a long way,' Jonas Tobias told Daily Mail Australia. 'Everyone has, at one stage, had to deal with people coming up and asking for money, and most people are happy to donate, but not a lot of people carry cash on them. 'This way they can just use their card and they can be on their merry way in just a couple of seconds.' The Sydney brothers were inspired to get involved in the Brother For Sisters campaign after helping their aunt Melissa (pictured with her husband) through her own battle with breast cancer . For Jonas and his brothers, breast cancer is an illness that is very close to home. Their aunt Melissa, 43, was diagnosed with the illness in late 2011 and endured months of chemotherapy and a double mastectomy until she was finally cleared of the illness in 2013. 'It was pretty strange to find out about at first. She is a real trooper – you can't find a more upbeat person on this planet,' Jonas said of his aunt. 'There were some rough days, but in the end, she was a lot stronger than we were. The ties that the Tobias brothers will wear have been fitted with a cable that runs through the middle of the accessory and connects to an android device, allowing people to donate by tapping their credit cards to the accessory . The charity is also alternatively selling pink ties for $20 during the campaign, with all money raised being used to help fund research into the prevention, detection and treatment of breast cancer . 'For us, it was just kind of helping her through the recovery. Our mum, another aunt and our grandma gave up a lot of their time to be with her so we just cooked meals and kept their lives as regular as possible, because at the time one of Melissa's daughters was at school and the other had just started. 'We didn't want to disrupt their routine and wanted to take the pressure of Melissa.' All the money raised during the Brother For Sisters campaign will be used to help fund research into the prevention, detection and treatment of breast cancer, according to the NBCF. The charity is also selling pink ties for $20 during the campaign. While the Near Field Communication technology fitted ties have been developed specifically for the NBCF, the invention has plenty of opportunity to expand into other charities in the future as well.","Jackson, Julian, and Jonas Tobias will be the first to trial wearable payment technology while raising money for charity .

"Alyssa Bustamante was 15 when she killed Elizabeth Olten in 2009 . She wrote: 'As soon as you get over the ""ohmygawd I . can't do this"" feeling, it's pretty enjoyable... Kay, I gotta go to church now' Olten's mother called killer 'not even human' at hearing on Monday . A Missouri teenager who admitted stabbing, strangling and slitting the throat of a young neighbor girl wrote in her journal on the night of the killing that it was an 'ahmazing' and 'pretty enjoyable' experience – then headed off to church with a laugh. The words written by Alyssa Bustamante were read aloud in court Monday as part of a sentencing hearing to determine whether she should get life in prison or as little as ten years for the October 2009 murder of her neighbor, 9-year-old Elizabeth Olten, in a small town west of Jefferson City. Bustamante, 18, sat silently – occasionally glancing at those testifying about her, often looking down or to the side – as law enforcement officers, attorneys and forensics experts read aloud her inner most thoughts that she had recorded as a 15-year-old high school sophomore. Alyssa Bustamante (left), then 15, told . authorities she had strangled, stabbed and buried her nine-year-old . neighbor Elizabeth Olten (right) because she wanted to know what it felt . like to kill . The most poignant part of Monday's testimony came when a handwriting expert described how he was able to see through the blue ink that Bustamante had used in an attempt to cover up her original journal entry on the night of Elizabeth's murder. He then read the entry aloud in court: . 'I strangled them and slit their throat . and stabbed them now they're dead... It was ahmazing.' -Alyssa Bustamante's diary entry . 'I just f***ing killed someone. I strangled them and slit their throat and stabbed them now they're dead. I don't know how to feel atm [at the moment]. It was ahmazing. As soon as you get over the ""ohmygawd I can't do this"" feeling, it's pretty enjoyable. I'm kinda nervous and shaky though right now. Kay, I gotta go to church now...lol.' The journal entry was presented to the judge not long after Elizabeth's mother and other relatives pleaded with Cole County Circuit Judge Pat Joyce to impose the maximum sentence. Bustamante pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and armed criminal action last month and faces at most a sentence of life in prison with a chance for parole. The least she could get is 10 years. Elizabeth's mother, Patty Preiss, described her daughter as 'happy, little girl,' when she left her home about 5 p.m. after begging to go play with Bustamante's younger sister. Preiss said she told Elizabeth to be back for dinner at 6 p.m. but never saw her again. Bustamante, who was active on social networking . sites and had the above photos on Facebook. She previously attempted . suicide and was a cutter. Defense attorneys highlighted her troubled childhood as part of their argument about why she . should receive leniency . 'So much has been lost at the hands of this evil monster,' Preiss tearfully said, with Bustamante sitting several feet away. 'Elizabeth was given a death sentence and we were given a life sentence.' With Bustamante looking at her, Preiss said: 'I hate her, I hate everything about her.' The judge cut off her testimony when she described Bustamante as 'not even human.' FBI agents seized the journal from Bustamante's bedroom during a search of her family's home the day after Elizabeth went missing as hundreds of volunteers scoured the rural area around St. Martin's. 'I hate her, I hate everything about her... [She's] not even human.' -Victim's mother Patty Preiss . Bustamante suggested to FBI and the Missouri State Highway Patrol officials that the girl had probably been kidnapped and that whoever had done so deserved to be convicted. At one point, law enforcement officers discovered a hole in the ground in the shape of a shallow grave near Bustamante's home. They testified that Bustamante acknowledged digging it but said she just liked to dig holes. It was only later that Elizabeth's body was found concealed under leaves in another grave in the woods behind the Bustamante home. The victim's mother called the teen, seen here in 2009,  'less than human' at the sentencing hearing . At a hearing in 2009, Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. David Rice testified that the teenager told him 'she wanted to know what it felt like' to kill someone. Defense attorneys Monday highlighted Bustamante's troubled childhood as part of their argument about why she should receive leniency. They referred to numerous references in her journal in the two months before the murder, describing her suicidal feelings and the urge to hurt herself and others. At one point Bustamante had written that she intended to burn down a house and kill all the occupants, but she never followed through with that. On Oct. 14, one week before Elizabeth's slaying, Bustamante had written that she was unable to use her cell phone because the charger had died, which meant she couldn't talk to anyone about the depression and rage she was feeling. 'If I don't talk about it, I bottle it up, and when I explode someone's going to die,' she wrote in a journal that was read to the court by her defense attorney, Charlie Moreland. Prosecutors said Bustamante plotted Elizabeth's death, even digging two holes to be used as graves, then attended school for about a week while waiting for the right time to kill. Hundreds of volunteers searched for two days for Elizabeth before her body was found. Juvenile . justice officials testified at an earlier hearing that Bustamante had attempted to commit . suicide in 2007 and had been receiving mental health treatment for . depression and cutting herself. On a now-defunct YouTube page in her name, one of Bustamante's hobbies were listed as 'killing people'. A few weeks before the murder she tweeted: 'This is all I want in life; a reason for all this pain.'","Alyssa Bustamante was 15 when she killed Elizabeth Olten in 2009 .

"A secret desert camp used by Lawrence of Arabia has been found intact almost 100 years after he left it. The hideout in modern-day Jordan was still littered with spent cartridges and broken gin bottles when a team of archaeologists found it - thanks to an RAF pilot's vaguely-sketched map. It was used as a vital base by Thomas Edward Lawrence, the British intelligence officer who would pass into legend for his guerilla raids against Turkish forces in the First World War. A piece of history: This photograph of an armoured Rolls-Royce helped researchers track down a desert camp (pictured) from which Lawrence of Arabia launched guerilla attacks on German-allied Turks . Find: British archaeologists have found a secret desert camp used by TE Lawrence, pictured, almost 100 years after he left it with a campfire and empty tins of food still intact. His biographer called it a 'time capsule' Immortalised: Peter O'Toole (left) played the war hero in the 1962 blockbuster Lawrence of Arabia . Evidence: The men returned to excavate and discovered spent cartridges and a broken SRD bottle . But the camp would have gone unnoticed for many years more had it not been for a chance discovery in the National Archives. John . Winterburn, an archaeologist at Bristol University, found a . loosely-sketched map from 1918 by a pilot who recalled the camp from . memory after a reconnaisance flight. He . scoured through images on Google Earth to find a part of the desert . which matched the drawing in a 10-year investigation called the Arab . Revolt Project. Finally he . found the small camp, which Lawrence said was 'behind the toothed hill . facing Tell Shahm station', in November 2012 exactly where he predicted . it would be. Accompanied by . project directors Nicholas Saunders and Neil Faulkner, both based at . Bristol, he found ashes still in a camp fire and broken biscuit boxes . strewn across the 100-yard square. Mr . Faulkner told MailOnline: 'When you're talking about the field of . modern conflict archaeology, it's the closest we can get to finding . Tutankhamun's tomb. The relics included a steel hawser clamp for holding or gripping steel rope (left) and gin bottle fragments (right) Haul: The archaeologists found a spark plug from one of the armoured Rolls-Royces driven across the desert . Modern history: Another relic from the camp, which TE Lawrence would go on to describe in his memoirs . Clues: The archaeologists tracked down the ashes from the soldiers' brushwood campfire, pictured . 'What was extraordinary was that we . didn't expect to find anything on site. Our assumption was that we'd go . there and find nothing but at least we knew where it was. 'We were looking up at the landscape rather than down, then suddenly John said: ""I think that looks like a broken rum jar"". 'The whole site was meticulously excavated and recorded and we pieced together fragments of the rum jar into a whole. 'It was incredibly exciting to be there and so very, very close to where Lawrence himself was. 'In . his book Seven Pillars of Wisdom he has this very vivid description of . eating bully beans and biscuits and drinking tea with condensed milk, . watching the sparks rising into the night from the brushwood fire. 'We even found the ashes from that fire. It was astonishing.' Mr Winterburn said finding the camp took him four years from start to finish. The . breakthrough came, he said, when he combined the sketch map with a . photograph of soldiers standing with armoured Rolls-Royces next to a . distinctive hill. Desert: The location of TE Lawrence's camp, which researchers found with Google Earth and an old map . Distinctive: Mr Winterburn told MailOnline he recognised the hill by its unusual shape . Travelling in style: British forces had crossed the remote desert in an armoured Rolls-Royce, pictured . 'I . immediately recognised what it could be and put the pieces together,' he . told MailOnline. 'I then used Google Earth to find a location . precisely, and we logged the co-ordinates. 'We . punched the data into a GPS receiver and marched across the desert, and . there it was, exactly where we predicted. It's easy when you know how'. He . added: 'This camp had been used as a staging post for many for the epic . raids on the Hejaz Railway at Tel Shahm and Mudawwara. 'Scattered in the desert floor . was the remains of their last meals of rusty tin cans from . Lowestoft and fragments of rum jars and gin bottles.' Lawrence's authorised biographer Jeremy Wilson told the Sunday Times: 'It's a time capsule. Unlike on the western front, in the empty areas of the Middle East it just stays there. 'So you get a remarkable picture as if you have walked in the day after they left.' TE Lawrence stayed at the camp in 1917 and 1918 and was joined by British officers who were used to a higher standard of accommodation - having driven across the desert in armoured Rolls-Royces. The period in the desert would see some his most cunning attacks on Turkish supply routes, which provided a crucial distraction to Ottoman troops and allowed an Arab revolt to be victorious. Drama: Lawrence Of Arabia (1962), starring Peter O'Toole (right) as the officer who disrupted supply routes . Legendary: TE Lawrence barefoot in the desert during the campaign. He was just 46 when he died . During the First World War the Turks, allied with . Germany and facing the end of their old empire, were beset by an Arab . revolt which Britain wanted the Arabs to win. Gifted operator TE Lawrence would become a crucial part of that plan. Born in north Wales in 1888, he learned . Arabic on an archaeological dig in Syria. As . he spent three years there in the run-up to the war he became . sympathetic to the Arab people, who had lived under the rule of the . Turkish Ottoman empire for centuries. When . the war broke out in 1914, Lawrence became an intelligence officer . based in Cairo and two years later the hostilities spread into an Arab . revolt. The British Colonel became the adviser to the son of the revolt's leader, Sherif Hussein of Mecca. Renowned . for his cunning tactics, Lawrence's small band of forces hit supply . routes which distracted Turkish troops from the fighting they were . supposed to be doing. His . efforts were vital in helping Sherif Hussein's forces win a victory . which enabled them to establish a unified state spanning large parts of . the Arabian peninsula. The story would later be immortalised by Peter O'Toole in the epic 1962 . film Lawrence of Arabia. After the war Winston Churchill appointed Lawrence as an adviser, but he quit the role as he hated the publicity it gave him. The war hero died aged 46 in a motorcycle accident just three months after he left the RAF.","Academic stumbled upon a sketch map of the camp by RAF pilot from 1918 .

"An extreme islamist group in Syria has posted a video of a British jihadi urging others from his home country to join him. The unidentified man speaks with a London accent when he calls for his ‘brothers and sisters’ in Britain to join in Syria’s civil war. The video has been posted by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a group so extreme Al-Qaeda officially disowned them earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Jihadi recruitment: The video,  entitled 'UK brothers in Syria', starts with a man speaking English with a London accent, encouraging others to join him . The video, entitled 'UK brothers in Syria' opens with a man in a camouflage jacket and balaclava sitting on an anti-aircraft gun, urging others to travel to Syria to fight. 'Dear brothers and sisters. This is a reminder just to show and tell people that jihad is still open, the doors of jihad are still open. 'By the grace of god, we have managed to bring in three or four beloved brothers of Islam. You can see for yourself,' he says in the video as the camera pans to another balaclava-ed man speaking in a British accent. The man, wearing a black North Face jacket, sends his ‘greetings’ from Syria and makes references to warnings from British authorities, should citizens travel to Syria. The man tells his ‘brothers’ to defy authorities and travel to Syria as there will be ‘consequences’ if they don’t. The man in the video, posted by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), urged his 'brothers and sisters' to travel to Syria to fight. Violent message: A second man, he too speaking with a British accent, tells fellow jihadi's to ignore warnings from British authorities . ‘If you do not march forth, then wait for the punishment and the calamity that will befall you’. Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a pro-Al Qaeda Jihadist group that many fear is taking an iron grip over parts of Syria. The group was formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate organisation in Iraq, ISI. Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) tried and failed to establish a Sunni state capital in the country, but held a strong presence in the most important battle grounds - including Baghdad and Salah ad Din - throughout the war. The group lost strength but by 2012 was gathering momentum after moving into Syria, where it became ISIS. Terrorist group: The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), is an islamist group so extreme Al-Qaeda officially distanced themselves from them in February this year . Al Qaeda group: A man holding the flag of Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) walks across a hill in a propaganda video for the organisation . It has since become one of the main Jihadist groups fighting government forces in Syria, and reports claim there are more than 2,500 ISIS members, mostly foreign fighters. ISIS was formally disowned by the central organisation on February 3 for being too extreme. One of its leaders, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been deemed Middle East's most-wanted by the Iraqi interior ministry after a series of terrorist attacks which won him the moniker 'The Ghost'. Widely considered the most radical group fighting President Bashar al-Assad, it is also engaged in a violent struggle with rival Islamist rebels. ISIS controls much of rebel-held Syria in the north, including the town of Azaz, which was seized from the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) on 18 September. The city of Raqqa, with a community of Christians, was the first provincial capital to be occupied by the group last year.","Video posed by extreme islamist group urges Britons to go to Syria .

"When the largest home in Wisconsin went to auction last year, its sellers must have thought they had a real zinger on their hands. But fast forward 12 months, and Ellison Bay Manor, in picturesque Door County, is still on the market. Perhaps given the state of the sluggish US economy, an $8.75million (£5.4m) price tag is too much for even the wealthiest prospective buyers. For that money, they'd get a mansion with three grand guest suites, 10 bathrooms, and a massive 5,000sq ft master suite.

Last October, the 43-room property - which has been empty for almost a decade - was known as Sur la Baie and was put up for sale for $19million. But clearly its new name has not been enough to entice a new owner. 'We had at least half a dozen offers.

She sold the house to an unnamed couple from California in 2005, but the pair became ill before they could move in and never lived in the house. Ellison Bay Manor is currently owned by realty group Jameson Sotheby International Realty, based in Chicago - who have managed the property for six years. The new deal includes the beach house, guest house and 80 acres of land. Penn said that the owners will pay the first five years of real estate tax, and will also donate 4 per cent of the sale proceeds to charities such as the Door County Humane Society, Midsummer Music Festival, the Medical College of Wisconsin, and another charity chosen by the buyer. Given the downturn in the real estate market since that 2005 sale, real estate agents expect buyers with enough cash on hand could make a killing on the sale. Last year, Hilco Real Estate Michael Fine described the house as a mixture of classic style and modern amenities with a breathtaking view of Green Bay.

The house even has its own big screen movie theater complete with concessions stand and ticket booth. Realtors told Fox that the problems in the housing market are not limited to shifting huge mansions. Less expensive holiday homes, such as another valued at around $1.5million has also proved hard to sell. 'This is probably an average upscale vacation home in Door County. It's been for sale this time for about seven months,' said Scott Bader, from Coldwell Banker. 'Right now I think there are only about 40 to 45 for sale. So that's a fairly long market time.'

"A former Utah beauty queen and three other teens took a plea deal on Thursday after being accused of tossing homemade bottle bombs in a Salt Lake suburb. Kendra McKenzie Gill and the other 18-year-olds pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a chemical device, a misdemeanor. The charges will be dismissed after they complete 200 hours of community service. In addition, each was fined $500. Felony charges were dropped as part of the plea agreement. Beauty queen: Kendra McKenzie Gill stands with her attorney before her court appearance in District Court on Thursday, September 26, 2013 . Plea deal: Kendra McKenzie Gill and the other 18-year-olds pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a chemical device, a misdemeanor . In court: Gill topped a slate of nine beauty contestants in June in the Salt Lake City suburb, showing off years of piano training with a Scott Joplin number and taking home a $2,000 scholarship . The defendants were initially accused of driving around last month to toss plastic bottles filled with a toilet bowl cleaner that reacted with aluminum foil to explode. They said it was a harmless prank. No one was injured. The other teens who settled the case . were John Patrick Reagh, Shanna Marie Smith and Bryce Christopher Stone. None of the defendants commented after the hearing. Gill was Miss Riverton until she relinquished her crown after her arrest. Family members and friends of the teens packed the courtroom on Thursday and traded hugs after the proceeding. 'We're just happy it didn't come to a felony charge,' said Steve Reber, a friend of the Gill family. The case was fast-tracked because none of the defendants has a criminal history, court officials said. Gill topped a slate of nine beauty contestants in June in the Salt Lake City suburb, showing off years of piano training with a Scott Joplin number and taking home a $2,000 scholarship. Gill is charged with manufacturing home-made bombs which her and three other teenagers threw from a moving car and people and homes . Kendra McKenzie Gill, 18-year-old Utah beauty contest winner, was arrested on felony charges for throwing bombs . Giving up her title: Gill said it took hard work to win the title of Miss Riverton, and the $2,000 scholarship that comes with it, so giving it all up was a difficult decision . Contestants in the pageant — a . preliminary competition for the Miss Utah and Miss America competitions — . were required to sign a contract certifying they have not been . convicted of a crime and don't have criminal charges pending against . them. Pageant officials can revoke a title if a contestant is criminally charged during her reign. All four teenagers have previously acknowledged they were throwing the homemade bombs 'to scare some of their other friends,' Unified Fire Authority investigator Steve Bowen said in a court affidavit. 'We don't really understand a clear reason for their behavior,' prosecutor Blake Nakamura said earlier this month. 'The reason we charged them is obviously, what they possessed was indeed explosives, and we're alleging they were throwing them near homes and at people, and therefore, had the potential to cause a great deal of harm.' Scene: The teens were found to have thrown the bombs at two residences, including that pictured, in Riverton . Gill called the act a 'stupid mistake' but that she and her friends never aimed the bombs at anyone. 'We didn’t think about what we were doing at the time,' she said. 'We didn’t know that it would get to this point. We meant for it to be a practical joke and never had any intentions to harm anyone at all.' 'They were throwing them at both property and people,' Unified Fire Authority Captain Clint Mecham told KUTV-TV. 'This goes well beyond a teenage prank.' 'They're very caustic, very nasty. So they can cause injury to somebody just if the chemicals get on somebody, much less the fragmentation of the shrapnel damage that can be caused,' Captain Mecham told the television station. 'They can very easily cause serious harm or even death.'","Kendra Gill stepped down from her position as Miss Riverton after her arrest .

His cousin jumped after to help him, but struggled in the currents as well. Scroll down for video . Too young: Erickson Villa, 13 (left), drowned in the Bronx River on Friday. His cousin Wellington Gavin, 13 (right), died Sunday after jumping into the river to save the struggling relative . Emergency responders arrived on the scene around 3:14pm, at which point the boys had been in the water for roughly 30 minutes. One boy was removed at 3:37pm, followed by the other nearly an hour later. Both were unconscious when they were pulled from the water. Villa died that day while Gavin initially improved at Children's Center Montefiore Hospital. However, by Sunday his conditioned worsened so much that his mother was preparing to take him off life support. Gavin's heart stopped on its own before life support was taken away. Emergency responders arrived on the scene at 3:14pm and pulled one of the boy's bodies out about 20 minutes later. The other boy was pulled out an hour after that. Both were unconscious when they were pulled from the water . Gavin was rushed to the hospital but his condition deteriorated by Sunday and his heart stopped beating . Gavin's family have been speaking to the public through their church pastor, Rev Joel Bauza. On Sunday, Rev Bauza announced Gavin's untimely passing and said they his family had decided to donate his organs to science as a tribute to his 'act of heroism'. Rev Bauza also said the family hopes top protect other children from falling prey to the river. While there are signs showing that swimming is prohibited in that part of the park, new boat docks have become a favorite gathering spot of the neighborhood's children. 'The family has a lot of concerns about the park safety and they want to address that,' Rev Bauza said. The family of the two young men are currently fundraising to send Gavin and Villa's bodies back to their native Dominican Republic.

"Al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria have been ordered to target the Queen at British sporting events such as Wimbledon and Cheltenham races. FA Cup matches are also on the list of recommended events, with 'martyrdom bombers' advised to detonate explosives at the final whistle. In a series of recommendations published in the terror group's English-language magazine, jihadists are told to act as a 'lone wolf' and use car bombs for 'killing individuals'. Target: Inspire magazine, published in the Arabian Peninsula, lists events attended by the Queen to target . It comes as it is revealed the top five MI5 and MI6 operations involve tracking British terrorists trained in Syria. More than half the 400 extremists who travelled from the UK to fight in Damascus have returned home, sparking a surge in security measures. Inspire magazine, published in the Arabian Peninsula, lists Britain as Al Qaeda's biggest target after America. It suggests attacks on London's Savoy hotel and French seaside towns popular with UK tourists as places where terrorists can cause 'maximum carnage'. 'Hit two birds with one stone; both the English and the French,' it states, according to the Sunday Times. Wimbledon is one of the tournaments where jihadists could cause 'maximum carnage', the author claims . Specific advice tells readers to detonate bombs at tournaments such as the FA Cup final on the final whistle . 'In the beginning of summer we have . Cheltenham, and [at] the end of summer we have Epsom, whereby horse . races are attended by thousands from around the kingdom including the . Queen.' The author, named as . AQ Chef, adds: 'You have soccer stadiums, especially during Premier . League and FA Cup matches. They have worldwide live [sic] media . coverage. 'The best time is after the final whistle, when huge crowds leave the stadium and celebrate around the entrances.' The twelfth issue of the magazine, published on March 14, . encourages readers to build their own car bomb - which it provides . instructions of how to do - and detonate it outside the hotel. The magazine published by Al Qaeda names Britain as the group's main target after America . It suggests carrying out the attack at 10pm when, it says, 'high profile targets' will be exiting. According to the article, this is 'a perfect place and time to detonate your car bomb.' Home Office minister James Brokenshire told the Sun plots by British jihadists like these are a 'significant and growing proportion of the security services' work'. Last year, 24 people were arrested in connection with Syrian terror; this year there have been 20. Ten charities linked to Syria are also under surveillance after it emerged the head of a Midlands coach firm, Adeel Ali, was pictured with an AK47. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said counter-terrorism officers monitor the magazine closely but would not release details of any additional security measures. He said: 'The MPS Counter Terrorism Command is aware of the website and appropriate steps have been put in place. 'As part of our continued work, we regularly work with, and support, industry and crowded places with a variety of briefings and advice.' Both the Savoy and the company that manages it, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, were contacted but no one was available for comment. Suggestions for attacks include Bastille Military Day Parade and the Louvre art gallery, both in Paris, Sears Tower in Chicago and popular holiday destinations for western tourists, such as the Dordogne. The magazine carries an article about Al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a US drone strike in 2011. In the piece, al-Awlaki is quoted justifying the killing of civilians by saying: 'Soldiers are expected to die… But a civilian is not. So when you you hit the civilian you hit them where it hurts and that is what our tactics are about.' As well as these sort of instructions, the magazine contains practical advice on how to carry out an attack. The Dordogne in France is listed as it is popular with British tourists, as is London's Savoy hotel . The article comes as both MI5 and MI6 angle their top five operations to focus on Syria-trained British jihadists - 250 of whom have returned home. This image emerged this week of a UK attacker calling for people to join him . These include methods of making bombs, which it claims can be made with easily accessible items and are simple enough to be followed 'in the kitchen of your mom.' The magazine's letter from the editor mocks the American government for failing to be able to 'protect its citizen from pressure cooker bombs in backpacks,' a reference to the attack on the Boston marathon in April 2013. It goes on to ask: 'I wonder if they are ready to stop car bombs.'","Propaganda magazine lists London's Savoy hotel and Cheltenham to target .

"Romanian police have launched an investigation after a video was posted online showing people laughing and doing nothing to help as a man and a woman drowned in front of them. The incident this weekend happened when 47-year-old Calin Neagu and his 45-year-old wife Dana tried to cross over the rain-swollen Jiu river in southern Romania. Local police said that divers recovered the couple's bodies from the water several hours later, and are now investigating their deaths. Scroll down for video .

Victims: Local police said that divers recovered the couple's bodies from the water several hours the footage was taken, and are now investigating their deaths. Pictured is Dana Neagu . The video shows Mr and Mrs Neagu trying to cross the swollen Jiu river with their horse and two carts over the weekend. With the horse clearly struggling to drag the load across the river due to a strong current, a fisherman realised that the pair were getting into difficulty and waded into the water. Using a stick, he started beating the horse in the hope it would encourage the animal to work harder and reach the river bank before the current swept the group away. As the three struggled to stay upright, people in a nearby boat filmed what was going on in front of them - appearing to find the situation funny. They can clearly be heard laughing and joking with one another as the couple tumble out of the cart into the fast-flowing water.

"A teaching assistant drowned after he went skinny dipping during a New Year storm and had his neck broken by the force of a 15ft wave, an inquest heard. Harry Swordy, 27, disappeared beneath the giant waves after wading into the swell off Loe Bar, a remote beauty spot near Porthleven, Cornwall, in the early hours of January 1. He was with his sister and several friends when he and two others stripped down and ran naked into the swell, despite sea conditions being some of the worst in living memory due to a force nine storm. Harry Swordy, 27, drowned after going skinny dipping off Loe Bar, a remote spot near Porthleven, Cornwall . The trio were knocked off their feet by the first wave to hit them and while Mr Swordy’s two friends managed to clamber ashore, he disappeared beneath the surface. His sister Grace was waiting with the rest of the group on the shoreline but an inquest in Truro, Cornwall, heard their only glimpse of Mr Swordy was his silhouette being tossed into the air against a wall of foam. Despite a huge search effort in the ferocious conditions, coastguards were unable to find him and his body washed up two days later. His death came as authorities urged Britons to steer clear of coastal areas while the country was pounded by the fringes of the Atlantic mega-storm Hercules. The inquest heard how Mr Swordy and his sister were among a group of 23 friends staying at a nearby bunkhouse for three days to see in the New Year. The teaching assistant, originally from Guildford, Surrey, but working in Newton Abbot, Devon, had a meal and drank about three pints of beer and a shot of tequila. Mr Swordy was with his sister and several friends when he and two others stripped down and ran naked into the swell off Loe Bar in Cornwall, despite sea conditions being some of the worst in living memory . Coroner Emma Carlyon said the swimmers had ignored two warning signs on Loe Bar itself but said she would be writing to the National Trust advising them to put more notices of the dangers up at local accommodation . He, along with friend Jonathan Burgess . and another man, then decided to go for a moonlit swim and ignored . warning signs as they raced into the sea at 1am. Mr . Burgess, a landscape gardener, told the inquest: ‘We drank some alcohol . but I would not say anyone was drinking excessively or drunk. ‘We were running together towards the sea. Harry was a little bit ahead of me so he reached the water first. Friends paid tribute to Mr Swordy in the wake of his death, describing him as an 'amazing character, so full of life, warmth and plans for the future' ‘A large wave came in and I just saw his silhouette, with his arms up, and he just got hit by this big wave. ‘It hit me and we were submerged. It was very shallow at that point but you could feel the drag of the current. ‘I didn't see Harry again. The waves were continuous. We looked for Harry, but there was no sign of him.’ The group began searching the beach and called 999, triggering a massive search and rescue mission involving coastguards, lifeboats and a Royal Navy helicopter from RNAS Culdrose. For several hours the lifeboats battled through the surf and up to 20 rescuers combed the shoreline. Coastguard sector manager Marc Thomas said the sea conditions were some of the most dangerous he had ever faced. He said: ‘I can say the sea conditions at Loe Bar that morning were some of the worst I've seen in my career. ‘Loe Bar is an extremely dangerous place to swim even on a calm day and you should not swim there.’ The inquest heard how the 27-year-old’s body was identified by a tattoo saying ‘Freedom’ on his left arm. A post-mortem found his lungs were . filled with water but there was blood around the injury, meaning he was . still alive when his neck was snapped. Mr Swordy's death came as authorities urged Britons to steer clear of coastal areas while the country was pounded by the fringes of the Atlantic mega-storm Hercules in the early hours of January 1 . Coroner Emma Carlyon said the swimmers had ignored two warning signs on Loe Bar itself but said she would be writing to the National Trust advising them to put more notices up at local accommodation. She recorded a verdict of accidental death caused by immersion in rough seas.

"A man claims he suffered serious emotional trauma at the hands of the federal government after Google auto-corrected his innocent web search into something sinister. When he typed ‘how do I build a radio controlled’ in October 2009, former government contractor Jeffrey Kantor says Google auto-completed his search to read: ‘how do I build a radio controlled bomb.’ Now he’s implicated some of Washington’s top brass in a bizarre $60 million lawsuit that alleges he was fired from his job after the government stalked him and used his co-workers to emotionally abuse him. Bombshell: Jeffrey Kantor claims Google auto-completed his web search to ask 'How to create a radio controlled bomb,' causing the government to harass him for months . Kantor worked for government contractor Appian Corporation at the time of the fated Google search, which he says began innocently as a way to find something his son might like for an upcoming birthday. But after the search, Kantor says his life became a nightmare as the government began to harass him. First he says he was harassed by a good cop/bad cop team of government investigators. He says the bad cop even made anti-Semitic comments to him over the course of five months. According to the complaint obtained by Courthouse News, things continued to worsen from there. Placing the blame: At a time when many Americans are uncomfortable with the government's extensive monitoring tactics, Kantor is claiming to be a victim and wants those he feels are to blame to pay handsomely . Kantor’s co-workers ‘would repeat . back Kantor's private information, including emails, websites he went . to, library books he got from the library, conversations he made in his . house or in his car, phone calls, information about the contents of his . house, and then someone would immediately say that there is a person who . dropped dead from hypertension.’ According to Kantor, these conversations were veiled death threats. The complaint continues: . ‘If . Kantor ever got angry after his private information was repeated back . (by slamming a cabinet or typing loudly on his computer), the . [subcontractor] CRGT and Northrop Grumman employees would tell the same . story about how there was a neighbor in their community who seemed like . such a nice guy, but then went on a murder suicide.’ Usual suspects? Kantor is suing top Washington brass as well as the departments and agencies they head up. At left is director of the CIA John Brennan, James Clapper (center) heads National Intelligence, and John Kerry is Secretary in charge of the State Department . Implicating many: Kantor claims Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Attorney General Eric Holder also had a hand in the harassment he received from the government. He now wants retribution in the form of $60 million . Every day for three months, Kantor claims he would have to choose to either react to the harassment or ignore it. But if he ignored it, ‘they would instead spend the hour talking about how people drop dead from hypertension.’ He says he was fired from Appian, but that the treatment followed him to other firms. Kantor even claims the government attached a GPS tracker to his car as part of the stalking. He’s now suing the state department and Secretary John Kerry, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the CIA and Director John Brennan, the Defense Department and Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Attorney General Eric Holder. Kantor is asking for ‘$13.8 million in compensatory damages and $45 million in punitive damages,’ according to his filing. He’d also like the government to stop stalking him.","Jeffrey Kantor was a Washington-area government contractor but says he was fired after extensive harassment by the government .

"A bitcoin investor who forgot he bought £17 of currency four years ago is sitting on a small fortune now worth more than half a million pounds. The meteoric rise in the internet-based money has meant that within the space of four years, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch has made a huge profit, the Guardian reports. He invested 150 kroner (£17) in 5,000 bitcoins in 2009, after discovering them while writing a thesis on encryption. Currency: Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency used over the Internet that is gaining in popularity worldwide. A bitcoin is now worth about £122 . He forgot about them until he started seeing media coverage of the digital currency in April this year. Bitcoins are stored in encrypted wallets secured with a private key. Mr Koch had forgotten his password but when he eventually remembered it he was stunned by how much they had jumped in value. 'It said I had 5,000 bitcoins in there. Measuring that in today's rates it's about NOK5m (£551,000),' Mr Koch said. In April 2013, the value of bitcoin peaked at £165 before crashing to £30. When Silk Road, the online drugs marketplace, was stopped, the value of bitcoins took another tumble. A bitcoin is now worth about £122. Koch changed up 1,000 bitcoins and had enough kroner to buy an apartment in Toyen, one of the Norwegian capital’s wealthier areas. Oslo: Mr Koch changed up 1,000 bitcoins and had enough kroner to buy an apartment in Toyen, one of the Norwegian capital's wealthier areas . The currency is usually bought using an 'exchanger', although this can be difficult due to anti-money laundering laws. A user can then withdraw money by sending the bitcoins back to an exchanger for cash. The Pembury Tavern pub in Hackney, London, has become the first to accept bitcoins and today the world's first bitcoin ATM went online in Vancouver, Canada. It scans a user's pam before letting them buy or sell bitcoins for cash. A small group of people can generate bitcoins by 'mining' for them – a process that requires computers to perform the calculations needed to make the digital currency work, in exchange for a share of the built-in inflation. Mining is time-consuming and expensive due to the way the currency is designed. In August this year, Germany recognised bitcoin as a 'unit of account', allowing the country to tax users or creators of the digital currency.

"Chicago police used excessive and brutal force on a 5'2"" woman and told her they'd ship her back to 'where the f*** she came from,' according to a lawsuit filed by a Chinese-born American citizen on Wednesday. Shocking video shows Jianqing 'Jessica' Klyzek being struck in the head as the non-native English speaker struggled against police, most of them in plain clothes, as they raided the tanning salon where Klyzek worked last summer. Klyzek is suing the City of Chicago and its police department alleging police brutality and a hate crime and with trying to frame the salon manager by claiming she was the one who assaulted them. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Shocking video purports to show racist Chicago police officers screaming at a tanning salon manager during a vice bust gone wrong . Allegations: Klyzek's lawsuit alleges that she was handled by police with excessive force and mistreated because of her ethnicity . Police had entered the spa last July after claiming one of its employees--not Klyzek--offered an undercover cop sex in exchange for money in a back room. Klyzek walks into view of the camera as one of the officers grabs her by the arm. Her attorney Torreya Hamilton admits her client reacted emotionally and footage shows her struggling as she dragged by her arm. But when she's cuffed and on the ground, an officer annoyed by her screaming can clearly be seen to smack her on the back of the head. Another officer then goes on a tirade as his fellow cops are presumably raiding the back. 'You're not . f***ing American,' yells the officer identified in the suit as Gerald . Di Pasquale. 'I'll put you in a UPS box and send you back to wherever . the f*** you came from!' The yelling continues after Klyzek tells officers, 'I'm a citizen, okay?': . 'No, . you're not! You're here on our borrowed time. So mind your f--king . business before I shut this whole f--king place down. And I'll take this . place and then whoever owns it will f--king kill you because they don't . care about you, OK? I'll take this building. You'll be dead and your . family will be dead,' the officer says. Racism? While she screamed and demanded to know what she'd done, footage from the incident clearly show an officer screaming threats and allegations that Klyzek, who is a naturalized citizen, is not an American . An officer can clearly be seen striking the 5-foot-2 woman in the back of the head as she was kneeled down in handcuffs and facing the floor . Another officer is heard to yell: 'Can I just Tase her? F*** it. I can Tase her 10 f***ing times.' The officer who allegedly struck Klyzek is identified in the case as Frank Messina. Besides Messina and Di Pasquale, the case names Sandra Stoppa, Daniel Sako, Michael Iglesias, Sergio Flores, D. Puhar, T. Jackson, Eugene Sledge and Kenneth Corcoran as defendant officers and alleges they attempted to frame Klyzek by claiming she's the one who assaulted them. However, the case against Klyzek was thrown out for lack of evidence and because prosecutors dropped charges when they saw the video. The sex worker who allegedly propositioned an officer has also since had her misdemeanor conviction expunged. Hamilton is seeking to get the officers fired.","Jianqing 'Jessica' Klyzek is seen in surveillance photo during a vice raid on a tanning salon from last summer cowering as police berate her .

"For most people, all they require from their toilet is that it flushes without blocking itself. But now a new high-tech loo has been launched which includes a heated seat, a massage function, and two 'sanitising nozzles' which it claims eliminates the need for toilet paper. It even includes a lid which automatically opens and closes for you. However, $10,000 (£6,000) for most people it will remain little more than a pipe-dream. Scroll down for video . The Neorest 750H will lift its own lid, has a massager built into the seat, uses sanitising spray nozzles so there is no need for toilet paper and will even flush itself when you're done . The designers of the TOTO Neorest 750H claim it is inspired by modern architechture, with the seat placed exactly 17in off the floor to make it as comfortable as possible. The seat itself includes two stainless-steel spray nozzles which provide 'the ultimate in personal cleansing', with a built-in dryer for your delicate areas. There is a deodoriser to get rid of any unpleasant smells, and the seat will even remember your daily routines and use that information to mist the bowl before and after use, 'preventing waste’s adherence'. Special chemicals used in the bowl mean it has a 'pearlescent' appearance. The chemicals also react with a UV light in the lid meaning it cleans itself while closed without the need for water . Using a high-tech flushing system means that even those living in penthouse suites with low water pressure can get a good rinse . The sanitising nozzels will also clean themselves and, using a remote control, people can even adjust the water pressure and temperature for maximum comfort. The seat also has temperature control which can be adjusted from 88-99F and includes a massage function. As if all that wasn't enough to tempt you, the lid has a built-in UV light which reacts with a coating on the toilet to clean it while it is not being used. An extravagant flushing system means even those living in penthouse suites with low water pressure get a thorough flush using less water than a conventional loo. For those working on a tighter budget, there is always the Swash 1000 seat, which comes with a lot of the same features, clips on to any toilet, and costs $400 .

"Premier Inn has become the latest company to remove thousands of beef burgers from its restaurants over fears they may be contaminated with horse meat as its supplier suspends operations. The firm at the centre of the horse meat scandal - Irish company ABP - has failed to give the UK hotel chain assurances that their stock has not been contaminated. It comes as burger supplier announced a temporary closure at its Silvercrest processing plant in Co Monaghan after new tests confirmed the contamination was rife. Scroll down for video . Food chain? A customer rode this horse to a Tesco store in Dublin last year, did a shop, then took the - possibly relieved - animal home . A Premier Inn spokesman said: 'We take . the quality of our food very seriously. We asked our supplier, . Silvercrest, to give us assurances that the beefburger product supplied . to us was not affected by this issue. 'After . they initially gave us this assurance they have subsequently told us . they cannot now give us this guarantee. As a precautionary measure, we . therefore immediately took the decision to remove their products from . our menus. 'As we use . two beefburger suppliers we have been able to quickly replace all our . Silvercrest stock through our alternative provider.' ABP . said fresh tests from burgers produced in the last two weeks confirmed a . European processing company – believed to be in Spain or the . Netherlands – as the source of contamination. The . unnamed company supplied a meat bulking protein powder that was used in . burgers made for supermarkets in Britain and Ireland. ABP also used the ingredient in the Yorkshire factory run by its Dalepak subsidiary. Burger: More than ten million burgers have been removed from sale, including more than 100,000 made at the Yorkshire factory of Dalepak . Empty shelves: Tesco has taken its frozen burgers off the shelves as some contained 29 per cent horse meat . Last night the company said: ‘To date, ABP Food Group investigations have centred around two third party EU suppliers. 'Following . receipt of this evening’s Irish Department of Agriculture results, we . believe that we have established the source of the contaminated material . to one of these suppliers. 'However, . because equine DNA has been found in finished products tested this . week, we have decided that the responsible course of action is to . suspend all production at the Silvercrest plant in County Monaghan with . immediate effect. 'This week’s production has not been released from the . plant.’ The company also . supplies Burger King but last night insisted there was no chance of the . fast food chain's products being contaminated as they are made and stored separately at the plant. It . said: 'We would like to reiterate that all Burger King products . produced by us are stored separately and manufactured on an independent . line. Cover-up? The Food Standards Agency is in charge of handling Britain's response to the scandal. However, the official watchdog has made efforts to limit the scope of its investigation . Bare: The frozen burger section of this Sainsbury's in Colchester stands empty today after the chain became one of many to pull its products . There is no evidence of any contamination of raw material used for the manufacture of any Burger King products.' Irish . agriculture minister Simon Coveney said an investigation will continue . to establish conclusively the source of the equine DNA. In . Britain, watchdogs are under pressure to test all supermarket frozen . beefburgers for the presence of horse meat amid fears of an official . cover-up. The demand . came after it emerged that a raft of big brand burgers and grills sold . under the Ross, Dalepak, Flamehouse and Thomas Adams names are being . withdrawn. More than ten . million burgers have been removed from sale, including more than . 100,000 made at the Yorkshire factory of Dalepak, which supplied . Iceland. Labour says . comprehensive food tests are needed to let families know how far horse . meat contamination has spread into the food supply. The Government has . put the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in charge of handling Britain’s . response to the scandal, which was uncovered in Ireland. However, the official watchdog has made efforts to limit the scope of its investigation. Not for sale: Tesco in Bristol had removed all its own brand burgers from sale . The manufacturers involved also made cheap frozen burgers for Asda (pictured), Sainsbury's, and the Co-op among others . Iceland has revealed that its frozen burgers contaminated with horse DNA will be converted into fuel. The supermarket has so far withdrawn more than 2,000 units following the FSAI’s damning report. Iceland said useful organic materials from the waste animal tissue would be released through a ‘rendering’ process and converted into fuel. Sainsbury’s has also removed one line from its shelves, although it was not implicated in the report. But a spokeswoman ensured that the meat would not go to waste, saying: ‘The products withdrawn from stores will be sent to anaerobic digestion plants. ‘This is the most efficient method of generating energy from waste, and part of our broader ‘zero food waste to landfill’ strategy. We are the UK’s largest retail user of anaerobic digestion.’ As . a result, families may never know the full extent of the contamination . of burgers and other beef ready meals using suspect ingredients. Tesco . and Iceland have been selling burgers in the UK that came from batches . found to be contaminated with horse meat in tests by the Food Safety . Authority of Ireland. Supermarket . giant Tesco has placed full-page adverts in a number of national . newspapers apologising to customers for selling beefburgers containing . horsemeat. Aldi, Lidl . and Iceland have also withdrawn frozen beefburgers from their shelves . after they were found to be contaminated with horsemeat. Although . manufacturers Silvercrest and Dalepak also made cheap frozen burgers . for other retailers such as Asda, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op, Britain’s . FSA said yesterday morning that it had no intention of testing the . burgers of these other stores, which were on shelves until they were . withdrawn earlier this week. Even . so, Sainsbury's, Asda and the Co-op have withdrawn some frozen products . but stressed that the move was 'purely precautionary' and they had not . been found to be selling contaminated food. FSA officials said there was no food safety risk and, therefore, no reason to test. Later, . however, it said: ‘If the FSA investigations being undertaken at the . moment reveal that we need to look at additional food products then we . will not hesitate to take action which may include further testing.’ Meanwhile, farming leaders called today for immediate action by UK supermarkets to improve their sourcing and labelling of food in the wake of the horse meat burger scandal. National Farmers Union president Peter Kendall said the integrity of UK-produced meat was being compromised by the use of cheaper imports which did not meet the same stringent monitoring systems. He said retailers must take immediate action to address the integrity of their suppliers and ensure that UK products are easily distinguishable and clearly labelled, so customers can make a conscious decision on the food they buy. Mr Kendall added: 'The events of the past few days have severely undermined confidence in the UK food industry and farmers are rightly angry that the integrity of stringent UK-farmed products is being compromised by using cheaper imported alternatives which, evidence suggests, do not meet the robust traceability systems we have in the UK.' He said farmers were also concerned that the high standards and traceability they have to meet are not being upheld throughout the supply chain. 'What is particularly concerning is that this revelation comes at a time when farmers are under enormous pressures and consumer confidence is low. 'Retailers will know they must take immediate action to address both the integrity of all their suppliers, and at the same time ensure that UK products are easily distinguishable and clearly labelled. 'We need to move this debate on to find lasting solutions by putting an end to co-mingled products which mix UK meat with imported meat, as well as clearer labelling of all ingredients in products to ensure consumers can make a conscious buying decision."" He also urged retailers to work more closely with the Red Tractor assurance scheme, which ensures products are British and have met certain standards, increase the scheme's logo on packs and focus on the long-term sustainability of the UK supply chain.

"A killer murdered an antiques dealer and left his body undiscovered for five weeks as he repeatedly returned to loot valuables, a court heard. Graham Richardson allegedly clubbed Peter Battle, 56, to death with a heavy ornament and hid the body at his cottage in Full Sutton, East Yorkshire. He then went back on several occasions, helping himself to antiques and collectables which he sold, it was said. Richardson, 27, allegedly ‘played the generous grandson’ as he gave some of the valuables as gifts to elderly friends and relatives. Victim: Antiques dealer Peter Battle was was found murdered in his countryside home in Full Sutton, East Yorkshire . A court heard he covered up the killing with ‘cunning and guile’ by posting fake notes on Mr Battle’s window and covering his body and a window so it couldn’t be seen. The murder is said to have taken place on December 30 last year and Mr Battle lay undiscovered at his home until early February. His body was eventually found when neighbours started to get concerned and called police, who broke in and found his body. Prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC said Richardson killed Mr Battle in rage when he refused to give him credit on gold to sell. He told Teesside Crown Court that Richardson, of Norton, North Yorkshire, was on bail and desperate for money and went through his ‘little black book’ looking for easy prey. Police believe Mr Battle, 56, may have lain dead in the lounge of his home for weeks before his body was found . On December 29 he went to Mr, Battle’s house hoping to get gold and rings on credit so he could sell them and when that didn’t succeed he returned the following day. Mr Battle again refused and Richardson lost his temper and battered him with a heavy ornament, fracturing his skull, claimed the prosecutor. Scientists allegedly found Richardson’s DNA on Mr Battle’s trouser hem, which the prosecution claims shows he moved the body after death. His DNA was also found on a curtain allegedly used to cover a window and door to prevent people from seeing into the house. The prosecution claims that Mr Battle’s blood was found in Richardson’s mother’s car which he used and tried to scrap after the death. The prosecutor said Richardson was expected to claim that Mr Battle had been killed by another man and he had just ‘chanced on a treasure trove’. He said he was pointing the finger at Darren Archer, 43, who is accused of carrying out a robbery of a gold dealer with Richardson three weeks before the murder. But Mr Lumley asked: 'How could anyone who had nothing to do with the killing keep going back and going back in such close proximity to the body?' Richardson denies murder and possession of Class A drugs, but admits theft of valuables belonging to Mr. Battle and robbery. He is standing trial with alleged robbers Peter Anthony Egan, 48, and Archer, 43, both of York, who both deny robbery. Archer is not charged with murder and the prosecution allege his phone records show he was in York at the time of the killing. Mr Lumley said: 'In the space of three weeks, these three men, driven by the need and greed for money, and sometimes for drugs, were involved in serious crimes culminating in the killing of an innocent man.' The prosecution claims all three robbed gold dealer Michael Cleaver of £4,100 in cash after Richardson lured him to York with false claims he had gold to sell. They say Mr Cleaver was ambushed and threatened with an axe. The trial continues.

"It is 20 years since their last album, but it appears Pink Floyd can still show their younger rivals a thing or two. For the veteran rock band’s new release has become the most pre-ordered album ever on the Amazon website. The Endless River has already beaten boyband One Direction’s 2013 album Midnight Memories, although Amazon refused to say how many orders it has for commercial reasons. Rock stars: Left to right, Dave Gilmour, Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Rick Wright (died September 2008) of Pink Floyd, when they performed at the Live8 concert in Hyde Park in London . Other albums in the top all-time Amazon pre-orders list include Swing Both Ways by Robbie Williams, Progress by Take That and Susan Boyle’s I Dreamed A Dream, as well as two releases by Coldplay, Ghost Stories and X&Y. Pink Floyd achieved worldwide fame with the 1973 album Dark Side Of The Moon but have not released an album since The Division Bell in 1994. Since then, keyboard player Rick Wright has died, as has founder member Syd Barrett, who left the band in 1968 after two albums. The Endless River, their 15th studio album, features singer and guitarist Dave Gilmour, 68, and drummer Nick Mason, 70, but not bassist Roger Waters, 71, who quit the group 30 years ago. Cover: The artwork for the new Pink Floyd album The Endless River, which has topped the charts 20 years on . It is an instrumental double album of 18 tracks and was created as a tribute to Wright, who died from cancer aged 65 in 2008, using unreleased sessions he recorded in 1993 and 1994. 1.

In a recent interview, Gilmour warned that the new Floyd material may not appeal to younger listeners – because the entire album should be listened to in one sitting rather than track by track. He told MOJO magazine: ‘My struggle is to try to not have it over-hyped. All the powers that be that surround us, the record companies and management, want to make a huge, huge, huge fuss and I want to make a bit of a fuss, but I want people to understand where this is coming from and why it’s not Dark Side of The Moon or even The Division Bell. ‘Unapologetically, this is for the generation that wants to put its headphones on, lie in a beanbag, or whatever, and get off on a piece of music for an extended period of time. You could say it’s not for the iTunes, downloading-individual-tracks generation. But there are a lot of people who’ll get a lot of enjoyment out of this.’","The Endless River has already beaten boyband One Direction's 2013 album .

"It's the hilarious new craze for animal lovers - transporting your pet back to a bygone age of grandeur by having it morphed into an Old Master portrait. The results are priceless, and rumour has it the trend has even come to the attention of the Royal Family with an enquiry recently made. Perhaps someone was thinking of a present for the Queen's 88th birthday a couple of weeks ago. Susan Beard helps to turn people's pets into portraits, here she has transformed one of the Queen's corgis into Isabella de Medici . Photographer and designer Susan Beard tapped into a tendency to put our pets on pedestals when she created her company The Regal Beagle - and now cats, dogs and even parrots can become emperors, dukes, statesmen, kings and queens. Look through the gallery online and you'll see a menagerie of pets posing with the utmost seriousness in velvet, ermine and lace, with crowns on their heads and sceptres in their paws. They sit on thrones or pose at writing desks. They paint, they sew. Two pug dog sisters hold paws as Jacobean ladies. A parrot is Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring. 'We look at the pictures and can't stop laughing,' says Susan. But there's something particularly hysterical about recreating the Royal Family's dogs as Renaissance nobility. It's reigning cats and dogs: One dog's take on Henry II, and Grey the cat as Napolian by Ingres . So, for Weekend readers, The Regal Beagle has transported Lupo, William and Kate's black spaniel, back to the Spanish court of the 16th century, where he poses as Prince Don Carlos, son of Philip II of Spain - a proud prince with blue blood heritage, just like his not-so-old master. Poor Prince Don Carlos became wild and unpredictable after suffering a head injury falling down stairs, and once forced a shoemaker to eat shoes he found unsatisfactory. Lupo probably likes to chew a good royal shoe too. Camilla's Jack Russells Beth and Bluebell have been turned into a pair of 16th-century Italian noble children, adapted from a painting by Sofonisba Anguissola of her younger sisters, while either of the Queen's corgis Willow and Holly could become Isabella de Medici, the tragic distant cousin of Catherine de Medici who was appointed Regent of France after her husband Henry II died. Aristocats: Cow and Chewy as French bluebloods . Three of Catherine's sons became King of France, and as well as being credited with inventing the corset she was in charge of France's 16th-century spies - a fitting relative for the dogs who met James Bond Daniel Craig when their mistress was filmed for the Olympics Opening Ceremony in 2012. 'Her Majesty has so many portraits of her ancestors on her walls,' says Susan, 'what could be better than having her beloved corgis posing regally alongside them? After all, pets are family.' What gave Susan, 52, the idea to start The Regal Beagle? 'Two reasons,' she says. 'I absolutely love animals, and in a short space of time I lost my Russian blue cat called Grey of 18-and-a-half years and my sister Sharon, who died of cancer. I was devastated. Two pooches pose as Grant Wood's American Gothic . A parrot poses as Vermeer's Girl with the Pearl Earring, and Milo the mongrel as a 17th century gentleman . 'Grey was my baby. I always saw him as Napoleon. He was a little thing but very commanding with lots of cattitude. Somehow having him as Napoleon on my wall for always made everything better. There was so much sadness but I turned it into something fun, creative and playful.' She thinks cats work particularly well as ancient royals, and shows me a hilarious portrait of a ginger cat as Queen Elizabeth I. 'I've grown up with cats,' she says. 'I've had them all my life, and perhaps cats are funnier than dogs.' Erika Letitia, 30, the artist who works on the pet portraits, adds, 'Dogs tend to have bigger personalities that are easier to see. Cats are often more distant, so seeing them like this is just so funny.' She diverts me to one of her favourite commissions, two London tabby moggies called Chewy and Cow posing as 18th-century French aristocrats Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun and Louis Charles de Bourbon, Count of Eu. 'See, they make you crack up.' What Kate and Will's dog Lupo might look like as a 16th century Spanish Prince . A dog named Belle (after the Disney Princess) poses as Alexandra Princess of Wales and What Camilla's Jack Russells Beth and Bluebell might look like as 16th century sisters . Erika has turned her own mongrel, a rescue dog called Milo, into a gentleman from the 17th century in a scarlet and chestnut frock coat and fancy white shirt and cravat. He's transformed instantly from scruffy dog to hound of importance. 'Now I look at pets and I see them as Old Masters. For instance when the picture of a parrot came in I could only see Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring. I encourage people to send as many photos as they can so I can work on the best one. The more options the better, so I get a better idea of the pet's personality. 'One client wrote back-stories about what each of his cats did in this other royal life. They had museum-style plaques made depicting a fictional history for the cats in the pictures as long-distant relatives of their current cats. Hilarious and sweet. If people want two pets in one painting we find an Old Master with two figures. Sometimes a family. We want to be challenged.' Most people supply their own photos - it helps if there are several with the face at many angles and shots of paws so that Erika can get the most authentic match to the original painting. Anyone can contact The Regal Beagle online and they'll advise you on how to capture a variety of angles to show your pet at its best - they recommend straight on and at eye level, not from above or below. The costs vary according to the size and the type of frame you choose, ranging from a small stretched canvas (5x5in) from around £100 to a large framed canvas (11x14in) at just over £200, plus shipping. Not a princely sum to pay for a unique ancestral pawtrait. http://regalbeagle.net .","Regal Beagle transforms pets into portraits fit for the Queen .

"A Russian scientist believes a remote Siberian rock formation may be the first place that humanity began to follow the movements of the heavens. Sunduki, known as the Siberian Stonehenge, is a series of eight sandstone outcrops on a remote flood plain on the bank of the Bely Iyus river in the republic of Khakassia. Professor Vitaly Larichev, of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography at the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, claims that the 16,000-year-old site was not only a place of huge religious significance in the ancient world, but also its stargazing capital. Dawn of astronomy: A Russian academic says the 'Siberian Stonehenge' could be man's first attempt to monitor the heavens . Starscape: Sunduki is a series of eight box-shaped stones on the landscape of remote Siberia . Each of the eight peaks are have . stones like giant boxes or chests perched on top. The word 'Sunduk' in . Russian means 'chest' or 'trunk' which explains how the place got its modern name. 'For . many years I tried to unravel these mystery 'chests', said Professor . Larichev, who became an 'astro-archeologist' in his bid to unravel the . site's mysteries. 'We don't dig in the ground - we study what ancient people knew about astronomy', he said. 'What . I discovered was a surprise even to myself. Comparing maps accumulated . over many years of astronomical observations, I came to understand that . here in Sunduki, we can see the oldest astronomical observatory, certainly in Asia. By using a central point of reference, our ancestors  could have used the landscape to mark the passage of the sun and moon . Time's arrow: Humans left archaeological evidence that they inhabited the region more than 16,000 years ago . The ancient stargazers could have used giant rocks and chinks in the stone architecture for their calculations . As well as the movement of the heavenly bodies, the mountains could have been used to align north and south . Historical treasure: Archaeologists may uncover more exciting information from the site . 'Its age is about 16,000 years old. The ancient inhabitants of this valley daily observed the sunset, the sunrise and the moon'. Yet the professor thinks these ancient Siberian astronomers, without any instruments, used giant rocks and chinks in the stone architecture in the landscape for their calculations and observations. He claims to have found 'numerous ancient solar and lunar observatories around Sunduki'. Speaking to the Siberian Times, he said: 'This square pattern of stones on the ground shows you the place. 'I knew there would be an orientation point, but we had to search through the grass for a long time to find it. 'Now look up to the top of that ridge. You see a place where there is a crack between the rocks? 'If you were here on the summer solstice, you would see the sun rise right there. Or you would if you were here 2,000 years so. Now the timing is slightly different'. High on one cliff wall is a rock engraving showing dragon heads pointing in one direction, and snake heads the other, something ancient people would have used to tell the time by using the sun. Professor Larichev added: 'In the morning the shadow moves along the snake's body from his head to his tail, and in the afternoon it comes from the other direction along the dragon. 'From the same observation point you can determine true north and south by sighting along the mountains.' There is also rock art at the site and a mysterious white horse symbol found not far from the first 'chest' may have appeared 16,000 years ago, during the Ice Age. But the site has not yielded all its mysteries. There are also burial mounds and other man-made constructions - including irrigation channels - which have yet to be fully explored by archaeologists. Remnant: This horse drawing is believed to be 16,000 years old . Professor Larichev believes Sunduki is the oldest astronomical observatory certainly in Asia and perhaps the world . Ancient observatories were far more than just ways of measuring time and following the paths of heavenly bodies. Anthropologists claim the sites would have combined many aspects of what the ancients believed and how they saw the world.As well as observatories, they may have been used as tombs, temples and even homes. Here are some of the most famous. The Torreón, Machu Picchu, PeruThe tower in this Incan city - built around 1460 - has a stone that is lit up as the sun shines through one window on the June solstice. Around the same time, this window also frames Pleiades star cluster, which was used by the Incas to decide when to plant potatoes. Gaocheng, ChinaThe country's oldest surviving observatory was built in Henan Province around 1276 by renowned Chinese astronomer and engineer Guo Shoujing. It was used for time-keeping and mapping the stars. Astronomers there calculated the length of the year to within 26 seconds - three centuries before Europeans managed it. Big Horn Medicine Wheel, Wyoming, U.S. A Cheyenne monument believed to be 2,000 years old. The line between the central stone and one peripheral cairn points to sunrise on the summer solstice and three cairns line up with the dawn rise of the stars Sirius, Aldebaran and Rigel.Stonehenge, BritainStarted in around 3100 BC, the monument was first used as a burial site. On the June solstice at dawn, the sun rises over a 'heelstone', as viewed from the middle of the monument.

"Fall: Sir Derek Jacobi had to be rushed to hospital by speedboat after plunging down steps at one of the world's most luxurious island resorts . Sir Derek Jacobi had to be rushed to hospital by speedboat after plunging down steps at one of the world’s most luxurious island resorts. The leading Shakespearean actor and star of I, Claudius was unable to walk after the freak accident at the  £1,000-a-night hotel in  the Maldives. He was left in agony when the quadriceps tendons in both his legs ruptured in the fall. Sir Derek had emergency treatment in the islands’ capital, Male, before being flown home to London for surgery. Fans of Sir Derek, 75, have been kept in the dark since the horrifying accident six weeks ago. But his civil partner, Richard Clifford, revealed last night the actor – star of BBC drama Last Tango In Halifax – spent more than  a month in hospital. He is now attending a rehabilitation unit where therapists are working to get him back on his feet, and can walk with the help of sticks. Sir Derek was staying with producer Mr Clifford at the Huvafen Fushi resort when he slipped while descending the flight of stairs in the grounds on his way to lunch. With no hospital on the island, he had to be taken to Male as quickly as possible, so a speedboat was commandeered for the 45-minute trip with Sir Derek lying on a stretcher. Two days later he was flown home for surgery at London’s King Edward VII Hospital. When the quadriceps tendon in the thigh tears, the muscle is no longer anchored to the kneecap. Without that connection, the knee cannot be straightened and an operation is required to reattach the tendon. Luxury: The Huvafen Fushi resort in the Maldives where Sir Derek fell and injured both his legs leaving him unable to walk . Mr Clifford, Jacobi’s partner for 35 years, said: ‘At first he was unable to bend his knees but now he can  flex them about 30 degrees. ‘He has left hospital but will be in rehab for another six weeks. He is frustrated but  in good spirits and looking forward to working on the next series of Last Tango. ‘He needs sticks to get around but the doctors say he will make a full recovery.’ Star: Sir Derek, pictured with Vicious co-star Ian McKellen, slipped while descending the flight of stairs in the grounds on his way to lunch .","Shakespearean actor ruptured the quadriceps tendons in his legs .

"Steve Jobs' ancestral home of Syria has banned the iPhone as the under-pressure government looks to crackdown on pro-democracy activists. Syrian president Bashar Assad is attempting to crush an eight-month-old revolt against his autocratic rule which has led to violent protests across the country and thousands of deaths. It has now been reported that the government has outlawed the iPhone - which was created by Jobs as CEO of Apple - in a bid to prevent activists from using the popular device to post footage of violent protests on the internet. Crackdown: The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs holding up an Apple iPhone. The device has now been banned in Syria . The ban would no doubt anger Jobs' biological father Abdulfattah John Jandali who is a native Syrian and recently came out in support of protesters in a YouTube video. According to Times Live, the Lebanese website Al Nashara, said the ban had been issued by the Customs Department of the Syrian Finance Ministry. Wants change: Steve Jobs' biological father Abdulfattah John Jandali has now voiced his support for the Syrian pro-democracy activists . A statement by the department read: 'The authorities warn anyone against using the iPhone in Syria.' One Syrian activist, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the newspaper: 'It is enough for any tourist or guest visiting Syria to own an iPhone to be a spy suspect. 'Steve Jobs must be turning in his grave on learning that his iconic device is banned in his home country.' The U.N.'s top human rights official warned on Thursday that Syria has entered a state of civil war with more than 4,000 people dead and an increasing number of soldiers defecting from the army to take up arms against the president. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, said the death toll for the revolt stands 'at 4,000 but really the information coming to us is that it's much more than that.' Almost all foreign media has been banned from Syria since the protests began in March. The Syrian government shut down the internet and 3G mobile networks in June in a bid to prevent protesters from communicating. Jobs' biological father Mr Jandali, who did not have a relationship with his famous son, recently expressed his support for the pro-democracy protesters in a YouTube video. Under-pressure: Syrian President Bashar Assad is attempting to crush an eight-month-old revolt against his autocratic rule . He said: 'I am in solidarity with the Syrian people. 'I reject the brutality and killing that the Syrian authorities are committing against the innocent people in Syria. 'And because silence is participation in this crime, I declare my participation in the Syrian sit-in on YouTube.' Mr Jandali is a Syrian immigrant to the U.S. and now works as vice president of a casino in Reno, Nevada. Demonstrators wave green, white and black flags . during a protest march against president al-Assad in Khalidieh, near . Homs, earlier this week . He only learned that Jobs was his son in 2005 - one year after the technology icon was first diagnosed with cancer. Before his son's death in October, he told how he had emailed Jobs a few times but had not called for fear he would wrongly think he was after his money. 'This might sound strange, though, but I am not prepared, even if either of us was on our deathbeds, to pick up the phone to call him,' Mr Jandali said. 'Steve will have to do that, as the Syrian pride in me does not want him ever to think I am after his fortune. 'Now I just live in hope that, before it is too late, he will reach out to me, because even to have just one coffee with him just once would make me a very happy man'. It was 56 years ago that Mr Jandali's girlfriend Joanne Simpson fell pregnant and he was forbidden from marrying her.

The University Clinic Eppendorf in Hamburg, a specialist centre for contagious diseases, gave the man intensive treatment for five weeks after he became infected while working for the World Health Organisation in Sierra Leone in August. The treatment worked and the patient was declared Ebola-free and released earlier this month. An Ebola patient from Senegal,vomited on x-ray machine and a scanner at Eppendorf University Hospital in Hamburg, Germany, during his treatment there . But during his stay the man, a Senagalese scientist, first vomited on a mobile x-ray machine and then on an equally expensive ultrasound scanner, said the clinic's medical director, Christian Gerloff. Both machines now needed to be written off, he said. The standard cost of five weeks of treatment at the clinic is around £250,000 - a cost the will be borne by the WHO. But the clinic would have to meet the costs of replacing the new machines, which was around £1m, Dr Gerloff said. 'The costs involved are extreme, it is difficult to even put a figure on,' he said. 'Only the costs of treatment will be picked up by the World Health Organisation for who the doctor was working, but not the damage which will have to be covered by insurance,' he said. The expensive machines now need to be replaced at a cost of around £1million, said hospital medical director Christian Gerloff (stock image)","Patient was infected while treating Ebola victims in Sierra Leone .

"Doctors at Bellevue Hospital are so busy caring for Ebola patient Dr Craig Spencer that they have begun transferring patients out of the intensive care unit to nearby NYU Langone Medical Center. Bellevue, one of the the most respected hospitals in the nation, is treating its first ever case of Ebola after Dr Craig Spencer arrived at the hospital last week with symptoms of the disease. Until Monday night, doctors were also concerned that Bronx boy who has recently been to Africa also had Ebola. He was isolated and treated with the same level of protection as if the disease was confirmed. Overwhelmed: Bellevue Hospital until Monday night was treating two patients that doctors suspected of having Ebola. One of the patient, a 5-year-old, has since tested negative . NYU Langone medical center is taking four ICU patients from Bellevue so that doctors at the public hospital can focus on Ebola patient Dr Craig Spencer . Ebola tests came back negative and doctors are now saying that he is likely suffering from a respiratory infection. The hospital sent two adult ICU patients to NYU Langone over the weekend and staff are preparing to send two children in the ICU to the hospital, as well, WCBS-TV reports. A spokesman said the transfers are meant to free up staff so that they can concentrate on caring for Dr Spencer, who is listed in serious conditions as he fights the deadly disease. Dr Spencer contracted Ebola while working for Doctors Without Borders in Guinea and did not begin experiencing symptoms until after he had returned home to New York. Public health officials have stressed that Bellevue, America's oldest public hospital, is fully equipped to handle Ebola cases. Dr Craig Spencer contracted Ebola while working for Doctors Without Borders in Guinea . The hospital has 1,200 beds and boasts 1,800 doctors and a staff of 5,500 workers. Dr Spencer is the first American who is not being treated at one of three hospitals with special infectious disease isolation units. Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in America, was treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and later died. The two nurses he infected were transferred to specialized hospitals for treatment and both have since recovered. Seven Americans have been treated for Ebola so far and all have now recovered from the disease. Five were treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Two were treated at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Lincoln and nurse Nina Pham was treated at National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.","Four intensive care patients are being transferred from Bellevue to NYU Langone Medical Center .

"Health officials in Ohio are monitoring more than 100 people following the visit by a Dallas nurse who tested positive for Ebola shortly after returning to Texas from the Cleveland area. Officials stressed Saturday that none of those being monitored are sick. State officials had announced on Friday that 16 people Amber Vinson had contact with were being monitored. Officials say the sharp increase is a result of the identification of airline passengers who flew with Vinson between Dallas and Cleveland and the identification of people who also visited the dress shop where her bridesmaids were trying on dresses. Vinson's stepfather remains quarantined in his home in the Akron suburb of Tallmadge - where Vinson stayed during her trip - and is the only person in the state under such restrictions. Scroll down for video . Amber Vinson, 29, is feared to have been exhibiting Ebola symptoms as early as Friday October 10 before she took her flight out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport to Cleveland, Ohio, and then back. Over 100 people in Ohio are now under observation for the virus . The Frontier Airlines plane that Amber Vinson flew from Cleveland to Dallas on Monday, flies out of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on Wednesday. It emerged today that Miss Vinson may have been showing symptoms on her inbound flight to Cleveland . Police have taped off a home in Tallmadge, Ohio which belongs to the mother of Ebola patient Amber Vinson . Getting serious: The new Texas Department of State Health Services document that healthcare workers with possible exposure to Ebola are being asked to sign in the wake of the Amber Vinson containment issue . This Friday, October 17, 2014, in Dallas, photographs shows an excerpt from a Texas Department of State Health Services document that healthcare workers with possible exposure to Ebola are being asked to sign . Official: The document is signed by David L. Lakey, M.D., Commissioner, TDSHS . Passengers aboard two flights that Ms Vinson took have been told to monitor themselves for signs of the deadly virus for 21 days over fears that Ms Vinson was contagious both when she flew from Dallas to Cleveland on October 10 and when she returned to Texas on Monday. The plane that Ms Vinson was in made five flights loaded with passengers before the CDC notified Frontier that she may have been contagious. The airline is now trying to contact its passengers who flew on plane number N220FR, an Airbus A320, before it was removed from service. The plane made flights to Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and back to Cleveland. WKYC-TV reports that more than 800 passengers are affected by the notice. Passengers who were on the October 10 Frontier Flight 1142 from Dallas/Fort Worth to Cleveland and passengers on Monday's Flight 1143 from Cleveland to Dallas/Fort Worth have been asked to call the CDC and monitor themselves for symptoms. The passengers on the other flight are not thought to be at risk for the disease, but Frontier is notifying them anyway. Those flights are: . Coming Attractions bridal store in Cleveland Ohio. The store voluntarily shut after Miss Vinson went to the store with five of her friends . A view of some of the offerings inside Coming Attractions, where Miss Vinson went bridesmaid shopping last weekend . Despite the widening crisis, health officials have stressed that the risk to everyone - the passengers aboard Ms Vinson's plane, the people she came in contact with in Ohio and especially those who flew on her plane on later flights - is minimal. Officials also stressed that none of the people being monitored have contracted the virus. CDC Dr Chris Braden revealed during a press briefing on Thursday: 'We had started to look at the possibility that she had symptoms going back as far as Saturday. 'This has to do with the bridal shop. Some more information that has come through recently says we can't rule out that she might have had the start of her symptoms on Friday.' Seven people in Cleveland and Akron have put themselves in voluntary quarantine after coming into contact with Miss Vinson, including five friends whom she shopped with for bridesmaid dresses at bridal store, Coming Attractions, in Cleveland. The news has prompted high schools and medical centers in Ohio to send home staff and students amid fears that they could have come into contact with the nurse. Miss Vinson remained in her home for the three days she was in Cleveland, except for one trip to a bridal store with  friends - but authorities are pressing her further on her movements. The store's owners have voluntarily closed while CDC officials investigate the level of risk. The owner of the store told Newsnet5 that Miss Vinson didn't seem sick  when she visited to pick out dresses. The 29-year-old is now being treated at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia where she was described as being in a stable condition.

Miss Vinson was taken by chartered plane from Dallas to Atlanta Wednesday night, where she is currently being treated at Emory University Hospital . She was airlifted from Dallas, Texas on Wednesday evening on a specialized plane with quarantine unit, along with medical staff in hazmat suits. Miss Vinson was one of the nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to treat Duncan when he was admitted a second time on September 28, in the first 'high-risk' days when there is a high volume of bodily fluids from projectile vomiting, bleeding and explosive diarrhea. According to CDC guidelines, the nurse should have limited her movements. It is not clear if Miss Vinson called the CDC before boarding her flight from Dallas to Cleveland. One and two: Miss Vinson contracted the disease after treating America's Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan (left). The 29-year-old bride-to-be was the second nurse who treated Duncan to come down with the virus. The first nurse diagnosed was 26-year-old Nina Pham (right) who was in 'good condition' at Texas Presbyterian Hospital on Thursday . Damage control: Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital is currently monitoring more than 75 health care workers who came into contact with Duncan during his stay. On Wednesday, the hospital announced it would be offering free rooms to these staff members, who may not want to risk infecting their family members . Before her return flight on Monday, the nurse noticed a spike in her temperature and called the CDC several times to see if she should get on the plane. When she finally got through to a CDC representative, she was cleared since her 99.5F fever was beneath the 100.4 threshold. CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden admits that was the wrong call. Dr Frieden also noted that Miss Vinson had flown to Ohio before the first nurse with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham from Fort Worth, was diagnosed with the virus. Miss Pham was described as being in a 'good condition' today. She is being transferred to a special isolation ward at the National Institutes of Health Hospital in Maryland.","Health officials in Ohio are now monitoring at least 100 people who had contact with Amber Vinson last weekend .

"The women’s staff room at Hastings Ebola Treatment Center in Western Rural Area, Sierra Leone, is cramped, stuffy and hot from the sunlight flooding through the window. Nurses in blue scrubs squeeze onto the rickety beds and try to sleep during their break in the Green Zone. Later, they will go to the Yellow Zone, pull on their Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and go back to the wards - the Red Zone. Scroll down for video . Difficult: For nurses such as Alieu Kamara, treating ebola patients has led to them being shunned by locals . For many of these health workers, the hospital is the only place where they are not shunned by the community or their families. And for most, it is passion and not money that drives them on. 'We rent houses and when [the landlords] know we’re working here, they give us notice,' says nurse Joya Koroma, 32. 'When we go to our families, they drive us out of their houses. Even our relatives are afraid of us. We are doing it because we are trained to. We have to serve humanity.' Ms Koroma and the rest of the staff haven't been paid in two weeks. The clinic, which has 100 beds, and is treating patients - including several children - ill with Ebola, is 100 per cent government funded, with no aid agency money or funds. As a result, Ms Koroma and her colleagues are eating far less than they need and are almost always exhausted but have nowhere safe to sleep. Others like male nurse Alieu Kamara, 19, sleep overnight in the men’s staff room - just steps away from the patients they treat. Cramped: The women's staff room at Hastings Ebola Treatment Centre is steps away from the wards . Grim: Many of the wards used to treat the patients are makeshift and converted from other uses . 'My family kicked me out, so this is why I stay here,' says Mr Kamara. 'This is where I can sleep. Most of us here, our families have abandoned us because of the good work we are doing. 'We are here to push the virus out of the country, you understand?' Despite the intensifying crisis, health workers in Sierra Leone, one of the countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic, have been hamstrung by a lack of resources and scant equipment - including protective clothing. Unsurprisingly, badly needed doctors and nurses make up a significant proportion of fatalities, with an estimated 57 per cent of medics working with Ebola patients eventually succumbing to the disease, according to the World Health Organisation. In total, say the most recent reports, 377 health workers across West Africa have succumbed to the virus, with 216 now dead. At Hastings, the sophisticated isolation units of London and Washington seem very far away, and everyone is aware that being on the Ebola frontline brings the greatest risk of all. Frontline: Medics such as Ms Koroma and Mr Karama run a high risk of succumbing to the disease themselves . Battle: Other medics have spoken of their work as a 'war' and a battle that they have to win . Yet despite the risks, Ms Koroma, Mr Karama and their colleagues get no extra help and no extra money for their efforts. 'We are hungry now,' says Ms Koroma. 'There’s no food. Since we started working here, we have no money for pay for anything.' Gandlil Kallon is the District Social Mobilisation Coordinator for the Ministry of Health and Sanitation in Western Rural Area. He says the challenges for health centres and their workers are still emerging, with many more resources needed. 'As we speak now, some of our health staff residing in rented houses within the city are faced with the challenge of being evicted from those places. 'They are being given eviction notices. There are so many challenges that will emerge.' But with attention switching to the spread of the virus - and in particular whether the disease will reach Britain, their plight is being ignored. Dangerous job: British nurse William Pooley was working in a clinic in Sierra Leone when he contracted ebola . Help: British hospital ship RFA Argus, seen here in Falmouth, is on its way to Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown . This, says Tanya Barron, CEO of Plan UK, is a mistake because the only 'truly effective' way to prevent Ebola from reaching Britain is to tackle the crisis in West Africa. 'As the Government introduces more measures to try and prevent the arrival of Ebola in this country, it would be fatal to forget that the best way to help the UK is to help West Africa,' she says. 'This is an outbreak that needs tackling at source, and in order to change the course of the crisis, we mustn't simply hunker down in developed nations. 'Of course it is important for the UK government to protect people here, but the only truly effective way of doing so in the long-term is to bring this crisis under control in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. We must break the chain of infection.' 'The outbreak is affecting the lives of children, parents and their communities in diverse ways,' added Farai Zisengwe, who works for the charity in Sierra Leone. Chaos: For nurses such as Fatumata Koroma, the fight goes on without help from the Government . Dangerous: Nurses are also expected to treat people living in the local area and help them avoid the disease . 'For the health workers working at the front line of the outbreak, it is having a direct effect on them and their families. 'Many of them are being separated from their homes, close family and children, with knock on effects across the community.' At the holding centre in Newton, Western Rural Area, where people suspected of having Ebola are brought before being treated, nurse Fatumata Koroma, 28, supervises the red zone. She says the health workers are terrified of contracting the virus, but are also determined to beat it and save their patients. 'When we started [the staff] were afraid,' says Koroma from the makeshift plastic hut that serves as a staff work room at the centre. 'Now they are getting used to it, but they are still afraid because of our colleagues that have now been infected. 'It’s our war. There’s no way to escape this war, we just have to fight it. It’s a war for us because you can’t touch your close relatives, neither your mother nor your sister. 'But I’m ready to fight this war, I’m ready for it.'","Nurses treating Ebola victims are routinely thrown out of rented homes .

"A nasal spray being developed as a potential vaccine for the deadly Ebola virus has been found to be effective. Scientists at the University of Texas discovered the breathable vaccine offers long-term protection during pre-clinical trials with monkeys. Since the current outbreak erupted in West Africa earlier this year, almost 5,000 people have lost their lives - the majority in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. A number of injectable experimental vaccines are being trialled in the US, UK and Mali, with plans to extend human trials into other parts of Europe, Gabon and Kenya. A nasal spray being developed as a potential vaccine for the Ebola virus (pictured under the microscope) has been found to protect monkeys in pre-clinical trials . There are  vaccination trials ongoing in the US and UK. It is hoped the first results will be available next year . But researchers in Austin, Texas, say their small pre-clinical study is the only proof to date that a single dose of a non-injectable vaccine against Ebola is long-lasting. They claim the discovery could have 'significant global implications in controlling future outbreaks'. A breathable vaccine could overcome the logistical obstacles of storing, transporting and administering injectable vaccines in parts of Africa most afflicted by the virus, the researchers said. The work will be presented tomorrow at the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists Annual Meeting in San Diego. Kristina Jonsson-Schmunk, a graduate in pharmacy and professor Dr Maria Croyle, and Dr Gary Kobinger and his team at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, developed the vaccine over seven years. It was found to improve survival of immunised non-human primates from 67 per cent to 100 per cent, after challenge with 1,000 plaque forming units of Ebola Zaire 150 days after immunisation. It is significant because only 50 per cent of the primates given the vaccine by the standard route - an injection into the muscle - survived challenge. Ms Jonsson-Schmunk said: 'Ebola causes devastating outbreaks with fatality rates of 25 to 90 per cent in Africa and Asia. 'Although progress has been made in understanding the virus' biology, no licensed vaccines or treatments currently exist. 'There is a desperate need for a vaccine that not only prevents the continued transmission from person to person, but also aids in controlling future incidences.' 'The main advantage of our vaccine platform over the others in clinical testing is the long-lasting protection after a single intranasal dose,' Dr Croyle added. Prayers are said for a victim of Ebola  in Freetown, Sierra Leone, as healthcare workers prepare to remove the body from public . Hearth workers cover the body of a man suspected of dying from the Ebola virus on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia.  The World Health Organization said this week that the rate of infection in Liberia appears to be falling but warned that the response effort must be kept up or the trend could be reversed . 'This is important since the longevity of other vaccines for Ebola that are currently being evaluated is not fully understood. 'Moreover, the nasal spray immunisation method is more attractive than a needle vaccine given the costs associated with syringe distribution, needle safety and disposal.' The current Ebola outbreak in Western Africa is the largest and most complex epidemic since the virus was first discovered in 1976, according to the World Health Organisation. With a fatality rate currently as high as 70 per cent, officials have declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The next stage of Dr Croyle and her team's research is a phase one clinical trial that tests the effectiveness of their vaccine in human volunteers. They also plan to further explore their initial data they have collected for the administration of the vaccine as a thin film under the tongue in non-human primates. The study was published in the online edition of the journal Molecular Pharmaceutics. A vaccine to protect millions from the Ebola virus decades after it was first detected does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor African nations. The head of the World Health Organisation's scathing conclusion came as nearly 5,000 people have lost their lives to the hemorrhagic fever - the majority in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO, criticised drugs companies for turning their backs on 'markets that cannot pay'. WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan said: 'Why are clinicians still empty handed, with no vaccines and no cure? Because Ebola has historically been confined to poor African nations' She said the current outbreak - the most deadly in history - has exposed two WHO arguments 'that have fallen on deaf ears for decades'. Addressing the regional committee for Africa in Benin yesterday, Dr Chan said: 'Ebola emerged nearly four decades ago. Why are clinicians still empty handed, with no vaccines and no cure? 'Because Ebola has historically been confined to poor African nations. 'The R&D (research and development) incentive is virtually non-existent. 'A profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay. 'WHO has been trying to make this issue visible for ages. Now people can see it for themselves.'","Scientists at the University of Texas are developing the breathable vaccine .

"The White House has said from the beginning of Ebola Response Coordinator Ron Klain's temporary appointment that it's not his job to be the face of the administration's efforts to stop an Ebola epidemic from breaking out on America's shores. Rather, the president's spokesman has said, Klain's position is a managerial one, and his sole responsibility is 'coordinating the whole-of-government approach.' 'He has performed very well in that task,' press secretary Josh Earnest said today. The fruits of his labor are 'already being felt, at the White House and across the government,' the Obama flak added. But since accepting the job 11 days ago, it's unclear from the outside looking in what it is that Klain has brought to the proverbial table. So far, the government's 'coordination' with Ebola affected states appears to be just as ham-handed as it was before Klain came on, reporters noted at yesterday's press briefing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ebola Response Coordinator Ron Klain listens as President Barack Obama speaks to the media about the government's Ebola response in the Oval Office of the White House last Wednesday.  What Klain gets paid to do is still unclear as there is no evidence he's actually coordinated anything . The federal government's chaotic approach to managing the health crisis has not eroded the public's belief that the government will successfully keep an Ebola outbreak at bay, but a CNN poll released this morning shows that many Americans do not think it is doing a 'good job.' 'It’s a theater of the absurd. It’s laughable,' Dr. Robert Murphy, a professor of medicine and biomedical engineering and director of the Center for Global Health at Northwestern University, told the New York Daily News. Murphy, who the NY Daily News characterized as having 'much experience' in Africa, said the invisibility of Klain plus the nuances of the health care system had created confusion. When the White House tapped Klain to manage the execution of it's Ebola prevention strategy, he was billed as the adult in the room. Having served as two vice presidents' chief of staff, he was lauded by the administration and its allies as having the type of organizational skills necessary to coordinate a government-wide effort. However conservatives immediately began to question Klain's credentials, particularly the fact that he had never handled a health crisis before. Other red flags began to pop up almost immediately. The newly announced Obama adviser accepted the critical position on a Friday but did not officially start work until the following Wednesday for untold reasons. Though he was not technically on the job the first five days after President Barack Obama named him as the administration's Ebola czar, he did visit the White House just hours later. The following day he met with White House chief of staff Dennis McDonough and other administration officials. Yet he skipped an all-hands on deck meeting that Saturday in the Oval Office that was deemed important enough for the president to cancel previously scheduled campaign events that afternoon to attend. The next Monday he was absent from a conference call Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Tom Frieden held with reporters to explain the agency's new 'tiered' risk system for evaluating Ebola threats. And even through he had officially been on the government payroll for two days, he did not appear before a congressional committee last Friday that convened under special circumstances to demand answers from the administration after a second nurse who treated now-deceased Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan came down with the violent virus. It was Frieden who was served up as the administration's sacrificial lamb at the hearing, just as it was Frieden who announced yesterday the government's new guidelines for the voluntary quarantining of health care workers returning from West Africa. And today it was Obama who took the lead in showcasing the government's actions. Before jetting off for an evening campaign event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Obama gave a statement to the press, during which he praised health care workers risking their lives to treat Ebola patients in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Today it was President  Obama who took the lead in showcasing the government's actions to fight Ebola . When again asked by a reporter yesterday what specific areas of the Ebola response are under Klain's authority, as it remains ambiguous, Earnest again said 'his principal responsibility is a behind-the-scenes role in coordinating the whole-of-government response that the President has directed be implemented to respond to this specific situation. 'And that means that he will work closely with the CDC and HHS, other White House officials, to make sure that the Ebola response is up to the high standards that the President has set,' Earnest explained. 'That has in the past included conversations with state and local officials, and I’m confident those kinds of conversations will continue.' Earnest then admitted that Klain has no plans to meet with elected officials in New Jersey or New York to discuss their mandatory 21-day quarantines for medical professionals who come in contact with Ebola carriers. He did however cite New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's decision to let a nurse who tested negative for Ebola twice out of government custody as 'evidence that the ongoing coordination between the Obama administration and state and local officials continues successfully in this case.' What role Klain may have played in her release is unknown, as the Obama flak refused to give out details about which White House officials were in contact with Christie throughout the last several days. But isn't it part of Klain's job to 'streamline the response all across the country?' a reporter asked Earnest. The press secretary didn't answer the question directly, opting to zero in his response on the reporters suggestion that a state-by-state approach to containing and preventing Ebola from spreading could cause 'panic' among Americans who have a limited understanding of the disease. At another point in the briefing he said that because of federalism, states and localities are able to implement their own quarantine policies, regardless of what the CDC or the White House has suggested. What exactly does Ebola czar Ron Klain do? 'His principal responsibility is a behind-the-scenes role in coordinating the whole-of-government response that the President has directed be implemented to respond to this specific situation,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said yesterday . So, 'what has changed since [Klain] started his job?' a reporter asked Earnest . 'Because it appears as though this week there's more confusion than there was last week, given what we're seeing in New York and New Jersey, and more differences between how the states are dealing with it.' 'I think the record should reflect that Mr. Klain started one week ago today last Wednesday,' Earnest told her. 'And in that time we have seen a significant number of announcements related to the whole-of-government approach that the President has ordered to dealing with the Ebola situation.' Admittedly, Earnest said Klain hadn't been involved in all of the administration's policy making given his recent start date, including the requirement that all passengers coming out of West Africa fly through five specific international airports. 'But I do think that what you see here is intensive coordination among a range of federal agencies to respond to this very difficult challenge.' The White House's vague responses had reporters leaving yesterday's hour-long briefing just as confused as they were when it began about what it exactly it is that the government is paying Klain to do. Today Earnest again attempted to talk Klain up, saying he 'has been very hard at work in coordinating the whole-of-government approach that the president has mandated.' 'That means that Ron has arrived here at the White House early in the morning. He's stayed here late at night,' Earnest stated. Klain visited the Health and Human Services Department staff in Washington, D.C. last week, and Earnest confirmed today that he'll travel to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, in the near future to meet with officials there. 'I recognize that all of you have not had the chance to see him and talk to him every day but the president certainly has,' Earnest revealed. Klain is 'somebody with extensive management credentials both inside and outside of government ... who is on task and coordinating this very challenging problem,' the Obama flak added. He later explained that Klain give Obama status updates 'regularly.' Earnest pointed out that he attended a meeting on Sunday with the president, as did other health and national security advisers. 'So I guess he's been here for seven days and he's seen the president on six of them.' This photo, taken Sunday, shows nurse Kaci Hickox in an isolation tent at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, where she was quarantined following her work in West Africa caring for Ebola patients despite testing negative for the virus. Yesterday, she was released after White House administration officials pressured the New Jersey government behind the scenes. It's unclear if Klain was involved in that effort . One federal agency that the White House doesn't appear to have clear coordination with is the Department of Defense. Yesterday, Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Ray Odierno, said all soldiers assigned to West Africa would undergo a mandatory 21-day quarantine. But that will not necessarily be a DOD-wide policy, Earnest told reporters today. DOD has yet to issue a formal policy that will govern quarantine measures, he said. For more information on the military's plans, Earnest directed the press to DOD. The administration's frenzied response to the Ebola crisis had even sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, which is notorious for it's spoofs of the president and other political figureheads, making fun of Klain in its latest episode. At a fake press conference, the show pointed out in its opening skit that Klain had zero experience handling a health crisis before this and suggested that his appointment was a political stunt to help Democrats win the midterm elections. Republicans argued as much in the days immediately following his assignment to the high-profile post. Rep. Tom Price, one of a handful of physicians serving in Congress, claimed Obama made an 'unserious gesture at an incredibly serious moment.' Likewise, House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton of Michigan said in a statement he 'was glad the president got off the campaign trail to finally focus on Ebola.' 'But with this appointment of a czar"" with no health background, he just got right back on,' Upton accused.","It's unclear from the outside looking in what it is that Ebola Response Coordinator Ron Klain has brought to the table since accepting the job .

"An Australian man who recorded an elevated temperature has been told to stay at his home in Thailand after returning from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 49 people have died of Ebola. The unnamed man returned to Thailand on October 17 from the DRC, where he works in the oil-drilling industry. He lives in Trat province, 312km southeast of Bangkok. An Australian man living in Thailand is suspected to have contracted Ebola. He had just returned from the Democratic Republic of Congo . Reports on Sunday said Trat Hospital had been asked by the Thai public health office to prepare 'to put a patient under investigation', after he recorded an elevated temperature when he was tested at Bangkok international airport. A doctor at Trat Hospital's emergency unit said the man had been told to 'remain at home' under observation, until November 5, three weeks after returning from Africa. 'He doesn't come to the hospital, he just stays at home,' the doctor told AAP. The order is in line with the mandatory 21-day quarantine for medics returning to the US who may have had contact with Ebola patients in west Africa. The Ebola outbreak in the DRC, reported by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is unrelated to the outbreak in west Africa, where nearly 10,000 people have been infected and almost 5000 have died from the virus. In DR Congo, the CDC has reported 67 cases of Ebola and 49 deaths. The concerns over the Australian comes as Thai medical authorities are set to reveal the results of blood tests on a British man, 68, who was found dead in his apartment in Phuket on October 23. The man, who had travelled from Lagos in Nigeria on October 7, went to a local hospital on October 15 after fainting. Doctors treated him for a heart condition and sent him home. The Thai Health Department is monitoring about 25 people who had been in contact with the man. Research scientists at Thailand's Mahidol University announced recently they were successful in developing an antibody treatment for Ebola using human gene therapy. The Thai researchers are receiving assistance from the World Health Organisation and the US National Institute of Health to continue their research. Thailand is closely monitoring visitors from Ebola-affected states, with more than 2400 people screened without detecting any cases.","Australian man confined to his Thailand home with a high temperature .

"Public sector workers will not get an above-inflation pay rise for another four years, it emerged today as unions prepare a huge strike over pay and pensions. Conservative minister Matthew Hancock suggested pay restraint would have to continue until the government has ‘the books balanced’ in 2018. Up to 1million teachers, council workers, health workers, firefighters and civil servants will walkout across England and Wales on Thursday. Conservative minister Matt Hancock suggested pay restraint would have to continue until the nation's books are balanced in 2018 . This week’s industrial action is expected to be the biggest over pay since the coalition came to power, with plans for further action later in the year. Unions argue that frontline staff have paid the price for austerity, and salaries have been frozen or risen slower than inflation. Despite years of pay restraint, staff in the public sector still April earned between 2.2 per cent and 3.1 per cent more than the private sector in the year to April 2013, the ONS says. The average pay difference in favour of the public sector has narrowed since the year 2010, which in part reflects the restraints on public sector pay over this period, the ONS says. CPI inflation dipped to 1.5 per cent in the year to May, having peaked at 5.2 per cent in September 2011. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'People can’t keep going on having cuts in their living standards' Up to 1million public sector workers are expected to take part in strike action on Thursday . Chancellor George Osborne has frozen pay for many public sector workers, or offered 1 per cent rises, while inflation has been at . Mr Hancock, a skills minister, told BBC On'es Sunday politics inflation would continue to outstrip wages for taxpayer-funded jobs for another four years. Asked if public sector workers would ever get a real increase in their pay under a Conservative government, Mr Hancock replied: ‘Well, we certainly hope to have the books balanced by 2018. He added: ‘I don’t think it is the right time to let go of the public finances at all. ‘We were always clear that this is what’s called a structural deficit; it doesn’t go away just because growth is returning and the economy’s coming back. ‘We have protected and are protecting the lowest-paid public sector workers who weren’t part of the pay freeze, now pay going up by 1 per cent. At almost every age, public sector workers earn more per hour than someone of the same age in the private sector, according to the Office for National Statistics . Unions have been branded 'irresponsible' for staging walkouts based on ballots in which few members took part, or were staged up to two years ago. Prime Minister David Cameron pledged earlier this year that he would back tougher laws, including a higher threshold of those voting to take industrial action before a strike could go ahead. Business leaders have been pressing for a new law setting a target of at least 50 per cent of those balloted having to vote in favour, an idea supported by the PM and other leading Conservatives. London Mayor Boris Johnson has spoken of changes in balloting laws during previous strikes by Tube workers in the capital. Today Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said: 'We are not relaxed about them [the strikes], but the point to make first is most public sector workers regard their duty to serve the public as being paramount, so most public service workers won't be going on strike on Thursday. It will be a minority and we don't know how many it will be. 'These strikes are based on ballots which are either with extremely low turnouts or, in some cases, with no recent ballot at all,' he told Sky News. 'The only teachers' union calling a strike, the NUT, is relying on a mandate in a ballot that was called nearly two years ago. 'Taking action, which if it is effective is going to damage the interests of children and a load of hard-working parents who just want to be able to go to work that day... it is really very irresponsible.' ‘Of course these are difficult decisions – we’ve had that discussion many times – but they’re absolutely necessary to in order to keep that plan on track and, as we can see with the wider economy, it’s working.’ Mr Hancock insisted this was not just about the Conservatives and the Lib Dems and challenged Labour to condemn this week’s strike. ‘The Labour Party leadership has said it’s a test to their credibility that they support a squeeze on public sector pay. ‘In fact I look forward to them – they ought to come out and say very clearly that these strikes are wrong and that they’re against the strikes and stop taking union money.’ But earlier Labour’s shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt refused to condemn the walkouts three times. He told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show: ‘It’s not up to me to tell trade unionists what to do – what I want is teachers in classrooms in a conversation with the Secretary of State so we get over these kind of hurdles. ‘We didn’t have these kind of strikes under a Labour government. I want all teachers in the schools teaching the young people, but we have independent trade unions in this country and that is an important part of civil society.’ TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady also criticised the Government for refusing to increase pay for the public sector. She said: ‘What firefighters, local government workers and health worker who are protesting too alongside teachers are saying is that this Government is not listening, it’s out of touch, people can’t keep going on having cuts in their living standards, depending on benefits. ‘What really sticks in the throat is the idea that money can be found to give tax cuts to billionaires, to millionaires and to big corporations, but it can’t be found to help, for example, the 500,000 workers in local government – dinner ladies, school meals workers, lollipop men and women – who are earning less than the minimum wage.’ Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: 'Reports that the Tories are planning to ban public sector strikes and ratchet up their anti-union laws are nothing new and will meet the fiercest possible resistance. 'The front line of defence against cuts and austerity is the organised working class and that is why the Tories and big business want to tighten the legal noose around our necks. They will have a fight on their hands.'","Tory minister Matt Hancock warns of four more years of pay restraint .

"When you look at your sleek, shiny phone it may look clean - excepting perhaps a few scuffs and smears from normal wear and tear. But look below the surface and you will find an interior that is far more toxic than most people realise. Researchers have undertaken a chemical analysis of 36 mobile handsets - including the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III - to find out which ones pose the most risk to the health of humans and our environment. Researchers from healthystuff.org and ifixit analysed the chemicals inside leading phones, giving them a chemical ranking for how environmentally friendly they are. The researchers analysed 30 different handsets for the research, including the bestselling Samsung Galaxy S3 . Ubiquitous electronic gadgets harbour a . staggering array of toxic chemicals, from hazardous flame retardants, . PVC and bromine to heavy metals like lead, tin and chromium - and even . mercury and cadmium. However the hazardous ingredients of . mobile phones have long been kept under wraps by manufacturers who are . tight lipped about the recipes they use for their high-tech components. The only way to find out then, is to . take apart the gadgets and analyse their chemical components - which . experts from ifixit.org and healthystuff.org have now done. HeathyStuff.org sampled 36 different . mobile phones that had been released in the last 5 years. The phones . were completely disassembled and interior and exterior components were . sampled by X-ray Fluorescence spectrometry - a process which determines . the chemical composition of a material. The team found that more modern phones are far more environmentally friendly - although the latest iPhone does have more harmful chemicals than its predecessor. Agbogbloshie is a suburb of Accra, the capital of Ghana and the country's largest city. Above it rises a doomsday column of acrid black smoke - fuelled by burning plastic e-waste. The area is poisonous, post-apocalyptic hell - a sprawling, toxic dumping ground stretching for a mile or two. This is the final resting place for your old TV, computer or mobile phone. Piles of cracked computer monitors sit in rancid pools of noxious green slime, while the circuit boards and innards of old PCs leak toxic mercury, beryllium and cadmium, poisoning the earth. Scampering over these mounds of decaying computers are red-eyed gangs of wild, young boys in rags who smash old computer components with rocks to rip out the valuable copper wire inside. Here they burn the plastic away from computer monitors and plastic encased cables to get to the precious metals inside. The combustion releases toxic metals - lead, beryllium, cadmium, mercury - into the atmosphere. Likewise, burning creates some of the most carcinogenic and toxic substances known, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans . This desperate situation here is part of a pattern all over the globe - First World nations dump their electronic rubbish on developing countries, poisoning communities, polluting water sources and causing birth defects, mental retardation and, ultimately, death. The researchers then ranked the phones . on a scale of 0-5 - with lowest being the best - according to three . criteria: by chemical, by component and overall. The Motorola Citrus ranked the least . toxic phone followed by the iPhone 4 S and the LG Remarq. The new iPhone . 5 ranked 5th - better than its main competitor, Samsung's Galaxy S III, . which ranked 9th. The most toxic phone tested was the . iPhone 2G, which was so poisonous it prompted a report by environmental . group Greenpeace warning of the environmental dangers it posed. Every phone sampled in the study . contained at least one of following hazardous chemicals: lead, bromine, . chlorine, mercury and cadmium. These hazardous substances can pollute . throughout a product’s life cycle, including when the minerals are . extracted; when they are processed; during phone manufacturing; and at . the end of the phone’s useful life. Emissions during disposal and recycling of phones as electronic waste, or 'e-waste', are particularly problematic. A 2004 study found that three-quarters of all cell phones leach lead at levels that would qualify them as hazardous waste. While tracking e-waste is difficult, . it is estimated that 50-80 per cent is exported to countries such as . China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam and the Philippines, where there is a . labour-intensive, informal recycling infrastructure that often lacks . environmental and human health safeguards. Meanwhile, the mining of some tin, . tantalum, tungsten and gold vital for use in the manufacture of mobile . phones has been linked to bloody conflicts in the Democratic Republic of . Congo. Jeff Gearhart, research director at . the Ecology Centre and founder of HealthyStuff.org, said: 'Even the best . phones from our study are still loaded with chemical hazards. 'These chemicals, which are linked to . birth defects, impaired learning and other serious health problems, have . been found in soils at levels 10 to 100 times higher than background . levels at e-waste recycling sites in China. 'We need better federal regulation of . these chemicals, and we need to create incentives for the design of . greener consumer electronics.'","Researchers carry out analysis of 36 mobile phones to determine which contain the most toxic chemicals in their components .

"A new high-tech 'mirror' means shoppers need no longer try clothes on - because it shows the latest garments on a digital scan of your body. The virtual wardrobe will save time by using a motion-capture camera to produce a realistic 3D image of each customer as they stand in front of the 6ft 6in screen. The computer even selects a range of clothing and accessories it believes will suit the shopper's shape and size, and presents them on the display. Scroll down for video . The new high-tech 'mirror' means shoppers need no longer try clothes on - because it shows the latest garments on a digital scan of your body . The device, hailed as 'every woman's dream invention', uses Microsoft's motion sensing technology, Kinect 3D . Shoppers can then use a simple wave of their hand to choose which ones they wish to 'try on', and instantly see what it looks like. The system - available in High Street shops this summer - is so advanced it can show how clothes hang from the shoulders and cling to the body. The device, hailed as 'every woman's dream invention', uses Microsoft's motion sensing technology, Kinect 3D. The technology brings to life the 1995 film Clueless, in which Alicia Silverstone's character Cher used a computer to help her decide what to wear. The virtual wardrobe was unveiled at The Microsoft Apartment in Covent Garden, London, today. It will be used at pop-up stores on the High Street and at airports this summer, and will be available to buy for home use by 2016. Customers can share the images with family and friends through social networking sites to gauge their opinion before buying . Eoghan O'Sullivan, from augmented reality firm Von Bismark, said: 'The interactive mirror shows people how an item of clothing, handbag, or accessory might look on them. 'It works by motion capture, allowing it to immediately identify a woman's size and shape. 'The software then tells the garment how to sit on the body - whether that's how a dress hangs off the shoulders, or how a pair of trousers hang off the hips.' Customers can share the images with family and friends through social networking sites to gauge their opinion before buying. Rahul Sood, from Microsoft, said:'The relationship between design and technology is becoming ever more important when applied to modern fashion startups. For keen fashionista, the mirror will be available to buy for home use by 2016 . The computer even selects a range of clothing and accessories it believes will suit the shopper's shape and size, and presents them on the display . 'This system takes depth data from the moving Kinect camera, in real time, to create highest quality, geometrically accurate 3D models. 'Gesture control and skeletal tracking enables an exciting shopping experience. 'We believe this will come to revolutionise the UK shopping experience on the High Street for women and men.' Office worker Rebecca Hughes, 28, from Brighton, East Sussex, said the new device was 'every woman's dream invention'. She added: 'Going clothes shopping can be an extremely time-consuming and stressful experience. 'It can be a nightmare traipsing from shop to shop, trying to find an outfit that fits and looks stylish at the same time. 'Standing in changing rooms trying on dress after dress for hours on end can be soul-destroying. 'To be able to stand in front of a 'virtual mirror' that chooses clothes for you and immediately shows you how you look in them is fantastic.

"A medic has spoken of the horrific scenes witnessed by emergency doctors and nurses in the fight against the deadly Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Naoufel Dridi, who works with humanitarian charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), described the suffering by patients struck down by the tropical virus, and the difficulties facing aid workers as they attempt to treat those suffering. French Mr Dridi, 41, has been helping coordinate the charity's relief work in the West African country and said that in his 13 years working with MSF he had never had to cope with the number of deaths in such a short space of time. Scroll down for video . Battle: Health specialists work in an isolation ward for patients at the Médecins Sans Frontières facility in Guekedou, southern Guinea . Horror: Naoufel Dridi, who works with MSF has described the suffering by patients struck down by the tropical virus, and the difficulties facing aid workers, such as these medics . The number of suspected cases in Guinea has now reached 122, and at least 80 people are believed to have died. 'You can be helping somebody by getting them a juice, or a glass of cold water, or whatever he wants because you know really he has very little chance to survive, and then less than an hour later he is dead,' Mr Dridi told the Daily Telegraph. 'Then when you are putting his body in the bag, another one behind you has died. Then another one.' Ebola is passed onto humans from animals - . especially fruit bats - and often breaks out near rainforests in . central and western Africa. Outbreak: Medics prepare for work in an isolation ward. The number of suspected cases in Guinea has now reached 122, and 80 people are believed to have died . Precaution: MSF staff have been wearing full protective clothing to help prevent the spread of disease and have made it clear to local medics that there are no drugs to treat the virus . Patients who develop the severe acute viral are often suddenly subjected to fever, muscle pain, headaches and sore throats, followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rashes, impaired kidney and liver function. In some cases sufferers experience both internal and external bleeding, and the highly contagious, and painful illness, can be passed on to humans through contact with the bodies of people killed by the virus. There is no cure for the virus, and no vaccine which can protect against it. The Ebola outbreak is the first of its . kind in West Africa in two decades, and the first ever in Guinea. Symptoms: Patients who develop the severe acute viral are often suddenly subjected to fever, muscle pain, headaches and sore throats, followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rashes, impaired kidney and liver function . Other West African countries, including neighbouring Sierra Leone and . Libera where suspected cases have also been detected - are now . scrambling to bring the outbreak under control, with many of them . imposing health and travel restrictions. Morocco has imposed strict controls to stop the disease spreading into the country, and Saudi Arabia's health ministry has recommended that its government stop issuing visas to Muslim pilgims from Guinea and Liberia from visiting its holy sites. Mr Dridi, who lives in Geneva, Switzerland, said that many local doctors and nurses did not initially know how serious the virus was, as it is the first time Guinea has been affected by it. MSF staff have been wearing full protective clothing to help prevent the spread of disease and have made it clear to local medics that there are no drugs to treat the virus. At work: An MSF nurse examines a patient at a center for victims of the Ebola virus in Guekedou . He said it was difficult for both medics and the families of those affected to move patients into isolation tents to prevent the virus being passed to relatives and staff. 'They know we can only treat the . symptoms, not the virus. Whether that person survives or not is only . down to whether the body reacts well and fights the illness,' said Mr . Drdi, who has now returned to the MSF headquarters in Switzerland. MSF have warned they face an uphill task to battle the virus because the infections are scattered across several locations, most worryingly in Guinea's densely populated capital Conakry. But the World Health Organisation has played down the extent of the outbreak, and said there had previously been much larger numbers of people affected in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. Task: MSF have warned they face an uphill task to battle the virus because the infections are scattered across several locations, most worryingly in Guinea's densely populated capital Conakry . 'This is relatively small still. The biggest outbreaks have been over 400 cases,' WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told a news conference in Geneva. He added it was not the first time Ebola had been reported in a capital city. It struck Gabon's Libreville in the 1990s. 'Ebola already causes enough concern and we need to be very careful about how we characterise something which is up until now an outbreak with sporadic cases,' Hartl said. However, MSF Director General Bruno Jochum said it was remarkable the outbreak had spread to several places and to a city of around two million people, Conakry. 'These two characteristics make it an exceptional event for an Ebola outbreak up until today,' Mr Jochum said, adding that given the high mortality rates among identified cases, it should be taken extremely seriously. Virus: The World Health Organisation played down the extent of the outbreak, and said there had previously been much larger numbers of people affected in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda . Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, also said it was a real worry that the virus had spread from sparsely populated forest zones to Conakry, where population density was close to 10,000 per square kilometre. 'An Ebola outbreak there could lead to a humanitarian disaster,' he said. The outbreak of one of the world's most lethal infectious diseases has alarmed a number of governments with weak health systems, prompting Senegal to close its border with Guinea and other neighbours to restrict travel and cross-border exchanges. Guinea, the hardest hit by the outbreak, had the lowest ratio of hospital beds per capita in a World Bank survey of 68 nations in 2011, with just 0.3 hospital beds per 1,000 people. In Liberia, there were seven suspected or confirmed cases, of whom four have died. Liberia's Senate on Tuesday agreed that the government should declare a state of emergency that would lead to the closure of the country's borders. 'Liberia should close her borders with all the three countries which are sharing borders with us - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast,' said Senator Sando Johnson. Liberia's lower house of parliament is expected to debate the proposal on Thursday. If passed, it will be sent for approval to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.","Naoufel Dridi, 41, works with humanitarian charity Médecins Sans Frontières .

"Prince Charles refused to support Sir Salman Rushdie during his fatwa over The Satanic Verses because he thought the book was offensive to Muslims. In an article for Vanity Fair magazine, Martin Amis claimed that the Prince's views caused a row at a dinner party after Rushdie was issued with the death sentence by Islamic clerics in 1989. Amis claims that Charles told him that he would not offer support ‘if someone insults someone else’s deepest convictions’. Civil conversation: The Prince of Wales talks to Padma Lakshmi, the then-girlfriend of author Sir Salman Rushdie (right) at the British Library in 2001 - 11 years after Rushdie was issued with the death sentence by Islamic clerics . What he really thought: But behind the scenes, Prince Charles refused to support Sir . Salman (right) during his fatwa over The Satanic Verses because he . thought the book was offensive to Muslims . Amis remonstrated with him but all Charles did was ‘take it on board’, even though Rushdie is a British-Indian citizen. Rushdie’s fatwa was issued by Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini over the publication of The Satanic Verses, which supposedly insulted the Prophet Mohammed and The Koran. The fatwa, or ‘spiritual opinion’, followed a wave of book burnings in Britain and rioting across the Muslim world which lead to the deaths of 60 people and hundreds being injured. Rushdie was put under round-the-clock security at the expense of the British taxpayer when a £1.2million bounty was put on his head. Deepest convictions: Martin Amis (pictured with Rushdie in 2010) said Charles told him that he would not offer support 'if someone insults someone else's deepest convictions' Strong stance: The Vanity Fair article says novelist Stephen King (left) refused to let stores in America sell his books if they refused to carry The Satanic Verses. Charles’ lack of support for Rushdie . comes at a time when he is under the spotlight for his supposed . willingness to meddle in the affairs of others . In the Vanity Fair article Rushdie’s friends and literary colleagues such as Ian McEwan tell the inside story of the controversy, but Amis’ comments about Charles are the most frank. Amis says: ‘I had an argument with Prince Charles at a small dinner party. Angry: Rushdie's fatwa was issued by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini over the publication of The Satanic Verses, which supposedly insulted the Prophet Mohammed and The Koran . ‘He said - very typically, it seems to me - ‘I’m sorry, but if someone insults someone else’s deepest convictions, well then,’ blah blah blah… . ‘And I said that a novel doesn’t set out to insult anyone: ‘It sets out to give pleasure to its readers,’ I told him. ‘A novel is an essentially playful undertaking, and this is an exceedingly playful novel.’ ‘The Prince took it on board, but I’d suppose the next night at a different party he would have said the same thing.’ Charles’ lack of support for Rushdie comes at a time when he is under the spotlight for his supposed willingness to meddle in the affairs of others. Some £250,000 of taxpayers’ money has been spent on legal fees trying to stop publication of letters he sent to politicians that will supposedly show he was trying to influence policy, a breach of Royal protocol. The Vanity Fair article says that, in contrast to Charles, novelist Stephen King refused to let stores in America sell his books if they refused to carry The Satanic Verses. He called the head of one US bookstore chain and said: ‘You don’t sell The Satanic Verses, you don’t sell Stephen King. ‘You can’t let intimidation stop books. It’s as basic as that. Books are life itself.’ During the Fatwa Rushdie lived in permanent terror and at one point thought his ex-wife Clarissa Luard and their son Zafar, who was nine at the time, had been killed by assassins or kidnapped. 'Spiritual opinion': The fatwa, or 'spiritual opinion', followed a wave of book burnings in Britain and fierce demonstrations across the Muslim world (such as this in Pakistan) which lead to the deaths of 60 people and hundreds being injured . Round-the-clock guard: Rushdie was put under round-the-clock security at the expense of the British taxpayer when a £1.2million bounty was put on his head . In 1998 Iran’s reformist president relaxed the fatwa and said it had no intention of tracking Rushdie down and killing him. Technically it still stands but is unlikely to be enforced. In recent years Rushdie, 66, has been more known for his relationships than his books. He has has two children from his four marriages - his other son is called Milan - but has been linked with many other women including Indian model Riya Sen.","Author Martin Amis made the revelations in an article in Vanity Fair magazine .

"Fresh from his round of golf with President Obama on Sunday, Tiger Woods chose to be complimentary yesterday when asked about the course skills of the most powerful man in the world. The notorious philanderer and Mr. Obama played out a 'boy's weekend' over the President's Day weekend at the Floridian Yacht and Golf Club and Woods was quizzed at a press conference after a practice round at the WGC-Accenture Matchplay Championship in Arizona. 'He’s got amazing touch,' said Woods. 'He can certainly chip and putt. If he ever spent — after these four years — spent more time playing the game of golf, I’m sure he could get to where he’s a pretty good stick.,' said the world's number two golfer somewhat diplomatically. Mutual appreciation society: President Obama with Tiger Woods at the White House in 2009 - the pair have praised each others golfing abilities . Asked if the president and Woods had squared up against each other over 18-holes, the 14-time major winner revealed that Mr. Obama had been his partner in a foursome against U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and Houston Astros owner Jim Crane. 'He was my partner, and as I said, we won,' said a smiling Woods. 'Playing with Mr. President was pretty cool,' Woods said. 'He’s just a wonderful person to be around. We won.' Quizzed further on the leader of the free world's golfing abilities, Woods praised the president's fitness. 'He’s a pretty good athlete, and we all know he played a lot of hoops,' said Woods. He sounded surprised to learn that Obama played left-handed, and when asked to describe the president's best shot, Woods said that ';he hit a few.'' 'He’s a lefty, but to see him out hitting shots — he hit it well, and we didn’t play under the easiest conditions.' Back in the swing of things: President Obama waves in the doorway of Air Force One as he departs from Palm Beach International Airport on Monday . Back to business: Obama jogs up the stairs of . Air Force One upon his departure from Florida heading for D.C. (left) as . an aide carries on the golf back of Obama's friend Eric Whitaker . Bags of fun: An aide heaves several golf bags up the stairs of Air Force One . Pushed on how he got the invitation, Woods said: 'He calls up and says, 'Hey Tiger you wanna play?' 'Obviously there is a process that's involved, and I was invited to play, and it was an invitation that certainly you don't turn down, especially [since] he's an avid golfer, and so am I. 'So we went out there and we had just a great round of golf with Ron and Jim, and it was a good day.' The traveling pool of journalists who follow the President's every move were reportedly furious after being shut out of his round of golf and not being allowed on to the club grounds on Sunday. It has long been a White House tradition that pool reporters cover the President's rounds of golf and even have the opportunity for a few questions on the course. The President waved as he jogged up the steps of Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport on Monday evening while a White House aide heaved golf clubs and large bags on board. Home again: President Barack Obama waves to members of the media as walks across the South Lawn of the White House following his arrival on Marine One helicopter on Monday night . When he landed back in Washington and walked across the White House lawn, several frustrated reporters collectively shouted to the President to ask if he had beaten Tiger Woods. He did not respond. The outrage over the lack of transparency comes as much of the bill for the pricey trip will be paid for by tax payers, yet President Obama did not feel it appropriate to even release one photo of his time out on the course. The President played with the notorious philanderer on Sunday after getting a private lesson from Woods' former coach the day before. However the only inside reports about the rounds came from a golf journalist who happened to be in the clubhouse at the time. 'Speaking on behalf of the White House Correspondents Association, I can say a broad cross section of our members from print, radio, online and TV have today expressed extreme frustration to me about having absolutely no access to the President of the United States this entire weekend,' Fox News reporter Ed Henry said. On the course: CNN was the only network to air footage of President Obama during one of his golf outings, but it does not appear to be whilet he played with Tiger Woods . Using his lessons: Obama spent three days in Florida over the President's Day weekend . One last round: President Obama (seen in the white cap) played an estimated five or six rounds in three days . 'There is a very simple but important principle we will continue to fight for today and in the days ahead: transparency.' $943,687.50: estimated cost of a trip for Air Force One from Chicago to West Palm Beach and then back to Washington, D.C.$13,500: Cost to rent out three four-bedroom guest cottages at The Floridian for three nights$24,000: Cost of an eight-hour private golf lesson with famed instructor Butch Harmon$1,800: Greens fees for three guests for two rounds of golf$1,600: Cost of four caddies for two rounds of golf$4,620: Cost of 20 rooms at the Port St. Lucie Holiday Inn for traveling press and security detail based on the government day rate . TOTAL: $989,207 . The President's deputy press secretary Josh Earnest responded to the pool's concerns by simply saying that they were previously told about the level of access- or lack thereof- that they should expect from the weekend. ABC News reported that in 2012, it cost $179,750 per flight hour to run Air Force One. Using that rate- even though it is likely higher now since gas prices have risen- the cost of the flights to Florida and back to Washington on Monday totaled $943,687.50. He rented out all three of the four-bedroom guest cottages on the grounds of The Floridian for the whole of the long weekend, as well about 20 hotel rooms from the nearby Holiday Inn- which is about 20 minutes drive from the course- for his traveling entourage of press and security. Expectantly, their price differentials are significant, as one night in a guest cottage costs $1,500 while the Holiday Inn told MailOnline that they charged the government a day rate of $77 per room. On top of the logistical expenses, . the whole point of the trip was to relax on the golf course, which . involves a whole host of expenses in itself. Guest greens fees at The Floridian are $300 per person, and each player hires a caddy who costs $200 per round. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton (L) and U.S. President Barack Obama(R) chat after completing the first hole during a golf game at Joint Base Andrews, MD, September 24, 2011 . For three guests to play two rounds of golf over the weekend, greens fees come to $1,800 and the caddies fees for the foursome total $1,600. Another personal expense that Mr Obama racked up came from the eight hour one-on-one lesson with golf pro Mr Harmon. Since those lessons typically cost $3,000, that means that Mr Obama's bill came to a tidy $24,000 after his intensive session on Saturday. During his stay, the President never left the grounds of the golf club, meaning that his transportation and security costs were kept to a minimum. A spokesman for the nearby police department said that they had not been asked by the Secret Service to provide any additional security. While this is the first time that the President has played golf with Woods- who has won the most titles in the storied sport- it is not the first time that they have met. The disgraced golfer did a reading at one of President Obama's inaugural festivities in 2009 and followed that up with a visit to the White House. In David Maraniss's 2012 biography of President Obama he especially looked at his enduring love affair with basketball. Traveling to Punahou, an elite prep school in Hawaii to discover what his classmates made of his skills, Maraniss discovered that he wasn't that good: . 'If Obama was . unhappy about his playing time, the truth is he had to work exceedingly . hard just to make the team. He made it more because of his intense . passion for the game -- his will -- than anything else. …The reality was . that Barry, as skilled and intelligent a player as he was, could not . stand out in this group. He had good court sense and an ability to slash . to the basket, but was an unreliable outside shooter and not much of a . jumper...'Decades . later, a story emerged that his nickname was Barry O’Bomber, playing . off his last name and a propensity to fire away from long range, but few . team members recalled that nickname… and said the real gunner was Darin . Maurer, who was better than Obama but barely got more playing time…'He . loved basketball so much, I think a lot of things have been blown out . of proportion,” said [former teammate Alan] Lum. … [W]hen it came down . to playing time, he [Barry] wasn’t one of the five best.” In fact, Lum . and other teammates pointed out, Barry was only occasionally considered . one of the top eight…'Obama…was . also among the most earthbound – he could not jump high enough to dunk . the ball. “Barry’s lack of ups was obvious,” recalled [former player . Tom] Topolinski. In fact, [coach Chris] McLachlin coined a phrase for the phenomenon: Barry Obama, famous for his no-jump jump shot!","Obama played at exclusive Florida course on Sunday with Tiger Woods .

"The assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 shocked the world and became a watershed moments in American history. But few people know that his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, narrowly avoided being shot to death just hours after his impromptu inauguration aboard Air Force One. On the night of November 22, 1963, the newly minted 36th president of the United States was in his home in Washington DC, where Secret Service agent Gerald Blaine was assigned to his security detail. Close call: A new book has revealed that Lyndon B. Johnson (right) was nearly killed by a Secret Service agent on the night of President Kennedy's 9left) assassination in 1963 . Mistaken identity: Just hours after Johnson's swearing-in ceremony aboard Air Force One (pictured), the president was in DC when agent Gerald Blaine mistook him for an intruder and pointed a sub-machine gun at his chest . In the confusion that followed President Kennedy's killing and Johnson's haphazard swearing-in ceremony, everyone forgot to tell the president about a new security protocol that had been put in place. When Agent Blaine heard footsteps approaching in Johnson's home from the wrong direction, he grabbed a Thompson sub-machine gun and placed his finger on the trigger. A moment later, the agent found himself pointing his loaded gun directly at the chest of the new commander-in-chief. Blaine later recalled that a split-second later he would have shot Johnson. Johnson's little-known near-death experience at the hands of a Secret Service agent is detailed in the new non-fiction book Hunting the President: Threats, Plots, and Assassination Attempts — from FDR to Obama' by historian Mel Ayton, which was reviewed by the New York Post. Soft targets: Presidents Obama, Bush and Clinton all have been targeted by would-be assassins . President George W. Bush (left) was nearly killed in 2005 while visiting Georgia when Vladimir Arutyunian (right) tossed a live grenade at the podium during his speech . American presidents are among the most closely guarded people in the world, surrounded at all times by well-trained men and women of the U.S. Secret Service, but as Ayton's book shows, that does not stop people from making attempts on their lives. Wanted man: President Reagan was stalked by a man who called himself 'catman,' and who sent letters with photos of cats . Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Johnson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have all been targets of elaborate, and at times outlandish and plain crazy, assassination plots. In 2005, President Bush was delivering a speech in the country of Georgia when a man named Vladimir Arutyunian, 28, hurled a live Soviet-era hand grenade at the stage. The explosive struck a girl in the crowd, but because it had been wrapped in a red piece of cloth, the firing pin failed to come out, preventing a blast. The FBI later stated that had the grenade went off, it could have killed the president. Last year, two men, Glendon Scott Crawford, 49, and Eric J. Feight, 54, were charged with conspiracy to support terrorism for building a portable X-ray machine, which they allegedly planned to use to poison Muslims and President Obama with a lethal dose of radiation. The harebrained plot was ultimately foiled thanks to undercover federal agents who provided the would-be assassins with faulty parts for their 'death ray' after learning of their scheme. During his two terms in office, President Reagan became the target of multiple assassination attempts, most famously in 1981, when John Hinckley shot him in a desperate bid to impress actress Jody Foster. This photo taken by presidential photographer Mike Evens on March 30, 1981 shows police and Secret Service agents reacting during the assassination attempt on then US president Ronald Reagan, after a conference outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C. Assasin: John Hinckley Jr. (L) escorted by police in Washington, DC, following his arrest after shooting and seriously wounding Reagan . Army veteran Francisco Martin Duran fired 29 shots at the White House during an attempt on Bill Clinton's life . An investigator measures a bullet hole on a window of the White House press room, Monday Oct. 31, 1994, after Duran's attack . But few people know that the Gipper was also stalked by a man who called himself 'Catman,' and who sent threatening letters supplemented with close-up photos of his targets - and pictures of cats . When he was finally arrested in 1983, the Secret Service discovered photos of the suspect outside Gracie Mansion during Reagan’s visit to New York City. Ayton writes: 'Catman had been close enough to shoot President Reagan, but his shot had apparently been blocked by agents.' In 1978, a man named Anthony Henry, 35, attempted to confront Reagan’s predecessor, Jimmy Carter, at the White House to take him task over the placement of the phrase 'In God We Trust' on banknotes, which he deemed blasphemous. On February 15, 1933, Giuseppe Zangara, a bricklayer from New Jersey, fired shots at President-elect Franklin Roosevelt during an event in Miami . In 1950, Harry Truman was targeted by a pair of Puerto Rican nationalists while staying at Blair House during renovations at the White House . Money issue: In 1978, a man named Anthony Henry, 35, attempted to confront Reagan¿s predecessor, Jimmy Carter, at the White House over the placement of the phrase 'in God We Trust' on banknotes . As part of his plan, Henry put on a karate gi and scaled the fence surrounding the president's residence on Pennsylvania Avenue. But the shoeless martial arts enthusiast was surrounded by police officers before he had a chance to approach the first family's living quarters. The new non-fiction book Hunting the President: Threats, Plots, and Assassination Attempts ¿ from FDR to Obama' by historian Mel Ayton details plots to kill the president . After a tense 15-minte standoff, during which Henry slashed two officers with a knife, he was finally taken into custody. More than a decade later, the White House became the setting of another attempt on the president's life, this time targeting Bill Clinton. October 29, 1994, Army veteran Francisco Martin Duran walked to the presidential residence wearing a trench coat and armed to the teeth. When he spotted a man resembling Mr Clinton, he opened fire. Of the 29 rounds shot by Duran, five struck the White House's wall and three broke a window. After police arrested the suspect, they found an atlas with the words 'Kill the Pres' scrawled on the cover. Unfortunately, not all assassination plots were thwarted without bloodshed. In 1950, two White House police officers were shot while protecting Harry Truman from a pair of Puerto Rican nationalists who launched an attack on Blair House across the street from the White House, which was undergoing a renovation at the time . Truman escaped injury, but police officer Leslie Coffelt died from a gunshot wound to the head. Before succumbing to his fatal injury, the heroic White House cop was able to take out one of the assailants. Crackpots: Last year, Glendon Scott Crawford (right), 49, and Eric J. Feight (left), 54, were charged with conspiracy to support terrorism for building an X-ray machine . The duo allegedly planned to use the portable 'death ray' device to poison Muslims and President Obama with a lethal dose of radiation . On February 15, 1933, Giuseppe Zangara, a bricklayer from New Jersey, fired shots at President-elect Franklin Roosevelt during an event in Miami. The bullets missed the future architect of the New Deal by two feet, but struck Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who later died from his wounds, reportedly telling FDR, 'I'm glad it was me and not you.' Zangara, who was ultimately sentenced to death, confessed to the crime, declaring: 'I have the gun in my hand. I kill kings and presidents first and next all capitalists.'","Historian Mel Ayton's new book hunting the President tells how a Secret Service agent pointed a sub-machine gun at President Johnson's chest .

"Fiona Woolf re-wrote a letter to the Home Secretary seven times to play down links to Leon Brittan . The head of the Government’s child abuse inquiry re-wrote a letter to the Home Secretary seven times in order to play down her links to Leon Brittan, it was claimed yesterday. Fiona Woolf is already under pressure to resign because of her personal relationship to the Tory peer, who is at the centre of allegations of an Establishment cover-up of sex abuse claims in the 1980s. It has now emerged that she made several changes to a formal letter she sent to Theresa May about possible conflicts of interest. With assistance from the Home Office, she made more than half a dozen alterations to the document to remove language that alluded to her closeness to the Conservative grandee. The different versions of the letter emerged yesterday two days after a Labour MP used parliamentary privilege to link Lord Brittan to ‘improper conduct with children’. Victims described the latest revelations as ‘extraordinary’ and renewed their calls on City lawyer Mrs Woolf to step down. Former home secretary Leon Brittan strenuously denies accusations that he is at the centre of a cover-up over historic sex abuse claims. It is alleged that, while in charge of the Home Office, he ignored a document – which later went missing – that described a paedophile ring involving high-profile figures. Mrs Woolf, who was appointed last month to lead the investigation, wrote a letter to current Home Secretary Mrs May to list her possible conflicts of interests. She lists five dinner parties among the contacts she has had with Lord Brittan and his wife, who live on the same street as her. As well as inviting the Brittans to dinner at her house three times, Mrs Woolf dined at theirs twice, met Lady Brittan for coffee, sat on a prize-giving panel with her, and sponsored her £50 for a fun run. Yesterday the home affairs select committee published the seven drafts that showed the letter was repeatedly amended. Committee chairman Keith Vaz MP said the re-writes gave a sense of ‘detachment’ between Lord and Lady Brittan and Mrs Woolf. Saying the letter ‘raises more questions than it answers’, he said facts as well as words were altered. ‘It is extraordinary that Mrs Woolf did not even write the first draft of her letter, which was supposed to detail her own personal experiences. ‘The letter then underwent seven drafts with a multiplicity of editors. The final version gave a sense of greater detachment between Lord and Lady Brittan and Mrs Woolf than her previous attempts.’ Early versions of the letter detailing the dinner parties include language such as ‘I returned the compliment’ and ‘we engaged in another exchange of dinner parties’. But this was deleted in the final version. In one of the first drafts, she wrote: ‘I live on the same street as the Brittan’s (sic)’. But it was changed to ‘I have had a house in London as the same street as the Brittans’. Scroll down for video . Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz said his committee could recall Mrs Woolf to give evidence . Mrs Woolf hosted a drinks reception for City dignitaries, including Lord Brittan, above right, where they were introduced to French premier Francois Fillon, above left, in 2011 . Labour MP Mr Vaz said the committee would decide next week if Mrs Woolf should be recalled to give further evidence. He said lessons had not been learned since the appointment of the previous head of the inquiry, Baroness Butler-Sloss. She was forced to resign after it emerged her brother, Michael Havers, may have had to make legal decisions about abuse allegations in his role as attorney general in the 1980s. In the letter, Mrs Woolf – who is the Lord Mayor of London – stated that she had no ‘social contact’ with Lord and Lady Brittan since April 23 last year. But a photo emerged of her chatting to Lady Brittan at a prize-giving last October. Mrs Woolf (left) pictured with Lady Brittan (right), Lord Brittan's wife, at a party last year . Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk has called for Mrs Woolf to step down as chair of the sex abuse inquiry . Yesterday she said she did not recall any ‘substantial interaction’ with Lady Brittan at the event. Alison Millar, a solicitor representing around 50 alleged abuse victims, repeated her call for Mrs Woolf to be replaced. She said: ‘This response by Mrs Woolf will only cement in the minds of my clients that she is not the right person to head this inquiry.’ MP Jim Hood used parliamentary privilege in the Commons on Tuesday to say there were ‘reports about child abuse being linked with’ Lord Birttan, now 75. A Home Office spokesman last night said: ‘We remain confident Fiona Woolf and the panel members can carry out their duties to the highest standards of impartiality and integrity.’","Fiona Woolf drafted seven letters to Theresa May over links to Lord Brittan .

"There are numerous studies that attempt to rank countries based on economy and population, but few look at what these countries contribute to the rest of the world on an educational, cultural and humanitarian level. The Good Country Index attempts to change that by highlighting the nations and regions that give the most in terms of peace, science and technology, climate and health. Ireland tops the index’s overall rankings - beating 124 countries to the accolade - and is also the highest ranking country in terms of prosperity - which factors in fair trading for example - and equality, according to the new research. Explore the Good Country Index rankings in the chart below . The Good Country Index is the brainchild of independent policy advisor Simon Anholt. He used 35 datasets covering 125 countries to break the list into seven categories, including Science and Technology, Culture, International Peace and Security, World Order, Planet and Climate, Prosperity and Equality, Health and Wellbeing. 'Good' is defined as 'a measure of how much a country contributes to the common good' The UK ranks highest for science and technological contributions, Iceland tops the Planet and Climate list, and Belgium was found to be the most cultural. Elsewhere, Germany is top of the World Order list, which looked at charity giving and population growth, and Spain provides the most in terms of food and humanitarian aid. The Good Country Index is the brainchild of independent policy advisor Simon Anholt. He said he wanted to attempt to measure how much each country on Earth contributes to the planet and to the human race. Simon Anholt used 35 datasets, . created by the United Nations, NGOs and other international agencies to . track what countries offer, across seven categories. These . include Science and Technology, Culture, International Peace and . Security, World Order, Planet and Climate, Prosperity and Equality, and . Health and Wellbeing. These . datasets were combined into a common measure to get an overall ranking, a . ranking in each of the seven categories, and a balance-sheet for each . country that shows at a glance how much it contributes to the world, and . how much it takes away. More technically, countries received . scores on each indicator as a fractional rank, relative to all countries . for which data is available. The category rankings are based on the . mean fractional ranks per category, and the overall rank was based on . the average of the category ranks. Only . countries that were featured in the datasets were included, leaving a . total of 125 countries, and the majority of data was taken from complete . sets created in 2010. ‘The biggest challenges facing humanity today are global and borderless: climate change, economic crisis, terrorism, drug trafficking, slavery, pandemics, poverty and inequality, population growth, food and water shortages, energy, species loss, human rights, migration - the list goes on,’ explained Anholt. ‘All of these problems stretch across national borders, so the only way they can be properly tackled is through international efforts. ‘The trouble is, most countries carry on behaving as if they were islands, focusing on developing domestic solutions to domestic problems. 'We’ll never get anywhere unless we start to change this habit.’ Ireland tops the index's overall rankings (pictured far left) - beating 124 countries to the accolade - and is also the highest ranking country when it comes to prosperity and equality. Libya contributes the least. The numbers under the individual headings show where that country ranks within each category.

Anholt added that the Good Country Index . focuses more on what a country is doing, rather than its economic status . and the researchers define ‘good’ in their study ‘as a measure of how . much a country contributes to the common good.’ In this context ‘good’ means the opposite of ‘selfish’, not the opposite of ‘bad’, and Anholt claims ‘the Good Country Index isn’t trying to make any moral judgments: it just measures, as objectively as possible, what each country contributes to the common good, and what it takes away.’ Anholt used 35 datasets, created by the United Nations, NGOs and other international agencies to track the way that most countries act, across seven categories. These include Science and Technology, Culture, International Peace and Security, World Order, Planet and Climate, Prosperity and Equality, and Health and Wellbeing.

'Our method is simple to understand and something that was relatively insensitive to outliers. Frankly the precise position of a country in a table does not matter that much. ‘What matters much more is each country’s balance sheet and the gross positions in the table. Countries in the top twenty are doing a lot for the common good. ‘Those in the bottom twenty are hindering the common good, or at least are free-riders on other countries. Countries in the middle are doing something in between.’ They added that they hope people will see not only how well their county is contributing to the common good but also how they are doing it. ‘The fact that domestic behaviour isn’t included in the Good Country Index of course doesn’t mean we excuse, condone, minimise or overlook it in any way: it’s simply not the thing that we’re measuring.’ A map showing the top 5 'good countries' which includes Ireland, Finland and Switzerland.

"A father-of-three was beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of as many as 15 thugs who stole his wedding ring and mobile phone. Joseph Frederic, 38, was punched to the ground before the gang repeatedly kicked him and stamped on his head. Mr Frederic, who was visiting from France, had attended a family friend’s birthday party in Langley Green, Crawley. Beaten to a pulp: Joseph Frederic was savagely beaten by a gang of up to 15 people after a birthday party in Crawley, suffering multiple facial fractures . At around 2am Mr Frederic went outside to look for his wife and was set upon by the gang in the club's car park. After the attack the gang fled and a local resident said the gang had a taxi waiting for them. Mr Joseph, who is French Mauritian, was taken to the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead for surgery to repair a series of facial fractures. Because of the extent of his injuries he was not allowed to fly home and instead had to return by Eurostar. He is recovering well from the attack and is now able to speak and eat again as his horrific facial swelling begins to recede. Mr Frederic's friend Sylvio Lynx, 57, said the attack took place around 40 minutes after his son's 18th birthday party had ended on Sunday, October 16. 'He went outside because he was looking for his wife,' said Mr Lynx. 'They took his ring, his necklace and his phone. He could not see the attackers because it was dark. He cannot describe the faces of those who did it.' The only description Mr Frederic was able to offer police is that he believes all the attackers were black. Detective Constable Mike George said: 'This was an attack on a man visiting this country.

But Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani told MailOnline it is a ’serious allegation’ which the government ’refutes completely’. It is claimed British firms working on Qatar World Cup venues have been denied money which has been redirected to ISIS extremists . Labour MP Steve Rotheram raised the cases in Parliament ahead of David Cameron holding talks with the Emir of Qatar tomorrow. It is claimed British firms working on Qatar World Cup venues have been denied money which has been redirected to ISIS extremists Critics want pressure to be put on Qatar to stop the flow of money between rich donors and extremists threatening countries around the world. Qatar controversially won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, despite widespread concern that soaring temperatures will make games impossible to play. Several British construction firms have won contracts to work for big Qatari firms on building venues in the country. However, Mr Rotherham claimed that companies have had money withheld which has been redirected to Islamic extremists in Syria. In a statement, the Qatari Prime Minister said: ’It is a serious allegation and it is one we refute completely. ’Let me be clear, for the avoidance of doubt, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the Middle East and around the world to face down the terrorist threat.’ Earlier in the Commons, Mr Rotherham, the MP for Liverpool Walton, called on ministers to examine the allegations. Speaking during Foreign Office question time, Mr Rotheram said: 'There are accusations that some UK companies are being short-changed on contracts associated with the construction of World Cup venues in Qatar and even claims that some monies unpaid are being siphoned off to Syria and into the hands of Isil.' He told Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood: 'Can you look urgently to these allegations and can you offer support to UK firms regarding their reimbursement by the Qatari royalty, government or businesses?' Mr Ellwood replied: 'I was in Doha last week and I raised this very issue. They do what is called a kafala system which has now been upgraded, which you may be aware of. 'It is being replaced to give greater rights to migrant workers - there's 1.3 million in Qatar - but also giving responsibilities to the employers as well to make sure they look after these. 'It is something that will be raised this week when the Emir of Qatar visits this country.' Mr Cameron is expected to meet with Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, tomorrow afternoon for bilateral talks in Downing Street. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar, is  visiting London this week to promote economic investment in Britain . In August Qatar denied supporting ISIS militants, insisting that 'determined, collective action' was needed to end sectarian violence in Iraq and Syria. And  officials including Qatar's director of intelligence told the BBC that the country only supported moderate rebel groups in Syria and 'had nothing to hide'. But this week a US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington believes Turkey is partnering with Qatar in providing support to Islamist factions and militias in Libya. At the weekend Tory MP Stephen Barclay told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It remains unclear whether money is still flowing from Qatari nationals. 'There is clear evidence that Qatari nationals have been instrumental in the financing of Sunni terror groups and the Prime Minister should not avoid tackling this issue head on with the Emir.' Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the meeting was a 'perfect opportunity' to tell the Qataris they could no longer 'run with the hare and hunt with the hounds'. Foreign Office minister Baroness Jay said this week that ISIS's main sources of revenue come from oil sales and extortion. But other sources have included foreign donors, kidnap ransom payments, and money stolen during its advances in recent months. She added: 'We are working with countries in the Middle East to counter the threat from terrorists and extremists across the region. Combating ISIL and degrading its financial support is a priority and we continue to discuss these issues with our partners, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar. 'We are working closely with all our international partners to intensify efforts to stem ISIL's funding flows.'","Labour MP Steve Rotheram raises allegations in the House of Commons .

"Globetrotting Mike Spencer Bown is finally heading home after 23 years of traveling the world and visiting 195 countries. Mr Spencer Bown, 44, could be the most traveled man in history after a marathon odyssey which has taken him from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and every nation in between.

"Michelle Obama and her daughters spent Presidents Day weekend enjoying private lessons with numerous instructors at a top skiing resort in Aspen, Colorado, it has emerged. The Obama girls, shadowed by security, enjoyed the hospitality of wealthy Democratic donors Jim and Paula Crown - and angered other visitors by shutting airspace so they could land their plane. Their trip came as President Obama golfed with Tiger Woods in Florida - a day out that was kept under wraps from the public and the media despite the taxpayer footing much of the massive bill. Hitting the slopes: Michelle Obama and her . daughters have spent Presidents Day weekend skiing in Aspen, Colorado. These pictures show the First Lady on the slopes at the same resort last year . In Aspen, Michelle, Sasha and Malia, as well as a few friends, headed to the slopes for all-day private lessons with numerous pro skiers from the Ski and Snowboard School of Aspen, the New York Post revealed. All-day courses with the school cost between $107 and $200 per person, but the White House said the First Family was picking up the tab. 'The first lady and the Obama daughters are on a private family trip to Colorado,' a spokesperson said. 'Personal expenses are being paid for by the Obamas.' The same weekend trip to Aspen last year cost at least $83,182.99, Judicial Watch reported, with the flight costs at $22,583.70. Kellie MacMullan, from KWGN, said she happened to be at the resort at Vail when she noticed Michelle Obama and her pack of security guards. Resort: The Obamas took on slopes at Buttermilk Mountain, where the Winter X Games (pictured) are held . 'When we got up to the lift there were huge crowds of people for Presidents Day and she and her crew just came right to the front of the line right to those lifts and kind of made a big deal out of it,' MacMullan said. Hospitality: They stayed at the home of Jim Crown, pictured, a Democratic donor who owns four ski resorts . Other skiers told the Post that the Obamas stuck to the beginner 'Panda Pipe' area of Buttermilk Mountain, staying away from the more challenging peaks used for the Winter X Games. 'There were crowds of security guards dressed in black around them, all parked off the bunny slopes,' one said. 'Michelle and the girls were mainly going out each morning before the lifts opened.' Other visitors were reportedly annoyed that the Obamas plane blocked airspace, meaning other private jets could not land, or had to be diverted, the Post reported. The First Family stayed with Aspen . Ski Company owners Jim and Paula Crown, Democratic donors who own four . ski mountain resorts. The security team stayed at another house next . door. The first lady was last in Aspen in July, when she attended a fundraiser at the Crown's home for around 100 people. Their trip came as President Obama enjoyed a relaxing golf weekend veiled in secrecy. He was on the course on Monday for the third and final day of a Florida vacation with departing US Trade Representative Ron Kirk, the president's Chicago pal Eric Whitaker and White House aide Marvin Nicholson. He . had enjoyed a round of golf with Tiger Woods on Sunday - a fact that . only emerged by chance after media were banned from attending the event. VIDEO FLASHBACK: Michelle Obama on the slopes in Aspen in 2011 . Girls' trip: The Obama girls, pictured in January, took private ski lessons on beginner slopes over the weekend . The traveling pool of journalists who . follow the President's every move were reportedly furious after being . shut out of his round of golf and not being allowed on to the club grounds. The . President waved as he jogged up the steps of Air Force One at Palm . Beach International Airport on Monday evening while a White House aide . heaved golf clubs and large bags on board. He had been relaxing on a trip to the Floridian, an exclusive club along the Treasure Coast. The . club's owner is Jim Crane, a Houston businessman who also owns . baseball's Houston Astros. Crane also has given money to Obama's . political campaigns. The White House had barred media coverage of the president's golf holiday but released the names of his partners. Back in the swing of things: President Obama waves in the doorway of Air Force One as he departs from Palm Beach International Airport on Monday . Extra baggage: A White House aide carries the golf bag of Eric Whitaker, Obama's long-time friend, aboard the plane after their boys' weekend at a luxury golf resort . $943,687.50: estimated cost of a trip for Air Force One from Chicago to West Palm Beach and then back to Washington, D.C. $13,500: Cost to rent out three four-bedroom guest cottages at The Floridian for three nights . $24,000: Cost of an eight-hour private golf lesson with famed instructor Butch Harmon . $1,800: Greens fees for three guests for two rounds of golf . $1,600: Cost of four caddies for two rounds of golf . $4,620: . Cost of 20 rooms at the Port St. Lucie Holiday Inn for traveling press . and security detail based on the government per-diem rate . TOTAL: $989,207 . The outrage over the lack of . transparency came as much of the bill for the trip will be paid . for by tax payers, yet Obama did not feel it appropriate to . even release one photo of his time out the course. The . President played with the notorious philanderer on Sunday after getting . a private lesson from Woods' former coach the day before. However the only . inside reports about the rounds came from a golf journalist who happened . to be in the clubhouse at the time. The . President's deputy press secretary Josh Earnest responded to the pool's . concerns by simply saying that they were previously told about the . level of access - or lack thereof - that they should expect from the . weekend. MailOnline . has calculated that his entire trip incurred costs of $989,207, . including the sum of Air Force One journeys, cottage rentals, golf . lessons, greens fees and accommodation for security. During . his round on Saturday, the President played with Crane as well as . U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk. He also played at least one round with his close friend Eric .

"Wearing a Savile Row suit, designer shoes and a luxury brand watch, Prince Harry looked every inch the royal at a reception at St James's Palace earlier this week. But despite spending around £8,000 on his outfit for the day, it has been revealed he topped off the look with a pair of bargain bin golf socks, which cost just £1.66 a pair. The Prince hosted an engagement with New York Knicks basketball star Carmelo Anthony on Wednesday in aid of the Core Coach programme, an apprentice scheme run for jobless young people by the Royal Foundation. Scroll down for video . Despite Prince Harry spending £8,000 on the rest of his outfit for an engagement at St James's Palace earlier this week, it was revealed he was wearing bargain golf socks, which cost just £1.66 a pair. Not to be outdone, basketball star Carmelo Anthony, who joined Prince Harry at the event, also made a statement with his socks by wearing a brightly yellow and blue pair . Harry dressed smartly wearing a bespoke Savile Row suit and shirt thought to cost around £3,690. He was also wearing personalised John Lobb leather shoes worth £1,500 and a £3,150 Breitling watch, according to the Sun. But when the 30-year-old sat down for an official photo with the sports star, he revealed his black Dunlop golf socks, which can be bought in a pack of three for just £5. Not to be outdone, Mr Anthony, wearing a checked black suit, also made a statement with his socks, wearing a brightly coloured yellow and blue pair. At the reception in aid of the Royal Foundation's Coach Core programme, Harry was presented with his own personalised basketball shirt . The Prince and the sportsman burst into fits of laughter when the royal was also presented with a single orange shoe . The palace reception saw Harry make his first public appearance of 2015, and the Prince appeared to enjoy the company of the six foot eight inch sportsman, despite him towering over the six foot two inch royal. And the fashion theme continued when Mr Anthony presented Harry with his own personalised training shirt with the name Wales on the back. However, the pair burst into fits of giggles when the Prince was given a single orange shoe. Still chuckling, he promptly told a smiling Anthony that he would have to come to his upcoming game in London to collect the other one. 'And I love the shirt,' he added. The duo were joined for the reception by Congolese basketball star Dikembe Mutombo, 48, who, at 7ft 1"", towered over Anthony as well, and British basketball player John Amaechi. The pair appeared to enjoy each other's company at the event earlier in the week with Harry standing on his toes to try and appear as tall as his guest, right . And speaking to the 33 newly qualified sports coaches who were trained via the programme, Harry said: 'This is not where it ends but where it starts. 'When my brother, Catherine and I launched the Coach Core programme back in 2012, we had a vision of young people being inspired to become amazing sports coaches for their communities and beyond: Young people, who would in turn, inspire others to change their lives through sport. 'Like many others, we had been profoundly moved by the excitement of the London Olympics - a celebration of sporting achievement. 'Of course, this level of excellence is only possible through an immense amount of hard work by the athletes, their coaches, mentors and all those who support them on their journey to greatness.'","Prince Harry hosted an engagement with basketball star Carmelo Anthony .

"Diesel’s artistic director Nicola Formichetti has cast a wheelchair-bound fashion editor and blogger in its spring 2014 campaign. Jillian Mercado - a 26-year-old New Yorker who suffers from muscular dystrophy - stars in the label’s 'We Are Connected' campaign. The campaign sees her posed alongside visual artist James Astronaut in a denim dress, bright red lipstick and her signature platinum blonde hair, making it clear how Mr Formichetti consciously decided to feature, rather than hide her electric wheelchair in the photo. Cover girl: Jillian Mercado (right), a 26-year-old fashion editor, stars in Diesel's new spring campaign . She told MailOnline that she hopes the ad ‘gives hope to people who are maybe saying, “My life is over” because they are disabled. You can totally do it, nothing should be stopping you.’ The campaign - photographed by the acclaimed duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin - will run in the March issues of magazines including Vogue and Interview, and will also be displayed on the walls of every single Diesel store worldwide. Miss Mercado first met Mr Formichetti through a shoot produced by We The Urban magazine, where she works as the executive editorial director. A few months later, she saw that his assistant put out a casting call for young, culturally-representative models to join Diesel as a campaign ambassador. Miss Mercado and her friends decided to enter the lot as a ‘joke’ she said. Model citizen: Miss Mercado says that those in similar physical situations should not let their disabilities affect their success and dreams . But then, ‘a few weeks later I got an . email from the casting agency that said “Hey can you send us more . pictures? We are kind of interested in having you in the campaign.”’ Out of disbelief, Miss Mercado responded with an assortment of Facebook and Instagram photos. Following . a few days of deliberation, she was chosen to star in the campaign . among 23 tastemakers hailing from her own generation. 'You don’t have to be a conventional model type to represent a brand' Miss Mercado was not aware when the . campaign would become public and on Tuesday morning woke up to see that . Mr Formichetti had ‘tagged’ her in a photo on Instagram, signaling the . campaign’s surprise release. In an interview with Women’s Wear Daily, . Mr Formichetti indicated that Miss Mercado was his favorite cast member . of the campaign’s total 23 participants, who were picked to represent . different sects of youth culture (including Japanese Internet stars and . tattooed models). ‘It’s never easy for her to move from point A to point B, but she’s totally fearless and has really been an inspiration to me,’ he told the paper. ‘You don’t have to be a conventional model type to represent a brand.’ Street style: Miss Mercado is often photographed at fashion events for her bold style . Miss Mercado admitted that she . ‘always gets scared [of the public’s reaction to her disability]. You . never know, there are a lot of people who hate, or a lot of people who . are not comfortable with the situation. ‘I always have it in the back of my mind “Don’t be surprised if someone hates on the photo.”’ But . when Mr Formichetti released her image on his Instagram feed yesterday . morning, the overall response ‘was completely amazing,’ she told us. Miss Mercado thinks that Mr Formichetti’s decision to use her in the campaign represents something ‘so much bigger than just an ad. ‘ . Drawing on her own experiences, Miss Mercado said ‘I know some people look at me and say “Oh wow, I can’t believe you’re doing this” and in my head I think, “Why don’t you believe me?” I went to college, I did what everyone else did to follow their dreams.’ Fellow stars: Miss Mercado stars alongside Japanese Internet stars Ryu Goda and Hirari Ikeda . Tattoo fringe: Heavily-tattooed models Nik Hampshire, Robert Nelson and Ricki Hall also take a starring role in the campaign . In fact, Miss Mercado did that . ten-fold. This writer attended college with Miss Mercado at the Fashion . Institute of Technology and for 4 years watched her commute to the . school’s downtown Manhattan campus via a grueling series of multiple bus . and subway transfers, as the city’s mass-transit system is not fully . wheelchair accessible. Rather than appearing discouraged or . frustrated, one could say that Miss Mercado came off as decidedly more . cheerful, driven, and pleasant than the school’s average student. During . her time in college, Miss Mercado completed internships at Veranda . magazine, Allure, and with the society photographer Patrick McMullan – . establishments that all embraced her disability. Miss Mercado says that there is no reason for people in similar physical situations not to pursue their dreams. ‘Maybe their family doesn’t want them . to pursue something because they don’t want them to get hurt, and yeah, . you will get hurt, I won’t lie to you. It just depends on how badly you . want it.’ Diesel's spring advertisements mark Mr Formichetti’s second commercial outing for the brand. Fashion education: Miss Mercado studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and interned at Allure magazine as well as with society photographer Patrick McMullan . He was appointed as the struggling label’s artistic director last year after holding a similar position within the French house of Thierry Mugler. Mr Formichetti has aptly named his outlook for Diesel as a ‘reboot’, and is working to target denim-loving millennials through a series of tactful marketing schemes – much of which has relied on his strong social media presence. Miss Mercado thinks that her feature in this new campaign is effective in how it shows that ‘anyone can wear Diesel – You don’t have to be a supermodel, you don’t have to be a millionaire, you can wear it no matter who you are and what you look like.’","Diesel artistic director Nicola Formichetti said that Jillian Mercado is his favorite participant in the brand's spring advertisements .

"Hatem Ben Arfa could retire from football after being denied permission to play for Nice this season, his lawyer has told French radio station RMC. FIFA ruled earlier this month that the 27-year-old cannot appear for the Ligue 1 club because he has already turned out for Hull City – during a loan spell – and Newcastle Under-21s, which was classed as an official fixture. Rules state that a player can be registered with three clubs in any one season but can only play for two of those – emergency loans apart. Hatem Ben Arfa is set to leave Nice after being told he could not play for them until next season . The former Newcastle United midfielder was released from his contract at St James' Park . Ben Arfa played for Hull City during an ill-fated loan spell  and Newcastle's development side . Ben Arfa – who was released by Newcastle before signing for Nice earlier this month - is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday regarding his future. However, Sportsmail understands that a move to MLS remains a possibility for Ben Arfa given that their 2015 season starts in March. FIFA regulations state that 'players may be registered with a maximum of three clubs during one season. During this period, the player is only eligible to play official matches for two clubs'. The Ligue 1 side had attempted to appeal against the ruling, but the Nice Administrative Court upheld FIFA's original decision, according to France Football. He is now eligible to play for Newcastle and Hull before the end of the season. The 27-year-old has experienced disciplinary issues at each of his past four clubs in England and France . On Sunday Ben Arfa admitted his frustration over the stalled move on Nice's website. 'I do not understand why they would try to stop me from playing in France, my home, and say I should be in England or somewhere else,' he said. 'Why always try to create problems when there are none? 'I have only one desire - to play again on the pitches of Ligue 1, to have fun with my team-mates, and to give pleasure to the fans who have welcomed me as ever.' For Ben Arfa, it's a frustrating conclusion to what's been a difficult season. He began the campaign frozen out at Newcastle, before a loan switch to Hull in which he managed just nine appearances.","Hatem Ben Arfa to make announcement on Tuesday regarding his future .

"Head teachers reacted with anger yesterday after a ski company offered to pay the truancy fines of parents who take their children on term-time holidays. The firm, which is selling trips to Morzine in the French Alps, will cover penalties imposed on parents who break rules by taking their children out of school. MountainBase advertised the offer with the slogan: ‘Are schools in the UK taking the Piste? We think so.’ But heads branded the gimmick ‘irresponsible’ and ‘extremely unhelpful’. Offer: Travel company MountainBase is offering parents the chance to take their children skiing without having to fork out fines imposed under new Government rules, which makes taking children out of school without permission for a holiday a criminal offence . The advert, posted on Facebook and on the Bedford-based operator’s website, reads: ‘We have a special offer which is as follows – Book a week with children at MountainBase/Inferno. ‘We will, if you receive a fine from your school/local authority, pay the fine on copy of a receipt from yourselves. This is based on any booking in March/April except the free ski pass option.’ New rules introduced last year severely curtail the discretion of head teachers to allow parents to take their children on term-time holidays. They used to be able to grant up to ten days in certain ‘special circumstances’. But now they must follow tougher  criteria, ruling out holidays for all but ‘exceptional’ reasons such as attending funerals. Parents who take their children out of school without consent risk a fine of £60, rising to £120 if it is unpaid within seven days. Refusal to pay can mean a maximum fine of £2,500 and up to three years in jail. Rising numbers of parents are being hit with charges after the Government hardened its stance. MountainBase owner Lee Quince said . the rule change unfairly targeted parents who simply wish to give their . children different experiences. ‘The . whole change regarding term-time holidays, which was aimed at tackling . the problem of truancy, has directly affected families who want to take . their children on holiday but cannot afford to go. 'That is because prices are so high during school holidays,’ he said. ‘The Government was targeting compulsive truants but has hit innocent families who just want to teach their kids how to ski.’ Asked . if he was being ‘irresponsible’, he said: ‘Yes, in one way but also the . law has changed to specifically address truancy, especially in the wake . of the riots. ‘In some sense that’s affecting people who are not in that set, it’s a law change not destined for themselves.’ Slogan: MountainBase owner Lee Quince said: 'The whole change regarding term-time holidays, which was aimed at tackling the problem of truancy, has directly affected families who want to take their children on holiday but cannot afford to go' Advertising: The company posted this message on its Facebook page, offering to pay fines incurred by parents who take their children skiing in term-time . He told Radio 5 Live: ‘Parents know the situation at the time and whether or not their children are doing well in school. ‘We are offering something that is only available at certain times of the year. Also, it is a sporting holiday and not just sitting on the beach.’ Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘This is extremely unhelpful. ‘Travel companies should be supporting the education system by offering competitive prices and offering incentives for parents to take children away during the school holidays. ‘These rules about attendance have been introduced because children need to be in school.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Parents should never discount a possible penalty from the cost of a cheaper holiday. ‘Taking children out of school without permission for a holiday is a criminal offence. By doing so  parents are risking prosecution.’","Firm MountainBase is offering to help parents get round the new rules .

"A new documentary, which airs tonight on PBS, explores the psychology behind yellow fever - the phenomenon that sees white men attracted to, and sometimes even obsessed with, Asian women. Filmed and directed by Debbie Lum, a fourth-generation Chinese-American from St Louis, Missouri, Seeking Asian Female looks to discover why many men see Asians as ideal wives, a concept that is 'very painful for the Asian-American community,' Ms Lum told ABC News. According to the filmmaker, there is an overriding perception that women of that particular race are more docile and make for obedient life partners, a stereotype that is offensive and often untrue. Scroll down for trailer . Love or fetish? Steven (right) spent years searching for an Asian mate before settling on Sandy (left). The couple are the subject of Seeking Asian Female, a new documentary that explores the concept of yellow fever . Indeed, according to Goal Auzeen Saedi, a post-doctoral fellow in counseling at Stanford University, the dominant perception is that women from Asia are 'submissive'. In a 2011 Psychology Today article, Dr Saedi explained that the men who desire Asian women - most of them Caucasians themselves - are sending an 'underlying message about power, dominance and white privilege'. It is exactly that attitude that Ms Lum sought to expose in her debut feature-length film. 'Every Asian-American woman knows exactly what I am talking about,' she said. 'Men come up to you in a way that really looks like a stare, which lasts a bit longer than it should. 'You can feel it,' she continued. 'It's like they are looking through you.' In the film, Ms Lum follows the lives of Steven, a . twice-divorced 60-year-old on the hunt for an Asian bride, and Sandy, . the Chinese woman half his age whom he meets on the internet and ultimately marries. Fulfilling a fantasy: Steven, 60, brings 30-year-old Sandy home from China to be his wife. 'I'm happy as a clam,' he says in the trailer as he introduces his bride-to-be to the filmmaker . According to the website for the . documentary, Steven first became interested in Asian women after . witnessing the success of his son's marriage to a Japanese immigrant. The 60-year-old, who works as a garage . attendant at the San Francisco airport, spent years looking through . mail-order catalogs and dating websites, trying to find the perfect . mate. 'Over the course of the last five . years there must be hundreds of different girls from China that I've . been writing to,' he explains in a trailer for the movie. 'Men come up to Asian-American women, and it's like they are looking through them' Finally, Steven meets Sandy - a 30-year-old factory worker who grew up on a tea farm in the remote mountains of China. He flies out to Sandy's home country to meet her, and two weeks later he returns to California with Sandy in tow, after she agrees to marry him. 'I'm happy as a clam,' he says in the trailer with a boyish grin as he introduces his fiancee to the film director. But while Steven has fulfilled his fantasy by having a relationship with an Asian woman, the couple soon begins to struggle to communicate, since Sandy's English is basic and Steven doesn't speak a word of Chinese. The trailer shows them bickering, with neither able to understand the other. 'What?' Steven yells to Sandy at one point. 'Speak in English!' Issues: The couple - neither of whom speak each other's language well - soon begin to struggle to communicate with each other. 'I have no idea what she's saying,' admits Steven . Ms Lum, who speaks Chinese, becomes a translator and mediator as both Sandy and Steven turn to her . to resolve their issues. Steven admits to the filmmaker: '[Sandy] has read a lot of things to me in Chinese. I feel . comfortable with it, but I have no idea what she's saying.' Ultimately though, their relationship works after Steven realizes that he can love Sandy despite her fiery temper, a trait which contradicts the stereotypical picture of an Asian female. Today, Sandy and Steven have been happily married for four years. 'Yellow fever is very painful for the Asian-American community' '[Steven's] obsession with any Asian . woman has been replaced with a real-live Sandy,' explains Ms Lum, who . admits that her own preconception of Steven was perhaps just as bad as . those she sought to debunk about Asian women. Still, Ms Lum said she hopes the film . will start a conversation about negative categorizations in general - . including those involving men like Steven. 'The story is about expectations and stereotypes, which are very related,' she said. 'Stereotypes about white guys, and expectations going into a relationship.' Seeking Asian Female airs on PBS on Monday, May 6, at 10pm Eastern Time .

"Up to 2,000 British jihadists have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join terror group ISIS, a Labour MP has warned. Young British Muslims are flocking to the war-torn countries to fight for the extremist group after being radicalised online and by softer groups, Khalid Mahmoud said. The real number of Britons who have joined ISIS since it begun waging war in the Middle Eastern countries is significantly higher than has been revealed by the government, he added. The number of British jihadis who have gone to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS fighters is significantly higher than what is being revealed, an MP has said . Previously it was claimed an estimated 500 Brits had travelled to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS. But Mr Mahmoud said hundreds more had been radicalised. 'The official figures are a huge understatement,' the MP for Birmingham Perry Barr said. 'The true figure for British radicals in Syria and Iraq is closer to 2,000,' he told the Sunday Mirror, adding that the number was 'still rising'. 'Some are being radicalised online. People are still going out with the charities and being radicalised once they are shown.' Khalid Mahmoud (centre) said thousands more youngsters than had been initially revealed had gone to join ISIS . His comments come after Boris Johnson revealed thousands of terror suspects were under close observation across the UK. Of the estimated 500 who had gone to Syria and Iraq, around half are thought to have returned to Britain. Just 60 of those suspects have been arrested. Yesterday he said the capital was 'very, very concerned' about the situation, with the terror alert being raised several times in recent weeks. Five men in their twenties were arrested at a west London address on Friday on suspicion of terror offences. Last month eleven men were detained under similar charges following dawn raids across the capital and in Stoke. Most were released on bail.

"In Norse mythology, Thor’s hammer helped prevent giants from destroying Asgard, the celestial home of the gods. Thousands of tiny intricate amulets, similar to this weapon, have been found all over the Viking world since the first millennium CE. But for years, researchers have been unsure whether the amulets, known as 'torshammere', were a representation of Thor’s hammer or something else entirely. Researchers have been unsure whether the amulets, known as torshammere, were a representation of Thor’s hammer or something else entirely. Now archaeologists have unearthed a 10th century torshammere (pictured) on a Danish island that could finally end the debate . Now, archaeologists have unearthed a 10th century torshammere  in Købelev, on the Danish island of Lolland, that could finally end the debate on how Thor’s legend influenced Viking jewellery. The latest find is unusual as it has runes inscribed that reads 'Hmar x is'  meaning 'This is a Hammer'. ‘It was the amulet’s protective power that counted, and often we see torshammere and Christian crosses appearing together, providing double protection’, said Peter Pentz, an archaeologist at the National Museum of Denmark. An unknown rune writer confirmed that the amulets depicts Thor's hammer (illustration of hammer and runic text, pictured) - a lasting symbol of Viking culture. The fact that the person who made the hammer was literate is a source of fascination for archaeologists . Both sides of the amulet are shown here with runes seen on the left image.  The latest find is unusual as it has runes inscribed that reads 'Hmar x is' (This is a Hammer') In Norse mythology, Thor's hammer helped prevent the giants from destroying Asgard, the home of the gods. Pictured is actor Chris Hemsworth in the 2011 film 'Thor' In Norse mythology, Mjölnir (pronounced roughly 'miol-neer') is the name given to the hammer of Thor, a major Norse god associated with thunder. The hammer is described in Norse mythology as one of the most powerful weapons, capable of levelling mountains. It was used by Thor to guard Asgard, the celestial stronghold of the Aesir, the main tribe of gods and goddesses in Norse mythology. As well as being a weapon, legend has it that Thor's hammer also occupied a key role in religous rituals of cleansing. It was used in formal ceremonies to bless marriages, births, and possibly funerals. In one tale, Thor once killed and ate his goats, then brought them back to life by hallowing their bones with his hammer. This object is cast in bronze and has traces of silver or tin and gold plating, according to a report in Past Horizons. Mr Pentz said he grateful to the unknown rune writer who has confirmed that these amulets do depict Thor’s hammer – a lasting symbol of Viking culture. The fact that the person who made the hammer was literate is a source of fascination for archaeologists. They claim the amulet could indicate that literacy was widespread among craftspeople. The runes range in height from 3 to 7mm, so it required precision to inscribe them onto the amulet. As well as the torshammere, the archaeologists recovered fragments of silver needles and a mould for making brooches. These suggest that there may have been a workshop producing jewellery nearby. Museum Lolland-Falster, who reported the discovery, has no plans to excavate the Viking site at Købelev, but said it will continue metal detector surveys. Thousands of tiny intricate amulets, similar to this weapon, have been found all over the Viking world since the first millennium CE. Pictured are two examples .

"England recovered from a poor start at Twickenham and the early loss of full-back Mike Brown to maintain their RBS Six Nations title title with an emphatic 47-17 victory against England. Sergio Parisse shocked the home side when he powered over in the fourth minute but England replied with tries from Billy Vunipola and Jonathan Joseph to lead 15-5 at half-time. Stuart Lancaster's men added further tries from Ben Youngs, Joseph, Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter in the second half as the Azzurri challenge faded. Host commentator . They made hard work of it at times but England remain unbeaten in this year's Six Nations. Stuart Lancaster's side recovered from a poor start after Sergio Parisse's early try to lead in the second half thanks to tries from Billy Vunipola and Jonathan Joseph. England pulled clear in the second period as Joseph, May and Cor ran riot. Next up for England is a trip to Dublin in two weeks time. A huge encounter awaits at the Aviva Stadium. That man Morisi has had quite the second half. The powerful Italian centre did brilliantly to muscle over in the right corner following a superb break from replacement Giulio Bisegni. Italy keep possession for a sustained period in the England 22 and McLean pokes through a deft grubber but substitute Tomasso Allen can not gather the rebound to touch down. Another recalled England exile crosses the line. Nick Easter has just joined the action but the veteran Harlequins No 8 emerges from a powerful England maul to touch down. Cipriani hooks his conversion effort. England have 10 minutes to rack up some more tries and they look to bump up their points difference on the table... The floodgates have opened. Danny Cipriani has barely been on the field for two minutes and the Sale Sharks fly half has crossed the whitewash. Cipriani ran a great support line to latch onto Jonny May's offload as England cruise out a huge lead . England are cruising now. A rock solid scrum on half allows Youngs to feed Twelvetrees at first receiver before the Gloucester man sends a screen pass to George Ford who puts his Bath team-mate Joseph through a yawning gap in midfield for his second try of the afternoon. Some of England's attacking play has left much to be desired today but George Ford's place kicking has been immaculate. The Bath No 10 knocks over another three-pointer as England begin to pull away. That's poor from Italy. Referee John Lacey awards England a penalty from a collapsed scrum and Ben Youngs shows quick wits to take a quick tap and crash over from close range. Ford fires over the conversion as England establish a 15-point lead. That's the first sign of fatigue from the Azzurri. England will look to put this game to bed and rack up a score in the final quarter surely. That's as good a try as you will see anywhere this season. Italy winger Leonardo Sarto chips the England defence and gathers to set up a great attacking platform. Quick hands from McLean and Haimona release Luca Moris who shows Attwood and Haskell a clean pair of heels to scorch over from 30 metres. Haimona misses the conversion but Italy are right back in this contest again. Silly play from Italy flanker Francesco Minto hands Ford the chance to further increase England's lead early in the second half following a bullocking run by lock Dave Attwood in the build-up. Luke McLean kicks the ball dead as both sides head for the sheds. A thrilling opening half here in Twickenham. Parisse's opening try shocked England into life before Mike Brown's unfortunate injury. Tries from Vunipola and Joseph have steadied the ship for Stuart Lancaster's side but the second half promises to be a fascinating contest. England go to their lineout maul close to the Italian line but Robshaw and Haskell are driven back by the Azzurri pack and are awarded the put-in to the resultant scrum. Amid all the excitement generated by Jonathan Joseph's electric, long-range try, England's coaches will be especially satisfied by Chris Robshaw's breakdown work. Not so long ago, the management were casting doubt on their captain's credentials at the ruck, but he earned the turn-over which paved the way for Joseph's scorching run and finish. Moments later, James Haskell also weighed in with a breakdown 'steal'. An area of previous English weakness is becoming a strength on this evidence. James Haskell is penalised at the breakdown but Haimona fails to punish England as his long-range penalty effort drags to the right and wide. That was a marginal decision by the TMO. Replays seemed to suggest that after Billy Vunipola had crashed over the line and landed on top of Edoardo Gori, the ball had ended up touching the ground, but it wasn't clear if the England No 8 was in control of it at the time. Nonetheless, the try was awarded. Italy will feel aggrieved, but the home side are increasingly asserting themselves after a slow start. What a try from Jonathan Joseph! Chris Robshaw steals the ball on the deck and when the ball is spun out to the Bath centre, he doesn't need a second invitation to stretch his legs. Joseph shows his stunning footwork to step Haimona before setting off on a 40 metre dash to the try line. Awesome from the Bath man. After a stuttering start, England have cruised into a 10-point lead. Great power from Billy Vunipola to power over in the left corner. Vunipola managed to squeeze over following a superb lineout move involving disguised passes from Chris Robshaw and Dave Attwood. George Ford pulls the touchline conversion wide, but England finally have the lead in this game. England have their first points on the board after 18 minutes of play. Haimona has made a great start to the game but he'll be disappointed with his indiscipline at the ruck which allows George Ford to bisect the posts to get his side back in the game. Kelly Haimona has made a sensational start to this game. Italy's Kiwi No 10 is 17st but he has deft skills on the ball, as he has already demonstrated. The dummy and break from his own 22 showed a daring instinct, his distribution in the lead-up to Sergio Parisse's try was shrewd and his well-weighted kick into England's 22 so nearly sent Andrea Masi away for a second Italian try. Mike Brown has left the field on a stretcher following his collision with Masi. Billy Twelvetrees is on for the Quins man. Jonathan Joseph moves to the wing with Anthony Watson going to full back . Mike Brown did brilliantly to bring down Andrea Masi after the Wasps centre gathered Haimona's brilliant chip, but the Harlequins full back is getting treatment on the ground after an apparent head knock. It's all one-way traffic so far at Twickenham. Italy had a great attacking platform on the England 22 allowing Haimona to release Andrea Masi in midfield.  Giovambattista Venditti, George Biagi and Francesco Minto all carried in the attack before Haimona threaded through a lovely weighted kick which Masi regathered. The Wasps player was brought to ground by Mike Brown but the onrushing Martin Castrogiovanni spilled his offload with the try line begging... Italy are full value for their early lead here. The Azzurri came firing out of the blocks early on with centre Luca Morisi looking dangerous with ball in hand. Kelly Haimona made a lovely half break with a dummy inside his 22 in just one of several Italian phases of possession. Interesting start to this game. Who saw that coming! Great build-up from Italy on the short side and Sergio Parisse throws an audacious dummy and barrels over close to the line. Great start for the visitors. Mike Brown takes the kick-off and takes the tackle. Ben Youngs gets a poor pass away to George Ford who does well to clear his lines. Time for the anthems and then we'll be underway... Ten minutes to kick-off here at Twickenham and it's fair to say that there's a distinct lack of noisy tension around the place. Understandable expectation of a resounding home win, but England will need the home support early on as they attempt to soften up Italy's formidable pack. Rain in the air 15 minutes before kick off at Twickenham. England head in to changing rooms after Italy. Twickenham's otherwise excellent surface will be a little slippery early on. Both sides are out warming up on the Twickenham turf. The sizable figure of Kelly Haimona will be central to Italy's fortunes this afternoon. The Azzurri have struggled to fill the No 10 jersey since Diego Dominguez retired in the early noughties. Jacques Brunel has turned to Kiwi-born powerhouse Haimona for this year's championship. The last time Italy came to Twickenham, England got into a right tussle. Six Toby Flood penalties secured an 18-11 victory against the Azzurri two years ago as Lancaster's side survived an almighty scare. England backs coach Andy Farrell is hoping his side can keep the good times rolling against the Azzurri following their triumph in Cardiff. Farrell said: 'It is important to win your home games — with what we have got coming up this year. All week there has been a feelgood factor within the rugby nation. We want to put on a performance to make sure people come to the ground, enjoy themselves and have the feelgood factor next week. That only comes from a good performance.'

Brown; Watson, Joseph, Burrell, May; Ford, B Youngs; Marler, Hartley, Cole; Attwood, Kruis; Haskell, Robshaw (capt), B Vunipola . Well, England certainly blew the tournament wide open with that stunning display 21-16 victory at the Millennium Stadium on the opening night of the Championship. Stuart Lancaster's side welcome the perennial whipping boys of the Six Nations to Twickenham this afternoon. The Azzurri haven't got the best record against England to put it lightly. These two sides first met in a Test match in 1991. The record reads: England played 20, Won 20. The odds are certainly stacked against Jacques Brunel's side... Lancaster's men go into this contest as overwhelming favourites. Can Italy throw a spanner in the works this afternoon? Stay tuned.","Stuart Lancaster's side secure a 47-17 victory at Twickenham .

"Looking for love: Millions of singletons will be looking for their perfect date online this week with dating websites reporting a surge in users in the period between Christmas and Valentine's Day . It may be the annual onslaught of loved ones questioning your single status over Christmas dinner or the pressure to find that special someone to kiss at midnight on New Year's Eve. But it seems that the post Christmas slump is the time to find romance online with the period between Boxing Day and the turn of the year the busiest stretch for online dating sites. Some websites have reported an increase in traffic as high as 350 per cent with some of the most popular sites bombarding singletons with adverts to convince them that 2013, or even the tail end of 2012, could be their time to be lucky in love. Match.com expects a staggering three million email messages to be sent by users this week with a further 2.5million 'winks' sent and 500,000 instant messaging conversations taking place. Traffic to some of the most popular sites including eHarmony and Match.com has a tendency to peak at the startof January. According to Phillip Hodson, of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy, the reason for the surge in people signing up to dating websites is down to singletons taking stock of their lot at the end of another year. He told the Guardian: 'Christmas tends to be a period of review and revision, partly because it gives you the chance to observe existing models of relationship – the ones that you have, the ones you want to avoid and the ones you want to emulate. 'It is also the winter pause when you review what has been missing in your life and what you want in it, and a period of great loneliness for people who don't fit into the government-approved vision of family. 'Many sense they want a crack at feeling better than they did in the preceding 12 months.' The surge in interest surrounding online dating comes as the UK becomes somewhat less snobby about the way we meet our perfect mate. According to YouGov, one in five relationships in the UK now begins online, and meeting via the internet is the third most popular way to find a date behind 'through friends' or making acquaintance at a pub or bar. Improving standards: Dating websites such as Match.com have met with the ABIA to discuss industry-wide behaviour standards . 'Shopping' mentality: Browsing dating websites online can lead to singletons becoming excessively picky when looking for their perfect partner according to a university study . Nearly half of the UK's singletons are also thought to have dabbled with dating online at some stage too. So it's little wonder that in 2011 dating websites were big business, bringing some £170million to the UK economy - an upsurge of six per cent on the previous year. And the UK is leaps and bounds ahead of its European neighbours when it comes to web dating with 1,500 of the continent's 5,000 dating websites originating in Britain. But it's not all good news for those looking for the perfect partner online - interest wanes significantly when people return to work in the New Year. A study from the University of Rochester in the U.S earlier this year said that dating websites are making people more judgemental. Browsing through profiles on dating websites is said to result in a 'shopping' mentality making people excessively picky according to the study.","Online dating sites are reporting 350 per cent more traffic post Christmas .

"Dennis Rodman has claimed that he is behind the release of one of the US citizens who have been freed after they were detained in North Korea. The former basketball star wrote to his 'friend for life' Kim Jong-Un and begged him for mercy in the case of Kenneth Bae - who had been imprisoned in the hermit kingdom for six months. He was let go along with Matthew Miller and the pair are now reportedly on their way home. In a letter sent to the communist dictator earlier this year that was shown to TMZ, Rodman wrote: '[I] would be eternally grateful for his safe return and make a big step towards bridging the gap between our two nations.' He also compliments the leader's progress, such as the construction of new water parks and airport terminals, in his 'beautiful country' and thanked him for a special stay. Scroll down for video . 'Friend for life': Dennis Rodman has claimed that he is behind the release of one of the US citizens who have been freed after they were detained in North Korea after he reached out to Kim Jong-Un . The former basketball star wrote to his 'friend for life' Kim Jong-Un and begged him for mercy in the case of Kenneth Bae (pictured) - who had been imprisoned in the hermit kingdom for six months . Diplomacy: In a letter sent to the communist dictator earlier, Rodman wrote: '[I] would be eternally grateful for his safe return and make a big step towards bridging the gap between our two nations.' The note continues: 'I understand the crimes he committeed and ask you my dear friend, the highly respected Marshall Kim Jong Un for his release to show my country how loving and compassionate you and the DPRK can be.' Rodman told the site he sent the letter and January and believes his trips to the communist country influenced the developments. He visited North Korea three times last year, in February, March and December, but he said he had been threatened with sanctions by Washington if he continued his activities in the country. In the past, the former NBA player, how famous for his piercings and tattoos has been accused of being duped by Pyongyang and pandering to the North Korean leader, singing 'Happy Birthday' to Kim at an exhibition basketball game and dismissing evidence of rampant rights abuses and repression. But he insisted Kim wants to hold discussions with President Barack Obama and has told him the North has nuclear weapons because it is a small country that has to defend itself. Travel: Rodman visited North Korea three times last year, in February, March and December, but he said he had been threatened with sanctions by Washington if he continued his activities in the country . A spokesman for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he was accompanying Americans Bae and Miller on their journey back to the United States. Bae and Miller were the last Americans held by North Korea following the release last month of Jeffrey Fowle, an Ohio resident detained for nearly six months. Miller, who's from Bakersfield, California, was serving a six-year jail term on charges of espionage, after he allegedly ripped his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport in April and demanded asylum. North Korea said Miller had wanted to experience prison life so that he could secretly investigate North Korea's human rights situation. Bae, who's from Lynnwood, Washington, is a Korean-American missionary with health problems. He was serving a 15-year sentence for alleged anti-government activities. He was detained in 2012 while leading a tour group to a North Korea economic zone. His delighted son, Jonathan, told Reuters from Arizona that he received a call Friday night and spoke to his father. 'The brief time on the phone, he sounded good,' Jonathan said. 'I'm sure he will be back to his old self in no time. 'It came out of the blue. One minute he was doing farm labor and the next minute they are saying, 'You are going home.' Just like everyone else, he was surprised.' Fowle had been detained after leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the hope that it would reach the country's underground Christian community. The announcement about Bae and Miller came one day before Obama travels to Asia for a three-country visit. He said today that it was a 'wonderful day for them and their families' and was 'grateful' the pair had been returned. Fowle, who was detained after he put a bible in a nightclub, told CNN the pair should have been released before he was, but was happy they were now home. He also admitted that ghe only realized he wasn't being freed with them when he got on the plane. Gordon Chang, the author of Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World, told Fox that the release of three detainees within the space of a month could indicate a changing Philosophy in Pyongyang. U.S. officials did not immediately provide other details about the circumstances of the Americans' release or when they would return home. Administration officials said the timing of the release was not related to President Barack Obama's imminent trip to China, Myanmar and Australia. The Korean-American who has health problems was detained in 2012 while leading a tour group to a North Korea economic zone . Clapper traveled to North Korea as a presidential envoy, officials said, and apparently is the highest-ranking administration official to visit Pyongyang. Obama said he Clapper was 'doing a great job on what was obviously a challenging mission.' The development does not mean a change in U.S. posture regarding North Korea's disputed nuclear program, and the North still must show it is serious and ready to abide by commitments toward denuclearization and improved human rights, said a senior Obama administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters. The official said there was no quid pro quo involved in the Americans' release. The U.S. notified allies of Clapper's trip to North Korea and alerted members of the congressional leadership once his visit was underway, the official said. The State Department issued a statement thanking Sweden for its part in the release of Bae and Miller. Sweden serves as a diplomatic intermediary for the United States in North Korea because Washington has no diplomatic ties with Pyongyang. North Korea has been on a diplomatic campaign to counter charges by a U.N. body that highlighted widespread human rights abuses and a move by some U.N. members to refer the state to an international tribunal. 'North Korean policy continues to zig-zag,' said Stephan Haggard, a North Korea expert at the University of California in San Diego. 'After pursuing a charm offensive aimed at restarting North-South talks and even a human rights dialogue, North Korea shut those initiatives down following the tabling of a strongly worded human rights resolution at the U.N. General Assembly. But the release of Miller and Bae suggests an effort to keep channels for dialogue open.'

"The admirable show of respect between players when they swap shirts is usually reserved for the end of a match, not half-time. But during the break between Chelsea and Liverpool on Sunday, a few of the players saw fit to get in early and bag themselves their opponents' shirts with 45 minutes left on the clock. After referee Howard Webb blew his whistle for half-time in Chelsea's thrilling win at Stamford Bridge, France and Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho and Chelsea star Samuel Eto'o swapped shirts while making their way down off the pitch. Really? Samuel Eto'o (left) and Mamadou Sakho (right) change shirts at half-time at Stamford Bridge . And they weren't the only ones. Sky Sports cameras also picked up fellow Brazilians Coutinho and Oscar prematurely exchanging their jerseys too. The peculiar act sparked outrage from supporters of both clubs on Twitter. One user posted: 'Here's @LFC player Sakho asking for the shirt of the man who just scored against him.' And another wrote: 'Note to Mourinho and Rodgers... get Eto'o and Sakho off the field right now for that ridiculous half-time shirt swap' Spotted: Coutinho and Oscar (circled) were also prematurely swapping their jerseys . Early on: Chelsea's Eto'o and Sakho of Liverpool had a further 45 minutes on the clock . But the players' bizarre move to swap shirts before the final whistle isn't the first time it's happened. Former Arsenal defender Andre Santos provoked outrage from fans when he approached ex-Gunner Robin van Persie for a half-time swap in the Dutchman's first game against his former club after joining Manchester United. The Brazilian defender didn't endear himself to the travelling Arsenal fans after a torrid half at Old Trafford that saw Van Persie net after just three minutes for United. Robinho, of AC Milan, and fellow Brazilian Neymar also swapped at the break during the Champions League clash between the Italian side and Barcelona earlier this season.

"Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said it would not be 'appropriate' to publish list of names . IRA suspects who were sent official letters telling them they were not wanted by the authorities cannot be named because of their ‘human rights’, a minister declared last night. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said she had seen the list of names but it would not be ‘appropriate’ or ‘helpful’ to publish it because it could breach their right to life and their right to privacy under the Human Rights Act. In a statement to MPs, Miss Villiers said anyone who received a letter could still face prosecution and possession of one did not amount to a ‘get out of jail free card’. The existence of the letters, which were sent to nearly 200 IRA suspects after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, only emerged last year after a failed prosecution. Police arrested John Downey, 62, from Donegal as he passed through Gatwick Airport last year over the 1982 Hyde Park bombing in which four British soldiers were murdered. But the case was thrown out by a senior judge after Mr Downey revealed the existence of a ‘comfort’ letter sent to him, by mistake, despite an outstanding warrant against him from the Metropolitan Police. Miss Villiers made her statement in an effort to make clear the letters could not be relied upon. She said: ‘No one should take any comfort from these letters, no one should rely on them.’ ‘To all those who have a letter I say, if the police or prosecuting authorities have evidence which is available today or becomes available in the future to pursue you, they can and will pursue you.’ She said decisions by prosecutors and the police would not be influenced by the letters and a suspect could be prosecuted if there was enough evidence against them. She also said publishing the list could undermine any future prosecution. But her refusal to name those on the list of suspects enraged Unionist MPs on the Northern Ireland Committee, who asked what message it would send to victims of unsolved terror attacks. But Lady Sylvia Hermon MP, of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, criticised her decision, saying that not revealing the names gave little comfort to the victims of the IRA. Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley demanded to know if there was a specific security threat against anyone on the list and suggested senior Sinn Fein leaders such as Gerry Adams could have been sent a letter. John Downey, 62, was arrested last year over the 1982 Hyde Park bombing. The case was thrown out after he revealed the existence of a ‘comfort’ letter sent to him, by mistake, despite an outstanding warrant against him . In July, a judge-led review of the scheme found that it was systematically flawed in operation but not unlawful in principle. The ‘on the runs’ scheme saw names of individuals passed to the Government, mostly through Sinn Fein. Anyone found to not be wanted was given a letter of assurance.","Theresa Villiers said it would not be 'appropriate' to publish list of names .

"Fight: Vladimir Putin's bodyguards were involved in a punch-up at the BRICS summit in South Africa . Armed guards from Vladimir Putin's entourage were involved in an ugly fight in South Africa after they were ordered to put top secret suitcases - believed to contain the codes for Russia's nuclear arsenal - through a security scanner. The nightmare scenes came as the Kremlin leader arrived in Durban on an official trip to attend the 'BRICS' summit. Angry 'pushing and shoving' broke out after some members of Putin's security detail were prevented from following the Russian president into the conference hall staging the summit, which was hosted by South Africa's president Jacob Zuma and also involved Brazil, Russia, India and China. 'Putin managed to go through their lines, but his closest security detail were ordered to put their small suitcases on the belt to X-ray check them,' Moskovsky Komsomolets revealed. These were the 'very particular suitcases, secret ones, which are always carried right behind the president's back and the guards never let go even for a second,' the newspaper added.

"A 17-year old boy who was on his way home from high School graduation was shot and killed in what appeared to be a random shooting spree in Norfolk, Virginia that later prompted death of a police officer and the suspected shooter. Mark Rodriguez, 17, was shot by at least one bullet as he sat inside his vehicle at 11 p.m. on Friday after shooter James Brown, 29, started shooting from his Jeep on Chesapeake Boulevard in a 'random' spree. Officers the located Brown's home at the 7400 block of Wellington Road after recognizing his vehicle. 17-year-old Mark Rodriguez was shot and killed on his way home from his high school graduation . Officer Brian Jones, 35, was shot and killed by the suspected shooter in a shooting spree and police chase on Friday night . Suspected shooter James Brown, 29, was shot and killed by officers after allegedly shooting 17-year-old Mark Rodriguez and police officer Brian Jones . ABC 13 reports that once Brown saw officers outside his home he began shooting at them from the doorway with a high powered rifle. Brown shot both Officer Brian Jones, 35, and Officer Curtis Allison, 28, fatally wounding Jones. Police Chief Micheal Goldsmith reported that Jones was shot multiple times by Brown and Allison was shot as he attempted to help Jones. Both officers were rushed to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital for gunshot wounds. Jones died at the hospital but Allison is expected to make a full recovery. After shooting the cops, Brown sped into his driveway as his neighbors including Steve Koptchak and Roberta Howe witnessed him drive off after hearing several gunshots. 'It was instantaneous,' Koptchak told ABC 13. Investigators walk away from the scene of a shooting on Wellington Road in Norfolk, Virgina on Saturday .

'As soon as the dude stopped the vehicle, gunfire started raining down,' he said. 'There was probably 30 to 40 gunshots, there was an awful lot of gunshots.' As officers drove to the scene to assist Jones, another officer chased Brown as he drove down east Little Creek Road. Brown hit a car on the road to the car's owner Tiffany Bottoms' dismay. 'I got up, jumped up, went outside and I looked and I seen the red car-- I didn't notice my car was way back there,' she said Saturday to ABC 13. 'I started screaming 'My car! My car! My car!' she said. Brown fled the vehicle with his gun. An officer then tried to arrest Brown who tried to fight back and disarm the officer. Brown was eventually shot and killed during a battle with police officers. 'The police officer tried to subdue the suspect but the suspect went for his weapon,' witness Nick Ortiz said. Ortiz was home with his wife and kids when he heard the car crash and went outside to see what was happening. Officer Curtis Allison, 28, was also shot by brown but is expected to survive and recover fully . Mark Rodriguez, 17, 'was in the wrong place at the wrong time' when he was shot directly following his High School graduation .

In 2012 he was convicted of carrying a loaded gun and spent one year in prison. The head of Norfolk Christian Schools said that grief counselors would be available on Sunday to talk to anyone who is suffering. 'I have been praying, weeping and trying to process this information for hours,' wrote Pat McCarty, the head of Norfolk Christian Schools in a statement following the shooting.

"The QE2 is to return to the seas after a troubled five-year stay in Dubai. The former pride of the Cunard Line and Falklands War veteran was bought by Dubai for $100 million and arrived there amid much fanfare in November 2008. There were ambitious plans to convert her into a luxury hotel docked at the Palm Jumeirah, a tree-shaped artificial island that was a symbol of Dubai’s helter-skelter development. Back to the seas: The QE2 is to set sail again after a troubled five-year stay in Dubai . However the project was cancelled amid the financial meltdown that saw property prices in the Gulf city plummet. The iconic liner’s voyage from her home port of Southampton to Dubai in 2008 was expected to be her last ever. Today, however, it was announced in Dubai that she will take to the waves once more. On October 18 she will be given a gala send-off as she departs for China, stopping off at Singapore and Hong Kong on the way. The liner, which was built on the Clyde and launched in 1967, will be converted at a Chinese shipyard into a luxury 400-suite floating hotel at a cost of US$90 million. Historic: An aerial view of the QE2 pulling into Southampton harbour after the Falklands War . The work is expected to be completed by the end of 2014, and she will then travel to her final destination, a yet-to-be-named city in Asia. The vessel has been readied for the voyage at Dubai’s drydocks, where seven of her nine engines have been renewed. A captain and crew have been recruited, and the liner will sail under the flag of Vanuatu, the Pacific island nation where she is registered. Ownership of the ship has been transferred to a new Dubai company called QE2 Shipping. Chairman Khamis Juma Buamim said: “Over the last few months we have put a lot of effort and work into this project in planning and negotiation and our overall plans for the QE2 are well on track.'We will deliver an iconic project for the world to romance and talk about for many many years to come.' The world’s best-loved liner criss-crossed the Atlantic with the biggest celebrities of the day on board for nearly 40 years, and in 1982 carried 3,000 troops to the Falklands. However she has been in the doldrums since the scrapping of the Dubai hotel project. She had been bought by Dubai World, the conglomerate behind the Palm islands and other mega-projects that has since been engulfed in debt. Initial plans: The QE2 was going to become a luxury hotel docked at the Palm Jumeirah, a tree-shaped artificial island, but it was cancelled when Dubai's economy nose-dived . A ceremony was held on deck to mark the purchase, and Sultan bin Sulayem, the then-chairman of Dubai World, said: 'The QE2 has come to a home that will cherish and protect her. Her future has been assured.' However there was outcry in Britain when it was reported that plans to refurbish the vessel would involve destroying its distinctive outline by removing its funnel. After the scheme was scrapped a number of other proposals came to nothing. There were reports that she would sail to Cape Town to serve as a floating hotel during the 2010 World Cup, and rumours that Dubai would sell her back to Britain. Last December it was reported that she was being sold to China for scrap. The reports were denied, and the plans to convert her into a hotel to be based in Asia were revealed. Yesterday’s announcement that the QE2 is to leave Dubai appeared to confirm that she is about to enter a new era.","It was built in Scotland in 1967 but sold to Dubai in 2008 for £70million .

"Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson is looking beyond the potential psychological blow his side could land on relegation rivals Aston Villa in the FA Cup this weekend. The Foxes travel to Villa Park on Sunday for a fifth-round tie between two sides that are not only struggling in the Barclays Premier League but enduring turbulent times off the field. Pearson has had a dismal week, with his bottom-placed side losing to Crystal Palace and Arsenal to remain five points adrift of safety. But that is only part of a story which has also included a bizarre touchline altercation with Palace midfielder James McArthur and seen widespread reports that he had been sacked, only for the club to deny them. Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson wants an FA Cup victory over Aston Villa to help boost his side's form . Leicester are currently 20th in the Premier League table with just just 17 points from 25 games . Yet, if anything, the turmoil at Villa has eclipsed even that at the King Power Stadium, with fans' protests culminating in the sacking of manager Paul Lambert in midweek. That could give the Foxes the chance to boost their morale and further deflate Villa's, but Pearson is not thinking about the potential impact of victory on the opposition. 'You could argue that but it is not something that is at the forefront of my thinking,' he said. 'My thinking is about our players, getting the team right, getting the performance right and hopefully getting the result we want to get into the next round. 'When you are not winning in the league, the cup competitions give you an opportunity to win games and hopefully build confidence. 'I don't have a great deal of control over what goes on outside of the football club but I will be working very hard to make sure we go into this game as prepared as we can be, bearing in mind the speculation that has surrounded myself, our club and now our opponents.' Aston Villa parted company with their manager Paul Lambert after the club dropped into the relegation zone . Villa lost 2-0 to Hull City last time out and have not won a Premier League game since December last year . Aston Villa supporters reveal a 'Lambert Out' banner at the KC Stadium on February 10 . Villa have scored just two goals in their last 10 Premier Leagues and are currently 18th in the table . On paper, Leicester's form is only marginally better than Villa's. Pearson's men have lost four of their last five games with the only positive result in that sequence being their fourth-round win over Tottenham. Villa have lost five from six, their fourth-round success against Bournemouth the one bright note. But while Villa's play - and most notably their lack of goals - has been heavily criticised, Leicester have at least earned some plaudits for their positive attitude. Pearson said: 'Anybody who has seen us play recently could not suggest the players lack confidence. We have continued to play with a positive intent, and that is always going to be important. 'We still have enough games for it (our Premier League situation) to be in our hands. The players have a responsibility to go out there and perform. 'Nice things have been said about our performances but it is very much a results business. This is about us trying to get a positive result in this game. That would help us in preparation for the next Premier League game.' Leicester will have to make at least one change for the tie with on-loan defender Robert Huth cup-tied after playing in the third round with Stoke. Despite their precarious league position, Leicester have been praised for the attacking football they play .

"The body of an American woman in her 20s traveling alone in Thailand and missing for five days was found over the weekend in a national park, apparently trampled by elephants. Lily Glidden's body was so badly damaged that authorities immediately came to the startling conclusion after finding her January 18 following a manhunt that brought in 70 people. She was found in Kaeng Krachan National Park, a preserve famous for its elephants, and authorities believe she was photographing them when she was killed. Crushed: Lily Glidden was found crumpled in the woods of Thailand's Kaeng Krachan National Park January 18 (elephants in the park pictured). Authorities revealed today that the American tourist was trampled by wild elephants . Remote: Kaeng Krachan is Thailand's largest national forest and is well known for its elephants but attacks are rare . Park rangers announced Thursday they'd found the body in the park outside Bangkok. Glidden was found crumpled in the woods after the search team was deployed. 'Her arms, her wrists and other parts of the body were broken, so we assumed she was trampled by elephants because no humans could have caused such powerful damage to the body,' said police Col. Woradet Suanklaai. Police sent the body to a forensic institute in the capital to determine the cause of death, he said. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok confirmed the death, but gave no details. Tragic: Kaeng Krachan is world famous for its wild Asian elephants. Authorities say Glidden, who was traveling alone, was taking photos of them when she was killed . Kaeng Krachan is the largest national park in Thailand, covering nearly 32,300 square feet of forest. It is 124 miles southwest of Bangkok.

"A primary school has raised the bar for its pupils – quite literally. Metal bars have been fitted to desks to stop the children getting too close to their books and becoming short-sighted. In the position pictured below, the bars prevent youngsters from leaning too closely over their exercise books as they write. This primary school in China has installed bars on to all students' desks to help them read at a safe distance . The school, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, said the bars will prevent children from 'damaging their eyes' The bar can also be pushed forwards . away from the child who can then rest a book against it at the . appropriate distance for reading. The . idea is being tried at a school in China. Long hours in class and a . lack of outdoor play are blamed for an ‘epidemic’ among China’s . youngsters of short-sightedness, where distant objects appear blurred . while near ones are clear. Teachers at Zhang Lin Elementary in Wuhan, central China, said the bars . will help children develop good reading habits and prevent them from . damaging their eyes. Constant close work may contribute to short-sightedness, so holding books at a distance could keep it at bay. Some . 41 per cent of primary school children in China now need glasses, and . by the time they leave school, up to 90 per cent will be short-sighted. In . contrast, around one in three Britons is short-sighted although this is . on the rise as we too spend more time indoors and looking closely at . computer and TV screens. Ren . Weibing, who advises Chinese parents on how to avoid problems with . their children’s eyesight, said: ‘When I was in primary school in the . 1970s, no one wore glasses. Headmaster Zhang Jianming said the bars were installed by the City Teen Anti-Myopia Office . The bars can be used both for resting the books on as well as keeping childrens' eyes a safe distance from their books . ‘But . we did not have televisions or computers and we spent our time playing . outside. Today, children spend a prolonged amount of time staring at . things at close distance. ‘Parents . are unaware of the serious consequences of poor eyesight and only care . about good results for their children at school.’ Australian . scientist Professor Ian Morgan, who published on the topic in the . Lancet, said that while long hours on schoolwork puts pressure on the . eyes, exposure to daylight can be protective. It is thought it triggers the release of chemicals that prevent the distortion of the eyeball behind short-sightedness. He added that the daytime naps common in South East Asian schools deprive children of primetime exposure to light. Headmaster Zhang Jianming, of the Zhang Lin Elementary School, said the bars were installed by the City Teen Anti-Myopia Office. He explained that they will be used to help children develop good reading habits. The bars can be moved up and down to stop students moving their heads too close to the books. The bars can also be pushed back to the distance at which children should be holding their books.","Primary school in Hubei Province has put the bars on to all students' desks .

"The NFL's decision to ban rifle maker Daniel Defense from airing a commercial during Superbowl XLVIII has led to protests from America's gun lobby. In the clip, a former marine speaks about protecting his family in their quaint, suburban home. He pulls into the driveway and then stops on the front walk, briefly scanning the neighborhood for snipers and suicide bombers. Banned: The Daniel Defense advert shows a family safe and well in their suburban home . 'No one has the right to tell me how to defend them,' he says of his wife and baby. The company's logo then flashes on the screen - a silhouette of 'the most effective tool for the job', an AR15 assault rifle. The ad was banned last month for flouting the NFL's gun rule which state: 'Firearms, ammunition or other weapons are prohibited; however, stores . that sell firearms and ammunitions (e.g., outdoor stores and camping . stores) will be permitted, provided they sell other products and the ads . do not mention firearms, ammunition or other weapons.' Following the NFL's ruling, Daniel Defense offered to replace the company's logo with an American flag and/or the words 'Shall not be infringed'.

The Superbowl will be played in New Jersey between the Denver Broncos, whose quarterback Peyton Manning is pictured here (left), and the Seattle Seahawks .

Americans watched the Green Bay Packers beat Pittsburgh Steelers, and . many paid close attention to the dozens of commercials aired during game . breaks. Stephen Master, head of sports for Nielsen, which tracks viewership, said: 'There's nothing to compare it to. Maybe the Oscars or some of the music (awards) shows, but not really.' The company was willing to replace the gun with an American flag or the words 'Shall Not Be Infringed'. But the NFL wouldn't budge. In an interview on Fox and Friends, Daniel Defense CEO Marty Daniel said: 'We actually went to the rule box and pulled out their set of rules and got a big no.' Petitions in support of the ad have followed - such as one titled 'Allow Daniel Defense to show their SuperBowl commercial supporting Freedom!' - along with cries of support on the company's Facebook page. One poster, Shawn Butt, said: 'Alcohol and automobiles are both responsible for more deaths than firearms. But the NFL doesn't seem to have a problem with either of those.' A YouTube video in response to the ban complaining that the NFL has become 'politicized' now boasts more than two million views - far more than the original commercial.

"Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has come under fire after an undercover video emerged exposing 'shocking cruelty' at a foie gras factory which supplies one of his licensed restaurants. Animal rights groups People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) are accusing the star of having double standards after filming thousands of ducks being force-fed through steel tubes. In 2011, Ramsay made a documentary in which he condemned the slaughter of sharks to make shark fin soup. On the Channel 4 film Shark Bait, he described the cruelty of the industry as 'sick' and 'barbaric' and encouraged viewers not to buy the dish. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO (GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING) Gordon .

Gordon Ramsay at The London, New York . But PETA have revealed how Hudson Valley Foie Gras appears on the 'Menu Prestige' at New York restaurant Gordon Ramsay at The London. The group have released undercover footage from the farm which shows steel tubes being forced down ducks throats to fill them with large amounts of grain three times a day. The Manhattan fine dining venue was sold by Ramsay to the Blackstone Group in 2009, but it continues to operate under the chef's name and he acts as a consultant. A traditional French delicacy, foie gras is made from the liver of a duck or goose which has been specifically fattened and has a rich and buttery taste. image001.png . In the footage factory workers can be seen inserting steel tubes into ducks mouths before force-feeding them large amounts of grain . Experts say force-feeding ducks causes oesophageal tears and splits, liver rupture and failure, heat stress and aspiration pneumonia .

At slaughter the ducks are hung upside down, have their throats slit and are left to bleed to death. An estimated 15,000 ducks per year die at the Hudson Valley Foie Gras factory before they even make it to slaughter. PETA claim experts probing foie gras production have found that force-feeding causes oesophageal tears and splits, liver rupture and failure, heat stress and aspiration pneumonia. Mimi Bekhechi, from PETA UK, said: . 'Every expose of foie gras farms has revealed how grotesquely cruel it . is to jam pipes down birds' throats and force-feed them until they . sicken and die. 'We hope Gordon Ramsay and other chefs will swear off this particular 'f-word' - foie gras - for good.' The group has written a letter to Ramsay urging him to take foie gras off the menu. B42RM4 Foie gras . Ramsay got his first taste for catering at the North Oxfordshire Technical College where he studied Hotel Management. In the early 1980s, he worked as a commis chef at the Wroxton House Hotel then ran the kitchen and 60-seat dining room at the Wickham Arms. He then moved to London, where he worked for Marco Pierre White at Harvey's for two years . After working at Harveys for nearly three years he switched to work for  Albert Roux at Le Gavroche in Mayfair before working as his number two at Hotel Diva, a ski resort in the French Alps. From there, Ramsay moved to Paris to work with Guy Savoy and Joël Robuchon, both Michelin-starred chefs. Returning to London in 1993, he took head chef role at La Tante Claire in Chelsea before working in the same capacity for  Marco Pierre White at the Aubergine which went on to win its first Michelin star fourteen months later. In 1997, . In 1998, Ramsay opened his own restaurant in Chelsea, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, with the help of his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson. From here he expanded rapidly his empire from London to Glasgow, Dubai, Tokyo and New York. It has, however, been a difficult few years for the chef . He reportedly paid his father-in-law £2million to end a long-running row over his business in 2012.The pair went their separate way after Ramsay accused Chris Hutcheson of taking money out of parent company Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH). He was even seen in an awkward QVC pitch, as he tried to sell the 'Nonstick Hard Anodized Dishwasher Safe 10-piece Cookware Set'. Ramsay's fiscal situation hasn't been as healthy as it once was in the last few years, after he paid off a a tax debt in 2009 relating to his Plane Food restaurant at Heathrow’s Terminal 5.Gordon Ramsay sold his restaurant in Prague - Maze at the Hilton in Prague's Old Town - back to the hotel in 2009 . Also in 2009, he sold his restaurant in Prague – Maze at the Hilton in Prague’s Old Town – back to the hotel. The father-of-four closed two eateries in Australia in 2011, waving goodbye to Maze and Maze Grill in Melbourne’s Crown Metropol Hotel. Further troubles include a £1.1million court battle in New Zealand after pulling out of a number of charity engagements, citing personal reasons . A representative of Hudson Valley Foie Gras said: 'The PETA film is from a tour I gave. I see myself in the video. We do this to provide the total picture of what we do for interested people. 'We do not film the slaughter for our film as it is basically the same as every other poultry processing plant in the world, although we do show visitors. That is the way poultry is processed. The clip does not show the birds being gently handled and put to sleep before the slaughter. 'We invite people to take pictures on the tours. Other people have posted these videos of fragments from the tours. We will continue to bring people to the farm so they can see the whole truth.' Gordon Ramsay's representatives failed to respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Gordon Ramsay at The London said: 'We do not in anyway condone cruelty to animals. We strive to provide our guests with the finest quality ingredients and we seek to work with purveyors who are able to deliver on that promise. 'We are amongst a number of New York City restaurants that provide this delicacy based on the discerning tastes and desire of our diners.'

"A railway passenger was left stunned after she needed a staggering 14 tickets just for a simple return train trip. Project manager Rachel Woodward, 28, booked the easy journey from Leeds to Leicester online, only to be bamboozled by a huge pile of paperwork. When she arrived at the station she was shocked and confused when the machine spewed out 14 separate tickets for the £16.50 trip - plus a receipt. Confused: Rachel Woodward and her bike needed more than a dozen separate tickets just to travel 200 miles by train . Barmy: Rachel holds the wad of 14 tickets  - which cost her £16.50 - and a receipt that flowed endlessly out of the machine . The pile included two tickets for herself, four seat reservations, four tickets for her bike as well as four further bike reservations. This stack of tickets was needed to cover Rachel changing trains at Sheffield and for her return journey home. Ms Woodward has said the amount of tickets was 'confusing' as she did not know which one to show at the barrier or show the guard on board the train. And now the Association of Train Companies say they are looking at reducing the amount of tickets passengers need as a result. The 28-year-old, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'When I was at the machine the tickets would just not stop coming out. Odd: The passenger, 28, only needed to travel from Leeds station, pictured above, to Leicester station, below,  but it was complicated by a mammoth pile of paperwork .

'I think it’s also really wasteful, especially at a time when people are becoming more conscious of the environment. 'I don’t see why we can’t have an Oyster card like in London or a bit of paper with a barcode on it.' Fourteen-ticket journey: Return trip  from Leeds to Leicester and back was 200 miles . A spokesperson for the Association of Train Operating Companies said: 'Train companies have been involved for some time now in a series of projects to improve the information they provide to passengers including a redesign of tickets to make them easier to understand.

"The polygamous king of Swaziland has kicked his twelfth wife out of his royal palace following claims she cheated on him with one of his friends, it was reported today (sun). Officials working for King Mswati III, 43, ordered Nothando Dube, 23, to vacate her official residence last week, according to a report in South Africa's Sunday Times. The eviction comes after the Queen, the twelfth of the monarch's 14 current wives, claimed she was being held as a prisoner in the palace following allegations made last year that she had cheated on her husband with the country's justice minister. Shunned: King Mswati III has ordered his 12th wife to leave the royal residence over allegations she was unfaithful . The Sunday Times today reported how the dispute came to a head when Mrs Dube tried to leave her residence to visit a hospital after one of her children injured herself while playing. The Queen claimed she was physically prevented from leaving the royal palace by a security guard whom she later attacked with pepper spray. She told the newspaper: 'He threatened to hit me, saying I am not going anywhere with my child, who was bleeding from a deep wound. 'I had to protect myself so I sprayed him in the eyes.' The violent altercation happened on November 12 at the secluded palace where Mrs Dube claims she had been held prisoner for more than a year. The wife has previously spoken about how she had been prevented from seeing her husband since it was claimed last August that she had been caught having an affair. King Mswati, Africa's last remaining . absolute monarch, was said to be furious after the mother of three of . his children was found in bed with Ndumiso Mamba, his close friend and . the country's then justice minister. Evicted: Nothando Dube claims that she was banned from leaving the palace or seeing her husband as punishment for the alleged betrayal . Queen Dube was placed under house arrest and Mr Mamba was sacked from the cabinet following the scandal, which was made public after pictures emerged of the bashful minister hiding in the base of her royal bed. Since then, the wife had been held at the royal palace where she was allegedly banned from leaving or seeing her husband as punishment for the betrayal. But Mrs Dube, a former Miss Swaziland who married the king when she was 16, was finally forced to leave the royal household following last week's row. The Sunday Times reported that the matter was reported to the landlocked southern African state's Queen Mother, who decided she had been disrespectful by attacking the guard and should be kicked out. The Queen told the newspaper her children remained at the palace following her eviction. She said: 'I couldn't even take all my stuff, because they just said 'you have to pack and leave now'. The Queen's sudden departure from the royal household has been condemned by human rights campaigners. Lucky Lukhele, spokesman for the Swaziland Solidarity Network, criticised the king for LaDube's 'brutal eviction'. Under Swazi tradition the monarch goes into 'seclusion' away from public view each spring before a ceremony to mark the first fruits of the year. Mr Lukhele said royal sources claimed he had informed his mother he wanted his twelfth wife to have been removed this year by the time he returned. Ceremony: The king in traditional dress for the annual Reed Dance at Ludzidzini, Swaziland in August last year . Mr Kuhele, whose campaigning organisation is based in neighbouring South Africa, said: 'The ill-treatment that Mrs Dube has endured and the subsequent separation from her children is a very inhumane act' Last week's eviction is reportedly the third time a Swazi queen has been forced to leave the royal household since 2004. King Mswati is known to have at least 14 current wives and scores of children. Under Swazi tradition the polygamous monarch is permitted to choose a new bride each year from a selection of the country's prettiest virgins who dance topless for him at the annual 'Reed Dance' festival. His wives are each given homes within the king's string of official residences located around the tiny landlocked kingdom, which lies between South Africa and Mozambique. However the royal family's lavish lifestyle has come under fire in recent months from campaigners who have demanded democracy in Swaziland. King Mswati currently rules his 1.2 million subjects through informal discussion with the country's cabinet, whom he appoints himself. But this year the authorities have been forced to quell a string of protest against his autocratic rule. The monarch, who was educated at Britain's Sherborne School, has repeatedly refused to consider reform. Political opposition parties in the country are banned and activists are routinely arrested or assaulted. Despite the criticism of his rule, Mswati enjoys backing from neighbouring South Africa, who recently propped up the economy of its junior neighbour with a POUNDS 215m loan. Swaziland is a former British protectorate which gained independence in 1968. The vast majority of its citizens live in poverty. The population has also been ravaged by Aids and has one of the highest rates of infection in the world. Some studies have suggested that up to 40 percent of the population could be living with the disease.","Queen allegedly cheated on her husband with the country's justice minister .

"LG has launched its eagerly awaited 55ins television which, thanks to OLED technology, promise startlingly clear images on screens just 4mm thick. The set - the first big screen OLED on the market - heralds the arrival of a new technology which is set to take over our living rooms. The South Korean company said the TVs have a price tag of 11million won (£6,363), and will be delivered to buyers in its home market next month. Scroll down for video . World first: South Korean tech giant LG is the first to offer a big-screen TV using OLED technology. Organic light-emitting diodes promise images with enhanced clarity, deeper colour saturation and sharper contrast . They will be available in North America, Europe and the rest of Asia before the end of March. While LG becomes the world's first company to bring a big-screen next-generation TV to market, it's far from clear whether the bet will pay off. Manufacturing the sets is difficult . and expensive, while incremental increases in image quality offer . diminishing returns to consumers and the company is beset by cut-throat . competition from rivals. TVs . using OLEDs - organic light-emitting diodes - offer images with . enhanced clarity, deeper colour saturation and sharper contrast than . standard liquid crystal display TVs. Wafer thin: Thanks to the OLED technology, the new 55in television has a screen that is just 4mm thick . The advanced, energy-efficient display technology makes it possible to manufacture thinner televisions, with LG's model measuring up at just 4mm thick. LG's announcement is the culmination of a race by electronics makers to be the first to deliver the next-generation sets. Sony showed up the world's first 11in OLED TV set in 2007, but the Japanese company failed to follow up with a bigger display. While OLED panels are more widely used in mobile screens, mass producing large panels is still tough because of technological challenges. Jang Moon-ik, director of LG's TV business, said in an interview last year that only two companies in the world have a capacity to mass produce large screen OLED TVs: LG and rival South Korean company Samsung Electronics. Even though LG and Samsung touted OLEDs as the future of television, both failed to deliver them to the market as promised in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to manufacturing challenges. Samsung declined to comment on the availability of its OLED TVs, saying making perfect products is more important than the launch schedule. Grabbing the title of the first OLED TV maker is much more symbolic than practical because initial production numbers will likely be small. Manufacturing big-screen new TVs requires billions in investments to upgrade factories. South Korean TV makers nevertheless hope their cutting-edge display technology can help offset falling prices and make their products stand out from those of their fast-growing Chinese rivals. Japanese companies, which previously dominated the global TV market, are struggling to come up with their own next-generation TV sets to avoid falling further behind but don't have enough cash to invest in new technology.","Organic light-emitting diodes promise thinner screens  and clearer images .

Conditions came under scrutiny in the 1940s due to an outbreak of dysentery that resulted from unsanitary living conditions in the wards. By 1974 the hospital had spiraled completely out of control and an investigation was prompted after a series of crimes including rapes, assaults, a riot and attempted murder. One of its more notorious patients was former NYPD officer Robert Torsney, who was committed there from December, 1977-June, 1979 after being found not guilty by insanity in the 1976 murder of then 15-year-old Randolph Evans in Brooklyn. Creedmoor continues to operate today, but housing only a few hundred patients as advancements in treatment for the mentally ill have proved a much more effective way of dealing.

"In its prime, a massive steam locomotive known as Big Boy No. 4014 was a moving eruption of smoke and vapor, a 6,300-horsepower brute dragging heavy freight trains over the mountains of Wyoming and Utah. It's been silent for half a century, pushed aside by more efficient diesels, but now it's coming back to life. The Union Pacific Railroad is embarking on a yearslong restoration project that will put No. 4014 back to work pulling special excursion trains. 'It's sort of like going and finding the Titanic or something that's just very elusive, nothing that we ever thought would happen,' said Jim Wrinn, editor of Trains, a magazine that covers the railroad industry. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Spectators take pictures of the historic locomotive, Union Pacific Big Boy No. 4014 at Metrolink Station in Covina, California . Powerhouse: Big Boy No. 4014 was a moving eruption of smoke and vapor . Miguel Angel Warner, right, four, of Los Angeles, asks Ed Dickens Jr., senior manager of heritage operations for the Union Pacific Railroad, about the historic locomotive . 'Something that's so large and powerful and magnificent, we didn't think any of them would ever come back,' he said. The American Locomotive Co. in Schenectady, N.Y., built 25 of the monsters to Union Pacific's specifications between 1941 and 1944, and they became legendary. They were the largest steam locomotives ever to work the rugged terrain of the American West, and by most standards the largest anywhere in the world, said Gordon McCulloh, a meticulous historian of Union Pacific steam power. Even the name is legendary. An unknown worker scrawled 'Big Boy' on the front of one of the engines when it was under construction. 'It came out one day, and it had ""Big Boy"" in chalk on it. And from that day forward, it was Big Boy,' said Ed Dickens Jr., Union Pacific's senior manager of heritage operations, who will oversee the restoration at the railroad's steam shop in Cheyenne, Wyo. Dickens and his crew recreated the chalk inscription on No. 4014 when they began to move it. Big Boys are 132 feet long, including the tender, which carried coal and water. They weigh 1.2 million pounds with a full load of fuel.

Big Boy 4014 was a 6,300-horsepower brute that dragged heavy freight trains over the mountains of Wyoming and Utah . Fascination: Train enthusiasts gather to get a look at Big Boy No. 4014 in Salt Lake City . Boy oh boy: The 4014 hides some slick engineering, according to experts, which includes a suspension system that kept the drive wheels pressed against the rails when the locomotive straddled hills . The American Locomotive Co. in . Schenectady, N.Y., built 25 of the monsters to Union Pacific's . specifications between 1941 and 1944, and they became legendary. They . were the largest steam locomotives ever to work the rugged terrain of . the American West, and by most standards the largest anywhere in the . world. Even the name is legendary. An unknown . worker scrawled 'Big Boy' on the front of one of the engines when it was . under construction. Big Boys are 132 feet long, including . the tender, which carried coal and water. They weigh 1.2 million pounds . with a full load of fuel. They are essentially two engines under one . boiler, with two sets of eight drive wheels, each set powered by two . enormous cylinders nearly 2 feet across. Big Boys are so big that the front set of drive wheels has to pivot separately from the back set to get around curves. They were designed to run at speeds up to 80mph, but generally didn't exceed 60mph and generated the most horsepower at 35mph. And they aren't just big, McCulloh said. They were engineered to reach 80 mph, even though the railroad never intended to run them that fast. The point was to fine-tune the locomotives so they stayed in balance at any speed and didn't beat themselves up with their own powerful forces. 'You get all that machinery to live in harmony,' McCulloh said. Their enormous bulk also hid some slick engineering, including a suspension system that kept the drive wheels pressed against the rails when the locomotive straddled hills or valleys. Seventeen Big Boys were scrapped when they were pulled from service, but eight survived and are on display around the country. Union Pacific chose the 4014 for restoration because it spent more than 50 years in the friendly climate of Southern California, at the RailGiants Train Museum at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds. The museum took good care of the locomotive, Dickens said, and many of the original components are usable. RailGiants agreed to give the Big Boy back to the Union Pacific in exchange for some other equipment to display. No. 4014 has been moved from the museum to a Union Pacific shop in Colton, Calif., where a crew is preparing to tow it across Nevada, Utah and Wyoming to Cheyenne, arriving May 8. The UP maintains two other working steam locomotives there, and Dickens and his crew of seven can manufacture almost anything they need. 'This equipment, nobody's going to come in and fix it when it breaks down,' he said. 'We're it.' Restoration is expected to take three to five years. The railroad would like to have the Big Boy operating by 2019 for the 150th anniversary of the driving of the Golden Spike in Utah, which linked the Union Pacific with the Central Pacific and completed the first transcontinental railroad. It's too early to predict where the restored locomotive will travel. Railroad officials said they will have to choose the routes carefully to make sure bridges and tunnels can handle the Big Boy's weight and size. Overjoyed railroad fans are following closely. Wrinn heard from an American soldier serving overseas who was watching live video of the project. People have offered to donate money or even buy lunch for the Union Pacific steam crew, Dickens said, but he allowed that the Omaha, Neb.-based railroad — No. 138 on the Fortune 500 list — can afford the project on its own. Dickens declined to say how much restoration will cost. It might be less than people think, he said, because the railroad can do much of the work in-house. Pouring money into a 73-year-old mechanical relic makes good marketing sense, said Glen Gilmore, a digital and social media marketing expert who also teaches at Rutgers University. 'Nearly everyone has a fascination with trains,' Gilmore said in an email to The Associated Press.

"Their friendship stretches back more than 20 years since they were both members of their local Brownie pack. But the Duchess of Cambridge was a notable absentee yesterday as her chum Mary Bucknell walked down the aisle. Well-wishers who had gathered at St Mary the Virgin church in Kate’s home village of Bucklebury, Berkshire, were hoping to catch a glimpse of the Duchess as estate agent Ms Bucknell married Royal Marines Captain Simon Cox. But guests managed to hide their disappointment and were delighted instead to welcome Kate’s sister Pippa and her parents Carole and Michael Middleton. Ms Bucknell and Capt Cox were invited to last year’s Royal Wedding, so there was much speculation that the Duchess and Prince William would attend yesterday’s service. Family connection: The Duchess of Cambridge's mother Carole Middleton, left in a printed dress, and sister Pippa, right in a navy lace by Project D, attended the wedding in Bucklebury, Berkshire . The Royal couple, who have just returned from their tour of South-East Asia, had made a fleeting visit to Bucklebury 48 hours earlier. One onlooker said: ‘We were expecting Kate and William to turn up, especially after Simon and Mary were invited to their wedding. ‘But I had a word with the bride’s mother and she said Kate couldn’t make it, although Michael, Carole and Pippa were there.’ Pippa, 28, arrived wearing a navy lace dress by Project D London (the label run by Dannii Minogue and Tabitha Somerset Webb) that bore a striking resemblance to the Erdem outfit her elder sister wore during her tour of Canada last year. Carole Middleton also looked radiant in a blue Beulah London dress, cream hat and nude heels. After the ceremony, the Middletons chatted happily with other guests, before the party made their way to the bride’s home for the reception. The Duchess and the bride became friends during their time in the 1st St Andrew’s Brownie pack in Pangbourne.

"Following the ban of social media site Twitter in Turkey last week, today video website Youtube has also been blocked in the country. The ban comes after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was quoted by Reuters at a rally last week saying: 'I don't understand how people of good sense could defend this Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. There are all kinds of lies there.' Google has confirmed reports that some users have been unable to access the site. It is thought that some internet users in the country can still access Youtube. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan banned Twitter last week. Today reports that Youtube is now blocked in Turkey have emerged from the country . The video website has been blocked after voice recordings of senior officials discussing a potential military operation in Syria have flooded the site - it  is believed. Government officials confirmed today that more social media platforms could be blocked if national security was threatened. At a rally today, the Prime Minister described the fact that the audio had been posted on Youtube as 'villainous'. A source at the Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office said today that the videos had caused 'a national security issue'. The source said that Turkey was in talks with the video sharing platform and may lift the ban if YouTube agreed to remove the content. Turkey's courts blocked access to Twitter last week following Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's vow, on . the campaign trail ahead of key March 30 local elections, to 'wipe out' the service. The Twitter ban was lifted yesterday. In a defiant stand, Mr Erdogan said he did not care what the . international community had to say about the move. People across the country have today tweeted pictures of their computer screens featuring the blocked Youtube message. Journalist Jonathon Burch, tweeting from Turkey, posted this picture on his Twitter page earlier today. Amnesty International also tweeted about the ban today. The charity wrote: '#Turkey moves to block Youtube, after cutting off Twitter. Will Facebook be next?' Mr Erdogan spoke at a rally today in Diyarbakir, one of the largest cities in southeastern Turkey. He slammed opponents for leaking an audio tape on Youtube of a security meeting discussing potential military action in Syria . Youtube logos on a computer screen partially covered with Turkey's national flag . Last week, Turkey's Prime Minister used the expression 'Twitter, mwitter!,' to describe the social media website to thousands of rally supporters. The phrase can be translated roughly as 'Twitter, schmitter!' 'The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is,' Mr Erdogan said. Links on social networks have proliferated linking to recordings that appear to incriminate the Prime Minister and other top officials in corruption. This computer screen shows blocked access to Twitter last week . Last week, some users found a way of getting around the Twitter ban by using Google's DNS tool. The tool allows internet users to browse from another domain name system. A DNS transforms the name of a website into a series of numbers known as an IP address. Twitter users in Turkey circulated the alternative DNS address 8.8.8.8 on social media. Graffiti with the words has also appeared on a wall in the country. A logo with the Twitter symbol and the words #DirenTwitter and its English translation #OccupyTwitter also went viral. #Turkey was once again trending today following the Youtube block in the country. The Prime Minister, who . has been in power for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that . has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government . wrongdoing. Links on social networks have . proliferated linking to recordings that appear to incriminate the Prime . Minister and other top officials in corruption. Street graffiti in Turkey with the DNS code that allows internet users to access Twitter . A campaign opposing the Twitter ban went viral in Turkey. These posters contain the alternative DNS address for Twitter from a computer in Turkey as well as the hashtag which has gone viral. #Turkey was trending today on the social media website . Turkey has blocked access to . Youtube in the past, last week was the first ban on social media website Twitter. The social network was instrumental in organizing flash protests against . the government last year. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government's reputation ahead of local elections this month. Despite the ban, tech-savvy users managed to tweet links to the recordings last Friday. President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan's, was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. Turkish President Abdullah Gul has blasted the ban and continued tweeting from his page today . The country's President Abdullah Gul said that it was unacceptable to impose complete bans on social media platforms such as Twitter. 'I hope this implementation won't last long,' he wrote. 'One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,' Mr . Gul tweeted. He said only individual Internet pages should be blocked if . there is a court order on the grounds that a person's privacy is being . violated. Mr Gul co-founded the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party with Erdogan and has . remained a close ally. But he is viewed as a more conciliatory figure . than the combative Prime Minister and their relations have at times . appeared strained. Mr Erdogan's ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, . handed government more influence over the courts, and reassigned . thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights a . corruption scandal he has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust . him. Many - although not all - users trying to access the network early on Friday instead saw a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing four court orders. The site was blocked early this morning in Turkey . Turkey's lawyers' association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey's main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation. Twitter's (at)policy account sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or 'SMS.' It was unclear how those tweets would be viewable. Telecoms . watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the . courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching . privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove . content. 'Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was . blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future . victimization of citizens,' it said. European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey - a country that is seeking to join the European Union - as 'groundless, pointless, cowardly.' Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned. Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications in Turkey, said his office was merely obeying court orders. President Abdullah Gul continued using Twitter despite the ban. His last Tweet was sent at 9.35am . Chancellor Angela Merkel's government criticised Turkey saying the ban did not fit with Germany's view of freedom of expression. 'What we are hearing from Turkey does not comply with what we in Germany understand as free communication,' said Mrs Merkel's spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz. 'It doesn't fit with our idea of freedom of expression to forbid or block any form of communication,' she added. In response to the Twitter ban in Turkey, Dr Paul Dwyer, social media expert from the University of Westminster, said: 'President Erdogan said, when he attempted to close down access to Twitter, ‘everyone will see how powerful Turkey is’. 'In fact, of course, he has simply demonstrated how powerful Twitter is. 'Social media are a part of politics - and everything else we do. And so we must learn to use them well and for good, otherwise we will find ourselves, as President Erdogan now does, out of touch with the modern world.'","Twitter was banned in the country last week .

"With its matted hair and bald patches it resembles a much-loved toy somewhat past her prime. In fact this creature is the best-preserved specimen of a woolly mammoth ever found – whose prehistoric prime was 39,000 years ago. Even clumps of the animal’s distinguishing hair are remarkably intact after being trapped in glacial ice until she was discovered in Siberia earlier this year. A 39,000-year-old female woolly mammoth, which was found frozen in Siberia in May, is seen here upon its arrival at an exhibition hall in Yokohama, south of Tokyo. The mammoth will be on display for tourists and visitors from 13 July until 16 September . The mammoth, pictured, was discovered in an ice tomb in the New Siberian Islands, or Novosibirsk Islands earlier this year. Parts of the carcass are especially well preserved because they remained entirely frozen for thousands of years . Last year a controversial Australian billionaire was believed to be drawing up secret plans for a real-life Jurassic Park. Mining . magnate Clive Palmer, who has already embarked on a project to rebuild . the Titanic, was rumoured to be working with the team who created Dolly . the sheep. But . the research has shown the dinosaurs may have to stay on the big screen . - as their DNA is just too old to be able to use for de-extinction. However, Korean scientists are hoping that the samples found on the Siberian woolly mammoth aren't too old. They plan to take the DNA samples and reassemble them into a full genome. This could then be injected into embryonic cells which have had their own DNA . taken out, and a suitable living surrogate would be found. She is now to go on public display in  Yokohama, Japan. But while the public can get a remarkable glimpse of our planet’s past, scientists will be continuing tests that could give the extinct species a future. Experts who found the female mammoth in May also discovered a sample of its blood inside ice beneath the carcass – which scientists claim may be used to regrow one of the animals, which last walked the earth around 4,000 years ago. Preserved muscle tissue was also found from the creature, which was aged between 50 and 60 when she died, according to the Russian team who made the discovery on islands off the northern coast of Siberia. Semyon Grigoriev, from the North Eastern Federal University in Siberia, said: ‘We were really surprised to find mammoth blood and muscle tissue.’ He hailed it as ‘the best-preserved mammoth in the history of paleontology’. A worker at the exhibition hall in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, inspects the snout of the 39,000-year-old woolly mammoth. Scientists discovered a well-preserved sample of blood from the creature in May and are looking into ways in which the extinct species could be brought back from extinction . The snout of the 39,000-year-old mammoth, pictured, on display in Tokyo. When the mammoth was discovered preserved muscle tissue was also found from the creature, aged between 50 and 60 when she died, according to the Russian team who made the discovery on islands off the northern coast of Siberia . The foot of the female woolly mammoth, pictured, shows that many of the animal's original features - including the hair that gave the mammoth its woolly name - is still intact. The upper torso and two legs, which were found in the soil and not buried in ice, were gnawed by predators and almost didn't survive . Parts of the carcass are especially . well preserved because they remained entirely frozen for thousands of . years – including the hair. However, . the upper torso and two legs, which were entombed in the soil, have . been gnawed by prehistoric and modern predators and almost did not . survive. It is the first ever well-preserved . sample of blood from a woolly mammoth and has reopened the debate over . the morality of Jurassic Park-style projects to restore extinct . creatures to the planet . The blood and other samples have been . made available to South Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk’s private . bioengineering laboratory. The laboratory has confirmed it is working with other . mammoth DNA samples in a bid to return the extinct Siberian mammoth. The eventual plan is to plant an implanted egg into a live elephant for a 22-month pregnancy. The hope is that at least one living cell of the mammoth was preserved ‘although even with such well-preserved remains, this may not be the case’. Earlier this year a group of scientists from around the world met for the TEDx conference in Washington, sponsored by National Geographic. The group were discussing the possibility of bringing 24 animals back from extinction, also known as ‘de-extinction’. The animals included the dodo bird, the Carolina Parakeet, last seen in 1904 in Florida. The Quagga, a plains zebra which once lived in South Africa but died out in 1883. However, some scientists insist it will be impossible to create the same mammoths as once roamed the earth. A researcher from the Museum of Mammoths of the Institute of Applied Ecology at the North-Eastern Federal University, pictured, working near a carcass of the female mammoth found on a remote island off the coast of Siberia in May . A researcher from the North-Eastern Federal University in Siberia holds a test tube with a sample of  well-preserved blood found in a carcass of a female woolly mammoth. The sample was discovered on a remote island in the Arctic Ocean and is thought to be the first discovery of its kind . Dr Grigoriev initially put the age of the animal at around 10,000 years but more recent dating tests suggest the creature is much older, dating back around 39,000 years. ‘It is great luck that the blood preserved and we plan to study it carefully,’ he said. ‘For now our suspicion is that mammoth blood contains a kind of natural anti-freeze.’ He suggested that the animal was so well preserved because it did not ‘defrost and then freeze again’. ‘We suppose the mammoth fell into water or got bogged down in a swamp, could not free herself and died,’ he added. ‘Due to this fact the lower part of the body was preserved very well.’ As well as a sample of blood, Russian scientists also discovered a well-preserved sample of muscle tissue from the woolly mammoth carcass. The blood and tissue were preserved because they were buried in an ice tomb on the Novosibirsk islands for what's thought to have been 10,000 years . The woolly mammoth was probably wiped out by rapid climate change caused by a meteor striking the Earth, not by overhunting as previously believed .","Female woolly mammoth was found frozen in a Siberian ice tomb in May .

"A raging wildfire could have turned an Oregon couple's wedding into a nightmare on Saturday, but the adaptable bride and groom instead saw an opportunity to create stunningly unique wedding photos. Michael Wolber and April Hartley were hosting their nuptials in the gorgeous outdoor scenery near Bend, Oregon when what started as a small brush fire quickly grew into a raging inferno. Moments after Hartley began her walk down the aisle, fire trucks shattered the peaceful scene and firefighters regretfully told bride, groom and celebrants to find safer ground.

"A 102-year-old letter found in a couple’s attic has revealed that  Titanic was nearly stopped from beginning its doomed voyage. The letter, which sold for £24,000  at an auction this afternoon, reveals that the large wake caused by Titanic leaving Southampton snapped the mooring ropes of two ships, New York and Oceanic. Titanic was seconds away from hitting New York - but changed direction just in time. If the crash had happened it would have without doubt changed the course of history, auctioneers have said. Scroll down for video . A 102-year-old letter from the chief engineer of Titanic to his son has revealed that the ship almost collided with two other vessels as it left Southampton to begin its doomed voyage . Titanic chief engineer Joseph Bell, pictured on his wedding day with his wife, Maud, sent the letter, which shows that Titanic was seconds away from hitting another ship, potentially changing the course of history . The letter, written by chief engineer Joseph Bell to his son Frank, said: ‘We have made a good run from Southampton, everything is working A1. ‘We nearly had a collision with New York and Oceanic when leaving Southampton. The wash of our propellers made the two ships range about when we were passing them, this made their mooring ropes break and the New York set off across the river until the tugs got hold of her again. ‘No damage was done but it looked like trouble at the time. Keep well and be a good lad. ‘Regards to Mrs Johnston. Your loving father, J. Bell.’ Mr Bell posted the letter from Queenstown - now Cobh - in Ireland on April 11, 1912. Three days later, Titanic, described as ‘practically unsinkable’, hit an iceberg and sank. It killed more than 1,500 people including Mr Bell, who left behind his wife Maud and four children. Andrew Aldridge, from Henry Aldridge and Son auctioneers, said: ‘We got a phone call six months ago from a couple in the UK who are distant direct relations to Joseph Bell. They had just discovered this letter, which had been in their attic for decades. 'We have had a great deal of interest from collectors across the world including the UK, United States, China and Russia. ‘The letter is particularly interesting because of who wrote it and the fact it describes the event in detail. ‘Mr Bell also ironically describes everything as “working A1” on board the liner when she left Southampton. ‘The crash would not have been a disaster but would have been bad enough to delay Titanic for a day or two as the structural integrity of the hull would have needed to be checked. Without a doubt it would have changed the course of history.' A lunch menu for the first-class restaurant on board Titanic is also up for sale at an auction this afternoon . Elise Lurette (left) was carrying a deck plan of Titanic that helped her get to the lifeboats when the ship hit an iceberg. The cover of the deck plan is pictured right . The deck plan was only given to staff and first-class passengers aboard the doomed ship, which sank in 1912 . Mr Bell was born on March, 12 1861 in Farlam, Cumbria. He left Cumbria and went to Newcastle to work as an apprentice engine fitter at Robert Stephenson and Company, a locomotive manufacturing firm. In 1885, Mr Bell joined shipping company White Star Line. He travelled to New Zealand and New York and served on 18 ships. He married Maud Bates in 1893 and had four children - Frances, Marjorie Clare, Eileen Maud and Ralph Douglas. A decade later, the family moved to Belfast and Mr Bell became chief engineer on RMS Olympic, an ocean liner which was also described as ‘unsinkable’. He was transferred to Titanic and oversaw the construction of the ship. He was 51-years-old when Titanic sank. His gravestone is engraved with ‘no greater love hath man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends’. Mr Bell’s letter is not the only significant document to be auctioned on Saturday. A first class luncheon menu from April 12, 1912, a deck plan and a postcard from a maid are also up for sale. Ms Lurette sent a postcard to her nephew from Titanic when it stopped off at Queenstown, in Ireland . The postcard, which had a picture of the Titanic on one side, the deck plan and the lunch menu were found in Miss Lurette's coat pocket . The three documents were in the pocket of a coat that 59-year-old Eugénie Elise Lurette, a maid, was wearing when she got into Lifeboat 6. She boarded Titanic at Cherbourg and was travelling with her employers William and Marie Spencer. A member of crew woke her up after the ship hit the iceberg and she was rescued. The menu showed that the wealthy passengers feasted on mutton chops, roast beef, Melton Mowbray pie, lamb and mint sauce, ox tongue, tapioca pudding and greengage tart for the Friday afternoon lunch. Welsh rarebit and Omer Pacha egg were crossed off as they had been taken off the menu for that day. Miss Lurette sent the postcard to her nephew from Titanic when it stopped off at Queenstown. Despite being used to the extravagant and opulent lifestyle of her employers, Elise wrote that the levels of luxury and comfort on the liner were 'unknown to her until this day.' The menu and deck plan fetched £60,000 and £23,000, and the postcard sold for £62,000. March 31, 1909: Construction work on Titanic begins in Belfast Harbour. May 31, 1911: Titanic is first launched in front of an audience of 100,000 people. Noon, April 10, 1912: Titanic departs Southampton with 922 passengers on board.
