"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Police were called to a pub’s beer garden after a squirrel climbed inside a woman’s handbag and refused to get out. The woman, in her 30s, dialled 999 from the Shropshire Arms in Chester to say the squirrel ‘would not leave her alone’. Detective Constable Nigel Thake, of Cheshire Constabulary, promptly arrived and managed to send the rodent on its way. Police were able to coax the squirrel out of the woman's handbag after the emergency call out . Officers released the squirrel after removing him to a local park . The incident happened at the Shropshire Arms in Chester, pictured . Writing about the incident on its official Twitter account, the force said: ‘Welcome to the varied day of a police officer’, and referred to DC Thake as ‘Dr Dolittle’. A police spokesman added: ‘The squirrel was released back into the wild.’ Local resident Tom Scott said: ‘I would have thought this was a case for the RSPCA rather than the police, but it just goes to show that the police are up for whatever gets thrown at them.’ Luckily, the animal in question was nowhere near Phil Warmlsey's pie shop Something Nice in Old Dalby, Leicestershire, where the 46-year-old businessman has developed a new range of squirrel pies. He said: 'We started with kangaroo, crocodile, elk, buffalo and wagyu beef. We found a niche in the market. There are plenty of grey squirrels – they’re classified as vermin and it’s legal to kill them . 'In a pie, it has similar characteristics to rabbit – it is a dark meat and very gamey. People come back for more because it has an excellent flavour – deep and rich.’ Squirrel was a popular dish in Victorian times and according to Mr Warmsley, customers love the exotic dish. He sells the pies for £2.50 each. He said: 'Killing more grey squirrels could give the red squirrel a chance to repopulate. 'You do get the odd person who asks how I can do this to such a lovely creature, but being at the top of the food chain we have the luxury of being able to eat what we want and they are vermin.'","Scared woman was unable to coax the squirrel from her handbag .

"By . Amanda Williams . Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has risked the anger of Scottish nationalists - by claiming the kilt was invented by the English. The controversial BBC host, who is set to retire from the show, also said there was a 'head of steam in Scotland for hating the English' during an interview with Radio 4’s Saturday Live. Mr Paxman went on to suggest that the Highland clearances, often associated with English repression of the Scots, was one of the 'great sustaining myths' of the country. Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has risked the wrath of Scottish nationalists - by claiming the kilt was invented by the English . Asked by Saturday Live presenter Aasmah Mir, how he liked the inclusiveness of ‘Britishness’, Mr Paxman said: 'Increasingly, since there is now such a head of steam in Scotland for . hating the English, I describe myself as English, although I am in fact . one quarter Scottish. 'It’s interesting, isn’t it, that in this union of supposed equals, only one side gets to vote on whether the union continues.' A spokesman for the Yes Scotland independence campaign said Mr Paxman’s comments were as 'mad as ever', the Independent reports. The veteran presenter later added that . 'hate' was an overstatement, but that is was more to do with a . detestation of being 'ruled from London'. Paxman, . who has penned a book on national identity called The English, said . that he would love to write a book abut the Scottish. It has been claimed  since the 18th century that the short philabeg currently reognised as the traditional kilt was invented by a Thomas Rawlinson, a Lancashire Quaker . He said: 'We might start tackling some of the great sustaining Scottish myths, like the kilt, which was actually invented by an Englishman as far as I can tell. And the Highland clearances...' The Highland clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries saw poor Highland farmers evicted from the land their family had called home for centuries, devastating Gaelic culture and clan society. Some historians have claimed that clan leaders were as responsible for the clearances and resulting devastation as English - in their support for Bonnie Prince Charlie. Paxman did not elaborate on what he meant in his reference to the clearances. His comments about the kilt were also unexplained. It has been claimed that the short  philabeg currently recognised as the traditional kilt was invented by a Thomas Rawlinson, a Lancashire Quaker . The origin of the kilt, as we know it . today, has been traced back to an English Quaker from Lancashire, . according to the last book written by the late Lord Dacre of Glanton. The . book, The Invention of Scotland: Myth and History, was written by Lord . Dacre, formerly Hugh Trevor-Roper. He claimed that the traditional dress of . the Highlanders was a long Irish shirt and a cloak or plaid. The stripes and colours of tartan were actually worn by the higher classes, he said. He claimed that Thomas Rawlinson shortened the plaids of his workmen in the Highlands after they said they were uncomfortable. This theory has also been contested by . historians who claim that there is evidence of the short kilts being . worn long before Rawlinson arrived in Scotland in the 1720s.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Millions face a postcode lottery in GP services as chronic underfunding has left doctors surgeries 'on the brink of collapse', a top medic has warned. Research carried out by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) showed a stark divide in access to doctors, with people living in the most deprived communities facing the longest waiting times. The study found that 22 per cent of people in Bradford raised concerns about not being able to make an appointment with their GP. Millions face a postcode lottery in GP services as chronic underfunding has left doctors surgeries 'on the brink of collapse' Whereas the figure was just five per cent in Bath and north-east Somerset. There are 'shocking discrepancies' in the number of GPs employed locally, the RCGP warned. North, east and west Devon have 60 GPs for every 100,000 patients - three times as many as Slough in Berkshire which has just 22. The poorest appear to be the hardest hit - eight of out of ten areas with the longest GP waiting times having moderate to high levels of deprivation. The College said the research, based on the GP Patient Survey, showed the profession is 'creaking under the weight of a growing and ageing population'. They have launched a campaign to demand an extra £3.5 billion a year to be ploughed into GP services, and have put up posters in surgeries showing patients having to queue down the street for an appointment unless extra cash is found. Dr Maureen Baker, chairwoman of the RCGP said: 'Every single patient should be able to see their GP when they are in need of medical assistance, regardless of where they live. 'It is absolutely shocking that, due to the current funding crisis in general practice, patients are now facing a postcode lottery. There are 'shocking discrepancies' in the number of GPs employed locally, the RCGP warned . 'It is doubly unacceptable that those patients affected tend to be those who live in deprived parts of the country.' A growing and ageing population coupled with a surge in patients with multiple and chronic conditions was piling pressure on GPs, but their share of the NHS budget has been slashed, she said. Dr Baker said: 'Family doctors are working harder than ever - but with increasing patient demand, due to a growing and ageing population, and plummeting investment, there simply aren't enough GPs to go round. 'There is now a desperate shortage of GPs in many parts of the country, leaving the service teetering on the brink of collapse. She added: 'Over the last decade, investment in general practice has slumped and has now reached an all-time low, with GPs conducting 90 per cent of NHS patient contacts for just 8.5 per cent of the total NHS budget. 'GPs want to provide high-quality care for every single patient, but at a time of plummeting resources we are seeing 40 million more patients a year than just five years ago. 'The simple fact is that family doctors are now heaving under unsustainable workloads, with the majority now routinely conducting 60 patient consultations in a single day.' The College said the number of visits to GPs has soared from an estimated 300m to 340m in the past five years, and at least 10,000 more GPs need to be recruited to ease the pressure. Dr Patricia Wilkie, president of the National Association for Patient Participation said: 'Patients across the country are frequently unable to obtain a timely appointment with a GP, because there simply aren't enough GPs in some local areas. 'This postcode lottery is totally inappropriate with clear and potentially serious implications for patients. 'It is clear that the root of the problem is a shortage of GPs and the lack of funding for general practice. Without appropriate funding for general practice the situation for patients will only deteriorate.' NHS England said they are recruiting and training more GPs. A spokeswoman said: 'Patients should have good access to health services, regardless of where they live. 'This year, for the first time, NHS England introduced a deprivation factor into local health budgets to start to redress historic funding issues.'","Research was carried out by the Royal College of General Practitioners .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This is the moment a bin cleaner came within moments of winning £5.5million at York races – only to see his horse miss out on the crucial first place. But Craig Brazier, 39, still managed a smile, having pocketed £1.3million in an earlier gamble. The father-of-two had backed six winners in a ‘Scoop6’ bet the previous weekend, giving him a free selection for the race on Saturday and the chance to win a further £5.5million. As his choice, Tumblewind, approached the last furlong it seemed Mr Brazier might win. But his hopes were dashed in the last seconds as the horse dropped all the way back to 11th place. Bin cleaner Craig Brazier watches on as his £5.5 million horse hits the front just a furlong from home . The 39-year-old is just seconds away from scooping the monster jackpot as his horse Tumblewind approaches the winning post in York . The anticipation of the £5.5 million prize was cruelly torn away when the horse slowed up during the final ten seconds of the race, blowing its lead . Despite the result, Mr Brazier said: ‘I’ve enjoyed every minute … I’d backed the winner too many times on the all-weather without winning, so I’d never have picked it.’ Mr Brazier and seven others including 43-year-old Bernard Marantelli had backed six winners the previous Saturday on the Scoop6 to get a free selection on the Knavesmire and a chance to win a further £5.5 million. After winning £1.3 million the previous week he was given the chance to join Mr Marantelli and two other gamblers in a syndicate yesterday but he turned them down and decided to go it alone. Mr Brazier, who plans to go back to work bin cleaning, shook the Mr Marantelli’s hand over a glass of champagne in a box overlooking the finish line after the race. He said: ‘Good luck to them. ‘I have enjoyed every minute. It’s been absolutely brilliant and for a few seconds it looked like my pick Tumblewind had a great chance. ‘But I’d backed the winner too many times on the all weather without winning, so I’d never have picked it.

"By . Tara Brady . Jailed: Christopher Halliwell killed Sian O'Callaghan after picking her up in his cab in 2011 . Police fear they have discovered the secret lair of a suspected serial killer who may have murdered up to six women. Forensic officers have been scouring a remote pond following the discovery of boots belonging to murdered Sian O'Callaghan, 22. Jailed taxi driver Christopher Halliwell, 55, killed the clubber after picking her up in his cab outside a Swindon nightclub in 2011. Last month police found Miss O'Callaghan's brown boots, a shotgun, and a huge hoard of women's clothing in and around an 8ft deep pond in woodland in Ramsbury, Wiltshire. Halliwell admitted picking her up and murdering her and is now serving 25 years. The killer also led police to the grave of a second woman, Becky Godden-Edwards, who disappeared around 2007 when she was 25. However, he was formally cleared of murdering her when a judge ruled a senior detective had broken the rules surrounding arrests. A CID source said the recent finds have prompted fears there are more victims. An anonymous CID source told the Sunday Express: 'We are being methodical and careful. 'We don't want to make any mistakes and the major thrust is to find some link to Becky so we can re-interview Halliwell under caution. 'The nightmare scenario is that this lonely place might be linked to the murder of five innocent women or more. A buried cache of clothing is unlikely to be fly-tipping. 'There may be an innocent explanation, but everything hinges on the work of the forensic scientists. Halliwell admitted picking Sian O'Callaghan (right) up outside a club and murdering her. The killer also led police to the grave of a second woman, Becky Godden-Edwards (left) 'The discovery of Sian's boots, together with a shotgun barrel, in the pond nearby is undeniably sinister.' Police have continued to investigate the murder of Miss Godden, who had drifted into drugs and prostitution before her death. Officers found her remains in a field in Eastleach, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire in March 2011 having been led there by Halliwell. Last month they revealed they had found a bone at the Cotswold beauty spot, which belonged to Miss Godden. Detectives are believed to have the DNA of four other women, or close family matches to them, ready to compare with any samples found, the Sunday Express claimed. Four young women remain missing from nearby Swindon where Halliwell snatched Sian off the street before her near-naked body was found five days later in a shallow grave. Sally Ann John, 24, disappeared in September 1995 but despite continuous appeals she has never been seen. Still missing: Vietnamese national Thi Hai Nguyen, 20, (left) vanished in 2005. Linda Razzell (right) disappeared three years earlier aged 41. Her husband denies killing her . Sandra Brewin, of Peatmoor, disappeared from her parents' home in 1994 aged 21 just months after she became penfriends with a man who was in prison in Oxfordshire. Other unsolved missing person cases in the area include college worker mum-of-four Linda Razzell, 41, who disappeared from Swindon in 2002. Her husband, Glyn, was convicted of her killing but continues to protest his innocence. Police search an area of woodland and a pond near the village Ramsbury in Wiltshire as new evidence is found into the murder of Sian O'Callaghan . Police found Miss O'Callaghan's brown boots, a shotgun, and a huge hoard of women's clothing in and around an 8ft deep pond . The whereabouts of the young Vietnamese immigrant Thi Hai Nguyen, 20, have been unknown since she went missing from her temporary home in Swindon in June 2005. The CID source added: 'There is the chilling thought that Sian was not the first and Halliwell may have been roughly working to some dreadful blueprint from previous incidents. 'If it turns out the items of clothing found at Hilldrop belong to more than one missing woman it would go towards confirming the rather chilling theory that he may have had a routine.' Fresh evidence: Police search an area of woodland and a pond near the village Ramsbury in Wiltshire . The boot of Sian O'Callaghan was found by police three years after she was killed.  More clothing has been found at the site . Officers are draining and sieving thousands of litres of water from the 8ft deep pond to see what might be hidden at the bottom . A spokeswoman for Wiltshire Police yesterday (Sunday) did not deny officers were exploring the possibility Halliwell had more victims - but said the CID source's comments were 'highly speculative'. She said: 'The searches in the Ramsbury area have been completed as of 4.30pm on 31 May and the items found are now subject to review and testing. 'Wiltshire police have made no links to the missing women mentioned or any other cases at this stage. A cardigan found close to a pond on Hill Drop Lane two miles from the village of Ramsbury, Wiltshire . Grim: A police tent near the site where detectives say they have uncovered 60 items of women's clothing . 'Although a 'CID' source has been quoted, the comments made by this individual are highly speculative and unhelpful to our investigations. 'Detectives are in the early stages of the review and any forensic testing. 'Speculation such as this is unhelpful and can be potentially distressing for families who may have lost their loved ones. 'Wiltshire Police are committed to ensuring a thorough investigation and will maximise any evidential opportunities that are found. 'However, at this stage it is too early to make links to missing women or to speculate on why the items were found there.'","Officers found boots belonging to murdered Sian O'Callaghan, 22 .

"By . Leon Watson . National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has revealed secrets about how British spy chiefs listen in on suspected terrorists . Edward . Snowden has revealed so much about how British spies work he has left the UK wide open to ­Al Qaeda attacks, it was reported today. Intelligence chiefs believe terrorists have changed their methods after the whistleblower exposed how GCHQ was listening in on them. Britain's spy bosses have already warned he put agents' lives at risk by passing secrets to Russian president Vladimir Putin in return for sanctuary. But now Government sources say MI5 and . MI6 have lost their digital advantage, which allowed them to detect and . foil terror plots. A senior Whitehall source told the Sunday People: 'Parts of the radar have gone dark and that is very worrying. Snowden has ­committed the worst kind of treachery.' Snowden, . 30, became one of the world’s most wanted men last June when he broke . cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified documents from the . U.S. National Security Agency. He . leaked details of attempts by state spy agencies – including Britain’s . GCHQ – to illegally view citizens’ private information. Snowden also claimed internet history, emails, text messages, calls and passwords were harvested. And he made the highly damaging revelation that the U.S. had hacked . Chinese computers and the communications of allies such as Germany and . France. The . defence contractor, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence . centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he . could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in U.S. history, on a par with WikiLeaks whistleblower Bradley Manning. Snowden is now stranded in Moscow as a fugitive after America took away his passport. In . the past, GCHQ agents could listen in as terrorists used email, in-game . communication, social networking and chat-rooms to communicate. Spy chiefs say Edward Snowden has left Britain wide open to terrorist attack. Pictured here is the number 30 double-decker bus in Tavistock Square which was destroyed by a terrorist bomb on 7/7 . By analysing their propaganda, travel arrangements, money movements and attempts to ­radicalise individuals, Britain's spooks were able to build up a picture of their activities. But Snowden revealed the UK was monitoring . communications on a vast scale and claimed intelligence agencies were . able to ­'listen' to millions of personal internet messages by using . GCHQ's Tempora programme. Snowden claims he acted after becoming . convinced the US  government’s actions were a ‘threat to democracy’. He . fled to Hong Kong, then Moscow, where he was granted asylum and now . lives in a secret location. Much of the stolen information was revealed by the Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post. But there are mounting suspicions Snowden had been recruited – unwittingly or not – by foreign agents. Intelligence chiefs believe he is now a ‘puppet' passing details of military capabilities, operations and tactics to Putin's henchmen, although he denies taking any classified material to Russia.","Spy chiefs believe terrorists have changed their methods .

"The London property boom is being felt in the suburbs and commuter towns such as Brighton and Windsor, latest figures reveal. There has also been a sharp rise in parts of the Midlands and the North. Land Registry data showed that London house prices rose at their fastest monthly rate since records began in 1995, to an average of £435,034. The London property boom is being felt in the suburbs and commuter towns such as Brighton (pictured) Across England and Wales prices rose by 6.7 per cent in 12 months. The study of data was carried out by Savills Research and showed that several areas were feeling the 'London effect'. Nearly 1,000 homes every month are now being sold for more than £1million. Figures reveal that around 30 houses a day are changing hands for seven figure sums – up two-thirds on a year ago. Outside London, the most expensive areas are Windsor (pictured) and Maidenhead, where the average house costs £366,333 . And all regions of the country have seen property prices jump over the past year, according to the latest data from the Land Registry. Their report will fuel fears that a dangerous house price bubble is developing in some areas, particularly London and the South East. The figures show 836 houses changed hands for at least £1million in England and Wales in February – up 65 per cent from 507 in the same month last year. Experts predict the number will soon exceed 1,000. It is already significantly higher than the 740 homes a month, or 24 a day, which sold for at least £1million at the peak of the pre-recession boom in 2007. In 2004, just 11 homes a day were changing hands for seven figures. The average house price across England and Wales rose 6.7 per cent in the 12 months to April to hit £172,069 – the biggest increase for four years. Land Registry data showed that London house prices rose at their fastest monthly rate since records . began in 1995 . All regions have seen prices jump over the past year, from a 17 per cent rise in London to a 2.9 per cent increase in the North East. The most . expensive area of London is the exclusive Royal Borough of Kensington . and Chelsea, where a typical home sells for £1.27million. Meanwhile, . prices are rising fastest in Waltham Forest in the north-east of the . capital, where they soared 26.2 per cent to £323,288 in the year to . April. The largest increase outside London was in Brighton, where values have risen by 31 per cent since 2009 . Tina Templeman, of Mishon Mackay estate agents in Brighton, told The Sunday Telegraph that a fifth of its buyers in the first few months of the year were from London. 'We are definitely seeing the London effect,' she said. Outside London, the most expensive areas are Windsor and Maidenhead, where the average house costs £366,333, and Surrey at £328,328. And after the capital, prices are rising fastest in Oldham, where they are up 12.1 per cent. But the average home there still costs just £82,845, the report shows. In Hertfordshire, prices have risen by 22 per cent since 2009. Several areas of Northern England also saw significant year-on-year price increases, with a 5.5 per cent rise in Yorkshire and the Humber pushing the average house price to £120,118. The North West has seen growth of 3.8 per cent, taking the typical value to £112,064, and in Wales, prices have increased by 3 per cent over the past year to reach £117,581 on average. Experts said the property boom is extending beyond London as the economic recovery and the Government’s controversial Help to Buy scheme boost demand.","The study of data was carried out by Savills Research .

"By . Hugo Gye . Killed: James Hunter, 18, was stabbed to death in a street fight in south-east London last night . Three teenage boys - one aged just 13 - have been arrested on suspicion of murder after an 18-year-old was stabbed to death last night. The victim, named locally as James Hunter, was killed during a street fight in Sydenham, south-east London. His brother could be heard screaming hysterically while paramedics battled unsuccessfully to save the teenager's life. Three suspects, one aged 13 and the other two 15, are being questioned by police on suspicion of murder. A 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of assault, while another 17-year-old who was also stabbed in the fight is currently in a stable condition in hospital. Police and paramedics were called to the area around 8.30 last night, and Mr Hunter was declared dead at the scene an hour later. A local resident whose flat overlooks the scene of the fight said that he saw the victim's brother yelling after paramedics arrived at the scene. The witness said: 'He just kept shouting over and over, ""That's my brother, that's my brother!"" 'He was really upset, waving his arms around and screaming and kept putting his head in his hands. 'I saw the guy on the floor. There were people there doing CPR, but to me it just looked like the boy was dead.' Neighbour Khloe Crowley said she saw Mr Hunter less than an hour before he died, and insisted he was not a troublemaker. 'He was just a quiet boy and we used to see him around here with his friends,' she said. 'He would just nod and say hello, but was never in any trouble or anything like that. 'It's very sad - his friends and family are going to have to walk past that spot every day and think of what has happened.' Probe: Police investigating the scene in Sydenham today after Mr Hunter was killed yesterday . Tribute: A bunch of flowers which was left at the scene in memory of Mr Hunter . Russell Taylor of the Metropolitan Police urged witnesses to the incident to come forward. 'A number of youths gathered in Wells Park Road before a fight broke out,' he said. 'Many people would have witnessed the attack as well as the aftermath. 'I would urge those people to contact officers so that we can piece together the events that led up to this murder.' Clues: The Metropolitan Police are investigating a possible link to gang culture . A police spokesman said officers were investigating the possibility that the incident could have been gang-related. Mr Hunter is the fifth teenager to have been murdered in London last year.

"By . Wills Robinson . Concerns: Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has said children in Birmingham are being denied a 'rounded education' because of alleged Islamic practices in schools . Teachers are to be offered training to stop extremist and radical elements making their way into classrooms. Ofsted are planning to give school staff guidance in a bid combat the problems raised in the recent Trojan Horse scandal, according to a source at the Department for Education. It comes as around 20 schools in Birmingham are facing allegations that Muslims in senior positions have segregated boys and girls in classrooms, refused to teach sex education and have forced some female students to wear head scarfs. As a result, six schools, including Park View Academy, are understood to have been placed in special measures after they received damning reports into how they are run. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw is expected to highlight the problems across the city when the schools' inspections are published. According to The Sunday Times, he will also claim that children are being denied a 'rounded education' to prepare them for life as a Brit. Only two schools are thought to have been given positive feedback. Ninewells Academy has been described as having 'outstanding' management and its executive principle is said to have an 'extensive knowledge about the risk of radicalisation and extremism'. Washwood Heath Academy is believed to have been rated as 'good', but may require further inspection. Education secretary Michael Gove has written to all schools . and colleges in England urging them to watch out for signs of . radicalisation in the wake of the so-called Trojan Horse plot. The plot involves the alleged ousting of . headteachers, mainly in and around the Birmingham area, by Islamic . extremists attempting to take over several top schools in a bid to . target vulnerable young people. Controversy: Park View School, which is at the centre of the Trojan Horse plot allegations, has been accused of segregating women and children during lessons . Heads in the city were told at a recent . council meeting to expect a ‘bloody firestorm’ after investigations into . the Trojan Horse allegations are published. One of the most high-profile schools . involved in the claims, Park View Academy in Birmingham, has been . condemned for increasing ‘Islamisation’. It is claimed the school has hosted extremist preachers during assemblies and encouraged girls to cover their hair. The school was recently subject to an emergency investigation by schools watchdog Ofsted and was put in to special measures. Last week, Ofsted announced inspections were investigating a further three schools, bringing the total to 21. A spokesman for the watchdog said they will not be commenting before the reports on the schools are due to be published. The Department for Education also said they would not be commenting on the speculation.

"By . Daniel Mills . Television critic Clive James has joked that he is trying to fend off the terminal cancer he is battling in order to impress Prime Minister Tony Abbott's daughters. At 74 and facing an uncertain future, James said he had no plans of succumbing to the leukemia and emphysema he was diagnosed with in 2010 while speaking in front a crowd of 400 at the inaugural Australia and New Zealand Festival of Literature in London. 'As with every other red-blooded Australian male I'm doing it to impress Tony Abbott's daughters,' James said. Scroll down for video . Clive James speaking in front a crowd of 400 at the inaugural Australia and New Zealand Festival of Literature in London on Saturday . 'That statement will get me into terrific trouble with the Australian media where I'm regarded as something of a right-winger.' James also quipped that he plans to hold on until at least 2015 when the next series of Game Of Thrones is released to DVD. Describing it as another 'farewell appearance,' the author, poet and television celebrity segued into the discussion about Game Of Thrones while reading from a poem, Not My Best Side. Written by English poet U A Fanthorpe, the story delves into a princess’s conflicted, wry inner monologue as St George rescues her from the dragon. He said the reading was breaking one of his lifelong rules to read the poem, James said. 'It’s vital to have nothing to do with any art form which has dragons in it,' he explained. The 74-year-old joked he would fight his terminal leukemia and emphysema in order to impress Prime Minister Tony Abbott's daughters . James also quipped that he plans to hold on until at least 2015 when the next series of Game Of Thrones is released to DVD . Mr Abbott's daughters Frances (left) and Bridget (right) arrive at the Myer Autumn Winter 2014 Fashion Launch in February in Melbourne . 'I’ve lived by that rule all my life, successfully until quite recently when I was induced by members of my family to watch the first season of Game of Thrones.' Having been hooked by the episodes in the two series since, he said he has every intention of making it to a fourth. 'One of my ambitions at this age and in this condition, when I’m short of breath and perhaps not long for this world… my ambition now is to live until box four of Game of Thrones. It’s good to have a target in life.' He said his main reason for waiting until the DVD version was because he didn't quite have the  technological nous to work the knobs and buttons on his cable box. Uncertain future: Clive James said in an interview in 2012 that his cancers had 'beaten him' James, who lives in Cambridge, moved to the English city as he has to stay near hospital for blood transfusions and other treatments for leukemia and emphysema, so he finds it hard even to come into London. Clive James has forged a successful career in television and print and is one of Australia's best recognised expats . He has all but conceded that any realistic chance of air travel is now minimal, since flying is not recommended for someone with a condition as advanced as his. His stage of cancer also certainly means he will sadly never return to Australia. He said: 'The truth is I can't (return). Australia is a long way. If you've got weak lungs it can't be recommended.' As well as being a well-established television personality, James has also written literary criticism extensively for newspapers, magazines and periodicals in Britain, Australia and the United States. He has forged a successful career as one of Australia's most celebrated expats, while working mostly in the UK. In 1992, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) which was upgraded to Officer level (AO) in the 2013 Australia Day Honours and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to literature and the media.","The 74-year-old is fighting leukemia and emphysema .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The average British worker can be tempted into a new job for less than £2,000. The loyalty of workers here can be had for a pay rise of only 5.3 per cent, making employees here among the cheapest for companies luring away staff. At the average UK wage of £26,500, this means British staff need be offered a pay rise of just £1,722 to swap jobs. The average British worker will move to a new job for as little as a five per cent pay rise, a new study has shown (picture posed by models) Their readiness to jump ship contrasts sharply with workers in fast-growing economies who require much bigger incentives to leave their current positions. On average, employees in Indonesia would require a 20.6 per cent pay rise to change jobs, the going rate in Brazil is 20.1 per cent, 17.1 per cent in South Africa and 12 per cent in China, according to a study of 18,000 workers by global advisory firm CEB. Closer to home the size of carrot to lure people drops, but even workers in recession-hit Spain would want 5.9 per cent and those in France say they would need an 8.6 per cent rise in pay to move. The Scandinavian nations, which have largely avoided the effects of the global financial crisis, also require more to move than those in the UK, with an average raise of 6.7 per cent cited. In Europe only workers in Italy at 4.5 per cent, Germany at 3.9 per cent and Belgium and the Netherlands at 2.8 per cent are more cheaply bought than a British worker. The research shows that despite global economic recovery, pay expectations among workers have fallen on a worldwide basis. This year the all-country average for the compensation increase to move was a modest 8.6 per cent, down from 10.3 per cent a year ago. Despite the ending of the recession, the survey found that British workers feel the best way of securing a pay rise was to move job . Jean Martin, executive director at CEB, said: 'Britain’s great recession is over, but employees here remain surprisingly negative about their pay prospects in comparison with elsewhere. 'Perhaps Brits have absorbed the persistent message of a recessionary squeeze on budgets more than their counterparts. 'Our research in the first quarter of 2014 shows the percentage of HR executives in Europe expecting to see their budgets increase in the next 12 months has doubled compared to the same time last year. 'Economic prospects look better than they have for a long time but poor expectations on pay may mean our best talent is on the move just as we have more money to invest in them.' CEB also looked at the strongest drivers for moving jobs, with work-life balance the biggest attraction in the UK, followed by location, stability and then respect. Compensation was rated fifth most important by British workers, compared with first by those employed in Canada, China, France, Germany and the US. How actively people are seeking a new role was also investigated, with a reading of 39.9 in the UK for staff hunting jobs, a drop of 8.2 per cent on the previous quarter and just below the global average of 41. The most active job seekers are to be found in India, where the reading was 55.8, then South Africa at 51.9. The most passive nations are Japan at 30.2 and then Germany at 33.","Survey finds that workers feel moving job is the best way of getting pay rise .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Actress: Emily Mortimer has revealed the 'shame' she feels as a working mother when leaving her two children behind while she is away filming . Actress Emily Mortimer has revealed the 'shame' she feels as a working mother when leaving her two children behind while she is away filming. The Newsroom star, who has two children Samuel, ten, and four-year-old May, says she sometimes feels it might be 'better' were she a stay at home mother. Mortimer, 42, has described her stress at balancing a work and family life, particularly when filming the HBO drama series, in which she plays MacKenzie Morgan 'Mac' McHale, an executive producer at fictional cable news channel Atlantis Cable News. 'There's a shame involved in going off to . work which I try to talk myself out of but is nonetheless always a . little bit there,' the actress told The Observer Magazine. Mortimer, who married American actor Alessandro Nivola in 2003, is currently filming the show's third and final season, due to air this Autumn, and says the long hours and busy schedule take their toll. 'Even though my earnings from it help to . support my family, I still struggle with the weird feeling that I'm . indulging a hobby rather than doing a proper job, and that it might be . better if I just stayed at home,' she said. 'I don't feel proud of this feeling. I . hope my daughter will grow up to have the courage to write a TV show on . her own if she wants and not feel unnecessary confusion about doing a . great job while having a family at the same time.' The actress rose to fame in the late 1990s and early 2000s when a string of television roles led to parts in Kenneth Branagh's Love's Labours Lost and 51st State, starring Samuel L Jackson and Robert Carlyle.

Emily Mortimer's comments on balancing work with motherhood come weeks after Gwyneth Paltrow was criticised for saying how she found it 'harder' to raise children while maintaining an acting career than if she had a 9 to 5 job. In an interview with E!Online the actress said: 'I think it's different when you have an office job because It's routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening. 'When you're shooting a movie, they're like, 'We need you to go to Wisconsin for two weeks,' and then you work 14 hours a day and that part of it is very difficult.' While she made no mention of movie star salaries, she pointed out her perceived hardships further. 'I think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as, of course there are challenges, but it's not like being on set.' After receiving much backlash the Oscar winner attempted to clarify her comments in a post on her Goop blog. 'Film work takes one away from home and requires 12-14 hours a day, making it difficult to be the one to make the kids their lunch, drive them to school, and put them to bed.' She continued: 'This somehow was taken to mean I had said a 9-5 job is easier, and a lot of heat was thrown my way, especially by other working mothers who somehow used my out-of-context quote as an opportunity to express feelings (perhaps projected) on the subject.'","Actress, 42, says she feels 'shame' at leaving children behind while filming .

"By . Steph Cockroft . In the depths of a bitter winter, during one of the bloodiest wars in history, two warring sides laid down their weapons and took part in one of the most powerful shows of peace in history. On Christmas Day 1914, the sounds of firing rifles faded and British and German soldiers, who had been at war for five months, broke into an impromptu game of football in No Man's Land in Flanders, France. The poignant meeting between the trenches signalled a Christmas truce along the Western Front, which would prove to be only of the only glimpses of chivalry in an otherwise brutal war. Players took part in a reenactment of the iconic football match which took place on Christmas Day 1914 in Flanders, when British and German armies agreed a truce . The impromptu game broke out during the First World War after a German messenger walked across No Man's Land on Christmas Eve to broker a temporary ceasefire . The match, which was a replica on the Christmas Day truce came, took place in blistering temperatures - in direct comparison to the freezing winter which troops faced at the time . After Christmas Day, the war continued for another four years, killing up to ten million people. Now that match has been recreated on Saltburn beach, Teesside, to mark the First World War as the centenary of its start approaches. In starkly different circumstances, . including sweltering temperatures, two teams dressed up in historic wartime gear to reenact a version of the 1914 game. Watched by thousands of spectators, the two teams battled it out on the sand, in tribute to those who lost their lives during the conflict. Truce: A depiction of British and German soldiers playing football in 'No Man's Land' on the battlefield in World War One . The two teams dressed up in vintage army uniforms and played the game, which ended up with a 5-2 win to the 'British' side. There was also a . field of 8,000 poppies laid to create a temporary 'war cemetery' in tribute to the fallen. A Tiger Moth plane also flew overhead, scattering 40,000 poppy petals onto the crowds below. The 1914 game was one of many unofficial ceasefires . that took place along the Western Front around Christmas 1914 during that war. The truce began after a German messenger walked across No Man's Land on Christmas Eve to broker the temporary ceasefire. The event attracted thousands of people down to the beach, where the match was followed by many other activities to commemorate the fallen from the First World War . Two teams dressed up in vintage uniforms to replicate the match, which was also written about in the wartime novel Birdsong, by Sebastian Faulks . Organiser Allan Whiley said the event - which ended up with a 5-2 win to the British team - was arranged to commemorate the futility of war, as the centenary of the start of the Great War approaches . British soldiers then went out and . recovered 69 dead comrades and buried them. The impromptu football match . soon broke out between the two sides when a ball was kicked out from . the British lines into No Man's Land. To commemorate the game, and the war that followed, organisers arranged a complete day of events. When the tide came in, there was a short service by a . church leader from Saltburn as a lone bugler plays The Last Post. Silent Night, which was sung by German soldiers on the day of the truce football match, was also sung in both German and English. The event became well known after it was written about in Sebastian Faulks' war time book, Birdsong. The men, who were split in British and German teams as they were in the trenches, raised a truce flag at the event . A sea of 8,000 poppies were also laid to mark the fallen, while a Tiger Moth plane flew overhead, dropping 40,000 poppy petals to the crowds below . Silent Night, which was sung by German soldiers on the day of the truce match, was also sung in both German and English at the event . Allan Whiley told the Northern Echo: 'If the soldiers had continued playing football instead . of being forced back into battle perhaps a lot of lives would have been . saved not just in the First World War but the second one as well. We . want to commemorate the futility of war. 'We knew we couldn’t do this on Christmas Day, which is when the match . actually happened, so we thought we would hold it nearer the time of the . outbreak of the war.' Proceeds from the event, to be match funded by Barclays, will go to the . East Cleveland branch of the Royal British Legion who will use the funds . to restore Saltburn's War Memorial.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . and Jo Adetunji . A huge manhunt has been launched for Briton Gareth Huntley, who disappeared while trekking in remote Malaysian jungle almost a week ago. The British Government urged the country’s authorities to redouble their efforts after the family of the 34-year-old charity volunteer from London said the response had been ‘incredibly slow.’ His mother Janet Southwell had said she . feared her son may be injured and unable to move and called on Prime Minister David . Cameron to put pressure on the Malaysians to do more. Mother Janet Southwell with her son Gareth Huntley who has not been seen since he went on a trek to visit a waterfall in Tioman Island . Yesterday a professional search team . was deployed on the island of Tioman, including ten paramilitary . commandos, five police officers, three guides with search dogs, a fire . and rescue team, two boats and a helicopter. Mr . Huntley left the headquarters of the Juara Turtle Project, where he was . working, on May 27 to hike through the jungle. He told staff he would . be back that afternoon but failed to return. ‘We need boots on the ground, search teams and dogs so that we can bring our son back alive,’ Ms Southwell said. She has urged Mr Cameron to 'make one phone call' to the country's leader 'before time runs out'. Ms Southwell said 'real help' was needed to find Mr Huntley, who told . friends at the headquarters of the charity project that he would return . by 2pm the same day but failed to come back. Gareth Huntley, 34, went missing while trekking through the Malaysian jungle on Tuesday . Gareth Huntley, 34, from London, has not been seen since Tuesday morning on the island of Tioman . His mother wrote . to Mr Cameron: 'As a father, you know that we'd do anything for our . children and so I'm humbly asking that you make one phone call to help . my missing son, Gareth.' And . she added: 'Please do the right thing Prime Minister and make one phone . call to the Malaysian leader to insist that they deploy real help to . find Gareth before time runs out. He is out there in the jungle and he . needs help. Gareth, a charity worker from London, was trekking on Tioman Island, Malaysian, when he vanished .

We need boots on the ground, . search teams and dogs so that we can bring our son back alive. 'As our Prime Minister I write to you but as a mother too, I hope you'll help me.' She told Sky News that the police response had been 'incredibly slow'. She . said: 'The locals were, apparently, brilliant. They were out, very . quickly, looking, searching as best they could, through terrain which . they obviously know very well, but from what we understand the police . response was incredibly slow.' She . said it was out of character for him to go missing. 'He's got an . exploring nature, he's intelligent, and hopefully his ability to apply . himself will get him through this. 'He . was on a break from work, he was due to start a new job in Singapore . next week. It's totally out of character for him to go missing, he just . would not do it. He knows there are too many people who care and love . him.' Mr Huntley's girlfriend Kit Natariga has now arrived on the island, while his mother is also making the trip there. Miss Natariga admitted time to find him was 'running out'. She told Sky News: 'It's really tough coming onto the island, we're in a bit of a helpless state. We cannot give up... time is running out.' She said her boyfriend was an experienced backpacker and adventurer who would take utmost care in ensuring he was prepared for excursions. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'The Defence Secretary, who is in Malaysia, has spoken to the Malaysian Defence Minister this morning to confirm that all available search assets are used to find Gareth Huntley. The mother of a British wildlife volunteer is flying out to join the search for her son Gareth . 'He was assured that the Malaysian authorities would do all they could to locate him and had already deployed significant assets including dogs, boats and a helicopter. 'The Government will continue to work with the Malaysian authorities to ensure there is a comprehensive search.' The missing man's . brother, Mark Huntley, a 30-year-old web developer from Leeds, said: 'The media response has been hugely appreciated but we need real . action now to find Gareth. 'Gareth's . been missing now for five days and he's alone in the jungle. This was a . man working out there as a wildlife volunteer - he deserves our . assistance.' Fellow volunteer Charles .

The charity worker was in Malaysia as he was taking a break from work . They . checked various different routes to the waterfall 6km away that he might . have taken, while a further search the next day also proved fruitless. 'It's . a huge wilderness out there - a remote location. He could have taken a . wrong turn and just got lost in another valley' - Janet Southwell . Mr . Fisher added: 'Then the afternoon of the second day the police were . informed - they sent a couple of members of the police force along to . have a look but didn't go far or look very much - they were just sort of . assessing the situation. 'Then . the next day, the 29th, a group of volunteers went out and looked then . came back again. Another group from the local community also went out as . well and went deep into the jungle. The police were no longer . physically looking at that point - I think they were arranging for a . search party but nothing happened that day.

Stephane Dujarric said the convoy also carried in medicine for 15,000 people, and household items for another 10,000. Humanitarian aid has not been able to reach many areas where people are in need, despite a UN Security Council resolution in February demanding unfettered access. Now, Australia, Luxembourg and Jordan are planning to circulate a new UN Security Council resolution that diplomats say would authorise the delivery of humanitarian aid into Syria through four border crossings, without approval from president Bashar Assad's government. Currently, all UN aid must go through Damascus - a practice which has been repeatedly criticised.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Leon Watson . This playful bear clearly forgot his table manners when he was treated to a teddy bears picnic. The big friendly beast couldn't help rolling about on the tabletop as his keeper laid on an al fresco lunch. But, as the song goes, that is the way teddy bears have their picnics. The bear lives at an outdoor park with Sulo Karjalainen - known to many in his native Finland as 'the bearman'. Scroll down for video . Finnish bear man Sulo Karjalainen high-fives a playful bear at his sanctuary in Kuusamo, Finland . Sulo Karjalainen, who runs Kuusamo Large Carnivore Centre with his brother Jalo, is known to many in his native Finland as the 'bearman' Sulo Karjalainen comes nose to nose with a bear in Kuusamo, Finland . The 73-year-old runs Kuusamo Large . Carnivore Centre with his brother Jalo in the north of the country, . which has been home to more than 20 orphaned brown bears. He . was born in 1941 in Rovaniemi, but has spent most of his life on the . same farm in Kuusamo - seeing his first wild bear before the age of ten. 'If you're born in the woods, there's something of the animal in you too,' Mr Karjalainen said. 'People know me because of the animals. That makes me happy. When you've lived in the forest since childhood, you're naturally close to animals.' The bearman's family ran a dairy cattle farm - and in the absence of a babysitter, his mother was happy to leave her young son to play in the sheep pen, before picking him up in the afternoon. The family gave up farming after Finland joined the EU in 1995, at which point Mr Karjalainen  began working on a research project studying Finnish carnivores.

"By . Jennifer Newton . As the 70th anniversary of D-Day approaches one woman will be remembering the hero father she never met. Lieutenant Den Brotheridge was the first Allied soldier to be killed in action on June 6, 1944, which marked the beginning of the end of the Second World War. Back home his wife Margaret was eight months pregnant with their daughter, also to be called Margaret with the baby being born two weeks after his death. Mr Brotheridge, pictured with his wife-to-be Maggie, mother of Margaret, during the early 1940s . Lieutenant Den Brotheridge, the first soldier to be killed on D-Day after being shot in a gun battle . Mr Brotheridge, left, died before the birth of his daughter Margaret, right, who is now 69. She will be travelling to France to visit his grave as part of the 70th anniversary commemorations of D-Day . On Friday Margaret, now 69 from Honiton in Devon, will be among the millions commemorating the anniversary of D-Day, where more than 10,000 allied troops died. Mr Brotheridge was 29 when he boarded a glider across the English Channel and then gathered his men on a beach after crash landing. He then led the charge to clear enemy trenches at the Caen canal ridge but was hit in the neck during an exchange of fire. But his platoon still managed to capture two key bridges, with the Caen Canal Bridge later being named the Pegasus Bridge, after the emblem of the British airbourne forces. His daughter Margaret always knew that her father died but didn't realise the extent of his heroics and bravery until she was in her early 30s . Mr and Mrs Brotheridge, pictured in the early 1940s before the birth of their daughter, Margaret, who never met her father . Margaret and her mother Maggie, pictured, visited her father's grave in a cemetery in Ranville, France in 1994 . Ms Botheridge always knew that her father had died but it wasn't until she was in her 30s that she realised her father's bravery. In 1994 she visited his grave in Ranville in France and again this week she will be making the trip across the Channel to the cemetery. She told the Sunday Mirror: 'I'm so proud of my father, not just for his heroism but because he was a normal person. He was proud of his group of men and he led them from the front. He was one of them. 'I would have loved to have known my father. I'm so proud of what he did.' Also travelling to France for the commemorations is D-Day veteran Patrick Churchill, a member of a Centaur Tank that landed on the beaches that day. Patrick Churchill, a D-Day veteran will also be making his way to Normandy for the 70th anniversary commemorations . The 90-year-old returned to Normandy 10 years ago for the 60th anniversary of D-Day, where he was presented with the Legion D'Honneur, France's highest honour. Mr Churchill of Witney in Oxfordshire, who was serving with Number 4 Commando said: 'It does take you back and it takes me back to the time I saw these bodies. 'I learned later on what these were. Apparently the glider troops were going in just after Pegasus Bridge and the cable broke and they all went into the sea. 'Hitting the beach there were some dead Germans and I thought goodness gracious me - I was just thinking of their parents somewhere, that that could be me, and it might be me, and what would they think, and how would they feel?' 'History is the mainstay, you've only got to look through - it's something people should take more seriously because you will get these despots coming into power because of the ignorance of the people under them. That is what it is.' The landings were a turning point in the war, leading to the liberation of occupied Europe . Heads of states from 17 nations, including the Queen will also gather for an international ceremony in Normandy next week . Heads of states from 17 nations, including the Queen will also gather for an international ceremony in Normandy next week which will take place at the Sword Beach. For many veterans, now in their late 80s and 90s, who have made the annual pilgrimage to honour the 156,000 Allied troops, this year's events will be their last to the scene of their exploits. Also due to attend Sword Beach will be US president Barack Obama and also German chancellor Angela Merkel, in a sign of the harmony and friendship rebuilt since the horrors of the war. The day before the main international ceremony, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will travel to France for a three-day state visit, and will be received by French president Francois Hollande. On Thursday, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will meet veterans, including from the Glider Pilot Regiment, the Parachute Regiment and the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will also play a role by attending events in Arromanches on Friday. Allied troops land on the Normandy beaches during D-Day on June 6, 1944, marking a major turning point in the Second World War . On June 6, 1944, Allied forces, led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, on 'D-Day', beginning the liberation of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II. The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allies' assault on German-occupied territory. The mission was the largest amphibious invasion in history with over 160,000 soldiers, including 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadians, involved and over 5,000 ships. There was an initial airborne assault with 24,000 troops being parachuted into France before the sea landings began at dawn. The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah. The timing of the operation was crucial, with commanders needing the right weather, a full moon and the correct tidal conditions. On D-Day alone, around 4,400 Allied troops died with a further 9,000 wounded or missing. Total German casualties are estimated at between 4,000 and 9,000. The landings were a turning point in the war, opening up a second front - the Russians were already advancing on Germany from the east - and leading to the liberation of occupied Europe. 'The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory!' Eisenhower said in an historic address after the invasion was launched.","Lieutenant Den Brotheridge part of the platoon which captured two key bridges over the Caen Canal during D-Day .

Miss Crouch ignored security advice to avoid the old town and to wear her rucksack on her front. She tweeted: ‘First day in Ecuador ruined by someone slashing my rucksack with knife & stealing purse. Not a good start’ adding on her blog: ‘We started day with an hour stroll from hotel to British Embassy where the Ambassador was kind enough to meet us all and give us an insight into Ecuador, their political and military structures and how Britain trades with them. ‘Afterwards we went to the charming Old Town where unfortunately my rucksack was slashed and my purse was taken, without me or anyone in the group noticing. ‘Am trying to put a brave face on but am now without rucksack and credit cards for rest of trip!’ Miss Crouch is in Ecuador with six injured soldiers and fellow MPs John Mann (Lab) and Greg Mulholland (Lib Dem).

Tracey Crouch, David Cameron and Ffion Hague await a speech from Ffion's husband William Hague, the Foreign Secretary . Muggings and pick pocketing are common. In Quito, take particular care in ‘La Carolina’ and ‘El Ejido’ parks, the districts of ‘La Mariscal’, ‘La Floresta’ and ‘La Marin’, the old town including the central bus station, and ‘El Panecillo’ hill. Don’t wear expensive jewellery when walking around and watch your bags on public transport. Wear your rucksack on the front of your body. Where possible, don’t store anything under your seat or in the overhead storage. Keep your passport and money on you at all times. Take care of your belongings in restaurants or cafes and watch out for thieves. Criminals sometimes squirt liquids (ketchup, mustard, water, etc.) on you and then steal your bag while ‘helping’ to clean you up. Other methods of distraction include requests for assistance, staged fights and pushing or shoving. Don’t resist a robbery. Armed robbery is a constant hazard throughout Ecuador, but especially in Quito, Guayaquil and in remote areas. A British national was shot dead in February 2009 in Pedernales, in Manabi province, while undertaking conservation work. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to several parts of the country. Road conditions are variable. Heavy rains and mudslides often close or wash away roads, which can cause significant delays and accidents.Serious accidents are very common, mainly due to careless driving, speeding and badly maintained vehicles.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Gary Barlow's World Cup single Greatest Day has been removed from iTunes, reports today suggest . Gary Barlow's Greatest Day will not be England's official World Cup single, reports suggest. The single, which features numerous celebrities including singer Kimberly Walsh and footballer Michael Owen, was made available to download on iTunes in March. However the song, originally released as part of Sport Relief fundraising efforts, is no longer listed on the music buying site - with officials confirming there are 'no plans' to release it as a single. It comes just weeks after Barlow was exposed for sheltering money in a tax avoidance scheme. The singer was ordered by the High Court to pay back millions of pounds he sheltered in the £340million Icebreaker scheme earlier this month. The FA said that, although the song was endorsed by them, it was a Comic Relief production. A spokesman said: 'Although we have given our endorsement, it is very much their (Comic Relief) production and any release would be managed by them with all proceeds going to their Sport Relief charity.' A Comic Relief spokesperson told The Independent: 'There are currently no plans to release the version of Greatest Day shown on the Sport Relief 2014 night of TV as a single. 'The video will be available to view on YouTube during the World Cup.' It was understood the single was supposed to be released formally in June in the run up to the tournament.related] . The move may well mark the end of an official England song being released. In 2010, Fabio Capello banned a 2010 tournament single as he wanted everyone to be 'fully focused on the football'. Earlier this month, a tax judge ruled Icebreaker was not a genuine investment scheme. Consequently, Barlow, 43, his bandmates Howard Donald, 46, Mark Owen, 42, and their manager Jonathan Wild could be forced to pay £20million back HMRC. It is thought they put £66million into several Icebreaker partnerships, reportedly allowing them to shelter around £63million from the taxman. Barlow poses with Gary Lineker during an event for Sport Relief this year. The singer is thought to have sheltered millions in the controversial Icebreaker scheme . Other well-known names who have invested in Icebreaker include retired Olympic hurdler Colin Jackson, 47, former England football manager Terry Venables, 71, and businessman Nick Wheeler, who is the founder of Charles Tyrwhitt shirts. It is thought some of the investors have told HMRC they were misled into joining Icebreaker, and did not realise it was a tax avoidance scheme. The dropped single had not been particularly popular with fans - with David Baddiel, who sang the 1996 England anthem Three Lions calling the single 'a bit rubbish'. A number of other singles are now being lined up to take the title of England's official World Cup anthem. Come on England (Don’t Break My Heart) by Mansfield fans Mark Estell and Stephen Goalby is already on iTunes and is a hot favourite.

Though boys can be rowdy, their female classmates are 'meaner and smarter in their approach' - and deliberately target women teachers to demonstrate their dominance. 'Nightmare': Teachers claim popular girls, like the 'plastics' in Mean Girls, are manipulative and impossible to control . Targeted: Secondary school teacher Georgia Neale says she, like Tina Fey's character, is targeted by these girls . The claims appear to dispel long-held beliefs that girls have a calming influence on school life. Secondary school teacher Georgia Neale told the Times Educational Supplement: 'Boys are far more malleable. They are not perfect: the aggressive ones shout their mouths off and scarper, sometimes punching walls along the way. 'But girls are decidedly meaner and smarter in their approach.' She added: 'The queen bee will often try to use her top-notch position to undermine female teachers. 'It is difficult to teach a girl who feels you should be her subordinate, especially when said girl believes that complying with the most basic requirements would mean showing weakness in front of her friends.' Another female teacher said: 'Classroom management-wise, girls are an absolute nightmare for female secondary school teachers'. Manipulative: Teachers claim girls will do anything to stop female teachers dispelling their sense of power . In a 2012 report on gender and behaviour in schools, the Department for Education found boys aged 11 to 14 are far worse behaved than their female classmates. However, boys are more likely to admit when they have misbehaved than girls. Boys in that age group, the report stated, show a sharp surge in their displays of anti-social behaviour - such as verbal abuse and aggression. Meanwhile, a significant proportion of girls experience problems related to self-harm, depression and eating disorders.","Secondary school teachers describe 'difficult' popular girls in class .

Cindy Jackson, 58, pictured now, after her third 'Angelina/Kate' nose job, (l) and at 22, before any surgery (r) To create her perfect nose, Cindy, 58, travelled to Croatia where, she says, talented surgeons operate for lower fees. She took pictures of Kate Middleton and Angelina Jolie's noses and 'Photoshopped' versions of her own nose 'erasing the bridge and lifting the tip' to show the surgeon the desired outcome. After having the procedure last month, Cindy has now finally announced: 'This will be my last nose job.' The bill for her three nose operations amounts to £10,000. She had her first one when she was 34, deciding to replace her original nose - 'which she never liked'. But it failed to leave her looking 'any different' so she went under the knife again two years later to get a 'scooped' nose modelled on Nicole Kidman's.

The man heading investigations into alleged corruption surrounding the bid process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups will meet Qatari officials in Oman on Monday. The independent inquiry by FIFA’s chief investigator Michael Garcia has taken on extra significance after further claims over the weekend about the scale of secret payments that helped Qatar win the World Cup. Prior to the latest revelations, FIFA were hoping the New York lawyer’s report would have been completed before the start of the World Cup in Brazil. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke wanted a swift conclusion so there was no shadow hanging over the 2014 tournament which kicks off next week. Allegations: Mohammed Bin Hammam is at the centre of the claims, with FIFA investigating the 2022 World Cup . Hosts: Qatar held off competition from Australia to win the rights to host the 2022 World Cup . But there now seems no hope of that happening as documents obtained by the Sunday Times have thrown the world governing body into chaos. The newspaper claims that Qatari Mohamed bin Hammam, the former FIFA vice-president, used slush funds from 10 private  company accounts to make  dozens of payments in return for votes. The allegations include: . On Sunday, calls for a re-vote came from within FIFA’s own organisation, with vice-president Jim Boyce saying he would support such a move should corruption allegations be proven. In an interview with the BBC, Boyce said: ‘I would have no problem if the recommendation was for a re-vote. ‘If Garcia reports that wrongdoing happened for the 2022 vote then  it has to be looked at very seriously.’ Reserving judgement: FA chairman Greg Dyke says if corruption allegations are proven the 2022 bidding process needs to start again . Rivals: Bin Hammam (right) tried to run against Sepp Blatter (left) for FIFA president but withdrew following allegations of bribery . FA chairman Greg Dyke said: ‘Some of this  evidence, on the face of it, is quite compelling. If the evidence is there that the process is  corrupt, then obviously the process has to be looked at again.’FIFA’s communications department directed all media enquiries to Garcia and ‘the office of the chairman of the Independent Ethics Committee’. Qatar’s World Cup bid committee issued a statement. It said: ‘Following today’s newspaper articles, we  vehemently deny all allegations of wrong-doing. We will take whatever steps are necessary to defend the bid’s integrity. The right to host the  tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the Middle East to host its first FIFA World Cup.’ But the Sunday Times report claims 65-year-old Bin Hammam was lobbying on Qatar’s behalf at least a year before the decision to award the country hosting rights. Bribes: Former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner (left) and Bin Hammam (right) faced allegations of bribery surrounding the 2011 FIFA presidential elections . FIFA: Bin Hammam (left) and Blatter (right) at Doha airport in 2010 . In the past Qatar, and indeed FIFA, have insisted any such activity by Bin Hammam has centred around his attempt to secure votes for the 2011 FIFA presidential election, when he intended to stand against Sepp Blatter. He withdrew before the election. Back in July 2011 Bin  Hammam was banned from football for life after being found guilty of  bribery. The ban was annulled a year later by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which said there was insufficient evidence to support the punishment. But FIFA then issued a second life ban in December 2012 for ‘conflicts of interest’ while acting as president of Asian football. The latest allegations still fall short of exposing any FIFA executive  committee members requesting cash or favours in exchange for votes. But John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: ‘There have already been serious doubts raised about the capability of Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup on football grounds. If the choice of Qatar was as a result of improper payments being made, then that strengthens an already strong case for re-running the whole 2022 contest.’ World Cup?

Under pressure: Wayne Rooney, who arrived in Miami with England on Sunday night, faces calls to be axed from Roy Hodgson's starting line-up . Pain game: Luis Ramirez winces after coming off worse in a challenge with Wayne Rooney on Friday night . On their way: Wayne Rooney arrives at Luton Airport as England began their journey to Miami . Plenty to ponder: Hodgson named a strong team, including Rooney, for the final game on home soil before the World Cup . With 27 goals in 38 games for club and . country, he has forced Roy Hodgson to hand over the No 9 shirt and play . him in the centre, nearest the goal, rather than out wide as he has in . the past. This means finding . somewhere else for Rooney to operate. It ought not to be a problem. He . can simply play off Sturridge, in the No 10 role, or even alongside him . in (whisper it) something like a 4-4-2 formation. For . a long time, Rooney’s best position was thought to be off the main . striker, between the lines of midfield and attack. But in general his . most productive games for England, since Euro 2004, have been as a . centre forward. He has . enjoyed two purple patches: one under Fabio Capello in qualification for . the 2010 World Cup, often playing alongside Emile Heskey, and another . since Hodgson took over, with 10 of his 38 international goals in 16 . games under the current manager. Sturridge,  however, is not conducive . to strike  partnerships. Ruthless: England coach Gary Neville has spoken about not playing the best players but the best team . Even . at Liverpool this season, where he and Luis Suarez have been brilliant, . Sturridge had a better goals-per-minute ratio without the Uruguayan. In . the last two England games, he has come alive, seemed freer, using the . space left once Rooney has been replaced — after an hour against . Denmark and after 66 minutes against Peru. Do . they inhibit each other? Does Hodgson sacrifice Rooney to get more from . Sturridge, who is four years younger? At 28, this could even be . Rooney’s final World Cup, playing as he does in a young man’s position. Does . Hodgson persevere with them together?  Should England use their two . friendlies in Miami, against Ecuador on Wednesday and Honduras on . Saturday, to work on a better understanding and improve Rooney’s . match-sharpness? Friday’s . 3-0 win against Peru was Rooney’s first game in more than a month. Although he worked hard and looks in superb physical condition, he may . appreciate another chance to play and refine his touch; perhaps  even . find his first international goal since October. All aboard: The England squad have flown to Miami to continue their World Cup preparations . Yet to make a mark: The 28-year-old hasn't scored for England at a World Cup and time could be running out . ‘Our . plan on Wednesday is basically  to start the people who didn’t start on . Friday,’ said Hodgson. ‘That would be the plan, but plans like that . sometimes go astray and I’m not prepared to make any promises.’ The . argument is complicated by the emergence of others. Adam Lallana’s . international career has started with promise, while Hodgson is fond of . Danny Welbeck’s pace. Against . some of the better teams at the World Cup, particularly against Italy . in the opening game when possession will be crucial, there must be a . temptation for Hodgson to clutter the midfield with three specialists — . Steven Gerrard, Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson, for example, with . wingers either side and one up front. Alternatively, . Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley are capable of playing in the hole . behind the main striker in a  4-2-3-1 shape. It is where Sterling played . when he first came on for Rooney against Peru. Looking up: Wayne Rooney skips past Josepmir Ballon as England launch an attack . ‘It . would be stupid for me to say on the basis of just a few minutes that . this is Raheem Sterling’s best position,’ said Hodgson. ‘I’m not even . certain I necessarily want Raheem to have a best position. ‘I . want him to be able to play in the position where we need him. On . Friday, we thought it would be good to bring him on initially in the . position behind the front player, where we’ve seen him play well. ‘But . then we wanted to bring Ross Barkley on, so we moved him wide and he . did OK there. I’m sure he’s going to be a very big player going forward, . but I would rather see some of these younger players treated with a . little more caution.’ Hodgson . warned against an obsession with Rooney but the mere fact this debate . is open is encouraging for England. Normally these tournaments are . preceded by heaping pressure on his shoulders to carry the nation . through. This time there is . an option to use him tactically: send him out for an hour without being . afraid to haul him off. It might even be a way for him to be more . effective, although it will be a brave move by Hodgson, with no way of . knowing how he might react to being left out. It . is not a question of discarding him, it is about getting the best from . him. Rooney will be a key weapon for  England at the World Cup.","Daniel Sturridge has earned the right to be considered England’s centre forward .

I was driving myself mad thinking about whether I should go to Chelsea or not,’ he has recalled of that time.

Danny Welbeck (Manchester United) Club interested: TottenhamEstimated value: £15m . On Sunday, as England’s World Cup squad arrived in Miami for the second phase of their preparations, this familiar issue was dominating the agenda again. At least four England players — vice-captain Frank Lampard, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Rickie Lambert — are involved in decisions over their club futures. Which brings us to head coach Roy Hodgson and his claim that ‘when we’re together, it’s England and purely England and we’re not going to combine the two things’. Already the lines are blurred. The clubs should be showing the national team more respect ahead of the World Cup. England is all that should count. Hodgson has banned agents from the team hotels, but he is well aware that the players’ mobile phones will be buzzing when they retire to their rooms. There is already some wriggle room, though, and Hodgson will let players have medicals during their seven-day stay in Miami. Lampard’s £150,000-a-week contract with Chelsea expires on June 30 and a move to Major League Soccer is under consideration. He has an offer from Chelsea for another season and manager Jose Mourinho wants the midfielder to start his coaching badges. At 35, Lampard is equipped to handle the situation better than most, but it is still a distraction as he prepares to captain England against Ecuador in the Sun Life Stadium here in Miami on Wednesday. Focus: England boss Roy Hodgson will have to keep his players' minds on the job in hand despite transfer rumours . Uncertain: Southampton pair Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw are being linked with big-money moves . Then there is the Southampton Three. Lambert’s move to Liverpool for a knockdown £4m is almost complete. He was given permission by Hodgson to travel to Merseyside on Saturday for a medical and the transfer is expected to be completed today. Lallana played on with a groin strain in the final two matches of Southampton’s season because he was so desperate to say goodbye to the supporters. His heart is set on a move to Liverpool (Lallana was an Everton fan growing up) to play Champions League football. There is much to discuss but he has been made aware Brendan Rodgers intends to play him in a role behind Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez next season. London bound? Fraser Forster has been linked with a move to Tottenham . Linked: Danny Welbeck is another player being mooted to join Maurico Pochettino at White Hart Lane . Shaw, the junior member of the England squad, is expected to leave St Mary’s for Manchester United after the World Cup. What counts for England is getting all four to focus on international football. That, as Gerrard illustrated at Euro 2004, is easier said than done.","England captain Steven Gerrard remembers possible £50m move to Chelsea distracted him during Euro 2004 .

"By . Mike Dawes . Japan's Hideki Matsuyama won the Memorial Tournament in a play-off with Kevin Na after a dramatic final day at Muirfield Village. Na was in early at 13 under after a superb eight-under-par 64 and waited for around 90 minutes while the other leading challengers fell apart on the closing stretch. Overnight leader Bubba Watson dropped out of contention altogether after shedding three shots on the 14th and 15th holes of the Jack Nicklaus-designed course. Company: Jack Nicklaus presents Hideki Matsuyama with the trophy after he won the Memorial Tournament . Matsuyama almost followed, requiring birdie at the last - after breaking his driver - to finish alongside Na and force a play-off. Both players made a terrible mess of the extra hole, with Matsuyama's tee-shot - with a wood, having not replaced the damaged club - finding sand before Na drove into the creek on the left of the fairway. Na then missed right while Matsuyama struck a spectator on the other side, but the Japanese player produced a superb flop on and holed out for par and victory. Delight: Matsuyama celebrates his close victory at Muirfield Village in Dublin, Ohio . Fight to the finish: The Japanese needed a play-off to see off the challenge from Kevin Na . The 22-year-old told Sky Sports: 'I'm just happy. This is a dream come true to win at Mr Nicklaus' golf course, it couldn't be better.' Earlier, Na came from off the pace with the help of birdies at all four par fives in a tremendous bogey-free round. He revealed he had been inspired by Nicklaus, part of the commentary team for American network CBS, claiming on Saturday night that the players seven shots back were still in contention. 'I was watching TV and when he said five under had a chance, I thought 'really?',' he told the same network. It was a battle but I thought I did very well. It's a hard golf course, I know the guys are tearing it up but we all know it's not easy.' Well done, son: Matsuyama is congratulated by golf legend Nicklaus . That was proved several times over in a madcap final hour. Watson started well by holing a 34-foot birdie putt from off the front of the first green and picking up another shot at the fourth after an excellent tee shot. But he failed to make the most of the two par fives on the front nine, with his birdie putt on the seventh sliding just past. Matsuyama opened with two birdies, the second via a hole-out from a greenside bunker, and after dropping a shot at the next he birdied the fourth from 15 feet. Back-to-back birdies at seven, where he hit his 89-yard approach within tap-in range, and eight took him alongside Watson, who dropped a shot at the ninth but birdied the next two to regain his lead. Matsuyama hit a wonderful approach to the 13th, just skirting over a bunker, to set up birdie but gave the shot back at the next to leave Watson alone in front once more. The Masters champion, though, also slipped up at the 14th to drop back to 14 under and then, looking for birdie on the long 15th, hit a bafflingly wayward tee shot out of bounds into a neighbouring garden as the madness set in. Faltered: Bubba Watson was on course for victory in Ohio before a final round of 72 . Leading the charge: Paul Casey was the highest placed Englishman, finishing tied for 13th on seven under . He found the fairway at the next attempt but surprisingly laid up from around 250 yards and eventually took seven - and as Matsuyama double-bogeyed the 16th via the water, Na was suddenly sharing the lead again and duly headed to the practice ground. Watson narrowly avoided the same hazard but could only make par, and Matsuyama dropped another shot at 17 to leave Na in front on his own. With players figuratively losing their heads, Matsuyama took it to a literal extreme after a poor drive at the last by slapping his driver on the ground and breaking the head off it. But he regathered himself and, after a marvellous approach, birdied the hole for the fourth time this week to make the play-off. Watson was one shot back after narrowly missing the last green and failing with an audacious chip. World No 1 Adam Scott shared fourth place with Chris Kirk, having gone out in 32 but come home in 39. The Australian birdied 11 to share the lead but found water at 12 and though he partially recovered from that double bogey with a birdie, three successive bogeys dropped him out of contention. Kirk shot 68, finishing birdie-eagle-birdie-bogey, and sixth place was shared by Steve Stricker and Ben Curtis at nine under. South African Charl Schwartzel finished in a group at eight under and produced arguably the shot of the day, holing an outlandish flop from creekside rough at the 11th for birdie. England's Paul Casey was seven under and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy a further shot back after finishing an eventful tournament with a level-par 72. Watson's playing partner Scott Langley, who was just one stroke off the lead overnight, faded with a seven-over 79 to finish four under - but provided another of the highlights of the day when his birdie putt at the 16th oscillated on the lip of the hole for more than 20 seconds before dropping in to raucous cheers.","Japanese wins in a play-off at Muirfield Village .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Malcolm Glazer's death at the age of 85 has, among other things, prompted the question, 'What role will his children now play at Manchester United?' While Glazer Snr led the takeover of the club in 2005, since 2006 he has left the day-to-day running of the club to his sons - indeed, he has never set foot in Old Trafford. Avram, Joel and Bryan Glazer are regularly seen at the ground but the other three, Kevin and Edward and their sister Darcie Glazer Kassewitz follow their father's 'lesser spotted' policy. Getting the Glazers in: Avram (right), Bryan (left) and Joel (second left) at Old Trafford just after the 2005 takeover . The Glazer family own 90 per cent of United - all split equally with 10 per cent listed on the New York Stock Exchange. That means Kevin, Edward and Darcie could have more involvement at Old Trafford now - indeed, they could have the future of the club in their hands. It is unlikely they would want to sell their shares, given the strong family bond. United are insisting it is business as usual but the death of the family head could affect how the sextet run the club. Taking Stock: Joel Glazer (third left) and Avram (third right) with United officials in New York in 2012 . The two most high-profile Glazers are Avram and Joel, the executive co-chairmen. Avram is the oldest of the six children and headed . the United takeover in 2005. He and his brother Joel have been prominent figures ever since, taking . over the day-to-day running of the club in 2006 after their father had a . stroke. They had the final say on the appointment of new . manager Louis van Gaal. Joel is also actively . involved in the running of United, speaking to Ed Woodward up to three . times a day about all aspects of the club. Passed away: Malcolm Glazer (right), pictured with sons Joel (left) and Bryan in 2005, has died aged 85 . Of the other powerbrokers at United, Woodward is the most prominent. He joined Manchester United in . 2005 when he acted as an adviser in the Glazer family’s controversial £790million takeover and was invited to join the club soon afterwards. Woodward was initially involved in United’s financial planning before being handed responsibility for the club’s commercial and media operations in 2007. Woodward became a director in 2012 and . played a key role in United’s £1.37billion flotation on the New York . Stock Exchange in August of that year. It was no surprise therefore that . he was chosen to replace chief executive David Gill when he stood down . in June, although Woodward retained his existing title of executive . vice-chairman and remains based at the club’s London corporate . headquarters. Holding the keys: Ed Woodward (left) and United group managing director Richard Arnold . Family affair: Avram (left) and Joel Glazer are joint executive co-chairman at United . Sir Alex Ferguson will always be an iconic figure at United and . was instrumental in choosing David Moyes as his . successor as manager and was part of the panel which picked Van Gaal. The most successful boss in United's history was a frequent presence at matches last season as the club recorded their worst Premier League finish. It will be interesting to see whether he is spotted at Old Trafford as regularly now Van Gaal is in charge. Ferguson's close ally David Gill is United’s former chief executive and remains an influential figure on the . club’s football board. It is . thought by some observers that United made a mistake by letting him . leave the same summer as Ferguson and it has turned out that way. Gill was also consulted about Van Gaal's appointment. The legend: Long-serving boss Sir Alex Ferguson still holds power at Old Trafford despite his retirement . Richard Arnold, the group managing director, was promoted from commercial director in the shake-up . that saw Woodward replace Gill in 2013. He is the most senior figure at Old . Trafford on a day-to-day basis and together with Woodward, has trebled United’s commercial revenue over the course of the . next seven years, closing deals with major sponsors all over the globe. Sir Bobby Charlton is, of course, a Manchester United legend, who became a director in 1984. Charlton was a key figure in Ferguson’s appointment in 1986 . and continues to be a respected voice on team-related affairs.

The female was described as being of Asian appearance, in her early to mid teens and was wearing a light-coloured, collared shirt and a dark blue v-neck jumper. The man driving the car was Caucasian, in his late 50s or early 60s, wearing a blue singlet, with a tattooed left arm and a 'rock and roll styled hairdo'. 'The witness stopped at the traffic lights next to the car and found the scenario 'odd', according to police. Police are now investigating information Bung was spotted in the rear passenger seat of a white EA to EF model Ford Falcon station wagon on Boronia Road between 8.30am and 9am on June 2 . Police said the car was sighted at traffic lights in Boronia Road, facing east at the intersection of Floriston Road, just east of Dorset Road. It was then seen travelling east along Boronia Road and continued straight through the roundabout at Albert Road. Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter said that while investigators have not been able to confirm the girl in the car was Bung, it's a lead police are desperate to follow up. 'The sighting may well be completely innocent, but it is relevant to us and we need to investigate it,' Det Insp Potter said. He said police had known about the car sighting for some time, but had chosen to publicly release it on the third anniversary of Bung's disappearance to jog people's memories. 'It’s now been three years since Bung left home and failed to arrive at school that day and has not been seen or heard from since,' he said. Monday marks the third anniversary of Bung's disappearance. She was last spotted wearing her blue and white school uniform when she disappeared . More than 1,000 homes were door-knocked and at least 1,200 leads closely examined as police tried to solve the mystery. But Taskforce Puma, which was set up four months after her disappearance, was shut down last year as the leads dried up.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Australia's biggest cities could become a new project for the woman who transformed New York's Times Square and overhauled the Big Apple's transport network. Former New York City transport commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan wants to re-design roads to enable them to become social 'living roonm' instead of being clogged thoroughfares. Speaking at Adelaide's Velo-Cities conference, Ms Sadik-Khan said the way we think of streets needs to change, recommending Australian cities install more cycle paths and bike-share programs. Former New York City transport commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan, pictured, recommends Australian cities implement more bike paths and bike share programs . Her role as transport commissioner saw her overhaul how New York's footpaths were used and breathe life back into the city by eliminating traffic and creating an environment that encouraged more people to walk. Despite the success, at the time extensive cycle path networks were rolled out and the bike share system was introduced, they were viewed as controversial, according to the ABC. 'Our streets are where we play and meet, kind of like the living rooms of New York, and so when you change something like that it can cause a stir,' she said. Sydney has approved plans to close George St to traffic so light rail can be implemented and a large plaza in front of Sydney's Town Hall be created. When Ms Sadik-Khan proposed closing Times Square there was massive concern, with businesses and theatre-owners anxious and worried as well as general scepticism from the public. Despite her controversial plans, Ms Sadik-Khan has helped transform New York's Times Square . But she continued with her plans, supported by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and went on to transform Times Square in the middle of his re-election campaign. Creating streets that make it easier to get around and also make the city more attractive for businesses and residents is a key economic-development strategy for the city. At the end of their terms last December, Ms Sadik-Khan and Mr Bloomberg cut the ribbon on the finished Times Square project. 'It's gorgeous and it is really worthy of its name: the crossroads of the world,' she said. Ms Sadik-Khan said data proved the renovation worked with retail rents near Times Square tripling, six major retailers opening and Times Square is now rated as one of the top 10 retail locations in the world for the first time. Transformation: In approved plans, George Sydney will be closed to traffic and a plaza created in front of Sydney Town Hall, pictured, in the heart of the city . But Ms Sadik-Khan said it was not all smooth sailing and that implementing the massive changes saw her become a target of the press and said reading the tabloid papers was not 'fun'. But New York now has a network of predominately separated paths covering and connecting the all of the city's boroughs. It has has privately operated bike share program, albeit reportedly facing financial problems, which operates with an annual membership and is available to tourists. Light rail will reduce congestion by replacing cars on George St and making it pedestrianised . Ms Sadik-Khan said roads need to be thought of as social 'living rooms' The Don't Be a Jerk safety campaign features some of the city's most famous comedians, models and chefs riding bikes in a bid to encourage cyclists to respect their fellow riders. But the former transport commissioner said leadership at a local level is where she sees most of the innovation in urban design taking place. 'It's interesting to see that the innovation that you see in cities like Sydney, Adelaide and Auckland and in New York City ... it's the cities that are innovating,' she said. She said it was common to not see funding and policy guidance at national (federal) level. Ms Sadik-Khan is now an adviser to a national transportation association that develops cooperative approaches to key transportation issues. Part of the former transport commissioner's strategy for implementing plans was to act quick . Speaking about the Times Square project, Ms Sadik Khan said families with kids would be crunched onto fire hydrants and that even parking signs were complicated. She acted quickly, temporarily closing sections of road and car parks and marking where a new plaza might be built. The plans, including curb lines, were painted all over the city and Ms Sadik-Khan added the key was to change the use of a space quickly so people could see what it looked like. She did this in areas where residents and business wanted public space and if anyone did not like it, it could be changed it back. Despite initial fears form businesses and the public, Ms Sadik-Khan said Times Square was flourishing .","Former New York transport commissioner has assessed Australian cities .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Ultramarathon burns victim Turia Pitt has opened up about how her life has changed since the horrifying moment she nearly lost her life and revealed why she hasn't returned to scene of the bushfire that left her with burns to nearly two-thirds of her body. Pitt, who became trapped in a bushfire while running an outback marathon in Western Australia in 2011, this week won a multi-million-dollar settlement and says she's now finally ready to move on with her partner. 'I don't need to put any pieces together - I know what it was like, I was there,' she told 60 Minutes on Sunday night. 'It's like if you have a nightmare, do you want to have that nightmare again?' Scroll down for video . Turia Pitt and her boyfriend Michael Hoskin say they are feeling happy again and now share a deeper connection . Moving forward: Ms Pitt said she does not need to return to where the ultramarathon fire happened, because she already had closure . Ms Pitt has been awarded a reported $10 million out-of-court settlement from Hong Kong-based ultramarathon organisers Racing The Planet . Ms Pitt reunited with three other victims of the 2011 bushfire, who she considers close friends, and the rescue team who saved their lives in the Kimberley outback. The survivors were all competing as one team in a 20-kilometre swim in Lake Argyle, the first time they had all returned to the area since the fire. While the other three victims returned to the spot in the Western Australia Kimberley Region gorge where they faced the blaze, Ms Pitt said she had already moved on and did not need to see it again. 'They (the other victims) wanted to do that and that's good for them if it helps them move on, but I've already got closure,' she said. Ms Pitt also revealed how her long-term boyfriend Michael Hoskin has supported her throughout her recovery and into a new chapter of her life. 'There's a lot of positive things that have happened,' Ms Pitt said. 'I think we all have that inner strength inside of us, but we just never get tested, so we never get the chance to discover how incredible we all are.' Three of the ultramarathon fire victims including Kate Sanderson, pictured together, returned to the gorge where they faced the blaze in the Western Australia outback . The 26-year-old, pictured left in 2007 before suffering her horrific injuries, still leads an active lifestyle. She is pictured right hiking in the Whitsundays in April this year . Ms Pitt and her boyfriend said they were now enjoying life again, with Mr Hoskin adding they had endured a tough couple of years. 'There's a lot of messages that you can get out of my story and one of them is having a positive relationship with your partner,' Ms Pitt said. 'My relationship with Michael before the fire was on a totally different level, because we were just young, we were boyfriend and girlfriend, we'd just moved in together - life was perfect, seemingly perfect.' But Ms Pitt said she believed she now shares a deeper connection with her partner. 'I've found out just how strong I really am,' she said. The 26-year-old has also taken on the role as a motivational speaker sharing her story of survival and also discussing body image as she has recovered. 'I'm incredibly fortunate to have found my partner Michael,' she told a group of school students. 'He loves me exactly how I am.' Ms Pitt, pictured with her boyfriend Michael Hoskin, received burns to 64 per cent of her body when she became trapped in a bushfire in Western Australia's Kimberley Region . Do you want to have that nightmare again? After visiting the Kimberly Region with the other victims, Ms Pitt did not return to the gorge where they were trapped by the bushfire . Speaking about body image, Ms Pitt said she felt like people had only valued her because she was good looking. 'Not because I'm smart, gritty, determined - we are all so much more than our bodies,' she said. On being question about her strength and courage, Ms Pitt said she did not consider herself that inspiring. 'I'm just living life to its fullest and that's what everyone should do,' she said. Ms Pitt has been awarded a multi-million-dollar settlement from event organisers Racing The Planet. The former model and another runner, Kate Sanderson, suffered burns to more than 60 per cent of their bodies after they became trapped in a bushfire while running an outback marathon in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia in 2011. The Supreme Court action was settled out of court for a reported $10million. The MailOnline understands the settlement amount is significantly less. The rescue team and the survivors shared an emotional reunion three years after the fire . Ms Pitt (right) with her boyfriend (left) and helicopter pilot Paul Cripps (centre) who rescued Turia in 2011 . Mr Hoskin said it got settled through mediation and the couple were glad the process was over. 'You can’t really speak about whether it was a good or great outcome, there's no winners, it’s just an outcome you know, but it’s really good to have that behind us now, so we can move forward,' he said. 'We don’t even have to think about that ever again.' When asked if she felt that she can now let go, Ms Pitt said 'Yeah I think so yeah'. She added that psychologically it was a good thing. 'Yeah of course it’s a good thing. I mean I can move on.' With her compensation case settled, Ms Pitt is due undergo further surgery including rebuilding her nose. But the surgery has been put on hold for a few months, with Ms Pitt and her partner focusing on learning their yachting skills, which they plan to use as they sail around Tahiti. The victims of the ultramarathon fire reunited and met with the rescue team, including the pilot of the helicopter which saved them . Ms Pitt faced the ferocious blaze in a gorge of the Kimberly Range in Western Australia . The bushfire which injured competitors including Ms Pitt in the ultramarathon in Western Australia's Kimberley region in 2011 . Ms Pitt launched the court action in February last year after a WA parliamentary inquiry found Hong Kong-based Racing The Planet did not take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of competitors. Ms Pitt's lawyer Greg Walsh said she had shown enormous courage and dignity. 'I'm very relieved and happy for her and (her boyfriend) Michael (Hoskin) that this matter has now come to an end,' Mr Walsh told the West Australian. 'She will be left with horrific injuries for the rest of her life but at least she won't have to put up with the stress and worry of a protracted court case.' In 2012 Ms Pitt and Ms Sanderson, 38, were awarded $450,000 by the WA government as an 'Act of Grace'. Western Australia Tourism Minister Dr Kim Hames said that the money was to 'assist in alleviating their financial stress while they explore other options.' Ms Pitt and her partner are preparing to sail around Tahiti before the 26-year-old undergoes further surgery . The 26-year-old threw a fundraiser cocktail party earlier this month to raise money for Interplast, an organisation that provides free reconstructive surgery for people in developing countries . Ms Pitt, who was working in mining engineering when she entered the marathon race, told a 2012 inquiry that she wasn't even planning to enter the event because she thought the entry fee was ridiculous. But two weeks before the marathon on September 2, 2011, she was invited by organisers to compete for free. She was joined in the event by adventure enthusiast Ms Sanderson and 40 other runners who were destined to run across the parched outback Kimberley region of north west Australia. But part-way through the race Ms Pitt and Ms Sanderson, along with two male competitors, became trapped by a bushfire in a narrow, rocky gorge. The former model launched a Supreme Court action against Racing The Planet in February last year after a damning WA parliamentary inquiry . Ms Pitt's injuries were so bad that not only did she suffer burns to 64 per cent of her body, she also had four fingers from her left hand and her right thumb amputated. Ms Sanderson had to have her left foot amputated, lost part of her earlobes and part of her right index finger. They told the inquiry earlier they had no idea they were running into danger because the organisers had spoken only 'in passing' about spot fires. Ms Pitt said she and Ms Sanderson would have died at the gorge if not for a risky rescue mission undertaken by a helicopter crew. Ms Pitt pictured before a recovery operation earlier this year .

"By . Daniel Mills . A delusional killer, who claimed he was told by a 'computer god' to strangle his girlfriend four years ago, will never face trial over her death because of his unfit mental state. Rhys Blake Austin, then 22, admitting to killing 22-year-old mother Bianca Faith Girven in 2010 by strangling her for more than 10 minutes inside a van at Mt Gravatt, Brisbane. The motivation for the attack, he said, was fueled by a belief that a computer god told him to kill his girlfriend so that he could too progress along the path of becoming a god. Austin, who has paranoid schizophrenia, also said he was on a 'mission to kill' before carrying out the attack. Scroll down for video . Unsound of mind: Rhys Austin will not stand trial for killing his girlfriend back in 2010 . The admissions, made months after her death, lead a Mental Court Hearing to throw out the murder charge against him on the basis he exhibited severe psychotic symptoms.

The decision means Austin will not face trial over Ms Girven's murder, despite an unsuccessful appeal by the Attorney General's Department which argued his admissions proved he planned the murder. The Court of Appeal heard Austin, who initially told police a false story, admitted to killing Ms Girven 14 months after her death on March 30, 2010 and nine months after his arrest. Chocked: Bianca Girven was chocked to death in the back of a van in 2010 . They came after he initially told police the pair were in his van at a carpark near Mount Gravatt lookout when someone dragged Ms Girven from the vehicle and he was hit in the head. Prosecutors alleged he told the psychiatrist how he had semi-planned the killing and thought he should strangle her. The Court of Appeal also heard he told how his hand hit her in the face and he went behind her and put her in a choke-hold for about 10 minutes, only releasing her when she stopped breathing. Austin, then 22, panicked and drove her to his ­parents’ place. The appeals court, however, upheld the initial ruling in the MHC ordering the proceedings against Austin be discontinued and no further taken against him for acts ­constituting that her Ms Girven's death.","Court upheld decision to clear Rhys Austin of murder, despite admissions .

"By . Emily Crane . Melbourne University's Vice-Chancellor Glyn Davis has estimated fees are likely to soar as he outlined the impact of the government's planned 20 percent reduction in funding in an email to staff on Friday . Student fees will double for some degrees at leading universities under the federal government's controversial overhaul of higher education. Fees at Melbourne University will need to rise by up to 61 percent in some courses to manage budget cuts, while the University of Sydney is looking at double the cost for some arts degrees and a 55 percent increase for engineering and science degrees. Melbourne's Vice-Chancellor Glyn Davis estimated fees were likely to soar in an email to staff on Friday as he outlined the impact of the government's planned 20 percent reduction in funding. 'Initial analysis shows the gap (caused by reduced public funding) is momentous indeed - fees would need to rise by 45 per cent to make up lost funding in social science disciplines, by 54 per cent in Science, and by 61 per cent in Engineering,' the email said, according to the Age. 'The budget has significantly changed the allocation of public money across disciplines. There are some winners – mathematics and humanities – and many losers.' A bachelor of science degree with a civil engineering major costs a minimum of $24,082 based on current fees, but that would rise to at $38,772. An analysis of the cost implications from budget cuts show similar predictions for the University of Sydney with communications, social science, environmental and engineering degrees at least doubling, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . Fees at Melbourne University (pictured) will need to rise by up to 61 percent in some courses to manage budget cuts, while the University of Sydney is looking at a 55 percent increase for several degrees . A bachelor of environmental systems currently costs a minimum of $25,839 but students could be faced with a $42,405 bill from 2016. Communications students who now pay about $18,132 would pay about $37,000 under the changes. In an interview last month with Fairfax Media, Professor Davis said Melbourne University would not increase fees to charge the maximum amount possible and said he found parts of the budget 'distressing' despite his support for fee deregulation. 'The only reason I am for fee deregulation is because both sides of politics have showed us they aren't prepared to do enough public funding,' he said. An analysis of the cost implications from budget cuts show communications, social science, environmental and engineering degrees will double at the University of Sydney . Prof Davis said he was concerned about the 10-year government bond rate – a long term interest rate. 'It's a much higher rate of interest. It starts earlier and it will compound over time, which means that students will be paying back higher fees for longer… And that's very disappointing,' he said. The changes to higher education were announced in the Abbott government's recent budget, which will allow universities to set their own tuition fees from 2016. But Education Minister Christopher Pyne has rejected claims that the government's proposed rejig of university funding will drive up course costs for students. Institutions that price themselves out of the market will have empty lecture theatres and tutorials, Mr Pyne said. 'Competition will drive prices down and students will be the winner in terms of quality and price,' he told ABC TV on Sunday. Mr Pyne said some 200 universities across Australia will have to remain competitive in the education market and doesn't foresee an explosion in fees. Despite the cost, students will still be able to borrow every single dollar from the government 'at the lowest interest rate that student will ever see in any loan they will ever have in their lives'. Students enrolled in courses before the budget announcement will not be affected by the change, while those who have signed up since will be affected from January 2016.","Fees at Melbourne University to rise by up to 61 percent in some courses .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Joshua Gardner . The firestorm sparked by Gwyneth Paltrow's remarks comparing online hackling of celebrities to being in a war raged on Friday as a member of the U.S. Army special forces slammed the actress in a sarcastic column. Green Beret Bryan Sikes addressed the recently separated star of Shakespeare in Love in the form of a personal letter, which appeared on the site Clash Daily run by conservative commentator and author Doug Giles. ‘I'd first like to start out by saying how terrible I feel for you and all your friends that on a daily basis have to endure mean words written by people you don’t know. Not amused: Sgt First Class and Green Beret Bryan Sikes (left) wrote a sharply phrased letter calling out actress Gwyneth Paltrow (right) for her controversial remarks . Hero: Sikes, 28, was awarded a Purple Heart after being wounded in an IED explosion while serving in Afghanistan in 2008 . 'I can only imagine the difficulty of waking up in a 12,000 square foot Hollywood home and having your assistant retrieve your iPhone, only to see that the battery is low and someone on twitter (the social media concept that you and all of your friends contribute to on an hourly basis to feed your ego and narcissistic ways), has written a mean word or 2 about you.' Sgt First Class Sikes continued in this derisive vain, suggesting that Paltrow, 41, should 'receive a medal' for enduring verbal abuse online at the hands of 'meanies.' Paltrow was outside Los Angeles at Re/Code's Code Conference speaking to Silicon Valley executives Tuesday when she made the offhanded remark drawing a comparison between cyberbullied celebrities and soldiers in a war zone. Family man: Sikes, who is married and has two children, wrote that unlike Paltrow and other celebrities who have nannies and life coaches, military wives have to do everything on their own . 'It's a very dehumanizing thing. It's . almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanizing thing, . and then something is defined out of it. My hope is, as we get out of . it, we'll reach the next level of conscience,' she told the audience. Sikes, a Purple Heart recipient, hit out at Paltrow, calling her 'insecure and mentally weak' for comparing his own and other service members' devastating experiences on the battlefield to her life of comfort and leisure - an assertion he described as 'dehumanizing.' A military mom's wrath: Cindy McCain, wife of ex-POW Senator John McCain and mother to two soldiers, has come out swinging over Gwyneth Paltrow's suggestion that actors ridiculed on the internet are like soldiers at war . In 2008, Sikes was injured in Afghanistan in an IED explosion. In his letter, he talks about seeing his friends get killed and lose limbs in firefights. ‘Let me be the first to burst your bubble: a long line at Starbucks, your driver being 3 minutes late, a scuff mark on your $1200 shoes and a mean tweet do not constitute difficulty in the eyes of a soldier,’ he wrote. Sikes, 28, of Florida, is married and has two children. He noted that unlike celebrity wives and mothers who have a team of consultants, nannies and life coaches to help them run a household, military wives have to do it on their own. Sgt Sikes was not the only on to attack Ms Paltrow for her questionable comments. Cindy McCain, the wife of former POW John McCain and the mother of two soldiers, called Paltrow 'a joke' on Twitter. 'Her life is like taking bullets for a soldier. What a joke! My 2 sons serving in the military should talk to her,' Cindy MCain stated. Not holding back: McCain's tweets came after Paltrow's comments while speaking at a tech conference. She's was surprisingly uncensored for a politician's wife . It was a small part of what she said while sharing a stage with tech CEOs, but was more than enough to infuriate the war hero's wife. Arizona Senator and former presidential hopeful John McCain was was taken as a prisoner of war as the third generation naval officer served as a pilot in Vietnam in 1967. Senator McCain's plane was shot down by friendly fire and he would eventually spend five and a half years as an horifically abused prisoner before coming home to receive the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Hear and Distinguished Flying Cross military honors. Cindy McCain on Wednesday offered up a helpful suggestion to the Country Strong actress and self-styled lifestyle guru. 'Perhaps . Gwyneth Paltrow should go out on patrol with some soldiers. Kind of . like a Red Carpet in her mind I guess!' she tweeted. While the Goop founder's appearance at the conference was a reaction to malevolent online attacks on her and her famous friends, any good it could have done has likely now been erased. Which is nothing new for the recently single Paltrow. A . week before news of her 'conscious uncoupling' from husband Chris . Martin broke, the 41-year-old infuriated working women across America . when she said they had it easier than famous acting moms. Family affair: McCain's fury was fueled by the fact that her sons John (left) and James (with McCain at right) are both military men . She had her reasons: John McCain, pictured here with Mrs. McCain at an Arizona Diamondbacks game this month, was an horrifically abused prisoner of war in Vietnam for five and a half years . 'I think it's different when you have an office job, because it's routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening,' she told E! 'I think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as, of course there are challenges, but it's not like being on set.' Many women were put off by the comments, but none as famously as mother Mackenzie Dawson who made headlines with her open letter to Paltrow published in the New York Post on March 27. 'Thank God I don’t make millions filming one movie per year is what I say to myself pretty much every morning,' is one of many zingers in Dawson letter, which no doubt helped put the normally aloof Paltrow on the defensive. On May 8th, she responded to the anger over her working mom comments with a Goop in which she drew a different sort of parallel with armed combat. Co-parent: Gwyneth's estranged husband Chris Martin - who she recently separated with after 11 years of marriage - returned to Los Angeles on Thursday, where they still share a home together . In the post titled Ending the Mommy Wars, Paltrow wrote: . 'Why do we feel so entitled to opine, often so negatively, on the choices of other women? As the mommy wars rage on, I am constantly perplexed and amazed by how little slack we cut each other as women,' she wrote. For her part, Cindy McCain used Thursday's whirlwind of publicity around her attack on Paltrow to help publicize a good cause. 'Happy . to have joined @MikeGalanosHLN @HLNNowTV to chat about . #humantrafficking and Gweneth Paltrow crazy statement,' McCain tweeted. Spreading the word: McCain tweeted about Paltrow's comments repeatedly in what appeared to be her attempt to make sure the off-handed comment did not go unnoticed .","Paltrow made the comments during a surprise appearance at a tech conference outside Los Angeles on Tuesday .

"By . Sally Lee . It was once the scene of a brutal double murder of two brothers who were stabbed to death in their home. Now this Sydney property is worth $2,265,000, after selling more than $200,000 above its reserve on Saturday with many potential buyers who were unfazed by its grim history. The four-bedroom modern home went under the hammer for the first time since the cold-blooded attack five years ago. The Sydney house, where two Frisolli brothers were murdered in 2009, sold for $2,265,000 on Saturday . The newly-renovated freestanding property has separate living areas, cathedral ceilings, timber floors, alfresco dining and a self-contained studio at the back. The house in Sydney's inner west was one of almost 900 auctions yesterday, which marked the second biggest auction day of the year so far, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. The former home of brothers Albert and Mario Frisoli, slain in 2009, was purchased by a Byron Bay buyer. Property developer Albert Frisoli and his brother Mario Frisoli were killed by Giuseppe Di Cianni. Brothers Albert (left) and Mario (right) Frisoli were stabbed to death at their home by Giuseppe Di Cianni . The four-bedroom modern home went under the hammer for the first time since the cold-blooded attack five years ago . Mr Di Cianni and Albert Frisoli had been in business together for several years before the murderer believed he was being defrauded. During his trial, the Supreme Court heard that Mr Di Cianni disguised in women's clothing and entered the Frisoli brothers' home. He first stabbed Mario 21 times then waited two hours for Albert and killed him too. Mr Di Cianni was sentenced to 30 years in jail last September. His former lover Josephine Pintabona was also sentenced to at least three years for being an accessory after the fact of the killings. It was a slow start to an opening bid of $1.9 million but three registered bidders took the the result well past the $2.05 million reserve at the on-site auction . 10 groups showed active interested in the property at 17 Goodsir Street, Rozelle but three walked away from the sale once they heard about its tragic history . The property was sold by Mario's daughters, Albert's children and his de-facto partner Natasha Kourea . There were 10 groups who showed active interested in the property at 17 Goodsir Street, Rozelle. However three walked away from the sale once they heard about its tragic history while the other seven were undeterred by its past and six contracts were issued, according to BresicWhitney agent Adrian Oddi. Although it was a slow start to an opening bid of $1.9 million, three registered bidders took the the result well past the $2.05 million reserve at the on-site auction. It would have been marketed at $2.2 million-plus if the house had not been a crime scene. The Byron Bay buyer was on the phone and represented at the auction by a BresicWhitney agent. The property was sold by Mario's daughters, Albert's children and his de-facto partner Natasha Kourea. 'In spite of the… tragedy that occurred at Goodsir Street, we still hold some very happy and memorable moments there,'  Mario's daughters Shannon and Erica said earlier this week. 'The home was full of fun and laughter, and pranks and games, and meals and discussions, and just normal family stuff, and we hope that whoever is lucky enough to secure the home - that it will give them lots of happy memories.' As part of the material fact law, all prospective buyers of the Rozelle house were told about its history  once they showed interest. In this instance, details were also included on the contract of sale.","The four-bedroom home in Rozelle, Sydney's inner west, sold for $2,265,000 on Saturday .

The students were brought back to the lab to rate the faces again after either a day, three days, seven days, or three months had passed.

"By . Louise Cheer . A Nambour mother was dragged out of the family car and had her top teeth smashed in by a stranger who was enraged by slow service at a McDonald's drive thru - right in front of her children's eyes. Leigh Barham was treating her two boys, aged four and eight, to Happy Meals on Australia Day 2011 when Troy Shane Kuskopf started his unprovoked attack on the family from his car. Kuskopf, who was sentenced to two years' jail, was not present when the magistrate handed down his sentence at Maroochydore Magistrates Court on Friday. After the verdict was handed down, Ms Barham told The Courier Mail the assault had left her so terrified she avoided fast food drive-thrus and was constantly locking her car doors. A man has been jailed for attacking a woman while her children were in the car, because the drive-thru was taking too long at McDonalds . Ms Barham said the drive-thru was full and nobody was moving when Kuskopf got out of his car and started abusing the family, including the children's grandmother in the driver's seat, while they were placing their order. The man spat on one of the car's windows and kicked a tyre before the family left the fast food chain. The family made their way down Currie St - one of Nambour's main roads. They had driven about 100m down the road when Ms Barham's son spotted Kuskopf behind them and yelled out: 'He's coming.' Ms Barham's mother drove another 600m to the service station when they had to stop at a red light. 'We just didn't want to drive through it and hurt somebody else,' Mr Barham said. 'And he came up right behind us. I thought he was going to ram us, but he pulled up inside of us, just reefed my door open and pulled me out of the car, smashed me in the face a few times. 'My son was at the window and he punched my son’s window and just threw me on the ground.' Leigh Barnham had to fork out over $3,000 for dental work following the brutal attack . After the attack, Ms Barham needed $3,000 worth of dental work, including a new plate in her upper jaw and false top teeth. On Thursday, the court heard Ms Barham's children, who were aged four and eight at the time of the attack, experienced bet wetting and sleeping problems for months because they were so traumatised. The pair spent a year obsessively checking the doors and windows while driving in the car. Ms Barham, who was depressed and stressed, ended up quitting her job as a youth worker that she studied three years to get because she could not deal with the demands of working with troubled teenagers. The family had to attend sessions with psychiatrists after the incident and Ms Barham is on anti-depressants. Police prosecutor Sergeant Nick Nitschke appealed to the court to hand Kuskopf the toughest sentence because he had fled the scene, evaded police, failed to show at court and did not offer an early plea. Magistrate Simon Young said the road rage attack was 'disturbing and serious'. Condemning Kuskopf's actions, Magistrate Young said the man had shown no remorse for what he had done and had not even bothered to show up at court for his hearing or sentencing. He ordered the 37-year-old's arrest who will be eligible for parole in eight months. The man was also told to pay $1,000 in restitution to Ms Barham.","Troy Shane Kuskopf assaulted the mother-of-two at Nambour McDonald's .

Cats have long been renowned for their ability to land on their feet, and now a new documentary will show exactly how the pets manage to hold onto their nine lives as they twist and turn on their way to the ground. Images filmed on a high-speed camera show how a cat's body will perform four manoeuvres in mid-air, including stretching out their legs to transform their bodies into a living parachute. Safety: Images filmed on a high-speed camera show how a cat's body performs four manoeuvres in mid-air, including stretching out their legs to transform their bodies into a living parachute . As part of new ITV documentary The Secret Life of Cats, the animals were filmed in a studio as they were dropped from a height of around 10ft . Slowed down, the footage shows how a . cat will first straighten up so its body will eventually be parallel to . the ground, turning on its head and then its tail. It will then spread all four limbs to slow its fall and as it nears the ground, the cat will extend its claws to give it a good grip when it lands. Finally the tumbling animal will flex its back to minimise any shock from landing. Sir Patrick Bateson, emeritus professor of ethology at Cambridge University and president . of the Zoological Society of London, said that a cat's legs give the . animal air resistance which enables its body to spin around faster. 'They . stick out their legs so that provides greater inertia, so that when . they turn the body the bits that are sticking out don’t turn so . rapidly,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 'Then they repeat that with the other set of legs.' Instinct: By the time a kitten is seven weeks old it will have already developed the instinct needed to survive a fall, known as the 'righting reflex' According . to the documentary, which airs tomorrow night, by the time a kitten is . seven weeks old it will have already developed the instinct needed to . survive a fall, known as the 'righting reflex'. Sir Patrick said that one of his cats, Nelly, had fallen behind a wardrobe when she was a kitten, breaking her pelvis because the space behind the cupboard was too small for her to fully turn. 'She is fine now, but it was a clear demonstration of how if you prevent the animal turning and sticking its legs out, it cannot do the whole operation,' he said. In 2012 it was reported that a one-year-old cat called Sugar had fallen 200ft from a nineteen storey window in Boston, USA, with just a bruised chest. And a 1987 study of 132 cats taken to a vet in New York after falling from high-rise buildings revealed that 90 percent of them survived and one 37 percent required emergency treatment to save their lives. One animal which fell 32 storeys survived with a chipped tooth and a collapsed lung, and was allowed to go home after just 48 hours. Using new filming techniques to show cats as many of their owners will never have seen them before, the documentary also reveals remarkable stories including how one cat saved a couple from a gas explosion and the surprising relationship between a blind Labrador and the feline friend who acts as his guide. One cat who features in the show is Basil, who turned up on Sue Roff’s doorstep unexpectedly 16 years ago. Remarkable tails: The documentary also reveals remarkable stories including how one cat saved a couple from a gas explosion and the surprising relationship between a blind Labrador and the feline friend who acts as his guide . Basil’s acute sense of smell prevented a potentially fatal accident for Sue and her husband one night in 2011. 'I’d done dinner, my husband had gone up to bed. I’d cleaned the cooker and then went up to bed,' said Mrs Roff. However, she had accidentally left one of the gas rings on and asleep upstairs, neither she nor her husband could smell the leaking gas. The pilot light on Sue’s central heating was due to switch on soon, and that would ignite the gas. But as cats have a sense of smell 30 times better than that of a human, to Basil the smell of gas was intense and dangerous. 'At about 1.30am he came on the bed, patted my face and I pushed him away,' said Mrs Roff. 'An hour and a half later he came back, he was much more insistent. He came back and patted my face with one little claw. Then I knew there was something wrong. I could smell something unpleasant; it literally filled the whole house. He could have literally just walked out the cat flap outside, but he didn’t. If he hadn’t have woken me up, it would have just gone kaboom. I’m really proud of him, he is my hero.' The programme also tells the surprising story of the relationship between a blind dog, 14-year-old Labrador Terfel, and his best friend, a cat called Pwditat. Terfel had been thrown against a wall as a puppy, causing his blindness, but Pwditat has been able to act as his guide cat. 'Terfel is much more confident when Pwditat is around,' said owner Ann Cragg. 'He relies on him to avoid bumping into things. Often when they’re out, they’re nose to tail. Pwditat in the lead and Terfel following him.' Secret Life of Cats will be broadcast on ITV at 9pm on Monday June 2.","A cat's body performs four manoeuvres in mid-air and acts as a parachute .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . and Jessica Jerreat . New York is home to many stars, but it's only four times a year that its biggest sets right between the east-west streets of Manhattan's grid and turns almost all who cross its path into a paparazzi. Manhattanhenge, sometimes referred to as the Manhattan Solstice,  was scheduled to occur at 8:16 on Thursday night and a group of disappointed New Yorkers gathered to take a photo of the glistening sun. But while the sun and the grid system were perfectly aligned, the weather was not - with clouds blocking out the event. It wasn't until Friday night that onlookers were able to experience the magical moment where cosmopolitan meets cosmos at 8:19 p.m. Hundreds of people gathered all over Manhattan to witness the Manhattanhenge on Friday night . New Yorkers did everything they could to take a perfect photograph of the rare New York occurrence . The sun sat perfectly aligned behind buildings during the Manhattanhenge occurrence Friday night . The sun was radiant and in perfect view on Friday night as hundreds gathered to capture its rays . As the sun began to set completely, it did so amidst the sparking city lights that make New York 'the city that never sleeps' Some photographer attempted to take a post-modern approach to capturing the rare occurrence on Friday when the skies were clear . The term Manhattanhenge was coined in . 2002 by Neil deGrasse Tyson and is an amalgamation of Manhattan and . Stonehenge, the ancient English monument built in accordance with the . sun's path, explains Wordsense. The best . viewing on Friday night was along 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd and 57th streets, and along . both the Empire State and Chrysler buildings. In . a good year, Manhattan-henge lights up the city skyline with a burst of . red and orange and Friday nights spectacle was far more resilient than . the obfuscated sunset the night before. Earlier in the day on Thursday, the forecast looked . promising with clear blue skies, but as sunset drew close at 8.15pm - . and eager spectators lined the city streets - clouds obscured the sky. 'The setting sun aligns precisely with the . Manhattan street grid, creating a radiant glow of light across . Manhattan's brick and steel canyons,' Neil deGrasse Tyson, of the American Museum of Natural History, told USA Today. The spectacle lights up every cross street in Manhattan and is 'a unique urban phenomenon in the world, if not the universe', he added.

"By . Bianca London . She may have cut ties with Ultimo but that doesn't mean Abbey Clancy is quitting the day job. The model and Strictly Come Dancing winner has today unveiled her new designs for Matalan - and models them all herself, of course. Proving that she is more than just a pretty face, the mother-of-one, who is currently sunning herself in Dubai, designed the range from scratch based on her personal style. New range: Abbey Clancy stars in Matalan's SS14 campaign - and she designed it all herself! Following the success of her AW13 collection, 28-year-old Abbey was invited back by Matalan to design a summer dress collection. Fashion fans will know that Abbey has a penchant for monochrome, so she's based her range around that - but added some exciting pops of citrus orange to brighten up the colour palette for summer. The eight-piece dress collection includes fun minis with neck detailing and illusion black panels around the middle. Looking good! Abbey designed the range of summer dresses and co-ords herself based on her favourite colours (outfit, £40) The range, which bears some striking similarities to Victoria Beckham's SS14 collection, is full of plenty of flattering pencil skirt dress . styles with hero pieces featuring mesh shoulder detailing as well as . figure-hugging silhouettes with delicate spaghetti straps. Speaking about her new collection, which is mostly priced at £40, Abbey said: 'I am really excited about my new collection, and cannot wait until it lands in store. 'I love orange this season and feel it works perfectly across the smart pieces and more flirty fun dresses. Shapely: Abbey has included plenty of flattering dress styles with figure hugging silhouettes aimed to accentuate the female figure . Excited: Speaking about her new collection, Abbey said: 'I am really excited about my new collection, and cannot wait until it lands in store' Abbey's new collection comes at just the right time for the footballer's wife. She and Michelle Mone have reportedly become embroiled in a cat fight dubbed 'bra wars' after the Liverpudlian posed in her underwear for brands Veet and . Scholl. As a result, she is no longer the face and body of Ultimo, the firm Michelle owns. On Monday . morning, Michelle tweeted: 'Re:today's reports,unfortunately we had . exclusivity issue with Abbey's mgmt, she's a great girl. We look forward . to releasing her last campaign.' Look familiar? Abbey seems to have taken inspiration from Victoria Beckham's range of dresses, but at least Abbey's are 36 times cheaper that Victoria's, which cost around £1,400 . Tanning session: Abbey and husband Peter Crouch are currently sunning themselves on holiday in Dubai . A . source told The Sun's Dan Wootton: 'It has all kicked off between Michelle and Abbey and . we're calling it bra wars. Abbey is only two-thirds of the way through . her contract, but it is clear the relationship between them has . completely broken down. 'Michelle was unhappy about the picture of Abbey in her knickers for Veet. But Abbey is adamant she's done nothing wrong.' Representatives for both women said: 'Each party have decided to to terminate the contract due to creative differences.' Abbey first became an ambassador for the brand in December 2013, when she replaced Michael Buble's wife Luisana Lopilato. The Abbey by Abbey Clancy' collection will be available online and in selected stores nationwide June 4.","Abbey, 28, has designed range of summer dresses for Matalan .

"By . Katy Winter . While it doesn’t require you to spend your days in reflective prayer, the latest diet regime to hit the spotlight does recommend that followers mirror the eating habits of the Greek Orthodox monks of Mount Athos. The religious men eat a Mediterranean diet made up almost exclusively of unprocessed, fresh, low-fat foods, and also engage in days of fasting where they drastically reduce their calorie intake to clear their minds. The monks are obviously doing something right as they have been found to live an astonishing 10 years longer than the average Greek person and also tend to be slim and youthful. The monasteries of Athos are among the world's healthiest communities. The monks live very long lives, largely free of cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's . Outlined in a new book, The Mount Athos Diet by Richard Storey, Sue Todd and Lottie Storey, the plan aims to eliminate the concept of ‘dieting’ and instead splits the week into three types of  day; three moderation days, three fasting days and one feasting, which can be moved around each week to adapt to lifestyle. During the three fasting days you cut out all dairy, fish, meat, alcohol, eggs and oil, sticking to small portions of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and beans. As well as promising a host of health benefits the Monk Diet claims to produce weight loss without a feeling of deprivation . The moderation days allow you a healthy, fresh, low-fat, Mediterranean diet. Dairy, olive oil, fish, chicken and eggs can all be included, although sugar, processed foods and red meat are still off the menu. Alcohol is even allowed on these three days - though only red wine in moderation (2 units a day) is allowed. The feast day is, as it sounds, a free-for-all, where anything from red meat to cake, mojitos and chocolate is allowed - though the diet does recommend a modicum of restraint in terms of portion size. Breakfast: Bircher muesli breakfast pot . Lunch: Chicken soup with toasted wholemeal pitta . Dinner: Baked sweet potato with olives and feta and green salad . Snacks: An apple, a handful of nuts or seeds . Breakfast: Grilled grapefruit . Lunch: Vegetable soup with a small piece of wholemeal bread . Dinner: Baked butter beans with fresh tomatoes and lettuce . Snacks: Unlimited vegetable sticks . Breakfast: Grilled peaches with Greek yogurt . Lunch: Carrot and coriander soup . Dinner: Chicken salad with Greek yogurt dressing and a glass of red wine . Snacks: Square of dark chocolate, fruit and vegetable sticks . Breakfast: Muesli . Lunch: Lentil soup . Dinner: Jacket potato with kale and carrots . Snacks: Small bowl of berries, nuts and seeds . Whatever you want – within reason! The three days can be placed in any order to make your life easier. The book explains: ‘Studies have shown that the monasteries of Athos are among the world’s healthiest communities. The monks live very long lives, largely free of cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s. Their way of eating also carries with it an enticing by-product: natural weight loss. ‘The monks don’t count calories, nor do they suffer any of the deprivation commonly associated with the ‘fad’ diets of the Western world. Theirs is not really a ‘diet’, more a way of life. 'They eat good food and drink good wine, and by following age-old principles of using wholesome ingredients, eating in moderation and exercising regularly, they are among the fittest and healthiest people on earth. ‘Each monastery is largely self-sufficient and very little produce is bought in from the mainland. The monasteries are surrounded by kitchen gardens, orchards, vineyards, beehives and olive groves, and everything produced is organic and seasonal; much time-consuming effort is required to nurture  crops and maintain the maximum possible output from the land. 'Monastery meals are an extension of the daily religious observance, occurring twice a day – morning and evening. 'Meals are consumed in silence, as the monks listen to the daily readings from the scriptures (with occasional interruptions from the Abbot).’ Richard Storey, one of the authors of The Mount Athos Diet, who has visited the monks every year for 15 years, spoke to MailOnline about how he came to the conclusion that their eating regime would be beneficial for everyone. 'The monks are deemed to be amongst the healthiest group of people in the world, with very low cancer rates and almost no Alzheimer’s and after years of living among them I recognised their diet had a large part to play in this,' Storey told MailOnline. 'I always came back feeling fitter, healthier and having lost weight, but I never felt like I had been deprived. 'We recruit numerous people to test out the monk’s diet to see if it was applicable in a normal Western life. I lost 22lb everybody lost weight . 'A key thing we found was that the lack of calorie counting was a large relief. 'We also found that somewhere along the way, usually at the three or four week mark, you realise that, without any pressure being placed on exactly calories, you are eating differently and what you crave on the feast day changes. ‘Most people no longer even want the highly-processed, high-sugar foods they did at the beginning.’ The Mount Athos Diet by Richard Storey, Lottie Storey and Sue Todd (Vermilion, £10.99)","The monasteries of Athos are among the world's healthiest communities .

"By . Katy Winter . When asking a father for his daughter's hand in marriage, the worst scenario most young men are likely to encounter is a grilling by their potential father-in-law. But when Jake Thompson asked for Steve Bennett’s daughter Hannah’s hand at Christmas, he got more than he bargained for. Steve agreed on the provision that Jake accompanied him on a planned charity trek to the North Pole. Jake Thompson (l) asked Steve (c) for his daughter Hannah's (r) hand in marriage at Christmas . Steve and Jake embarked on an epic 10 day trek which saw them walk, ski and sledge to the North Pole in temperatures of -50 degrees Celsius . Jake and Hannah have been together since they were childhood sweethearts . Having been childhood sweethearts with Steve’s daughter Hannah and determined to marry her, Jake, 23, who lives with Hannah in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire had no choice but to agree. So, last month, he found himself jetting out to the 89th latitude (the last degree) along with Steve, who lives in Redditch, before embarking on an epic 10 day trek which saw them walk, ski and sledge to the North Pole in temperatures of -50 degrees celsius. Guided by Alan Chambers, the first Briton to walk unaided to the North Pole, the team successfully navigated their 100kg sledges through the moving ice of the Arctic Circle. Steve Bennett, CEO of Birmingham based jewellery company The Genuine Gemstone Company is proud of his business’s family routes. Steve and Jake formed half of the only British team expected to make it to The North Pole this year, battling through temperatures as low as -50 . As well as being initiated into the family, Jake helped raise in excess of £30,000 for the Colourful Life Foundation and National Osteoporosis Society . Steve rather humbly says of his amazing trip: 'It will be a great story to tell our future children!' So much so, that he felt this latest venture, in the name of charities The Colourful Life Foundation and National Osteoporosis Society would be the perfect initiation into initiation into the family. Speaking about his decision to recruit Jake to the challenge, Steve said: 'This seemed to be the perfect opportunity for Jake to prove his commitment to marrying my daughter! 'But on a serious note, it's a great challenge for a great cause. I needed someone I can rely on during those dark and difficult moments and Jake proved to be the man to accompany me.' Jake added,'Hannah and I have been together for eight years so I didn’t think there would be any objection from Steve. 'When he told me, I panicked but there was no way I was going to back out. And it’ll be a great story to tell our future children!'

The results come through in 30 minutes at the centres where you can walk-in or book while other clinics have doubled of the amount of testing in the past 18 months. The data shows a pop-up clinic at Mardi Gras this year tested a higher proportion of men with high-risk sexual behaviours and found HIV in two per cent - double the average rate. NSW is on the right track towards eradicating HIV with pop-up centres such as this clinic on Oxford St in Darlinghurst in March .

The highest proportion of gay men in nearly 20 years are now getting tested for HIV,  with many attending the pop-up centre on Oxford St during Mardi Gras .

"By . James Slack, Home Affairs Editor . Twice as many Britons die from a drugs overdose, compared with the rest of Europe, a new report has found . The UK death rate from so-called ‘legal highs’ is twice the European average, it emerged today. Experts also warned that the rate at which new drugs are flooding the market continues to rise. A total of 81 new psychoactive substances were reported for the first time in 2013, up from 73 the previous year, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) said. Europe’s Early Warning System, a detection mechanism described as the ‘first line of defence against emerging drugs’, is struggling to cope with the rate at which new synthetic drugs are emerging. There are fears the drugs are being produced at such an alarming rate that doctors, who have never encountered the substances, do not know they have been responsible for a person’s death. This could mean the true scale of the problem is even worse. Already the UK’s average mortality rate due to overdose was 38.3 per million population, more than twice the average for Europe at 17 per million. According to separate figures, submitted to coroners, ninety-seven people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009. It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years. Yesterday, charities also said an upsurge in legal highs was fuelling crime. A quarter of people currently on an offender rehabilitation programme in London had been using the substances prior to arrest. In its European Drug report 2014, the EMCDDA said the total number of legal highs available across the continent has now soared past 350 substances. Some 651 websites selling legal highs to Europeans were identified by the agency as it warned the open sale of the designer drugs online has increased availability to distributors and consumers. The rise of legal highs has made it increasingly complicated to assess and identify drug-induced or drug-related deaths, the EMCDDA said. The report warned: ‘Most overdoses occur among individuals who have consumed multiple substances, and attributing causality is often problematic. ‘With the continuing release of new psychoactive substances on the drug market, there is concern that new or obscure substances that have contributed to deaths may escape detection.’ Yasmin Batliwala , chair of drug rehabilitation charity Westminster Drug Project (WDP), said: ‘ In the first quarter of this year, 26 per cent of clients on our offender rehabilitation programme indicated that they were using ‘legal highs’ prior to arrest. 'This is a very significant proportion and indicates the rise of ‘legal highs’. ‘ . Experts also warned that the rate at which new drugs are flooding the market continues to rise. A total of 81 new psychoactive substances were reported for the first time in 2013, up from 73 the previous year . Earlier this month, a report by the United Nations warned that legal highs have seen an 'unprecedented expansion' in Britain in recent years , with one in ten admitting they have tried the drugs. Researchers found new types of drugs are being detected at the rate of two a week, leaving police and drug agencies struggling to keep up. Figures showed that 8.2 per cent of Britons questioned in 2011 had taken so-called designer drugs. Only Ireland (16.3 per cent), Poland (9 per cent) and Latvia (8.8 per cent) had a higher rate. The Home Office last year launched a review of legal highs to look at how the country’s laws can be improved. Options include the expansion of legislation to ensure police and law enforcement agencies have better tailored powers. The Government banned two groups of psychoactive substances in December- NBOMe and Benzofuran compounds - as class A and B drugs respectively. Elsewhere in the report, the EMCDDA said heroin use and availability was in decline, with the number of first-time entrants to specialist drug treatment for heroin problems falling from a peak of 59,000 in 2007 to 31,000 in 2012.","European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drugs Addiction released its annual report revealing 81 new 'legal highs' first appeared last year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . One in five people have admitted they would pull out their own teeth, risking infection and other complications, because they can’t afford to go to the dentist. The British Dental Health Foundation has issued a stark response to the findings, warning about the 'senseless' examples which have seen people pull out the wrong tooth and end up with infections as they resort to using doorknobs and string to yank out painful and infected teeth. In the last two years 56 per cent of the population have had a dental examination – with a large proportion of patients avoiding trips to the dentist because they are worried about the spiralling costs of treatment. Danger: 20 per cent of people say they would resort to DIY dentistry to avoid paying for a dentist . •          Chewing on toffee•          Car accidents •          Having a potato thrown at their head•          Horse riding acccident •          Being hit in the face with plank of wood•          Playing rugby •          Problems with a crown becoming loose •          Falling down the stairs •          Bicycle accident •          During a diving accident •          Tooth breaking while eating . (Source: British Dental Health Food Association) A survey of more than 2,000 people by the British Dental Health Foundation revealed 17 per cent would remove the tooth themselves, and four per cent would opt for asking a friend to do so. Almost 80 per cent of people responding to the survey said they would leave a problem with their teeth until they could afford to go to the dentist. Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation, said: ‘DIY dentistry is both dangerous and unnecessary.  There are too many senseless examples of people either pulling out the wrong tooth or ending up with an infection. 'It is all too easy to make the problem worse, which could result in more invasive and expensive treatment, so I urge those considering self-treatment to think again.’ In the last two years around 69 per cent of children have been seen by an NHS dentist, but this has slightly decreased since 2006. Experts believe the number of people visiting their dentist could rise with the introduction of ‘direct access’, where patients can now see a hygienist or therapist without having to see their dentist first. Under the new scheme hygienists and therapists can do fillings and other procedures, improving patient access to dentists and possibly reducing waiting lists. Worry: In the last two years, 56 per cent of the population have had a dental examination, with a large proportion of patients avoiding trips to the dentist over cost fears . Dr Carter added: ‘Direct access allows . more patients to be seen sooner, so long gone are the days where . somebody should be tempted to use a doorknob and a piece of string to . remove a tooth.  In no circumstances should anybody resort to performing . any kind of dental work themselves.’ The survey was commissioned by the British Dental Health Foundation ahead of National Smile Month, and aimed to assess the attitudes towards oral health across Britain. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) show 39 million patients visited the dentist in the two years up to the end of 2013 – which represents 56 per cent of the total population. In 2013 the British Dental Health Foundation estimated that businesses lost more than £36 million to people taking time off work because of problems with their teeth.","Dental experts have warned that DIY dentistry can cause infections .

"A couple who faced the four devastating miscarriages have become parents for the first time... to quadruplets. Grace Slattery, 31, gave birth to three girls and a boy on Monday morning, with husband James by her side. Mr Slattery, already dubbed the 'Quad Father' by friends, faced a race against time to get to the hospital after his wife went into labour earlier than expected. But thanks to the gardaí (the Irish police force), the father-of-four made it to his wife's side, after police officers gave him an escort from the couple's home in Limerick to the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin. Grace Slattery gave birth to three girls and a boy with husband James by her side at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin in the early hours on Monday . Mrs Slattery had been due to have a C-section on . Tuesday, but shortly after midnight on Monday, she called her . husband to say her waters had broken. The father-of-four called his parents, who gave him a lift. En route, Mrs Slattery suggested calling the gardai, who accompanied Mr Slattery to the hospital, giving him time to run to the operating theatre for the arrival of his daughters and son at 3.54am. Born at 32 weeks and six days, the quads ranged in weight, from the biggest, Amelia Helen at 4lbs 3oz, to the smallest Mollie Rose weighing 2lbs 15oz. The pair were born within minutes of each other, along with their brother Lucas James, weighing 3lbs 10oz and sister Lily Grace May, weighing 3lbs 4oz. Mr Slattery told the Mirror: 'My parents picked me up, I got in the car and we headed to Dublin, and we rang to see what they (the gardai) could do for us and they literally gave us an escort all the way to the Rotunda, and I literally ran in the door and I just made it in time. Mr Slattery was given a police escort from the couple's home in Limerick to the hospital in Dublin facing a race against time to make the birth of his four children Amelia, Mollie, Lucas and Lily. The couple conceived naturally after suffering four miscarriages in four years . 'I didn't think it would happen at all. They were brilliant.' Despite his frantic rush to the hospital, when Mr Slattery arrived, his wife was calmly preparing herself for the arrival of her quads. The new arrivals were much longed for, with the couple facing four devastating miscarriages in the last four years. Mr Slattery said they had their children naturally, despite rumours they might have had IVF treatment. 'Things haven't been great for the last four years, especially on Grace, things have been tough on her. 'We had made our minds up, that after the . fourth (miscarriage) we wouldn't go again and then we changed our minds . and we said we wanted to try once more, and it was natural.'","Grace Slattery gave birth to three daughters and a son with husband James at her side at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin on Monday .

The condition causes intracranial pressure, which can lead to persistent headaches, blurred vision and other symptoms . ‘When Harry was born in January 2013, his head circumference was larger than normal,’ said Miss Wilson. ‘His head was long and narrow but he had a ridge at the top, which meant that newborn hats were much too small.’ However, Harry passed all his developmental checks and as far as the doctors and his parents were concerned, he was a happy, healthy baby. But, in August 2013, when he was eight-months-old, he developed gastroenteritis and required treatment at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. By chance, a paediatric nurse noticed the unusual shape and size of his head. ‘She advised us to get it measured,’ Miss Wilson said. ‘At first, I was offended but we were referred to see a specialist.’ Initially, the specialist didn’t have any concerns but then he called the family at home to say he suspected a skull defect. A scan confirmed that Harry had Saggital Craniosynostis, which affects an estimated one in every 1,800 to 3,000 children. Three out of every four cases affects boys. It can lead to a build-up in pressure in the brain causing headaches, blurred vision and breathing problems. ‘It was completely out of the blue and, at that point, our world fell apart,’ said Miss Wilson. Surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital had to cut Harry's scalp from ear to ear before breaking his skull and piecing it back together like a jigsaw puzzle . Craniosynostosis is a rare condition, which causes babies to develeop an irregularly shaped skull. The abnormal shape of a child's head can cause persistent headaches, learning difficulties, problems with vision. Symptoms of craniosynostosis result from increased pressure in the skull, called intracranial pressure. The condition causes a baby's skull to prematurely fuse, leaving it unable to grow in certain areas. Where one area is fused the skull is prevented from growing. It causes other parts of the skull to 'overgrow' to compensate and limit the pressure devleoping around the brain. The lack of growth in some areas, and 'overgrowth' in others causes the irregular head shape. Saggital synostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis, accounting for around half of all cases. It occurs when the suture - the elastic tissues connecting the plates of bone in the skull - at the top of the head fuses. It leads to a lack of growth in width and compensatory growth in length, resulting in a long, narrow skull. Source: NHS Choices . ‘The doctor explained that if nothing . was done now, Harry’s head would look like a rugby ball when he was . older and he could suffer real problems. ‘The only option was a gruelling operation. I felt sick and angry and kept thinking: ‘Why my child?’ Harry underwent the seven-and-a-half hour operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital, on March 12, when he was 13-months old. During . the painstaking procedure, surgeons cut his scalp from ear to ear, . broke his skull into pieces and, in their words, ‘put it back together . like a jigsaw puzzle’. ‘We’d been warned that there was a small risk he might not make it through the surgery,’ Miss Wilson said. ‘While . he was having the operation, Charlie and I walked around the hospital . in a daze, trying to kill time. We did a lot of crying as we waited for . news. ‘Thankfully, Harry . made it through but it was eight hours before we could see him. Nothing . could have prepared us for the sight of our baby lying in Intensive . Care, with a drain in his head. ‘The following day, his head swelled so much, he couldn’t open his eyes. He didn’t look like our little boy anymore. 'But, by day three, he was able to sit up and was in good spirits. He even unravelled the bandage from around his head. ‘We were devastated by the extent of the scarring on his scalp. The cut ran like an Alice band from ear to ear. Harry's father, Charlie Phipps (right) and his mother Amy Wilson (left) are raising money for the hospital. Miss Wilson said they are delighted at the results. 'He's bounced back amazingly from his ordeal. We're so proud of our brave boy,' she told MailOnline. ‘But the operation was a success and we were thrilled by the new shape of Harry’s head. Rather than being long and narrow, it was lovely and round. 'After five days in hospital, we were able to take our baby home.’ Ten weeks after his operation, Harry is back to his cheerful self, the swelling has gone down and his blond hair has grown over the scar, which has already started to fade. 'He's bounced back amazingly from his ordeal. We're so proud of our brave boy' - Amy Wilson, Harry's mother . Craniosynostosis can cause developmental problems, but Harry seems to be developing normally. Although there is a chance that he may develop more problems in future, regular check-ups will monitor his progress – and the family are hopeful that his health problems are in the past. ‘Although Harry’s skull feels bumpy under his scalp, where it’s still knitting back together, his head is now the perfect shape,’ Miss Wilson added. ‘He’s bounced back amazingly from his ordeal. We’re so proud of our brave boy.’ Harry’s father Charlie has just completed 20-mile sponsored assault course, the Rat Race, to raise money for Great Ormond Street hospital.

"By . Emma Innes . A fitness fanatic says he is in the best shape of his life despite eating McDonald’s for every meal for a month. Kai Sedgwick, 34, visited the fast food chain for breakfast, lunch and dinner for a month while he followed a tough workout regime. Mr Sedgwick, from Edinburgh, took up the challenge to see if he could eat burgers while getting into the best shape of his life. Kai Sedgwick, 34, carried out an experiment during which he ate only McDonald's while following a strict exercise regime for a month. He is pictured (left) before the experiment and (right) afterwards . Now, after finishing the challenge, he says he is as fit as he hoped he could become - but it’ll be a ‘long time’ before he eats a burger again. He said: ‘It was the hardest and loneliest month of my life, sitting alone eating my burgers. ‘My plan was to eat lots of McDonald’s and train really hard. It was one of the toughest things I’ve ever put myself through. ‘I was forgetting how good real food actually tastes. Anyone can eat a burger, but to eat one for nearly every meal for a month is really hard. ‘Food is meant to be a cultural experience, but after a while I realised I was eating for sustenance and not for the pleasure of the taste. ‘Now I’m finished, I don’t think I could eat another Big Mac for a very long time.’ Mr Sedgwick previously said he wasn’t a big fan of the food they serve McDonald’s and only went there about twice a year. But . over the last month he visited nine different outlets where he ate 99 . junk food meals, including 50 burgers, 45 crispy chicken wraps and . buckets of fries. Mr Sedgwick says he gained 2.7kg in muscle mass during the month-long experiment . His challenge set him back a whopping £366 - but he saved a further £55 by using vouchers. He took on 80,000 calories and expected to eat three kilos of fat as part of his daft diet, which he recorded on his blog. But his tough workout made sure that he ended up gaining 2.7kg in muscle mass during the experiment. After pumping iron, working a rowing machine and doing lots of running, he has lost a staggering 27 per cent of his body fat while he burnt 13,500 calories. Mr . Sedgwick said: ‘The first week was pretty tough when I started, but . after a while it just became routine going in to sit down and eat my . meal. ‘My . fitness is pretty good and I was quite surprised that I reached all the . fitness targets I set myself at the beginning of the month. ‘The hardest part was when I got the energy rush soon after eating from the calorie-rich food.’ He also added that he never even took his children along for a Happy Meal. Mr Sedgwick ate 99 junk food meals, including 50 burgers, 45 crispy chicken wraps and buckets of fries . He said: ‘I never told my kids what I was doing but eventually their mum told them. ‘I refused to take them with me while I was doing it, because I didn’t want them to get into any bad habits. ‘They had one with me at the end, but I wouldn’t let them come with me before that.’ But . despite making almost a hundred visits to McDonald’s, the restaurant . staff never even found out why he came to dine on a daily basis. He added: ‘The staff at my local McDonald’s didn’t learn my name. I think that’s because I never told them what I was doing. ‘I just went in with my headphones on and ordered my meal. ‘I’d imagine they’re probably a bit confused about why one of their most regular customers has stopped coming in though.' He said: ""I sent myself the task of eating every item on the McDonald's menu during the month and I managed to do that.""In the morning I'd usually have a breakfast roll, hash browns and a coffee, and for lunch I'd have one of the burgers with fries and a Sprite Zero.""For dinner I tended to either have a chicken wrap or salad with a small cheeseburger on the side to keep me going through the night."" Mr . Sedgwick will now continue his workout regime but swap the ‘McDiet’ for . fresh fruit, vegetables and low fat foods in order to draw a comparison . by the end of June. He will also be recording how much money he spends in comparison and by the end of the two months. Following the experiment, it will be long time before he eats a burganr again, he says . Nutrionist Dr Chris Fenn, who has been monitoring Mr Sedgwick's 'McWorkout' challenge,  said: 'I've seen the photographs and Kai's six-pack does look impressive. It just shows you what a lot of exercise can do. 'He's worked hard to get the six-pack, but the workout would have been more effective if he had put decent food into his body. 'You can get away with eating junk once in a while, but he has gone to the extreme of eating it on a daily basis. 'One of the things he noticed was that his mood was changing and that he was starting to feel tired, lethargic and anxious. 'It's the wrong type of food which tends to clog up your cells and affects your brain activity. 'Another thing that was affected was his bowels, because McDonald's food contains hardly any fibre which is crucial to cleaning your digestive system. 'Once his blood results are in, there might be other results of toxins lurking in his body.'McDonald's would not comment on the workout project, but a spokeswoman added: 'At McDonald's, we serve good food made from quality ingredients. 'We offer our customers a range of menu options and provide clear nutrition information to help them make informed choices that are right for them.'","Kai Sedgwick, 34, ate McDonald's for breakfast, lunch and dinner .

"By . Leon Watson . An aspiring Oxbridge student who suffers from a rare condition that stops her coping with stress fears the pressure of cramming for exams could kill her. Jennifer Lloyd's illness means instead of producing adrenalin to cope when she gets anxious, the 17-year-old's body reacts by shutting down her vital organs. She has had to begin revising . for exams months in advance - in the hope she will banish any last minute cramming stress . that could trigger her disease. Rare illness: Jennifer Lloyd, from Prestwich, Manchester, fears cramming for tests more than all of her friends - because exam stress could kill her . Jennifer suffers from Addison's disease . which leaves her in danger of suffering a medical crisis at times of stress. If . she doesn't receive rapid treatment, she vomits, passes out or could . die. The teenager, who is studying for her AS-levels, suffered a major attack that left her in hospital last summer when she was preparing for her GCSEs. And she has even been forced to turn down interviews for Oxbridge schemes because she fears the stress of studying at the world-famous institutions away from home could be deadly. Jennifer, from Prestwich, Manchester, said: 'It's very tough when it gets to exam season as I have to balance my time perfectly. 'The illness leaves me very tired, so my mum often finds me asleep in my books while I've been studying. 'I know I can't let myself get unnecessarily stressed out, so I have to be much more organised than my friends. Addison's disease suffer Jennifer Lloyd studying hard in hospital for her upcoming exams . Talented student Jennifer Lloyd was diagnosed with Addison's disease as a child after her mother Amanda, 51, noticed her craving salt on a family holiday to Malta . 'As a result I have a strict schedule where, if I do an hour of revision, I have to rest for two hours before doing any more. 'It means I can be short on time so I start preparing weeks in advance of everyone else to fit everything in. 'I . have been offered the chance to go and view Oxford and Cambridge . Universities as part of my college's Gifted and Talented students . programme, which is such an honour - but I just don't feel ready to move . away yet. The teenager with her mother Amanda: Instead of producing adrenalin to cope with stress, Jennifer's body reacts by shutting down her vital organs . Addison's affects around one in every 15,000 people and is caused by a lack of steroid hormones in the body. These are normally produced by the adrenal gland, but damage can cause levels to drop. The disease is normally caused by the body's own immune system turning on the adrenal gland, but cancer and tuberculosis can also trigger the condition. The impact on the body can be significant. One steroid, called cortisol, is involved in controlling how much water there is in the body as well as helping to fight inflammation. Another, aldosterone, regulates salt and water levels and blood pressure. Without properly-functioning adrenal glands the body cannot cope at times of stress - such as surgery, trauma or serious infection. The condition was discovered by Dr Thomas Addison in London in 1849. Jane Austen, John F Kennedy and Osama bin Laden are all thought to have been affected. Following Kennedy's assassination in 1963, pathologists found 'almost no adrenal tissue' according to an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Now patients are treated with cheap steroid tablets. 'My college has . been incredibly supportive - my teachers know the danger signs and can . call my mum straight away if they think I'm getting ill. 'After . my first week at college, I wanted to quit because the stress of . meeting so many new people was making me ill, but my mentor, Beverley . Jones, convinced me to stay, which I'm really grateful for.' Jennifer . is gearing up for AS-level exams in psychology, geography, business and . photography, at Pendleton Sixth Form College, knowing she has to . prepare well in advance in case Addison's disease strikes. If she doesn't receive rapid treatment, the student suffers an Addisonian crisis where her eyes roll to the back of her head and she starts vomiting, requiring urgent hospital treatment. Now, after a decade, Jennifer is always prepared for when a 'crisis' hits, carrying a hydro-cortisone injection at all times - and she doubles her normal medication on the run up to important exams. She added: 'I want to be a child psychologist, but it's hard to study for exams because they're really stressful. 'I did most of my revision last year hooked up to a drip in hospital - my weight dropped to 5st10lb because my stomach stopped absorbing fats. 'I was thrilled when I managed to gain 10 A grades and two A*s though - all the stress paid off!' Jennifer was first diagnosed with Addison's 10 years ago after her mother, Amanda, 51, noticed her craving salt on a family holiday to Malta. She said: 'The first time we noticed any of Jennifer's symptoms was when we were on holiday - she was eating salt straight from the shakers on restaurant tables. 'The rest of the family went a bit pink from the sun too, but Jennifer went very brown - she looked like she'd had a terrible spray tan. 'When we got home, we took her straight to the doctor's for tests, and we discovered she was craving salt because her body wasn't retaining it. 'She was diagnosed with Addison's weeks later, and in many ways it was a relief to finally know what was wrong, but the condition is hard for us all to live with.' In 2004 Amanda started a charity, called Jenny's Pennies, which has raised £17,000 for the endocrine department at Manchester Children's Hospital in appreciation of Jennifer's care.","Jennifer Lloyd suffers rare condition that shuts down her body under stress .

"By . Mark Prigg . Soldiers are set to get a Google Glass-like augmented reality system designed for the battlefield. Called ARC4, it allows commanders to send maps and other information directly to the soldier's field of vison. The gadget attaches to a military helmet, and can even be integrated with weapons control system. Scroll down for video . Called ARC4, the new system allows commanders to send maps and other information directly to the soldier's field of vison. The system can overlay key information such as the location of enemies, satellite footage and mission objectives . Rather than looking down at a 2D map or chest-worn computer, the soldier sees virtual icons (such as navigation waypoints, friendly/blue forces, and aircraft) overlaid on their real-world view. The software will run on a specially adapted display that clips onto helmets, or on a range of existing AR goggles. It can track exactly where a user is looking and adjust the display accordingly. The firm behind it, Applied Research Associates, says the system was developed as part of a six year project with substantial investment from the US Military's DARPA unit. 'We worked closely with warﬁghters throughout the design, analysis, and ﬁeld testing phases of the program,' the firm said. Rather than looking down at a 2D map or chest-worn computer, the soldier sees virtual icons (such as navigation waypoints, friendly/blue forces, and aircraft) overlaid on their real-world view. 'You are able to perform your mission with high awareness of their surroundings, with enhanced safety, speed, and in close coordination with team members,' ARA claims. 'This state-of-the-art technology provides heads-up situational awareness for the military – allowing soldiers to perform their jobs with enhanced safety, speed, and mission effectiveness,' the firm said. However, it could also be used in logistics and even by the public. How it works: The system is connected to control units on the soldier's body. Information is sent wirelessly to the soldier and displayed over one of their eyes. As well as military uses, the new system could be used for: . Consumer Products: Real-world object tagging and sharing for socially networked users . Team Coordination: Shared awareness for emergency management and response . Logistics and operations: Tracking assets, personnel, and tasks for worksites and events . Immersive Training and gaming: Virtual avatars and effects embedded with live operations . The software will run on a specially adapted display that clips onto helmets, or on a range of existing AR goggles. It can track exactly where a user is looking and adjust the display accordingly. The gadget's lead engineer, Dave Roberts, said it is 'a flat-out game changer that’s ideal for anyone who wants to visualize, create, and share heads-up information. 'ARC4 will change the way you see and interact with the world around you – the same way the smart phone changed the way you communicate.' The firm experimented with dozens of prototypes for the system before deciding on the final model (left) The ARC4 software renders AR information on any wearable see-through display – including night vision devices, making it easy to integrate with existing product. The firm also says its system is more advanced that Google's Glass. 'ARC 4 does more than present conventional communications and directional information (e.g., messages, tweets, maps, pictures) in a heads-up fashion.

He was understood to have doused himself in petrol before setting himself alight at a busy Geelong intersection. The 29-year-old feared being sent back to Sri Lanka, a spokesman for the Tamil Refugee Council told The Age. Leo Seemanpillai had been living in Australia on a bridging visa since January 2013. Scroll down for video . Scared: Leo Seemanpillai had been living in Australia on a bridging visa since January 2013. He died on Saturday night . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed that the Tamil man, who was living in Geelong, Victoria, died of his injuries on Saturday night. Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Aran Mylvaganam, who was at Mr Seemanpillai's hospital bedside on Saturday night, said he had known him for 13 months. 'He feared for his life if he was returned to Sri Lanka,' Mr Mylvaganam said. Both of Mr Seemanpillai's parents lived in a refugee camp in India, where he had also spent time. They are reported to be in shock over their son's death. Trevor Grant, a convenor at the Tamil Refugee Council, revealed that Mr Seemanpillai suffered depression after fleeing Sri Lanka about five years ago. 'He knew that if he was sent back he'd face persecution from the military,' Mr Grant explained. He also said the asylum seeker was on the organ donor register and five people have received his organs after his death on Saturday. Immigration Minister, Scott Morrison revealed that the asylum seeker died after receiving burns to 90 per cent of his body . A Victoria Police spokeswoman says officers were called to a unit fire in inner suburban Newtown on Saturday morning following reports a man was on fire in the front yard. It's believed the injuries were self-inflicted, she said. 'I'm advised by my department that a man believed to be an illegal maritime arrival of Sri Lankan nationality suffered serious burns in an incident in Geelong yesterday morning, I understand he died of his injuries overnight,' Mr Morrison told the ABC. Emergency services rushed the man to Geelong Hospital after hearing reports a man who was on fire near the intersection of Cairns St and West Fyans St after 10.30am. Mr Seemanpillai was then flown to The Alfred hospital in a critical condition where he died. Mr Morrison said the man arrived at Darwin in January 2013 before being granted a bridging visa in May, and again in July. The 29-year-old was on fire near the intersection of Cairns St and West Fyans St in Geelong . Ambulance Victoria spokesman John Mullen said bystanders tried to help the man when he ran from the unit. 'He was seen running out into the street on fire. Bystanders have tried to douse the flames with water,' Mr Mullen told AAP on Sunday. He said Mr Seemanpillai suffered full thickness burns to most of his body. The minister extended the government's sympathies to the man's friends and overseas-based family. 'The department and its Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme provider are working with the hospital and community, with members of the family also to make funeral arrangements...

"By . Deni Kirkova . Many people will know the familiar nag of 'when are you going to find yourself a nice partner and settle down?' but most would simply shrug it off. One woman however grew so tired of being pestered about settling down that 14 years ago she decided to fabricate her own family. Suzanne Heintz has been photographing her imaginary life with mannequin husband and mannequin child - from proposal, to wedding, to family holidays - ever since. The American photographer, 42, presents her work in a funny, thought-provoking and undoubtedly challenging picture series called The Playing House Project: Life Once Removed. Scroll down for video . American conceptual photographer Suzanne Heintz feigns surprise at a proposal to 'renew vows' Suzanne was tired of the pressure to conform to expectations for a 'woman her age to have a ring on her finger'. She was sick of people's unrealistic expectations from herself and from life in general - but in particular that of women and marriage. 'People said: ""You're such a nice girl, why aren't you married?"" she writes. 'No one actually used that out of date word, but, what they were driving at was that I was a ""Spinster"", and I got tired of hearing about it. Even my Mother must have thought she was setting me straight when she said: ""Suzy, there's nobody perfect out there. You just need to PICK somebody, if you're going to settle down"" 'I snapped back, 'Mom! It's not like I can go out and BUY a family! I can't just MAKE it happen!"" But then, I found a way. I bought a beautiful family… of mannequins. I decided to start a photo project out of the Kodak Moments I'd capture with my new Store-Bought Family.' Suzanne gets up after sleeping in on a lazy Sunday morning, beside her imitation husband as part of her 14 year self-portrait photo series . Suzanne enjoys a French breakfast at Cafe Constant with her imitation husband while on holiday (l) and in front of the Eiffel Tower, with her imitation family . Suzanne . was raised in the Mormon Church in New York, which made a lasting . impression. It provided her first experience in the idealisation of . family, and the glorification of the role of women as mother and . homemaker. These . influences have come together in shaping the focus of her subject . matter. The external pressures of culture, and the internal pressures . she placed on herself to fit into the expectations of that culture, . built up over time, until she decided to do something about it. The artist employs satire and . importantly humour in her work, because she feels that it is crucial to . the digestion of what might be perceived as a 'bitter pill of social . criticism'. 'My own home was the backdrop for the first images,' she explains. 'Over . the next decade, scenes of an idyllic home life eventually extended . into a series of holiday greetings, as a satirical response to annual . family photo cards. However, the project took a turn after taking them . on a road trip. I saw the potential in shooting in public. 'Seeing . me work with the mannequins is such a peculiar and funny thing to . witness, that people are immediately disarmed. As soon as that happens, . their mind is open and impressionable. 'Using . humor, paired with shock, allows my message to penetrate, and the work . can have greater impact. The aim is to get people to reconsider their . stubborn allegiance to traditional life expectations.' Suzanne poses with her imitation husband for a mock wedding portrait outside of a local Chapel . 'The term perfect is no longer used to describe what we're all striving to be. Now it is called fulfilled,' she says. 'But . for women, the path to fulfillment is not through one thing, it's . through all things; education, career, home, family, accomplishment, . enlightenment.

It's about anyone whose life doesn't look . the way it ""should"". 'Rarely . does anyone's life turn out the way it was expected, and if by some . miracle it does, what they expected isn't what they thought it was.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . An astronaut spending time alone on the ISS gazes out into the cosmos when, suddenly, they feel themselves being hugged. No, this isn’t the plot for a space romance movie, rather, it’s a scenario envisaged by Unlimited Theatre in West Yorkshire. As part of a Nasa contest they’ve designed a spacesuit that can not only simulate the feeling of being hugged, but also give an astronaut live information about their home town. A team from West Yorkshire has won one of the categories in Nasa's International Space Apps Challenge by designing a prototype spacesuit for future astronauts (pictured with founder Jon Spooner inside). The design includes inflatable shoulders that can be used to give the astronaut a 'wearable hug' The contest is an annual Nasa-run event called the International Space Apps Challenge. Taking place over two days in cities around the world, the contest sees teams attempt to solve problems related to both life on Earth and space with open-source solutions. Tim Peake, currently training with Esa, will be the first British astronaut to visit the ISS when he launches in November 2015. The first Briton in space was Helen Sharman in November 1989, who also became the first woman to visit the Soviet Union’s Mir space station. No other solely British people have been to space, although there have been some with dual citizenship. Of these four were British-American: Michael Foale (nine missions), Piers Sellers (three missions), Nicholas Patrick (two missions) and Richard Garriott (one paid mission). And one other, Michael Shuttleworth, is a South African-Brit who also paid to go to space. These take place within five themes: Earth Watch, Technology in Space, Human Spaceflight, Robotics and Asteroids. The team from the Unlimited Theatre, calling themselves the Unlimited Space Agency, were taking part in a project to create wearable technologies for future astronauts at the Met Office’s site in Exeter. To do so they consulted with British astronaut Tim Peake, who is set to travel to the ISS on a 6-month mission in November 2015. Their final design, the team says, was to create a suit that was both uniquely useful for astronauts on the ISS but also with applications on Earth. The most interesting innovation was the ‘wearable hug’ feature. A family member on Earth could activate inflatable material in the shoulders of the suit to give the astronaut a simulated hug and let them know they’re being thought of. Video courtesy of Unlimited Theatre . The spacesuit designed by Unlimited Theatre has a number of innovations designed for future astronauts. These include inflatable shoulders that can simulate a 'hug' and a set of LEDs on the wrist that tell the astronaut what the weather is like back home. In the right image you can see the pack used to power it . The project was undertaken by a group of students of all ages at the Met Office's site in Exeter under the auspices of the Unlimited Theatre Company (with the temporary name of the Unlimited Space Agency), while British astronaut in training Tim Peake provided additional support via video chat (pictured) Meanwhile, on the sleeve of the suit is a vision board that displays live weather status for the wearer’s home location. And in the pocket they envisage a future 3D printer that can instantly deliver tools, parts and gifts directly to the astronaut. Another innovative feature would be a mission patch that people on Earth can wear. This would light up with embedded LEDs when the ISS passes overhead. The team says this same technology could be used for other purposes, such as providing updates as to when a football team scores a goal. Their project was named the overall global winner of the Best Mission Concept category. And the company hopes some of their ideas will go into a spacesuit to be worn by Tim Peake when he undertakes his mission to the ISS. The contest is an annual Nasa-run event called the International Space Apps Challenge. Taking place over two days in cities around the world, the contest sees teams attempt to solve problems related to both life on Earth and space with open-source solutions . 'A scientist would not have come up with the idea of a wearable hug, that was one of the fashion student’s ideas,’ Jon Spooner, one of the founders of the Unlimited Theatre Company, told the Yorkshire Evening Post. ‘A lot of people assume that only scientists can do useful stuff and that is not right. It’s about working in collaboration with people. ‘No one person can achieve anything on their own. It’s all about exploration and ideas. ‘We’re delighted to have won. While we’re proud leaders of the project, it was a truly collaborative effort and is further evidence of the power of art, play and storytelling to inspire engagement with science. 'The support we received in particular from the Met Office and the Faculty of Arts and Design at Exeter College was inspirational.' Tim Peake, meanwhile, added: ‘The Unlimited Space Agency is great. Their approach to inspiring children about science is rigorous, fun and it works. 'I’m proud to serve with them on their mission to inspire the next generation of scientists and space explorers.’","Unlimited Theatre Company wins Nasa contest to design a new spacesuit .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Google may have mapped some of the most remote regions on Earth, but outer space remains a vast and dark mystery. Now one Canadian app, named SkyWatch, is hoping to give space the ‘Google Maps’ treatment by plotting cosmic events in real-time for amateur astronomers. Using raw data from Nasa, the app displays events such as supernovas and comets,on a Google Maps interface and highlights them as they happen. Scroll down for video . SkyWatch is hoping to give space the ‘Google Maps’ treatment by plotting cosmic events in real-time for amateur astronomers. The Toronto-based team came up with the app during Nasa’s International Space Apps Challenge and is currently working on a prototype. An early version of the design is pictured here . The Toronto-based team came up with the app during Nasa’s International Space Apps Challenge and is currently working on a prototype. ‘When we were first conceptualising SkyWatch, we aimed to build a tool that simply “opened up the heavens” to the seven billion-plus here on Earth,’ said developer James Slilfierz. ‘As the product developed we began to realise an even greater potential: one that allowed children to witness spectacular events millions of light years away at the exact same time as Nasa scientists, a privilege never before recognised.’ The Skywatch app is powered with data from Nasa’s Gamma-ray Coordinates Network. The data from this network reveals the coordinates of celestial events as they happen in space. After learning the physical location of the cosmic event, a Google Maps interface is combined with Google Sky Map to come up with a real-time visual map of space. An algorithm is used to to pick out interesting features, such as supernovas, which are visually mapped on the app. A Toronto-based team came up with the app during Nasa’s International Space Apps Challenge and is currently working on a prototype. The app is powered with data from Nasa’s Gamma-ray Coordinates Network. Scientists input data they want to share with other scientists and the servers send out the data to other telescopes in various locations. SkyWatch aims to use that data in a ‘Twitter-like platform where people all over the world can follow what is happening in the skies at all times.’ Without an astrophysicist on board, the team spent a large proportion of their time trying to find out what the telemetric data collected from Nasa meant, according to a report in Motherboard. After find out the physical location of the event, the Google Maps portion of the app is paired up with another Google product: Google Sky Map. The team combine Sky Map’s interface with telemetric data from Earth to come up with a real time visual map of space.

Dexter Jagula, the team project leader told Motherboard users experience the ‘celestial event in space... as close to real time as we can.’ The team have now created an algorithm is able to automatically track events that people are interested in. Mr Jagula believes visually replicating space events in real-time is vital to promoting space research to a younger generation. The team hopes to have a working app available ‘sooner rather than later’ for mobile platforms.","The app combines raw data from Nasa with a Google Maps interface .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Spacewalks are one of the most impressive and dangerous feats an astronaut can perform on the ISS. Fixing critical components often involves lengthy stints outside the spacecraft, with a spacesuit acting as the only barrier between an astronaut and lethal radiation. But this could soon be a thing of the past. The space station's Canadian robotic arm, dubbed Canadarm2, is currently attempting to fix itself without any help from a human. Scroll down for video . Dextre, which was sent to the space station in 2008, has arms more than 9.8 feet (3 metres) in length and has  power tools as fingers. Together, Dextre and Canadarm2 make up the space station's robotic Mobile Servicing System, making this the first ever robot self-repair service in space . Canadarm2’s multi-limbed robotic helper, called Dextre, is in the process of a week-long repair job to move and fix old cameras. Dextre has arms that are more than 9.8 feet (3 metres) in length which can attach to power tools that act like its fingers. Together, Dextre and Canadarm2 make up the space station's robotic Mobile Servicing System, making this the first ever robot self-repair service in space. The robots are controlled remotely from the Canadian Space Agency headquarters in Longueuil, Quebec, and Nasa’s Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas. Dextre is moving a camera on Canadarm2 to the mobile base to replace a completely broken camera. It will then install a new, spare camera on the Canadarm2. The cameras are part of an 11-strong set on the Mobile Servicing System that perform surveys outside the space station. Dextre's role is to keep the International Space Station (ISS) in working order. Having Dextre on call will reduce the amount of risky spacewalks, giving astronauts more time for science, . Dextre’s special skills and unique location outside the ISS offers an opportunity for space agencies to test ground for new robotics concepts like servicing satellites in space. The robot can ride on the end of Canadarm2 to move from worksite to worksite, or hitch a ride on the Mobile Base System. The space handyman is currently in the process of a week-long repair job to move and fix old cameras on Canadarm2. The astronauts' only involvement in the operation was to push the spare camera into an airlock so Dextre could grab it. While this is the first time a robotic repair task like this has been performed, Mathieu Caron, mission control supervisor at the Canadian Space Agency, told CBCNews.Ca it won’t be the last. ‘Using the Canadarm2 and Dextre reduces the overall number of spacewalks, definitely,’ he said. ‘Spacewalks are very complex and use a lot of space station resources. ‘They monopolise astronauts not only for the duration of the spacewalk, but in the weeks leading up to it for all their preparation.’ However, Dextre has some of its own drawbacks that it still needs to overcome. For instance, it can currently only deal with ‘robotically compatible’ bolts and screws. CSO is now working to make the system more flexible. It added that Dextre is due to replace a circuit breaker in June and to repair equipment outside the space station to prepare for some astronaut spacewalks later in the summer. Having Dextre on call will reduce the amount of risky spacewalks, giving astronauts more time for science.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The harpy eagle may be the largest and most powerful raptor found in the Americas, but it is also one of the rarest. Few people have seen a harpy eagle chick, but three lucky photographers managed to snap a mother with her fluffy offspring. The wildlife experts climbed into the rainforest canopy to observe two harpy eagles with their chick for two days and got so close that they were able to get the whole birds in frame. Scroll down for video . Snap happy: Few people have seen a harpy eagle chick, but three lucky photographers managed to snap a mother with her fluffy offspring (pictured) The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) is the largest and most powerful raptor found in the Americas. They have wingspans of up to 7ft (2.1metres) and are around the same height as a five-year-old child. The birds live in the rainforest canopy, which means they are hard to spot. They have talons comparable to a grizzly bear's and a sharp beak which they use to dismember monkeys and sloths. Harpy eagles have large territories for hunting from 3,000 to 7,000 hectares. An Amazonian tribe called the Huaorani believe they are the descendants of the jaguar and harpy eagle and worship the two animals as gods. Photographer Jeff Cremer of Rainforest Expeditions said: ‘It’s so rare it’s like seeing a unicorn.’ ‘When Lucas Bustamante and Jaime Culebras [fellow photographers at TropicalHerping] sent me a message on Facebook saying that they found a harpy eagle nest I booked the next flight to the jungle.’ Harpy eagles are apex predators in the Amazon Rainforest and have huge wingspans of up to 7ft (2.1metres). When they are perched on a branch, they are around the same height as a five-year-old child. The birds might look cute, but they have talons the size of grizzly bear claws and a sharp beak which they use to dismember monkeys and sloths. Hungry: The chick has a shock of white feathers (pictured left) and was treated to two meals by its doting parents (right), while the photographers looked on from their precarious treetop perch . Harpy eagles are top avian predators in the Amazon Rainforest and have huge wingspans of up to seven ft (2.1m). When they are perched in a branch, they are around the same height as a five-year-old child, but this chick has not yet reached its full size . Despite their large size, seeing a harpy eagle is unusual as unlike other birds of prey they don’t soar, but instead prefer to lurk in the canopy of the forest, a little like a predatory cat. They are also hard to spot because they have large territories covering anywhere from 3,000 to 7,000 hectares of forest. ‘Birders spend their whole lives just to catch a glimpse of the harpy eagle,’ Mr Cremer said. ‘We were incredibly lucky to be able to sit in a tree for two days right next to a family of them. What makes that especially rare is the fact that a pair of harpy eagles nest just once every two or even three years.’ Comfy: The photographers immediately saw a harpy eagle chick nestled in a fortress of soft leaves and twigs (pictured), measuring around 4ft thick and 5ft wide, waiting for its mother to return . Dinner: The birds might look cute, but they have talons the size of grizzly bear claws and a shark beak which they use to dismember monkeys and sloths (stock image) Evidence: Like many birds of prey, harpy eagles regurgitate pellets of indigestible food. This pellet (stock image) discovered in the Amazon Rainforest in Peru, is from a seven-month-old chick and contains the claws and fur from a two-toed sloth . ‘I've seen jaguars, tapirs and pumas and have even been the first person to film new species, but seeing the harpy eagle feed and interact with its chick was really amazing.’ To get the amazing shots, the team set out in the dark at 4.30am and began to climb a tree in the rainforest, eventually setting up their kit at around 12 storeys high, on a precarious-looking platform to which they were tied. They immediately saw the harpy eagle chick nestled in a fortress of soft leaves, measuring around 4ft thick and 5ft wide (1.2metres to 1.5metres), waiting for its mother to return. ‘We were really surprised when she showed up. She swooped in without a sound while carrying a fully grown Brazilian porcupine in her claws,’ Mr Cremer said. ‘She just sat there and watched while the baby ate it up.’ Demanding: The mother harpy eagle brought her chick a fully grown Brazilian Porcupine in her claws to eat and later, her partner delivered half a sloth for the fluffy baby with a big appetite . Perched: The wildlife experts (pictured) climbed into the rainforest canopy to observe two harpy eagles with their chick for two days and got so close that they were able to get the whole birds in frame . Divine: In Ecuador there is an Amazonian tribe called the Huaorani who believe that they are descendants of the jaguar and the harpy eagle (pictured) Afterwards, the mother called her mate – a huge male – to deliver half a sloth to the nest for the second course of their dinner. Fellow wildlife photographers and biologists Mr Bustamante and Mr Culebras have spent the last decade photographing wildlife in the Ecuadorian rainforest and helped film the harpy eagle family. ‘In my country, Ecuador, there is an Amazonian tribe called the Huaorani,’ Mr Bustamante explained. ‘They believe that they are descendants of the jaguar and the harpy eagle. They worship these two animals as their gods and view them as being very important to the jungle. ‘After being face to face with a harpy eagle it is easy to see why they believe that. Finding myself in the jungle with that mythological creature, was like being in front of a legendary Griffin.’ Mr Culebras said that they were able to photograph two jaguars, a puma and her cub, a family of otters and hundreds of macaws on their trip. They also saw four species of monkeys and dozens of peccaries visiting the lodge they were staying in every day.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It’s known for its surfing and long, pristine beaches but tourists have been flocking to Matakana Island in New Zealand for a different reason lately: its artwork. Sunbathers and surfers have been doing a double-take thanks to a series of impressive 3D drawings that have been appearing in the sand. The temporary scenes are the creation of Jamie Harkins, Constanza Nightingale and David Rendu who make up 3DSD. Optical illusion: A skater appears to jump over a terrifying hole in the ground that is in fact a drawing in the sand . In a spin: Skaters show off their skills on a second ramp on the beach . The trio draw the complex designs using just a stick and a selection of rakes. Nightingale, from Chile, specialises in circular paintings covering themes such as ‘space, the ocean, and the relationships humans have with nature’. Rendu, from France, is an accomplished sculptor and explores the human form and ocean life. Beachy head: Three faces appear to emerge from the sand. The artists use a stick and a selection of rakes to create the optical illusions . Shore thing: 3DSD say their work is 'ephemeral art where time, the communicative act, and directive intent are fundamental' Meanwhile, Harkins creates colourful paintings, making use of contrast and light. The New Zealander was inspired by 3D street art and decided to take the concept to the beach on the country’s North Island. Harkins says the practice requires few materials and has the added bonus of having very large natural ‘canvases’ close at hand. The artists regularly venture down to the same beach between Mt Maunganui and Matakana Island to experiment in the sand. Macabre moment: Tourists watch the trio draw a skull in the sand.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Some of Britain's great dishes are under threat of extinction because children have never heard of them, let alone eaten them, according to a new survey. Regional favourites like Cornish pasties, Cumberland sausages and black pudding are unknown to many youngsters in the UK - with newer staples like curry and stir fries proving more popular. And some of the seafood 'delicacies' loved by our grandparents are completely misunderstood. Sheep's innards? Eurrgh: Nine in ten British children have never heard of that most Scottish dish, the haggis . Researchers have found more than half of British children (58 per cent) have never eaten a Cornish pasty, while three out of four kids have never tried a Devonshire cream tea.

The study revealed that, despite a fifth of children claiming that they like to try new foods while on holiday on British shores, the majority have never tried, or even heard, of some of the nation's classic regional dishes. One third of young Brits (32 per cent) don't know what the main ingredients of a Cornish pasty are, while seven out of 10 have never tried a Cumberland sausage. Not only has three-quarters of kids never enjoyed a Devonshire cream tea, nearly half (43 per cent) don't even know what a cream tea is. In fact nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of children think a cream tea is a cup of tea topped off with whipped cream.

The new wave: Dishes such as chicken tikka masala are more likely to feature on children's food wish lists . 'Many modern Britons appear reluctant to try the great range of regional dishes this country has to offer yet they are very open to international cuisine. 'In my experience, once people have tried these regional dishes they are pleasantly surprised at how tasty they are. 'Many regional dishes give us insights into the cooking of much earlier times and it would be a great shame to lose this culinary heritage. 'I would strongly encourage parents and their children to seek out and try these dishes for themselves in order to help preserve our food heritage for future generations. If not, we could lose both a great source of enjoyment and a very valuable part of our culinary history.' Travelodge spokeswoman Shakila Ahmed said: ""Food is a big part of Britain's rich heritage. 'However, our research has highlighted that we are at risk of losing some of our famous regional dishes because children have not been given the opportunity or encouraged to try them. 'To save Britain's food legacy, we would urge families to get up and go this summer, and taste their way through Great Britain.'","Less than a third of British kids can identify contents of a Cornish pasty .

They are the little darlings who look awfully cute in a photo, or when curled up asleep in a cot – but a lot less appealing at 30,000ft, crying loudly in the seat right next to you. And according to a new survey, almost . seven in ten Britons dislike flying with babies so much that they would . like to see child-free areas introduced on planes. Oh lord, please not next to me: Almost seven in ten Britons would like to see child-free zones on aircraft . Almost one in four British travellers – 39 per cent – believes that no-kid-zones should be installed as compulsory compartments on long-haul flights where people want to sleep. And nearly a third – 30 per cent – would go further and bring in such silent spaces on all flights, long- and short-haul, to ensure stress-free travels for non-parenting passengers. The survey was conducted by bookings website LateDeals.co.uk, with 1,108 UK consumers questioned as to what they hate most about air travel. And our dislike of noisy children and babies on planes runs deep, it seems. More than a third of us – 35 per cent – would pay extra to travel on a childless service. Long-haul passengers would be prepared to cough up an additional £63 to the cost of a return ticket if it meant adults only on board. And on short-haul flights, an extra £28 on the price of a return fare would be deemed good value if it guaranteed an absence of toddlers having tantrums in the middle of the economy-class aisle. Imperfect passengers: Babies on planes are the pet peeve of 43 per cent of British travellers - although passengers who invade your personal space on board are barely more popular, criticised by 31 per cent of us . However, screaming infants are not the only source of frustration for British travellers. In fact, according to the research, a . bawling baby ranks as only the fourth most irritating category of . nightmare airline passenger. 1. Drunk and rowdy travellers: 58%2. People with bad hygiene: 48%3. Seat-kicking passengers: 47%4. Crying babies: 43%5. Lack of legroom: 41%6. Overweight passengers/passengers who invade personal space: 31%7.

Running out of meal options: 7%14. Cabin temperature: 5% . Survey conducted by LateDeals.co.uk. 1,108 British consumers were questioned, and asked to pick three options from the list as pet peeves . Asked ‘Which of the following are the most annoying on a long flight?’, well over half of respondents – 58 per cent – selected ‘drunk and rowdy travellers’ as their pet peeve. People with ‘bad personal hygiene’ and travellers who kick the back of the seat in front were also near the top of the list, causing anger to 48 and 47 per cent of us respectively. Overweight flyers who invade other people’s space were the fifth most disliked passenger, flagged as a cause of exasperation by 31 per cent of respondees. Crying babies came in at fourth on the list, a bête noire for 43 per cent of those surveyed. ‘If you run into a screaming baby – or a noisy, hyperactive toddler and its exasperated parents – on a train, you can just move carriages,’ says Kay Dixon of LateDeals.co.uk. ‘The same does not apply to a flight. ‘If you are sitting next to a family with kids that can’t settle down, there is nowhere to go. ‘While most people are sympathetic towards parents with young children, many people simply don’t want so sit next to them – which is why the majority would like to see child-free zones on planes, and more than a third even want child-free planes.’ Other causes of aggravation revealed in the survey included people who hog the armrest between seats (nominated by 14 per cent of those questioned), people who snore (10 per cent) and rude cabin crew (nine per cent).","The majority of British travellers wish to see child-free areas on aircraft .

"By . Leesa Smith . Australians are putting themselves at risk of their personal information being hacked with a survey revealing fewer than a third of smartphone and tablet users install security software. The survey, released today by the Government's Federal Communications Department, also showed 40 per cent of the 1,000 respondents couldn’t identify any signs of online safety breaches. Released as part of Stay Smart Online Week, the national survey found 63 per cent of public WiFi users never run virus checks while less than one in five 'always' do. Australians need to be more savvy about security when it comes to using wifi in public places . University of Adelaide information security expert Dr Malcolm Pattinson labelled WiFi as the ‘most insecure mechanism’ for sharing information and a ‘goldmine’ for criminals. He advised people not to use public WiFi at all and particularly not for online banking, while the Federal Government advises no financial transactions should be done with public WiFi. ‘It’s so easy to tap into and they can track keystrokes,’ he told The Advertiser. ‘They get your credit card number and your password.’ ‘We have to prepare people for when it happens, not if it happens.’ According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1.2 million Australians aged 15 and over were victims of at least one incident of identity fraud in 2011, up from 806,000 victims in 2007. While only 10 per cent of victims knew their details were stolen via email or the internet, the real figure was likely to be much higher because close to half had no idea how their personal information was taken. The Australian Institute of Crime reports that one in 20 household users have been victimised by scams or identity fraud with the reasons identified as a lack of knowledge, prevention and behaviour change. Michael McKinnon from AVG internet security said Facebook and Twitter had increased their use of encryptions to stop hacking of accounts through public WiFi. 'The problem is there are tens of thousands of websites not using those protections and theoretically anyone could access anything you are sharing with those websites,' he said. 'There is a real trade-off between the convenience of public wi-fi and the security aspect of it.' Mr McKinnon said it was reasonably safe to do online banking in public using full web addresses starting with “http” that users should bookmark, while typing in bank addresses starting with 'www' left users vulnerable to attack. He said Australian banks had a good record of refunding money lost to cyber attacks.","Survey of 1,000 Australians reveals fewer than a third of mobile and tablet users install security software .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Just decades ago it was a derelict wreck - a relic of an agricultural past long in decline. But this windmill in Kirkham, Lancashire has been converted into a stunning luxury home worth as much as £650,000. The property - appropriately called Wynde Milne - was built in 1812 but by the end of the century it was dormant and decaying. Views: The home boasts two balconies, as well as two bathrooms and a large garden . Conversion: The three-storey windmill used to be derelict, but is now a luxury five-bedroom home . Inside: The home has been painstakingly converted, and makes innovative use of the mill's unique architecture . Derelict: Wynde Milne in Kirkham, Lancashire, stood ruined until a local builder converted it in 1973 . Ruined: It is thought the windmill fell into disrepair around the end of the 19th century . In 1973 a local builder bought up the three-floor location and turned it into a serviceable house. But it was years later that current owners Brian and Sandra Peet, both 66, unlocked its true potential. The home boasts five double bedrooms, two en-suite bathrooms, two reception rooms, a modern breakfast kitchen, utility room, two balconies and a large garden. Mr Peet, who has four children and 10 grandchildren, said: 'We bought it because we knew it would make the perfect family home. 'We’re not crazy about windmills or anything like that but we just thought it was a beautiful house. We are both from this area and Sandra used to play in it when she was a little girl and it was derelict. 'The whole town is built around it and we’d always said it would make a great place to live. I’ve loved living here. The views are beautiful and you can see right up to the Lake District.' Grand: The owners said that the entire village is built around the windmill . Approach: The handsome property has taken years to perfect, and is now on the market for £650,000 . Grounds: The windmill also has a large garden . After 17 years of owning the windmill Mr and Mrs Peet have decided to sell up - and look set to reap their rewards as it has been placed on the market for £650,000. Mr Peet said: 'The place still has lots of character. Inside there’s lots of exposed brick, which dates back to when it was built. 'In the garden there are two original mill stones and there is an old original wooden beam in the lounge. 'I really think it’s one of the nicest properties in this part of the world and to actually live in a windmill and be part of that heritage is fantastic. 'My kids and grandkids have all loved playing in it and I think we’ll really miss it when we go. 'Having said that, it’s time to move on and I really hope whoever buys it will take good care of it and enjoy living here'. Heyday: This painting, dated 1989, shows Wynde Milne before it fell into disrepair . Richard Schofield, who works for Country Lane estate agents, which is marketing the windmill at £650,000, said it requires minimal maintenance and only needs painting once every 10 years. Richard said: 'As soon as you walk in the front entrance, which is not a normal entrance, you are confronted by a huge spiral stair case up to the first floor, which is the living area.

The bird miraculously survived the encounter while the Japanese-made car was left with a large hole in the bumper. The accident happened near an industrial park in Xinfeng county in south China’s Jiangxi province. Huang Lingyong, 31, was at the wheel of his Toyota Corolla doing around 70 mph when the bird suddenly crossed the road in front of him. Bird-brained: The driver was doing around 70mph near an industrial park in Xinfeng county, south China, when the bird walked out in front of him . 'I braked because I am an animal lover and didn’t want to harm the chicken,' said Huang. 'But it was too late. 'I heard a sickening thud and I thought the chicken had gone to meet his ancestors. 'I stopped the car, got out and walked around to the front. There was a hole in the bodywork and the chicken wedged inside. I thought it must be dead but then I heard a cluck-clucking and bent down to look closer. It was a little shaken up and its feathers all ruffled, but otherwise OK. Stuck: The man behind the wheel said he heard a 'sickening thud' before stepping out to see the brid wedged in the front of the car . 'It seemed to me to be a very good advert for the durability of chickens and a very bad one for the quality of the car that I was driving. 'I took some video with my phone and uploaded the pictures on to the web and I was not surprised when there was a lot of feedback from people who shared my opinion of the car.'

"EXCLUSIVE By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . UK taxpayers are spending £30million-a-year sending child benefit to families who live abroad across the European Union. David Cameron has admitted it is ‘impossible’ to stop the cash being exported each year by migrant workers whose families are spread across the continent. But in the wake of the UKIP triumph in the European and local elections, he faces growing pressure from Tory MPs to act now, with calls for a bar on claiming welfare for up to five years after arriving in Britain. Almost two-thirds of all child benefit exported from the UK is sent to Poland, according to latest figures released to Parliament . New figures show that last year the British taxpayer paid child benefit to 20,400 families, covering 34,268 children. Child benefit is paid at £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for every other child, regardless of parental income. It means the total bill for children living overseas is up to £30million-a-year. There has been a slight fall since 2012, when an extra 3,682 families claimed child benefit abroad. Each year more than £30million in child benefit is sent to families across the EU, paid for by the British taxpayer . Prime Minister David Cameron has warned it is all but impossible to tackle the problem of child benefit being sent abroad under current EU law . Almost two-thirds of the families are in Poland, claiming for 22,093 children. People in the UK are also sending child benefit to 1,231 families in Ireland for 2,505 children. A further 1,215 in Lithuania, 797 in Latvia, 789 in France, 692 in Slovakia and 600 in Spain are all receiving child benefit from the UK Treasury. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has capitalised on warnings that the UK cannot control its own borders or welfare system while it remains a member of the European Union. Mr Farage said the Government's three-month ban on migrants claiming benefits in Britain was not long enough. He said there should be a five year block on allowing immigrants to get any benefits. He said: ""We must be completely mad to be giving people from Eastern Europe in-work benefits.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who celebrated winning the European elections this week, has warned Britain cannot control its borders or welfare system while it remains a member of the EU . Mr Cameron has vowed to tackle the problem as part of his plan to claw back powers from Brussels before staging an in-out EU referendum before 2017. But he admits that until his negotiations begin, after the 2015 election, it is virtually impossible to stop the money being sent abroad. Speaking earlier this month, the Prime Minister told the BBC: ‘Today if you travel and work from another European country into Britain, you can then claim child benefit and other benefits for your family back at home even though actually they’re not living in the UK and going to UK schools and all the rest of it. ‘And under the current rules, it seems extremely difficult, if not impossible, to change that. Now I haven’t met anybody who thinks this is sensible … so that is again a really big change.’ The government insists that the ‘main purpose of child benefit is to support families in the UK’. However, EU rules mean that social security must be paid across borders. But ministers are drawing up plans for a new crackdown on migrants’ access to benefits to try to win back disaffected voters from Ukip. The new push, which could see unemployed EU nationals kicked out of the country after just six months, was announced yesterday amid continued fallout from the Ukip surge in last week’s elections. Currently, new arrivals cannot claim benefits for the first three months in the country followed by six months in which they can. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said he welcome the fact that the number of children abroad to which the UK provides benefits has decreased. He added: ''The number of children receiving benefit still remains high and despite widespread frustration without EU reform this issue will never be resolved. 'The Prime Minister should lay out his reform agenda now or face an impossible task.' Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee . Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, who obtained the figures through a parliamentary questions, said: ‘I have a very simple view of this. I think that a common market does not mean we have a common benefits system. ‘I don’t believe that anybody coming in from the Europe Union should get any benefits at all until they are more permanently settled in this country. I think it should be five years before they get benefits – three months is not good enough. ‘I know David Cameron says we cannot do it at the moment. I think we should. ‘If they need benefits they should return to their own country and claim benefits there.’ On January 1 new rules were introduced to stop new arrivals claiming benefits for up to three months, to deter people from coming from Romania and Bulgaria when work restrictions were lifted. Last week figures showed that the number of people getting work from the two countries fell from 144,000 in the last three months of 2013 to the first three months of 2014. Treasury minister Nicky Morgan said: ‘The recent changes to migrants’ access to benefits announced by the Government sends a strong message that the UK benefit system is not open to abuse, as well as deterring those who may seek residence in the UK primarily to claim benefits. ‘Strengthening compliance checks will help prevent EEA migrants from claiming, and continuing to claim,benefits they are not entitled to. Checks will be applied to both new claims and existing awards.’","UK taxpayer funds payments to 20,400 families with 34,268 children .

"By . Richard Arrowsmith . Roma have slapped a £50million price tag on in-demand defender Medhi Benatia. The Morocco international has attracted interest from the likes of Barcelona and Chelsea - while Manchester City had a £16.5million offer rejected on Friday. The Premier League champions are also interested in Porto's French defender Eliaquim Mangala, although he is believed to prefer a move to Chelsea. Benatia has been fined by Roma for publicly criticising their latest contract offer, accusing the club of treating him 'like a child' after being offered what he considered an 'unacceptable' pay rise. Priced out of the market? Roma have put a £50m price tag on Manchester City target Medhi Benatia . However, club director Walter Sabatini insists the 27-year-old will not be allowed to leave for less than 61million Euros (£50million). Speaking on Roma's official website, Sabatini said: 'Mehdi is a great player with a contract that expires in four years' time. We have no problem with him. Case for the defence: City have shown interest in Medhi Benatia (L) and Eliaquim Mangala (R) 'Perhaps he slipped up with a few comments or words but he didn't intend to distance himself from Roma or the fans. He mentioned broken promises. That's not exactly how it went. It's true that when he signed for Roma he turned down other offers that were higher than ours. 'I said to him: 'You try and play like Benatia and we'll give you an improved contract.' We offered him an increase -- although there was no obligation for us to do so -- and we didn't agree on the amount, but he didn't mean to describe it as 'ridiculous.' He's speaking a language that's not his own -- you can't slaughter him for it.' Blues in the red: City won the Premier League but will have their spending restricted by FFP regulations . Sabatini stressed that Benatia would stay at Roma and accused the player's agent, Moussa Sissoko, of creating problems. 'I'd like to remind this man that 30 million is the price I believe Benatia's weak foot to be worth, his left. His right foot is worth at least a million more. So you do the maths.' 'As I've said, the player is not for sale, but if his agent wants to speculate on a price for him, then any clubs who are interested should consider him to be worth 61 million. 'If someone were to offer that amount, then I don't think I could guarantee that he would stay 100 percent.'","Medhi Benatia will not be allowed to leave Roma for less than £50m .

Hodgson had split his outfield players into positional groups for this part of the morning session and the England boss would have been delighted to see the glint in Rooney's eye. The United star missed the end of the . season with a groin problem and took fitness and conditioning experts . with him on holiday at the end of the campaign, determined to stay in . shape after disappointments at his two previous World Cup tournaments. In 2006, he . recovered from a broken metatarsal but lacked sharpness and erupted . with a red card during England's quarter-final defeat against Portugal. Four years ago he was also suffering niggling problems and fitness issues which limited his work in training. Hodgson . will hope this time it is different for Rooney and is sure to be . encouraged by the evidence since his squad assembled last week. Take a break: Rooney has a drink during the gruelling training session . Struggle: Rooney was not fully fit for the last World Cup in South Africa and it showed in his performance . Phil Jagielka revealed that players had been shedding more than a kilogram in each training session as they piled on extra clothing in preparation for the heat of the Amazon rainforest, where they will play Italy on June 14. 'We've all got three or four layers on,' said Jagielka. 'We've been told to weigh in before and after training. People are losing anything from a kilo to two kilos of sweat and that is going to be pretty much the case over there. 'We need to get used to playing in those conditions and hydrating properly as well. Training was quite difficult but at the same time enjoyable and it is quite exciting at the moment.'","England stars put through their paces with Rugby style drills .

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . In the search for success, Tottenham are by no means unique. Since Joe Lewis appointed his godson Daniel Levy as chairman in 2001, seven permanent managers have passed through White Hart Lane with an eighth now confirmed. In that time they have tired of George Graham (appointed pre-Levy), Glenn Hoddle, Jacques Santini, Martin Jol, Juande Ramos, Harry Redknapp, Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood. Earning his Spurs: Mauricio Pochettino (centre) has signed a five-year deal to become the new Tottenham boss . Atletico Madrid, La Liga champions and beaten Champions League finalists, are on to their 12th manager since the Levy regime began. Since Real Madrid’s ninth European Cup success, in 2002 at Hampden Park, another nine hugely respected coaches tried and failed to win the 10th. Carlo Ancelotti, Tottenham’s principal target to replace Sherwood, finally landed No 10. Barcelona, who have won six La Liga titles and three European Cups since Lewis bought into Spurs, have fired seven managers since Levy arrived. Inter Milan are on their 12th; Bayern Munich are on to their ninth with Pep Guardiola. Stuff happens. The problem for Tottenham is that no-one can quite work out what it is that they are trying to do.  Levy has gone down every conceivable route and yet the manager is never safe, never secure. It never feels like they have total boardroom support. Anyone who has ever received a payslip at Tottenham will tell you that this is the most political club in the Premier League.  Every member of staff is jostling for position or the ear of Levy as they grind their way through the season. Now that Mauricio Pochettino has become the manager on a five-year deal, the ambitions of this great club requires clarification. We know that fourth-placed finishes are not good enough because Harry Redknapp was fired in May 2012. You could make a case that they have never recovered. They have the sixth highest wage bill in the Barclays Premier League behind Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool. Last season, under the very different approaches of Villas-Boas and Sherwood, they still finished sixth, five points ahead of the deposed champions Manchester United. Sixth is about right. Although they have some history on their side, they are only the 10th-best supported team in the Barclays Premier League. You have been warned: Tim Sherwood (left) and Andre Villas-Boas have both been dismissed by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy (below right) in the past year . Glenn Hoddle (2001-2004) Jacques Santini (2004) Martin Jol (2004-2007) Juande Ramos (2007-2008) Harry Redknapp (2008-2012) Andre Villas-Boas (2012-2013) Tim Sherwood (2013-14) Mauricio Pochettino (2014-) *Permanent managers appointed by Levy only - he sacked George Graham in 2001 . Tottenham are a big club, just not as big as United and Arsenal, and certainly no bigger than Newcastle, City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Sunderland, Everton and Aston Villa. All of them had bigger average attendances than Spurs in the Barclays Premier League. It feels like they are searching for something that doesn’t really exist. History tells us that, but no-one can be sure what Levy wants for this club. They have tried various approaches over the years and will try again with another foreign coach. Pochettino just happens to be the latest. This is not an easy job to take, particularly with Tottenham’s record for losing patience with their managers. Graham was sacked and replaced with the . populist appointment of Hoddle before the FA Cup semi-final with Arsenal . in April 2001. He was sacked in September 2003. Populist appointment: But Spurs hero Glenn Hoddle's reign only lasted two years . Ruthless streak: Jacques Santini (left) lasted a few months and Martin Jol (right) was sacked during a match . When Jol was manager, Levy delivered a spanking new Porsche 911 to his house when all was well at White Hart Lane. Jol later discovered he was being sacked during a UEFA Cup tie at White Hart Lane against Getafe in 2007. Ramos, described as ‘a proper manager’ by Jonathan Woodgate when the defender arrived from Middlesbrough, lasted less than a year. The Spanish coach was the last man to win silverware at Spurs - the Carling Cup against Chelsea at Wembley in 2008 - but that wasn’t enough. After a poor start the following season he, too, was gone. Similarly, . Villas-Boas was fired when he lost the players. He promised that the . 6-0 defeat against Manchester City was a one-off and yet they were . beaten 5-0 by Liverpool at White Hart Lane a few weeks later. Juande you're a hero, the next you're gone: Juande Ramos won the Carling Cup in 2008 but was fired months later . The fourth is not with you: Harry Redknapp guided Tottenham into the Champions League for the first time but left the club after he failed to repeat the trick . Tottenham hope Pochettino will be able to unite a dressing room that was splintered under the leadership of Villas-Boas and Sherwood last season. That is the hope, that the Argentinian coach and his methods will be able to galvanise a group of talented players by the time the season starts on August 16. If it doesn’t, then Pochettino will simply become another name who tried and failed at Tottenham.","Glenn Hoddle, Jacques Santini, Martin Jol, Juande Ramos, Harry Redknapp, Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood are Levy's others .

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . Objecting to the referee only four days before the biggest fight in post-war Britain is just the latest quirk from George Groves and he will enjoy the war of nerves even though his appeal failed. Groves, who will exchange grudge-laden championship blows with Carl Froch at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night, is clearly a boxer with a difference. He split with his trainer just before his first tilt at Froch’s world super-middleweight title, and this is the same eccentric who has just signed for a German promoter on the eve of the rematch which will make him a superstar in Britain, win or lose. VIDEO Scroll down to watch George Groves working out . Failed: George Groves (left) lost his protest about Charlie Fitch refereeing Saturday's bout against Carl Froch . Rematch: Groves will fight Froch in front of a sell out crowd at Wembley Stadium on Saturday evening . No go: Groves objected to Fitch's appointment as his refereeing style may benefit Froch (left) Controversial: Referee Howard Foster stopped George Groves (left) in the original bout in November . Bad blood: The incident is the latest in a heated build-up between Froch (left) and Groves (right) Having insisted he would not fight Froch a second time if either the referee or the judges were British, he staged his late protest against American Charlie Fitch being the third man in the ring. Since Froch’s promoter Eddie Hearn had already asked for another US referee, David Reiss, to be replaced, this may have been as much a tit-for-tat reaction as a suspicion that Fitch’s style might help his opponent. Boxers usually leave the wheeling and dealing to their managers. When Groves dispensed with Adam Booth, who doubled as his trainer, on the November eve of Froch-Groves I, he then had to hire the lesser-known Paddy Fitzpatrick to work his corner. Fitzpatrick is now established as his trainer but Groves takes care of his own business. But why burden himself with the potentially distracting extra workload? ‘That part’s simple,’ he says. ‘I no longer trust anyone else to look after me and my money.’ So, . as if preparing to fight a three-time champion in Froch’s 12th . consecutive world title fight is not enough, the 26-year-old Groves took . out a British Boxing Board of Control licence to manage himself. Shortly . before his work-out in front of hundreds of fellow Londoners at the . Westfield shopping centre on Tuesday, he found time to lodge his . complaint about the ref. Popular: Hundreds of fans turned out at Westfield shopping centre to see Groves get put through his paces . Raring to go: Groves has predicted he'll knock out Froch in three rounds on Saturday night . He did so knowing that it might not be possible for a second substitute to be found and flown to London in time to undergo the British board’s stringent medical checks. By now the IBF, whose world . super-middleweight title is at stake along with a WBA belt, could be . forgiven for wishing they had not acceded to Groves’s petition for this . rematch following Froch’s controversial win first time out. Groves scorned legal representation at that hearing, paying for his trip to New Jersey and arguing his own case. He . then opposed the use of any British officials, so upset was he with the . premature stoppage inflicted by home referee Howard Foster. Gloves on: Froch's (right) rematch with Groves (left) will take place on Saturday at Wembley Stadium . Controversy: There has been bad blood between the pair since Froch was deemed to have beaten Groves in November . Again he succeeded, though by laying claim to the position of mandatory title challenger he shot himself in the foot financially. In these circumstances, the IBF stipulate that the defending champion receives up to 85 per cent of the purse. So while Froch can bank between £5-10million for Saturday night’s work, depending on the size of the pay-per-view audience, Groves is believed to be receiving around £1.5m. He shrugs and says: ‘After I’ve knocked out Carl my big pay-days will come.’ Groves has also vetoed one of the three foreign judges, because he hails from Poland, where Froch’s family have their roots. ‘Can’t be too careful,’ he grins. All smiles: Groves was in relaxed mood at his public work-out session just four days before his fight with Froch . Rejected: Froch's promoter Eddie Hearn has already turned down David Reiss as a possible official for the fight . Maybe it’s all part of the mind games with which he drove Froch into getting so angry and careless in their first fight that he lunged on to the blow which floored him in the first round. ‘I leave nothing to chance,’ Groves continues. ‘He needs to understand that his destiny is dawning. And while I’m sure he’s good enough to win I won’t allow him to win.’ Statements like that irritated the public too, five months ago. So having predicted, in the idiom of Muhammad Ali, the precise right-hand punch and the moment he would knock Froch down, he compares himself with The Greatest. ‘Ali was very unpopular in America for some time but he became an idol there and worldwide,’ he says. Do not discount more disputes at the final eyeball to eyeball press conference on Thursday. Froch-Groves II will be televised live on Sky Sports Box Office on Saturday night, at £16.95 .","George Groves has failed in his protest about referee Charlie Fitch .

"By . Tara Brady . Oscar voters ignored the Nelson Mandela biopic because 12 Years A Slave 'sucked up all the guilt about the black people', a British screenwriter has said. William Nicholson spent 15 years working on Nelson Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom which starred Idris Elba as the South African leader. However, he said he was devastated when the film didn't get the acclaim he was hoping for at the Academy Awards. William Nicholson spent 15 years working on Nelson Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom starring Idris Elba . Speaking at the Hay Festival, Nicholson said: '12 Years A Slave came out in America and that sucked up all the guilt about slavery that was available. 'They were so exhausted feeling guilty about slavery that I don't think there was much left over to be nice about our film. When it didn't become a winner it was devastating, actually, it was very distressing.' Mandela died in December last year on the night that the film had its Royal premiere in London which was attended by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Nicholson believes the leader's death also effected box office figures. Hollywood named the historical drama 12 Years a Slave starring Chiwetel Ejiofor best picture at the Oscars . 'We were deluged with Mandela stuff and after a week we all thought, please, take it away, we've heard enough about Mandela.' When the interviewer suggested that the Hay Festival should give out awards, Nicholson said 12 Years A Slave would always win. Nicholson wrote most of the speeches in the film because he said Mandela's speeches were often quite boring. He is also a novelist and writing books is his first love. The Long Walk to Freedom starring Idris Elba and Naomie Harris as Nelson and Winnie Mandela . The writer is now working on a television series. Idris Elba stars in Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom - a chronicle of Mandela's life journey from his childhood in a rural village through to his inauguration as the first democratically elected black president of South Africa. Mandela spent 27 years in an apartheid prison before becoming president and unifying his country with a message of reconciliation. His efforts to heal his country after its long history of division made him one of the world's most loved leaders, viewed by millions as a secular saint. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge learnt of Mandela's death at the royal premiere. Zindzi, Mandela's daughter was also present at the screening and when she heard the news, in a remarkable act of courage, she insisted the movie continue. Speaking after the premiere, Elba said: 'Literally halfway through the film Mandela had passed and there was sort of a slight buzz around the auditorium. 'Interestingly, the Duchess, Kate, sort of turned to me and looked at me as she had her phone and I wondered what was wrong with her because she looked quite emotional, but the film's very emotional. 'And my girlfriend looked at me and handed the phone and I looked down and Mandela had passed and it was on a website. 'It was just the most surreal moment. I looked back at Kate and Prince William and they were just in tears with me. It was just odd. Very odd. 'There's a moment in the film and I play older Mandela and he says this one line and it is 'just open the gate and let me free' - and I kid you not, that that was that line when we heard the news that was on the screen.' He and the film's producers decided he should make an announcement to guests who had gathered within the Odeon Leicester Square cinema in London. Win: Director Steve McQueen, winner of Best Picture for 12 Years a Slave  poses with his Academy Award . Debut: Lupita Nyong'o, best supporting actress winner for her role in 12 Years a Slave picks up her award . 'It only felt appropriate to say what had happened and honestly there was an audible gasp in the auditorium. 'Some people didn't know, they had their phones off. It was just surreal. 'It was very odd, after seeing the credits and I walk on stage. They were giving me a nice round of applause but it was just this moment where I had to say please sit down, and announcing the official speech from president Zuma of South Africa. It was just weird.' Hollywood named the historical drama 12 Years a Slave starring Chiwetel Ejiofor best picture at the 86th annual Academy Awards. Steve McQueen's slavery odyssey was based on Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir. It was hailed as a landmark corrective to the movie industry's virtual blindness to slavery, instead creating whiter tales like 1940 best-picture winner 'Gone With the Wind.' 12 Years a Slave is also the first best-picture winner directed by a black filmmaker. Lupita Nyong'o won best supporting actress for her indelible impression as the tortured slave Patsey. It was the feature film debut for the 31-year-old actress.","William Nicholson spent 15 years on Nelson Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom .

A New York City school teacher who set his heart on living in Manhattan has found a way to maximize the space inside his tiny studio apartment by thinking inside the box – and the finished result is now up for sale. In 2005, Eric Schneider, a third-grade teacher at Grace Church School, bought a 450-square-foot unit with a tiny kitchen on the Upper West Side for $235,000. ‘It was basically an open rectangular space,’ Schneider recalled in an interview with the site Fair Companies. ‘There wasn't much to it, there was just a couple of old closets, an old corner kitchen and that was it.’ Scroll down for video . Downsized: New York City teacher Eric Schneider bought a micro-apartment on the Upper West Side in 2005 for $235,000 . Magic cabinet: The homeowner turned to a pair of architects, who came up with an all-in-one blue cabinet to maximize the limited space . Bare necessities: The large blue box contains a full-size Murphy bed hidden behind a cabinet door . Convenient: A cubbyhole tucked away behind the bed doubles as a nightstand, complete with a reading lamp . But Schneider enjoyed entertaining, and his cramped quarters were ill-suited for having people over. That is when he turned to the team of architects Michael Chen and Kari Anderson, of Normal Projects, commissioning them to come up with a creative solution that would maximize his very limited space. ‘Initially . we were looking at different ways we could subdivide the spaces into . smaller spaces,’ said Chen, ‘but pretty quickly it became clear that . there wasn't really enough room to get like a real bedroom in here and . if you did then there wasn't really room to have a real living room . area.’ Chen . and Anderson came up with a 4-in-1 box that would serve as a bedroom, a . living room, an office and a closet throughout the day. The unit and its many uses have been captured by photographer Alan Tansey. The . cabinet featuring chemistry-lab countertops, Plexiglas panels and . medium-density fiberboard took a year to complete and cost Schneider . $70,000. Transformer: The space can be simultaneous a home office and a bedroom hidden behind a strategically placed panel providing privacy . All in one: This diagram of the Manhattan studio's floor plan shows all the uses of the cabinet . Party down: The box can been completely closed, with a small panel on the side used as a bar when the homeowner has people over . Gourmet kitchen: The miniscule apartment features an under-the-counter fridge and a half-width gas range . No inch wasted: The island separating the living room/bedroom/office from the kitchen doubles as a dining table comfortably sitting three . Schneider said he embraced the idea of downsizing and living a simpler, more stripped-down life. ‘I get overwhelmed by too much [stuff],’ he said with a chuckle. On the outside, the large blue structure the architects had erected in the middle of Eric Schneider’s micro-apartment appears bulky and unwieldy, but looks can be deceiving. The ‘magic cabinet’ contains a full-size Murphy bed, complete with a nightstand and lighting hidden behind a cabinet door, which then serves as a wall separating the sleeping quarters from the rest of the house. By pulling out a few inexpensive panels, Schneider can turn his bedroom into a work space with a small library, a relatively private guest room, or a living room. If the homeowner wants to entertain, the box can be closed up completely, with only a small flip-down panel on the side used as a bar. Moving on up: The unfolding apartment is now on the market for listing price of $469,000 . The team of architects dubbed their multipurpose cabinet 'the unfolding apartment,’ but Schneider, who spent a year living in Japan, lovingly refers to it as the ‘origami apartment.’ After a decade folding and unfolding the versatile box, Eric Schneider put his unit on the market this month for $469,000, the real estate site Curbed reported. Beside the central structure, the unit boasts a small kitchen with a half-width Viking gas range and a compact below-the-counter refrigerator.","School teacher Eric Schneider bought 450-square-foot apartment on Upper West Side and spent another $70,000 installing multipurpose cabinet .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A talented student at a top New York high school has allegedly committed suicide out of shame for cheating on her German-language exam. Omotayo Adeoye, 17, was allegedly caught peeking at her cellphone during a test at Harlem's High School for Math, Science and Engineering on Thursday afternoon. The humiliated teen reportedly ran to the bathroom after being yelled at by her teacher, but never returned to her desk. Witnesses said they saw the South Bronx resident hand her belongings to a stranger and jump into the Hudson River, forcing herself under water. She has not yet been found. Heartbreaking: Omotayo Adeoye, 17 (pictured left and right) was allegedly so ashamed about . cheating on her exam on Thursday that she jumped into the Hudson River . in New York and has not been found . New York Post reported the heartbreaking incident unfolded on Thursday afternoon when Adeoye's teacher Eva Malikova saw her cheating and snatched her phone away. A male classmate told The Post that Malikova began screaming at Adeoye, 'Oh, you shouldn’t be cheating! You guys shouldn’t be cheating! You guys are lying to yourselves!' When Adeoye burst into tears and apologized, Malikova reportedly snapped back: 'Oh, you are not really sorry. That’s not a sincere apology!' The Post reported that law enforcement sources confirmed the harsh exchange. Before asking to go to the bathroom, the promising senior scrawled a heart wrenching note on her exam: 'I just want to go away forever on the bottom of the river'. The humiliated teen then walked to the Hudson River’s edge at West 165th Street, put her ID down on the river bank and jumped into the water. Scene: Omotayo Adeoye, 17, was a senior at the High School for Math, Science and Engineering in Harlem, New York (pictured) Educator: High School for Math, Science and Engineering teacher Eva Malikova (pictured) caught Omotayo Adeoye cheating on Thursday . Witnesses told The Post that it appeared the girl - who can't swim - forced herself down. New York Daily News reported that witnesses pleaded with the girl to return to shore. Her school called authorities about 30 minutes to an hour after she disappeared. Emergency crews have scoured the river, but have found no sign of the biology whiz. Adeoye’s mother was too devastated to talk to New York Daily News on Friday night. 'She was a good girl, but I can’t talk about it,' she said. Malikova has not commented publicly. A Department of Education spokeswoman told The Post the department would do more to address mental health issues with students. 'We are conducting an investigation into this tragic incident, and we are taking immediate action,' she said. Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña offered her condolences. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and her school community,' she said  'This must be a call to action.' * For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, attend a local Samaritans branch, or visit www.samaritans.org.","Omotayo Adeoye was caught peeking at her cellphone during a test at New York's High School for Math, Science and Engineering on Thursday afternoon .

"By . Graham Smith . Updated: . 07:29 EST, 18 October 2011 . Actress Susan Sarandon has been slammed as 'positively obscene' after calling Pope Benedict XVI a 'Nazi' during a public interview at a New York film festival. The Oscar-winner was speaking in front of an audience at the Hamptons Film Festival on Saturday when she made her remark. Ms Sarandon was recounting the time she sent a copy of Sister Helen Prejean's book Dead Man Walking - the film adaptation of which she starred in and won an Oscar for - to 'the Pope' in the mid-1990s. Controversy: Susan Sarandon onstage at the Hamptons Film Festival in New York on Saturday. During the interview she called Pope Benedict XVI a 'Nazi' She clarified that she was referring to Pope John Paul II by adding: 'The last one, not this Nazi one we have now.' When her interviewer, actor Bob Batalan, . gently chided her for the remark, Ms Sarandon again repeated it to a . quiet murmur of laughter from the crowd. But Catholic groups have been quick to hit out at the 65-year-old, saying her quip 'bespeaks unparalleled ignorance'. Pope Benedict, 84, was born Joseph Ratzinger in Marktl, Germany, in 1927. As a 14-year-old during World War Two, he was forced into the Hitler Youth, even though his Bavarian parents despised the Third Reich. In 2006, a year after his election as pontiff, he visited the Auschwitz death camp where he expressed horror at the Holocaust. He also said that the Nazis, by attempting to destroy the Jews, were striking at the root of the Catholic faith. Catholic League president Bill Donohue said: 'Joseph Ratzinger [the Pope] was conscripted into the Nazi Youth the way every other 14-year-old German boy was at the time. 'Unlike most others, he not only refused to go to the compulsory meetings, he actually deserted the Hitler Youth. 'Which is precisely why Jews today regard him as a friend, not as an enemy.' The Anti-Defamation League, which fights anti-Semitism, called on Sarandon to apologise to the Catholic Community. In a statement, it said: 'Ms Sarandon . may have her differences with the Catholic Church, but that is no . excuse for throwing around Nazi analogies. 'Such words are hateful, vindictive and only serve to diminish the true history and meaning of the Holocaust.' Ms Sarandon, who was raised in New York . as a Roman Catholic, is known for her support of causes ranging from . hunger and Aids to opposing the U.S.-led war in Iraq. She was appointed a . UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1999. Blessing: German-born Pope Benedict was briefly a member of the Hitler Youth in the early 1940s when membership was compulsory . German-born Pope Benedict, formerly . Joseph Ratzinger, was briefly a member of the Hitler Youth in the early . 1940s when membership was compulsory, the Vatican has said. He deserted the military during World War Two and has said that as devout Catholics, his parents rejected Nazi ideology. During the interview, Ms Sarandon also touched on the Occupy Wall Street . protests currently taking place in lower Manhattan. She . also spoke of her former run-ins with the New York Police Department . over the shooting of a Guinean immigrant, Amadou Diallo, in 1999.",Catholic League decries Oscar-winner's remark as 'unparalleled ignorance'
"World War II soldier David Jackendoff jumped into Normandy on D-Day with the 101st Airborne Division . His daughter, Beth J. Harpaz, said her father would 'relive' his battle days each night at the dinner table but she did not pay attention . Jackendoff died in 1993 . Harpaz recently digitized as a swathe of wartime interviews her father conducted . She said that listening to them was like hearing the stories for the first time . This year marks the 70th anniversary of D-Day, which remains one of the world's most gut-wrenching and consequential battles . By . Associated Press . Every night at dinner when I was young, my dad fought World War II all over again. He'd parachuted into Normandy with the 101st Airborne on D-Day, went on to fight in Holland and Belgium, and he loved to tell war stories. But as a kid, I didn't care. I grew up in the 1960s and '70s, when anti-war sentiment about Vietnam was strong. It wasn't cool having a dad whose biggest accomplishment was being a soldier. It was only as an adult that I wished I'd paid more attention to those dinnertime tales. Fortunately, I have some extraordinary mementoes. Memories: Beth J. Harpaz - shown as a child after her graduation from elementary school in New York with her father, David Jackendoff - has released old interviews her dad did about World War II and his experience of D-Day, 70 years after the Normandy Landings . David Jackendoff, pictured while serving with the 101st Airborne Division in Europe, parachuted into Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944, and later fought in Holland and Belgium . American troops of the 4th Infantery Division ('Famous Fourth') land on Utah Beach on June 6, 1944, as Allied forces storm the Normandy beaches. D-Day is still one of the world's most gut-wrenching and consequential battles, as the Allied landing in Normandy led to the liberation of France and marked the turning point in the Western theater of World War II . Dad, who died in 1993, was interviewed on . radio shows in 1944, shortly after D-Day, then in 1945 at a military . hospital, and finally on local TV for the 40th anniversary of D-Day. This year I digitized the old-media recordings — 78 RPM records and a . 1984 videotape. When I played them for the first time in years, I heard what I hadn't heard as a kid: how tough he was, how hard it was, how brave these soldiers were. Here, in his words, is what it was like to jump out of a plane shortly after midnight on June 6, 1944, land behind enemy lines and help launch the offensive that ultimately defeated Adolf Hitler. 'We hit French soil just a little over six hours before the first ship hit the beach,' Cpl. David Jackendoff said on a show called An American Eagle in Britain, taped by the BBC on Aug. 26, 1944. 'I was in plane No. 5 that went over to knock out coastal batteries that were trained onto the beach. Our plane was hit by some of that German 20 millimeter flak. 'We had to bail out as soon as we got into French territory.' Once on the ground, he said, 'a group of us got together, nine to be exact'. As they headed toward their target, 'we were hampered, I'll say, by some German machine-gun nests'. This 1940s era photo provided by Beth J. Harpaz shows her father David Jackendoff, in Army uniform, posing with his parents, Harry and Bella, in New York. Jackendoff parachuted into Normandy with the 101st Airborne on D-Day . Monumental: On D-Day, June 6, 1944, a landing craft just vacated by invasion troops points towards a fortified beach on the Normandy Coast. American soldiers wade to shore fighting heavy machine gun fire from the Germans . With four men on one side of him and four on the other, 'I told them to crawl up as close as we could'. 'And when I whistled, everybody was to throw a grenade,' he recalled in 1984 on WNBC-TV. 'When we got there, all we saw was a lot of wrecks and dead Germans.' He won a Bronze Star for leading the charge that silenced the nest, without regard to his personal safety. But his account 40 years later hinted at the fear and regret. 'You didn't know what was around you,' he said. 'You didn't know where you were. You didn't know if the fellow next to you was friend or enemy, all in blackface.' He got back to his command post four days later, but not everyone made it. 'A mortar shell landed amongst four of the fellows including our top sergeant and killed them all,' he said. 'As you go along, you pass bodies, and you just have to keep going.' Dad fought with the 101st for 37 straight days in France. In September 1944, he went to Holland, to Operation Market Garden, a battle depicted in the movie 'A Bridge Too Far'. In December, they dug in for the siege of Bastogne, Belgium, part of the Battle of the Bulge. He earned a second Bronze Star, two presidential citations and a Purple Heart. Though he died in 1993, wartime radio interviews and a TV interview conducted by David Jackendoff on D-Day preserved his stories . His 1945 interview with WOR was done at Halloran General Hospital, an Army hospital on Staten Island, New York, as he recuperated from a bullet wound that crippled his right arm. Looking back, he seems to me like a character straight out of a black-and-white World War II movie. He smoked like a chimney, drank like a fish and lived every day like it was his last — which is one way to prepare yourself to jump from a plane into a war zone. For the rest of his life, his war buddies were his best friends; nobody else could understand what they'd been through. And he loved Calvados, the French apple brandy he first tasted in Normandy. Listening to the recordings now, I'm struck by his nonchalance. As he described encountering machine-gun fire, he said, 'That held us up for a while'. Commando troops coming ashore from landing craft during the Normandy landings in France in June 1944 . When the interviewer asked, 'One vital question: Did you get them?' he answered simply, 'Yes, sir'. And there was this memorable aside: 'I love hand grenades.' I have a 16-year-old son now, about the age I was when I didn't want to hear my father's stories. My dad died before this boy was born, and as we listened together to his grandpa's voice, I could see the look of amazement on his face. 'Your dad was cool,' he finally said. Yeah, he was.","World War II soldier David Jackendoff jumped into Normandy on D-Day with the 101st Airborne Division .

"By . Sara Malm . Michelle Obama encouraged rural Chinese students not to let humble beginnings stop them from aiming high, as she spoke during a visit to a school in southwestern China today. Mrs Obama drew from her experiences, speaking of how she did not let her own modest upbringing in Chicago stand in the way of completing a law degree at Harvard, as she addressed students in remote Chinese communities via webcam. The First Lady quoted her own mother Marian Robinson, who is accompanying her and her daughters on the trip, saying that ‘a good education is something that no one can take away from you.’ Scroll down for video . Tiger mother: Michelle Obama had the opportunity to practices Tai chi with students at Chengdu No. 7 High School during her visit in Chengdu, Sichuan province today . One step at a time: The First Lady of the U.S. is given instructions by a tai chi teacher in the grounds of the school in Chengdu . Mrs Obama did not let her kitten heels and dress stop her from taking part in the tai chi session as she mentally prepared herself before speaking to students from across the province about overcoming humble beginnings . The First Lady’s speech, on the last . leg of a six-day, three-city tour of China, was delivered to a stadium . of 700 students at a high school in Chengdu, Sichuan province, as well . as to 12,000 rural students through satellite-enabled distance-learning . technology. Mrs Obama cited . herself, basketball star LeBron James and Starbucks’ CEO Howard Schultz . as examples of people with modest backgrounds who have succeeded in life . during her 15-minute presentation at Chengdu No. 7 High School in . Sichuan province. ‘Because . in America, we believe that no matter where you live or how much money . your parents have, or what race or religion or ethnicity you are, if you . work hard and believe in yourself, then you should have a chance to . succeed,’ she said. ‘You . see, the truth is that I grew up like many of you. My mom, my dad, my . brother and I, we lived in a tiny apartment in Chicago. ‘My father worked at the local water plant and we didn't have much money, but our little home was bursting with love.’ So how do we do this? Mrs Obama looks momentarily confused as the students practice the ancient Chinese martial art behind her . Makign friends: The week-long trip to China, during which Mrs Obama is accompanied by her two daughters Sasha and Malia and her own mother, the First Lady is focusing on education and building non-political bridges between China and the U.S. You start, I'll follow: Mrs Obama laughts with the students after practicing a tai chi exercise with them at Chengdu No.7 High School in Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan province . She . said persevering was not easy, but added that ‘whenever I got tired or . discouraged, I would just think about how hard my parents were working . for me. And I would remember something my mother always told me — she . said, “A good education is something that no one can take away from . you.”‘ . As her visit to China . comes to a close, Mrs Obama stuck to her promise of not addressing any . complex political issues during her stay, and instead promoting cultural . exchange and education. White . House representatives hope that the visit, during which Mrs Obama is . accompanied by her daughters Sasha, 12, and Malia, 15, as well as her . mother Marian Robinson, will build non-political bridges between China . and the U.S. ‘We can start . with some soft issues to push for more engagements between China and the . United States,’ said Zhao Kejin, professor of international relations . of Tsinghua University. Access . to education remains a major challenge for Chinese students in rural, . remote and often impoverished communities, where per-student funding is . usually a fraction of that in urban schools. Far fewer rural students . can make it to top-notch Chinese colleges than their urban peers. The . elite high school in Chengdu — where most of its graduates pursue . college education in prestigious Chinese universities or overseas — also . has a reputation for using technology to bring quality education to . impoverished remote regions. The . speech was followed with a question-and-answer session with 58 students . in a classroom and 20,000 more students piped in via satellite . technology. She later observed a student demonstration of the . traditional Chinese exercise regime tai chi and tried a few moves.

Inspirational: Mrs Obama told students to aim high and get a good education despite humble roots during a 15-minute presentation at Chengdu No. 7 High School in Sichuan province on Tuesday . Encouraging: Michelle Obama used her own modest background and subsequent journey towards a law degree at Harvard as an example of succeeding under adverse conditions, during her presentation . Mrs. Obama has largely avoided thorny, political issues on her China trip, . although she made a strong statement on behalf of free expression, . choice of religion and unfettered access to information as ‘universal . rights,’ during a speech Saturday at the Stanford Center at Peking . University in Beijing. China . has some of the world's tightest restrictions on Internet discourse. Mrs. Obama's remarks did not call out China directly and have not drawn . any governmental protest. But that part of her speech has been kept out . of all official Chinese media reports. On Tuesday, she once again stressed how Americans value the freedoms of speech and belief. ‘We . also believe that everyone is equal, and that we all have the right to . say what we think and worship as we choose, even when others don't like . what we say or don't always agree with what we believe,’ Mrs. Obama . said. While in Beijing, the . first lady visited an elite high school, where more than 30 American . students are studying as exchange students, and she held a private . discussion with a handful of Chinese professors, students and parents. Mrs. Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, before Xi flew . to The Hague for a nuclear security summit and held a meeting with . President Barack Obama on Monday. She spent a full day with Xi's wife . Peng Liyuan earlier Friday, in what many Chinese analysts described as . ‘first lady diplomacy’ to help soften the US-China relationship.

Down in 1992, it was a ramshackle shell needing complete renovation. More . than 20 years later, it has been transformed into a perfect family home . and has all the luxury trappings you would expect in the light of Tim's . successful business career founding the Snappy Snaps photographic . chain. The couple estimate they have spent more than £500,000 . renovating the property near Twyford, now on the market for . £2.95 million. Back in 1992 this idyllic Berkshire home, Ruscombe Down, needed complete renovation . They moved here from their  two-bedroom flat above . the Snappy Snaps store in Chiswick, West London. Tim, 58, set up the . company in 1982 with schoolfriend Don Kennedy. The pair were working . for  the American franchise print company Kall-Kwik and spotted a gap in . the market for quick photographic printing. 'We learnt a lot about franchising from Kall-Kwik and were looking for a business we could franchise ourselves,' explains Tim. On . a trip to Canada, Don spotted  a one-hour photo-processing machine . gathering crowds in a mall. It sparked an idea and the pair invested . £70,000 in a similar machine sourced from Japan and opened their first . store, named Snappy Snaps at Tim's suggestion, in Queensway, West . London. More stores nearby quickly followed, in Kensington High . Street, Notting Hill Gate and Gloucester Road. After testing out the . concept for two years and realising there was a demand for fast . printing, the pair decided to franchise the business. By the 1990s they had 155 franchise stores - three of which have been run by Tim's wife Helen over the years. 'That . was our peak - just before the great switchover from analogue to . digital,' says Tim, who explains that they made sure the business . survived the shift by diversifying into canvases, posters and printable . gifts such as mugs and mouse mats. Tim and Helen MacAndrews at their home which is transformed and has all the luxury trappings . Last year he and Don sold the . business to the Timpson shoe repair chain for a reported figure of . between £2 million and £3 million, although the terms of the sale  mean . Tim is unable to confirm or deny this figure. 'We had no great plan . at the beginning - we had no idea what  we were doing at the time,' says . Tim modestly, although the schoolboy friends had shown entrepreneurial . flair from the time they first met aged 13. 'I always had a paper round . and I worked at a paying-out booth  at White City dog track when I was . in my teens,' says Tim, a trained chartered accountant. The pair also set up a T-shirt printing business while at school, selling customised shirts to their fellow sixth-formers. They converted the loft to create two extra en suite bedrooms and built a swimming pool and tennis courts . Ruscombe . Down, which is set in eight acres, was built in 1926 by the Godsall . family from the neighbouring Haines Hill estate. It was for one of their . sons, who had suffered shell shock after the First World War. When the . MacAndrews bought it, for £500,000, it had been empty for years . following the deaths of its previous owners. The couple spotted it in an . advert in Country Life magazine and fell in love straight away. 'It . was the first house we looked at outside London and I don't remember . viewing any others,' says Tim. 'It was amazing, like a time warp, with . crazy 1950s wallpaper and a higgledy-piggledy maze of rooms on the . ground floor,' adds Helen, 53. As well as rewiring, they knocked . through the tiny kitchen, and servants' rooms and larders, to create a . large, open-plan kitchen/diner with an adjoining conservatory and a . study. The Mark Wilkinson kitchen set them back £80,000. They converted . the loft to create two extra en suite bedrooms and built a swimming pool . and tennis courts and landscaped the garden. Now that the couple's . children  - Ben, 24, Hattie, 23, and Holly, 21 - have all flown the . nest, the couple  have decided to downsize.

"By . Jennifer Newton . An Indian official has mocked questions over the gang rape and murder of two teenage girls telling journalists 'What's it to you?' Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav made the comments as police announced they had made a fifth arrest in the case, which saw the two girls attacked and then hanged from a tree in the state. It has also been revealed that two police officers have also been fired for failing to investigate when one of the girl's fathers reported them as missing. Scroll down for video .

The distraught father of one of the victims covers his face in despair after his daughter was raped and then hanged from a tree . Police escort one of the girls' mothers to the scene where the victims were discovered in Katra in Uttar Pradesh state . Sheer horror: Two teenage girls were found hanging from a tree in Katra village in Uttar Pradesh after they were allegedly raped and killed by a gang of men - including at least one police officer . 'Then why are you worried? What's it to you?' he added. Officers Malik says the fifth arrest in the case came early today with police facing growing criticism for a series of rapes in Uttar Pradesh state, which has a long reputation for lawlessness. The three other men arrested are cousins in their 20s from an extended family, and face murder and rape charges, they added. But in a country with a long history of tolerance for sexual violence, the firings yesterday and the minister's comments were not a surprise to many in India. People in New Delhi march in protest against the government of Uttar Pradesh, where the two girls were found hanged after being gang raped . Protesters carried placards demanding the immediate arrest of all of those accused in the gang rape case . Untouchables: The family belongs to the Dalit community, also called 'untouchables' and considered the lowest rung in India's age-old caste system . Last month Mr Yadav's father, a former chief minister and head of the state's ruling party also told an election rally that the party opposed a law calling for gang rapists to be executed. 'Boys will be boys,' Mulayam Singh Yadav said. 'They make mistakes.' Kavita Krishnan, a women's rights activist, said such comments make clear to police that rape isn't taken seriously by officials. She called the chief minister' comments 'a trivialisation of rape.' The gang rape, with video of the girls' corpses hanging from a mango tree and swaying gently in a breeze, was the top story Friday on India's relentless 24-hour news stations. Official statistics say about 25,000 . rapes are committed every year in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people. But activists say that number is very low, since women are often . pressed by family or police to stay quiet about sexual assaults. Indian . police and politicians, who for decades had done little about sexual . violence, have faced growing public anger since the December 2012 . gang-rape and murder of a young woman on a moving New Delhi bus, an . attack that sparked national outrage over the treatment of women. On Friday, the state's former chief minister lashed out at the ruling government. Outrage: The attack is the latest of a string of appalling rape cases that have sent shockwaves through India in recent years sparking protests across the country . Mayawatie, who only uses one name said: 'There is no law and order in the state. It is the law of the jungle. Hours . later, the chief minister ordered that suspects in the attack be tried . in special ""fast track"" courts, to get around India's notoriously slow . judicial system. The girls, who were 14 and 15, were raped in the tiny village of Katra, about 180 miles from Lucknow. Police say they disappeared Tuesday night after going into fields since their house has no toilet. The father of one girl went to police that night to report them missing, but he said they refused to help. When . the bodies were discovered the next day, angry villagers silently . protested the police inaction by refusing to allow the bodies to be cut . down from the tree. The villagers allowed authorities to take down the corpses after the first arrests were made on Wednesday. The girls were Dalits, from the community once known as ""untouchables"" in India's ancient caste system. While . sexual assaults are reported across India, there have been a string of . high-profile attacks in just the past few days in Uttar Pradesh. On Thursday, police arrested three men for brutally attacking the mother of a rape victim after she refused to withdraw her complaint. The attack, in the town of Etawah, followed the May 11 rape of the woman's teenage daughter. A local man was arrested after the mother filed a complaint with authorities.

"By . Kirk Maltais . The head of a smuggling ring accused of bringing more than $60 million of cocaine into the United States was arrested this week as part of a sting that pinched a total of forty-four people. Salvador Lemus, 65, was arrested in Chester County, Pennsylvania on Wednesday, where he ran a landscaping business. Lemus, also known by his nickname 'El Vejo' (The Old One), is accused of being the head of a family crime syndicate that trafficked cocaine out of the family's home, in East Marlborough Township. Authorities claim that Lemus had ties with 'La Familia', a notorious Mexican cartel. He was assisted in his business by his family, including his son and nephew. Salavador Lemus, 65, a Mexican-born US Citizen, is accused of being the head of a crime family smuggling millions of dollars worth of cocaine into the United States . Lemus' illicit activities were caught by law enforcement after Operation Telarana, an endeavor where authorities wiretapped Lemus's cellphone. Prior to this, Lemus had kept the same phone number during the 20 years he had lived and operated in Chester County. 'My phone, my phone - nobody can track it.' Lemus allegedly told an associate after it was suggested that he change his phone number. 'I have 20 years with my number.' Lemus' drug-dealing activity was well-known to authorities. However, prior to the successful execution of Operation Telarana, law enforcement found difficulty getting information from other Mexican residents in the area, who feared Lemus and his ties to the cartel. 'These are groups that kill cops, kill prosecutors, kill judges and don’t think twice about killing civilians,' Thomas Hogan, District Attorney in Chester County, Pennsylvania told CBS3. Thomas Hogan, District Attorney in Chester County, Pennsylvania, showing a large chart of arrested participants in a drug smuggling ring led by Salvador Lemus . However, the operation commenced once confidential informants inside of the smuggling ring began to cooperate with authorities. In addition, hundreds of phone calls were recorded in an effort to build a case against Lemus. According to Hogan, the dealers managed to evade the attention of the authorities by holding down day jobs while selling the drugs at night. 'These guys are going to be working in mushroom houses. They are going . to be working in blue collar jobs. They are going to be working in auto . repair shops. They are going to be working in landscaping jobs during . the day,' Hogan said. Salvador Lemus, shown as the top figure in a drug conspiracy that resulted in over $60 million worth of cocaine being sold in America over the course of 20 years. According to the Phildelphia Inquirer, Lemus' group received the drugs from the Guanajuato region of Mexico, where it was then fed through hubs in the United States like Houston, Texas, and Charlotte, North Carolina. Once arriving in Chester County, the drugs were then sold in Baltimore, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and the surrounding areas. Lemus has been charged with 600 counts, mainly conspiracy, possession, and distribution. His bail is set at $1 million.","Salvador Lemus, 65, arrested in law enforcement takedown of cocaine smuggling ring .

"By . Alex Greig . A Pittsburgh dog owner was horrified when she received a call from her local PetCo to inform her that her beloved dog was about to undergo anesthesia for wounds she sustained during grooming. Carissa Luther dropped her dog Lucy off at the Greensburg Petco to have her fur groomed on Thursday afternoon. A few hours later, she received a call from a veterinarian to tell her that the dog was about to be anesthetized before having two separate injuries stitched up. Injured: Lucy went for a haircut and came home the following day with 20 stitches . Wounds: Lucy has a nasty gash on her belly and most of the skin on her front leg had to be removed, says Luther . Trainee: Luther says she would have thought twice about leaving her dog at PetCo if she'd known an inexperienced groomer would be handling her dog . 'For her to be in such harm and be in so much pain from something like that, I think it's just appalling,' Luther told WTAE. 'For anyone to drop their pet off and get a call they're at the animal hospital, nobody should have to get that call, especially from a groomer,' Luther said. The small dog had to have 20 stitches on her abdomen and front leg and is on medication for the pain. More than anything, Luther wants to know just how her dog could have sustained such serious injuries from a simple grooming session. Angry: Luther says she didn't even know that such serious injuries could be caused by grooming tools . Pain: Lucy had to stay overnight at the vet and is now on pain medication for her injuries . Ongoing: Lucy has to return to the vet for further treatment next week . 'The vet said this is one of the worst cases they've ever seen, for this to happen not only on her stomach but to most of the skin to be taken off her front leg, I think is completely ridiculous,' Luther said. PetCo has accepted responsibility for the injuries Lucy sustained and told WTAE that it was an 'unfortunate incident.' The company has also committed to paying for Lucy's vet bills. Luther said staff at the Greensburg PetCo told her the person who injured her dog was a trainee pet groomer. 'I was told yesterday it was somebody who was learning how to do this, which I think should’ve been mentioned to me before I left the dog in their care. Had I known that, maybe I would’ve taken her away if I knew it wasn't a trained professional,' she told WTAE.","Carissa Luther dropped her dog Lucy off at a Pittsburgh PetCo to be groomed .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Gothic cathedrals, such as the Ulm Minster in Germany, pictured, with soaring spires are built with a low centre of gravity to keep them upright . Gothic cathedrals, with their soaring spires and structural beauty, were once pioneering architectural wonders - appearing to defy the laws of gravity. And now the principles of these awe-inspiring buildings could help build a stairway to the skies. Engineer Peter Debney has proposed a theory that borrows the methods by which cathedrals control their centre of gravity - by tapering at the top - and applied it to the concept of an elevator that take humans into space. The space elevator concept was first suggested by Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1895. In principle it sounds simple - extend a tether from the surface of Earth into space and travel along it. In practice, however, it’s difficult to construct. There are few materials strong enough, or that can be manufactured in sufficient quantities, to create a cable long enough to reach. Secondly, the tether would need to be anchored at a geostationary station, as well as attached to a  counterweight further out into space, to ensure it doesn’t break and keep the system balanced. When building any tall structure - from gothic cathedrals to skyscrapers, and eventually a space elevator - the sturdiness and balance comes from its centre of gravity. In humans, for example, the centre of gravity is around the stomach. The higher this centre is above the ground, the harder it is balance. However, if the centre of gravity is lowered, it becomes easier to balance and maintain a sturdy footing. Engineer Peter Debney proposes a system that uses these principles to create a space elevator. Firms could lower a cable from a satellite in geostationary orbit. A counterweight would balance the system, pictured. The cable would taper, to adjust the centre of mass and it would sit on the Equator, to minimise the gravitational pull . All tall buildings, from gothic cathedrals to skyscrapers, stay upright because their centre of gravity is as low as possible. The centre of gravity determines balance, for example. This graphic shows that by digging deep foundations, and securing them with piles of metal and a concrete raft, this centre is underground . This is the same theory that applies to all tall and 'super-tall' buildings. By creating strong, far-reaching foundations deep into the Earth, the centre of gravity is shifted from above the ground, to below it. Structural engineer Peter Debney, from Arup explained to the MailOnline: ‘The gravity we experience here on the Earth's surface is the result of two components. ‘The first is our distance from the centre of the Earth, that is, the Earth's centre of gravity. ‘As the Earth is not actually a sphere, the spin of the Earth causes there to be more material at the Equator and less at the poles, this means the Equatorial radius is higher than the Polar one. 'Thus the force of gravity is least at the Equator and maximum at the North and South Poles.’ In addition to that, Debney explained that because the Earth is spinning, there is a centrifugal force acting on everything, which is maximum at the Equator and zero at the poles. Engineer Peter Debney proposes a system that uses the principles from gothic cathedral and skyscraper architecture to create a space elevator. He claims firms could lower a cable from a satellite that is say in geostationary orbit above the Earth. A counterweight, such as a suitably-sized asteroid, would be used at the other end of the cable to balance the system. The cable would need to be made of graphene, or carbon nanotubes, because these materials are capable of holding heavier loads and bearing their own weight more effectively. By anchoring the cable at the Equator, the gravitational acceleration on the system would be at a minimum. The elevator itself would then extend from low to high Earth orbit, and would be kept taught by tidal forces. The cable would taper, to adjust the centre of mass, but from the top down, rather than the bottom up, as seen in pyramids and spires. ‘Combine these two effects together and the effective gravitational acceleration is least at the Equator, and maximum at the poles.’ He continued: ‘If the centrifugal force from the Earth's rotation offsets the force of gravity; what happens when you get higher up a tall building? ‘The first effect is that gravity is reduced as you are now further from the centre of gravity, and the second is that centrifugal force increases. ‘There will, therefore, come a point when the centrifugal force exactly cancels out gravity. 'If you are on the Equator, this occurs at a height of approximately 18,000 km. ‘This height is commonly known as the geostationary orbit, because if you position a satellite at this altitude over the equator and give it the right velocity, it will orbit within a 24-hour period, and remain over a fixed point on the Earth.’ Debney said the solution is to place a satellite in geostationary orbit, and lower a cable from it to the ground. But, he continued, as soon as the cable lowers, it changes the centre of gravity of the satellite, placing it at a lower orbit and causing it to move relative to the ground. To keep the whole thing in orbit, Debney added a cable would then also need to be extended up at the same time, to keep the system balanced. Because this would make a nonlinear system, the cable would need to extend out almost twice as far as it is brought down. The alternative is to use a counterweight, such as a suitably sized asteroid, beyond geostationary to balance the cable and save the excessive length. The cable would also need to made of a material that can hold its own weight at such heavy loads, such as graphene or carbon nanotubes. In 2012, Tokyo-based company Obayashi Corporation announced plans to build an operational space elevator by 2050, concept image pictured. It uses similar technology proposed by Debney, and seen in supertall buildings . The same principle applies to buoys, pictured. The taller they are, the stronger the counterweight needs to be to keep it afloat. Both buoys, and spires on churches, taper towards the top to reduce the load on the materials beneath it, more evenly distribute the weight, and reduce the wind resistance . Although the lift would cause the weight to distribute, the cable would be able to maintain being top heavy, in the same way Seattle's Space Needle, pictured, does, due to the lower centre of gravity . Graphene has a breaking length of 3,568 km, but because breaking length assumes a constant force of gravity, and at that altitude the force is lower, this allows for extra length. Debney continued that the space elevator cable will instead need to be a ribbon that tapers. Just as the pyramids and spires of a cathedral taper towards the top to support the weight efficiently - the cable would need to taper towards the ground. ‘It is almost certain that early versions of the space elevator will not reach the ground but instead extend from low to high Earth orbit,’ said Debney. ‘These will be kept taught by the tidal forces induced by the two ends orbiting at different altitudes: low orbits move at a higher angular velocity than high orbits. ‘Curiously, despite the high orbits having a lower angular velocity, they have a higher tangential velocity, which means that if you want to go round the Earth slower you need to speed up.’ The accidental damage risks of installing a space elevator include space debris and micrometeorites, but the width of the ribbon cable, according to Debney, would minimise the risk from these impacts. The risk from the falling cable is less than might be considered, too, as the ribbon would be 'both light and have a reasonable air resistance'. Any cable falling from this height should burn up before reaching the ground and studies have shown that the whiplash effect experienced by upper parts of the cable are likely to snap sections and put them into orbit for recovery later. In 2012, Tokyo-based company Obayashi Corporation announced plans to build an operational space elevator by 2050.","Cathedrals and skyscrapers stay upright by lowering their centre of gravity .
They do this by placing the centre underground, counteract the height .
A space elevator would use a similar principle using an anchor at Earth's Equator, with a counterweight in space to keep it balanced .
The cable would taper, similar to how spires do, to increase load-bearing .
These logistics have been proposed by structural engineer Peter Debney .
Using similar techniques, a Japanese firm plans to launch a space elevator by 2050 ."
"By . Francesca Chambers . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has dramatically dropped in size after having weight loss surgery last year. At a recent town hall Christie told a constituent he is 'much smaller now than he used to be' but did not give a clear indication of how much weight he had lost. Experts told Politico this week that Christie appears to have lost a stunning 86 pounds and counting since he secretly had Lap-Band surgery in February of last year, bringing his weight to roughly 236 pounds, down from an estimated 322 pounds. Experts estimate that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, pictured here last Wednesday, has lost more than 85 pounds over the last year . Before and After: On the left is a photo of Chris Christie at an event on August 1, 2012 before his weight loss surgery. He is pictured on the right at an event more than a year after the surgery on April 9, 2014 . Christie, 51, is a presumed 2016 Republican presidential candidate. A former White House physician told CNN last year in February that she thought Christie was literally unfit for the position. 'I’m worried about this man dying in office,' Dr. Connie Mariano said.. 'It’s almost like a time bomb waiting to happen unless he addresses those issues before running for office.' Christie attacked her after the remarks as 'another hack that just wants five minutes on TV.' 'I find it fascinating that a doctor in Arizona who has never met me, never examined me, never reviewed my medical history or records, knows nothing about my family history, could make a diagnosis from 2,400 miles away,' Christie said. 'You don’t have to be a doctor to look at him and see that he has a problem with weight,' she shot back. The next week Christie got the Lap-Band surgery, a secret he kept out of the press for nearly two months. This photo of Christie, left, with President Barack Obama, right, was taken on September 4, 2011 at Newark Liberty Airport after the president's visit to Paterson and the surrounding areas to look at the aftermath of Hurricane Irene . Christie said he had the elective surgery to restrict his food intake because he wanted to get healthy for his family's sake. 'It has nothing to do the performance of my job,' he told People magazine afterward, echoing comments he made a few months prior in an interview with Barbara Walters. 'I think people have watched me for a number of weeks during Hurricane Sandy doing 18-hour days, and getting right back up the next day and still being just as effective in the job, so I don’t really think that would be a problem,' Christie said. Politicos have speculated his potential presidential plans had something to do with the decision as well, a claim Christie also denies. 'My decisions about anything to do with my career are based upon what I think is best for me and best for my family,' he said when his surgery finally became public. 'Whatever size I happen to be when I have to make a decision about what to do next in my career, I doubt that'll play any role or effect in what I decide to do.' In this May 2013 photo can be seen Christie visiting the boardwalk and pier of Seaside Heights, New Jersey, with Prince Harry two months after his secret surgery . Christie is pictured here during at the Economic Club of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois on February 11, 2014, roughly a year after his Lap-Band surgery . And here is Christie today in Little Ferry, New Jersey, at the Rebuild by Design competition created by President Barack Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force . Regardless of the motivation for his surgery, Christie's frame has noticeably shrunk throughout the last year and a half - something a constituent pointed out last week at one of the Governor's town halls. 'By the way, you do look fantastic,' a female constituent told him. 'God bless you,' Christie told her. The Republican Governor noted that he's lost so much weight, his wife thinks he should buy new suits. 'But I’m on a budget. I gotta be careful, you know?' Christie told the woman. An adviser to Christie told ABC two months after the surgery that the New Jersey Governor had already lost 30 pounds. An expert who spoke to NBC . in February believes Christie weighed more than 400 pounds before the surgery and . has lost 90 to 100 pounds. That puts his current weight at 320 pounds, . give or take, the expert said. Even at his current weight, whatever it may be, Christie is still considered obese based on his body fat level. The experts who spoke with Politico estimated that his Body Mass Index is 33. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a healthy level of body fat is 18.5 - 24.9. Anything above that is considered overweight or obese. Dr. Jessica Barfield, a doctor who specializes in weight management at Loyola Center for Metabolic Surgery . and Bariatric Care, told Politico that Christie is dropping weight at a healthy rate, however. 'I think he is making progress, . absolutely, for what I would expect this at this point of the process,' she said. Christie also seems to be taking his weight loss progress in stride. 'Rome wasn't unbuilt in a day,' Christie said of his physique in February.","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie underwent weight loss surgery in February of last year .

"By . Jill Reilly . An Indian woman was gang raped, strangled and then had acid poured on her face in an apparent attempt to hide her identity. Police are now trying to find out the identity of the woman who is believed to be aged about 22, after her body was discovered in a field in Aithpura, close to the city of Bareilly on Saturday. Her face had later been mutilated with acid and petrol, apparently in an attempt to hide her identity. Protestors shout slogans as police use a water cannon as they protest against two rape of two teenage girls last week in India . The result of a post-mortem examination released on Monday showed the woman had been assaulted, made to drink acid and then strangled, according to the Press Trust of India news agency, reports The Independent. Her face had later been mutilated with acid and petrol, apparently in an attempt to hide her identity. The attack took place about 60 miles from the village where two girls were gang raped and hanged from a tree last week. Today police used water cannons to disperse hundreds of women who were protesting against a rise in violence against women. Three men were arrested for the crime in Uttar Pradesh that underscored the enduring culture of sexual assault in India and the capacity for appalling violence between Hindu castes .

An Indian woman, left, one among the protestors demonstrating outside the office of Uttar Pradesh state chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, demanding that he crack down on an increasing number of rape and other attacks on women and girls, . The protesters in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, were demonstrating outside the office of the top elected official, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, demanding that he crack down on an increasing number of rape and other attacks on women and girls. Hundreds of police officers, including female officers, pushed and shoved the protesters before deploying water cannons to disperse them. The protesters also demanded that the government curb police indifference, which they said was encouraging attacks on women. Police failed to take any action when the father of one of the girls reported to police that the two cousins were missing. Two police officers were fired for dereliction of duty after the girls were found gang-raped and killed. Shocking: The dead bodies of two teenage sisters hanging from a mango tree in Uttar Pradesh . Victims: Teenage cousins Pushpa, left, and Murti, right, were raped and murdered before their bodies were hung from a tree . One of their fathers said police took more than 12 hours to respond to his report that the girls were missing. He said if the police had acted promptly, they could have been rescued. Yadav has recommended a federal inquiry, but his government has been widely accused of a lackadaisical approach toward women's safety. India has a long history of tolerance of sexual violence, but the attack on the girls has caused outrage across the nation. Activists and ordinary people said it was as if nothing had changed since the December 2012 fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old woman aboard a moving bus in New Delhi, India's capital. The nationwide outcry following that attack led the federal government to push through legislation doubling prison terms for rapists to 20 years and criminalizing voyeurism, stalking and the trafficking of women. The law also makes it a crime for officers to refuse to register cases when complaints are made.","Police are trying to find out the identity of woman believed to be aged 22 .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Boston-area mother found dead last month withdrew a restraining order against her abusive husband only days before she was killed, it has been revealed. Florence Beaulieu, 37, was found dead May 16 in her Brockton apartment by one of her four children, according to reports, and husband Jean-Michel Beaulieu, 42, was arrested Sunday at the Vermont border while trying to flee to Canada. Authorities have not publicly named him as a suspect, but a series of restraining orders and a divorce filing last month hint at the couple’s troubled past. Family members have told local media he often beat and put voodoo curses on her. Stopped at the border: Jean-Michel Beaulieu (left) was detained trying to cross . the Vermont border into Canada after his wife Florence Beaulieu (right) was found . dead . ‘Anytime Florence tried to communicate with us, he beat her up,’ grieving mother Sylia Saint Louis, 57, told the Brockton Enterprise. ‘He tried to kill Florence all the time, with voodoo.’ Saint Louis told the Boston Globe that Jean-Michel Beaulieu beat her and ‘treated her like an animal.’ He faces three counts of violating a restraining order, the second taken out against him by Florence Beaulieu, but she declined to extend the latest order of protection when it expired May 14, relatives told the Globe. She was found dead by her children only two days later, bringing a violent end to their 15-year marriage. An official cause of death has not been announced. ‘On many occasions I had to call the police as a result of physical abuse ,’ the battered woman wrote in an application for the second restraining order taken out against Jean-Michel Beaulieu. House of horrors: The Brockton, Massachusetts home where Florence Beaulieu's children found her dead May 16 shown swarmed with police as they investigated her passing . ‘Every time he would beat me up, he bit, slapped and had spit on my face, as a result he has been arrested’ the battered woman wrote in an application for the second restraining order taken out against Jean-Michel Beaulieu. ‘On many occasions I had to call the police as a result of physical abuse. I have had to go to the hospital after he beat me,’ she continued. ‘I and the children are fearful for our lives and feel very threatened by him.’ She then decided against extending that restraining order after a minister advised her not to, Saint Louis recalled. The preacher said to reunite the family. Her parents pleaded with her to reconsider, but she insisted everything would be okay. ‘The cultural problem we have in our community is that people who aren’t trained to give advice in these situations are often the people who are turned to,’ the dead woman’s father, Emmanuel Saint Louis, told the Globe. ‘Here you have a young woman who was crying for help, but there were cultural barriers and knowledge barriers.’ The pair was granted custody of their four grandchildren last week, and Jean-Michel was arrested not long after. Authorities apprehended him at the Vermont border trying to cross into Quebec. On the scene: Investigators from both the Massachusetts State Police and Town of Brockton Police are shown investigating the death . ‘He was coming through the port of entry and was stopped,’ U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokesperson Stephen Sapp told WCVB. ‘We discovered that he was wanted for homicide in the city of Brockton.’ He has not yet been officially charged in the murder, but officials said he will be arraigned ‘at a later date.’ Florence Beaulieu’s parents told the Globe they are convinced her estranged husband is involved in her being killed. ‘I’m glad she is not suffering anymore,’ Emmanuel Saint Louis said. ‘He is going to pay the price for everything he did.’ Jean-Michel Beaulieu remains in custody awaiting his arraignment.","Mother of four Florence Beaulieu was found dead May 16 in her Brockton, Massachusetts apartment .

The parents of a promising law student who died of a heart attack after using a contraceptive allegedly linked to hundreds of deaths have vowed to sue its manufacturer at any cost after rejecting a $100million settlement. Erika Langhart, 24, was preparing to begin law school at Georgetown University, in Washington D. C., when she collapsed and died of a massive pulmonary embolism in 2011. When doctors rang her parents, back in Phoenix, Arizona, to inform them of the tragic news, the first thing they wanted to know was if she had been using NuvaRing - a hormonal contraceptive that is facing more than 4,000 lawsuits and may be linked to 224 deaths.

The new SiriusXM channel will feature live call-in shows hosted by Osteen and his wife, fellow Lakewood pastor Victoria Osteen, along with rebroadcasts of Osteen's past sermons. Lakewood Church pastor Joel Osteen pictured at Dodger Stadium during his A Night of Hope in Los Angeles in 2010 . 'It's another way to get our message out,' Osteen said. He said SiriusXM approached him about five years ago with the idea but the time wasn't right. 'Five years ago we were still growing,' said Osteen, who studied television and radio at Oral Roberts University. 'I didn't think we could put the time and energy into it that we can now. We're much more established and have a bigger library. It feels really right now.' He said he's considering Tuesday mornings as the best time for his call-in show. SiriusXM, which has 25.8 million subscribers worldwide, said Monday it will announce later when Osteen's new channel will begin operation. Saturday's broadcast of America's Night of Hope at Yankee Stadium won't be shown on television until later. Osteen will air his sermon at Yankee Stadium (pictured) in New York this Saturday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Manuel Joyner was arrested connection with a spate of so-called 'bottle bomb' incidents . A 20-year-old man has been arrested over a series of bottle bomb' pranks that led to the evacuation of several movie theaters in the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington. Manuel Joyner was arrested at his home in Bowie and charged in relation to a prank and evacuation at a movie theater in Largo, Maryland, on May 24, Prince George's County fire officials said. The theater was evacuated after someone used a device described as a 'bottle bomb,' in which an acid and a base are combined inside a sealed plastic bottle, causing it to explode. Later Sunday, Joyner was charged in three similar incidents at a movie theater in Tysons Corner, Virginia. The multiplex was evacuated on May 18 after two such devices burst, and police said acid and metal had been placed inside the bottles. Another evacuation occurred at the same theater a week later because of one of the devices. The chemical reaction caused by combining the chemicals rapidly releases gas, which bursts the sealed vessel. Authorities didn't say which chemicals were used in the Maryland and Virginia cases, but baking soda and vinegar are sometimes used to achieve the reaction. No one was injured in the Maryland and Virginia cases. Fire investigators have said similar devices could injure bystanders because of flying plastic when the bottle explodes or as a result of the acid inside. Manuel Joyner is charged with Manufacture/Possession/Detonation of a Destructive Device in connection with an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) that was detonated at the Magic Johnson Movie Theater on May 24 (pictured) Joyner was charged in Fairfax County, Virginia, with three counts each of creating, possessing or using an explosive; arson of an occupied public building; and use of weapons for a terrorist act, officials said. In the Maryland case, Joyner was charged with manufacture, possession and detonation with a destructive device, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, fire officials said. Another of the devices was set off at a theater in Alexandria, Virginia, in early April, though Joyner hasn't been charged in that case. Later Sunday, Joyner was charged in three similar incidents at a movie theater in Tysons Corner, Virginia (pictured). The multiplex was evacuated on May 18 after two such devices burst, and police said acid and metal had been placed inside the bottles . A person who answered the phone at Joyner's home on Sunday said she was unaware of the arrest and did not say whether he had an attorney. Following his arrest, officials said, Joyner's home was searched by investigators from several jurisdictions, as well as the FBI and ATF. Online court records show Joyner pleaded guilty in late 2012 to malicious destruction of property and was given probation before judgment.

"By . Ashley Collman . The Catholic diocese of Trenton, New Jersey says it wasn't responsible for a teenage boy's molestation because the priest was 'off duty' at the time of the abuse. Victim Chris Naples claims Reverend Terence McAlinden, now 73, sexually assaulted him hundreds of times over the course of a decade, starting when he was just 13 years old. Now 42, Naples is suing the diocese in Mercer County since other church leaders knew about the abuse and did nothing. Abused: Chris Naples (left) , now 42, claims he was sexually assaulted hundreds of times by Revered Terence McAlinden (right) over more than 10 years. The assaults took place at church and even on trips out of New Jersey . Naples previously lost a suit against the diocese in Delaware, where some of the abuse allegedly took place. It was during that case that attorneys for the diocese used the controversial argument that they couldn't be held responsible for Rev McAlinden's actions, because abusing a child is not part of a priest's 'duties'. Young: Rev McAlinden - aka Father Mac - started abusing Naples at the age of 13. Naples' mother let her son spend time alone with Father Mac because she thought he was a good role model. Above, a school picture of a young Naples . 'How do we determine when a priest is and is not on duty?' one of the justices asked. 'Well, you can determine a priest is not on duty when he is molesting a child, for example,' the diocese lawyer responded. 'A priest abusing a child is absolutely contrary to the pursuit of his master's business, to the work of a diocese.' Naples told the New Jersey Star-Ledger that he was astounded by the church's argument. 'Any hope I had that the church was concerned about me as a victim or about the conduct of its priests was totally gone,' Naples said. 'They were washing their hands of it. I was shattered. I just couldn’t believe that was one of their arguments.' Naples first came forward about the decade-long abuse in 2007, when he had a breakdown and nearly committed suicide. Instead, he came forward to the diocese with the heart-breaking tale of how Rev McAlinden - aka 'Father Mac' - took advantage of him from a vulnerable age. Naples told the Star-Ledger that he first met Father Mac in the mid-1980s when the priest headed the youth group at St Theresa's Parish in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey. Father Mac promised to take Naples out for a ride on his boat during their first meeting at a weekend leadership retreat in 1985. His mother, a highly-religious single mom, agreed to let her young son accompany the priest - thinking Father Mac was a great role model. Naples said nothing happened on that first trip out on Father Mac's boat 'The Poor Box', but that the outing was soon followed by an overnight trip on the Fourth of July when the priest first molested him. He claims the priest went on to molest him hundreds of times for the next 10 years, at the youth group's headquarters, the church rectory, Father Mac's parents' house, and on trips to Delaware, Connecticut, New York, Atlantic City and the Virgin Islands. Coming clean: Father Mac and Naples ceased their sexual relationship in 1997, and remained on good terms for another 10 years. But keeping their 'secret' caused Naples to have a breakdown and he eventually told his wife and the diocese about the priest's wrongdoings . Perhaps most damning for the diocese is that other leaders in the church knew about the abuse and did nothing. Chris Naples . The abuse went on until 1997, when Naples was in his mid-20s, and the two continued to remain on good terms. Father Mac even introduced him to his current wife Patty, a school teacher. He presided over their wedding, baptized their two children and acted as godfather for one. Naples says it was Father Mac's psychological control over him that kept him quiet for another 10 years. 'He knew how to manipulate,' Naples said. 'He would say things like, ""If your mother found out about this special thing we have, she would die,""' Naples said. 'He called it our little secret. And I thought I was the only one.' Naples finally told the diocese about Father Mac in 2007, after his wife confronted him for his distant behavior. Aftermath: Father Mac lost his position after Naples' revelations. He wasn't expelled from the priesthood however, and still receives his pension. Pictured above opening his door for a New Jersey Star-Ledger reporter. He refused to comment . Keeping the secret led Naples to become withdrawn and he even contemplated killing himself. Mrs Naples says she couldn't believe it at first, when her husband revealed he had been abused by the close family friend. But when he broke down in tears in front of her, she knew it was true. The diocese of Trenton conducted their own investigation into Naples' claims and promptly suspended Rev McAlinden from the ministry. However, they did not remove him from the priesthood. Rev McAlinden is still technically a priest and receiving his pension which he supplements with work as a real estate agent. After coming out about the abuse, Naples also realized he wasn't the only one Father Mac abused. Patrick Newcombe said in a 2011 press conference that the diocese paid him to be quiet about the abuse with a settlement in 1992. Bob Markulis, who claims he was abused by Father Mac in the 1960s when he was working at his first assignment at Our Lady of Victories Church in Sayreville, received an undisclosed settlement two years ago, his attorney Gregory Gianforcaro said. However, Rev McAlinden continues to deny he ever abused children. In a December 2012 deposition, he admitted to having an 'intense' sexual relationship with Naples, but that it didn't start until the younger man was 18. Accountability: Naples now lives in New Gretna, New Jersey with his wife and two children He says he's suing the diocese not for the money, but to hold them accountable for not protecting children . He also admitted to sleeping nude with a 'number of' other teen boys in the youth group and that it was 'standard practice' to bathe naked with the young men in his parent's hot tub. Rev McAlinden remained unapologetic when Naples confronted him in a taped phone call. 'At no time did I feel like I was using your or taking advantage of you,' McAlinden says on the tape, obtained by the Star-Ledger. Naples won an individual judgement against McAlinden in Delaware for $3million. He hasn't received any of that sum yet and doesn't believe he ever will since the priest has no assets. He maintains it's not about the money though, but about exposing McAlinden's for 'the monster that he is.' Naples has now moved on to suing the diocese, which he believes could have done more to protect him and other vulnerable boys. 'They knew about McAlinden. They could have done something about it. And they did what every other diocese did. They kept it hush-hush and paid behind-the-scenes settlements,' Naples said.","Chris Naples claims he was sexually abused hundreds of times by Rev Terence McAlinden over the course of a decade starting when he was 13 .
Now 42, Naples is suing the diocese of Trenton, New Jersey for knowing about McAlinden's abuse and doing nothing .
However, the diocese argued they weren't responsible for his behavior since McAlinden was 'off duty' as a priest when the sex crimes happened .
McAlinden was suspended from his position in 2007, when Naples first came forward about the molestation .
Two other men have admitted to being abused by McAlinden, and took undisclosed settlements from the diocese .
McAlinden was never officially removed from the priesthood, so he's technically still a priest and receives his retirement pension ."

With her toned body on show, the account of Sydney's Amanda Bisk is littered with photos of her doing yoga poses - only rivalled by contortionists - in precarious places or in front of striking back drops. Hard work goes into keeping a body like Bisk's in such good shape, but the former athlete has had to work harder than most to hold onto her fitness. Scroll down for video . Former pole vaulter Amanda Bisk has attracted almost 100,000 followers on her Instagram account with photos showing off her flexibility . Bisk's journey to recovery from chronic fatigue is documented on social media app, Instagram . Just three years ago - at the peak of her career - Bisk was diagnosed with chronic fatigue which meant she could never fulfill her dream of competing at the Olympics. At the time she had just returned from representing Australia at the Delhi Commonwealth Games and was working towards the London Olympics. Instead Bisk had to walk away to focus on recovering. 'I was turning to Instagram to look up a bit of yoga because I was getting into it a lot more and it was the only thing I could do,' she told the Wentworth Courier. 'It was really a hub of sharing information, learning a little bit and getting inspiration as well.' Bisk was signed up to the popular photo sharing app two years ago by her friends and as her abilities improved her photos got more interesting, growing her popularity. She was diagnosed in 2011 and took up yoga to help her recover and stay fit. Instagram was a way to find out more about her interest in the exercise program . Most of her photos are of her doing yoga poses on at Bondi Beach and surrounding areas . At first she was nervous about putting photos of her working out on Instagram, but her boyfriend encouraged her to share her experience. Bisk now has more than 98,000 followers who have photos of her holding poses on Bondi Beach and nearby areas popping up on their feed. Her photos - and their focus on health and fitness - have attracted the attention of fitness-wear label Sport Le Moda. She was named its new ambassador. Bisk represented Australia at the Delhi Commonwealth Games and was working towards the London Olympics when she had to quit . Bisk has since made the move to Sydney from Perth due to the popularity of her account. She said her followers were an inspiration to her . Bisk is also the founder of an online global community with a focus on health, well-being and fitness called Bodysquad. With her popularity growing on the social media app, the exercise physiologist made the move to Paddington, in Sydney's inner city, from the Western Australian capital of Perth three months ago. Bisk said her 'little fit fam' - what she refers to her followers as - were just as inspiring to her as she was to them, and had given her some life-changing opportunities. She said they inspired her to keep on going. To create a healthier lifestyle, Bisk said persistence was key. 'Whenever you do start something new it doesn’t work straight away. Start with small steps,' she said. 'Even if you do go downhill and go off track, every single positive effort is going to build up.' On Instagram, Bisk refers to her followers as her 'little fitness fam' and posts every day to help empower them .","The striking photos showing off Amanda Bisk's incredible flexibility has attracted almost 100,000 followers .

"By . Deni Kirkova . They may look good enough to eat, but these images of realistic-looking meals are actually made entirely of lambswool. From the Great British fry-up to a traditional roast dinner, art director and model maker Jessica Dance has recreated beloved classic dishes to scale - in a format not safe for human consumption. Each tiny baked bean is individually sewn and yarn colour is alternated to show grill marks on meats, making the brightly-coloured reproduction dinners hyper-realistic, and also cartoon-like; what a perfect diner advertisement might resemble. The Comfort Food series is a knitted project by Jessica Dance with photographer David Sykes - the burger came first . The project is a collaboration between ex-fashion student Dance, 26, from east London, and photographer David Sykes, 38, from London. Aptly called Comfort Food, the series aims to encapsulate the mood of the classic British café, fast food joint and burger van - but with a woolly twist. The burger meal - 'fast food reimagined' - . was knitted first. It features individually knitted fries in a red chip box, a mounded burger bun encasing a beef burger, and meticulous . detailing such as tomatoes, gherkins and floppy processed cheese. Once the burger had been shot, David and Jessica decided on the other dishes. They wanted to pick iconic dishes and thought, 'What's more iconic than a full English breakfast?', and recreated a classic fry-up form wool. For this one, Jessica had to make lots . of baked beans out of wool to scale - 'They took a while to make,' she . says, 'but were well worth it as they worked really well'. It features a cup of tea, toast, beans, tomato, egg, sausage, bacon with fat, mushroom and butter - all knitted to scale from representative multicoloured yarn. The British fry-up features a cup of tea, toast, beans, tomato, egg, sausage, bacon, mushroom and butter - all knitted to scale . The next . shot was the classic American hotdog. The pair muse that while it was the simplest dish to . produce, it created one of the most graphic and striking images of the series. The . hot dog features a white and beige knitted hot dog bun - just like a . real one - and a pinkish hot dog with a yellow wiggly strip of mustard running down its length. While shooting the first shots in this series, David mentioned that he wanted to send out a Christmas card and it would be great to make a Christmas dinner. So Jessica went away and created a full roast dinner out of wool. The roast came with all the trimmings, complete with woolly pigs in blankets - a must have at any Christmas roast - Brussels sprouts, carrots, cranberries, roast potatoes, gravy, and an entire turkey. The hot dog features a white and beige knitted hot dog bun - just like a real one - a pinkish hot dog and yellow wiggly strip of mustard .

David wanted the images to look like they were classic food photography, but on closer inspection turned out to be made of wool, so they styled the sets to be as real as possible. To help with the double take effect, David lit them in the same way he would light one of his shoots with real food. David and Jessica are planning to have an exhibition in London later in the year showing all their woolly projects, complete with large scale photographic prints of the work and also the actual models Jessica made for the shoots.

"The Qatar 2022 World Cup bid committee has denied all allegations of wrong-doing after allegations of widespread corruption during the bidding process. The Sunday Times claims it has received 'hundreds of millions' of documents which allegedly reveal disgraced former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam made payments to football officials in return for votes for Qatar. In a statement issued on Sunday, the bid committee said Bin Hammam had no association with them while denying any suggestion of wrong-doing. The committee said it was co-operating with the ongoing investigation led by FIFA's chief investigator Michael Garcia. 'The Qatar 2022 Bid Committee always upheld the highest standard of ethics and integrity in its successful bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup,' the statement said. 'In regard to the latest allegations from The Sunday Times, we say again that Mohamed Bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in Qatar's 2022 Bid Committee. As was the case with every other member of FIFA's Executive Committee, our bid team had to convince Mr. Bin Hammam of the merits of our bid..' No association: The Qatar 2022 World Cup committee bid denies that Mohamed Bin Hamman was associated with the bid process for hosting the World Cup . Hosts: Qatar held off competition from Australia to win the rights to host the 2022 World Cup . 'We are cooperating fully with Mr. Garcia's on-going investigation and remain totally confident that any objective enquiry will conclude we won the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup fairly. 'Following today's newspaper articles, we vehemently deny all allegations of wrong-doing. We will take whatever steps are necessary to defend the integrity of Qatar's bid and our lawyers are looking in to this matter. The right to host the tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the Middle East to host its first FIFA World Cup.' Earlier FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce would be in favour of re-running the vote for the 2022 World Cup if allegations that widespread corruption was involved in the Qatar bid were proven. Boyce, who was not on the executive committee on the world governing body at the time of the vote, said FIFA's chief investigator Michael Garcia, who is already looking into allegations of corruption, would have to widen his investigation. Support: FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce (left) says he would be in favour of a re-vote should the corruption allegations be proven . Boyce told Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme: 'As a member currently of the FIFA executive committee, we feel that any evidence whatsoever that people involved were bribed to do a certain vote, all that evidence should go to Michael Garcia, whom FIFA have given full authority to, and let's await the report that comes back from Garcia. 'If Garcia's report comes up and his recommendations are that wrongdoing happened for that vote for the 2022 World Cup, I certainly as a member of the executive co would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation was for a re-vote. 'If Garcia comes up with concrete evidence and concrete evidence is given to the executive committee and to FIFA then it has to be looked at very seriously at that time, there's no doubt about that.' Vice-president: Boyce took up his current role with FIFA in 2011 . Boyce, who said he had not had the chance to read the Sunday Times report, feels Garcia's investigation should not be hurried. He said: 'The man has got to be given full control to do that investigation thoroughly and if it takes more time to do that investigation thoroughly so be it. 'I have not met Garcia, but I'm told he's a man of the very, very highest calibre and I'm told he's someone who will not shirk the responsibilities that he has been given. I certainly hope that's going to be the situation.' Boyce pointed out that 50 percent of the executive committee members at the time of the 2022 vote had since left the governing body. The Northern Irishman also insisted FIFA president Sepp Blatter's position should not be called into question by the allegations. Trust: Boyce gave his support to FIFA president Sepp Blatter (left) and said his position shouldn't be questioned . Support: Gary Lineker shows his support a re-vote and for Australia's World Cup bid . He said: 'From the day that I became a member of the executive committee and from the day that Sepp Blatter announced that he wanted to see complete and utter reforms carried out by FIFA, he has led these investigations and he has led a lot of the reforms that were badly needed at FIFA that are now being carried out. 'There is no suggestion whatsoever that he was involved in any wrongdoing. ""When Garcia's report comes back to him, as president of FIFA he has to give leadership. 'There are people in authority who are not aware of things that go on regarding other individuals and if he personally wasn't involved in this I don't think there's any reason whatsoever for him to resign. 'He is still the president of FIFA and I'm sure he, like the rest of the decent people and the people who are involved in FIFA, are awaiting with great interest Mr Garcia's report.' Former England footballer Gary Lineker tweeted this morning that he believed that FIFA should hold another vote. Claims: The Sunday Times claims to have documents that prove Mohamed bin Hammam made payments to officials to get support for Qatar's successful World Cup bid . Rivals: Bin Hammam (right) tried to run against Sepp Blatter (left) for FIFA president but withdrew following allegations of bribery . Under a front-page headline of 'Plot to buy the World Cup,' The Sunday Times alleges . that Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari who used to be a FIFA vice president, . was lobbying on his country's behalf ahead of the vote in December . 2010. The newspaper alleges that Bin Hammam made dozens of payments to top football officials in Africa as well as Jack Warner and Reynald Temarii, former FIFA executive committee members for CONCACAF and Oceania. The allegations come less than two weeks before the start of the World Cup in Brazil and bring fresh scrutiny on the 2010 vote, which awarded football's biggest tournament to the tiny desert state and currently is under investigation by FIFA's independent ethics prosecutor. The Sunday Times said that Bin Hamman declined to respond to the allegations and that members of Qatar's bid committee denied any link to the former FIFA official, saying he played no secret role in their campaign. Bribes: Former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner (left) and Bin Hamman (right) faced allegations of bribery surrounding the 2011 FIFA presidential elections . FIFA: Bin Hammam (left) and Blatter (right) at Doha airport in 2010 . Pressure: FIFA has come under scrutiny since awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar . Qatari organizers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bin . Hammam, one of the most controversial figures in FIFA's recent history, . is no longer a committee member of world football's governing body . after being caught up in a corruption scandal surrounding his failed . campaign for its presidency in 2011. The Sunday Times is alleging, however, that he exploited his position at the heart of FIFA when he was an executive committee member to help to secure votes from key members of its 24-man ruling committee that helped Qatar win the right to host the World Cup. Qatar defeated bids from the United States, Japan, South Korea and Australia. According to the newspaper, Bin Hammam used 10 slush funds controlled by his private company and cash handouts to make dozens of payments of up to $200,000 into accounts controlled by the presidents of 30 African football associations who influenced how the continent's four executive members would vote. He also allegedly hosted lavish junkets for these African officials at which he handed out almost $400,000 in cash. Sepp Blatter at the Messe Conference Centre in Zurich where he announced Qatar would host the World Cup . World Cup? There have been suggestions that a re-vote will be required after these new allegations . The newspaper says the documents show that Bin Hammam paid out at least 305,000 euros ($415,000) in legal and private detective fees for Temarii after he was suspended for telling undercover reporters that he had been offered $12 million for his vote. Bin Hammam's help allowed him to appeal the suspension and prevent his planned replacement from voting for Australia in the vote, the Sunday Times claimed. Bin Hammam is also accused of funneling more than $1.6 million directly into bank accounts controlled by Warner, including $450,000 before the vote. Warner resigned from football duties, including his 28-year membership of FIFA's committee, in June 2011 to avoid investigation in a bribery scandal linked to Bin Hammam's campaign for FIFA president. The Sunday Times also said Bin Hammam paid $800,000 to the Ivory Coast FA, whose executive committee member Jacques Anouma agreed to ""push very hard the bid of Qatar,"" and signed off on two payments of $400,000 each to the federations of two other voters.

"By . Wills Robinson . The family of a rally fan who was killed when a car ploughed into a group of spectators on Saturday have said he died 'watching the sport he loved'. Len . Stern, who was hit by the vehicle as he watched the Jim Clark Rally in the Scottish Borders, has been described as a 'special uncle' who was 'well-loved by his family'. The 71-year-old from Bearsden, Glasgow, and Iain Proven, 64, who was also killed, have been pictured for the first time today. The third victim was Elizabeth Allan, 63, who was standing by the side of the road when a high-performance Citroen DS3 went over a humpback bridge before hitting the spectators. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Len Stern, 71, (left) and Iain Provan, 64, (right) were killed in the second of two crashes during the Jim Clark Rally in the Scottish Borders on Saturday afternoon . The accident car driven by David Carney from Co Mayo in Ireland (circled) approaches the humpbacked bridge . The car jumps over the bridge with all of its four wheels in the air . Tragically, the car loses control and careers into the ditch, killing three spectators . IIn a statement, Mr Stern's family said he was a 'a special uncle who was well-loved by the family.' They added: 'His death is really tragic but he died watching the sport that he loved. Our thoughts are with the driver and his family during this difficult time.' Mr Provan, a retired businessman, had . survived a serious car accident some years ago. Although also battling . leukaemia, he continued to attend motorsports events. His . family thanked the 'kind thoughts' that have been passed on and praised . the emergency services for their efforts in the aftermath of the tragic . incident. A picture posted on social media shows the 64-year-old with a camera taking notes on the first day of the three-day rally. Photographer . Stephen Tait wrote on Facebook: 'I met Iain at last year's Jim Clark, . lovely man, and this year I have had the pleasure of covering some . events for him. 'Will . miss chatting with him and working for him. My condolences go out to . his family and friends and also the others, Elizabeth and Len, who were . involved in this."" Chris . Collie also posted: 'A very nice man that I met and spoke to only a few . times but his passion for rallying was in no doubt. Always looking to . speak with me and find out my rally plans.' Two other injured men, both 61, are still in hospital - one in a stable condition and one in a critical but stable condition in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Eyewitness . Colin Gracey, a 46-year-old teacher from nearby Swinton, said: ‘It was . very traumatic. It was like a bowling ball hitting skittles. It was . awful, absolutely awful.’ Safety . concerns have been raised, as the fatal crash took place only two hours . after five people were injured, another 61-year-old man critically, by a . car at the same event. The . race was temporarily suspended after the earlier crash at Eccles, . despite fears about spectators, including children, standing in . dangerous positions close to the speeding cars. Police officers examined the scene of the accident to try and determine the cause of the crash . Race fans left tributes at the scene of the crash in Swinton in the Scottish Borders . Organisers . of the 197-mile rally, which was cancelled after the fatal accident, . insisted the safety of spectators was ‘paramount’ but that the sport is . ‘high risk’. It later emerged one driver considered pulling out of the . race after claiming spectators were ‘all over the road taking photos’. Rally . marshal Ann Reay said: ‘It is the worst outcome you could ask for. It . is a closed road rally. The public do get too close to the road. It’s . not the marshals’ fault, it’s not the organisers’ fault, it is people . getting too close and wanting to see more.’ Photographer . Craig McAllister, 28, who was covering the rally, said: ‘The marshals . were telling everyone to move back as the spectators were too close to . the road – but no one seemed to listen. I protested as there were young . kids there. 'Myself and the other photographers were really worried, as . there clearly was a massive safety issue. ‘I . had a horrible feeling that something bad was going to happen. How . close do they need to be? I saw young children sitting inches from the . road and saw a spectator move a barrier to get closer.’ Competitor . Euan Thorburn, who was spectating when the crash happened, said: ‘When . the safety car came round to check the track was safe and the position . of spectators, they stood back – but then they moved too close again, . about two feet away from the track. ‘I . told them to move because they were too close to the track and I told . the marshals to tell them. The marshals did, but they refused to move.’ On . a motoring forum, a person who did not want to be named said: ‘A friend . was running a car on this and was telling me that their driver was . threatening to pull out as the spectators were all over the road. Some . were standing in the road to take photos and jumping out of the way at . the last second.’ Rally . media manager Alan Johnstone said keeping spectators away from the cars . when the course is long and on public roads is ‘very difficult’. He . added: ‘Motor sport by its very nature has risks involved. As . organisers, safety is paramount. We try our best to get it as safe as . possible. But you’ll never get it 100 per cent safe.’ Superintendent . Phil O’Kane of Police Scotland said he thought organisers ‘would have . considered it was safe to move on to the next rally stage’ after the . first accident. He added: ‘Although safety barriers are put in place, . there are not stewarding positions along the whole route. It’s a . high-energy and a high-adrenaline sport and people want to take the best . positions.’ Borders . councillor Michael Cook said: ‘The rally has been going without incident . for over 40 years now and to have this happen has really rocked the . community. Everybody is very much feeling it and coming to terms with . what has happened.’ Police . Scotland is investigating the cause of the crash, but the dramatic . sequence of photographs shows the Citroen DS3 approaching the humpback . bridge close behind another car. It was said to be travelling at more . than 60mph. Onlookers can be seen swarming into the road after the car . lost control and veered into spectators on the far side of the bridge. The . Citroen was being driven by Irishman David Carney, from Westport in Co . Mayo. He was not hurt, but said to be ‘distraught’. Co-driver Ray . Fitzpatrick of  Cahir, Co Tipperary was also uninjured. Mr Provan, Miss Allan and Mr Stern were pronounced dead at the scene. Mr . Provan ran a firm called Motorsport Scotland. Neighbours said the crash . which Mr Provan previously survived had left his wife needing . round-the-clock care. Celebrities and leading motorsports figures used Twitter to pay tribute. Author Ian Rankin tweeted: ‘I’m hearing three spectators dead following crash at Jim Clark Rally. Grim news…’ F1 . driver Jenson Button posted: ‘Terribly sad news from the Jim Clark .

"By . Associated Press . After going for a walk, a German shepherd puppy decided to go for a drive — straight into a pond. John Costello, from Massachusetts said that his 12-week-old puppy, Rosie, was so excited Sunday after going for a walk at Bolivar Pond in Canton that she jumped in his running car, hit the gear stick and shifted into drive. The pooch then fell onto the gas pedal and sending the car careening into the water. Scroll down for video... Puppy power! A three-month-old German shepherd puppy is being blamed for driving a family car into a Massachusetts pond . What did I do? Could you really shout at a puppy with a face like this? In the blink of an eye: Rosie's owner, John Costello says it all started after he'd taken his frisky puppy for a walk by Bolivar Pond in Canton. He hopped into his car, and started it up, but Rosie had her own ideas and knocked the car into drive . 'The dog just jumped into the car and . hit the gear shift ... when she slammed it into drive she fell on top of . the gas pedal,' Costello told local television station WFXT-TV. 'The car went for a swim. We all did.' A couple of passers-by saw the commotion and helped Costello rescue Rosie. Nobody was injured, but Costello says the Dodge Neon is a total loss. That sinking feeling: Both the Canton police and fire departments arrived at the pond to help out, and remove the car from the water . Write-off: The car can just be seen poking through the surface of the water in this police photo . Taking it easy: Rosie is okay but unaware of all the commotion she caused . The 911 call surprised even police. Officer Robert Quirk says he has never heard of a dog driving into a pond. The car was totaled after being completely submerged in the pond, but the dog and owner escaped unharmed. 'The perp says she was just going with the flow of traffic,' Quirk said in a Twitter post showing a picture of the puppy. Eric Hermann, who was working nearby, rushed to help. Friends again: Mr Costello leaped into the car, grabbed the dog and pulled her out. They both fell back into the water . Ready for more: The entire encounter provided quite a bit of drama and excitement for everyone involved . 'It was about 30 feet out the car,' Mr Hermann said. 'The puppy was scared and ran to the back seat. The front door was open, [we were] trying to get her out the front door.' 'I just leaped in and grabbed the dog and pulled her out and we both fell back into the water,' said Mr Costello. The water level soon rose to be over Hermann's head. 'By the time we got the puppy out, the car had slid and we had to do a little swimming,' he said. But they all made it safely to shore in the end.","Rosie, the puppy, was excited and accidentally knocked the shift stick from park into drive .

"By . Becky Barrow . A radical pooled pension proposal could prevent retiring workers using their funds as they please. Experts say ‘collective defined contribution’ schemes will not qualify for the reforms introduced by George Osborne that allow pension holders to use their funds as a ‘cash machine’. They were described as ‘unfair and inflexible’ and it was said that they could lead to a poorer retirement for millions. Pension shock: Experts say 'collective defined contribution' schemes will not qualify for the reforms introduced by George Osborne that allow pension holders to use their funds as a 'cash machine' Legislation for CDC schemes is expected to be revealed in tomorrow’s Queen’s Speech. But Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, was among those warning that workers may not be able to benefit from the freedoms introduced in the Budget. From April next year, anyone aged 55 and over will be able to use their pension as a source of cash. Mr McPhail, whose claim was disputed by sources at the Department for Work and Pensions, said: ‘Any employer who decided to implement a CDC scheme would have to explain to employees why they can’t take part in the freedom everyone else enjoys.’ In a research note published yesterday, he said: ‘These pensions are unfair and inflexible and there is no demand for them.’ 'There are no guarantees': Ros Altmann warned that some CDC members in the Netherlands had no inflation increases for nearly ten years . Dr Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and former Downing Street adviser, agreed and added that pensioners may also lose the guaranteed increase in their pension currently offered. ‘Some CDC members in the Netherlands have had no inflation increases for nearly ten years and then had their pensions cut by about five per cent in the past couple of years,’ she said. ‘People need to understand that there are no guarantees on their pensions in these schemes.’ With a CDC pension, a worker and their boss pay money into a fund every month, but the money is kept in a single pool of assets, rather than an individual fund for each worker. It is these assets that are used to pay a retirement pension to workers. The size of their payout is determined by actuaries, who are mathematical experts working for insurers. Dr Altmann fears this could lead to older members getting a better deal than younger people. ‘There are risks that actuaries will not recognize the need to reduce benefits in time and continue to pay out more than is justified because they fail to foresee the future problems,’ she said. ‘In such cases, the older members will have had more than their fair share of the scheme assets, leaving younger members with less pensions than their own contributions would have generated.’ Lee Hollingworth, a partner at the consultancy Hymans Robertson, said: ‘Anything that provides cross-subsidy from one group to another is always likely to result in winners and losers. ‘With CDC, there is the risk that sustained periods of low returns could lead to the young subsidising current retirees. ‘Likewise, those less well-off could subsidise those better off, as they will draw on their benefits for much longer given the difference in life expectancy.’ Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, said: ‘We have already done much to make private and workplace pension schemes more attractive to workers. ‘But the UK can and must learn from other countries in taking this further and providing workers with a better deal. ‘A consultation on the specific issue of collective pensions is already under way and its findings will be published soon.’","CDC pensions described by analyst as 'unfair and inflexible'

"By . Tom Kelly . Rolf Harris was yesterday accused of ‘deliberately lying’ during his trial after being confronted with dramatic new TV evidence. He . is accused of molesting a teenager while filming a celebrity It’s a . Knockout-type show in Cambridge in 1975 – but claims he did not visit the university city until 'a couple of years ago, for an art exhibition of my paintings'. However, . jurors at Southwark Crown Court were yesterday shown footage of Harris . taking part in a Thames TV  show called Star Games filmed at Jesus Green in Cambridge in 1978. The jury were shown this photograph of Rolf Harris taking part in the ITV programme, Star Games filmed in 1978 in Cambridge . Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC put to Harris that the event was the one that the alleged victim had described. She said: ‘That video supports pretty much everything that (the alleged victim) said apart from the year, she has got the year wrong?’ He replied: ‘By three years, yes, she is out by three years.’ Miss Wass said: ‘But when you told the jury with such confidence last week on Tuesday that you had never been to Cambridge until four years ago, that was a deliberate lie, wasn't it?’ He replied: ‘No, it wasn't. I didn't find out that it was in Cambridge until I saw the video played back and then at the very opening the voiceover introduced it over what I remember was a helicopter shot of the field. ‘That was the first time I had heard the word Cambridge.’ The veteran told jurors: ‘I had no idea. I don't think any of us knew.’ Miss Wass asked: ‘Nobody knew they were in Cambridge?’ Harris replied: ‘None of the performers, none of the stars knew.’ He told the court the performers had probably gone in a bus or coach to the green and he would not necessarily have known where he was. Footage shown to the jury  in court yesterday showed Rolf Harris taking part in the celebrity show Star Games on ITV in 1978 . During . the opening credits of the Star Games final, a voiceover said the show . was coming from ‘Cambridge, a tranquil seat of learning.’ Harris . was announced by host Michael Aspel as captain of one of the celebrity . teams, which also included actors Colin Baker, Rula Lenska, Julian . Holloway and Robin Asquith. The Australian could be seen ‘jumping up and down like a kangaroo and mucking about amusingly’, Miss Wass said. She told Harris: ‘Michael Aspel seemed to know where he was because he introduced it as being on Jesus Green, Cambridge.’ Harris told Miss Wass she ‘didn’t understand the showbiz scene’, saying he was . often driven from place to place without knowing the location. The . alleged victim had suggested the event had taken place in the centre of . Cambridge in about 1975 when she would have been 14. Rolf Harris arrives at Southwark Crown Court where he is charged charged with multiple sexual offences dating to the 1960s . She . said she was working part-time to earn pocket money and was clearing up . when she saw  Harris entertaining crowds while pretending to be a dog. But she ‘froze’ as he got to his feet and allegedly ran his hands up and down her as he hugged her. Miss . Wass told Harris, who denies the assault: ‘The footage shows you . monkeying around pretending to be an animal – all of which fits the . description [the alleged victim] said she saw prior to being assaulted . by you. Miss Wass asked: ‘Are you saying that you entirely forgot that event?’ He said: ‘I did until I saw the video and then I remembered it all.’ Pressed further by the prosecutor, the entertainer said: ‘I'm doing hundreds of events during the year, going to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa. ‘This was 36 years ago you're talking about, 1978, not '75 as you stated earlier. 'I had forgotten that event until I saw that video’ He said he had not deliberately lied, but it was a ‘lapse of memory’. Putting it to Harris that he had suggested that the alleged victim lied, Miss Wass said: You . have said categorically in this case that all the people who say they . had been sexually assaulted by you have lied. 'I'm going to suggest that you are the one that has lied and that video demonstrates it, and that there is no way you could have forgotten that event and you deliberately tried to mislead the jury when you told them that you had not been to Cambridge until four years ago. That was a deliberate lie. ‘The film footage ... demonstrated it’s not the victims who have lied, it’s you who lied.’ Harris denies all the charges against him. The trial continues.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A porn addict who murdered his mother-in-law in a horrific sex attack that shocked an Old Bailey judge is facing life in jail. Mohammud Yusuf, 32, inflicted 'the most agonising death imaginable' on Amoe Stevens, 64, while his two young sons sat in the next room listening to their grandmother's cries. Yusuf - who had an obsession with violent pornography - carried out the sex attack on Mrs Stevens before leaving her to bleed to death at her home in Neasden, north west London. Mohammud Yusuf, 32, pictured left, murdered his mother-in-law Amoe Stevens, 64, right, after subjecting her to a brutal sex attack while his two sons sat in the next room at her home in Neasden, north west London . It was only when a carer found Mrs Stevens slumped in her chair that she was rushed to hospital, where she later died. Yusuf, also from Neasden, denied murdering Mrs Stevens but was was unanimously convicted of the charge after a trial at the Old Bailey. When the verdict was announced, Margaret Stevens, Yusuf's wife, wept so hard that she had to be comforted by the Old Bailey matron. The case also visibly shocked the judge, Nicholas Browne QC, who told the jury: ‘This lady suffered the most agonising death imaginable. ‘I have never come across such a factual background of a case like this.' During the trial, the court heard police were called by the carer found Mrs Stevens at around 8pm in October last year. Examination of Yusuf’s phone later revealed searches for pornographic videos showing violent rape, gang rape and incest. Prosecutor David Jeremy QC told the jury that there was a link between this interest and the injuries suffered by Mrs Stevens. Yusuf pleaded not guilty to murder, but was found guilty after a trial at the Old Bailey, London. He now faces life imprisonment when he is sentenced on Friday . He said: ‘Why this defendant or anyone would have inflicted injuries like these on their defenceless mother-in-law is not a question to which the prosecution can provide you with a complete or satisfactory answer. ‘But clues may be found in the contents of his phone and computers. ‘When you put alongside each other what must be a clearly deviant interest this defendant had in pain and degradation of women and what happened to Mrs Stevens, there is a relationship between them. ‘The effect of that is that it makes it more likely that it was this defendant who would have carried out that assault.’ Both Yusuf’s sons gave evidence to the jury. The court heard both are suffering emotional problems as a result of the case and one has resorted to self-harm. Mrs Stevens said in a victim impact statement that the case had devastated the family. Summarising the statement, Mr Jeremy said: ‘She describes her mother as a soft-spoken, hard-workingm loving person who was the peacemaker in any disputes. ‘She describes herself as being overwhelmed having lost her mother and her children having lost their father. ‘They are struck most of all by the complete lack of remorse that the defendant has show towards her mother, herself, her family and his two sons by defending himself. ‘He has made the experience even more agonising by refusing to face up to what he did.’ Yusuf will be sentenced on Friday. The judge warned he could face life imprisonment for the crime.","Mohammud Yusuf, 32, sexually assaulted his wife's mother Amoe Stevens, 64 .

"By . Richard Spillett . and Tom Kelly . The daughter of Rolf Harris broke down yesterday as she described confronting her father about his affair with a teenager, telling him: ‘How could you? It’s my best friend.’ Bindi Nicholls said she went into a ‘head rush’ after hearing about the entertainer’s long-running relationship with her inseparable childhood playmate. ‘It was just horrible, It felt like the whole world had changed in an instant,’ she told Southwark Crown Court in London. Rolf Harris's daughter Bindi (left) said her father, Rolf (centre, with wife Alwen Hughes) could not have assaulted her teenage friend in the 1970s . ‘I immediately went into “My dad’s a . b******, my friend’s a saint” type of thing. I rang him up and said, . “What on earth has happened here, you have had an affair with my friend, . how dare you, how could you, it’s my best friend”. ‘I was just so angry with him... He said, “Sorry, sorry love, I’m so sorry”.’ She . later became suicidal and began hitting her head against a wall and . wanted to stab herself, the court heard. Taking the stand, Miss . Nicholls, 50, also told the court of her home life with the entertainer, . saying he ‘didn’t take much notice’ of her. And she told the jury how she feared the stress of the trial might kill her parents, who are in their 80s. Harris . is accused of subjecting his daughter’s friend to a 16-year campaign of . abuse which started when she was 13 while on holiday with his family in . Hawaii in 1978. The 84-year-old star denies molesting her, but says . they had a consensual relationship after she turned 18. Rolf Harris's daughter Bindi Nicholls (left), told the court of her shock when she heard of her father's affair with the woman in later life, but said the alleged victim did not mention any underage abuse . Miss . Nicholls told how she had known the alleged victim ‘from the moment I . was born’. ‘She was my absolute bestest friend in the world,’ she said. ‘I loved her to bits, we were inseparable.’ They remained friends as . adults and met at the Harris family home in Bray, Berkshire, soon after . Miss Nicholls had her son, Marlon, in 1996. During the get-together, . Miss Nicholls confided in her friend that she suspected Harris of an . affair with his ‘spiritual healer’ and housekeeper, Andi Kingston. But . she said she was ‘shocked’ by the response from her friend, who said: . ‘The bitch, the old cow, she is so ugly, what on earth does he see in . her? How dare he? What a s*** he is. Your dad is a right b******.’ Miss . Nicholls said: ‘I felt like she was in love with my dad, which is just . weird. It was like a light went off in my head and I said, “Have you . been seeing my dad?” and “Has something happened between you and my . dad?”, and she said, “Yes”.’ She added: ‘She said, “It has been going on since I was 18 or 19, Bindi, it has been going on for ages”.’ In . tears, Miss Nicholls said her friend even described how Harris . discussed with her how he could improve his relationship with his . daughter. ‘She said, “He took me out for dinner and all he wanted to . talk about was you and your relationship. I wanted him to talk about . me”.’ Miss Nicholls told the court she was so angry with her father . that before she left the family home she took photos of herself off the . wall and put them face down. Count 1: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on girl aged 15 . Count 2: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 3: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 4: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 5: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 6: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 7: Indecent assault between 1/1/84 and 1/1/85 on same girl, then aged 19 . Count 8: Indecent assault on 31/5/86 on second girl, aged 14 . Count 9: Indecent assault on same girl, 14 . Count 10: Indecent assault on 31/5/86 on same girl, 14 . Count 11: Indecent assault between 1/1/68 and 1/1/70 on third girl, aged 7-8 . Count 12: Indecent assault on fourth girl, 14, between 1/1/75 and 1/1/76 . The television presenter denies all counts. Jurors heard she was ‘absolutely . devastated’ by the news and became depressed after returning to her home . in Devon. She told the court: ‘How would you feel if your dad and . your best friend were having an affair? I was suicidal. It was only . Marlon that kept me going.’ Miss Nicholls denied that her friend had . told her that Harris had abused her since she was 13. The friends last . met in 2004 but had an argument in which her friend hit her, Miss . Nicholls told the court.However, she said she had since worked things out with her father. ‘I . realised we are all human,’ she added. ‘I had him on a pedestal and now . I can see him as a father and a man.’ In cross-examination Sasha Wass . QC, said she had ‘colluded’ with Harris so that their evidence matched. She . replied: ‘This is not about me helping my father, this is about telling . the truth.’ She added: ‘I have been having counselling because it’s . really difficult being the daughter of a famous man and dealing with . that on your own is really difficult.’ Speaking of her childhood, Miss Nicholls said: ‘Dad didn’t really take much notice of me, or anyone for that matter, at home. ‘I . think when he is out in the world he wants to give everyone his time . and everyone is new and he can tell new jokes and new everything. ‘But when he is at home he is very much switched off, very quiet, quite often working, making something.’ Describing . the effect of the trial on her parents she said: ‘My parents are . 80-something, this is appalling for them. I have put my life on hold for . two years. I’m frightened they are going to die in the middle of this . court case. ‘Have you thought about how your parents might feel in . this sort of case?’ But Miss Wass shot back: ‘Have you given [the . alleged victim] any thought?’ Harris denies 12 counts of indecent . assault against four women aged between seven or eight and 19, over a . period of almost 20 years, between 1968 and 1986. The trial continues. Bindi Nicholls compared her famous father’s £11million fortune to ‘winning the lottery’, the court heard yesterday. She sent Harris an email in July 2012 asking what he wanted to do with his estate and ‘dreaming about the things you could do’, jurors were told. Miss Nicholls, who denied being ‘financially dependent’ on Harris but admitted he gives her a ‘monthly income’, said the letter was taken out of context. She said: ‘My dad is very vague about money and I would like to feel a bit more understanding about what he wants and what mum wants and what I can do for them in their old age.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Harris is accused of molesting 13-year-old friend of his daughter Bindi .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron is on course to easily win the Newark byelection on Thursday, according to a new poll. A survey by Conservative peer and pollster Lord Ashcroft puts the Tories on 42 per cent, 15 points ahead of second-placed Ukip on 27 per cent - with Labour trailing in third on 20 per cent. The results emerged as the Prime . Minister visited Newark for a fourth time in the campaign, telling . voters he understood 'temptations' to vote for other parties. But the Tories were hit by a separate national poll by Lord Ashcroft giving Labour a clear lead ahead of next years general election. Across the country, Ed Miliband's party is now on 34 per cent, up three points on last week, with the Tories down four points to 25 per cent. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats were down two points on just six per cent, with UKIP firmly entrenched in third place, up two points to 19 per cent. The Tories were installed as runaway favourites to hold on to the Newark seat on Thursday after polls showed the party had a comfortable 15 per cent lead ahead of the by-election . Despite the national slump for the Tories, Mr Cameron will point to a jump in support in Newark. The results show an upturn in support . for the Conservatives compared to last week's Survation poll for the Sun . which put the party on 36 per cent, with Ukip on 28 per cent and Labour . at 27 per cent. Lord Ashcroft said the differences shown by the two surveys could be down to his counting of 'shy voters' who refuse to say or claim not to know how they will vote in relation to how they voted in the last election, with more of these likely to be Tories. The Tory peer also released figures showing 70 per cent of voters planning to back Ukip's Roger Helmer in the by-election are doing so in a general protest to show they are unhappy with all the parties. The poll also showed a majority of Ukip supporters - more than six in 10 - said they were backing Nigel Farage's party to send a message that they were unhappy with their usual party. Ukip is hoping to capitalise on its success in the recent local and European elections and overturn the Conservative majority in the seat. David Cameron has thrown everything at the Newark by-election in a bid to avoid a humiliating defeat at the hands of UKIP. The PM appeared in the constituency today - speaking to workers at an electrical goods warehouse . Despite Labour trailing the Tories and UKIP in Newark the party has pulled ahead in the national polls, according to Lord Ashcroft . It became vacant when former Tory MP Patrick Mercer, who had served as an independent since May last year, resigned over a lobbying scandal in April. He stepped down amid allegations he asked questions in Parliament in return for money and did not contest the findings of a report into his conduct which suspended him from the Commons for six months. Nigel Farage ducked the chance to stand in Newark. He claimed this weekend that he would instead choose a seat in the South East of England . Mr Cameron, who was on the campaign trail alongside Foreign Secretary . William Hague, admitted Mr Mercer had 'let down' his constituents. 'He did let you down. What he did was completely wrong,' he said. 'Often in by-elections people think ""Well, you let me down, why should I?"" So I wanted to come here personally. 'There's . always temptations to go off and vote for another party, to send a . message about this or give the Government a kick about that and that's . absolutely people's right, we live in a democracy. 'You choose. You're my boss - you're his boss. If you think he'd do a good job, vote . for him; if you think I do a good job, vote for me at the next election. If you want to get rid of me at the next election, vote for someone . else.' Mr Cameron insisted Tory candidate Robert Jenrick was . committed to the Nottinghamshire constituency's long-term future unlike . the other parties' representatives, who the PM claimed view the poll as a . way to make gains in the run-up to the general election. He said: . 'Remember all those posters years ago - a dog is for life, not just for . Christmas - it is a bit the same with your member of Parliament. 'I . know Robert will be here, will be working hard because he is committed . to the long-term future of people in Newark and Nottingham. Mr Farage backed UKIP's candidate Roger Helmer to cause an upset in Thursday's crunch by-election . 'The other parties just see this as trying to make a bit of progress for something else they want to do elsewhere in the country. That is how Labour, how Ukip, how the others are addressing this by-election.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman were also in Newark to support their candidate Michael Payne. Newark is a Tory heartland so it is no surprise that the constituency's voters prefer David Cameron to Ed Miliband. But even the third of voters unhappy with Mr Cameron's performance would prefer him in Downing Street to the Labour leader . Labour supporters in the by-election seat want to see Ed Miliband in Number 10. But, worryingly for the Labour leader, almost one in five party supporters would prefer David Cameron as PM to Mr Miliband . The other eight candidates standing in Thursday's election are: David Watts for the Liberal Democrats; David Kirwan from the Green Party; two independents Paul Baggaley and Andy Hayes; Lee Woods from the Patriotic Socialist Party; David Bishop from the Bus Pass Elvis Party; Dick Rodgers from Stop Commercial Banks Owning Britain's Money and Nick The Flying Brick from The Official Monster Raving Loony Party. Following the poll, the Tories are now just 1/6 favourites to win the by-election following with bookies Ladbrokes. Matthew Shaddick of Ladbrokes said: 'UKIP's only hope looks like a last minute switch of Labour support. If enough voters are prepared to vote tactically to give David Cameron a bloody nose, this might still be a close contest.'","David Cameron has visited the constituency four times to halt UKIP rise .

"By . Emily Crane . and Leesa Smith . A man whose  scrotum has grown to the size of a watermelon may have it removed after a Melbourne plastic surgeon offered to perform the surgery for free. Tyrone Bowd from Willowbank, south west of Brisbane, was faced with having to raise $100,000 to have the life-saving surgery in America after being diagnosed with scrotal lymphedema a year ago. But surgeon Dr Ramin Shayan reached out to the 24-year-old's mother Tanya on Monday with the offer of free surgery after the family raised $10,000 in one week from public donations. Scroll down for video . Tryone Bowd, whose watermelon-sized scrotum caused him to have a motorbike accident at his Queensland home last year, will now have surgery to remove it . Mr Bowd's rare condition causes infections that result in soaring temperatures, increased heart rate and makes his body turn septic. His large scrotum also makes it a struggle to walk. Dr Ramin Shayan, who has a PhD in lymphoedema, said he would complete the surgery at St Vincent's and the O'Brien Institute in Melbourne . Dr Shayan, who has a PhD in lymphoedema, said he would complete the surgery at St Vincent's and the O'Brien Institute in Melbourne, pending a review of Mr Bowd's medical records. 'We were told no one in Australia could help us, so to find out there’s help is great,' Mrs Bowd told South-West News. Dr Shayan, who has operated on two patients with similar conditions, said Mr Bowd’s would continue to grow and eventually stop him from walking and wearing normal clothes. 'The life threatening part of this would be the infections he could get,' Dr Shayan said. 'Why should this poor guy try and struggle with his life, $100,000 is the cost of a house in some parts of the country.' Mrs Bowd said her son, who weighs 112kg and also has an inverted penis, had previously sought help from more than 100 medical professionals. She said the last 12 months had been emotional for her and her son, who is intellectually impaired. 'Some days I get to the point where I think we won’t get the help we need but as a mother I can’t stop. I’m 100 per cent committed to saving my son’s life,' Mrs Bowd said. Melbourne surgeon Dr Ramin Shayan reached out to the 24-year-old's mother Tanya on Monday with the offer of free surgery . Mrs Bowd told the South-West News last week that her son no longer had faith in doctors and was 'banging his head against a wall' in frustration that no one medical professional in Australia could help his heartbreaking situation. 'One response I got was they could give him a sex change but couldn’t repair his scrotum so I basically threw my hands in the air,' she said. 'A couple of doctors said they could build a team and give it a go and I said ""it's not a game of cricket mate, he's not a guinea pig"".' His family held a car drive in Ipswich on Saturday to raise funds for Tyrone to fly to California to undergo lifesaving surgery performed by Dr Joel Geldman - they raised $10,000. Mrs Bowd had been liaising with Dr Geldman who guaranteed he and his medical team could perform the operation. Tyrone was faced with having to raise $100,000 to have the life-saving surgery in America after being diagnosed with scrotal lymphedema a year ago . Wesley Warren famously had his scrotal lymphedema corrected by Dr Geldman after going public on shock jock Howard Stern's radio show to talk about the plight of his 45kg scrotum. Mr Warren died in March after suffering two heart attacks when he was hospitalised due to complications from diabetes. Dr Geldman told Mrs Bowd that he had performed the procedure 175 times. 'I've contacted Dr Geldman and I have had continuous correspondence with him,' she said. 'He has been monitoring Tyrone's condition via medical reports CT scans, ultrasounds and photographs.' Wesley Warren famously had his scrotal lymphedema corrected by US doctor Joel Geldman after going public to talk about the plight of his 45kg scrotum . Mrs Bowd said that maintaining a normal family life was difficult. 'Tyrone needs help to go to the toilet and he has a lot of difficulty walking,' she said. 'He broke his leg in a motorbike accident earlier this year and that’s because his scrotum was a hindrance on the bike.' 'His scrotum is so big that he can’t ride a bike anymore and family and friends pitched in to get him a quad bike.' Ms Bowd said Tyrone had a heart of gold and rarely complained about the pain. 'He is always trying to make everyone he meets laugh, he loves fast cars, motor bikes, playing jokes, listening to music and spending time with people,' she said. Mrs Bowd said her son, who weighs 112kg and also has an inverted penis, had previously sought help from more than 100 medical professionals .","Tyrone Bowd, 24, struggles to walk as he suffers from scrotal lymphedema .

"By . Lucy Crossley . ITV's new breakfast show Good Morning Britain fronted by Susanna Reid could face the chop after just one month on air following a ratings slump. Since it launched to a grand fanfare at the end of April, ratings have plummeted as viewers continue to tune in to Reid's former show BBC Breakfast. For the past fortnight the programme has failed to reach the 15 per cent of the audience share bosses reportedly said it needed to survive, and the show is being watched by fewer people than flop Daybreak - which it was brought in to replace. Scroll down for video . Facing the chop? Susanna Reid's ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain, which she presents along with Sean Fletcher, Ben Shephard and Charlotte Hawkins, could be axed following a ratings slump . Falling ratings: Although around 80,000 people tuned in for the launch show, numbers have slipped since . Reid was Good Morning Britain's big signing to launch the new show after being lured from the BBC, where she had proved to be a popular figure. During Good Morning Britain's launch . week, the ITV show had an average of about 690,000 viewers, while BBC . Breakfast maintained a steady 1.5million. However, last Monday just 270,000 viewers watched the show, according to The Sun, and despite it being a Bank Holiday, 1.17 million people still tuned into the BBC rival - which had a 34.7 percent of the audience share, compared with Good Morning Britain's 9.5 percent. A senior source at ITV admitted that the programme would be unable to continue, unless viewers returned. Replacement: Good Morning Britain's high profile launch came after its predecessor Daybreak, presented in its final months by Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones, was dropped for low audience figures . Rival: Susanna Reid left BBC Breakfast, here presented by Charlie Stayt and Louise Minchin, earlier this year. The BBC show regularly pulls in average viewing figures of more than one million . 'No-one is expecting to beat the BBC and no-one is expecting to get over a million viewers,' the source told The Sun's Colin Robertson. 'But we do want it to get above 15 percent - or it is toast.' Good Morning Britain's high profile launch came after its predecessor Daybreak was dropped for low audience figures. Between its debut to May 28 Good Morning Britain attracted an average audience of 584,200, 15.2 percent of the audience share, compared with Daybreak's average of 673,800, or 16.6 percent, during the same period last year. In the months before it was axed Daybreak was attracting an average of around 600,000 viewers. Launch: During Good Morning Britain's launch week, the ITV show had an average of about 690,000 viewers, while BBC Breakfast maintained a steady 1.5million . The source suggested that Good Morning Britain, introduced by ITV's director of television Peter Fincham, could continue for the next six months to avoid embarrassment for bosses at the channel. However, following Daybreak the broadcaster could be tempted to do away with a breakfast show completely, and return to showing children's programmes every morning. An ITV spokesman told MailOnline that there are 'absolutely no plans to axe Good Morning Britain', and programme makers are in for 'the long game'. Good Morning Britain (28 April – 28 May 2014) Average number of viewers: 584,200 . Audience share: 15.2 percent . Daybreak (28 April – 28 May 2013) Average number of viewers: 673,800 . Audience share: 16.6 percent . BBC Breakfast (28 April – 28 May 2014) Average number of viewers: 1.49million . Audience share: 36.78 percent . BBC Breakfast (28 April – 28 May 2013) Average number of viewers: 1.49m . Audience share: 34.75 percent . Reid, whose profile increased hugely late last year in the wake of her appearances on last year’s Strictly Come Dancing, is joined on the weekday show by Ben Shephard - a familiar face for ITV breakfast viewers from his GMTV days, as well as Charlotte Hawkins and Sean Fletcher - who were both poached from Sky. The four presenters appear on screen at the same time. For viewers, one of the biggest changes to predecessor Daybreak - along with the presenting team - was the introduction of a glass desk at which the hosts were seated for much of the show, although they moved to sofas later. Many observers have interpreted the discussions around the desk as more of a US-style approach, taking its cue from ABC’s popular Good Morning America. But viewers were divided on the show, with some lamenting the passing of its predecessor while others praised its fast pace and gloss. Ms Reid’s ITV debut initially drew mixed reactions, with criticism that the show looked too similar to its U.S counterpart and that Ms Reid’s figure were obscured by a desk. As the show began viewers took to Twitter to complain that the legs of the 43-year-old - whose pay for the role has been reported as £400,000 and as much as £1million a year - were hidden from view. One viewer commented: 'Why has ITV paid so much for @susannareid100 only to put her behind a desk? Its like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage #gmb.' Another wrote: 'You don't hire Susanna Reid and then stick her behind a desk #getyourpinsout #GoodMorningBritain.'","For the past fortnight the show has failed to reach audience share of 15% .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A man has been warned he could face jail after a stone mantelpiece which weighed the same as a fridge freezer collapsed and killed a six-year-old girl. The mantelpiece, which was being installed at a family home in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, collapsed on top of Isabella Pritchard - known as Bella – in July 2012. The youngster, who had three brothers – Will, Oli and Archie - died from severe head injuries after the heavy stone fireplace crashed on top of her while she was playing. Isabella Pritchard, six, (left) died from severe head injuries after the . stone mantelpiece collapsed on top of her while she was playing at her . family's home in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Christopher Elmer, 39, . (right) admitted a Health and Safety breach while fitting the fireplace . when he appeared at Reading Crown Court . Now, Christopher Elmer has been warned he could receive a prison sentence after he admitted a Health and Safety breach in relation to the schoolgirl’s death. The 39-year-old had been due to stand trial for manslaughter by gross negligence at Reading Crown Court today but the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence. Court: Christopher Elmer, 39, admitted a Health and Safety breach in relation to the schoolgirl's death when he appeared at Reading Crown Court . It came after Elmer admitted failing to ensure she was not exposed to health and safety risks while he worked at her parents’ five-bedroom home on July 7, 2012. Prosecutor Iain Wicks said: ‘Following a review of the expert evidence and new reports by the experts, the view was taken that the evidence was insufficient to establish that offence.’ Isabella, who attended the £10,000- a-term Maltman’s School for Girls in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, was playing at her home when the tragedy occurred. She was taken to Wexham Park Hospital in nearby Slough, Berkshire, where she later died as a result of her injuries. Her parents today attended what should have been the first day of Elmer’s trial and listened in the public gallery as his plea to the Health and Safety breach was accepted. Judge John Reddihough told Elmer that a pre-sentence report would be prepared prior to his sentencing but warned he could face jail. He said: ‘I must make it clear to you that all sentencing options remain open to the court, including a custodial sentence.’ Elmer, of Greenford, Middlesex, was released on unconditional bail and will be sentenced on a date yet to be fixed. Mr and Mrs Pritchard declined to comment after the hearing. At . the time of Isabella’s death, headmistress of Maltman’s School for . Girls, Joanna Pardon, described her as a ‘very special little girl with . an infectious love of life’. She said: ‘She will be remembered for her wonderful smile, her laughter and her caring gentle nature.'","Isabella Pritchard died from severe head injuries after fireplace fell on her .

"By . Damien Gayle . A robber has been jailed for life for battering to death a partially sighted 91-year-old whose home he was burgling. Scott Melville, 38, attacked Sydney Pavier at the pensioner's home in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, leaving him for dead with 'horrendous' head injuries. It was only after relatives later found the pensioner unconscious and covered in footprints from the battering that he was taken to hospital, where he died a month later. 'Intensely proud of his independence': Sydney Pavier, left, had refused the help of carers and still lived in his home of 83 years, where he was beaten to death by burglar Scott Melville, right, who was today jailed for life . Melville, of no fixed address, denied murder but was convicted by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court after a five-day trial. Judge James Burbidge QC sentenced him to life, with a a minimum term of 26 years. The court heard that Melville had smashed his way into Mr Pavier's home of 83 years in the early hours of September 16 and ransacked the property as he hunted for valuables. When he came across Mr Pavier, an Army veteran and former carpenter whose sight was failing, he began punching and kicking him until he was unconscious. Relatives calling in on Mr Pavier later that morning found the door smashed and the pensioner bloodied and unconscious on his bed. He was rushed to University Hospital, Coventry, where he lost his fight for life just over a month later, on October 28. Speaking after the sentence Detective Chief Inspector James Essex, of Warwickshire Police, said: 'This sentence reflects the violence inflicted by Melville, but it cannot in any way equate for taking the life of a frail old gentleman who had proudly maintained his independence at his home in Gordon Street, Leamington, despite his failing eyesight. 'Sydney had served in the Army and worked as a carpenter in Leamington until he retired some years ago. 'He was a man of modest means, with little of value in his home and although in later years he seldom went out, he kept himself up to date on what was happening in the world through his radio. 'Intensely proud of his independence, he had resolutely refused the help of carers, and had only reluctantly accepted some assistance from relatives when his failing eyesight meant he could no longer cook his meals properly. 'Why Melville chose to break into Sydney’s home, why he then attacked this defenceless, partially sighted frail old man, we cannot know. 'Sydney was found badly beaten, lying unconscious on his bed, when relatives called to see him on the morning of 16 September last year. 'The door had been kicked in and the house ransacked. 'Despite his horrendous injuries, Sydney battled to live, but more than a month later on the 28th October he sadly lost his fight for life.' Melville also previously pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery involving the theft of a mobile phone two days before the break in and the burglary at the Next Stop newsagents in Leamington Spa on the same day he attacked Mr Pavier. Judge Burbidge QC ordered that there would be no separate penalty for the robbery and burglary charges.","Sydney Pavier was battered and left for dead in bed in his home of 83 years .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A firefighter who was left paralysed for life by a motorbike crash battled 16 years of pain but ended up committing suicide after doctors told him there was ‘nothing wrong with him’. Derek Tonks, 43, was left with only the use of his right arm after he suffered a major spinal injury when he was crushed under a car in June 1998. He had been travelling to his second ever shift after spending 10 years trying to join West Midlands Fire Service when he was struck by a car in Willenhall, West Midlands. Accident: Derek Tonks, 43, was left with only the use of his right arm after he suffered a major spinal injury in a motorbike crash in June 1998 and lived with 16 years of pain . An inquest heard how, following the accident, Mr Tonks bravely battled his disability to live as independently as possible. He taught himself to drive again, went on holidays, enjoyed diving and lived on his own in a specially adapted flat. But the hearing was told Mr Tonks killed himself at his home on February 4 after ‘going downhill’ following a confrontation with doctors earlier this year. The inquest heard how he had gone to The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, in Oswestry, Shropshire, because he was having trouble swallowing. Mr Tonks told doctors he felt full after only a small amount of food and thought his spleen, which had been ruptured in the accident, had swollen to block his digestive system. Former firefighter Derek Tonks, pictured with his mother Patricia, committed suicide after living with his injuries for 16 years . Giving evidence his mother Patricia Tonks, who went to the hospital with her son, said: ‘He was told there was nothing wrong and was shouted at by a doctor. ‘After that his mood changed from trying to fight to get better to giving up. ‘It was downhill from there.’ She also said he felt uncomfortable and could not sleep at night, feeling his body to be twisted and deformed, but doctors said this was not supported by X-rays. She told the inquest at Walsall Manor Hospital how she begged her son not to give up and even offered to accompany him to the Dignitas Clinic in Switzerland, for assisted suicide. Mr Tonks, who was known as Andy, left notes for his parents, sister and a former girlfriend before taking a fatal dose of prescribed antidepressants. On Friday, the inquest heard he had told a friend he intended to commit suicide and coroner Robin Balmain concluded that he killed himself from an overdose. He said: ‘This was a young man who’d got lots going for him, who was clearly a very determined character. ‘This is in every way a tragedy.’ Mrs Tonks said her son had always refused to give up over the years, despite everything life threw at him. He spent weeks in intensive care after his spine was crushed as he rode to work at Handsworth Fire Station, in Birmingham, on June 5, 1998. It was his dream to follow in the footsteps of his father, also called Derek, who was a firefighter in nearby Dudley. Mrs Tonks said: ‘He got on a course in January 1998 and then in May 1998 the course ended. ‘He started work, did one shift and then, on the way to his next one, he had his accident. The inquest heard how Mr Tonks went to the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, in Oswestry, Shropshire, because he was having trouble swallowing . ‘All his dreams ended. Even after that he didn’t give up. ‘The last few years wore him down and it was so out of character. But he was such a strong, amazing person. ‘He was such a nice person. Everyone liked him. Now he’s gone, I just hope to God he’s happy. ‘We loved him. He was an amazing young man. As much as I miss him, I’m happy he is at peace.’","Derek Tonks was left paralysed for life after motorbike crash in June 1998 .

"By . Martin Robinson . A thousand frenzied twitchers have rushed to the south coast after a rare bird of prey was spotted on mainland Britain for the first time ever. Police were needed to control crowds as bird watchers flocked to Wareham Forest in Dorset after news broke that a short-toed eagle had been seen over the weekend. The young bird of prey, which has a 6ft wingspan, got lost on its first migration from Africa and ended up on the south coast of Britain rather than southern Europe. Enthusiasts have travelled from as far afield as Scotland to glimpse the endangered bird, which has only ever been seen twice before in the UK before - in Jersey in 1999 and the Scilly Isles in 2011. The eagle has lost its way by hundreds of miles on its journey from sub-Saharan Africa to southern Europe, with the majority of the species heading to southern France, Spain, Turkey, Greece and Russia. Rare bird in flight: This short-toed eagle has got lost on its way from Africa to southern Europe and ended up in Dorset by mistake, leading to great excitement among enthusiasts . Bird lovers: Hundreds of people descended on the area with telescopes and cameras hoping to catch a glimpse of the rare bird of prey . Paul Morton caught sight of the bird of prey while leading a guided walk through the 8,000-acre woodland. He put the news of the rare sighting on Twitter on Saturday afternoon and within a few hours hundreds of bird watchers turned up. By Sunday morning their numbers had more than doubled . Mr Morton, 31, from Upton near Poole, said: 'I was leading a guided walk in Wareham Forest when a member of our party spotted a bird of prey in a tree. 'At first I thought the bird was a pale-faced buzzard, which is very common in Dorset, but as I got closer I could see I was wrong. 'Suddenly it hit me that I was looking at a short-toed eagle. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing because spotting one is almost unheard of. 'I have studied birds all my life and but I wanted to make sure I had identified it correctly so I got in touch with some bird watcher friends and they all confirmed I was right. 'The eagle flew off 15 minutes after we spotted it but it returned to almost the exact same tree at four or five hours later. 'I returned on Sunday morning and there must have 500 bird watchers there. 'In bird-watching terms the sighting is huge - never before has a short-toed eagle been seen on mainland Britain.' Rare sighting: The birds are common in central and southern Europe during the British summer, especially in the south of France, but this young bird overshot the area by hundreds of miles . Short-toed eagles migrate from Africa in the spring and can live up to 30 year. The birds are common in central and southern Europe and have a wingspan of up to 6ft . Excitement: The crowd on top of Morden Bog on Saturday, whose numbers grew even more on Sunday as word spread online that the bird had unexpectedly arrived in Britain after flying off course . Short toed eagles - Circaetus gallicus in Latin - over-winter in sub-Saharan Africa and are most commonly found in central Europe, especially southern France, in the summer. They feed on lizards and snakes and hunt from a height of around 1,500 feet. Mr Morton, who runs the charity Birds of Poole Harbour, added: 'This eagle is only a one year old so this is its first migration. 'The thinking is that it has got a bit lost on the way up from Africa where it would have spent the winter. 'Instead of ending up in central Europe it has been blown across to Britain in the easterly winds we have had a lot of lately. 'There are plenty of lizards and snakes and in Wareham Forest so we might just find it sticks around for the summer if we are lucky.' Crowd control: Police were called in to deal with the huge numbers of bird watchers who descended on the small corner of Dorset over the weekend . Twitchers at dawn: After an expert spotted the rare short-toed eagle in Dorset and revealed it on Twitter hundreds of bird watchers travelled to Morden Bog, near Wareham, to catch a glimpse of the bird, seen on the British mainland for the first time ever . Martin Cade, of the RSPB based at Portland, Dorset, said it was highly unusual for big birds of prey to fly over large stretches of water like the English Channel. He said: 'Southern France is as near as they normally get to Britain. They don't like crossing the water and so hardly ever reach here. 'Big birds of prey struggle to get across large areas of water as they like to have lots of lift and thermals and warm air. 'But if one of going to come to Britain then Dorset is the ideal place as it is home to six species of reptiles, three lizards and three snakes.' The sighting will now be reported to the British Birds Rarities Committee. Short-toed eagles have a life expectancy of 30 years. They are generally very silent but can emit a variety of musical whistling notes. Their breeding population in Europe numbers about 8,000 pairs.","News of the short-toed eagle landing in Dorset led to hundreds of people flooding to nature reserve over the weekend .

A recent graduate has been killed after a car ploughed into her as she waited for a bus with a friend on a night out to celebrate finishing her degree. Rebecca McManus, 21, died after she was hit at by a Mitsubishi at a bus stop close to Birmingham city centre at 7.50pm on Saturday. Miss McManus was pronounced dead at the scene while her friend, also 21, was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where she remains in a critical condition. Miss McManus had recently moved back to Oldbury after completing her three-year English Literature with Creative Writing degree at the University of East Anglia in Norwich last month. Her family today paid tribute to her saying: 'Rebecca lived life to the full; she was bright and funny with a wonderful future to look forward to. We are totally devastated by her loss.' A 32-year-old man from Birmingham has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Sgt Paul Hughes, from West Midlands Police, said: 'This is a tragic incident which has left a young member of the local community dead and another critically ill in hospital. 'I have been overwhelmed by the number of witnesses that have come forward so far but continue to appeal for the public's help. 'I know the vehicle involved, a red Mitsubishi, travelled along the A4123 Wolverhampton  Road before turning onto Hagley Road West, and may have been travelling with another dark-coloured vehicle, possibly a BMW. 'If anyone saw these vehicles then I would ask them to contact me or my team. 'It's important for the investigation and the families that we piece together all the events and I can only do this with the public's help.' Tributes have been left at the scene of the crash. One said: 'Becky, one of the nicest people I've ever met. Rest in peace, love Luke and George.' Tributes: Flowers and cards have been left at the bus stop, which was destroyed when a Mitsubishi ploughed into Miss McManus and her friend, who is in a critical condition . Lynsey Grant, who stopped to help Rebecca shortly after the crash, left a card to her family, saying: 'We are so sorry for your pain. 'Please know that these young ladies were cared for with urgency and compassion by all at the scene. My heart and thoughts are with you.' Witness Furquan Shamshi has described how the car ploughed into the two women. He said: '[The driver] lost control, smashed into the bus stop and went into the girls waiting there. 'The noise was so loud and was just awful. The car ended up in the park about 100 yards down from the bus stop. 'The park was busy with people enjoying the weather, so I'm amazed more people weren't hurt. 'I ran over to help and saw two women lying on the ground. 'It was clear she had already gone. 'It looked like the girls were heading into town to enjoy a night out and that that happens. It's so tragic.'","Rebecca McManus hit by Mitsubishi at bus stop close to Birmingham city centre .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A cashpoint filler was forced to call 999 after getting trapped inside an ATM while loading it with money. Firefighters spent more than two hours trying to free the worker after he accidentally became trapped in a security room behind the device at a petrol station in Brentwood, Essex. Crews had to verify the identity of the trapped security guard before calling in a specialist search and rescue team to help with the incident at Shell Service Station on Saturday lunchtime. Stuck: Firefighters spent more than two hours trying to free the worker after he accidentally became trapped in a security room behind the device (far left) at this petrol station in Brentwood, Essex . The specially-trained officers used heavy-duty cutting equipment to dismantle the front of the outside cash machine and free the man, who was trapped for more than two hours. Essex County Fire and Rescue Service said the man, who worked for Greenteam Services Ltd, suffered no injuries in the rescue. Pream Kumar, manager of the petrol station, said he tried to help free the man after realising he had become stuck but his efforts were to no avail. He said: ‘I was inside the office and my staff said a man had got stuck in the machine. ‘I went outside and I could hear he was trying to open the door from the inside so I tried to pull it but it wouldn’t go. ‘He was talking to his colleague who had been waiting outside of the cash machine for him while he loaded it with cash. ‘He told me he opened the door and went in to change the money and then suddenly the door wouldn’t reopen open. ‘It’s a very busy garage because of the M25 and being on the outskirts of Brentwood so lots of people were coming in and asking why the cashpoint was closed and what was going on. I didn’t know what to tell them. ‘It’s the first time I’ve seen anything like this.’ Cut free: The specially-trained officers used heavy-duty cutting equipment to dismantle the front of the cash machine and free the man, who was trapped for more than two hours . Mr Kumar said the worker eventually called the fire service and firefighters were forced to dismantle part of the ATM to free him. He said: ‘They had to break the door. They’ve put a cover over it now so the cashpoint still isn’t working. There’s just a sign saying it’s out of order. ‘I don’t know when they’ll be back to fix it.’ A spokesman for Essex County Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘Firefighters were called to rescue a security guard who got trapped while loading up a cash point machine at a Shell petrol station. ‘The Securicor officer had gone into the security room behind the machine and got locked in. ‘After verifying his identity, firefighters set to work to free him. ‘ECFRS' Urban Search and Rescue team were brought in with specialist heavy duty cutting equipment to assist a crew from Brentwood. ‘Firefighters eventually gained entry and the guard was released by 2pm unharmed.’","Securicor worker became trapped in room behind ATM at petrol station .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A former GMTV reporter who fraudulently claimed tens of thousands of pounds in housing benefits has been ordered to repay more than £100,000 after a judge said he ‘found it difficult to trust a word she said’. Louise Port, 38, who worked on GMTV until 2006, broke down in tears as Southwark Crown Court heard how she swindled more than £70,000 in housing benefits while making money by renting out properties in London. The judge today ordered the ex-girlfriend of former Scotland football manager Craig Brown to repay the money with interest after hearing how she spent the cash to pay off her credit card debts. Louise Port, 38, (pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court), has been ordered to repay more than £100,000. The former GMTV reporter used to have long, blonde hair (right) but has shaved her head in recent months (left) Port, who also failed to declare to authorities that she owned a two bedroom flat in Isleworth, Middlesex, was found guilty at a previous hearing of wrongly claiming £76,157.14 in housing benefit between September 2006 and August 2011. She escaped prison because she suffers from epilepsy and was instead handed an 18-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to carry out 120 hours of community service after the judge ruled she had carried out ‘deliberate deception’. Former Scotland manager Craig Brown  was Louise Port's boyfriend . However, Port was today ordered to repay the £76,000 plus interest to City of Westminster Council, to which she also owes £10,000 in council tax. Port, who attended court with her . father Campbell, wept in the dock as the judge told her she must also . repay £15,000 - half the prosecution costs to bring the case to court. It means she must repay a total of £106,000. At the hearing at Southwark Crown Court, Judge . Anthony Pitts said: ‘I must confess I find it very difficult to trust a word she says in terms of honesty. ‘Of course she has had great difficulties in her life, but it is quite clear to me that she lied whenever it suited her to the jury with considerable front, and despite her sad personal problems the jury agreed. ‘And I don’t believe again, I’m afraid, what I have heard from Miss Port.’ Louise Port was supported at Southwark Crown Court in London today by her father Campbell (pictured) The former journalist, who has also worked for the BBC, has six months to pay or faces being jailed. The judge said: ‘The period for this amount of money is up to two years imprisonment but I will pass a period of one year’s imprisonment in default of payment.’ The Scot, who now rents a flat in Charing Cross, central London, must sell the Isleworth flat she bought when she was 20 to repay the cash. She had earlier told the court she could afford to pay back just £74,000 and tried to claim her father owned a 27 per cent of the property, which she bought in 1996 for £89,000. It has now more than trebled in price and is worth around £300,000. However, Alexandra Ward, prosecuting, said that the £25,000 he gave her to buy it was ‘a gift from a father to daughter,’ not a registered investment, and accused Port of making it up to avoid paying back the full amount. Port was found guilty at a previous hearing at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) of wrongly claiming £76,157 in housing benefit between September 2006 and August 2011 . Port, who also worked . for Radio 1, Radio 5 Live and read the sports news on the Chris . Evans Breakfast Show, was convicted of four counts of housing benefit . fraud - three of making dishonest representations to obtain benefit and . one of failing to declare a change in circumstances. At a sentencing hearing in February, the court heard how she failed to declare . that she was receiving more than £1,000-a-month in rent from a flat that . she owned near Canary Wharf. It was also revealed she had £87,000 in equity on the property and was also receiving £1,150 a . month from a property in the West End. Port, who used to have long blonde . hair but now sports a shaved head, today works in nightclubs and as a . nursing assistant at University College Hospital to make ends meet. In 2008, Port lost a £500,000 disability discrimination and unfair dismissal claim against GMTV after insisting she was forced out for refusing to work night shifts because of her epilepsy.","Louise Port told to repay more than £100,000 to City of Westminster Council .

"By . Tara Brady . Police have launched a new bid to charge serial child killer Robert Black with the murder of 13-year-old schoolgirl Genette Tate who disappeared 36 years ago. Devon and Cornwall Police have long suspected Black of murdering Genette, who was last seen in a rural lane in Aylesbeare, Devon, in 1978. Her body has never been found. However, there now hope for a prosecution in the case after Black last year lost an appeal against his latest conviction for the murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy. Police have long suspected Robert Black (left) of murdering Genette Tate (right) who vanished in 1978 . He had argued that his trial was prejudiced because details about three other child murders he had already been jailed for were revealed to the jury. Police told the BBC they are now liaising with the Complex Case Unit of the Crown Prosecution Service to see if the appeal court ruling has 'any bearing on the Genette Tate case'. They added: 'This liaison is still at a very early stage and will take some time to complete.' Black was found guilty in 1994 of three child murders in the 1980s - those of 11-year-old Susan Maxwell, from the Scottish Borders, five-year-old Caroline Hogg, from Edinburgh, and Sarah Harper, 10, from Morley, near Leeds. Mystery: Genette Tate's abandoned bicycle was found lying in a Devon lane in August 1978 . His reign . of terror finally ended in 1990 when he was caught red-handed with a . six-year-girl hooded, bound, gagged and stuffed in a sleeping bag in the . back of his van in the Scottish village of Stow. He had sexually assaulted her moments earlier. In . 2012 he was prosecuted for a fourth murder, that of Jennifer, who was . snatched as she cycled to a friend’s house in Ballinderry, County . Antrim, Northern Ireland, in 1981. The paedophile is serving a total of 12 life sentences for murder and kidnap. Genette’s . father, John Tate, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that he hoped . police had not overlooked any other suspect by spending time focusing on . Black. Black was found guilty of murdering Susan Maxwell, 11 (left) and Sarah Harper, 10 (right) Asked . how he had coped in the decades since Genette went missing, Mr Tate . said it had been difficult as the incident was never far from his mind. 'You look at everything that it could possibly be to do with her. You just cope very poorly sometimes.'Mr Tate said he believed the police had coped very well with the case. The . mystery remains Britain’s longest running missing person inquiry but . police have admitted that she was kidnapped and murdered. Genette was 13 when she vanished while delivering newspapers in her home village of Aylesbeare in East Devon in August 1978. Black last year lost an appeal against his latest conviction for the murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy . The . police have asked the Crown Prosecution Service’s Complex Casework Unit . to examine whether Black can be brought to trial for Genette’s murder. Yesterday Genette’s father John said: 'I want them to go ahead and put Black before a court. 'Let a jury decide whether he did it. I want to know what he did with her.' Speaking from his home in Manchester, Mr Tate, 72, who is battling cancer, diabetic and is in a wheelchair: 'I am not 100 per cent Black is responsible. I have a little bit of doubt. 'I think about her every day. It is a nightmare that never goes away. Despite what other people say, we will never get closure. 'It is so difficult because we will never know the answers to our questions. We don’t know if she was buried in some isolated spot or whether she was left wandering around somewhere. 'I would love to be able to find out where he is an finally be able to lay her to rest after nearly 40 years of this living hell.' A senior police source said that if the attempt to use bad character evidence was unsuccessful, detectives may once again interview Black in prison. But the officer said, it was 'a long shot' as Black has previously refused to co-operate when officers had been to Wakefield jail to see him. One former detective said previously: 'Black played a game. He wanted to barter. He wanted a move to a Scottish jail and would not talk until he got his way.' He also refused to meet Genette’s father John who wrote to him and asked him for a face to face meeting. Robert Black refused to meet Genette's father who wrote to him and asked if they could meet . Police from different forces spent months trying to track Black’s movements in relation to various child murder cases. They were able to say the former delivery driver had been spotted by Exeter airport - a short distance from Genette’s home village of Aylesbeare - and used petrol receipts to see where he had been travelling - but it is was never enough evidence to pursue a murder charge. Tim Swarbrick, a retired Devon and Cornwall Police Superintendent, said: 'Cases like this are never closed. It would mean a great deal to the police and the community to see the mystery of Genette’s disappearance finally solved.' Black was arrested by Devon and Cornwall Police in 2005 in connection with Genette’s disappearance but there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.

"By . Wills Robinson . Passengers on a late-night train service were treated to an impromptu concert when a man stood up and started a sing-song. The unidentified man attracted awkward stares from passengers travelling on the 12.07am service from London Victoria towards Ashford International, Kent, on Friday night when he stepped into the aisle. But within minutes the group of around 50 people in the carriage were joining in chorus. Scroll down for video . Audience: The grey-haired man in a beige suit attracted awkward stares when he stood up and launched into a rendition of the standard Side by Side . Audience: Around 50 passengers on the service between London Victoria and Ashford International were treated to the impromptu concert . At first he began singing a collection of random words, getting his fellow passengers to repeat after him. He then found a conductor's hat and began a rendition of Side by Side, a standard written by Gus Kahn and Harry M Woods in 1927. Even when the man got off the train, the passengers were in such good spirits they began their own rendition of Oasis’ Wonderwall to pass the remaining minutes of their journey. Passenger George Haswell, 24, filmed the whole episode on the 12.07am service. The quantity surveyor, who was heading home to Maidstone after a work night out, said: 'It was so funny and entertaining. He was so amazing. Attire: After the first song, he then found a hat and began a rendition of Side by Side .

'We applaud him for his enthusiasm and think he deserves a big pat on the back for his efforts. Clearly there’s some top singing talent among our customers.' Side by Side has become a popular standard which has been performed by a number or artists. The most notable was in 1953 when pop and jazz singer Kay Starr released a version. It was also sung by Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello on the movie soundtrack for Hudson Hawk. Chorus line: At points, the man grabbed people from their seats and got them to join him in the aisle .

"By . Sarah Michael . When Juliet Moody was told off for breastfeeding her youngest child in a café, she decided to fight back with humour rather than outrage. But Ms Moody, 36, never anticipated that the folksy pop song she penned and uploaded online to make fun of the anti-public breastfeeding lobby would strike such a chord with mothers around the world. The tongue-in-cheek Ruin Your Day - which she performs with 31-year-old Catherine Crowley, the other half of her band Sparrow-Folk – recently hit more than half a million views on YouTube and when combined with hits on Vimeo the song has been viewed over 800,000 times. Scroll down for video . Catherine Crowley (left) and Juliet Moody (right) of band Sparrow-Folk have struck a chord with their anti-breastfeeding outrage pop song Ruin Your Day . 'Everybody knows new mothers are exhibitionists,' the duo sings in the pop song. 'Taking every chance they get to ruin your day with t*ts. 'Pretending their little ones need a comfort or a feed. 'Taking every chance they get to ruin your day with t*ts.' Ms Moody said she and Ms Crowley, both from Canberra, had been blown away by the response around the world and the song had been translated into 10 different languages. The music video has received more than 800,000 views across YouTube and Vimeo . The video pokes fun at people who get offended by new mothers breastfeeding in public . 'We're so grateful for the response we've got and we've just been thrilled,' she told MailOnline. 'Hopefully people will lighten up about the issue and take the pressure off breastfeeding mums.' Ms Moody, a mother of four children aged between 15 months and 15 years, was breastfeeding her youngest child when another café customer made a snide remark under his breath. 'I was just breastfeeding in a café and he was a young man who obviously thought I was ruining his day by feeding my child,' she said. Ms Moody was inspired to write the song after a young man said something snarky to her when she was breastfeeding in a cafe . 'To be honest I'm paraphrasing him but it was along the lines that I should have a bit more respect. 'I was quite floored at a time. I'm not quite sure how respect comes into it.' Rather than respond directly to man, she used sarcasm to write a song and she thinks that's what helped the video go viral. '[The breastfeeding in public debate] has always been tackled from someone getting criticised and then it comes up in the media but we took the issue on head on,' she said. 'Because we used humour, instead of a responsive reaction, I think it's been empowering for people and I think that's why people have got behind it. The folk duo decided to fight the stigma against public breastfeeding with humour rather than outrage . 'I guess what we were trying to do was put the attention on the bystanders rather than the feeders.' Since releasing the song in February the folk duo have performed at the Adelaide Fringe Festival and they are in talks to take their show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival next year. They're also currently producing their next film clip which will be released in early July. Ms Moody says the song is similar to Ruin Your Day and makes light of a social issue. 'It's something probably a bit more comical but we're looking at the battle of the sexes,' she said. Ruin Your Day has since been translated into 10 languages . 'It's kind of a marriage-related topic which we're keeping under wraps.' While the response to Ruin Your Day has been mostly positive, they have received some nasty comments online. 'Like anything when things go out on YouTube you only have to read the comments to see people's negative feedback,' she said. 'But not directly, we haven't had any direct negative comments. 'We're certainly aware that our view isn't the view of everyone. For us that just shows there's even more reason to put it out there.'","Ruin Your Day by Canberra band Sparrow-Folk goes viral around the world .

"By . Tara Brady . Nicola Starr died of a fatal overdose after she was forced to give up her dreams of becoming a mother . A devoted wife died of a fatal drug overdose after she was forced to give up her dreams of becoming a mother. Nicola Starr, 37, had wanted children with sales manager husband Paul, 45, yet was unable to conceive naturally. She underwent IVF treatment but it failed when she miscarried their child and she slipped into bouts of depression. The brunette, described by family friends as 'the brightest star', survived several attempts to kill herself with overdoses of paracetamol tablets and on one occasion she jumped off a bridge. She was found eventually dead on her sofa at home in Blackpool, Lancashire, by husband of 12 years Mr Starr. Tests showed she had succumbed to the combined effects of drugs she had been taking for a back injury. At a Blackpool inquest Mrs Starr’s sister Natalie Towers, 31, said the former care worker had a history of depression brought on by her inability to have children. She was prescribed anti-depressants but began drinking heavily was given powerfully painkillers for her back pain. Mrs Towers said: 'The depressions was brought on by an inability to conceive naturally, this coupled with other big changes, failed IVF and a miscarriage and then redundancy. 'When Nicola was was very sick she felt she was not keeping the medication down so she took more than prescribed. 'She didn’t believe it would harm her because she had built up a tolerance to the drugs.' She said Mrs Starr had been looking forward to going away with her family to celebrate her grandmother’s birthday and had even had her hair and nails done. Sister Natalie Towers (far left), an unknown man, husband Paul Starr (wearing white shirt) and mother Janet Caldwell (far right) at the inquest into Nicola Starr's death at Blackpool Town Hall . But she added: 'There were suicide attempts but months and weeks leading up to her death she was making positive steps and was attending one-to-one counselling. 'We are sure she did not intentionally take her own life. She was looking forward to the future. 'All of Nicola’s previous suicide attempts were when she was intoxicated - she said she didn’t know or remember anything.' Mr Starr said his wife began drinking following the fertility treatment being stopped in January 2008.He said: 'It was quite rapid after that, she turned to drink. 'We both had long standing jobs which changed but the main reason for the depression and drinking was the infertility. 'She was getting help for the alcohol dependency, the problem was it was hard to get help and then she would make it quite easy for them to back off, she would miss appointments, wouldn’t answer the door. She wasn’t in the right frame of mind.' He said his wife had openly spoke about suicidal thoughts which had been 'a shock to the family'. He added: 'She did express that intention. 'On previous occasions with overdoses she never knew what was in her mind but most of the time it was on occasions when she had had a drink. 'After the event she was only vague in recollection.' Nicola Starr (right) was found dead on her sofa at home (left) in Blackpool, Lancashire . In the weeks before her death she had muscle, ligament and nerve damage in her arm and pains in her pelvis as a result of her fall from the bridge in November 2011. She had spent three months in hospital but was in so much pain she would sleep downstairs so not to disturb her husband. Mr Starr said: 'She always insisted she was in intolerable pain. When she wasn’t feeling the pain she would try and do more which would cause more pain. 'If the pain started to get less she would try to do more. It was like a vicious cycle she got into. 'Whatever pain treatment she took, the pain seemed to be unbearable. The amount of time she had been on these pain killers she built up a tolerance. It just seemed really large amounts of pain relief and insisted she was still in pain.' Mrs Starr’s mother Janet Caldwell, 55, said: 'She would cry, say she was sick of taking medication. 'She just wanted to be normal. She didn’t want to be on all the medication, she just wanted to work.' Toxicology reports showed that Mrs Starr had no alcohol present in her blood. Blackpool coroner Alan Wilson said he did not believe Mrs Starr had taken her own life adding that she had displayed a 'positive outlook’ for her future. Recording a narrative verdict he said: 'There was no note and no expression of intent. I have taken on board the family evidence in terms of her positive outlook. 'This was someone who clearly made significant attempts on her life, in the context of having a drink but this doesn’t seem to be the case here.' The family are currently raising money for Infertility Network UK a national infertility charity, dedicated to the support of everyone affected by infertility. A message from the family after her death read: 'Hope you are at peace now Nicky and free from pain. 'Will be always missed, remembered and never ever forgotten.'

FIFA investigator Michael Garcia will take into account the evidence revealed in the Sunday Times investigation before submitting his report on allegations of corruption in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. In fact, senior FIFA sources said on Monday night that Garcia was already in possession of the documents central to the expose before the story was printed at the weekend. ‘It would be naive to think otherwise,’ said the source. The investigatory chamber of the FIFA ethics committee - chaired by Garcia - responded to the reports yesterday by issuing a statement. Investigator: Michael Garcia will submit a report on allegations of corruption in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups . It said: ‘After months of interviewing witnesses and gathering materials, we intend to complete that phase of our investigation by June 9, 2014, and to submit a report to the Adjudicatory Chamber approximately six weeks thereafter. The report will consider all evidence potentially related to the bidding process, including evidence collected from prior investigations.’ Officials at the ethics committee office refused to elaborate but the timing is clearly designed to defuse the issue for FIFA’s annual congress in Sao Paulo next week and the duration of the World Cup. On Monday there were further calls for a re-vote for the hosts of the 2022 tournament, amid claims that disgraced Qatari former FIFA vice-president Mohamed Bin Hammam had made secret payments amounting to £3million to secure votes for his country. The claims have been vehemently denied by the bid team in Qatar. But Lord Goldsmith, a member of FIFA’s independent governance committee, said the world governing body needed ‘to produce a convincing and transparent answer to these allegations’. ‘I believe that if these allegations are shown to be true, then the hosting decision for Qatar has to be rerun,’ he told the BBC.

"By . Daniel Martin . David Cameron last night told the EU it had become ‘too big, too bossy and too interfering’ as he warned his fellow leaders not to ignore the Eurosceptic surge sweeping the continent. The Prime Minister travelled to Brussels to demand the union be dramatically scaled back in the wake of election results in which millions expressed their disdain for the European project. At dinner with the 27 other leaders, he warned them not to ‘shrug off’ the view of the European people that Brussels should hand back power to national governments. As well as Ukip topping the polls in Britain, anti-EU groups did well in countries from Germany to Greece. David Cameron spoke to journalists after arriving for tonight's European summit in Brussels . More worryingly, the far-Right National Front took first place in France for the first time.Emboldened by the Eurosceptic surge, Mr Cameron vowed to do all he can to prevent arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker from getting the EU’s top job, President of the European Commission. Mr Juncker is one of the most vocal supporters in the EU of the federalist dream of a United States of Europe. Arriving in the Belgian capital after visiting a building site in London, Mr  Cameron said he would only support candidates who understood that the EU needed to change. Dinner: Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt in Brussels . ‘Europe cannot shrug off these results,’ he said. ‘We need an approach that recognises that Brussels has got too big, too bossy, too interfering. He added: ‘It should be nation states wherever possible and Europe only where necessary.’ Mr Cameron has pledged an in/out referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017 – after he has renegotiated the return of powers from Brussels. Many of his backbenchers are concerned that the Ukip surge in the European elections mean he has not gone far enough for voters. Some are calling for a formal pact with Nigel Farage’s party for next year’s general election. Nigel Farage was congratulated during a meeting of the leaders of European Parliament political groups in Brussels today . The Prime Minister believes he has built up an alliance of countries in opposition to the old idea of ever-closer European union – and European Parliament results will spook many leaders into joining him. Mr Cameron said European leaders needed to appoint a new EU President who wanted to scale back Brussels power - not increase it . He spoke to France’s President Hollande yesterday morning to urge him to come on board. Mr Cameron is understood to be emboldened by his TV address on Sunday night, in which he called for the EU to ‘reform’. The Prime Minister also held a phone conversation with German chancellor Angela Merkel. But in a blow to the PM, she yesterday said her party was still supporting Mr Juncker. He may also seek the support of Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, whose father-in-law is Neil Kinnock, and who famously joined Mr Cameron and Barack Obama for a ‘selfie’ at Nelson Mandela’s funeral. She may be moved by the strong showing of the far-Right Danish People’s Party in the European elections, as they won 27 per cent of the vote and doubled their number of MEPs. Mr Juncker is the candidate of the European People’s Party. The present President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, will step down towards the end of the year. The decision of who will succeed him is likely to be put off until late June. Douglas Alexander, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman, said: ‘Mr Cameron seems either unwilling or unable to set out what changes  he wants to see at an EU level.’","PM wants to stop Jean-Claude Juncker becoming the next EU President .

Chelsea could live to regret allowing Frank Lampard to leave Stamford Bridge after 13 years and a club-record 211 goals, according to Harry Redknapp. Lampard confirmed on Monday evening that he will quit the Blues this summer, with the 35-year-old widely tipped to join Sheikh Mansour’s new Major League Soccer franchise New York City FC. And QPR boss Redknapp, speaking at a press conference on Monday morning, felt the Blues may rue deciding to let his nephew go. Fond farewell: Frank Lampard is leaving Chelsea after 13 years, 648 appearances and 211 goals . Stay: QPR boss Harry Redknapp says he would have kept Lampard at Chelsea to help develop youngsters . 'Absolutely I would keep him at Chelsea,' Redknapp said of Lampard, who joined the west London club from West Ham in 2001. 'He’s worth his weight in gold just to be around the place. 'I think Roy (Hodgson) feels the same. You need good characters around whether it is England or your football club. 'You’ve got (Steven) Gerrard and Lampard with England - proper guys that the youngsters can look up to.' The MLS season does not start until March, so 103-cap England midfielder Lampard could seek a short-term Barclays Premier League loan, with Redknapp’s newly promoted QPR among the potential suitors. Lampard claimed 11 major trophies during his 13 years at Stamford Bridge, making 648 club appearances and becoming the club’s all-time leading goalscorer. US-bound? New York City FC are the hot favourites to capture Lampard's signature for next season . Loan: Redknapp's recently promoted QPR side could try and tempt Lampard with a short-term deal . Redknapp feels Lampard may have decided to chase a new challenge while he is still just fresh enough to offer a major impact at a new club. 'Maybe if he’s going to go, now’s the time,' the former Tottenham boss said. 'I’m sure he’ll be focused on the World Cup now - he won’t be thinking about much else. 'It could be exciting to go to New York, though - a new project over there - but he’ll be successful in whatever he wants to do. 'The only person Frank would ask for advice is his dad, but he’ll know, he’s a very shrewd boy. 'He’s got his girlfriend as well, and they might fancy New York for a couple of years.

'I went out to Seattle and it’s a great time, a fantastic experience,' he said. 'Thierry Henry’s out there now and Jermain Defoe, but in the 1970s there were much better players out there! 'Seriously, though, you had Franz Beckenbauer, Johan Cruyff, Gerd Muller, Pele and Carlos Alberto. 'Most of that great Dutch team of the 1970s went out there, and even Bobby Moore and George Best at points too.

The Wales wing arrived at  Northampton last summer with a reluctant superhero’s aura, acquired on the strength of his stirring deeds for the Lions in Australia. In his first season for the Saints, the 22-year-old has moved heaven and earth to live up to his reputation and while his club are delighted with his endeavours, he has found it hard to fulfil his billing on a weekly basis. D-day: Northampton's George North prepares to take on Saracens in the Aviva Premiership final on Saturday . Superman: George North will be relied upon when Northampton face Saracens in the Aviva Premiership final . Great expectations: George North earned his reputation for his heroics on Lions tour of South Africa . ‘Coming here, it’s like Superman — my Kryptonite is the fact that I can’t get myself going every time,’ he said ahead of Saturday’s Aviva  Premiership final against Saracens at Twickenham. ‘The season is so long and it’s been tough just trying to stay in one piece. ‘Off the back of the Lions, I have come with a bit of expectation on my head. I sometimes feel like I haven’t done as much as I was  hoping and I’ve been marked out of some games. ‘I’m my own worst critic but at the same time it’s not been too bad considering it’s been after a Lions tour, it’s such a long season and I’ve moved to a new place. I’ve got to give myself a bit of leeway.’ North may self-analyse with a harsh eye but he is a fundamentally positive character so critical reflection soon gives way to satisfaction about his move from Llanelli to the East Midlands. Last week, Northampton won the Amlin Challenge Cup and now they are one win away from the league title, so their high-profile signing has enjoyed being part of a team success even sooner than he had dared to imagine. The environment he has found himself in is similar to the one he left behind in Wales. ‘Rugby is king here,’ he said. ‘Rugby is god. It’s quite like Wales because everyone gets involved but it’s a bigger  goldfish bowl. It’s more of a pond! Everyone has been super-kind. Walking round the supermarket, I’ll be choosing my bananas and  people will come up and say “Good luck on Saturday, we’ll be there”.’ Food and drink references occur frequently as North considers his existence in English rugby. Asked if he has now come to terms with public attention at such a young age, he added: ‘It’s chips and rice — half and half. I’m more aware of it now since coming back from the Lions tour. Silverware: George North (holding trophy) celebrates wining the Amblin Challenge Cup with Northampton . ‘It’s part of the job but I sometimes find it difficult dealing with that — the other half of rugby. I still find it strange when people want to hear my opinion because I just think I talk rubbish most of the time — I haven’t got too much wisdom!’ He came into the Premiership with a notion of what the game would be like. As a Welshman with an outsider’s perspective of English rugby, North expected an endless routine of arm-wrestle contests and limited openings out wide. Since then he has changed his mind — to an extent. ‘I would say it is 75 per cent the same as I thought it would be,’ he said. ‘It is very physical. They love to maul it. They love a forwards game. But I’m quite lucky that at Northampton we do play quite an open game. That helps me. Other clubs like Bath, Sarries, Quins also play some beautiful rugby. ‘It is not just stick-it-up-the-jumper rugby all the time so my perception was wrong in a way. You’ve got what I call the boring bits — scrums, lineouts and mauling. You need that sometimes, especially if you have a dominant pack. But you also need the va-va-voom!’ Entert the dragon: Northampton takes rugby as seriously as in his homeland Wales, says George North . That’s where North comes in. He has provided vivid flashes of that game-breaking quality, such as when he carved Gloucester open at Kingsholm early in the campaign, to set up the try of the season for Jamie Elliott. He has savoured a handful of games when he has gone through his full repertoire but also the major team landmarks such as beating Leicester in the semi-final at a fervent Franklin’s Gardens. ‘That whole experience will stay with me forever,’ he said. ‘It was awesome. It was epic.’ Along the way, there have been times when the cape has slipped off his weary shoulders — when the Kryptonite of weekly demand has dragged him down. ‘Now and again I’ve thought, “I could do with a week off”,’ he said. ‘This season has been really hard but I’ve really enjoyed it, too. ‘I am looking forward to some time off. I love my job but it is good to get away from it occasionally. I worked out the other day that by the time this season is over I’ll have been going for two years and a  couple of months without a  substantial break, so this summer will be great. ‘People keep asking me if I’m going away but I’m not. The only thing I’ve booked is to go to  Glasgow to see Becky (girlfriend cyclist Becky James) racing in the  Commonwealth Games. Apart from that it will just be nice to go home, sit down and have a cup of tea with my mum, go for a ride on my bike and play a bit of golf. I need the break, mentally more than anything.’ Long season: George North admits there are times when he has wanted to take a week off . Before that welcome respite North has three more monumental occasions ahead of him. He expects a titanic tussle with Saracens and doesn’t dare hope that their Heineken Cup final defeat against Toulon last week will have broken their spirit. ‘Saracens will be wounded but they will dust themselves off and go again,’ he said. ‘They have been the dominant team in the Premiership this  season and they’ve got a great chance to win silverware this  weekend, but so do we.’ When the domestic duties are over he will join Wales for two Tests in South Africa. It looms as a  gruelling assignment for a side missing the likes of captain Sam Warburton and Leigh Halfpenny, but North believes the tourists have enough quality in their ranks to mount a compelling challenge. ‘There was talk they were going to rest some boys but you can’t go to South Africa with semi-skimmed milk,’ he said, in metaphor mode again. ‘We have to throw everything at them. People won’t expect much of us but no-one expected much of us going to the last World Cup and we came out strong. We’ve still got a hell of a squad. We’re taking as much firepower as possible.’","Saints George North admits feeling the weight of expectation .

The prince showed off his goalkeeping skills on a visit to the Inspire Suffolk community project in Ipswich.

Just days after shocking video footage of the 22-year-old apparently smoking cannabis in Peru emerged, it has been revealed that the singer plans to buy the League One side. But, lifelong Rovers fan Tomlinson - who even made an appearance for the club's reserves team earlier this year - is said to be concerned the recent controversy could jeopardise his chances. VIDEO Scroll down for Teen fans go wild as Louis Tomlinson turns out for Doncaster Rovers . One Direction's Louis Tomlinson, 22, has made a formal bid to buy League One side Doncaster Rovers and negotiations are said to be at an 'advanced stage' Louis, who was born in Doncaster, is a lifelong fan of Rovers and even made a professional appearance for the reserves team in February after signing to the club's books last summer . He has now taken his love for the club one step further - by joining forces with businessman John Ryan, who previously owned the club before selling off a large share to a consortium . According to The Sun, a source said: ‘The timing of . the Peru video has really upset him because he doesn’t want anything to . jeopardise the deal, which is very commercially sensitive and worth a . seven-figure sum.’ The pop star was embroiled in controversy this week after exclusive . MailOnline footage of him and bandmate Zayn Malik, 21, showed them smoking a suspicious looking roll-up. Neither have addressed the video but Louis is said to be concerned the 'scandal' could hinder his plans to takeover his hometown club. The singer, who was born in Doncaster, is a season-ticket holder at Rovers and made . his professional appearance for the reserves team in February after . signing to the club’s books last summer. He now plans to . take his love for the club one step further – by joining forces with . businessman John Ryan, who previously owned the club before selling off a . large share to a consortium. The pair are said to be in the . process of setting up a trust to buy the recently-relegated side and . negotiations of a formal bid are said to be at an ‘advanced stage’. It . is thought Tomlinson and Mr Ryan – who still owns a quarter share of the . club – will act as co-chairmen if their bid is successful. The . pair, who hope to become the new owners as early as July, have . ambitions to take the club back to the Championship within a year and . into the Premiership within three. 'Joint . lit. Happy days!'  Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson smoked a 'roll up . cigarette' and joke about marijuana in a video taken in Lima, Peru, last . month . Hit . maker: Zayn takes a draw on the roll up. Before they began their . journey someone can be heard asking: 'Are we allowed to talk contraband . in this?' Warm up: Louis can be heard joking that 'Mary J' is 'one . very very important factor of Zayn’s warm up' Happy daze: At one point during the video, Louis asks: 'How is it Zayn?' Pausing a beat before he exhales Zayn replies: 'Nice'. Zayn blows smoke at the camera and says: 'I know you like dat, bro' Controversial: In . MailOnline’s exclusive video, Louis Tomlinson, 22, can be heard putting . on an accent while speaking about doing drugs. He then says: ‘It’s . green only, Nig.’ The insider said Tomlinson and Mr Ryan plan to buy the club – which was relegated from the Championship this season – outright. If successful, Tomlinson would be the . first pop star chairman of an English football club since Elton John . famously took over at Watford in 1976. ‘This . is his passion project – and it will happen. He’s putting everything . into it because of his love for the side,’ the source said. It . is hoped the singer will attract a number of new investors to the club . if he does purchase it – thanks to his worldwide following from One . Direction fans and supporters. He managed to draw a crowd of an additional 2,000 extra fans to the Keepmoat Stadium when he donned a Rovers shirt for a reserves match against Rotherham United in February. After the match, which ended 0-0, he told his 15.5 million Twitter followers: 'Wow what an incredible experience. Can't put into words how I feel. I will never forget pulling on my own Doncaster Rovers shirt! 'Really can't thank the team, the gaffer and every single person involved at Doncaster Rovers enough! I feel like a 10 year old again. 'And obviously a huge huge thank you to everyone who came down :) a real credit to our fans :) hope it was a good day out!' One Direction's Louis Tomlinson spent time with Doncaster's reserves side earlier this year and joined in with a training session (pictured) Louis managed to draw a crowd of an additional 2,000 extra fans at the Keepmoat Stadium when he donned a Rovers shirt for a reserves match against Rotherham United in February . However, many fans have turned their back on the star and One Direction after the controversial footage of him and Zayn talking about drugs and smoking a ‘joint’ emerged. Tomlinson has also been further lambasted for apparently using a racial slur in the video which was filmed as they were being escorted by car to a show in Lima, Peru, on April 27. In the footage, Louis uses the word 'nig' - which fans say is a shortened version of the N-word. One Direction fans - as well as MPs and racism campaigners – have demanded apologies from the band in light of the video. They say the boy band has abused their position as role models and risked encouraging their young fans to copy them. Even Tomlinson’s father, Troy Austin, 45, said he was ‘worried’ for his son after watching the controversial footage. He said his son had previously vowed to never touch drugs or get a tattoo and said ‘fame and money have changed him’. Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik didn't address the controversy when One Direction played at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on Wednesday night (pictured) Despite the band putting on a united show at the opening night of their tour, it is thought the scandal could create a divide in the band . Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said: ‘He’s a different person to that person three years ago. ‘I do believe that being that famous will be taking its toll on them. They need a serious talking to.’ However, the band have remained unusually quiet and didn’t make any apology for the controversy when they performed to 50,000 people at Sunderland football club's Stadium of Light on Wednesday for the opening night of their UK tour. The only reference made to the scandal was by bandmate Liam Payne, 20, who joked about his skinny jeans then, in response to something shouted by a member of the crowd, added: ‘No more media attention, please.’ Despite the band putting on a united show at the opening night of their tour, it is thought the scandal has created somewhat of a divide in the band. Harry Styles reportedly blasted Louis and Zayn for their ‘stupid and reckless’ antics, while it is also understood he and Niall Horan, 20, already take separate ‘non-smoking’ private jets to gigs to avoid their bandmates’ smoking.","Louis Tomlinson is 'setting up a trust to buy League One club in July'

"By . Martin Samuel - Sport . Billy Connolly had a theory. There were too many nuclear weapons in the world, he said, and not enough people being smacked in the mouth. Boxing, by its very nature, resolves that. A lot of people get smacked in the mouth in boxing. Yet it is not just the explosive small-scale violence that chimes with Connolly’s world view. What he was getting at, one presumes, is that many of the great conflicts and calamities of our age could have been solved by low level direct action a lot earlier. If a right-thinking person had put Benito Mussolini on his backside in 1919, do the fascists march on Rome in 1922? Simple: Forget the great conflicts and rivalries, one punch was all it took on Saturday night for Carl Froch . Champion: The Cobra defended his IBF and WBA world super-middleweight titles after beating George Groves . A good right-hander, as thrown by Carl Froch at Wembley on Saturday night, realigns even the most fervent uprising. And that reassessment was unavoidable once it landed. Suddenly, George Groves sat beside his conqueror for ringside interviews, a reduced, subdued, some would say broken figure. Words were redundant now. All the truth that was needed came in that right-hander. It told its own story: who was the champion, the better fighter, the winner and better man. Froch left Groves lying on the Wembley canvas like a character from the cartoon Family Guy. He fell as Peter Griffin falls: leg trapped beneath his body, arms splayed awkwardly. The difference being that Griffin is animated with limitless possibilities for the effects of misadventure, while Groves’ physical disorder was appallingly real. It was the doubled leg that offered the clue. Nobody in  command of his senses stays like that. Referee Charlie Fitch knew Groves was gone and called the contest off, immediately. And ended all speculation. Floored: The way Groves was knocked out at Wembley was similar to Peter Griffin from Family Guy (below) Please: Groves pleaded with the referee to let the fight continue but it was far too late... he'd blown it . Connolly, tongue-in-cheek,  imagined a swift, sudden end to confrontation, and Froch delivered it. Around the ring, supporters of both men were shouting the odds, debating the points, calling the shots. Some had Groves ahead, like one of the judges, but a good right-hander renders all previous notation or nuance irrelevant. Who won the sixth? Suddenly, it did not matter. Connolly thought a good punch might prevent the nuclear option, but there was something of the red button about the way Froch finished this fight, too. He modestly stated that he was not a knockout puncher — and not in a sly way of putting Groves down, either, although it no doubt provoked an inner wince from those with affection for the Londoner — but one cannot imagine many in the super-middleweight division, and a fair few heavier, that would have remained upright after that. It was a thing of beauty. Each replay met with louder and louder gasps and groans from those watching Wembley’s big screens. It put one in mind of Lennox Lewis’s knockout of Hasim Rahman in 2001, another brutal right that ended a rematch, and a conversation. That's gotta hurt: Froch's punch was a thing of beauty, similar to Lennox Lewis' on Hasim Rahman in 2001 . Before the fight, opinion was divided about whether Lewis had the heart, the will, the ability to regain his crown. Lewis hushed that talk in four, Rahman struggling to get up like a zoo animal hit with a tranquiliser dart. Froch said he had delivered blows as devastating, but not as momentous. ‘The history of the fight, the way people will look back on it in years to come, that was the punch that finished it off,’ he said. ‘In that way, it was probably the best punch I’ve landed in my life. It closed the show, and that’s what world-class fighters do. ‘My legacy was definitely at stake. My career was over if I lost tonight. I would have retired. This was the biggest post-War fight in Britain and I didn’t want to be remembered as the loser of it. So this was one of the most satisfying nights of my life. I’ve had the weight of the world on my shoulders, I’ve had George Groves in my ear for a year. ‘He was on at me before the Mikkel Kessler fight in May 2013. I haven’t heard the end of it. I knew within 48 hours of the first fight that this rematch had to happen.’ No other athletes are confronted with legacy talk like boxers. Tough: The pair had to conduct post-match interviews after, with Froch admitting his legacy was at stake . Legacy: Sir Alex Ferguson was an exception of those who would have to face the questions Froch does . Typically, only men like Sir Alex Ferguson, three decades at the Old Trafford coal face, field  questions about their standing in the pantheon. The day Tiger Woods retires, or Usain Bolt, it will be considered, too. Yet all boxers are required to assess. Froch is an outstanding fighter, among the best of his generation, yet he still dreams of a major fight in Las Vegas. There are two boxers out there, Andre Ward and Gennady Golovkin of Kazakhstan, who would stand a good chance of defeating him. Ward, an American, has already done it. Perhaps that is why Froch is respected Stateside, but not revered. Nevertheless, the legacy questions came. Maybe, on a night when more than 80,000 filled Wembley — and more seats could have been sold were the public prepared to have their view entirely compromised — it simply felt like a consequential occasion. Froch may yet fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Vegas, but he is 36 now. His place in British  boxing history is assured and he is mindful of timing his farewell. Nobody wants to leave a loser. One more? Froch may face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (or others), his place in British boxing history is already assured . The future is uncertain for Groves, but in a darker way. He was damned with faint praise by Froch, who spoke of him as a future champion, but only if he learned to operate within his limitations. He needs to target a weaker belt-holder, seemed to be the message. ‘It’s about levels,’ Froch said. ‘He’s not quite got the toughness that you need at the top. I’ve got ingredients that you can’t teach. If I fight George Groves 10 times I’ll beat him 10 times. He’s got to prove to me he can take more than one punch like that. He’s missing the final ingredient, the ability to stand up against the top guys. I’m not a one-punch man. I’m not Mike Tyson. I’m a concussion puncher, but I flattened him tonight.’ Another moment of reflection, and he made the baying, brawling, boiling vat of humanity that spilled over on British boxing’s biggest night, suddenly seem a distant hum. ‘When did I do it?’ Froch mused. ‘Round eight? That’s another four-and-a-half rounds, 13 minutes or so. That’s a long time to be in front of me with them little gloves on.’ A lonely place, the ring. Maybe that’s why mankind worked so hard to invent those big bombs. The hand-to-hand stuff was just too horrible.","Froch retains IBF and WBA titles in rematch against Groves on Saturday .

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . and Nick Harris . Andrew Flintoff is set to cash in on his return to top-level cricket by taking a portion of the gate receipts for Lancashire’s Twenty20 home matches. It is understood that Flintoff, who is  hopeful of ending his five-year absence from the game on Friday as Lancashire host Roses rivals Yorkshire at Old Trafford, will receive £1 for every spectator who turns up over and above a pre-agreed figure —  possibly 8,000. The county’s two home matches so far in the Natwest T20 Blast have pulled in crowds of 5,300 against Worcestershire and 5,900 against Warwickshire. Laughing all the way to the bank: Andrew Flintoff will receive a payment per fan for Lancashire's home games . Last year’s home fixture against Yorkshire drew a crowd of over 12,000 — more than double the figure they achieved for any  of their four other Twenty20 games in Manchester. Since Jos Buttler, fresh from his heroic 121 off 74 balls in England’s defeat by Sri Lanka at Lord’s on Saturday, may also be available for selection for Lancashire, the opportunity will be there for Flintoff to add a few  thousand pounds to a deal that already includes appearance fees and win bonuses. Flintoff is dreaming of a return against bitter rivals Yorkshire, but insists he only wants to play if he proves this week he is good enough for ‘cricket reasons’. Freddie, 36, came through a low-key playing comeback on Saturday by helping St Annes beat Penrith in a lowly Northern Premier League game. Comeback: Flintoff returned to cricket when he played for St Annes on Saturday . Low key: The former England all-rounder took three wickets on his return to the game . He took three wickets including a stunning caught and bowled. But he knows if he gets selected for  Lancashire on the big stage now, somebody else will have to miss out and he does not want to get a game for sympathy reasons. ‘I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t think about playing against Yorkshire,’ said Flintoff. ‘It will be a full house, however, Friday is a long way away, it really is — if I get a  go, I get a go but I’m not by any means expecting to play. ‘On Thursday I’ve got a game with the Lancashire second team, which I’m just going to go out there and enjoy. I’m not going to put any undue pressure on myself  thinking that this is a trial for Friday or anything like that. I’m just going to play — and if I get picked, I get picked. ‘If I’m . going to play then someone else is going to miss out. They’ve got to be . comfortable that, when they tell the player who is missing out, it’s the . right decision for cricket reasons. And I need to be comfortable with . that as well. ‘So . it’s all down to cricket, down to what value I can give the side and . whether I can give more than the  person I take over from.’ After . Saturday’s cameo, which include facing three balls as a batsman before . being caught on the  boundary attempting a six, he stressed how the . competition for Lancashire is especially tough now. Realistic: Flintoff said he is not putting too much pressure on himself ahead of his comeback . Target: Flintoff has set his sights on playing against rivals Yorkshire on Friday night . ‘I’m not putting too much  pressure on myself,’ added Flintoff. ‘I’m not making big hopes. ‘I’m just going to see where it goes. I appreciate that Lancashire are on a roll in Twenty20s and there’s Jos Buttler and Jimmy Anderson and people to come back into that side. ‘So it’s not a gimme that I’m going to play. But I’m going to try to put myself in the frame. The comeback has just crept up on me. It’s not something that was a goal of mine, that I set out to do. ‘It has just come around quite  innocently and that’s been the nice thing about it. I’m not chasing anything. I’m just  enjoying it.

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . A year after considering quitting tennis, Andrea Petkovic is through to her first grand slam quarter-final for three years. In 2011, the popular German made the last eight at three of the four slams and was ranked in the top 10. But back, ankle and knee injuries over the next 18 months sent her ranking plummeting to 177 when she finally returned to the tour for good in March last year. Beaming: Germany's Andrea Petkovic celebrates after reaching the French Open quarter-finals . After losing in the second round of qualifying at Roland Garros last year, Petkovic thought about calling it a day. The 26-year-old said: 'It wasn't because I had lost in the second round against some player that was ranked 160. It wasn't about that. It was just I didn't like playing any more. I hated it. 'I was putting so much pressure on myself to get back where I was, and it wasn't fun any more. I was just forcing. Everything was work and hard. It wasn't what it was, why I started playing tennis. 'I started playing tennis because I love it and it's a big part of my life. It brought so much to me and my family. 'I think it brings so many people together, and it's a nice, a beautiful thing, and it's not something that is ugly and hard and difficult. 'That's what it was for me when I came back from my injuries. 'My footwork was off, my strokes were bad. My serve was bad. I hated it. That's why I wanted to stop. After that, I won a tournament, luckily, so I didn't, and I kept doing what I did. 'And now I'm here and it's a nice reward.' Back on form: Petkovic plays a forehand after her three-set victory in the fourth round . That title came in Marseille and final appearances in Nuremberg and Washington followed, while in April she won the biggest tournament of her career in Charleston. Petkovic is back to 27th in the rankings and on Monday beat surprise package Kiki Bertens 1-6, 6-2, 7-5 in the fourth round of the French Open. The draw has undoubtedly worked out well but Petkovic has taken advantage, albeit a little hesitantly this time. She said: 'I was really relieved that I picked myself up after I was up 4-2 in the third and I started playing a little passively. 'I wasn't going for my shots any more. I was sort of hoping that she was going to miss. She's too good for that. Respect: Petkovic shakes hands with opponent Kiki Bertens (left) after sealing victory . 'After going down 5-4 in the third, I just told myself, ""Okay, listen, you have to play aggressive. You have to go for your shots, and nobody's going to give you the quarter-finals just because you're nice, so go gain it"". 'I started playing more aggressively. It paid off in the end.' Petkovic will have to step up her game if she is to go any further with 2012 finalist Sara Errani up next. The 10th seed defeated sixth seed Jelena Jankovic 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in a minor upset to make the quarter-finals for the third straight year.

The Serbian was left to rue a missed opportunity, saying: 'It's a big disappointment, especially when you see the draw and who is left in the draw.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . As Manchester United try to find room for the Class of ’92 in the new order at Old Trafford, they should perhaps be more concerned over the future of a more recent graduate of their academy. It is hard to think of a more willing, less confrontational individual than Danny Welbeck. So when the 23-year-old England striker grows so unhappy that he considers leaving a club that has been part of his life since he was spotted by United at the age of eight, we should take notice. Last month, sources close to Welbeck revealed that he was ready to quit Old Trafford after the World Cup with two years still left on his contract. Their claims, largely confirmed by an interview the player gave over the weekend, suggested that he had grown disillusioned under David Moyes. Stay put: Manchester United must do all that they can in order to keep homegrown Danny Welbeck at the club . Problems: Welbeck felt like a 'victim' under the old regime, shunted out wide instead of playing centrally . He felt like ‘a victim’ of the new (now old) regime, they said, shunted out on to the left in a 4-2-3-1 formation that denied him the central striking role he prefers. Welbeck was also alarmed to hear comments from Moyes in December saying that he needed to work harder in training. The managerial change at Old Trafford might have headed off this particular crisis for now although, intriguingly, Welbeck refused to say if Moyes going would necessarily mean that he will stay. After all, Louis van Gaal is known to favour 4-3-3 and, for all his promise, Welbeck remains behind Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney in the pecking order for that central berth. As United prepare to welcome their new first continental coach and more foreign signings this summer, they need to keep homegrown players like Welbeck now more than ever, and not just for the purposes of European football that will not concern the fallen Premier League champions for another year. Ryan Giggs might have offered a glimpse into the future earlier this month when he gave first-team debuts to James Wilson and Tom Lawrence against Hull in his last home game in charge, but the days when local talent like Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers seemed to roll out of the academy on a conveyor belt are a distant memory. It was a vintage year, 1992, but have there been any like it since? What did you say?! David Moyes questioned the player's work rate in training while at United last season . Questions raised: Louis van Gaal prefers a 4-3-3 formation, which could be a struggle for Welbeck next year . Danny Welbeck may complain he was played out of position by David Moyes but his goals per game ratio was actually better under him than under Sir Alex Ferguson or Ryan Giggs . Welbeck under Moyes . Matches: 33. Goals: 10. Welbeck under Ferguson/Giggs . Matches: 106. Goals: 19 . United can still bring through top talent. Some, like Adnan Januzaj, stay. Others, like Paul Pogba, move on. But Januzaj and Pogba only moved to Old Trafford at the age of 16 from foreign clubs. Welbeck was brought up in nearby Longsight and joined at the age of 11. A local hero at a club whose proud history of producing players from within will forever be associated with the Busby Babes. Across town at Manchester City, the club’s Abu Dhabi owners recognise the importance of local identity and are desperate for Micah Richards – Birmingham-born and raised in Leeds – to sign a new contract even though the defender only made two Premier League appearances last season. He is unlikely to oblige. Of course, origin is of little importance without talent, but few would question Welbeck’s potential. He has come through United’s academy, paid his dues on loan at Preston North End and Sunderland, and established himself as first-team regular and possible World Cup starter for England. Talent: Adnan Januzaj has started brightly at Old Trafford but was only brought to the cub when he was 16 . Blooding: Tom Lawrence was given his chance by interim manager Ryan Giggs against Hull earlier this month . It has not always been easy. Of his 139 career appearances for United, 50 have come off the bench. Many more have been in that less preferable position out on the left. Last season he only scored two goals, although it is worth noting that one of those came during a career highlight at the Bernabeu when Welbeck almost single-handedly had Real Madrid on the ropes with his power and pace. Another 10 goals followed in 36 games for United in a difficult season under Moyes, but that still does not compare with Welbeck’s eight in 21 internationals for his country. ‘Maybe I’m kind of let off the leash a bit more for England,’ he admits. Of all the promising young strikers on United’s books down the years (Wilson and Will Keane are the latest), none have come closer to becoming a true star than Welbeck. As he heads off to Brazil this summer with the best years of his career still ahead of him, that is something the club and Van Gaal should bear in mind.","England striker could leave Old Trafford this summer .

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . England are building a ‘World Cup hub’ designed to digest data from all 64 games in Brazil and turn it into ammunition for Roy Hodgson and his team. In what is shaping up to be a tournament with a heavy sports science influence, the Football Association will use an operational nerve centre at St George’s Park, the national football centre, to blend traditional scouting methods with the modern desire for video analysis. England’s scouting team in Brazil will include Mike Rigg, the FA’s head of talent identification, Dan Ashworth, the FA’s director of elite development, Gareth Southgate, England’s Under-21 manager and scout John Marshall. Say cheese: England players pose in their suits for their World Cup team photo before flying out to Miami . They will study England’s potential opponents and compile match reports in the normal manner, noting popular set-piece routines and the strengths and weaknesses of players, before liaising with those at St George’s Park. The FA’s senior football analyst Steve O’Brien and his assistant Mike Baker will control the ‘World Cup hub’, where they will watch all 64 games played in Brazil and compile the facts and statistics. They will study each game in the company of different football specialists and scouts employed by the FA and the coaches who are based at St George’s Park. This information will then be packaged and sent to Hodgson’s backroom team in Rio de Janeiro and used to enhance England’s tactics and strategy in Brazil. There is friction developing inside football between the traditionalists, who value the eye and instinct of those steeped in football, and the technophiles who are embracing the masses of data and evidence now available. This is the FA’s bid to carefully combine the two but it is fair to say no England football team will have embarked on a World Cup adventure armed with quite so much sports science expertise. Hodgson, a traditionalist who is fairly open-minded about the advance of scientific data, will be able to use it to monitor the reaction of his players to the heat - they use heart-rate monitors and GPS tracking technology in training - and tactically within games if he wants. All aboard: The England squad have flown to Miami to continue their World Cup preparations . Even after the tournament, the information gathered at the hub will be used to consider successful trends and strategies in international football, in the same way as a technical report. Much of this comes into the realm of Dave Reddin, formerly Sir Clive Woodward’s right-hand man in England rugby union and consultant to the BOA, who is the FA’s new head of performance services and will be in Brazil. Reddin’s brief, according to the FA upon his appointment, was to ‘create new tournament strategies aimed at increasing success’. Ashworth has described his role in the operation as ‘pivotal’. Woodward applauded the idea to employ Reddin when it was confirmed last year and said: ‘Dave is right up to date with everything going on in sport.’ There are two video analysis experts . among the support staff for the World Cup: Andy Scoulding from Liverpool . and Laurence Stewart from Hull City. Coach Gary Neville often spends . the first half of England games in the stands studying the video . technology and reporting back to Hodgson at half-time. England's itinerary for this summer's World Cup in Brazil . The Barclays Premier League stopped clubs installing TV monitors and laptops in the dug-outs, mainly to avoid pressure on officials after slow-motion replays and different camera angles highlifht poor decisions.

Jonesy says beating Kyle was like 'Coyote catching the Road Runner' By . Daniel Van Boom . They've been Sydney's top radio duo for over seven years and 55 FM surveys. But on Tuesday it was announced that KIIS FM's Kyle & Jackie O show was dethroned from the number one radio spot by ARN stablemates, Jonesy & Amanda. It will be a real blow to the ego for the shock jock and his blonde co-host, who defected from 2DayFM last year after bosses refused Sandilands' demand to double his salary from $2million to $4million. Popping bottles! Brendan 'Jonesy' Jones and Amanda Kelly celebrate their placing first in the Sydney breakfast radio spot. It marks the first time in seven years Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'Jackie O' Henderson haven't snagged the top spot . The first survey of the year in April saw the Kyle and Jackie O emerged triumphant on their new network, but the numbers have now dipped. Sandilands and Jackie Henderson lost 1.4% from their previous 10.9% share, giving them of 9.5% of the pie, while Brendan 'Jonesy' Jones and Amanda Keller enjoyed a massive boost from 8.2% to a 10% share. Keller insists the KIISFM team were 'very gracious,' in defeat after Tuesday's announcement, adding: 'Their whole team came in today to say congratulations.' However Sandilands didn't join Jackie O and the rest of the team - he had called in sick before the results were announced. Seven years on top: The Kyle & Jackie O show reigned supreme for 55 straight survey results. They moved from 2DayFM to KIIS FM earlier this year and managed to bring their massive audience with them . But Jonesy wasn't fussed by the absence of his competitor, saying 'I don't think he'd really care.' He said beating the pair was like 'Coyote catching the Road Runner'. 'Honestly, I am stunned,' Jones added. 'It’s like the great white whale.' 'When we first started working together nine years ago we went No.1,' Keller explained of the victory, 'and it was our running joke that no one ever said we had to do it again.' Jonesy and Amanda said the WSFM team celebrated with champagne, lunch and karaoke. Also revealed in the survey was a drop for 2DayFM breakfast team, comprised of Sophie Monk, Merrick Watts, Jules Lund and Mel B, who now find themselves with a 3.5% share, while Nova 96.9's Fitzy & Wippa lose just under a full percent leaving them with 7.1% of the coveted audience. Meanwhile, MIX FM's Chrissie Swan and Jane Hall made the top Melbourne FM spot for the first time ever, beating out Eddie McGuire's Hot Breakfast on Triple M. Top of the mountain!

Kyle and Jackie O were 2DayFM's prized radio team before moving to KIISFM earlier this year, and taking their massive audience with them. The duo left Southern Cross Austereo station last November. They had been with the station for 13 years before moving to KIIS FM, where they first broadcast from in January of this year. When 2014's first survey results were released it appeared as though Sandilands may have been worth the money he demanded, as the Kyle & Jackie O show boosted the station's share from 4.9% to a whopping 8.8%. 2DayFM suffered a massive loss in the wake of the departure, with their ratings plunging from 8.7% to 4.2%.","Kyle and Jackie O left 2DayFM last year after a financial dispute .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Expelled: Lewis McLeod was expelled following an investigation into an alleged sexual assault but he never was subject to a criminal investigation . A former Australian soccer player who was expelled from Duke University after being accused of sexually assaulting another student, will have to wait an entire year to clear his name and receive his diploma. Lewis McLeod has won two of three legal battles so far in his court battle against Duke University. Judge Osmond Smith III, in North Carolina's Durham County Superior Court, issued a preliminary injunction on Thursday, ruling the university should not have expelled the 23-year-old. But the judge has so far declined to force the university to immediately give McLeod his degree. The matter will be heard at a later trial, which with no date set, could leave the former Sydney FC Academy soccer player waiting for a year to formally graduate with his psychology degree. But although Mr McLeod hopes to stay in the US for as long as it takes to clear his name, he could be forced to head home to Sydney before the trial date. Without his degree, Mr McLeod in unable to take up a job with a Wall Street firm in New York nor apply for a new visa. His current student is set to expire on May 11, leaving him with 60 days to depart the US. The 23-year-old has won two of three legal battles against the University, with the court issuing a preliminary injunction on Thursday which ruled that the university should not have expelled him . 'It’s up in the air right now. We're investigating what action we can take,' McLeod’s attorney Rachel Hitch told the Daily Telegraph. 'He is in a peculiar position because he's not expelled, not graduated and not enrolled. As far as student visas go it's hard to figure out where he falls.' Duke University's public affairs vice-president Michael Schoenfeld, praised the judge's ruling. 'We are pleased the court recognised the need to preserve the integrity of Duke's decision not to issue a degree at this point in the lawsuit,' he said. 'Duke follows federal legal requirements for complaints of student sexual misconduct and works very hard to make sure the process is fair and just in every case.' Scene: McLeod says that the sex he had at his home (pictured) with the young woman he met at a bar in November 2013 was consensual but she claims she was assaulted . Lewis McLeod was accused of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old female student in November and though the school expelled him after conducting his own investigation, the case was never pursued by law enforcement and he never faced criminal charges. On the team: Because of his student visa status, McLeod will be forced to return to Australia . McLeod filed a lawsuit alleging he was not given a fair hearing during the university's independent investigation and saying that without the diploma that he was originally due to receive earlier this month, his life is being put on a detrimental hold. McLeod also had to file legal action to sit his final exams, which he scored As, his lawyer said. The alleged sexual assault took place . on November 14 when McLeod, who played on the school's soccer team, . brought a young woman home from a local Durham, North Carolina bar. They . proceeded to have sex, and though he claims it was consensual, the . unidentified young woman 'got emotional' and started crying. She later contacted the local police and the school's police force. Duke's Office of Student Conduct conducted an investigation though it remains unclear why the local police did not pursue any charges. 'Throughout the hearing, members of the panel and the Office of Student Conduct made decisions that prevented Mr. McLeod from presenting his side of the story, denied him his right to respond to allegations against him and denied him his right to a fair and impartial hearing,' his attorneys wrote.","Lewis McLeod, an Australian who was on the soccer team at Duke University in North Carolina, is suing the school to get his diploma .

"Rolf Harris was yesterday accused of ‘deliberately lying’ during his trial after being confronted with dramatic new TV evidence. He is accused of molesting a teenager while filming a celebrity It’s a Knockout-type show in Cambridge during the 1970s – but claims he first visited the university city just four years ago. However, jurors at Southwark Crown Court were yesterday shown footage of Harris taking part in a show called Star Games filmed in Cambridge in 1978. Scroll down for video . After Rolf Harris previously denied having been to Cambridge earlier than four years ago, Southwark Crown Court was today shown a video of him appearing in a TV game show filmed in the city in the 1970s . Prosecutor . Sasha Wass QC told him the fresh evidence backed up the account of his . alleged victim, who said she was at the location when Harris groped her . bottom. But the veteran TV star replied: ‘I had no idea I was in Cambridge, and I don’t think the other performers or stars did either. ‘I was in Cambridge but I didn’t know I was in Cambridge.’ During . the opening credits of the Star Games final, a voiceover said the show . was coming from ‘Cambridge, a tranquil seat of learning.’ Harris . was announced by host Michael Aspel as captain of one of the celebrity . teams, which also included actors Colin Baker, Rula Lenska, Julian . Holloway and Robin Asquith. The Australian could be seen ‘jumping up and down like a kangaroo and mucking about amusingly’, Miss Wass said. She told Harris: ‘Michael Aspel seemed to know where he was because he introduced it as being on Jesus Green, Cambridge.’ Harris said: ‘That was the first time I had heard the word Cambridge. I had no idea. I don’t think any of us knew.’ He . told Miss Wass she ‘didn’t understand the showbiz scene’, saying he was . often driven from place to place without knowing the location. The . alleged victim had suggested the event had taken place in the centre of . Cambridge in about 1975 when she would have been 14. Footage shown in court today showed Rolf Harris taking part in the celebrity game show Star Games on ITV in 1978. The footage was released to the media today by the prosecution to show that his claim that he first visited Cambridge four years was a lie . Harris said in evidence he had not known where the show was filmed but was accused by barrister Sasha Wass of 'telling a deliberate lie' After the jury were shown a video of him in a game show in Cambridge in 1978, Harris claimed he had not realised the event had been held in the city . She told the court last month that she had been  working part-time to earn pocket money and was clearing up . when she saw  Harris entertaining crowds while pretending to be a dog. 'It was quite a funny scene to behold.' The woman, who is now 52, told the jury of six men and six women that Harris put his arm around her, and moved his hand up and down her back, before squeezing her bottom. With her voice wavering, she said: 'I can't remember the exact words but he made some motion to me 'come up', and I can see it in my mind's eye as clear as if it was happening now. He came up and put his arm around my left shoulder. 'It was quite a firm hold. I just stood there. I couldn't believe what was going on, this famous person putting his arm around me. 'To start it was a very nervous but a good feeling, however his hand then moved and his hand went up and down my back and his hand went over my bottom and it was very firm.' The woman said: 'I was too young to really understand the term but it was basically like groping. It was very firm and he squeezed it a few times. 'I was just completely frozen. I knew it was wrong. I couldn't move.' She said she was 'extremely embarrassed' and moved away as soon as Harris let go of her. The woman said she contacted the police after the revelations about Jimmy Savile in October 2012 and when it was publicly revealed that Harris had been arrested, because she wanted to back up any other alleged victims. Miss . Wass told Harris, who denies the assault: ‘The footage shows you . monkeying around pretending to be an animal – all of which fits the . description [the alleged victim] said she saw prior to being assaulted . by you. ‘You . have said categorically in this case that all the people who say they . had been sexually assaulted by you have lied. I’m going to suggest it is . you who is lying and that video demonstrates it. 'There . is no way you could have forgotten that event and you deliberately . tried to mislead the jury when you told them you had not visited . Cambridge until four years ago. That was a deliberate lie. ‘The film footage ... demonstrated it’s not the victims who have lied, it’s you who lied.’","Harris is also accused of assaulting another girl in Cambridge around 1975 .

"By . Richard Spillett . The daughter of Rolf Harris broke down yesterday as she described confronting her father about his affair with a teenager, telling him: ‘How could you? It’s my best friend.’ Bindi Nicholls said she went into a ‘head rush’ after hearing about the entertainer’s long-running relationship with her inseparable childhood playmate. ‘It was just horrible, It felt like the whole world had changed in an instant,’ she told Southwark Crown Court in London. Scroll down for video . Rolf Harris's daughter Bindi (left) said her father, Rolf (centre, with wife Alwen Hughes) could not have assaulted her teenage friend in the 1970s . ‘I immediately went into “My dad’s a . b******, my friend’s a saint” type of thing. I rang him up and said, . “What on earth has happened here, you have had an affair with my friend, . how dare you, how could you, it’s my best friend”. ‘I was just so angry with him... He said, “Sorry, sorry love, I’m so sorry”.’ She . later became suicidal and began hitting her head against a wall and . wanted to stab herself, the court heard. Taking the stand, Miss . Nicholls, 50, also told the court of her home life with the entertainer, . saying he ‘didn’t take much notice’ of her. And she told the jury how she feared the stress of the trial might kill her parents, who are in their 80s. Harris . is accused of subjecting his daughter’s friend to a 16-year campaign of . abuse which started when she was 13 while on holiday with his family in . Hawaii in 1978. The 84-year-old star denies molesting her, but says . they had a consensual relationship after she turned 18. Rolf Harris's daughter Bindi Nicholls (left), told the court of her shock when she heard of her father's affair with the woman in later life, but said the alleged victim did not mention any underage abuse . Miss . Nicholls told how she had known the alleged victim ‘from the moment I . was born’. ‘She was my absolute bestest friend in the world,’ she said. ‘I loved her to bits, we were inseparable.’ They remained friends as . adults and met at the Harris family home in Bray, Berkshire, soon after . Miss Nicholls had her son, Marlon, in 1996. During the get-together, . Miss Nicholls confided in her friend that she suspected Harris of an . affair with his ‘spiritual healer’ and housekeeper, Andi Kingston. But . she said she was ‘shocked’ by the response from her friend, who said: . ‘The bitch, the old cow, she is so ugly, what on earth does he see in . her? How dare he? What a s*** he is. Your dad is a right b******.’ Miss . Nicholls said: ‘I felt like she was in love with my dad, which is just . weird. It was like a light went off in my head and I said, “Have you . been seeing my dad?” and “Has something happened between you and my . dad?”, and she said, “Yes”.’ She added: ‘She said, “It has been going on since I was 18 or 19, Bindi, it has been going on for ages”.’ In . tears, Miss Nicholls said her friend even described how Harris . discussed with her how he could improve his relationship with his . daughter. ‘She said, “He took me out for dinner and all he wanted to . talk about was you and your relationship. I wanted him to talk about . me”.’ Miss Nicholls told the court she was so angry with her father . that before she left the family home she took photos of herself off the . wall and put them face down. Count 1: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on girl aged 15 . Count 2: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 .

Count 12: Indecent assault on fourth girl, 14, between 1/1/75 and 1/1/76 . The television presenter denies all counts. Jurors heard she was ‘absolutely . devastated’ by the news and became depressed after returning to her home . in Devon. She told the court: ‘How would you feel if your dad and . your best friend were having an affair? I was suicidal. It was only . Marlon that kept me going.’ Miss Nicholls denied that her friend had . told her that Harris had abused her since she was 13. Ms Nicholls said it was 'ridiculous' and 'laughable' for her childhood friend to claim Harris performed oral sex on her when she was 15 with Bindi asleep in the next bed. The friends last . met in 2004 but had an argument in which her friend hit her, Miss . Nicholls told the court. However, she said she had since worked things out with her father. ‘I . realised we are all human,’ she added. ‘I had him on a pedestal and now . I can see him as a father and a man.’ In cross-examination Sasha Wass . QC, said she had ‘colluded’ with Harris so that their evidence matched. She . replied: ‘This is not about me helping my father, this is about telling . the truth.’ She added: ‘I have been having counselling because it’s . really difficult being the daughter of a famous man and dealing with . that on your own is really difficult.’ Speaking of her childhood, Miss Nicholls said: ‘Dad didn’t really take much notice of me, or anyone for that matter, at home. ‘I . think when he is out in the world he wants to give everyone his time . and everyone is new and he can tell new jokes and new everything. ‘But when he is at home he is very much switched off, very quiet, quite often working, making something.’ Describing . the effect of the trial on her parents she said: ‘My parents are . 80-something, this is appalling for them. I have put my life on hold for . two years. I’m frightened they are going to die in the middle of this . court case. ‘Have you thought about how your parents might feel in . this sort of case?’ But Miss Wass shot back: ‘Have you given [the . alleged victim] any thought?’ Harris denies 12 counts of indecent . assault against four women aged between seven or eight and 19, over a . period of almost 20 years, between 1968 and 1986. The trial continues. Bindi Nicholls compared her famous father’s £11million fortune to ‘winning the lottery’, the court heard yesterday. She sent Harris an email in July 2012 asking what he wanted to do with his estate and ‘dreaming about the things you could do’, jurors were told. Miss Nicholls, who denied being ‘financially dependent’ on Harris but admitted he gives her a ‘monthly income’, said the letter was taken out of context. She said: ‘My dad is very vague about money and I would like to feel a bit more understanding about what he wants and what mum wants and what I can do for them in their old age.’","Harris is accused of molesting 13-year-old friend of his daughter Bindi .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Anthony Armstrong died in 2011 after being recruited by his father, Alan Armstrong, to attack his rival . A Melbourne father who recruited his son to bash a rival will be forever haunted after the 24-year-old died doing what his dad asked, a judge has said. Alan Armstrong, 63, was sentenced to a 12 month jail term, wholly suspended for 12 months on Monday for inciting his son, Anthony Armstrong, to intentionally commit serious injury. 'Alan Armstrong did something that will haunt him for the rest of his life,' Victorian Supreme Court Justice Michael Croucher said. 'Anthony Armstrong died doing as his father asked.' Anthony led a trio of thugs who burst into the backyard of Stephen Delmo's Somerville home, beating him with a baseball bat and brandishing a shotgun. Charged with the task by his father, Anthony called for the gun as Mr Delmo lay beaten on the ground. But as he collected the firearm it discharged twice, hitting him in the chest. There was simmering tension between Stephen Delmo and Alan Armstrong and the judge heard that 'a good deal of ill-feeling' had brewed between the pair for some time. The animosity is understood to have stemmed from a personal dispute between Alan Armstrong's friend Debbie Wright and Stephen Delmo. 'The evidence is that many other persons also disliked Mr Delmo because of his conduct,' the judgement reads. Alan Armstrong held an intervention order against Stephen Delmo at the time he told his son to 'bash' the man. Justice Croucher said 24-year-old Anthony was directing the attack and was the ultimate architect of his own sad demise. He died of two shotgun wounds to the chest when the firearm accidentally discharged while he was beating Stephen Delmo in his own home with a baseball bat . Alan Armstrong, 63, was sentenced to wholly suspended jail term of 12 months on Monday due to the judge saying he would be haunted for the rest of his life by his own actions . 'He called for the gun, a gun he must've known was loaded, while in the throes of belting Mr Delmo with a baseball bat in the dark,' he said on Monday. 'Anthony Armstrong was complicit in the behaviour that caused his own death.' Alan Armstrong, from the suburb of Hastings, had recruited his fresh-out-of-prison son to settle a score with Mr Delmo. Accomplices in the attack, Tyson John Haver and Michael Scott Wald, raced Anthony Armstrong to the Frankston hospital after the December 2011 incident where they dumped his body before screaming for help and fleeing. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Michael Croucher said: 'Anthony Armstrong was complicit in the behaviour that caused his own death' Anthony's accomplices in the attack, Tyson John Haver and Michael Scott Wald, were convicted of manslaughter after they dumped his body at Frankston hospital before fleeing . Haver, 31, and Wald, 29, were both convicted of manslaughter and recklessly causing serious injury to Mr Delmo. Haver, of Carrum Downs, was jailed for eight years and six months with a minimum five years and six months. Wald was jailed for nine years with a minimum six years. Haver's partner, 31-year-old Adalia Ottobre of Carrum Downs, was sentenced to eight-months imprisonment, wholly suspended, for being an accessory after the fact to recklessly causing serious injury. Family and friends of Armstrong yelled abuse after the sentencing with one man saying 'nine years for murder, not good enough' and a woman telling reporters 'no one has the right to take someone else's life and get nine years for it'.

"By . Louise Cheer . Victoria's Environment Protection Agency had no previous cases to base its response to maintain air-quality as a six-week fire ravaged the Hazelwood underground brown coal mine in a world-first. The inquiry into the devastating coal mine fire is into its second week. Morwell - the town near the mine - was covered in smoke and ash for 45 days as the fire burned, with residents reporting headaches, nose bleeds and ash blanketing their homes like snow. The Hazelwood coal mine fire started on February 9 and burned for six weeks . The fire burned for six weeks, with residents reporting ill-health from the fumes . The flames created a seemingly flowing wave of fire . Some residents were told to evacuate their homes. On Monday, the inquiry heard Victoria's Environment Protection Agency was ill-informed about how to respond to the mine fire, AAP reported. The agency was called two days after the fire started in the open-cut brown coal mine on February 11. Chief executive at the time of the fire John Merritt said the agency had never been called to mine fires and was not an emergency air-monitoring agency. Smoke and ash from the fire hung over the town of Morwell for 45 days, and residents reported headaches and nosebleeds . Victoria's Environment Protection Agency said it did not have anything to base its response to the air quality because the situation was a world first . 'It was simply without precedent that we would have this sort of event of this sort of duration ... that would warrant the emergency readiness of mobile air-monitoring equipment,' he said. Mr Merritt went on to tell the inquiry that the EPA started transmitting data from a 24-hour reading on February 14. But counsel assisting the inquiry Melinda Richards said there was a week-long gap between air quality data recorded at East Morwell on February 12 and data recorded at Morwell South - where conditions were reported to be more severe. The agency was called two days after the fire started in the open-cut brown coal mine on February 11 . The inquiry into the Hazelwood fire is into its second week and the final report will be handed down at the end of August . Mr Merritt indicated the brown coal mine fire burning for so long was a world first and the EPA had nowhere to draw experience from after the Victorian Government's lawyer Josh Wilson asked him if this was the case. 'For all the wrong reasons this particular mine fire was a world's first in terms of prolonged adverse air quality,"" Mr Wilson said. Mr Merritt agreed and said 'Previous fires had led us into a false sense of the impact of a mine fire on the town.' He said there was no historical basis before February 9 to indicate it would have been useful to have air-monitoring labs on hand. Country Fire Authority firefighters have told the inquiry that when they arrived they were locked out of the site . Mr Merritt also added the agency responded as quickly as it could. 'I don't believe we could have acted any faster than we did,' he said. The inquiry has also heard efforts to stop the fire were marred with communication issues. On Thursday, volunteer firefighter Doug Steley told the inquiry Country Fire Authority (CFA) crews had trouble getting into the Hazelwood mine when they first arrived because the gate was locked, and weren't told where to go and weren't given proper information on how to operate carbon monoxide monitors. 7,000 people were looked at for carbon monoxide poisoning in relation to the fire, with 23 WorkCover claims filed . During the fire, some residents in the town of Morwell - that has about 125,000 people - were evacuated . The Herald Sun reported the inquiry heard the fire's health monitoring was the largest of its kind in the world - with 7,000 people looked at for carbon monoxide poisoning and 23 WorkCover claims were filed. There were 14 firefighters who were taken to hospital with carbon monoxide poisoning while they battled the fire. It also heard the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning from mine fires was known after an incident in 2006, but the Country Fire Authority had not yet put into place a 2010 draft operating procedure when the Hazelwood fire started. The inquiry into the coal mine fire started on May 26 and will focus on its origin and the response effort. The final report will be submitted to the Victorian Government at the end of August.","EPA had no previous cases for reference to protect town's air quality .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Detectives are confident of finally identifying the man whose decapitated, burnt torso was found in Gympie in September of last year. The new hope has come after tests revealed that the victim, whose body was discovered on the side of Cedar Pocket Rd, was taking both the hypertension drug Irbesartan and Quinine. Police have since obtained a list of people known to have been taking similar medication and have begun conducting doorknocks of the individuals. Scroll down for video . Unsolved mystery: A torso, found on Cedar Pocket Rd, pictured, in September 2013, could be identified now that police have found the the hypertension drug Irbesartan and Quinine in the body's system . 'We are working our way through the Queenslanders first. A breakthrough could come from the next door we knock on,' Detective Inspector Bruce McNab told The Courier-Mail. Information from Crime Stoppers obtained by police in the last fortnight regarding a number of people missing people, is also considered hopeful for the investigation. The man is believed to be caucasian, aged between 40 and 80 and between 180cm and 190cm tall. He was of a solid build with a large frame and chest but not overweight. Police believed he was involved in difficult manual labour due to spurs, called osteophytes, on his backbone. They maintain that the head found 45 kilometres away in a tree plantation about 1km off Cooloola Coast Rd on April 11, is not linked to the torso. The grim discovery of the torso left Gympie, with a population of about 18,000, horrified when it was found burning on the side of the road. Clues: A burnt towel was found near the the burning torso . The torso was decapitated above the collarbone and below the rib cage and had its hands gruesomely hacked off at the wrist. Tests indicated the torso belonged to an athletic man, who was taking medication for high blood pressure, malaria, cramps and restless leg syndrome. There were no tattoos on his upper chest and there was no match on the DNA database, which means he had no criminal history. The torso revealed a 3cm scar on the right side of the man's back, about halfway down, from an old injury. Cadaver dogs were also been used as part of police investigations. With the mystery baffling Queensland police, the FBI and international forensic experts are being used to help solve the case. Insp McNab said items of interest had been discovered in the search of Toolara State Forest, but could not reveal what they were. 'We have found some other items of interest during the search we have done of the area and we are still searching there,' he said. 'We are not able to say what those items are.' Call for help: Queensland police are asking for public assistance with the ongoing investigations . The charred towel found near the torso was wrapped in tarp-like material. A plain-coloured T-shirt was also found. Police are looking for a female suspect, described as small to medium build, middle aged, with blonde to brown shoulder-length hair. It is believed she was wearing black exercise pants to her knee and driving an orange to brown hatchback. Sighted in the Gympie area for about an hour on the night of September 19, the woman was seen at her car on the side of Cedar Creek Rd, outside the town's centre. The woman was also seen leaning over a grass area near the road's edge but kept her head down, with her back to the road. At 6.30pm, shortly after she left the area, passing motorists saw a fire at the same grass area. The fire revealed a burning torso, which had been doused in an ­accelerant and set alight.

"By . Daniel Mills . Federal Government politicians will still be allowed to keep staff related to them employed, after legal advice ruled a decision by Tony Abbott for them to be sacked was unlawful. In November, Mr Abbott brought in tougher legislation to prevent MPs taking advantage of tax-funded entitlements, such as nepotism in the workplace, instructing them to sack their wives, in-laws and children. But the announcement and its immediate introduction sparked a revolt from both sides of the political chamber, with Liberal and Labor MPs defending the employment of their relatives based on their competency and experience. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has relaxed the laws on MP entitlements, including a decision to allow relatives of politicians to continue working for them . Faced with legal advice that the relatives would have a strong case to sue for unlawful dismissal, the government has now relaxed the law and agreed to let those who where employed before January stay. Any wife, child or in-law employed since, however, will not be entitled to remain in full time employment. Liberal Senator Ian Macdonald, whose wife has worked in his Canberra office for 24 years, told the Courier Mail he had given the Prime Minister a serving over the decision. More...

'She’s going to continue to do that because I need her.' He is just one of 14 MPs in similar situations who have had a hand in decrying Prime Minister Abbott's edict. The new rules would have also forced West Australian Liberal MP Don Randall, who was caught up in the entitlements saga, to sack his daughter Tess and WA Labor Senator Glenn Sterle said he had no intention of sacking his wife, Fiona. Tony Abbott's daughter Frances received a scholarship to a prestigious school, leading many to think it was the result of a gesture from one friend to another . 'I won't be sacking any of my staff,'' he said. Even the politician responsible for policing the new rule, Special Minister of State Michael Ronaldson, previously employed his son Jack. Meanwhile, the decision to relax the law comes just a week after the PM came under fire for his daughter Frances Abbott's $60,000 scholarship at a prestigious arts school, awarded by a long-time friend of Mr Abbott. Ms Abbott, 22, accepted a 'chairman's scholarship' for her Bachelor of Design course from the Whitehouse Institute of Design, where Liberal supporter Les Taylor sits as chairman on the board of governors. Mr Abbott has known the Institute's chairman Mr Taylor for many years, the Prime Minister's office said, but a spokesperson for Mr Abbott said he did not need to declare it  on his pecuniary register because it was not considered a gift. Under the statement of Registrable Interests, a scholarship is not a gift it is an award based on merit and disclosure is not required,' the spokesperson said.","Tony Abbott declared MPs sack wives, in-laws and children .

"By . Louise Cheer . Talk about a quick sale! In what might be a new record for an Australian development, a new building in Bondi Junction had sold all its 129 apartments within four hours of going on sale on Saturday - and for an average of about $1million each. The ink dried on the last contract for Aqua just after midday, with  Colliers International reaping in more than $130million in sales on launch day. The highest-priced seller was a top-floor, three-bedroom apartment which sold for $2,165,000 and boasts views of the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House. Scroll down for video . The high-demand apartments reflect Leighton Properties' focus on inner-ring urban renewal sites in prime locations, close to transport links, retail and places of work . Apartments facing north-west take in the Harbour Bridge, Opera House and the city skyline, while north-east-facing apartments have coastal views . Muir and Nicole Mathison - who were first in line at the launch day - bought a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with a study on the 18th floor. It boasts a harbour view and cost $16,500 per square metre. The couple registered their interest in September because they 'saw the colour image of the building and loved the architecture' and saw the location of the apartment as an advantage, having sold their car two years ago. 'We worked out it saved each of us about $5000 a year - and Bondi Junction is so central to everything that it makes getting around easy,' Ms Mathison said. 'We're close to restaurants, shopping and transport, and we expect more and more cafes and eateries to pop up over time.' Ms Mathison, who was born in Bondi, said the purchase was even more meaningful. Her mother purchased her wedding dress from a store on the site that Aqua is built on. On the lower end of the scale, a one-bedroom apartment was $585,000, followed by a two-bedroom apartment for $915,000 and a three-bedroom apartment for $2,095,000. Aqua is the third project Leighton Properties and Qualitas have collaborated on and proved to be the design duo's most popular with more than 2000 registrations of interests in the apartments. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the Bondi Junction apartments were designed by KANNFINCH and DC8 Studio with two sleek towers joined by a garden podium and topped off with rooftop gardens. Apartments facing north-east have coastal views and those facing north-west look out on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Opera House and the city. The interiors of the luxury apartments draw from Aqua's near-beach location with kitchen islands shaped like surfboards or waves, and white- or grey-wash timber floors thanks to the creative eye of the award-winning Koichi Takada Architects. Leighton Properties' national head of residential Gavin Tonnet said the quick sale reflected their 'focus on inner-ring urban renewal sites in prime locations, close to transport links, retail and places of work'. He also cited the company's other successes Erskineville's Erko where all 41 of its East at Erko apartments sold out in 75 minutes on the release's launch day. Colliers International general manager of residential David Chittenden said the success of other Bondi Junction developments as well as Aqua's show the high demand of similar projects. Qualitas' chief executive officer Andrew Schwartz believes the overwhelming response for Aqua could be credited to its location, views and design. Saturday also saw a lot of buyers around the upper north shore of Sydney keen to buy up at Lindfield's Crimson Hill development. At its launch of the Canopy Release, 84 per cent of apartments were sold off the plan. The big draw card for potential owners at Crimson Hill is the close proximity of the location to Chatswood and the train line. The Canopy Release for the Dunstan Grove precinct saw prices start at $550,000 for a one-bedroom apartment, a two-bedroom one for $650,000 and a three-bedder going from $860,000. Only 20 apartments are available at the development's next release in 2015. The 345-residence project is backed by Defence Housing Australia and shares a boundary line with Lane Cove National Park. DHA managing director Peter Howman said he was pleased to see so much interest in the development. 'These are great results – it clearly shows we have entered the market at the right price point and with a product buyers are after,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. Saturday saw a bumper day of real estate sales for Sydney, with almost 900 properties going under the hammer. One of interest was a house in Goodsir Street, Rozelle - where two brothers were murdered in 2009 and was bought for $200,000 above its reserve price by a Byron Bay buyer. They were on the phone and were represented at the auction by a BresicWhitney agent. The house is now worth $2,265,000 five years after the cold-blooded attack on Albert and Mario Frisoli. It was a slow start to an opening bid of $1.9million, but three registered bidders took the result well past the $2.05million reserve at the on-site auction. Recently renovated, the Rozelle address includes separate living areas, cathedral ceilings, timber floors, alfresco dining and a self-contained studio at the back. The interiors of the stunning apartments were overseen by Koichi Takada Architects who put in white- or grey-wash timber floors . One-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments were available, with the top-floor apartment selling for more than $2.1 million . Award-winning Koichi Takada Architects took inspiration from the apartment block's beach location and installed kitchen islands shaped like a surfboards or waves . Aqua is the third residential development collaboration between Leighton Properties and Qualitas and all 129 apartments sold out in four hours .

"By . Daniel Mills . A mother of four says her family has eaten their last McDonald's meal ever after her youngest, a five-year-old boy, was served a six pack of raw chicken nuggets. The restaurant, just a two minute walk from the Luke family home in Woonona, on the NSW south coast, served Tracy Luke a portion of raw poultry which was to be eaten by her five-year-old, Riley. It was one serving of a bigger order that the family picked up for dinner last Wednesday. 'I left the meal with the boys at home and went to pick up my own dinner, I said 'I'll only be two minutes.' But when she returned she noticed the boys surveying the uncooked dish of battered pink meat, she yelled out: 'Don't eat that!' Raw Deal: Tracey Luke and her five-year-old son Riley . Culprit: The Woonona McDonald's is being investigated following the Luke family's complaint . She told MailOnline what looked like a crispy, golden peice of poultry goodness from the outside was actually a death trap inside. She said: 'How can they sell this?!' She said Riley was lucky to have only eaten half of a nugget before she told her sons to put the box away. More... Is obesity contagious? Virus that causes same symptoms as common cold is linked to weight gain . 'MasterChef turned me into a basket case': Former contestant of cooking show Jules Allen says she was encouraged to 'crack open for the cameras' 'I thought this could kill someone.' But perhaps the most incredible reaction, Mrs Luke said, was the one reserved for the store manager when she went back to the McDonald's behind the family home to alert them of her complaint. 'The manager just said 'oh sorry ... we've had another complaint about that.' 'They just threw the nuggets in the bin and said 'sorry' before getting a peice of paper and taking down some details.' Foul: The inside of the nuggets served to Mrs Luke last Wednesday night. She has since heard from a McDonald's area manager, who incredibly, has offered the family 'vouchers' to eat at the restaurant. 'What good is that to us? We aren't going to go back there.' A McDonalds spokeswoman told the Illawarra Mercury the company was investigating. 'We are disappointed that this has happened,' she said. 'We are currently investigating this with the restaurant and liaising with the customer directly.' Uncooked chicken is naturally contaminated with bacteria including salmonella, listeria and campylobacter, which can cause food poisoning. A spokeswoman for the Food Safety Information Council said to be considered eatable, chicken needs to be cooked at temperatures of at least 75 degrees in the centre, to kill the bacteria. She said: 'People shouldn't consume chicken if it appears uncooked,' she said. 'There are an estimated 5.4 million cases of food poisoning in Australia each year.'","Tracy Luke said she was livid over raw meat and handling of complaint .

"By . Sally Lee . and Adam Duggan . A government investigation has exposed Australia's biggest welfare scammers in a long-running crackdown that recovered more than a billion dollars in payments last year, with more expected in 2014. The scammers have been caught red-handed in footage shown on A Current Affair. But there's more to come, and each will now face the legal consequences of their actions, warns the Department of Human Services. Scroll down for video . Richard Bruce, who was on a disability pension, is pictured at the golf club practising his swing . A 50-year-old woman is caught withdrawing her mother's pension long after she died . One in four Australian families now receive some form of welfare. With dozens of benefits available and billions of dollars being handed out, some are claiming welfare they're not entitled to. While it may just be a few hundred dollars a week - that money can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars being scammed from taxpayers. In 2013, the Australian Government spent $132 billion on welfare - that's $250,000 every minute. A couple who claimed single parent allowances. These kind of family support payments are the most rorted welfare payment, according to the Department of Human Services . Treasurer Joe Hockey warned, when handing down his first Federal Budget, that the government 'cannot maintain current levels of expenditure' - making it more important than ever to crack down on those defrauding Centrelink. With the help of new technology, Human Services workers are starting to catch these rorters on camera. Last year, Centrelink recovered $1.15 billion worth of outstanding debts and investigated 3,200 people. Of the money recovered and those investigated, $39 million were fraudulent claims and 1,200 were prosecuted. Centrelink version 2.0: The Department of Human Services is using sophisticated new technology to investigate those they believe are rorting the welfare system . In one instance, a 43-year-old was jailed for claiming parenting payments under a false identity. Another example is Richard Bruce, who was among the 800,000 Australians on a disability pension, claiming he was too sick to work. But while he was claiming disability benefits, he was practising his swing down at the golf club. But what's worse is people claiming the benefits of deceased relatives. Claiming her dead sister's welfare payments: This woman netted $177,000 in fraudulent welfare payments over 20 years . One 50-year-old woman continued to withdraw her deceased mother's Age Pension, long after she had died. Another woman claimed the benefits of her dead sister for 20 years - stealing $177,000 from Australian taxpayers. 'Those cases where people continue to receive payment of deceased relatives are pretty low acts to be honest with you,' Department of Human Services General Manager Hank Jongen admits. 'They demonstrate to us that someone has deliberately set out to rip off the taxpayer.' Unable to maintain current spending: With Treasurer Joe Hockey admitting when handing down the Federal Budget that his government is unable to maintain current levels of spending, Department of Human Services head Hank Jongen will become quite the ally in cracking down on welfare fraud . Sydney Uniting Church minister Reverend Bill Crews, who hosts a weekly program on radio station 2GB and founded youth-services charity the Exodus Foundation, said he believes some people are rorting the system out of sheer desperation. 'You're trying to live on a welfare benefit and you're struggling and you're behind and you owe money everywhere and you have a credit card and it's maxed out and you've borrowed all the money from Centrelink and somehow two or three hundred dollars falls in your lap what are you going to do?' he asked. But his view isn't shared by all. Melbourne radio broadcaster Neil Mitchell says he was furious to learn of the scams - and has no sympathy for those scamming the system. 'It's selfish, it's greedy, it's fraudulent,' Mr Mitchell said.","The Department of Human Services is cracking down on Australians who lie and claim welfare benefits they're not entitled to receive .
Some have been rorting the system by declaring they're a pensioner, a single parent, have a disability or are unable to find a job .
Over a billion dollars of debt was recovered by Centrelink last year and 3,200 people were investigated for fraud - 1,200 of which were prosecuted ."
