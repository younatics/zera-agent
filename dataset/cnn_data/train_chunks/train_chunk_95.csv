"(CNN) -- Gael Clichy has become Manchester City's first signing of the transfer window after the French international defender completed his switch from Arsenal. Clichy, 25, will cost Roberto Mancini's side $11.2 million and has signed a four-year contract at the City of Manchester Stadium. The former Cannes left-back spent eight years with Arsenal and becomes the final member of Arsenal's ""invincibles"" -- the team of 2003/04 who won the English Premier League without losing a game -- to leave the Emirates Stadium. ""I'm really happy to be joining such a great club,"" Clichy told Manchester City's official web site. ""I hope I can add to the quality we already have here because we have a fantastic squad who I believe will continue to get better.

"(CNN) -- The case against Joran Van der Sloot, who is suspected of killing a woman in a Peruvian hotel, was headed to the prosecutor's office on Wednesday. Van der Sloot and his new private defense attorney were in court on Tuesday for a preliminary hearing. The hearing was held behind closed doors at the Castro Castro prison outside of Lima. No cameras were allowed. The hearing was postponed last week because Van der Sloot did not have legal representation. Van der Sloot was once the prime suspect in the disappearance in Aruba of American teenager Natalee Holloway, who vanished at age 18 while on a graduation trip. He was arrested twice but never charged in connection with her disappearance. He was arrested in May 2010 following the death of Stephany Flores. Formal charges could take up to two months to be filed, depending on the backlog. Once charges are filed against him, a three-judge panel will set the date for a trial to begin. ""For the Van der Sloot case, we may be looking at five to seven sessions for the oral proceedings, one session per week approximately,"" said Giovanna Gismondi, an expert on the Peruvian criminal legal system now teaching international relations at the University of Oklahoma. Last week, Ricardo Flores described the first time he saw the alleged killer of his daughter face to face. ""It was a very tough moment,"" he told CNN June 8 shortly after leaving a courtroom inside the prison, noting that it seemed Van der Sloot was enjoying many privileges. ""I thought I'd see someone skinny ... but no, he was fatter than when he first went to prison."" His daughter was found dead in a Lima hotel room registered to Van der Sloot in May 2010. Police say Van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Earlier this month, Van der Sloot's defense attorney, Maximo Altez, resigned, citing differences in strategy. In Session's Mayra Cuevas and CNN en Espanol's Patricia Janiot contributed to this report.","NEW: The prosecutor has the case; it could be two months before formal charges are filed .

"(CNN) -- A French boat trying to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza is ""stuck"" in Greece, detained along with its crew by Greek authorities, a spokesman for the French crew said Thursday. The ship and crew were stopped when they arrived in Crete to refuel, said Maxime Gimberteau of ""A Boat for Gaza."" Greek authorities confirmed that the boat, Dignite Al Karama, had been docked at the port of Sitia in Crete since early Thursday. They said it would not be given permission to depart for Gaza, and that it was not clear what would happen next. ""Authorities are following the necessary legal procedures,"" including ""checking the identities of the passengers"" and ""the ship's documents,"" said Greek coast guard head of press Elias Sambatakakis. Sambatakakis said there had been ""full co-operation between the authorities and those on board."" ""It is not yet clear what will happen once procedures are completed,"" he said. ""Obviously if the ship asks for permission to go to Gaza, this will be declined."" The French yacht had been the last boat in international waters of a flotilla of 10 ships trying to get to Gaza. Greek authorities have been stopping ships, including the American boat The Audacity of Hope, from leaving Greek waters for Gaza. Israel insists on controlling access to Gaza because it says it has to keep weapons out of the hands of Palestinian militants who would use them to attack Israelis. Gaza is run by Hamas, which has carried out dozens of terrorist attacks and is listed by the United States as a terrorist organization. Israel emphasizes that it delivers large amounts of aid to Gaza. The country mounted a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail. CNN's Elinda Labropoulou and France Costrel contributed to this report.","The Dignite Al Karama is trying to break Israel's blockade of Gaza .

"(CNN) -- Six children ages 1 to 7 have been hospitalized for severe gastrointestinal illnesses after swimming this month in an Alabama indoor water park, a state health official said Friday. The children got sick after visiting the Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatic Center between June 12-18, said Dr. Mary McIntyre, medical officer of the Bureau of Communicable Disease at the Alabama Department of Public Health. The indoor splash park was closed Friday but the park's other facilities remained open, a park official said. Environmental officials will test chemical levels before the splash park will re-open, according to McIntyre. ""We are continuing to work with the medical community to identify the extent of the problem,"" she said. Five of the children have been transferred from East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika to the Children's Hospital of Alabama in Birmingham, where they were being treated with antibiotics, the official said. In a statement, the department of public health urged parents whose children who may have visited the park to contact the health department if they suffer symptoms of nausea, vomiting or severe diarrhea. Seven day-care centers took children to the Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatic Center for a day camp during the time frame officials have identified as when the water may have been contaminated, the health department said. ""We're recommending any children who did attend the splash park, until we can determine the full extent of the infection, not to swim in inflatable pools,"" McIntyre said. She added that such swimming could risk exposing other children to the bacteria. Illnesses linked to pools are commonly caused by germs spread through contact with contaminated water, the department said in a news release. E. coli infections are caused by bacteria that can be found in foods and stool. Children often become infected after being exposed to others who are not toilet-trained. ""It's not uncommon for recreational water illnesses to occur, particularly in the summer, because a lot of people are in the pools,"" McIntyre said. ""Children have a tendency to swallow water which is probably why we're seeing it in a younger group."" The health department warns people not to swim if they have diarrhea; to avoid swallowing pool or lake water; and to shower with soap before swimming so that germs and bacteria do not end up in pool water.","The 6 sickened Alabama children all visited Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatic Center between June 12-18 .

"Aboard The Uss Wasp (CNN) -- -- Even before Hurricane Irene started thrashing the U.S. East Coast, the Navy prepared for what it could do if the disaster was even more catastrophic than it proved to be. As Irene strengthened and bore down on the United States, the Navy ordered 27 warships to sail out of its massive naval station in Norfolk, Virginia. Another 11 ships, already at sea on various duties, were told to stay out. ""Our first mission was to sortie the fleet and keep the fleet safe,"" said Capt. Brenda Holdener, commander of the USS Wasp, one of the ships that left Norfolk. Like Air Force bases that fly their planes west, moving ships to sea has become standard operating procedure for the Navy when major hurricanes approach. ""Ships are safer at sea than than are in port during a hurricane or heavy weather,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Timothy Reiswig, navigator of the Wasp. But when the Wasp, an amphibious assault ship, headed out of Norfolk, steering clear of Irene was just its first objective. The ship was also prepared to respond with a wide array of equipment and people to the hurricane zone if civilian officials asked for help. ""Over the years we've had so many hurricanes that devastate this country, you know we kinda get primed for being ready and responsive to it,"" said Rear Adm. Kevin Scott, commander of Amphibious Task Force 26, a unit that was created to be more prepared for hurricane response than any other Navy unit. ""What you are seeing is lessons learned from what has happened over the past few years, and realizing that the response that's required for a major catastrophe -- you know like Hurricane Katrina and Rita -- requires all the resources that the nation has to bear,"" Scott said. Those resources were focused on the Wasp, one of America's largest amphibious ships. The ship has a full-sized flight deck, capable of launching heavy-lift or search and rescue helicopters, and a dock inside its stern, capable of carrying and launching two huge landing craft. Those boats can move from inside the hull of the Wasp to just about any beach and unload some 160 tons of equipment, supplies or personnel. And not all the help has to go to shore. The Wasp, which normally carries Marines into combat, has a huge hospital deck. ""We have three operating rooms. We can expand to four. We have 15 ICU beds that you can see here, each one with it's own equipment, which is exactly what you would find in a normal ICU,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Juan Dapena, a doctor who is the senior medical officer on the Wasp. Dapena's regular medical staff was augmented by a surgical team that was prepared to go ashore to help with any medical emergencies. The ship also brought a group of Seabees, Navy engineers who are trained in disaster response. They brought along chainsaws, water pumps -- even a bulldozer. But putting this vast capacity of disaster aid to use depends on a twist of federal law. States can and did mobilize thousands of National Guard troops to help victims of Irene. But the Navy sailors involved in Amphibious Task Force 26 are active-duty military, and they can't just find a crisis and start helping. Under a system called Defense Support of Civilian Authorities, local officials who want help have to ask the federal government for it. The president would then issue an order to the military, which would trickle down the chain of command before the Wasp and other ships in the task force could go to work. This time, as bad as Irene was, state and local officials, as well as non-military federal agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, were able to respond without calling in the Navy. But Scott thinks even though his task force focused on practice training, that what he saw while at sea for the past week is evidence the Navy is better prepared than ever. ""Over the years we've just gotten better and better at it and poised to respond,"" Scott said. But to prove that the Navy has gotten better, that would likely require a disaster like Irene ... only worse.","The USS Wasp is one of America's largest amphibious ships .

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney scored a hat-trick as champions Manchester United retained their 100% English Premier League record this season with a remarkable 8-2 thumping of injury-hit Arsenal at Old Trafford. United dominated the Gunners who suffered their worst ever Premier League defeat. With Manchester City winning 5-1 at Tottenham also on Sunday, it proved a superb day for the two Manchester clubs, who are level at the top with a maximum nine points from their three games. What now for Arsenal and Fabregas? In contrast, north London rivals Tottenham and Arsenal are struggling at the other end of the table, with Tottenham at the bottom without a point and Arsenal fourth from bottom with just one point. Arsenal, who sold star players Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri this month, were always struggling to cope with the home side once Danny Welbeck headed United into the lead following hesitancy in the defense. And Arsenal then wasted a golden chance to level when captain Robin Van Persie's penalty was saved by United keeper David De Gea after Jonny Evans pulled back Theo Walcott. United soon made them pay when Ashley Young curled home a superb second before Rooney's brilliant free-kick made it 3-0. Walcott pulled a goal back for Arsenal just before half-time from an acute angle, but United restored their advantage with another trademark Rooney free-kick in the 64th minute. By now, United were running riot, and Nani made it 5-1 after being left free in the penalty area to clip the ball into the net. Substitute Park Ji-Sung added a sixth before Van Persie scored from close range to make it 6-2. Arsenal then had defender Carl Jenkinson sent off for a second yellow card -- meaning the club have had a player dismissed in each of their first three matches. And soon after, Rooney completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after Walcott's foul on Nani. The humiliation was completed when Young matched his first-half strike with another superb effort in injury time. The defeat, the first time Arsenal had conceded eight goals in a league game since 1896, increased the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger, with new signings expected to arrive before the deadline for trades on Wednesday. ""Of course it hurts, it's humiliating, but you could see that we had not recovered physically in the second half from Wednesday night's win over Udinese,"" Wenger told the official Arsenal website. ""We were short in some areas, that is for sure. They have class and they punished us. It was 3-1 at half-time and I think that was harsh against us. ""We missed a penalty, we had a chance to get back to 3-2. We tried desperately to get back but we opened ourselves up and were punished. Their finishing was great today,"" added the Frenchman. United's performance was matched by the dazzling display of big-spending rivals Manchester City, with Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko scoring four goals in their rout of Tottenham at White Hart Lane. With Frenchman Nasri in fine form on his debut following his move from Arsenal, City were too strong for Spurs, and they went ahead in the 34th minute when Dzeko scored from Nasri's cross. And the duo combined again seven minutes later when Dzeko scored with a clever back-header from Nasri's cross. Dzeko completed his hat-trick early in the second half when he tapped in Yaya Toure's cutback. The home side pulled a goal back when Younes Kaboul headed in Rafael van der Vaart's corner. But Sergio Aguero soon restored the three-goal advantage with a brilliant drive from outside the penalty area. And Dzeko curled home his fourth and Manchester City's fifth in injury time. The result leaves Harry Redknapp's side without a point along with Blackburn and West Bromwich Albion, who suffered their third straight defeat 1-0 at home to Stoke Sunday. In Sunday's other Premier League match, Newcastle beat Fulham 2-1 at home with two goals from striker Leon Best.","Wayne Rooney scores a hat-trick as Manchester United thrash Arsenal 8-2 .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of children called for freedom, held anti-government signs and criticized President Bashar al-Assad in at least two Syrian cities on Sunday, a day before al-Assad planned to make another speech to the unsettled nation. In a video posted on YouTube, showing a demonstration the cameraman claims took place Sunday in the Damascus suburb of Kaboon, dozens of mostly young people walk down a street brandishing signs, chanting and in some cases wearing party hats with messages on them. They are joined by a handful of adults, including one man who puts a boy on his shoulders as they march. Another YouTube video, purportedly from the coastal city of Latakia, shows a group of young boys clapping and voicing anti-government sentiments. One boy leads the chants, with no adults visible. The repeated phrases range from the patriotic ""Long live Syria"" to others targeting Syria's leader with slogans like ""Bashar al-Assad go away"" and ""The people need the fall of the regime."" Middle East, North Africa: Unrest country by country . An opposition activist, who spoke to CNN from Syria on condition of anonymity, said that such demonstrations have become a daily ritual in the Middle Eastern country, with children embracing their parents' politics and following their lead in voicing their views publicly. Parents and teachers are often nearby in these protests, which typically happen in neighborhoods near homes or schools, the activist claimed. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of videos. The network has not been allowed into Syria to cover the unrest and draws from social media and interviews with witnesses on the ground there to inform its reporting. There was no indication of violence Sunday, unlike what's been reported during dozens of other protests that have erupted since the mid-March arrest of teens for writing anti-government graffiti in Daraa. More than 1,100 people may have died in subsequent unrest across Syria, according to the human rights activist group Amnesty International. Critics have accused forces loyal to al-Assad of targeting defenseless demonstrators and hindering outside help for those in need. The Syrian government has consistently blamed the protest casualties on ""armed gangs."" Al-Assad on Monday afternoon will deliver his third speech in recent months about the situation in Syria, according to the official SANA news agency. International pressure against the Damascus government has steadily grown, with calls from political leaders in the United States, Europe and elsewhere criticizing the perceived government clampdown on demonstrators. Beatrice Megevand-Roggo, the Red Cross' director for the Near East and Middle East, said in an interview posted last month on the group's website that a lack of information and access has greatly hindered humanitarian assistance to Syria. The head of her group, International Committee of the Red Cross President Jakob Kellenberger, will arrive in the Syrian capital on Sunday night, the organization announced via Twitter. He plans to ""discuss the humanitarian situation"" and the role of the Red Cross with Syrian authorities, the nonprofit group said. Kellenberger's visit comes two days after another high-profile activist -- actress and U.N. goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie -- met with Syrian refugees in Turkey and drew attention to the anguish faced by families affected by the violence and reported government crackdown. The Turkish government said Saturday more than 10,100 Syrians have crossed the border. About 3,000 more were huddled on the Syrian border near Badama, eyewitness Jameel Saib told CNN Saturday. The refugees that Jolie visited are living in four camps managed by Turkey and the Turkish Red Crescent, reports the U.N.'s refugee agency. ""The people in this camp have fled in fear for their lives, and many told me they were distraught about the safety of loved ones still in Syria,"" Jolie said, according to the U.N. group. CNN's Kamal Ghattas contributed to this report.","NEW: Videos show children in two cities apparently protesting against Syria's government .

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- Demonstrators took to the streets Friday after Muslim prayers, as they have on past Fridays in recent weeks in a number of Syrian cities, resulting in 10 deaths, according to an activist group. ""The people want to overthrow the regime,"" was the chant of the demonstrators in the cities of Homs, Lattakia, and Amouda, according to videos posted on YouTube. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the videos. In a number of other cities across Syria, citizen journalists captured cell-phone videos of protesters scattering en masse as sounds of gunshots erupted and white smoke swept over the streets. In Jableh, a coastal city in Latakia Province, one man shouted, ""Serious injuries, tear gas. I can't see."" Another person died Friday of injuries suffered in another demonstration a couple of days ago, bringing the day's death count to 11, according to the London-based Syria Observatory for Human Rights. The state-run SANA news organization put Friday's death toll during the protests at seven civilians and law-enforcement personnel. Friday's protests were held in Hama, Homs, Deir El Zour, Idlib, Qameshli and Latakia, and in the al-Midane and Qaboun neighborhoods in Damascus, according to Rami Abdelrahman, head of the activist group. Of Friday's 11 deaths, four people died in demonstrations in Barza, a suburb of Damascus; three died in Homs, in the west; two died in Kaswa, near Damascus; and one died in Qoseir, near the Lebanese border. One person injured in Hama in a demonstration a couple of days ago died of his injuries Friday. Until Thursday, CNN has been barred from officially entering Syria and its reporting about events inside the country had been limited largely to what the network was able to piece together based on official government reports and accounts and videos posted on the Internet. Recently, the government granted access to CNN journalists, who arrived Thursday in Syria, where they were assigned government ""minders"" to accompany them on video shoots. The minders said they had not received permission to take the journalists to the areas where protests were occurring. Instead, they took the journalists to Damascus' historic old city, where their appearance on the streets prompted a crowd of a few dozen Syrians to erupt into pro-government chants. Posters and pictures of President Bashar al-Assad quickly materialized. The demonstrators raged against foreign powers, saying the unrest in Syria is the result of an international conspiracy -- one that includes the news media -- and is intended to bring down the regime. ""We feel like the international media is conducting a world war against us,"" said Mohammed al-Hamwi, 67. ""Not a single outlet has broadcast a real image of what is happening."" Government officials told CNN personnel that they were worried about the journalists' safety with so many ""armed gangs"" fomenting unrest throughout the country. The government has blamed ""armed gangs"" in explaining its military crackdowns, which have led thousands of Syrians to cross into Turkey. The Hatay governor's office in Turkey said Friday that at least 11,739 Syrians have done so. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said 500 displaced people have returned home. A supporter of the Syrian government said Friday that even those who have fled are part of a scheme to smear the government. ""I refuse to call them refugees; they are hostages taken to bring down the regime,"" said Naime Mahmoud el-Sheik, her voice shaking with emotion. ""We are with the regime. We are with Assad."" Rumors are rife, with some saying that the anti-government demonstrators have been sprayed with poisoned water that makes them more aggressive; that terrorists are killing protesters and blaming the security forces. As more violence unfolded in Syria, the European Council condemned the nation Friday, saying the ""regime is calling its legitimacy into question"" by opting for a ""path of repression instead of fulfilling its own promises on broad reforms."" The European Council -- comprising the heads of state of European Union member states -- deplored the ""ongoing repression and unacceptable and shocking violence the Syrian regime continues to apply against its own citizens."" It also expressed grave concern about reports of Syrian military activity near the Turkish border at Khirbet al-Jouz and urged ""maximum restraint."" This comes after the Council of the European Union voted Thursday to expand sanctions against Syria by freezing the assets of seven people and four businesses with connections to the regime. The detail was published in the European Union's Official Journal on Friday, and British Foreign Secretary William Hague hailed the measures. ""These measures are carefully targeted and focused on those responsible for violent repression,"" Hague said. ""Contrary to the Syrian authorities' claims, the economic problems Syria is facing are a direct and predictable consequence of the Syrian authorities' decision to choose repression over reform."" Among those sanctioned were three commanders in Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps accused of helping the ""regime suppress protests"" and ""providing equipment and support"" to the government, according to the European Union Official Journal. One of the three is Brig. Cmdr. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the corps' general commander. ""I welcome the inclusion of three Iranian individuals on the list,"" Hague said. ""The Iranian government's provision of equipment and technical advice to help suppress peaceful protests is absolutely unacceptable. Iran's actions are in stark contrast to the will of the Syrian people. They also highlight again Iran's blatant hypocrisy, claiming publicly to support freedom in the Arab world, while privately assisting in violent repression."" Two of those sanctioned were first cousins of the president. They are Zoulhima Chaliche, head of presidential security, and Riyad Chaliche, director of the military housing establishment. Two others were business associates of Maher al-Assad, the president's brother and commander of the army's 4th Division and ""strongman of the Republican Guard."" Maher al-Assad was among 23 Syrian officials sanctioned by the EU in May, and he is regarded as the principal overseer of the crackdown against protesters. Others sanctioned at that time were the president; Ali Mamluk, the head of Syria's general intelligence directorate; and Rami Makhlouf, the Syrian businessman and cousin and confidant of the president. Anti-government protests have raged in Syria for more than three months, with demonstrations gaining momentum amid a tough government crackdown. The number of estimated deaths has exceeded 1,600, Abdelrahman said, with 1,316 civilians and 341 soldiers and security forces killed. About 10,000 people have been jailed, he said. Nadim Houri of Human Rights Watch said the number of people killed is 1,350.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal insists he is more motivated by winning titles than retaining the No. 1 ranking as the tennis season makes its quick switch from clay to grass this week. The Spaniard has swapped Paris for London after clinching a record-equaling sixth French Open title on Sunday as he begins preparations to defend his Wimbledon crown. The 24-year-old would have lost his top ranking if Roger Federer had not ended Novak Djokovic's 41-match unbeaten run this season in the semifinals at Roland Garros.

I've been number one two times, I was happy for that but more important for me is the titles than that number one.""

However, Djokovic has pulled out due to knee problems, while Federer has withdrawn from the German event in Halle to rest his groin injury. The Swiss star, a record 16-time grand slam champion, had been hoping to win one of his favorite events for the sixth time before trying to match Pete Sampras' mark of seven Wimbledon titles. ""The grass is always a special feeling and it's good fun to play on grass,"" Nadal said. ""I like the surface, I love to play there. You can do different things -- you can attack, you can go to the net -- so it's fun to try to adapt my game as fast as possible to the grass because I only have two weeks."" Nadal equals Borg with record sixth French Open title . Nadal had a disappointing start to this season when he suffered a hamstring injury during his quarterfinal defeat at the Australian Open, ending his bid to hold all four grand slam titles. His dominance was further threatened when Djokovic beat him in four successive Masters Series finals, including two on his beloved clay in Madrid and Rome. ""The beginning of the season wasn't easy because I had an injury in Australia and I got sick in Doha, but after that I was healthy and I was able to play very well the rest of the season,"" Nadal said.

"(CNN) -- French champions Lille have revealed that Ivory Coast striker Gervinho has expressed an interest in moving to the English Premier League, and transfer talks are planned with Arsenal in the coming weeks. In an interview with radio station RMC, Lille general manager Frederic Paquet revealed: ""He wants to go and has developed contacts with Arsenal. ""We will soon have talks with them and see what they offer. He has expressed a desire to go to England and we will see what happens."" Paquet also confirmed that Paris St Germain had enquired about the player, but the 24-year-old would not be sold to a French rival.

"(CNN) -- A deadly bacterial outbreak that has killed at least 23 people in Europe is limited to an area around the German city of Hamburg and does not require Europe-wide controls, a top European Union official said Tuesday. ""There is no reason as of today to take ... measures at (the) European level,"" EU Health Commissioner John Dalli said, adding, ""We consider any ban on any product as disproportionate."" A new death in Germany due to the E. coli outbreak was announced Tuesday, bringing the total there to 22. The other death, in Sweden, was of a person who had visited Germany. Top European farming officials met Tuesday in Luxembourg, where EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos proposed a 150 million euro ($220 million) compensation plan for farmers affected by the panic. But he said that offer may have to be increased in the face of complaints that it's not enough. Farmers are demanding compensation for losses due to being wrongly blamed for causing the outbreak. Spain alone seeks about $600 million in lost farm exports of cucumbers, tomatoes and other produce from the past few weeks, and farmers in Belgium, France, Holland and even Germany say they have millions of dollars in losses, too. Ciolos said the EU Commission may come back with an ""improved offer"" as early as Wednesday, and hopes to have a decision within days. But he said paying 100 percent of claims -- as some countries demanded at the meeting -- would not be possible given the EU budget restraints. ""The commission is assuming its responsibility within the limits of our regulation and of our budget,"" Ciolos said. The cause of the outbreak remains unclear, as new test results Tuesday proved negative. There was no trace of E. coli in a pack of bean sprouts in a household in Hamburg, where a man had become infected, health authorities there told CNN. The sprouts came from the farm which officials believe could be the source of the outbreak. But initial tests showed no sign of E. coli there, agriculture officials in the German state of Lower Saxony said Monday. But authorities said that does not mean their suspicions are not correct; they would not expect to find evidence of E. coli if the tainted sprouts were no longer in the supply chain. Test results are back for 20 of the 40 samples, Lower Saxony officials said Monday. It was not clear when the rest of the test results would be available. On Sunday, officials said German-grown sprouts are the likely source for the E. coli outbreak. ""There is a direct link between this company and these people getting sick,"" said Gert Lindemann, the agricultural minister in Lower Saxony. It was not clear how the rare strain may have gotten into the sprouts, officials said. E. coli has not been found in the company, Gaertnerhof, which has halted production and is recalling its products. Gaertnerhof, in the town of Bienenbuettel, said in a statement it was ""shocked and worried. ... that part of our production has been linked to E. coli infections"" and had never had a problem in its 25 years of growing sprouts. It said it had found no evidence of E. coli during routine testing in January or during tests last month in response to the health scare. But a leading German microbiologist said Monday that sprouts were a ""plausible"" source of the infection. Sprouts can harbor bacteria, which can spread during the growing process, said Alexander Kekule of the University of Halle-Wittenberg. ""Either it was inside the seed, which I do not think is the case, or the bacteria was inside the water,"" Kekule said on Germany's NDR radio. He is not working directly on the case. Sprouts are bred in drums that are heated to slightly warmer than body temperature -- ideal conditions for the growth not only of sprouts, but of bacteria, the agriculture ministry of Lower Saxony said. Authorities say the sprouts may have become tainted so long ago that trace-back tests may never identify the company as the source. But several restaurants and cafeterias linked to the outbreak got sprouts from the company, officials said. And two workers at the agricultural company have come down with severe cases of diarrhea; in at least one of those cases, E. coli was the cause, Lindemann said. Bienenbuettel is in the district of Uelzen in north-central Germany. Last week, Spain rejected suggestions that its cucumbers could have been the source after the European Food Safety Alert Network said E. coli bacteria were found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to various countries. Authorities initially called for the cucumbers to be pulled from sale. But Germany later said Spanish produce was not the source of the infection -- leading to the claims for compensation. Ciolos said that some farmers who belong to producer organizations might also find additional compensation there, and that some of those funds are also backed by the Commission. The Commission will need to document how the compensation money is paid out, he said. A growers' cooperative representative in southern Spain said earlier Tuesday that farmers around the town of El Ejido, a major year-round producer of fresh produce under expansive greenhouses, are busy filling out claims forms already. The outbreak of the virulent strain of E. coli has infected more than 2,400 people in at least 13 countries, European health authorities said Monday. The vast majority are in Germany, where doctors have found 630 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) -- a form of kidney failure -- in the current outbreak, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. That's more cases of HUS than in any other recorded outbreak worldwide. Fifteen patients in Germany have died of HUS, according to the center, while six died of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, a strain that can result in abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea and causes intestinal hemorrhaging. The center said 1,601 people have that E. coli strain but do not have HUS. Infections have also been identified in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, according to the organization.

"Paris (CNN) -- Investigators trying to determine why an Air France plane crashed mysteriously two years ago have recovered the complete contents of the flight data recorder and the last two hours of cockpit conversation, they announced Monday. It will take several weeks to analyze the data, French air accident experts said. All 228 people aboard Air France 447 were killed when the Airbus A330 belly-flopped into the ocean June 1, 2009, in stormy weather. The cause of the crash is still not known. Discovering that there was data on the recorders ""is excellent news. It is really going to help us work out what happened on that plane,"" said Martine Del Bono, spokeswoman for France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA). Q&A: Will the mystery of Flight 447 be solved? The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were found at the beginning of May after an unprecedented series of submarine searches of a mountain range 3,900 meters (12,700 feet) under the ocean. They were brought to the surface and taken to Paris by ship and plane. The investigators also recovered two bodies from the fuselage -- after finding only about 50 bodies in the days immediately after the crash. They will not bring more bodies up from the ocean if they cannot identify the two they already have, they said Thursday. Those two bodies are being examined to see if there is enough DNA to identify them, investigators said, adding that they hope to have results by Wednesday. If they can identify the remains, they will consider bringing up other bodies from the wreckage. The bulk of the plane was located earlier this year and contains many more human remains, according to investigators. Recovering more bodies will be a difficult task, with miles of cable required to bring each one up over a period of three hours, they said. Investigators also brought an engine and an avionics bay containing computers to the surface, they said. The pilots of Air France 447 lost contact with air traffic controllers on June 1, 2009, while flying across an area of the Atlantic known for severe turbulence, officials said. But exactly what caused the plane to plunge into the ocean remains a mystery. The plane slammed into the water while en route from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, falling so fast that air masks did not have time to deploy. The fuselage was discovered in April with bodies still inside, investigators said. Some relatives of those who died have expressed reservations about remains being brought to the surface. Last month Robert Soulas, head of a support group for families of flight victims, said: ""For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed."" Other relatives have called for the bodies to be recovered.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani military removed the chief of the Sindh Rangers as the fallout continues over the taped killing of an unarmed teenager by the paramilitary forces. On Friday, the Supreme Court called on the government to transfer Maj.Gen. Ijaz Chaudhary from his post -- an order that has since been carried out. ""In compliance with supreme courts orders Major General Ijaz Chaudhary, DG Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) has been posted out,"" the military said in a brief statement Wednesday. The statement did not say where Chaudhary had been placed. Meanwhile, the six members of the paramilitary force who are accused of killing the teen last week have been turned over to police and will be tried under the country's terrorism act, a police official said Monday. The Supreme Court has sent the case to an anti-terrorist court, which was ordered to conclude proceedings within a month, said Ahtisham Ali, a senior Karachi police official. Anti-Terrorist Courts in Pakistan are special courts where hearings are expedited and decisions come more quickly than in the regular court system. The accused -- members of the Sindh Rangers -- can be seen opening fire on 17-year-old Sarfraz Shah in a video captured by a local television cameraman and broadcast across Pakistan's networks last week. Before being shot twice, Shah pleads with the men carrying automatic rifles. ""I am helpless,"" he cries. ""Please do not fire."" Shah begs to be taken to a hospital before bleeding to death. The incident was the latest in a series of human rights incidents that has horrified the south Asian nation and deeply eroded public confidence in security agencies. ""This kind of anger among the public and even politicians hasn't been seen before,"" said Zohra Yusuf, chairwoman of the Pakistan Human Rights Commission. ""It was the way the young man was brutally shot dead in close quarters,"" she said. ""And the footage showed very clearly that he was not armed. The footage itself is so crystal clear. It tells the whole story."" Shah tried to rob people at a park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Karachi police official Rafiq Gulsaid Shah pointed a pistol and wanted to steal cash and cell phones. He was handed over to park security and then to the Rangers. Shah apparently tried to snatch the Rangers' guns, Gul said. That's when the soldiers opened fire. The video shows Shah reaching for their weapons before backing away. Interior Minister Rehman Malik vowed justice but tempered his comments about Shah. ""There should be no doubt that this video shows an unjust action,"" he said. ""Action will be taken against the soldiers, but no one should forget he (the victim) is a criminal. He pointed a pistol at two women and then he tried to rob them. ""There are two things -- one, his criminal record, and another, an unjust killing,"" Malik said. ""I assure the relatives of the victim the investigation will be transparent and neutral and the results will be made public. These are the criminals that create problems for the public, but it does not justify killing like this."" Shah's family insisted that the Rangers had killed an innocent man. ""My son was innocent,"" his mother said. ""They killed him.""

"(CNN) -- Monaco's Royal Palace on Wednesday denied a published report that Prince Albert's bride-to-be, Charlene Wittstock, discovered information about the prince and tried to flee to her native South Africa but was stopped by police. ""The Royal Palace formally denies the false allegations published on the site www.lexpress.fr,"" the palace statement said, pointing out that the report was published ""just days before the wedding ceremony between S.A.S. Prince Albert and Miss Charlene Wittstock."" ""The sole intention of these rumors is to seriously damage the image of the Sovereign, as a result of damaging that of Miss Wittstock, and bear down on this happy event,"" the statement concluded. Albert's adviser, Christiane Stahl, told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that the two were inititally ""completely disappointed"" by the story. ""Then, they were hurt, but not for long because they know, especially the prince, that rumors are part of his life. But I think that among all of what he has heard, this one was more hurtful than others because it is damaging and the purpose of this rumor is to damage a happy event, his wedding."" The French news magazine L'Express reported Tuesday that a ""shaken"" Wittstock made a hasty departure to Nice Airport where she intended to board a one-way flight to South Africa, having discovered several hours before that the private life of her fiance was ""not as exemplary as she imagined."" Sources were not named in the unsigned article. L'Express also reported that Wittstock, a former Olympic swimmer, was stopped by airport officials and that it took intense persuasion from Albert and his entourage to get her to stay and agree to go through with the marriage. The 53-year-old prince and ruler of Monaco, the only son of Princess Grace and the late Prince Rainier, has never married. In 2005, Albert publicly acknowledged having fathered a son with a flight attendant, and he has also acknowledged a daughter, now in her late teens. The couple appeared contented Tuesday afternoon, when they were seen walking arm-in-arm along Monaco's Port Hercule, accompanied by musician Jean-Michel Jarre, who is to perform Friday evening as part of the wedding celebrations.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Outside the jail where he is staying, though he isn't a prisoner, Indian activist Anna Hazare has a growing crowd of supporters to back him up. ""Even if we die, we will remain adamant in our protest. We will not move from here,"" said Tarun Garg, one of Hazare's supporters, on Wednesday. Hazare was planning to go on a hunger strike to call for stronger anti-corruption measures when he was detained Tuesday. As thousands took to the streets to protest the arrest, authorities let him free, but he refused to leave the jail. Now it looks like the anti-corruption crusader has accepted a police proposal that will allow him to fast in New Delhi for two weeks. Hazare adviser Kiran Bedi said on Twitter that police removed ""unacceptable conditions"" and will allow the protest to begin Thursday afternoon. The social reformer has become an unlikely figurehead for the fight against corruption in the country. Hazare, 74, was not known nationally until recently. His protest seems to have struck a chord with Indian society across the spectrum because corruption is pervasive at all levels of government, observers say. He has been able to mobilize public support because there is so much dissatisfaction with the issue. Citizens have even created a website -- ipaidabribe.com -- where people can denounce the corruption they encounter in their daily lives. The prime minister's handling of the protest appears to have added to Hazare's status, because it makes it look like the government is going after the messenger rather than offering solutions. Corruption is considered an endemic problem that affects all levels of Indian society. According to a 2010 Transparency International report, India ranked 87th out of 178 countries in its corruption-perception index. In April, Suresh Kalmadi, the chief organizer for last year's Commonwealth Games, was arrested and accused of buying a time, scoring and result system from a Swiss company at inflated costs. Meanwhile, India's former telecom minister A. Raja, several bureaucrats and corporate officials are facing trial in connection with a multi-billion-dollar scandal involving the suspected below-price sale of mobile-phone radio waves or spectrum in 2008. The draw that Hazare's planned hunger strike has was so great that police first tried to put conditions on it. Organizers did not accept six of 22 police conditions for allowing the protest, including limiting the crowd to the capacity of the ground, police said. As a result, Hazare was detained, as were 1,300 supporters who planned to join Hazare at a protest site. A magistrate sent Hazare and seven supporters to jail after they failed to post bail, according to Rajan Bhagat, a police spokesman in New Delhi. They were freed hours later and shifted to a prison office after the magistrate issued release orders, jail spokesman Sunil Gupta said. The group had refused to leave the prison office until they are allowed to hold their hunger strike without unacceptable conditions, the jail spokesman said. Thousands gathered in several cities, chanting pro-Hazare slogans and echoing his demands. Supporters carrying Indian flags held sit-ins, marches and noisy demonstrations. Many had ""I am Anna"" labels on their shirts. Hazare conducted a similar five-day hunger strike in April at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar landmark, ending it after India's prime minister agreed to introduce long-pending legislation meant to crack down on graft. Anti-corruption campaigners have rejected legislation prepared by the federal government to create a citizen ombudsman, saying the bill, now in Parliament, is too weak to tackle endemic graft in the system. Critics have accused the activists of undermining lawmakers who will decide the proposed law. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday justified the arrests in a statement before Parliament. ""Our government acknowledges the right of citizens to hold peaceful protests,"" he said. Hazare and his supporters would have been allowed to hold their protest fast if they had accepted the conditions, he said. Amid shouts by opposition lawmakers over the police response to Hazare's protest, the Indian prime minister also cited supremacy of the legislature. ""I am not aware of any constitutional philosophy or principle that allows anyone to question the sole prerogative of parliament to make a law,"" he said. Singh, whose government is roiled in massive corruption scandals, acknowledged in a national address earlier in the week that no single measure could handle chronic corruption. ""I believe that there is no single big step which we can take to eradicate corruption. In fact, we will have to act simultaneously on many fronts,"" Singh said. Campaigners' insistence on not accepting legislation other than their own version of the anti-corruption bill was ""beyond comprehension,"" Home Minister P. Chidambaram told reporters Tuesday. ""How can you indirectly endorse such an argument that it is his bill and no other bill (that is acceptable)?"" he said. Police took Hazare into custody after the veteran activist told officers that he would ""defy"" orders not to hold a demonstration, Chidambaram said. He said Hazare and his supporters were welcome to raise their concerns with a parliamentary committee that will scrutinize the legislation before it is presented to lawmakers for a vote. Activists appealed to government employees to take a day off work in a show of solidarity with Hazare, a call federal officials were quick to term ""wrong."" ""I sincerely hope that the government servants don't respond to such wrong calls,"" Chidambaram said. CNN's Ram Ramgopal contributed to this report.","NEW: Police reportedly remove conditions on fast, Hazare adviser says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A former federal lawmaker is among at least 33 people killed in a fresh spate of violence over the past 24 hours in the Pakistani city of Karachi, police officials said Thursday. Several gunmen opened fire on Wajid Karimdad on Wednesday night shortly after he entered a restaurant for Iftar, the traditional post-fasting meal during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, said Karachi police official Naeem Shah. Police suspect the gunmen targeted Karimdad, a member of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party. Most of the deaths on Wednesday night and Thursday morning were the result of drive-by shootings in Lyari and Baldia, two districts in Karachi that have been hit hard by years of ethnic and political violence. Some of the victims were shot to death after they were kidnapped, Shah told CNN. Officials say the killings appear to be linked to ongoing rivalries between three political parties vying for power in Pakistan largest city: the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), the Awami National Party (ANP), and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The PPP, led by President Asif Ali Zardari, views Karachi as a crucial political battleground, but politics in Pakistan's economic hub are dominated by the MQM, which represents ""muhajirs,"" descendants of immigrants from India decades ago. The ANP is a secular Pashtun party based in militant-plagued northwest Pakistan, whose supporters have migrated south to Karachi because of the violence in their home region. ANP supporters have the same ethnicity as the Taliban, so the MQM often accuses them of supporting militants. The ANP, in turn, accuses the MQM of organized crime and terrorist activity. Supporters of the PPP are accused of having links to criminal gangs as well. Analysts say lack of law enforcement has allowed supporters of the political parties to adopt a gang-like mentality. Police officials claim low pay, a lack of manpower and resources puts the police force at a disadvantage against the criminal gangs fueling the violence. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, violence between supporters of the political parties and other turf wars in Karachi have killed more than 1,000 people this year alone.

"(CNN) -- Waterlogged Vermont and northern New York braced for more rain a week after Tropical Storm Irene destroyed roads and sent floodwaters cascading into homes and businesses. A flash flood watch for the region has been issued for Sunday evening through Tuesday morning, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Abundant moisture from Tropical Storm Lee, moving up from the Gulf of Mexico, will interact with an approaching cold front to produce widespread rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with localized amounts of 4 inches possible, Morris said. A flash flood watch means conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding. Although the forecast was too far out to show precisely where the heaviest rain might fall, ""it could be trouble,"" especially for the southern part of the state, said Mark Bosma, spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. ""The ground is already saturated and some of the road beds have been washed out."" Irene killed 43 people from Florida to New England as it marched up the Eastern Seaboard over the weekend, dumping torrential rain. Some of the worst flooding struck Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York. Swiftwater rescue teams have been put on notice, Bosma told CNN on Saturday. The state and towns are already in an emergency operations mode because of Irene. ""It's all hands on deck,"" Bosma said of road crews, which have been busy across the state with emergency repairs. National Guard engineers and other personnel, including a contingent from Maine, are working this weekend on bridges and thoroughfares. Towns are being informed of the latest weather conditions, Bosma said. Power outages in Vermont from Irene were down from a high of 50,000 to about 300 Saturday, he added.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden's wife has told interrogators she didn't venture outside the walled compound where the al Qaeda leader was killed for five years, a Pakistani military spokesman said Thursday. The wife, who was wounded in the raid, said she lived in the compound in Abbottabad with eight of bin Laden's children and five others from another family, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN. All of them have been in Pakistani custody since the pre-dawn U.S. commando raid Monday that killed bin Laden and they will eventually be returned to their country of origin, Abbas said. The many wives of Osama bin Laden . The news came as Pakistan's armed forces acknowledged intelligence ""shortcomings"" after the world's most-wanted man was hunted down and killed in a city north of their capital. A military statement said an investigation would be launched, but warned that the U.S. raid that killed bin Laden has jeopardized its cooperation with American forces. Abbas said he wasn't sure from the wife's questioning how long bin Laden had lived in the compound or whether he had ventured outside during the five-year period his wife described. He identified the wife as ""Amal,"" but said he could not confirm her full name. Amal al-Sadah, 29-years-old and originally from Yemen, is the youngest of bin Laden's five wives. The al Qaeda leader had a total of 20 children, and one of his adult sons was also reported killed in the weekend assault. With a $25 million U.S. bounty on his head, bin Laden turned out to have been living in a three-story home in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad -- about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Islamabad and a short distance from a leading Pakistani military academy. American critics have questioned how Pakistani officials could have missed the compound, and U.S. officials have said Washington did not give Pakistan any notice of the assault because they feared the word would leak. Material shows threats to railways, key cities . Pakistan backed the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban in Afghanistan before the Taliban-allied al Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 11, 2001. U.S. officials have warned that some elements of Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency remain supportive of extremists even as Pakistan battles its own Taliban insurgency. In a statement from Pakistan's military headquarters, the country's armed service chiefs defended the ISI's efforts in attacking al Qaeda leaders, but said there had been ""shortcomings in developing intelligence on the presence of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan."" The statement said an investigation will be launched ""into the circumstances that led to this situation."" FBI: New attacks were being plotted . But the army chief of staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, ""made it very clear that any similar action, violating the sovereignty of Pakistan, will warrant a review on the level of military/intelligence cooperation with the United States,"" the statement said. And Pakistan has ordered U.S. military personnel on its territory drawn down to the ""minimum essential"" level in the wake of the assault that killed bin Laden deep within Pakistan early Monday, the statement announced. The U.S. military has had a small contingent of troops operating as trainers for Pakistani security forces for at least three years. Three Americans taking part in that mission were killed in a roadside bombing along the rugged border between Afghanistan and Pakistan in February 2010. Breaking down the key points of bin Laden raid . Pakistan is also a key supply route for the U.S. and NATO troops battling the Taliban in Afghanistan, with truck convoys often coming under attack near the border. But those runs are made by contractors, not U.S. troops. Mark Grossman, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, had some ""very blunt"" conversations with Pakistani officials in the wake of the bin Laden raid, according to two senior U.S. officials briefed on the talks. In meetings with Kayani and Lt. Gen. Ahmad Pasha, the ISI's chief, Grossman discussed the need for Pakistan to improve its cooperation on counterterrorism in the wake of the bin Laden operation, the officials said. But the officials said that there is still no evidence that points to the senior levels of the Pakistani military or the ISI knowing that bin Laden was hiding out in that compound. And Pakistani Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir told reporters Thursday that any suggestion that the intelligence service or the government were covering for bin Laden ""is absolutely wrong."" In fact, he said, the ISI alerted U.S. intelligence agencies to the presence of al Qaeda operatives in Abbottabad as early as 2004. ""It is easy to say that the ISI and elements in the government are in cahoots with al Qaeda,"" he said. ""This is a false charge. It cannot be validated, on any account."" Kayani and Pasha both warned that comments like the ones by CIA Director Leon Panetta -- who told U.S. lawmakers in a closed-door session Tuesday that Pakistani officials were either ""involved or incompetent"" in bin Laden's case -- were unhelpful. Still, they said that they wanted to work through the problems between the Washington and Islamabad, the senior U.S. officials said. Two key senators defend Pakistan aid . Bashir, too, tried to temper any reports of a rift between Pakistan and the United States. He said there has been an ""excellent exchange of views"" between the two sides in recent days, a positive rapport he expects to continue even as Pakistan opens a ""review"" of how bin Laden was able to stay in Abbottabad, deals with the ramifications of accusations it could have done more and addresses issues of its terroritorial sovereignty after U.S. forces got into Pakistan undetected. ""We have cooperated with the United States in the past. We look forward to continuing this cooperation at all levels,"" Bashir said.

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal has crashed out in the quarterfinals of the Queen's Club tournament in London, beaten in three sets by Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Wimbledon champion Nadal, who flew straight to the grasscourt event on the back of winning a record-equalling sixth French Open title,  struggled for form throughout the week and was eventually sent tumbling 6-7 6-4 6-1 by fifth-seeded Tsonga. Nadal admitted he felt 'exhausted' going into the tournament, but the result was still a major shock, with the Spaniard having reached seven successive finals prior to this defeat. Nadal struggles past Stepanek to reach quarters . ""After losing the second set, mentally I lost my concentration -- it has been a lot of matches in a row,"" Nadal told reporters. ""I am a little tired. I wasn't there like usual and certainly I think I need a little bit of break,"" he continued. A delighted Tsonga added: ""The first time I reached the world top 100 was here at Queen's and today I have beaten the world number one. It was close to my best tennis -- it has to be to beat Rafa."" Tsonga will now face unheralded wildcard Jamie Ward in the semifinals after the British number two, ranked 216th in the world, reached his first-ever ATP Tour semfinal with a 6-2 6-7 6-2 win over Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. Meanwhile, Andy Roddick and Andy Murray will clash in the other semifinal after both players cruised through in completely different circumstances. British No.1 and second seed Murray secured his place in the last four when scheduled opponent Marin Cilic of Croatia was forced to pull out of their quarterfinal with an ankle injury. Ironically, Murray himself has been battling a similar problem, picked up in last week's French Open, and the Scot beat Janko Tipsarevic on Thursday with a brace attached to his damaged right ankle. ""I would have rather played today, and got another match on the grass. It wasn't to be,"" Murray told reporters. ""I just have to take this day as a rest day, which in some ways is probably a good thing,"" he added. The extra day's rest could well prove crucial prior to Saturday's clash with third seed Roddick, who remains on course for a record fifth title on the London grass after crusing to a straight sets victory over seventh-seeded Spaniard Fernando Verdasco. Six players have won four Queen's titles, including John McEnroe and Boris Becker, but Roddick will surpass them all if he carries on the form he showed in an impressive 6-2 6-2 win. Meanwhile, holder Lleyton Hewitt is out of the Halle grasscourt tournament in Germany, beaten at the quarterfinal stage by local favorite Philipp Kohlschreiber. Kohlschreiber reached the semifinals for the fourth time in his career, securing a 7-6 6-3 win in 90 minutes, smashing down 14 aces in the process. He will now face third seed Gael Monfils, after the Frenchman beat Florian Mayer 6-4 6-4. Another German, Philipp Petzschner, also secured his place with a 6-3 6-7 6-3 victory over eighth seed Milos Raonic. The 27-year-old Petzschner will now meet 2007 Halle winner Tomas Berdych, the top seed after Roger Federer's withdrawal on Monday, who saw off fifth seed Viktor Troicki of Serbia 7-6 6-1.","World number one Rafael Nadal crashes out of the Queen's Club event .

"(CNN) -- ""I'm not a machine, and like everybody I have better moments than others,"" Rafael Nadal told CNN in Shanghai. After a year disrupted by injury, it was a moment of candor from the down-to-Earth 23-year-old, whose winning ways on the court had at times made him seem invincible. ""Tennis is a hard sport, a very, very tough mental sport because you play a lot of matches during the season and you have to be ready every week. So you need to be very focused all the time -- 100 percent physical and mental -- if you want to have chances to have a good result. ""Sometimes you feel you need to stop. I played every week for a long time and I forgot I had to stop for an injury."" Taking time out of the game earlier this summer to recover from tendonitis in his knees, Nadal missed out on defending his 2008 Wimbledon title, won in an epic final match against world number 1, Roger Federer. Making his comeback just before the U.S. Open in August, he played into some form to reach the final of the Shanghai Masters tournament in October. Even though he won five major tournaments in the first half of 2009, the lack of silverwear in the second half of 2009 isn't a worry. He retains his will to win and is happy that his job is something he loves. ""I never excepted be number two or Number one and have the chance to win Grand Slams. That's unbelievable for me, you know, I feel I'm a very lucky person because I work in tennis. My work is playing tennis and it's my hobby too, you know, so not everybody can work in one of his hobbies, so I feel lucky for that,"" he told CNN. With six Grand Slam titles to his name already, the Majorcan believes he has a long future ahead of him in the game, despite his recent injury setback. ""I have seven years of my career right now and I am not finished, so I expect be here and hope be here for a long time.""","23-year-old Spanish tennis player lost his Number 1 ranking this year .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- Sudan threatened to withdraw from peace talks with rebels in the western Darfur region unless an agreement was struck by Thursday. ""If we reach an agreement tomorrow then God be praised but if we don't then we will withdraw our negotiating team,"" President Omar al-Bashir said at a rally Wednesday in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur state. Al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in the western Darfur region, said he would not deal with rebels bearing arms after the talks ended in Doha, Qatar. ""These (rebel) movements are enjoying the negotiation process and their residency in foreign hotels while the people of Darfur are suffering the flames of war,"" al-Bashir said. ""We will not negotiate with anyone who carries a gun and claims to lead an armed group that represents the will of the people."" The anti-government Justice and Equality Movement called al-Bashir's statement a declaration of war. ""What the president said yesterday has blocked the way ahead on the road to a political solution,"" said a statement from Ahmed Hussein Adam, a spokesman for the group. ""It is a declaration of war and a limiting of any future chance for peace."" Fighting erupted in 2003 between rebel groups and al-Bashir's Arab-dominated government in Khartoum. More than 300,000 people have been killed in this desolate region, where hopes for peace have gone up and down over the last few months. Negotiators had previously set a December 31 deadline for agreement in the peace talks, which have so far not made much progress. The deadline was ahead of a key referendum on independence for Southern Sudan that begins January 9. North and South, dominated by non-Arab Christians and animists, have fought one of Africa's longest-running civil wars. The Darfur conflict is separate from the North-South divide, but independence for the South could help embolden rebels in Darfur.","Omar al-Bashir says unless a deal is reached Thursday, the talks will end .

"(CNN) -- Croatia midfielder Luka Modric will not be sold to Chelsea, according to the chairman of his English Premier League club Tottenham. The 25-year-old has been the subject of transfer speculation after helping the London side reach the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League last season, and his manager Harry Redknapp on Thursday ridiculed a bid of $35.5 million for the player. Modric, who cost Spurs $27 million when he signed from Dinamo Zagreb in 2008, was on Saturday quoted by English newspaper the Daily Mail as saying he wanted to join London rivals Chelsea. In response, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy issued a statement on the club's website confirming that Chelsea's initial approach had been turned down and that he had not invited an improved offer. ""I wish to make it absolutely clear, as I have said previously, that none of our key players will be sold this summer. We are building a team for the future to consistently play at the highest level, and retaining quality players is crucial to that,"" Levy said. ""In respect of Luka Modric, we are not prepared to sell, at any price, to Chelsea Football Club or any other club. We made our stance on this issue abundantly clear in writing to Chelsea. They chose to ignore it and then subsequently made the offer public. ""For the avoidance of any doubt, let me reiterate that we shall not enter into any negotiations whatsoever, with any club, regarding Luka. We now consider this matter closed."" With Tottenham playing in Europe's second-tier Europa League next season after finishing fifth in the Premier League, Modric appears keen to join a club fighting for major titles. Second-placed Chelsea sacked manager Carlo Ancelotti after a trophyless season following a league and cup double in his first campaign, and the Italian's replacement has yet to be announced. ""If somebody comes to the club and the offer is good for me and acceptable to them, then I want to leave,"" Modric told the Daily Mail. ""I want to leave Tottenham as friends. I have enjoyed my time there, but now it is right for me to look at another club. ""I have an arrangement with the chairman. When I signed my new contract, he said that, if another club came to sign me, they would consider the offer. I won't ask for a transfer, no. That would be disrespectful. I hope they can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for everyone. ""Chelsea are a big club with an ambitious owner. They have great players and they have ambitions to fight for the title and win the Champions League. I want to stay in London. I am very happy here and so are my family."" Despite not having a manager in place, Chelsea officials are in talks with highly-rated young Belgium international striker Romelu Lukaku, the 18-year-old striker's club Anderlecht revealed on Friday. Meanwhile, English club Newcastle United signed former France under-21 midfielder Sylvain Marveaux on a five-year contract from Rennes on Saturday. The 25-year-old will bolster Newcastle's midfield ranks following the departure of club captain Kevin Nolan to relegated West Ham. Marveaux follows West Ham's Senegal international striker Demba Ba in moving to St James' Park, where he will link up with compatriots Hatem Ben Arfa and Yohan Cabaye.","Tottenham unhappy with Chelsea's attempt to sign playmaker Luka Modric .

"New York (CNN) -- Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. will not recuse himself from prosecuting the case against former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn for the attempted rape of a hotel housekeeper, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. ""Any suggestion that this office should be recused is wholly without merit,"" Erin Duggan said in a statement. The announcement came in response to the call earlier in the day from an attorney for the housekeeper. ""We make this request in order to protect the integrity of the prosecution of Mr. Stauss-Kahn, to ensure the victim's rights are not further prejudiced by deliberate acts seeking to undermine her credibility, to insulate your office from the appearance of conflict of interest, and to ensure that future victims of sex crimes, regardless of their backgrounds, are not dissuaded from coming forward,"" wrote Kenneth P. Thompson in a four-page letter to Vance. Strauss-Kahn, 62. is accused of having attempted to rape the maid when she entered his suite at the Sofitel off Times Square on May 14 in order to clean it. Thompson said Vance's office ""apparently has been responsible"" for leaks to the news media ""that were intended to discredit the victim's character and, perhaps most importantly, undermine her charges against Mr. Strauss-Kahn."" He cited a telephone call he received June 30 from Chief Assistant District Attorney Daniel R. Alonso, informing him of the prosecutor's decision to turn over to the defense ""certain false statements"" that the victim had told investigators. During the call, he said Alonso had told him about an audio recording obtained by the prosecution in which the alleged victim told an incarcerated person a day after the alleged attack ""about the possible benefits"" of pursuing charges against Strauss-Kahn. ""When I asked Mr. Alonso specifically about what the victim had allegedly said during that conversation, he stated that the victim said 'words to the effect' that 'this guy has a lot of money. I know what I'm doing.'"" Thompson said that Alonso then agreed to turn over a copy of the recording or allow him and the housekeeper to listen to it but, more than six days later, had failed to do so. ""I am told by Mr. Alonso that the victim must now wait for the prosecutor's interpreter to prepare a complete transcript of it,"" Thompson wrote. He went on to complain that, within a few hours of that call, the New York Times reported on the ""alleged conversation with the incarcerated individual,"" in an article that cited ""'two well-placed law enforcement officials.'"" Thompson said he believes those officials work for Vance. The lawyer said he was troubled by the fact that, the following day, the newspaper ran another article about the alleged victim that described the reported conversation between the woman and the incarcerated individual. Thompson said the article used language similar to that which Alonso had used during their conversation. ""Such apparent leaks by members of your office is, without question, an abrogation of the duties and responsibilities of a prosecutor and will, unfortunately, have a chilling effect on other victims of sex crimes coming forward in the future for fear of reprisals from the office that is charged with protecting victims -- not discrediting them through orchestrated media campaigns,"" he wrote. Thompson added that he was ""truly saddened"" to read the response of a ""senior prosecutor"" who was asked about a New York Post article that asked whether the victim was ""turning tricks while at (a) hotel"" after the alleged sexual assault and under the protection of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. ""I can't say with 100% certainty that it's not true,"" the ""senior prosecutor"" was quoted as saying. ""The fact that apparently a prosecutor in your office suggested that it might be true that the victim is a prostitute and had engaged in acts of prostitution while under the protection of your office is appalling,"" Thompson wrote. He then pointed to what he said represents a potential conflict of interest that the prosecutor's office has in the case -- ""the chief of your entire trial division is married to one of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers in this case."" And he blamed the prosecution for failing to have alerted him before he learned of it from the news media. ""As far as we know, this prosecutor is still assigned to the case and gives us great concern about whether your office can truly determine what is in the interest of justice."" Vance's spokeswoman's response did not address each of the concerns raised by Thompson. It said, ""We strongly disagree with how the office and the work of the assistant district attorneys have been characterized."" Also Wednesday, attorneys for Strauss-Kahn said that the defense team had a ""constructive meeting"" with prosecutors, who maintained that they are not ready to drop sexual abuse and attempted rape charges even after questions were raised about the accuser's credibility. ""The investigative process is continuing, and no decisions have been made,"" said Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman Erin Duggan. The two-hour meeting came just days after prosecutors disclosed credibility issues regarding the hotel maid who accused Strauss-Kahn of sexually attacking her. ""We had a constructive meeting today with (Vance) and his colleagues,"" said a statement from . William W. Taylor III and Benjamin Brafman. Strauss-Kahn pleaded not guilty in June to charges that prompted him to resign from his post as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Questions about the case surfaced last week when Vance indicated that the woman, 32, had been less than truthful with authorities about some aspects of her life and her whereabouts immediately after the alleged attack at the Sofitel hotel May 14. Legal analysts suggest that prosecutors are looking for ways to salvage the case. ""Prosecutors correctly regard dismissal as complete humiliation and capitulation,"" said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""If they can get a guilty plea, even to a misdemeanor, that would be a slightly face-saving route out of this case. ""But it seems clear that the defense now very much has the upper hand,"" he added. The developments in New York come as Strauss-Kahn faces separate accusations of attempted rape in France, which were filed in a complaint by French writer Tristane Banon. A Strauss-Kahn lawyer in France said he has filed a counter-claim against Banon for ""false declarations."" French prosecutors have received Banon's complaint, a spokeswoman for the office said, and it is currently ""under consideration"" to determine whether there is enough evidence to press charges. Banon's mother, Socialist politician Anne Mansouret, said shortly after the housekeeper's accusations were splashed across front pages around the world that her daughter had been attacked by Strauss-Kahn in 2003 but that she had discouraged her at the time from filing charges against him. The statute of limitations in France for attempted rape is 10 years. Mansouret, a member of parliament, said she cautioned Banon not to file a police report at the time for fear it would hurt her journalism career.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson appeared to be dead when an ambulance arrived at his home at 12:26 p.m. June 25, 2009, according to a paramedic and a security guard who testified Wednesday. ""When I picked him up, his legs were quite cool,"" Los Angeles County Paramedic Richard Senneff said. ""His eyes were quite dry."" No pulse was detected, and the paramedics' heart monitor showed Jackson was ""flatlined"" as he lay on his bedroom floor, Senneff testified. Wednesday was the second day of testimony in a preliminary hearing to decide whether Dr. Conrad Murray will face trial for involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. Prosecutors contend that Murray's should be held criminally responsible for giving the pop star a surgical anesthetic, propofol, at home without monitoring equipment. The coroner concluded Jackson died from ""acute propofol intoxication,"" in combination ""the contributory affects of the benzodiazepines,"" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said. Murray allegedly delayed calling for help when he found Jackson was not breathing, misled paramedics and doctors about the series of sedatives and the anesthetic he'd given him and that he tried to hide evidence when he should have been trying to revive Jackson. Murray told paramedics he had only given Jackson a dose of lorazepam to help him sleep and that he was treating him for dehydration, Senneff testified. When he asked ""how long the patient was down,"" the doctor responded ""'It just happened,'"" Senneff testified. The paramedic, however, said ""it didn't add up."" Testimony Wednesday also included emotional accounts of crying and praying in the home as Jackson's children and employees realized something was very wrong upstairs. Jackson chef Kia Chase said the first indication of a crisis was when Murray ran downstairs in a panic and asked her to send Jackson's oldest son, Prince, and the security guard upstairs. ""His eyes were enlarged,"" Chase testified. ""He was screaming."" After the housekeepers started crying, the rest of the staff joined them, she said. ""We started praying,"" Chase said. ""We held hands, and we were crying."" Jackson's two oldest children, Prince and Paris, watched from a bedroom doorway as Murray tried to revive their father before the ambulance arrived, according to Alberto Alvarez, who worked on Jackson's security team. ""Paris screamed 'Daddy!' and she started crying,"" Alvarez testified. Michael Jackson's three sisters, parents and brother Randy listened from the second row of the Los Angeles County courtroom as Alvarez appeared to be near tears as he described the scene. ""Dr. Murray then said 'Get them out, get them out. Don't let them see their father like this,' "" Alvarez said. ""I turned to the children and I told them 'Don't worry, children, we'll take care of it. Go outside please.' "" Alvarez testified that Murray asked for his help in collecting medicines from around the bedroom. ""He then grabbed a handful of bottles or vials,"" Alvarez said. ""He instructed me to put them in a bag."" It was only then, about 21 minutes after prosecutors say Murray realized Jackson was not breathing, that he asked Alvarez to call for an ambulance. It arrived four minutes later. Jackson's former security chief testified that Murray seemed not to know how to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation as he waited for paramedics to arrive at the singer's house. Faheem Muhammed said he and Alvarez saw Murray crouched next to Jackson's bed ""in a panicked state asking, 'Does anyone know CPR?' "" ""I looked at Alberto because we knew Dr. Murray was a heart surgeon, so we were shocked,"" Muhammed said. When defense lawyer Ed Chernoff asked if perhaps Murray was only asking for help because he was tired, Muhammed said, ""The way that he asked it is as if he didn't know CPR."" Alvarez testified that Murray told him and Muhammed that he was inexperienced at mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. ""After the second time, he gave a breath, he said 'You know, this is the first time that I give mouth-to-mouth, but I have to do it, because he's my friend,' "" Alvarez said. Jackson appeared to be dead at that time, with his ""eyes open and his mouth open, just laying there,"" Muhammed said. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Walgren earlier said that Murray used ""ineffectual CPR with one hand while the patient was prone on a soft bed."" Using two hands with the patient prone on a hard surface is the proper method, he said. Muhammed, testifying Tuesday, said he never saw Murray performing CPR on Jackson before paramedics arrived and transported the singer to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. The hearing, which began Tuesday, is expected to last two or three weeks, with 20 to 30 witnesses testifying. Judge Michael Pastor will determine whether there is probable cause to send Murray to trial. Murray remains free on $75,000 bond.

"(CNN) -- Two leading tobacco companies fired a pre-emptive legal strike against federal authorities Friday, challenging the objectivity and thus validity of a 12-member advisory panel charged with making recommendations on the safety of menthol cigarettes and other matters. The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, which is helping direct the implementation of the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, is set to file a key report on menthol by March 23. Just over a month before that report comes out, R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard filed their lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, naming the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services and those agencies' respective leaders as defendants, as well as the director of the federal Center for Tobacco Products. The complaint attempts to prevent federal authorities from ""taking any action based on or influenced by"" or otherwise using information from the advisory committee ""as it is currently constructed."" That group, which includes three non-voting members representing the tobacco industry, is charged per federal statute with providing ""advice, information, and recommendations"" to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius on health, dependence and other issues related to tobacco. Theoretically relying on these recommendations, the secretary has the authority to mandate ""good manufacturing practices for tobacco products."" The lawsuit filed Friday questions the neutrality of the panel members, saying three -- including its chairman, Dr. Jonathan Samet -- had ""conflicts of interests and associated biases that are incompatible with (the committee's) role as an impartial advisor."" The tobacco firms allege that the three, plus two members of a subcommittee, have been paid expert witnesses in litigation against tobacco companies and/or consultants for pharmaceutical companies that create nicotine-replacement-therapy products. Jeff Ventura, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration, did not address specific claims in the suit. ""As a matter of general policy, the FDA does not comment on possible, pending or ongoing litigation,"" Ventura wrote CNN by e-mail. According to the panel's website, most of the committee's voting members ""shall be physicians, dentists, scientists or health care professionals practicing in the areas of oncology, pulmonology, cardiology, toxicology, pharmacology, addiction, or any other relevant specialty."" One must be a local, state or federal government official and one who is a representative of the public. Before the report's release late next month, the panel has two scheduled upcoming meetings. It has met approximately once a month since June 2010, with transcripts, webcasts and documents germane to the sessions posted on the FDA website. The tobacco companies in their complaint noted the panel's mission to probe menthol cigarettes, including their use among young people, African-Americans, Hispanics and other minorities, as well as smokeless tobacco products. Menthol cigarettes, which account for one-quarter of the cigarettes sold in the United States, have been under scrutiny by public health officials and public health watchdog groups. Critics claim the flavor makes them more addictive and they denounce the marketing campaigns that they say target menthol cigarettes specifically at minority smokers. According to a study published in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research, three-quarters of African-American smokers prefer menthol cigarettes to traditional ones. But Leonard Jones, director of marketing at Lorillard, said last year that ""ethnicity does not play a role"" in marketing strategies for the Newport menthol cigarette. ""We don't collect or retain information on ethnicity in our marketing data base,"" he said. R.J. Reynolds, the nation's second-largest tobacco company, is based in North Carolina and sells Camel, Winston, Kool, Pall Mall and other cigarettes. Delaware-based Lorillard, which ranks as the third biggest in the United States, is behind the Newport, Maverick, True, Old Gold and other brands. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: FDA spokesman says that the agency generally doesn't comment on litigation .

"(CNN) -- Suspected arson at the future site of a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, has ""really raised the fear factor"" among area Muslims, a representative of the mosque told CNN on Monday. The Saturday morning blaze destroyed an earth mover and damaged three other vehicles at the future site of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, said Camie Ayash, a spokeswoman for the center. The fire is under investigation, but ""you can reasonably make the assumption"" that it was deliberately set, FBI Assistant Special Agent Keith Moses said Sunday. ""The evidence is being analyzed to see what the origin of the fire was,"" said Moses, with the FBI's Nashville, Tennessee, bureau. ""We have to follow the facts."" Ayash told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday the incident has provoked mixed reactions in the community, but ""has really raised the fear factor for everyone. ... We see the different type of fear with our children. It is very hard to explain to children what is going on. It is hard to explain to the little kids when they ask you, 'Mommy, are these people for us or against us?' "" A candlelight vigil, organized by Middle Tennesseans for Religious Freedom in response to the alleged arson, was held Monday night in front of the Rutherford County Courthouse. Kyle Evans, spokesman for Murfreesboro Police, said about 100 people attended the vigil. He said a truck with three or four men drove up bearing a sign that said ""no mosque."" Joined by three or four other mosque opponents, the men debated with some of those at the vigil for about an hour, Evans said. Although voices were raised and there was some shouting, police did not interfere. ""We did not step in,"" said Evans. ""It was peaceful."" He added officers would have intervened if there were threats or physical altercations. The blaze is being investigated by the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office. ATF spokesman Eric Kehn told CNN on Monday night the investigation is continuing. ""We have no reason to think it's a hate crime,"" he said. ""We simply cannot allow the actions of a few destructive individuals to go overlooked by Rutherford County residents. It's truly a shame that we have reached this point, but it is up to us to ensure the intimidation goes no further,"" said Claire Rogers, spokesperson for Middle Tennesseans for Religious Freedom. Ayash said the Murfreesboro Fire Department told her the vehicles had been doused with an accelerant -- a substance, such as gasoline, that can help start or spread fires. She told CNN on Monday that she was notified of the fire about 4 or 4:30 a.m. Saturday. A passerby had seen the fire about 1:30 a.m. and called the fire department, she said. The lead detective told her that someone had opened the hood on the earth mover and set its engine on fire, she said. The other vehicles were doused with flammable liquid but not ignited. The detective speculated that the passerby might have spooked the arsonist, who fled, Ayash said. ""It really put fear into the community,"" Ayash said. ""Our children are heartbroken,"" she said. ""When we broke ground a few weeks ago, they could see the new Islamic center as something that was tangible, something that was going to happen."" ""Now someone had so much hatred to rip the joy out of their hearts,"" she said. The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro has existed in the Murfreesboro area for more than a decade, according to its website, and currently meets about a mile from the site of the future mosque. ""We have had members in our community in this area for around 30 years,"" Ayash said Monday. ""So all of this really took us by surprise."" The congregation purchased a 15-acre plot in 2009 and announced plans for a center that will include a mosque, educational facilities, a gym, cemetery and various recreational areas, including tracks, pavilions and a playground. The project has provoked controversy in Murfreesboro, about 35 miles southeast of Nashville, and statewide. In July, several hundred opponents of the mosque staged a march against the project. Some objected to Islam itself, carrying signs like  ""MOSQUE LEADERS SUPPORT KILLING CONVERTS,"" while others opposed the project for environmental reasons. Last month, Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey publicly criticized the project. ""You could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, a cult, whatever you want to call it,"" Ramsey, then a candidate for Tennessee governor, said at a rally. Ramsey placed third in Tennessee's Republican primaries earlier this month. ""I think a lot of this has to do with timing,"" said Ayash, who said her husband is a Muslim and she converted about 10 years ago. ""This was an election year. You had a lot of candidates running their campaign off of terrorism or things like that, so I think it had to do with timing and misinformation."" The community has an open-door policy, she said, and welcomes the opportunity to answer questions posed by members of the public about Islam.","NEW: Group holds candlelight vigil outside courthouse .

"(CNN) -- Fifty-seven ""militiamen,"" including several high-ranking officers loyal to militia leader Gabriel Tang, were killed when Tang's forces attacked the Sudan People's Liberation Army in Southern Sudan, officials said Sunday. Tang's forces launched the attack at Kaldak on Saturday, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) said in a statement issued on behalf of Gen. Malaak Ayuen of the South Sudan Army. The SPLA is the military wing of the movement that governs Southern Sudan. The SPLA killed 57 of Tang's forces, including three major generals and a number of brigadier generals, according to the statement. In addition, one major general and other brigadier generals were captured, the statement said. Tang himself ""narrowly escaped"" the fighting, according to the statement. Officials said it was unclear why Tang's forces attacked the troops, but the SPLA said it believes he has been in contact with other rebel groups in the region.

"(CNN) -- Embattled former district attorney Mike Nifong was held in criminal contempt of court and sentenced to one day in jail Friday for his actions in the flawed Duke lacrosse team rape case. Mike Nifong walks into the courtroom during his criminal contempt hearing in Durham, North Carolina, on Friday. Nifong must report to jail September 7, Superior Court Judge W. Osmond Smith III said. The judge said Nifong's withholding of DNA evidence from defense attorneys was an affront to the integrity of the judicial system. The evidence potentially would have cleared the three lacrosse players of sexual assault charges months before North Carolina's attorney general dropped them in April. The players initially were accused of raping an exotic dancer during a party last year. The specific evidence Nifong was accused of withholding was that DNA profiles found on the alleged rape victim were from unidentified males, but did not match any of the 46 lacrosse team members. He also was accused of telling the court in a September 22 hearing that a lab report contained complete information on DNA test results, when it omitted that information. Attorneys for the players contend Nifong became aware of the test results in April 2006, but collaborated with the director of the lab conducting the tests to produce a report that did not contain all the test results. Nifong also made ""multiple material misrepresentations to multiple courts on multiple occasions,"" the motion says. The defense team did not learn of the results until October. ""The court expects, and well it should, to be able to rely on the representation of lawyers,"" Smith told Nifong. Earlier Friday, Nifong testified in his defense, saying he and the lab director had agreed not to put the players' DNA profiles in the report out of privacy concerns, but said he thought the lab report was in fact complete when it was not. He acknowledged, however, that he had not read the report in its entirety before making the claim in court. ""All the statements that I made to the court ... I believed to be true,"" Nifong testified. He said it was his practice when prosecuting cases to turn over all his information to defense attorneys, regardless of whether it would help or hurt a defendant. ""There was no reason not to,"" he said. ""If there was a piece of evidence that helped the defendant, you had to turn that over anyway. If it was a piece of evidence that hurt the defendant, why not turn it over? Because he might realize at that point that it was in his best interest to take a plea."" Before Nifong was sentenced, another Superior Court judge, former Durham County District Attorney Ron Stephens, testified on his behalf. ""I always felt like I could take him at his word, his word was his bond,"" Stephens said. ""Basically, if he told you something, you could take it to the bank."" A disciplinary committee of the North Carolina State Bar disbarred Nifong in June, concluding after a hearing that he violated the majority of at least 19 ethics offenses in his handling of the case. The allegations against the players forced the cancellation of the Duke lacrosse team's season and cost coach Mike Pressler his job. The case also inflamed racial tensions in Durham. The three players are white, while the alleged victim is black. The three players -- David Evans, Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty -- initially were charged with first-degree kidnapping and first-degree sexual offense after a team party in March 2006. An initial charge of first-degree forcible rape was dropped in December 2006 after the players' accuser told prosecutors she could no longer say for certain that she had been penetrated with a penis -- one of the defining factors of rape under North Carolina law. The DNA issue also was a factor in eliminating the charge. In April, state Attorney General Roy Cooper dropped all charges against the three, saying the case was a result of Nifong's ""rush to accuse."" Nifong had asked Cooper to assign a special prosecutor to the case after the state bar filed its complaint against him.

"(CNN) -- Top seed Caroline Wozniacki and tournament favorite Serena Williams both came through third round matches in straight sets Saturday at the U.S .Open. Wozniacki, still seeking her first grand slam title, completed a comfortable 6-2 6-4 victory over America's Vania King. The Danish world number one will now play either former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova or Uzbekistan's Akgul Amanmuradova for a place in the quarterfinals. ""It's great to be through. I was fighting and getting a lot of balls back. It was windy out there so it was quite difficult to play,"" said Wozniacki, who has collected six tour titles in 2011. If the seedings go to form, she could face Williams, who survived a second-set fightback from fourth seed Victoria Azarenka before winning  6-1 7-6 (7-5) on Arthur Ashe. Williams, seeking a fourth U.S. Open crown, powered through the first set and looked set to complete a routine straight sets victory as she led 5-3 in the second. Azarenka had to save three match points on her service before breaking her American opponent to force a tiebreak. But Williams, seeded a lowly 28th after injury and illness, kept her nerve to go through. Seventh seed Francesca Schiavone from Italy is also through to the fourth round after coming from a set down to beat South Africa's Chanelle Scheepers 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, while Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro beat her compatriot Silvia Soler-Espinosa 6-0, 6-4.

"(CNN) -- The Dallas Mavericks took a giant leap towards this year's NBA title Thursday, as they swept aside the Miami Heat in front of their own fans. Dirk Nowitzki was again the hero, notching 29 points as the Mavs ran out 112-103 winners in Game 5 to take a 3-2 lead in the seven-game series. The giant German was one of five Dallas players to reach double figures for the evening. One more victory will see the Texans win their first ever NBA championship. ""We have to go down there (Miami) and basically approach Sunday's game as game seven,"" Nowitzki told reporters, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse. Meanwhile, Miami forward Dwyane Wade was forced to play through the pain barrier with a hip injury, but still managed to finish as the top scorer for the Heat with 23 points. Teammate LeBron James also caught the attention at both ends of the court with 17 points, including a triple double, and 10 rebounds, before he faded out of the game. However the visitors could not keep up with the pace as Nowitzki and Jason Terry in particular took the game to them. At one stage in the final quarter, the Mavs went on a 17-4 run. ""We've been waiting on an offensive night for us where we finally shoot the ball well, added Nowitzki. ""We felt like we had opportunities in the first four games, just couldn't knock anything down. So that was encouraging to see today that we made some shots."" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the team would be focusing on its inability to close out games. ""We haven't been able to do it consistently enough in this series,"" he said, in quotes carried by Reuters.com.

"(CNN) -- A Taliban insurgent with a rocket-propelled grenade has painfully brought back the question: Is the U.S. strategy succeeding in Afghanistan? NATO officials said it was reportedly an RPG that brought down a military helicopter carrying 30 U.S. service members, 25 of whom were Special Operations forces, on Saturday. All were killed in the crash, along with seven Afghan troops and an Afghan interpreter. It was the worst single-day loss of American life since the start of the war in late 2001. Army Lt. Jarrin Jackson, who spent most of last year in eastern Afghanistan, said he believes in the counterinsurgency principles pushed by Gen. David Petraeus, who is now director of the CIA. He even wrote an essay about it in the online publication Small Wars Journal. The strategy boils down to this: Insurgents rely on the fear and intimidation of local citizens to keep control, so the counterinsurgency focuses on protecting local citizens from the Taliban and rallying them to the Afghan government. ""I don't want to downplay the role of taking care of bad guys,"" said Jackson, who was based in Khost province, a stronghold of the Taliban that has plenty of insurgents. ""We took on a lot of rockets and mortars. But the majority of my time in Afghanistan, I was not under fire. I was interacting with people over there. The more you do that, I would argue, the better results."" Jackson believes interaction is imperative, even with the constant uncertainty of whether the person you're talking to is a good guy or a bad guy. ""One guy might be favorable one week,"" Jackson said, ""but because I stopped his car for my truck to get over a ditch, that prevented him from getting to the doctor's office ... (and) now he hates the government. It's incredibly fluid."" Khost province shares a border with Waziristan, the region of Pakistan that has been a safe haven for jihadists. The U.S. believes that Osama bin Laden hid there for years after the September 11 attacks, and it has recently been a testing ground for Petraeus' counterinsurgency tactics. Jackson tried to put himself in the Afghans' shoes. He said he can imagine how he would feel if his country were occupied for a decade by a foreign army dressed, as he put it, like ""automatons."" So he tried to play against it. ""You'd walk up to somebody and say, 'As-salaamu alaykum.' 'Tsenga yee?' It's kind of like 'What's up?' "" Jackson said. ""It's like 20 different ways of saying hello. I would walk up to an old man, shake his hand, look him straight in the face -- with my sunglasses off, so he could see my eyes -- and we would be shaking hands for probably one or two minutes."" Jackson didn't mind looking goofy, fumbling with the Pashto language or trying to tell a joke. He said he was trying -- and trying gets across in any culture, even when you're part of a foreign army. He says the human part of his job -- finding out what villages needed to prosper and keep independent of insurgents -- was a little like living in a small town. ""You know the people you go to church with. You know that Ms. Johnson's dog went to the vet last week and Mr. Steve had to have surgery. You know those intimate details."" In Afghanistan, Jackson said, ""I could tell you when one guy's crops were going to be harvested. I could tell you in this village, they'd go to this house to worship instead of the mosque, because it had better heat. I could tell you what time prayer was going to be and who went to that mosque."" Jackson had been in the country for 10 months when he went into one village he didn't know well. He did what he always does when he visits a new place: He and his Afghan counterpart told the locals that they wanted to talk to the most influential person in the village. Out walked a decrepit old man with a long beard. It took him 15 minutes to come out of his house and into the square. He had several wool blankets around his shoulders, and he was carrying a gnarled tree branch for a cane. He sat down and rested his hands on the cane between his knees. Jackson says he felt guilty for pulling the old man out of his warm house, but the man started talking right away. ""He said: 'I have a problem. I know I'm about to die. This village does not have any leadership set up to succeed me, and I'm concerned.' "" Jackson said. ""Then he just sat there looking at me."" Jackson said he wasn't sure what to think of a village elder asking for help from a foreign soldier. The elder told him about how Taliban insurgents had recently killed three of his villagers and left their bodies to rot as a reminder not to cross them. He also told him about other problems. All the time they were talking, Jackson said, he was trying to figure out a way to help. He knew he couldn't really help in the long term, but the elder clearly ""wanted some kind of answer, some kind of solution."" Then something came to Jackson. He remembered a village elder just to the north named Mohammed. U.S. and Afghan troops had cleared out Taliban insurgents there the year before, and the village was prospering. Jackson asked the old man whether he knew Mohammed. The man said that he did but that he hadn't spoken to Mohammed in years. So Jackson took a chance. ""I said, 'If you know this guy, and this guy is succeeding, and you're both village elders in eastern Afghanistan, why don't you talk to each other?' "" Jackson said. The old man looked at him as though the idea hadn't occurred to him, but he liked it, Jackson said. Jackson then went to Mohammed's village and asked Mohammed to help his neighbor to the south. ""I go: 'You see how safe and secure your village is now? How much safer, how much more prosperous would it be if the village just south of it were just as strong and secure and prosperous as yours?' "" he said. Mohammed said he would do what he could to help. As Jackson was leaving, he saw two figures heading toward Mohammed's village. One was a young boy. The other was the old man carrying his gnarled tree branch. Three weeks later, Jackson shipped out of Afghanistan. He said a small part of him wanted to stay to see how it worked out.","Winning civilians' trust is the key to the counterinsurgency, says one Army lieutenant .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona ripped apart Spanish title rivals Real Madrid to take top spot in La Liga with an emphatic 5-0 home victory in the first ""Clasico"" of the season on Monday night. Real coach Jose Mourinho suffered an embarrassing first defeat since taking over in May as defending champions Barca moved two points clear after 13 games following the Catalan side's fifth successive win over the capital outfit. The visitors were rocked from the outset as Xavi and Pedro put Pep Guardiola's team 2-0 up inside 20 minutes, then David Villa scored twice in four second-half minutes to effectively end the game before Jeffren's late goal just rubbed salt in Real's wounds. That led to Madrid defender Sergio Ramos being sent off after clattering into Lionel Messi and then shoving Barca captain Carles Puyol to the floor as passions boiled despite the cold, pouring rain. Was this the greatest Clasico of all time? ""One team played to their potential and one didn't,"" Mourinho told AFP after a miserable return to one of his former clubs. ""It was a defeat that we fully deserved but I don't think you can say it reflected the difference between the two sides. ""The championship isn't over today. We are two points behind the leaders but there are lots of games left to play. We have to show character, train hard and get back to winning. I wish we were playing tomorrow."" The most highly-anticipated match of the European season, it was a tempestuous affair that saw nine players booked before then, while Cristiano Ronaldo pushed Guardiola away on the touchline and Ricardo Carvalho escaped an apparent elbow in the face of Messi. Messi could not add to his hat-trick in the 8-0 thrashing of Almeria two weekends ago, but was a constant threat to a flimsy Real defense and he set up both of Villa's goals. Ronaldo is La Liga's top scorer with 15 after a treble last time out, but he was totally overshadowed by FIFA's world player of the year and was reduced to speculative long-range free-kick attempts. Barcelona's key midfielders Xavi and Andre Iniesta dominated possession, forcing Mourinho to take off one of his star signings, Germany's World Cup playmaker Mesut Ozil, at the halftime break. Can La Liga steal Premier League's Asian thunder? Messi hit the post as early as the sixth minute with a delightful flick, and Xavi opened the scoring four minutes later as he cleverly controlled a slide pass from Iniesta with his heel and guided a volley over goalkeeper Iker Casillas. The Real captain was caught out in the 18th minute as he let Villa's low cross slip through his hands to give Pedro an easy chance to make it 2-0 from close range. The match threatened to boil over after half an hour when Ronaldo pushed Guardiola when the coach refused to give him the ball when it went out, resulting in Barca keeper Victor Valdes charging out of his area as players from both teams clashed. Ronaldo and Valdes were both yellow-carded for their part in the melee, then Villa and Real defender Pepe followed them into the referee's book by the 36th minute. El Clasico the key to the title says Ronaldo . Messi was also cautioned just before halftime after he went to ground following an incident with Carvalho -- television replays showed that the Portugal defender was lucky not to be sent off after raising his arm into the Argentine's face. Mourinho brought defensive midfielder Lassan Diarra on at halftime, but just 10 minutes later Villa made it 3-0 as he beat the offside trap to collect Messi's clever throughball. The Spain striker doubled his tally in the 58th minute with a calm finish with the outside of his right foot after a superb diagonal pass from Messi left the Real defense in tatters. Mourinho responded by replacing leftback Marcelo with fellow defender Alvaro Arbeloa, before Carvalho was booked for handling when Pedro seemed set to run free on Casillas' goal. Ramos was yellow-carded in the 73rd minute, and received his marching orders soon after Jeffren beat him to a teasing low cross by fellow replacement Bojan Krkic to make it 5-0 in time added on.","Barcelona claim first place in La Liga with 5-0 demolition of previous leaders .

"(CNN) -- The man who composed the pop hit ""You Light Up My Life"" ended his own life Sunday, New York police said. Joseph Brooks, 73, was facing charges on 11 alleged rapes and sex assaults, New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. The Oscar-winning songwriter was found dead on a couch in his Manhattan home by a friend with whom he was supposed to have lunch at 12:30 p.m. Sunday, Browne said. A plastic dry cleaning bag and a towel were wrapped around his head, with a tube connected to a helium tank attached, he said. A suicide note was found nearby, he said. Brooks' son, Nicholas Brooks, was charged in January with the murder of his ex-girlfriend, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's office. The bruised body of swimsuit designer Sylvie Cachay, 33, was found at a chic New York hotel last December, police said. The song, which was written as the title track for a movie, won an Oscar, a Golden Globe and a Grammy for Brooks. Debby Boone's recording of ""You Light Up My Life"" was the number one song of 1977 on the Billboard pop chart.

"(CNN Student News) -- May 3, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Abbottabad, Pakistan • New York, The Pentagon, Shanksville . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CNN ANNOUNCER: This is CNN Breaking News. DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR, CNN NEWSROOM: We're being told by a White House official that the president will make a statement at 10:30. WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR, THE SITUATION ROOM WITH WOLF BLITZER: I'm told by sources it is a national security issue. JOHN KING, CNN HOST, JOHN KING, USA: CNN is told by several sources now that the president of the United States will announce in just moments that the United States has the body of Osama bin Laden. BLITZER: And now the president will tell us officially bin Laden is dead. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: That was the breaking news late Sunday night after we recorded yesterday's show. In today's special edition of CNN Student News, we're going in depth into the death of Osama bin Laden. First Up: Osama bin Laden Killed . AZUZ: He was a terrorist, one of the FBI's most wanted criminals, and the mastermind behind the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Now, Osama bin Laden is dead. Sunday, a U.S. military operation involving Navy SEALs assaulted the compound, this mansion, where bin Laden was hiding out in Pakistan. He and four other people were killed. U.S. officials say they've used DNA testing to confirm that the body is that of bin Laden. One of his wives also identified the body for U.S. forces. Obviously, a very significant moment for the United States and for people around the world. To understand just how big this news is, take a look back. Osama bin Laden had been a terrorist for decades. In 1988, he founded al Qaeda, which became a terrorist network three years later. In 1992, bin Laden was accused of sending some of his followers to fight U.S. forces that were in the African nation of Somalia. And a year later, a bomb exploded at New York's World Trade Center. Bin Laden was one of several people suspected of being involved. 1996: Osama bin Laden declared a ""jihad,"" or holy war, against U.S. forces. Two years after that, he was charged with the murders of 224 people; they died in the bombings at U.S. embassies in the African countries of Kenya and Tanzania. He appeared on the FBI's ""Ten Most Wanted Fugitives"" list in 1999. And he was linked to the bombing of a U.S. Navy ship -- the USS Cole -- that killed 17 sailors in the year 2000. September 11th, 2001: Osama bin Laden was behind the attacks that killed nearly three thousand people on U.S. soil. The events and images of that day seared into the memories of so many Americans. Four planes hijacked by al Qaeda terrorists: Two were flown into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in New York. Both of those would later collapse. Another plane crashed into the Pentagon, near Washington, D.C. And the fourth crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, in a field, after passengers fought back against the hijackers. It was, again, the worst terrorist attack ever on American soil. It led to the U.S.-led war on terrorism, the war in Afghanistan. And now, the man behind it, Osama bin Laden, is dead. The Operation Timeline . AZUZ: ""Justice has been done."" That's what President Obama said when he announced bin Laden's death. He also spoke about what this moment means for the United States. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11, that we have never forgotten your loss nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores. And tonight, let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11. I know that it has, at times, frayed. Yet today's achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people. The cause of securing our country is not complete, but tonight we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to. That is the story of our history. Whether it's the pursuit of prosperity for our people or the struggle for equality for all our citizens, our commitment to stand up for our values abroad, and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place. Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power, but because of who we are: one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. AZUZ: Former President George W. Bush, who was in office on September 11th, 2001, released a statement Sunday night about bin Laden's death. Mr. Bush said, ""This momentous achievement marks a victory for America, for people who seek peace around the world and for all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001. The fight against terror goes on, but tonight America has sent an unmistakable message: No matter how long it takes, justice will be done."" So, how did the U.S. find bin Laden? Jeanne Meserve details the events that led up to bin Laden's death. (BEGIN VIDEO) OBAMA: I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden. JEANNE MESERVE, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: U.S. officials say it began last August when new leads came to light about the possible whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. OBAMA: It was far from certain, and it took many months to run this thread to ground. I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside Pakistan. MESERVE: The key lead: tracking one of the few couriers trusted by bin Laden. Then, last Friday, President Obama authorized an operation to get the head of al Qaeda. That operation happened Sunday in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad. Bin Laden was in a large compound originally built on the outskirts of town, reachable only by a dirt road. Over time, more homes had been built around it. U.S. officials say the compound had 12-18 foot walls topped with barbed wire and what's being called extraordinary security. A third floor terrace had a seven-foot privacy wall. Only a small group inside the U.S. government knew about the operation carried out by Navy SEALs in helicopters. OBAMA: A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. MESERVE: The operation lasted about 40 minutes. Though a U.S. helicopter crashed due to mechanical reasons, there were no U.S. casualties. Bin Laden resisted the assault and was killed in the firefight, shot in the head. (END VIDEO) Reaction . AZUZ: As the news of bin Laden's death came out on Sunday night, a crowd started forming outside the gates at the White House. People turning out to celebrate the news. There was a patriotic spirit to the spontaneous gathering. Listen. CROWD: And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave. O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? AZUZ: Similar crowds at cities around the U.S. That includes in New York, where people gathered at Ground Zero, the spot where the Twin Towers once stood. The reactions weren't all celebrations, though. Gordon Felt is the president of the Familes of Flight 93. That's the 9/11 plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. Discussing bin Laden's death, he said ""it cannot ease our pain or bring back our loved ones. It does bring a measure of comfort that the face of global terror can no longer spread his evil."" U.S. and Pakistan . AZUZ: This is the compound, the mansion, where Osama bin Laden was found in Pakistan. It's in a city called Abbottabad, about 100 miles away from Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. There are some disagreements between the U.S. and Pakistan over how much info the Pakistani government had about the assault on the compound. But both countries agree that information from Pakistan helped lead U.S. forces to the place. The two countries agreed to work together to fight terrorists, but the U.S. and Pakistan have had some problems with each other recently. The United States says Pakistan hasn't been putting enough pressure on terrorist groups. Pakistan is angry about American attacks against terrorists inside Pakistani borders. Increased Precautions . AZUZ: One question that comes up is how al Qaeda might react to bin Laden's death. A U.S. official said the government expects threats of retaliation, pointing out that al Qaeda declared war on the U.S. more than a decade ago. Security was increased at military facilities around the country. More officers on patrol at the U.S. Capitol. American embassies in other countries put on high alert, and the government gave a travel warning for Americans overseas. Looking Ahead . AZUZ: U.S. forces took bin Laden's body out of that compound in Pakistan. Islamic law says the burial has to happen with 24 hours. Since there was no alternative on land, bin Laden's body was buried at sea. U.S. officials said they made all efforts to follow Islamic burial rules. But the death of bin Laden does not mean the end of the U.S.-led war on terror. Here's what Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had to say. U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: Even as we mark this milestone, we should not forget that the battle to stop al Qaeda and its syndicate of terror will not end with the death of bin Laden. Indeed, we must take this opportunity to renew our resolve and redouble our efforts. Goodbye . AZUZ: A historic moment for the United States in the fight against terrorists, and for people around the world. Global reaction is pouring in to us, and we want to hear what's going through your mind, too. You can share your thoughts on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com.

"(CNN) -- The European Union has barred the import of certain seeds from Egypt after Egyptian fenugreek seeds were linked to deadly outbreaks of E. coli in France and Germany. European officials have also ordered that all seeds imported from one particular Egyptian exporter between 2009 and 2011 be withdrawn from sale, tested and destroyed. The move follows a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report released Tuesday that concludes one lot of fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt and used to produce sprouts is the ""mostly likely common link"" between the outbreaks of E. coli in France and Germany. The import ban, which applies to all EU member states, extends to the end of October. The contamination of the fenugreek seeds ""probably occurred before the seeds left the importer,"" the European Commission cites the EFSA report as saying. That contamination ""reflects a production or distribution process which allowed contamination with fecal material of human and/or animal origin. Where exactly this took place is still an open question,"" the EFSA report said. The EFSA said it was continuing to investigate where the fenugreek seeds from the Egyptian importer may have gone and concludes that the number of EU states that have received ""parts of the suspected lots is much larger than previously known."" The EFSA report does not rule out the possibility that more than one lot of seeds may be implicated in the outbreaks. ""Tracing back the origins of the E. Coli 0104 contaminations in Germany and France has been a key priority for the EU from day one of the crisis,"" Health and Consumer Commissioner John Dalli said in a statement. The commission would continue to monitor the situation closely and would take additional measures if needed, he said. The recent European outbreaks from a strain of E. coli have led to 48 deaths in Germany and one in Sweden, the EFSA said, with 4,178 cases reported in European Union states, Norway and Switzerland. The outbreak in Germany spread in May, and French authorities reported an outbreak in the Bordeaux region on June 24, the EFSA said. The agency has offered safety advice for consumers. ""As seeds sold for sprouting are often sold as seed mixes and cross-contamination cannot be excluded, it is important that consumers are advised not to grow sprouts for their own consumption, and also not to eat sprouts or sprouted seeds unless they have been cooked thoroughly,"" its statement said. In 2010, the EU imported from Egypt about 49,000 tons of the types of seeds affected by Tuesday's decision, the European Commission said, with a total value of more than 56 million euros ($81 million). Most seeds for sprouting imported by the EU come from India and China, it said.","NEW: The European Union is banning the import of seeds and beans for sprouting from Egypt .

"(CNN) -- The hijacked jet planes that roared out of a clear blue sky one sunny September morning 10 years ago killed nearly 3,000 people, but the hurt they did spread far beyond the immediate death and destruction at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The damage was mental, psychological, even spiritual. And the death of Osama bin Laden at the hands of U.S. special operations forces may help to start some healing, said Christian and Muslim religious leaders, relatives of victims, and a generation who grew in the shadow of 9/11. Mixed emotions about bin Laden's death: How should we feel? ""There is a sense that justice has been done,"" said Joel Hunter, senior pastor of the 12,000-member Northland Church in Orlando, Florida, and a spiritual adviser to President Barack Obama. ""There is a scripture, Genesis 9:6, that says, 'He who sheds man's blood, by man his blood be shed.' There is a certain kind of sense of relief that that has been accomplished,"" Hunter said. ""This man was symbolic of much that threatened our country and our way of life,"" the pastor said. Hunter also cited the verse promising that ""those who mourn will be comforted,"" saying they might ""find some sort of solace in this event."" Americans take to the streets amid news of bin Laden's death . Those verses are much more relevant than Jesus' admonition to ""turn the other cheek,"" he said. Victim's dad: Why I'm not celebrating bin Laden's death . ""That particular scripture has to do with insult and not with self-defense,"" he said. The terror attacks that bin Laden authorized are ""not even in the category of forgiveness,"" so killing him ""really is in a category that, for 99.9% of Americans, would be beyond question ... the right thing."" Morally OK to cheer? Diana Massaroli, whose husband died in the World Trade Center, certainly has no questions about it. Michael Massaroli, 38, was working for Cantor Fitzgerald on the 101st floor of the North Tower on September 11, 2001, when a jet plane slammed into the floors beneath him. His body was never found. His son was 6 years old at the time. His widow has been grieving ever since. But early Monday, at ground zero where the towers once stood, she said she was finally experiencing some catharsis. ""I'm missing him, but I feel that justice has been done,"" she said, holding a picture of Michael. ""I feel some overall calm that I haven't felt in 10 years. I never thought it would happen... never thought it would give me a feeling of closure,"" she said. Now, she added, ""I feel better ... like I can start a new chapter in my life."" We celebrated 'the death of my generation's face of terror' Relatives of the victims are not the only Americans feeling relief Monday morning -- American Muslims also hope the death of bin Laden will open a new chapter in history. The 2001 attacks opened a ""wound has never quite healed,"" said Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, formerly of the controversial Park51 Muslim community center planned for lower Manhattan, not far from the former site of the twin towers. ""The killing of Osama bin Laden is a major milestone,"" he said. ""It expresses the sense that there is a sense of healing beginning to take place."" Far from New York City, American Muslim lawyer Asma Hasan agrees that Osama bin Laden wounded the country's Muslims, but is not sure his death with heal anything. ""The 9/11 attacks changed my life forever in a very challenging way,"" said Hasan, who lives in Denver, Colorado. ""It's 10 years later and people still question us"" American Muslims. ""We have all had to become ambassadors for our religion, we have had to condemn every terrorist attack or be labeled a supporter of terrorism,"" she said. ""None of us can be a quiet person that just goes to our jobs, we have all had to become multifaith activists who reach out,"" said Hasan, the author of ""Red, White and Muslim."" ""I don't think the death of Osama will change that,"" she said. Steve Bernstein, whose older brother, Billy, worked in the World Trade Center, said he was ""very elated"" at the news bin Laden was dead. ""We have been waiting for this for a long time,"" he said. ""I felt that it was just a great moment for the country."" He said the scenes of jubilation across the United States should not be seen as people celebrating somebody's death, but as a recognition that ""everyone feels that capturing bin Laden or killing bin Laden was something that needed to be done."" Bernstein had another brother who also worked in the World Trade Center but left to go to the bank just before the first plane hit. ""He said as soon as he saw it, he knew"" Billy was dead, Bernstein said. Unlike some others in the towers, Billy Bernstein did not call to say goodbye, Steve Bernstein said. ""We never heard from him,"" he said. Hunting down bin Laden at last ""shows the strength of America, shows we're not going to put up with it,"" he said, adding it would ""make the terrorists think twice."" Bernstein was ""a little surprised"" bin Laden was buried at sea immediately after his death, he said, fearing it would fuel conspiracy theories. But in the final analysis, he said, ""the world can feel a little bit safer right now."" Another 9/11 widow, Kristen Breitweiser, said the death of bin Laden would change the world. ""My 12-year-old daughter will wake tomorrow to a safer world, hopefully a more peaceful world. And that brings me a rare sense of relief,"" she said in a statement, adding that she was ""enormously grateful for the tireless effort and incredible courage and bravery of our counter-terrorism agents. There were also more raucous celebrations going on at ground zero, including groups of young local men waving flags and chanting ""USA! USA!"" ""It took 10 years, but the fact that it happened today, we're all rejoicing,"" one of them told CNN, adding that ""everybody in America"" was celebrating the death of bin Laden. In Oxford, Ohio, Miami University student Mike Chase celebrated by shaving a friend's hair into the letters ""USA"" with two red stars. ""The announcement means that when we set out to accomplish something we follow through. It's a great milestone on the fight against terrorism,"" the 21-year-old said. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association hailed the ""annihilation"" of bin Laden as ""triumphant news."" ""I would say, 'May God have mercy on his hideous soul,' but I don't think he had one,"" the organization's president, Jon Adler, said. ""As we draw near September 11 and mourn the loss of our loved ones, let this victory remind all that the indomitable American will stands strong and eternal."" CNN's Eric Marrapodi, Jason Carroll and Ali Velshi contributed to this report.","The Bible clearly justifies the killing of bin Laden, a megachurch pastor says .

"(CNN) -- Photographers are honoring one of their own with an online benefit sale Monday aimed at helping the children of South African photojournalist Anton Hammerl, who was reportedly killed in Libya in early April. The sale marks the 5-month anniversary of the death of Hammerl, who was last seen by fellow journalists on April 5, 2011, after being shot in the stomach by forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi. The online benefit precedes a memorial service for Hammerl on Thursday in London, said Bronwyn Friedlander, a family spokesman. Hammerl's remains have not been located, he said. The sale at http://www.friendsofanton.org/ includes images from some of the world's most renowned photographers, including Pulitzer Prize winner Greg Marinovich and National Geographic's David Burnett. Among those also donating pictures is photographer Manuel Varela, who goes by the name Manu Brabo, one of the last people believed to have seen Hammerl alive. ""What happened to Anton was horrific. I feel compelled to help his family in any way that I can,"" Brabo said in a statement. Hammerl, who holds South African and Austrian citizenship, was initially believed to have been detained along with Brabo and journalists Clare Morgana Gillis, a freelancer for the Christian Science Monitor, the Atlantic and USA Today; and James Foley of GlobalPost. When Gillis, Foley and Brabo were released along with British journalist Nigel Chandler, they contacted Hammerl's wife to tell her what happened, according to interviews they gave after their release to GlobalPost and the Atlantic. Gillis and Foley said in the interviews they were traveling with Hammerl, following then-rebel forces toward the frontlines near al-Brega, when they were attacked by Gadhafi's forces. The two said in the interviews that Hammerl was shot in the abdomen by Gadhafi's forces. They last saw him lying in a pool of blood as they were taken away, according to the interviews. Hammerl was a former photographer for The Saturday Star in Johannesburg. He had gone to cover the fighting in Libya in late March as a freelance photographer. Since February, the Committee to Protect Journalists has tallied dozens of attacks on journalists in Libya, including five deaths. Among those also killed were Oscar nominee Tim Hetherington and acclaimed photojournalist Chris Hondros, who were struck by a rocket-propelled grenade while chronicling the violence in the besieged port city of Misrata. The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented the deaths of 861 journalists over the past two decades. Of those, 150 were killed in combat. ""The only way to capture the truth is to get close to it, and sometimes journalists like Anton Hammerl end up paying the ultimate price,"" said Maria Salazar-Ferro, CPJ's Impunity Campaign and Journalist Assistance Program coordinator. The photos donated for the online benefit are a diverse mix that include a haunting black and white image of children fleeing fighting, a picture of an American soldier dragging a wounded comrade in Afghanistan and a candid photo of Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan with their interpreters at a summit in 1985. The money from the sale will be used for the education of Hammerl's three children, Friedlander said.","The benefit sale precedes a memorial service for Anton Hammerl .

"New York (CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that it will investigate what happened Monday night when a massive Air France jet clipped a smaller aircraft at John F. Kennedy Airport. The incident, caught on amateur video, shows the Air France Airbus 380 clipping the smaller plane,a Comair Bombardier CRJ-700, while taxiing to the runway for takeoff. CNN Correspondent Jim Bittermann, who was on the Air France flight headed to Paris, said that he felt a slight rumble -- akin to hitting a patch of rough pavement -- as his plane was moving on the ground Monday at about 8:15 p.m. The pilot then stopped the aircraft, which is regarded as the world's biggest passenger jet, and eventually fire department crews surrounded it and the other plane. The Airbus had 485 passengers and 25 crew members aboard when the incident happened. The Bombardier had 62 passengers and four crew members. No one was injured, the NTSB reported. The tail of Comair Flight 6293, a Delta Connection flight that had recently arrived from Boston, was struck by the Air France aircraft while waiting to park at the New York airport, said Delta spokeswoman Betsy Talton. When the Airbus abruptly flicked the smaller plane, it appeared to turn at roughly a 45-degree angle, according to amateur video of the incident. ""Send a truck. They just hit us,"" the pilot of the smaller jet calmly called out to controllers over the radio, according to a recording of airport radio traffic on the website liveatc.com. Looking out the window, Bittermann could see that the last foot or so of the Airbus 380's left wing had been damaged. The other plane also suffered some damage. ""You could see the part of the 380's wing hanging down from the horizontal stabilizer of the Delta jet,"" he said, having seen the damage firsthand from a seat on the larger plane's left side. The Federal Aviation Administration was notified about the incident, and Port Authority police detectives interviewed the pilots of both aircraft, the Port Authority spokeswoman said. Those on the Comair flight were later able to get off the plane normally, according to Talton. The Air France Flight 007 originally had been scheduled to take off at 7:15 p.m. for Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, according to that airline's website. But, after the incident, it turned around and all its passengers deplaned and picked up their baggage at the New York airport. Bittermann described passengers' mood aboard that flight as relatively light-hearted and calm after the pilot alerted them of what happened. The NTSB said it has asked for flight recorders from both airplanes and will also review air traffic control tapes and ground movement radar. CNN's Rob Frehse and Kate Bolduan contributed to this report .","NEW: NTSB will review voice recorders, ground radar in accident investigation .

"(CNN) -- Strong winds whipped up several wildfires in central Texas Sunday, threatening homes and forcing some residents to evacuate. The largest of the fires is in Bastrop County, southeast of Austin, said Lexi Maxwell, a spokeswoman with the Texas Forest Service. The blaze has so far scorched some 14,000 acres and is threatening about 1,000 homes, she said. It forced parts of state highways 71 and 21 to shut and additional road closures are expected, Maxwell said. Julian Ochoa, 23, was evacuated from a Bastrop subdivision Sunday afternoon. He said he grabbed his dog, a toothbrush, his birth certificate and a few pictures. ""It was like a storm coming through. You could smell the earth burning,"" said Ochoa, who doesn't know yet whether his home is OK or not. ""All of Bastrop is a giant smoke cloud."" Fires were also reported in Travis, Leon, Colorado, Burnet and Caldwell counties. About 190 homes were evacuated in Travis County. A spokeswoman at the American Red Cross said it had opened four shelters and anticipates opening more. ""They are coming in so fast. The intelligence is sketchy at this point. There's a lag of information,"" Maxwell said about the fires. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning Sunday across much of south, central and eastern Texas. A red flag warning means weather conditions -- mainly high heat, low humidity and strong winds -- pose an extreme fire risk. Sustained winds near 25 mph, with higher gusts, were forecast. Texas is currently battling its worst fire season in state history. A record 3.5 million acres have burned since the start of the season in November. CNN's Stephanie Gallman and Anna Gonzalez contributed to this report.","Parts of Texas state highways 71 and 21 are closed .

"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- Chris Carriger is a 6-foot-1-inch, 250-pound police detective who served four tours in Iraq with the Missouri National Guard. But even someone with that size and life experience is no match for an EF5 tornado, as Carriger learned Sunday night when one struck his house in Joplin, Missouri. ""My feet were actually being pulled in the air,"" Carriger told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""I was just trying to figure out what I was going to do to keep there, and (I) just kept grabbing for the first thing I had. And that was the (bathtub) faucet. And basically, some debris fell on me and kind of held me down."" Carriger's home was one of about 8,000 structures destroyed by the twister's swirling 200 mph winds, City Manager Mark Rohr said, citing a Federal Emergency Management Agency report. The devastation ""looked like some of the things I'd seen in Baghdad,"" Carriger told Cooper, recalling his stints as a military policeman who came upon the aftermath of several firefights. Although Carriger lost his home, in some respects he's lucky. His wife was away at work when the tornado hit, and the two dogs in the house -- his family Havanese and a black Labrador K9 from work -- safely rode out the storm in a closet. Beyond that, Carriger says he's fortunate to live in a community where so many people are reaching out to help each other -- especially the newly homeless. ""We're staying wherever we can find with friends,"" he said. ""We've had numerous offers. (Joplin residents') friends and family are opening their homes."" Even with his home in ruins, Carriger went right back to work at the Jasper County Sheriff's Office, paying forward the kindness he has been shown. Officers are patrolling the devastated areas and enforcing curfews while the fire department searches for missing people. ""There are other people out here,"" Carriger told Cooper. ""We've got to get these people help, too."" While many trials lie ahead for the people of Joplin, Carriger is encouraged by everyone uniting for the better good. ""The American spirit is there,"" he said. ""It's strong. We'll get through this. We just have to bond together.""","Chris Carriger's house was one of thousands destroyed by a tornado in Joplin, Missouri .

"(CNN) -- Complete this sentence: In the event of a loss of cabin pressure ... Air New Zealand crew members ""bared all"" for their preflight safety video to show they have ""nothing to hide."" If you guessed, ""oxygen masks will drop from above,"" you are not alone. Because the federally mandated preflight safety announcement is about as well known as the pledge of allegiance to many travelers, they immediately tune it out. So airlines are getting creative to grab passengers' attention. According to a 2001 National Transportation Safety Board study, 69 percent of passengers who completed the survey did not watch the entire safety briefing because they had seen it before or because they considered it common knowledge. How do airlines compete with more entertaining options, like texting or leafing through Sky Mall magazine? They are employing a variety of creative techniques, from naked cabin crew members to witty cartoons.  Watch videos of the creative tactics » . In late June, Air New Zealand rolled out a decidedly different approach to the preflight safety video for its domestic flights, and it doesn't leave much to the imagination. As part of its ""Nothing to Hide"" marketing campaign, which highlights the carrier's lack of fees compared with its so-called low-cost airline competition, the airline professionally body-painted five naked airline employees to perform the safety video with a pinch of cheeky humor, literally. ""We wanted to point out we have nothing to hide, and there are no surprises,"" said Steve Bayliss, general manager of marketing for the Auckland-based carrier. Set to a poppy song by New Zealander Gin Wigmore, the 3½-minute video debuted with much fanfare and a warm reception, Bayliss said. ""It was overwhelming, with 99.9 percent of the reaction positive,"" Bayliss said. ""What it has done for the airline was quite amazing. It was really innovative and shows we are up to trying new things."" Atlanta, Georgia-based Delta Air Lines made an attention-grabbing foray in May 2008 when it introduced a seductive flight attendant, nicknamed ""Deltalina"" by her fans because of her resemblance to actress Angelina Jolie, for its preflight safety video. The video has been viewed on YouTube more than 1.3 million times. But are passengers paying attention? While there is no hard data, Delta spokeswoman Susan Elliott says yes. ""We know they are paying attention because they are talking about it,"" Elliott said. ""The response from customers is overwhelmingly positive."" Delta will introduce a new version of the video in 2010 when the airline's merger with Northwest Airlines is completed. As for ""Deltalina,"" Elliott said only that she will ""very likely play some role"" in the new video. Companies must tailor their marketing efforts to our shrinking attention spans, said Larry Chiagouris, a professor of marketing at Pace University. Whoever delivers the most concise and compact information wins the consumer over, he said. ""We are now accustomed to getting our information fast and quick; as a result, we don't have the staying power to sit and listen,"" Chiagouris said. Cait Poynor, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Pittsburgh, said that as people's attention spans grow more divided, they can focus on only one thing at a time, making a company's goal to attract your attention more difficult. Poynor and Stacy Wood from the University of South Carolina are researching what companies are doing to draw people's attention to information they feel they already know. ""We don't pay attention because we already feel like we know everything that's being said,"" Poynor wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""We're unlikely to give our precious attention to that safety video."" As of Tuesday, Air New Zealand's safety video had racked up more than 4.4 million views on YouTube, giving the airline priceless viral buzz. But Chiagouris ""guarantees"" we won't see this type of buzz again for an airline safety video and believes that the standard preflight briefing won't be going away. Other airlines that have gone the creative route to spice up the monotonous preflight safety videos include Virgin America and its sister airline, Virgin Atlantic. They use sassy cartoons to explain the safety procedures. The short-lived carrier Independence Air employed celebrities and political pundits for its audio safety announcements. Southwest Airlines' flight attendants, who do not have video equipment on board, occasionally sprinkle their instructions with quips: ""If you are traveling with two or more children, please take a moment now to decide which one is your favorite. Help that one first, and work your way down."" In March, flight attendant David Holmes gained some fame when a passenger uploaded his preflight safety announcement rap. British charter airline Thomson Airways has kids brief passengers about safety requirements. Thomson said in a news release that its internal studies found a 15 percent increase in attention from passengers. Poynor said these creative methods will hopefully perk up passengers' attention spans. ""By doing this, they're hoping they can make consumers think, 'Hey, there might be something new here. I should pay attention,' and get just a little bit more of their resources,"" Poynor said. Bayliss, the Air New Zealand general manager of marketing, said companies need to adjust their marketing efforts, especially in the current consumer climate. ""The grand corporate brand is over,"" he said, referring to the buttoned-up appearance that airlines like British Airways uses. As for the future, Bayliss remained mum about what Air New Zealand will do next. But it's unlikely their employees will bare all again. ""If we do a plain old traditional video, our consumers will hang us up to dry,"" he said. ""The challenge is to come up with something to interest them.""","The preflight safety video may be too familiar to passengers .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian police trying to clamp down on demonstrations against President Hosni Mubarak early this year were told to use tear gas, but not automatic weapons or live ammunition, a senior Egyptian police official testified Monday at Mubarak's trial. General Hussein Saeed Mohamed Mursi was one of several senior police officials due to testify Monday. During his testimony, prosecutors attempted to cast doubt on Mursi's credibility, as he was in charge of communication between police forces on the ground. According to testimony, police were ordered to use police vehicles to disperse protesters, Egyptian state television reported. The judge was forced to halt proceedings several times due to chaos in the courtroom, according to Egyptian state TV. Confrontations between Mubarak's lawyers and the prosecution caused the chaos, victims' lawyer Amir Salim said on television. The bickering started when Mubarak's lawyers raised a picture of the deposed president, infuriating the victims' lawyers, the station said. Mubarak is charged with ordering the killing of protesters to quash the uprising in February that brought about an end to his 30-year rule. He faces a possible death penalty if convicted. Outside the courtroom, clashes broke out between police and families of those killed in the uprising that led to Mubarak's ouster. At least 22 people were arrested and 26 people were injured -- 14 police officers and 12 protesters -- according to the Interior Ministry and the Health Ministry. ""The policemen are beating us to please their commanding officers,"" said Amal Eid, sister of a teenager allegedly killed by police on January 29. ""They don't care about us or why we are even here. Nothing has changed."" Another man, Mohamed Yaseen, tried unsuccessfully to push his way inside court. ""There is no real revolution without bearing arms,"" he shouted. The clashes began when the families of those killed tried to push their way into Cairo's police academy, the site of the trial. Police used batons to beat them back. The family members, in turn, threw rocks and guard railings at the officers. Police chased the protesters and family members, beating some and arresting others. After the melee, riot police circled the entrance of the court and cut off access. A similar scene played out in August during a court appearance by Mubarak. The trial resumed after a nearly three-week recess ordered by Judge Ahmed Refaat in part to give officials time to review evidence in the case. Mubarak was wheeled into court on a gurney, flanked by nurses. It was his third appearance before Refaat, who ordered the trial closed in August -- a ruling partially imposed to protect potential witnesses. Egyptians got a glimpse of an ailing Mubarak during pre-trial hearings in August when he was wheeled into court on a hospital gurney and put in an iron cage -- a standard procedure in Egyptian criminal trials. Former Interior Minister Habib El Adly, a member of Mubarak's inner circle, is being tried alongside the former president on similar charges. Attorneys for El Adly petitioned the judge Monday to separate the cases. About 840 people died and more than 6,000 were wounded in the 18 days of uprising that toppled Mubarak, according to Amnesty International. In addition to accusations of ordering the killing of protesters, Mubarak faces corruption charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Also expected to appear Monday with Mubarak were his two sons, Alaa and Gamal. The two face corruption charges. They also have pleaded not guilty. The elder Mubarak is the first leader since this year's Arab Spring revolts to face a judge. Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was tried in absentia after he was deposed in January and fled to Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, Cairo's district courts have indicated they are considering filing individual charges against Mubarak for every person killed by his forces in the uprising. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Official: Police were told to use tear gas, not live ammunition or automatic weapons .

"(CNN Student News) -- April 25, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Yemen • Misrata, Libya • St. Louis, Missouri . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. BEN TINKER, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Hey there, everyone. Happy Monday, and thanks for tuning in to CNN Student News. I'm Ben Tinker, filling in today for Carl Azuz, who's got the day off. As we kick off the last week of April, we're going to get things started today in the Middle East. First Up: Unrest in Yemen . TINKER: There's a deal being discussed in the nation of Yemen that would remove that country's president from power. That's something protesters have been pushing for weeks. They've been marching through the streets, demonstrating. And in several cases, those demonstrations have turned violent, with fighting between protesters and security forces. The protests are centered around this man: President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who's been in power for more than 30 years. This deal, which was put together by a group of countries in that region, says that President Saleh has to step down within 30 days. It also gives him and anyone who served in his government complete immunity from prosecution. Thousands of Yemeni people are angry at the deal, especially because it offers immunity to Saleh. They also want him to step down immediately. But as of Sunday afternoon, President Saleh had not signed the deal, and government representatives insist he won't unless the opposition groups agree to it. Libya's Revolution Explainer . TINKER: From Yemen, we move west to the North African country of Libya and the city of Misrata. The battle to control that city has gone on now for seven weeks. Hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting between Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces and the rebels who want him out of power. Over the weekend, Libyan officials said they stopped their operations in Misrata, but a rebel spokesman calls that a flat-out lie. CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson, who's been covering the conflict in Libya, explains how we got to this point and what some of the potential outcomes might be. (BEGIN VIDEO) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Libya's had Moammar Gadhafi leading the country for almost 42 years, and there's been a push to see democratic change there. Although Libya is on Tunisia's borders, the revolution in Tunisia really came to its initial conclusion with the ouster of President Ben Ali, who took exile in Saudi Arabia. That really sparked the revolution that then took place in Egypt, on the other side of Libya. So really, it was these two events, on both sides of Libya, that then gave the confidence to the opposition. People want democracy. And people want the chance, now, to choose their own political leaders; to have political parties; in some cases, to have a voice in their own futures. It went from being a sort of an ""unarmed civilian against government"" situation that we saw in Tunisia and Egypt, into more of an armed rebel revolt against the government, which is where it is today. You have the rebels in Benghazi to the east. You have Gadhafi in his seat of power and with the support of a lot of the principle tribes of the country in Tripoli. And you have a siege around the town of Misrata, where rebels are surrounded by government forces and are being shelled. It's reaching a stalemate of sorts, but behind the scenes, there are political back channel talks that are going on. The foreign minister has talked about the possibility of an interim solution, being an interim government that would last for six months before elections. But at the same time, Britain, France and Italy are talking about sending advisers for the rebels, which potentially will stiffen positions, stiffen the Libyan government's position, and make it harder, potentially, to reach any kind of a deal. Two potential futures: one is that there is a cease-fire, troops on the ground to monitor a cease-fire, an interim government and, ultimately, elections. There's been a lot of blood-letting so far; it's going to be hard to walk away from this situation right now without further bloodshed. The other scenario is that both sides dig in deeper, refuse to negotiate, and there becomes a much wider-spread civil war in the country. (END VIDEO) I.D. Me .

TINKER: A tornado ripped across parts of St. Louis Friday night, and this is what was left behind. The twister and fierce winds were estimated at anywhere between 110 to 200 miles per hour. This thing damaged 750 homes, left tens of thousands of people without power. But incredibly -- thankfully -- there were no reports of any deaths or serious injuries. A local minister said ""buildings can be replaced, but lives cannot."" The tornado also hit the airport in St. Louis. No planes were able to fly out on Saturday, but this plane you're looking at was one of the first to take off on Sunday. Our Dan Simon gives us an inside look at the incredible impact this storm had on the airport. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN SIMON, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Airport security cameras show what it was like inside the moment the tornado struck. Right now, everything appears fine. Then the lights go out, debris starts swirling, TSA officers run for cover. Another angle in front of a food stand. Watch as this guy on a cell phone looks behind him and sees things are not normal. Seconds later, it appears this whole concourse is swept up by the powerful wind. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get out! Go back inside! SIMON: The aftermath: a scene of broken windows and an airport that has to be quickly shut down. One arriving passenger says he saw the wind actually force a plane to slide 20 feet from the gate. ROSS TAYLOR, PASSENGER: By the time we got to the terminal, lights were out, there was glass everywhere, it was just open. There was blood everywhere from where people had been cut. SIMON: The tornado ripped through nine separate communities, destroying dozens of homes. But amid all the devastation, mostly just minor injuries. Authorities credit that to people heeding the warnings. WES BROWN, NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE: And that was not only because we had a 34-minute lead time from the National Weather Service, but because our media partners carried that warning immediately to the public, and thirdly, that the public did what we have told them to do. SIMON: Still, with so many dislodged from their homes, the Red Cross opened several shelters. Back at the airport, crews began the tedious process of boarding up windows. Any glass that had a crack was taken down. Airport officials say most operations will resume when the power is restored. While the airline traffic may resume, the cosmetic damage you see here may take months to repair. Dan Simon, CNN, St. Louis. (END VIDEO) Shoutout .

Easter Celebrations . TINKER: In the Christian faith, those 40 days of Lent are a time for prayer and penance and a time to prepare for Easter. That holiday, of course, was yesterday, as many of the world's two billion Christians celebrated the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Services and ceremonies took place around the world, including at the Vatican, led by Pope Benedict XVI. During his Easter blessing, the Pope urged an end to the violence in Libya and other Middle Eastern countries. And the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia held its annual Easter Sunrise Service ceremony yesterday. It began with a prelude from the U.S. Navy Band, and worshippers also heard from the U.S. Army chief of chaplains. Nominate a CNN Hero .

"(EW.com) -- The most anticipated new TV series of 2011 really kicked off on Sunday as the four ""X Factor"" judges -- Simon Cowell, singer Cheryl Cole, record-label exec L.A. Reid, and, yes, Paula Abdul -- gathered to audition wannabe superstars in downtown Los Angeles. Before the judges stepped onto the stage of the Galen Center on the campus of the University of Southern California, the show's hosts, former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger and British TV personality Steve Jones, introduced themselves to the audience. ""You're all probably wondering, Who the hell is this douche?"" said the self-deprecating Jones, while Scherzinger danced around him. ""Steve's actually a great singer,"" Scherzinger said. ""You wanna hear him?"" The crowd cheered him on, at which point he offered to croon ... ""Back for Good"" by the very British group Take That. (Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Take That fan, but I think I could have counted on one hand the people there who had any idea of what he was talking about.) Unfortunately, it was then time for the judges to take the stage, so we didn't get to hear Jones' musical chops. ""You are going to be our fifth judge,"" Cowell told the crowd. ""You're here to tell us who you like, who you don't like. You can certainly be as badly behaved as you want, actually."" He then passed the mic to Reid, who introduced himself by saying, ""To be clear, I'm not the Randy of the panel. I don't say 'dawg,' but I do judge talent honestly. I'm brutally honest. And I may not even agree with what you guys think."" He then added with a smile: ""I've had more success at it than you."" (That was a very interesting foreshadowing of a battle Reid would soon have with the audience. But more on that in a bit.) It was then Abdul's turn. ""I'm thrilled that you invited me back,"" she said to Cowell. ""It's a blessing to be part of this. And I couldn't be more thrilled to have someone on the panel here also who has experienced what it's like to sit next to him... Miss Cheryl Cole."" EW.com: Steve Jones, Nicole Scherzinger set to co-host 'X Factor' The charming Cole then made her first statement to the audience: ""I'm going to love getting to know America, and I hope you like to get to know me too. You might have to bear with the accent just a little bit, but I'm sure you'll get used to it."" From a nuts and bolts standpoint, ""The X Factor"" looks kind of like ""American Idol,"" except with Pepsi cups on the table. (Cowell and Abdul seemed happy to be reunited: During one break he lovingly petted her hair.) But one of the biggest differences was apparent the minute the first contestants hit the stage. The first act to audition was a duo (though not a very good one), comprised of two twentysomething male friends. Reid was fairly tough right off the bat: ""It looked like you guys were having a good time,"" he said of their rendition of TLC's ""Waterfalls,"" ""but I'm not sure you're cut out for the big time."" The talent didn't look too promising from there. The first solo singer, a 52-year-old mom who butchered ""Wind Beneath My Wings,"" earned so many boos from the audience members (many of whom started singing ""Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye"") that the show's audience warm-up guy had to say, ""We're going to try and steer away from the negativity"" and ask them not to boo the contestants. But the real drama surrounded the eighth contestant, a 35-year-old female rapper/singer. After she performed a Jessie J-esque rap original called ""Cluck Cluck,"" the instant crowd favorite got a no vote from Cowell and yeses from Abdul and Cole, leaving her fate in Reid's hands. The mogul voted no, leading to loud boos from the audience. After she left the stage, crowd members chanted ""Bring her back!"" at which point producers had her walk back on the stage. The judges told her she had 30 seconds to perform something else. Her second number was even stronger, and led to an even more enthusiastic response from the crowd (who were clearly taking Cowell's ""fifth judge"" edict seriously). Said a defiant Reid: ""I'm changing my no vote, not because of them, but because of you."" The fact remains, however, that had the crowd not demanded she be given a second chance, she wouldn't have gotten it. (You'll have to watch the show when it premieres this fall to see if she officially made it through to the next round.) In all, Abdul and Cole were certainly the kinder mentors, while it's looking like it could be a battle between Cowell and Reid for the title of ""X Factor's"" harshest judge.

"(CNN) -- Environmental activist Philippe Cousteau is to explore the Arctic with CNN to show how scientists in the wilderness are studying climate change in one of the coldest places on the planet. For ""Extreme Science"" Cousteau will see first-hand how they operate in brutal sub-zero temperatures, severe storms and high winds, collecting data on water and ice while living in a tent village on the ice. And while he's there between March 23 and April 4 he'll try to answer your questions about life at the top of the world and how the work there can impact everyone's lives. Scientists are using new radar technology to measure the thickness of sea ice without the need to dig holes. Their work will try to determine just how fast the ice is melting and what will be the effects on weather patterns, ocean currents and marine life. Cousteau, grandson of the legendary Captain Jacques Cousteau, will be CNN special correspondent inside the Arctic Circle. He is the CEO of Earth Echo International -- a non-profit organization dedicated to educating youth about environmental issues. He is also co-founder of Azure Worldwide, a strategic environmental design, development and marketing company. Cousteau, 31, reported last year for CNN International on the Gulf oil spill and has hosted green-themed specials. He founded and co-chairs the Gulf Action Network for the Clinton Global Initiative and has testified to the U.S. Congress on ocean management and off-shore drilling. He is also chief ocean correspondent at Discovery's Animal Planet and hosted ""Ocean's Blue,"" a Discovery/BBC collaboration last year. Publications from ""Sport Diver"" and ""National Geographic"" have published Cousteau's stories from around the world.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Explosions and heavy automatic gunfire were heard hours after five well-armed suicide bombers attacked the British Council in the Afghan capital Friday, leaving at least eight people dead, officials said. White smoke billowed from a building in the compound while heavily armed British and Afghan forces cordoned off the area in the center of the capital, establishing a security perimeter around the buildings. The attacks occurred inside a well-guarded Kabul neighborhood, leaving at least 16 people wounded, the Afghan Interior Ministry said. Among the dead was one New Zealand Special Forces service member, officials said. ""I have limited details about the soldier's death, but I am advised that he died during fighting that followed an attack by insurgents in Kabul in the last few hours,"" New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said. ""On behalf of the government, I want to offer my condolences to the family of the soldier."" The strike, which the Taliban have claimed responsibility for, coincides with the 92nd anniversary of Afghan independence from Great Britain. Eyewitnesses: 'Whole house shaking' In the first attack, a militant drove a vehicle packed with explosives toward the Council's main security gate before detonating the device, according to Afghan police spokesman Hashamap Stanikzai. A second man then attempted to enter the compound wearing a vest filled with explosives. He also detonated himself, Stanikzai said. Police say two militants were killed in a firefight with security forces. The other three detonated their explosives. Gunfire could be heard throughout the incident, and military helicopters circled overhead. The British Council is a British government-affiliated body that fosters cultural and academic exchanges in Afghanistan. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack, as did the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. ""Initial reports indicate a combination of multiple vehicle-borne and personal-borne (improvised explosive devices) were detonated,"" the ISAF statement said. NATO commander Gen. John Allen pledged to hold ""the perpetrators accountable for their actions."" Meanwhile, an embassy spokesman said British government personnel are coordinating with Afghan authorities to secure the area. The strike occurred not far from the Intercontinental Hotel, the scene of another insurgent attack against a high-profile Western target in June. CNN's Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.","NEW: New Zealand premier offers condolences to family of slain service member .

"New York (CNN) -- Rafael Nadal had a scary moment Sunday when he slumped over in pain during a news conference following his third-round match at the U.S. Open in New York. The 25-year-old Spaniard -- the No. 2 in the world -- leaned his head back in the middle of the news conference, breathing heavily and grimacing in pain before slumping in his chair and lowering himself to the ground. Minutes later, he was on his feet again, smiling. Nadal attributed the pain to leg cramps after playing in hot, humid weather, according to the tournament's website. ""I just have cramping in my leg. That's all,"" Nadal told CBS after the incident. ""I just have cramping in front and behind. That's why (it) was so painful.""

"(CNN) -- In true finale form, this week's testimony was emotional, drama-filled and, thanks in part to a spectator who made an obscene gesture at prosecutor Jeff Ashton, not without a few surprises. Even the weather set the tone, storming so loudly on Friday that the thunder could be heard inside the courtroom. After 33 days and more than 100 witnesses, the murder trial of Casey Anthony is inches from its end -- only Sunday's closing statements remain before the jury deliberates. On Thursday, the defense wrapped up its case after calling to the stand every member of the Anthony family this week except for Casey. She only made a cameo when she personally addressed the judge to answer one of the trial's biggest questions -- whether she would testify. She declined the opportunity to testify in her defense. Prosecutors allege that Anthony, 25, killed her daughter Caylee in 2008 by rendering her unconscious with chloroform, putting duct tape over her nose and mouth so she would suffocate, or a combination of the two acts. They also allege that Anthony stored the body in the trunk of her car for days before dumping it in the woods. Anthony faces seven counts, including first-degree murder, in the death of Caylee, whose remains were discovered in a wooded field in December 2008. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. Anthony pleaded not guilty, and her defense team asserts Caylee accidentally drowned in a pool in June 2008 at the Orange County home that Anthony shared with her parents. The defense team has argued that Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked on discovering the body and covered up her death, though George Anthony has denied that scenario. Caylee was not reported missing to police until July 15, 2008 -- 31 days after she was last seen alive. Casey's father, George Anthony, was a key player in the defense's final testimony, taking the stand twice during the final week. On Tuesday, he denied an affair with Krystal Holloway, a one-time volunteer in the search to find Caylee and the woman who claims George Anthony told her Caylee's death was an accident. George Anthony said his relationship with Holloway was platonic, and he only visited her apartment because she told him she had a brain tumor and needed someone to comfort her. Holloway testified the following day, retelling a conversation she alleges she had with George Anthony. ""He said it was an accident that snowballed out of control,"" Holloway said. ""But I was caught off guard with it and by the time I looked up he had tears in his eyes, and I didn't say anything after that."" Holloway stood by her version of the conversation even when Ashton, the prosecutor, confronted her with the differing statement she gave to police. She told police George said, ""I really believe that it was an accident, and it just went wrong and she tried to cover it up."" On Wednesday, questioning of George Anthony turned combative when lead defense attorney Jose Baez suggested he feigned support for Casey in jailhouse conversations while pointing the finger at her behind her back. George Anthony admitted he pulled Orange County detective Yuri Melich aside on July 15, 2008, the first night law enforcement visited the Anthony home. He admitted he told Melich the car smelled like decomposition and that his daughter was lying. ""Casey was the last one that I saw with Caylee,"" he responded angrily to Baez. ""One and one adds up to two, sir, in my mind, and no matter how you're trying to spin it I'm upset because my granddaughter is missing."" Wednesday also brought George Anthony's second denial of accusations that he molested his daughter as she was growing up, and a full breakdown when he recalled the day Caylee's remains were found. ""[I felt] a deep hurt inside, tears, the whole gambit of such an emotional loss, seeing what my wife went through, what my son went through,"" he said through sobs. The defense also suggested Wednesday that George Anthony attempted to take his own life in a hotel room in 2009 because he was overcome with guilt. He admitted he consumed a mixture of pills and alcohol because he ""wanted to be with Caylee."" In rebuttal, the state introduced into evidence George Anthony's eight-page suicide note, full of praise for his wife, longing for Caylee and lots of outstanding questions. ""I sit here falling apart, because I should have done more,"" he wrote. ""She was so close to home, why was she there? Who placed her there? Why is she gone? Why?"" Prosecutors argue these questions about her death prove George Anthony did not know how Caylee died, contradicting the defense's allegations that Caylee drowned and he helped cover it up. In the note, George Anthony also seems to express uncertainty about Casey. He closes the letter by saying, ""I Love you - Cynthia Marie...Caylee Here I come...Lee, I am sorry...Casey --"" In a move the defense hoped would highlight the Anthony family's dysfunction, the defense called Cindy Anthony, who during direct examination agreed she testified six months ago that she thought Caylee was still alive. ""There was still a part of me that believed Caylee was alive at that time,"" she said Wednesday. Cindy Anthony also played a role in the defense's unexpected final line of questioning -- the manner in which they buried their family pets over the past two decades. During testimony from George, Cindy and Lee Anthony, the defense suggested Caylee was disposed of in the same way the family buried their pets, wrapped in a blanket and placed in garbage bags secured with duct tape. During cross examination, prosecutors pointed out that Casey Anthony was also privy to the family's burial techniques. The defendant was in high school when their last pet died. Highlights of the week also included testimony from Anthony's former fiance, which the jury will never hear. With the jury out of the room, Jesse Grund testified that Anthony told him she was molested by her brother. ""She told me at one point in recent years that she woke up one night with Lee standing over her in bed asleep,"" Grund said outside the jury's presence. ""And in another instance was groping her in the middle of the night."" Judge Belvin Perry ruled the testimony was hearsay, and it was not admitted. Roy Kronk, the meter reader who discovered Caylee's body, also took the stand this week. Baez alleged in opening statements that Kronk is a ""morally bankrupt person who took Caylee's body and hid it."" Kronk denied moving the body or touching it before December of 2008, saying he spotted what he thought was a skull in August of 2008. After several unsuccessful attempts to direct police to what he thought could be the remains, he left the matter alone until December when he returned to the same area. ""I still didn't think it [the skull] was real so I very gently took it [the meter stick] and put it into the right eye socket and I gently picked it up,"" Kronk said describing the moments before he called police. ""I looked down and I realized what it was and I set it down as gently as I could."" The week came to a close Friday with the state's rebuttal. Witnesses included Cindy Anthony's former supervisor, who testified company records show Cindy Anthony was at work during the times the defendant's mother claims she was searching for ""chlorophyll"" on the family computer. Earlier, a computer forensics expert had testified that he found searches for ""chloroform"" among the computer's deleted files, but no searches for ""chlorophyll."" Court will resume Sunday with closing arguments. The jury is expected to begin deliberations Sunday evening. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

"(CNN) -- A potential salmonella outbreak has prompted a multi-state recall of sprouts, an Idaho food company announced Friday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration made a formal recall request Monday, urging on its website that people not eat alfalfa or spicy sprouts from Evergreen Fresh Sprouts. The federal agency noted that the salmonella Enteritidis pathogen is different from the E. coli bacteria that has been blamed for at least 47 deaths, and widespread recalls, in Europe. The next day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on its website there had been 21 reported cases of salmonella tied to the sprouts, which are also labeled as Evergreen Produce. Nine of those were in Washington state, seven in Montana, three in Idaho, one in North Dakota and one in New Jersey. Three of those people have been hospitalized, and there have been no deaths, according to the CDC. Those affected, ranging in age from 12 years old to 77 years old, fell ill between April 12 and June 7. A vast majority, 77%, of those who became sick were female, according to the CDC. The recalled sprouts were delivered to four distributors and three retail stores in Idaho and Washington state, Evergreen said in its press release Friday. They include 4-ounce, 16-ounce and 5-pound bags of alfalfa sprouts, plus 4-ounce and 16-ounce bags of spicy sprouts. The expiration dates for all the affected products are between June 22 and July 14. Evergreen said that authorities determined that all those who fell ill with the salmonella had eaten its sprouts. But the Moyie Springs company said that tests on its products are still pending, and no products have come back positive yet. According to its website, Evergreen has been family owned and operated since 1990. Besides vegetables, it also distributes fruits, dairy items, pastas and a host of other food products.","Evergreen Produce issues a voluntary recall of alfalfa and spicy sprouts .

"(CNN) -- American Webb Simpson capitalized on a last-hole collapse from compatriot Chez Reavie to win the Deutsche Bank Championship on Monday. Reavie, 29, held a one-shot lead heading into the par-five 18th hole at TPC Boston, but he hit his first bogey of the final round to hand Simpson the chance to force a playoff. Simpson, 26, then sunk a 30-foot putt to draw level with Reavie on 15-under-par, before carding two birdies in the playoff to clinch his second tournament victory in three weeks. The win lifted Simpson to the top of the FedEx Cup standings, with two tournaments remaining in the season-ending series. The North Carolina native's August victory at the Wyndham Championship in his home state was his first PGA Tour triumph, but he said his previous success did not make his duel with Reavie any easier. ""I told somebody early this week that I feel like next time I was in contention, it'll be a lot easier than Greensboro,"" Simpson, who is ranked 14 in the world, told the PGA Tour's official web site. ""And it wasn't that way at all. It was just as hard. The shots and the putts were just as hard. I think it helped calm me down a little, but it was like I had never won a golf tournament before."" Reavie was disappointed to see his hopes of a second Tour win slip away, although he was pleased with the form he had displayed in the tournament. ""Unfortunately, my wedge didn't quite work out,"" Reavie said. ""But all in all on the day, I played fantastic.""

"(CNN) -- At his heaviest, Brent Schmitt weighed 419 pounds. Even at  6 feet 3 inches tall, that was very overweight and he had high blood pressure. Many people in his family -- aunts, uncles and grandparents --suffered from diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease and high blood pressure. The iReporter's life-changing moment came during an intense family discussion back in 2009 about his relatives' ailments. It finally clicked for him: It was time for him to take a different path. ""If I didn't do something about my health, then I was concerned I'd never live long enough to get married and have children or be healthy enough to spend quality time with my future family,"" the Evansville, Indiana, man said. And in 15 months, he dropped 177 pounds, more than 40 percent of his body weight. View Brent Schmitt's iReport . Starting a family is important to this 27-year-old civil engineer and he didn't want to miss out on this opportunity, or the chance to lead a healthy life. Schmitt jump-started the first six months of his weight loss journey back in July  2009 by reducing his food portions. He would use a smaller dinner plate than in the past and fill it with what he wanted to eat. Once he had done this, he would take half the food off his plate and just consume that portion. As part of his diet, Schmitt avoided processed foods. ""I tried to buy fresh fruit and vegetables every three days, along with lunch meat sliced from the deli section of my local grocery store,"" he noted. Schmitt focused on moving more, too. During the first six months of his weight loss plan, he made the daily choice of moving his body more than he had in the past. He would do little things like take the stairs rather than the elevator - or head to the copy machine after printing a work document, instead of letting his copies stack up. Once he hit the six-month mark of his lifestyle change, he added more rigorous activity to his daily routine, like using the treadmill. At first, he just walked on the treadmill, but over time he picked up his pace and started to run. In October 2010, he reached a milestone, running the Evansville half-marathon in less than two hours. ""At first I was in disbelief that I finished, and then I was relieved and proud of myself for achieving a difficult goal,"" he said. He now makes a point to take the longest route possible when walking somewhere in order to get more exercise. ""It's everyday choices like these that help me lose weight,"" he added. It took Schmitt about six and a half months to lose his first 100 pounds and then he shed the last 77 pounds over the next eight and a half months. He hopes to eventually reach his goal weight of 230 pounds. Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's Diet and Fitness expert who's a physician nutrition specialist who practices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California,  said Schmitt has shed his weight in a safe and effective manner and she salutes him for making smart choices. ""He didn't do any crazy diets or jump into a crazy exercise schedule - and he focused on proper nutrition,"" Jampolis said. ""His story just proves that in real life, if you make small choices like these day after day, it can end with tremendous results."" Schmitt's family doctor, Dr. Michael Allen, said he was comfortable with the pace of the weight loss, since he was a young male and didn't have  major health issues, beyond his high blood pressure.  Allen noted if Schmitt hadn't dropped the pounds, he would have been on his way to bigger health problems, including diabetes or possible knee replacement surgery. Many people who have not seen Schmitt in a long time  often do not recognize him, since his looks have dramatically changed. Many will ask him which diet plan he used or if he had bariatric surgery. ""I have to constantly reinforce the fact that it was a lifestyle change for me, and not a fad diet or surgery that caused me to lose so much weight,"" he added. Schmitt credits his family and friends for supporting him through his ""lifestyle change."" He says on days when he felt like he was struggling, they would remind him of his progress and how proud they were of him. ""They encouraged me to keep going,"" he said. Schmitt said his family members, with their various health issues, have closely watched his transformation, and he hopes his new healthy life will inspire them to make their own changes one day. Schmitt's goal of starting his own family is on track, too. In mid-June, he became engaged and plans to marry his fiancée in November 2012. ""Life is good for me right now and the future is bright,"" said Schmitt. ""I feel healthier, have more energy, more self-confidence and feel as though I have accomplished something really great.""","CNN iReporter Brent Schmitt shed 177 pounds in 15 months .

"(CNN)  -- Five-time U.S. Open winner Roger Federer battled past Marin Cilic of Croatia to reach the last 16 of a grand slam for the 30th straight time Saturday. 27th seed Cilic took the second set but the Swiss maestro then took command and ran out a 6-3 4-6 6-4 6-2 winner at Flushing Meadows. Cilic, who had thrashed Bernard Tomic in the second round, looked set to cause an upset until 4-4 in the pivotal third set. Facing a break point, he was warned for taking too much time between points and promptly served a double fault. Federer duly served out for the set and waltzed through the fourth. ""Coming in I knew it was going to be tricky and I'm happy that I was able to counter his pace and his good play,"" he told gathered reporters after his win. ""It was a tricky match, especially at one set all. At the beginning of the third set I thought that was a key moment because he had momentum on his side."" In later play, in-form Mardy Fish maintained his impressive run with a straight sets win over dangerous outsider Kevin Anderson of South Africa, 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-3). Fish is the highest ranked American left in their home grand slam in New York. But Czech ninth seed Tomas Berdych and Marcel Granollers, the 31st seed from Spain both had to quit their third round matches through injury. It takes to 10 the number of players who have withdrawn through injury in the men's singles, with four going in the women's. In Saturday's night session, world number one Novak Djokovic -- who has lost just twice in 2011 -- defeated Russian Nikolay Davydenko 6-3 6-4 6-2 to set up a last 16 clash with Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov. The Australian Open and Wimbledon champion had only dropped three games in his first two matches, but he was given a sterner test against Davydenko, a semifinalist here in 2006 and 2007. Djokovic told reporters: ""I played well at important moments and got the crucial breaks in all three sets.

"Otsuchi, Japan (CNN) -- Kyoko Ogawa wore the brave face the world associated with Japan's tsunami survivors. The March 11 catastrophe washed away all her earthly possessions. She watched as her hotel burned to the ground in a gas explosion triggered by the tsunami; a hotel that had been in her family for generations. She was determined not to let the disaster break her. But after the elation of finding her son alive, the reality of losing her livelihood started to erode the calm facade. She was in turmoil. She was afraid to talk to other people about it because she knew everyone was suffering as much as her, if not more. They were ""ganbaru,"" she recalls -- enduring, holding on, withstanding, and living with the pain. She couldn't be the only one to lose control. ""I was in shock because I realized that all that was precious to me was gone,"" she says, six months on from that terrible day. ""I didn't know what to do from then on. I became tormented."" That was the start of a slippery slope down a dark trail of despair. It's a familiar story in Otsuchi, northeastern Japan, where the devastating earthquake and tsunami turned much of the town in Iwate Prefecture into rubble. Today, much of that physical debris has been cleared away. But the emotional wreckage of the survivors is proving much more difficult to remove, as the mental scars from that day linger months later. In Ogawa's case, depression could have had tragic consequences for her had she not met Suimei Morikawa, a volunteer psychiatrist who listened patiently to her troubles one day at an evacuation center. Morikawa became the difference between life and death. She says she probably would have ended her life if the doctor hadn't been there for her. ""I was so moved by her approach to life,"" recalls Morikawa. ""She may have been suffering and wanting to end her life because she had lost so much, but she also desperately wanted to get over that. I was moved by her willingness to get out of her own situation. I just helped her a little."" Concerns about suicide and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are growing among mental health specialists working in the region. PTSD in particular, a condition which can push people over the edge if not addressed, can show up months after the initial shock. Suicide is also a major concern in Japan. According to the World Health Organization, Japan has the fifth highest suicide rate in the world. More than 30,000 suicides are reported each year, according to the country's national police agency, with Iwate Prefecture -- one of the regions hit hardest by the tsunami -- having one of the biggest problems. Mariko Ukiyo, a psychologist and volunteer counselor, is part of a therapy group called ""Team Japan 300."" She and a number of other team members visit temporary villages in the devastated region hoping to treat symptoms of PTSD and ultimately prevent suicides. According to Ukiyo, loneliness and despair take hold when the survivors move from their evacuation center to temporary housing. ""It is only then that people see how their life has changed from their pre-disaster life,"" she says. ""The sense of loss and deep grief can overcome you quickly and if you are alone when that happens, you lose all hope for the future. I think this period is when they need help the most."" But getting help to the victims is proving to be a challenge in Japan, a country with limited experience in mental health care historically. Ukiyo says the amount of psychological support received by tsunami victims now is a tenth of what the victims of 9/11 in the United States experienced. According to Ukiyo, the devastating 1995 earthquake in the city of Kobe started to raise awareness about the effects of post-traumatic stress -- particularly among the younger generation -- but many Japanese continue to find it difficult to talk about sorrow and loss because of the shame of appearing weak. Ukiyo's strategy is to gather the residents in temporary housing for a regular get-together in a relaxed atmosphere. This gives her the opportunity to keep an eye on each of the participants, observing anyone that shows signs of severe distress. The hope is that what starts out as small talk will gradually evolve into people talking about themselves and their problems. But despite her efforts Ukiyo is not optimistic about the region's future with trauma. ""We are only now starting to hear about sick or depressed people six months after the tsunami,"" she says. She believes suicide rates will only increase. Meanwhile, Kyoko Ogawa vows not to be another victim. She says Dr. Morikawa pulled her back from the brink and she is now making plans for the future. She wants to rebuild her hotel and give back to those who helped her. While Ogawa is a success story for Morikawa, he worries about those he will never reach in this devastated region. ""Now that I have met these people, I have grown attached to them,"" he says. ""It saddens me that there are still so many people suffering here. I can't stand the thought that there may be people who died because they had no-one to talk to.""","Kyoko Ogawa became depressed after losing her hotel in March tsunami .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Two Libyan convoys have passed through Niger this week, officials there said Tuesday -- fueling renewed speculation about the whereabouts of ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. One convoy was on its way Tuesday to Niger's capital, Niamey, said a Nigerien military captain. Another convoy reached Niamey a day earlier, a Nigerien Interior Ministry official said.  That convoy included six high-ranking Libyan officials close to Gadhafi, including Gen. Mansour Daw, the source said.  Daw is said to be the head of the Revolutionary Guard and is responsible for the security of Gadhafi and his family. The sources did not want to be identified because neither is authorized to speak to the media. Niamey is in Niger's southwest corner, near Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso's government told CNN Tuesday that it has not offered Gadhafi asylum, contrary to news reports. If Gadhafi were to enter the country, Burkina Faso would ""respect our obligation in the context of the International Criminal Court,"" said government spokesman Alain Edouard Traore. Gadhafi, his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and the former head of military intelligence, Abdullah Al-Senussi, face charges in the ICC at The Hague for crimes against humanity related to the regime's violent crackdown against anti-government protesters.  The court issued warrants for their arrests. Niger and Burkina Faso are signatories to the Rome Statute, meaning they recognize the court's authority. In August, Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Yipene Djibril Bassolet announced that his country was recognizing the rebels' National Transitional Council as Libya's government.  When asked what would happen if Gadhafi came to the country, Bassolet responded that Gadhafi could come, but that the government would respect its ICC obligations, Traore said. The African Union has called on its member states -- which include Burkina Faso -- to refuse the ICC arrest warrants.  In July, the AU called on the U.N. Security Council to activate Article 16 of the Rome Statute, which prevents any investigation or prosecution for a year. The AU argued that the ICC arrest warrants seriously complicated efforts to find a negotiated political solution in Libya. Traore told CNN that despite the AU postion, Burkina Faso would ""respect our obligation in the context of the ICC."" An AU representative could not be reached immediately on Tuesday. Gadhafi has historically been a strong supporter of the African Union and has channeled large sums of money its way. Traore said Gadhafi was not in his country, and that the Burkina Faso government was not expecting Gadhafi and doesn't know where he is. Abdallah Kenshil, chief negotiator for the National Transitional Council, said Tuesday a convoy left the pro-Gadhafi stronghold of Bani Walid three days ago. ""We believe that Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was part of that convoy,"" Kenshil said. NATO said Tuesday that while it ""continuously receives reports"" about weapons, vehicles and even convoys of vehicles moving throughout Libya, ""we do not discuss the intelligence and surveillance information we collect."" ""To be clear, our mission is to protect the civilian population in Libya, not to track and target thousands of fleeing former regime leaders, mercenaries, military commanders and internally displaced people,"" a NATO official said in an e-mailed statement. On Monday, Gadhafi spokesman Musa Ibrahim told Syrian al-Rai TV by phone that Gadhafi was ""in excellent health"" and that ""no one will be able to know where he physically is."" Meanwhile, representatives of Libya's transitional leadership met with tribal leaders in Bani Walid Tuesday to reiterate that pro-Gadhafi forces will not be harmed if they surrender peacefully. ""We want them to hear it from us again that we will not harm, kill or hurt anyone if they drop their weapons,"" Kenshil said. He added that the NTC made clear there will be no retribution for residents of Bani Walid and that the new leadership of Libya will respect property rights. ""We follow the law and order,"" Kenshil told CNN.  ""This is a new Libya."" ""We don't have a deal yet, but we are very optimistic and very confident that the tribal leaders of Bani Walid will persuade Gadhafi loyalists and forces to drop their weapons and resolve this peacefully."" Kenshil said rebels believe there are ""several big fish"" from the Gadhafi regime in Bani Walid. For more than six months, Libyans have demanded democratic reforms and an end to Gadhafi's 42-year rule. The unrest exploded into a civil war, and Gadhafi's regime crumbled after anti-Gadhafi fighters stormed the capital of Tripoli in late August. Gadhafi's wife, two of his sons and other relatives fled to Algeria recently, deepening mistrust between the new Libyan leadership and its neighbor. But Algeria said it acted on humanitarian grounds.

"(CNN) -- Three people were killed and two police officers were injured in a gun fight in Brooklyn Monday evening -- the latest bloodshed in a violent holiday weekend in New York City that saw at least 48 people shot. An exchange of gunfire between two men broke out in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood around 9 p.m. Monday, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference. Officers patrolling the nearby West Indian Parade and Carnival, the site of an earlier shooting Monday, responded to the scene. ""The officers were fired upon and returned fire,"" Bloomberg said. Police identified the gunmen, who both died in the shooting, as Eusi Randy Johnson, 29, and Leroy Webster, 32. Johnson died after Webster shot him in the neck, while Webster was killed by police, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. The dispute started as a fistfight in a hallway, then spilled into the street as it escalated, Bloomberg said.  It was not clear what the disagreement was over, the mayor said. A bullet Webster fired ""struck an innocent 56-year-old woman sitting on her stoop two doors down,"" Bloomberg said. The woman's name was Denise Gay and her daughter was at her side when she died, the mayor said. After rushing to the scene, officer Omar Medina ""was hit by bullet fragments in his left arm and chest,"" Bloomberg said. He was taken to a nearby hospital and was in stable condition, police said. A second officer, Avichaim Dicken, received a graze wound on his elbow. Webster had a lengthy criminal record that included arrests for assault, drugs and guns, Kelly said. The gun battle comes during a holiday weekend marred by shootings, with 33 people shot on Sunday alone.","Two men get in a gun fight in Brooklyn .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from a shooting at a Nevada IHOP restaurant has risen to four, officials said early Wednesday morning. A gunman carrying a variant of an AK-47 rifle opened fire on uniformed Nevada National Guard members as they were having breakfast at the Carson City restaurant Tuesday morning. In all, 11 people were shot. Of them, one civilian was killed as were two National Guard members. Another National Guard member, who was taken to a hospital and underwent surgery, later died -- bringing the toll to four, said Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong. The attacker also died of a self-inflicted wound after the shooting. The suspected gunman was identified as Eduardo Sencion, 32, who lived in Carson City and worked at a family business in South Lake Tahoe, California, authorities said. Authorities said they had not determined a clear motive. ""To say that he was targeting before he came into the restaurant those military persons, we have not been able to establish,"" Furlong said. ""Clearly, the fact that five of the 11 were military draws a concern by us."" Sencion had no previous criminal record on file but his family indicated he may have had mental health issues, Furlong told reporters. The shooting began shortly before 9 a.m. When authorities arrived, those who called in the incident identified the shooting suspect as a man lying wounded in the parking lot between two vehicles. The suspect had continued firing in the parking lot after leaving the restaurant, Furlong said. The AK-47 was recovered as well as an empty 30-round gun magazine and two other gun magazines. A pistol and assault rifle were found in or near a vehicle, the sheriff said. Steven Martin, a witness, told CNN Reno affiliate KRNV that he ran to see if he could help after he heard the shots. ""There was blood everywhere; broken glass everywhere. It was just a war zone down there,"" he said. The shooting took place just a few miles from the Nevada National Guard state headquarters in Carson City.","In all, 11 people are shot .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- His compound in Tripoli has been overrun, rebels control the closest international airport and world leaders including President Barack Obama are declaring his 42-year rule over. One major question that remains unanswered is: Where is Moammar Gadhafi? Rebel fighters who searched the sprawling Bab al-Aziziya compound in the Libyan capital on Tuesday found boxes of weapons and ammunition, but no Gadhafi. With the fighters of the National Transitional Council also in control of Tripoli's international airport, the options for an escape narrowed. Mukhtar al-Ahmar, who led the rebels in the takeover of the airport, said there had been fierce clashes there Wednesday, and speculated that Gadhafi loyalists were trying to ""to secure a route for Gadhafi to escape from Tripoli."" He said he saw an official convoy after sunset Tuesday, and said it was ""possible"" Gadhafi was inside. ""He doesn't seem to have much control of anything,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Tuesday. ""It's interesting that he still hasn't been seen."" So where could Gadhafi be? Professor Abubaker Saad, a former Gadhafi aide, on Tuesday described to CNN a system of bunkers under the Gadhafi compound in Tripoli that could serve as a hideout. However, Saad noted that NATO and the United States have fired anti-bunker bombs at the compound, so he doubted Gadhafi would hide out there. ""You have to remember that he is a military man,"" Saad said. ""He knows they have weapons that could penetrate those bunkers. That's why I'm dismissing the idea that he's still in there."" There has been speculation that tunnels might lead from Gadhafi's now-overrun bunker to the Rixos hotel, where about 35 journalists are being held against their will by low-ranking Gadhafi loyalists. But CNN's Matthew Chance, who is among the reporters trapped there, said journalists had scoured the hotel from top to bottom and seen no evidence of secret passages. Saad also noted that Gadhafi's recent public communications, such as a statement broadcast on radio and a reported telephone call to Russia, were audio messages to avoid detection of his whereabouts. ""The quality of the audio has deteriorated, and that's an indication that he is speaking from a distance,"" Saad said. ""That's why I am not really convinced that he is in the compound right now."" U.S. officials called for Gadhafi to make clear that, regardless of where he may be, he knows he's out as the nation's leader. The United States wants Gadhafi to issue ""a reliable, affirmative statement"" to the international community and his loyalists still fighting in Tripoli ""that he understands ... his leadership is over, so everyone can move on,"" Nuland said. While no sightings of Gadhafi have been reported, at least one source outside Libya -- the head of the World Chess Federation -- told Russia's Interfax news agency that he spoke by telephone with him on Tuesday. According to Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, as reported by Interfax, Gadhafi said in the phone call to him at around 10 a.m. ET that he is ""alive and well in Tripoli and not going to leave Libya."" A U.S. official, speaking on condition of not being identified, said Gadhafi is most likely still in Tripoli. There has been nothing to confirm some reports or speculation that the longtime leader has gone to his hometown of Sirte, the official said. Observers cite three likely scenarios for Gadhafi's immediate future -- his death at the hands of rebel forces, his capture, or his escape or exile to another country. Gadhafi and his second-eldest son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, are under indictment for alleged crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. Officials at the ICC have made clear they want the Gadhafis to stand trial in The Hague, if possible. Countries considered possible exile homes for Gadhafi include Venezuela, a rumored destination for months. Gadhafi and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have a close relationship forged in part by shared opposition to U.S. influence around the globe. In 2009, Chavez was one of three world leaders to attend a lavish celebration of Gadhafi's 40 years of rule in Tripoli, along with Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and King Abdullah of Jordan. That same year a new football stadium in the now rebel-held town of Benghazi was named after the Venezuelan leader. On Tuesday, Chavez said his country would only recognize a Libyan government led by Gadhafi, state media reported. ""From here we confirm our solidarity with the Libyan people, our brother that is being assaulted and bombed ... as part of the imperial insanity,"" Chavez said during a meeting of government ministers in Caracas, the state-run AVN news agency reported. Zimbabwe also is considered a possible exile destination, due to common interests between Gadhafi and President Mugabe -- an interest in pan-African solidarity, a disdain for colonial influence and the ignominy of being largely shunned by the international community. Saudi Arabia is considered a desert nation that might be more to Gadhafi's Bedouin liking. The Saudis accepted the deposed leader of Tunisia, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, after the uprising there that helped touch off protests across the Middle East and North Africa, including Libya, this year. However, Gadhafi's relationship with Saudi Arabia has cooled since the Saudis accused Libyans of trying to kill their king several years ago, and it would be unlikely for the desert kingdom to accept an exiled Gadhafi now, according to Christopher Boucek, a Saudi Arabia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Other nations mentioned as possible destinations for Gadhafi include Cuba, Syria and Sudan. CNN's Tom Cohen and Mike Pearson contributed to this report.","There is no sign of the longtime leader in his over-run compound .

"(CNN) -- Turkish champions Fenerbahce have been withdrawn from the European Champions League group stage by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) in relation to bribery and match fixing allegations. In July more than 30 people were arrested and jailed over claims that several football matches, as many as 19, in the Turkish first and second divisions had been manipulated. The highest profile figure arrested in the scandal was Fenerbahce's president Aziz Yildirim. Fenerbahce won last season's title on goal difference from Trabzonspor. But as the arrests mount the TFF decided to withdraw Fenerbahce before UEFA, European football's governing body, was forced to act on its behalf. ""Regarding the heavy disciplinary sanctions both Fenerbahce and the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), which means Turkey might encounter, it is decided to ban Fenerbahce Sports Club from the UEFA Champions' League this season,"" read a statement posted on the TFF's official web site. The move took place 24 hours before Thursday's group stage draw. European football's governing body acted swiftly to end speculation over who will replace Fenerbahce by announcing that Trabzonspor, who finished second in the Turkish league last season, will take the final group stage berth. After a meeting of UEFA's Emergency Committee on Wednesday evening it was also agreed that Spanish club Athletic Bilbao will no longer need to take part in a qualification match against Trabzonspor on Thursday and will go straight in to the Europa League instead. ""The panel considered that the Turkish Football Federation took the right decision to protect the game, fully in line with our zero-tolerance policy against match-fixing,""  said UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino in a statement posted on UEFA's web site.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Republican Party will not provide a formal response to President Barack Obama's speech on jobs, a senior GOP aide said Tuesday. ""This is not a State of the Union Address,"" said a senior GOP leadership aide, who spoke on condition of not being identified. ""The (House) speaker is opening Statuary Hall (in the Capitol) to media following the speech, giving every member of Congress the opportunity to provide a reaction to the president's address,"" the aide said. Obama plans to unveil a major jobs initiative to a joint session of Congress Thursday. After the scheduling brouhaha over the president's State of the Union-style speech was resolved last week, Republican aides in the House and Senate were noticeably mum about details of the official response, which typically all the major television networks carry about five minutes after the president's speech in the House chamber ends. ""Republicans are, and have been, entirely focused on job creation,"" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, on Tuesday.  ""Every member of Congress, and -- more importantly -- the American people, will provide a reaction to the president's address.  We trust in the good judgment of the American people, and the president's proposals will rise or fall on their own merits."" In the past GOP leaders have chosen rising political stars in their party including Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana to respond to the president's speech. In January Republicans tapped House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to give the official GOP response to the president's State of the Union speech. In September 2009, when Obama delivered a major speech on health care to a joint session, Louisiana Republican Rep Charles Boustany, a heart surgeon, was picked to present the GOP health care plan.

Fourteen alleged members of the pro-British or loyalist paramilitary group known as the Ulster Volunteer Force are accused of a total of 97 offenses. The men range in age from 32 to 46. Nine defendants are charged with murder in the October 2000 slaying of rival paramilitary leader Tommy English. The 40-year-old Ulster Defence Association member was gunned down in front of his wife and young children on Halloween night during a bloody feud between the rival groups. The Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association were responsible for the killings of hundreds of people during the conflict between pro-British and pro-Irish forces in Northern Ireland over a 30-year period known as the Troubles. Most of their victims were Catholic civilians. The groups have remained active since the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998. Two brothers -- David and Robert Stewart -- are giving evidence against their alleged former colleagues in the Ulster Volunteer Force. The Stewarts admitted to their part in English's killing and agreed to testify to get a reduced sentence. One of the accused is Mark Haddock, 42, named as a police agent in a 2007 report on the Ulster Volunteer Force by former Northern Ireland police ombudsman Nuala O'Loan. O'Loan said an Ulster Volunteer Force gang based in the Mount Vernon estate in north Belfast had been involved in up to 15 murders and that the Northern Ireland police special branch unit had allowed informers within the Mount Vernon group to act with impunity. At trial, Haddock is sitting separately from the 13 other defendants, surrounded by prison officers for his own safety. Two of his co-defendants were previously charged with trying to kill Haddock in 2006, but murder charges were dropped when he refused to give evidence. A prosecutor opened the case Tuesday, saying Haddock had ordered English's murder. Robert Stewart, 37, then started testifying Tuesday. He also said Haddock ordered the killing and told the gunman to try to avoid shooting the rest of English's family. Supporters of the accused men staged a protest outside the court against the use of ""supergrasses,"" or slang for informers. The term was first used in Northern Ireland in the 1980s when a number of terrorist suspects were convicted on the evidence of former comrades. The trial is being held under 2005 legislation introduced by the United Kingdom -- the Serious Organized Crime and Police Act -- which allows a suspect to enter a written agreement to give evidence against other alleged criminals. Victims' relatives are being given protection from supporters of the Ulster Volunteer Force attending the trial at Laganside courts in Belfast. Families are able to watch proceedings by video link in a separate, secure venue. Large numbers of police officers are inside and outside the court complex. The trial could last three months and will be one of the most expensive ever in Northern Ireland. Police fear there could be unrest in Protestant/loyalist districts as the trial progresses.","Belfast court has a heavy police presence as 14 defendants go on trial in large terrorism case .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- Fidel Castro appeared ""very well"" during a meeting this week with Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, telling her that he watched President Obama's inauguration on television, Argentina's official news agency reported. Fidel Castro is shown talking on the phone in Cuba in October 2006. Castro said he believes Obama is ""a sincere person with good ideas,"" Kirchner said in Cuba at the conclusion of a three-day visit, according to the state-run Telam news agency. ""We talked about all subjects,"" Kirchner said of her Wednesday meeting with Castro. ""I found him very well. We talked about the international situation."" The report appears to belie widespread speculation that the Cuban revolutionary leader had suffered a major relapse or had died. The 82-year-old Castro has not been seen in public since ceding power to his brother Raul in 2006. An account of Wednesday's meeting, published under Castro's name, also appeared in the Cuban news agency ACN late Wednesday. In it, the 82-year-old former leader noted that Obama is the 11th U.S. president to hold office since the communist revolution that brought him to power in 1959. ""Even though the huge power of that country, they have not been able to destroy the Cuban revolution,"" the agency quoted him as saying. He said he had ""no doubt"" of Obama's honesty, ""but his noble intentions leave many questions unanswered. For example, I asked myself, how could a wasteful and very consuming system preserve the environment?"" Castro transferred his office to his younger brother on a temporary basis in July 2006 after suffering from an undisclosed illness, often thought to be of his digestive system. Though photos sometimes surface, he has made no public appearances since then and handed power to Raul Castro permanently in February 2008. Rumors circulated last week that the elder Castro had taken seriously ill again. Although these rumors surface periodically, some analysts paid particular attention this time because no photos of him had been seen since November, and he made no comments on the Cuban revolution's 50th anniversary on January 1.","Argentina's president says she talked to Fidel Castro .

"New York (CNN) -- Some families of 9/11 victims say they are confused, anxious and surprised as the 10th anniversary approaches because they have not received invitations to the Sunday ceremony opening the ground zero memorial. Gillian Joseph, who lost her husband Stephen in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, said she is thinking of canceling her plans to attend the memorial because the whole thing seems so disorganized. ""There was no notification. I made reservations not knowing what the final plans were. I still haven't received an official invitation,"" Joseph said. She added that the last thing she wants for herself and her 12-year-old son is have to deal with a large crowd and make a ""hard day even harder."" Joseph said she has made several calls to the New York mayor's office about her missing invitation without hearing back. So did Ansu Philip, who said the mayor's office finally told her after several days of calling that she would be receiving the invitation last week but she still has not received it. It's been 10 days since she spoke to the mayor's office, and she is anxious to make sure she and her relatives can attend the memorial to honor her daughter, Sneha Anne Philip. And a widow who did not wish to be identified told CNN while she did not receive an official invitation, she assumed there would be some kind of memorial. ""We made plans knowing that something was going to happen. My friend will take us with her. She got two invitations, I got none,"" she said. The woman still feels she should have gotten her own invitation, especially since she says she has never had any problems receiving memorial notifications in the past. ""I'm appalled, surprised, and irritated. This just makes things more difficult,"" the widow said. The confusion and anxieties surround official invitations -- or lack of them -- for the Sunday morning service that will mark the opening of the National September 11 Memorial at ground zero. The ceremony starting at 8:30 a.m. will include the reading of the names of victims and two moments of silence to mark the times the towers were hit. Family members will be allowed in the memorial, where they will see for the first time their loved ones' names inscribed in bronze. Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's office said in a statement on Sunday: ""We communicate regularly with the family members and have recently sent out letters and e-mails about this year's ceremony. Family members have direct access to our staff for any questions that arise, and we'll have staff on site that day to resolve any issues. So while we apologize for any confusion, there is no reason for any family member to be concerned about not being able to attend the ceremony."" Joe Daniels is the president and CEO of the 9/11 memorial. He said he has reached out to victims' families, letting them know that if they have not yet received an official invitation, they will be able to use alternate methods to identify themselves for admission to the ceremony. ""I want to assure you that nothing has changed from years past in terms of access to the ceremony,"" Daniels said. That offers little consolation to family members who want a real invitation that will guarantee them entry. Lois Paterson-Gallo worries that trying to get into the ceremony with other identification methods will complicate getting in, and that will add more stress and anxiety. ""I want the official invitation to cut down on the hassle the day of the memorial. I don't feel totally comfortable that this is going to work,"" she said. Laurie Mirak, whose husband died on 9/11, is traveling and said she won't be back home to get her invitation until after September 11, if in fact it arrives. She has been relying on a website for the 9/11 community of families -- Voices of September 11th -- for information. She plans to bring her husband's death certificate to gain entry to the memorial. Mirak said she is planning on taking part in all of the memorials for her husband and the other victims, and has invitations to all events -- except the ground zero memorial ceremony Sunday morning. Not everyone has had a problem receiving an invitation, though. Elaine Hughes, whose son Kris died on 9/11, received her cardboard invitation in the mail two weeks ago. She thinks the whole issue of invitations is getting blown out of proportion and is confident that ""if you're a family member, they're going to let you in."" Patricia Tamuccio, who lost a son, was anxious until her invitation arrived in the mail last Thursday. She plans to bring other relatives and she received a notice telling her that she was permitted to bring guests. David de Vere from the United Kingdom, who lost a relative on 9/11, received his invitation in plenty of time to plan a visit and he said he wonders if some people just weren't in the correct database.","A ceremony Sunday morning will open the 9/11 memorial at ground zero .

"(CNN) -- His was a suicide with a macabre twist. In February, former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson shot himself in the chest, but not before leaving behind a note requesting that his brain be studied for evidence of a disease striking football players. The plaintive note read, ""Please, see that my brain is given to the NFL's brain bank."" Scientists announced Monday that Duerson's brain tissue showed ""moderately advanced"" evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a dementia-like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma. ""Dave Duerson had classic pathology of CTE and no evidence of any other disease,"" said Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist with the Bedford VA medical center, and co-director of the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. ""He had severe involvement of areas that control judgment, inhibition, impulse control, mood and memory."" CTE has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players thus far studied at the Boston University center. Their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions, sub-concussive blows to the head, or both. The picture beginning to emerge from these cases is that that trauma could be causing brain damage. A brain with CTE is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau. Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia. But the cases of CTE have shown this progressive, dementia-like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs when people are in their 70s or 80s. Mike Webster, an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers and also diagnosed posthumously with CTE, was 50 when he died. John Grimsley, a nine-year NFL veteran who played most of his career with the Houston Oilers was 45, and Duerson was 50. Scientists at BU have found evidence of CTE in the brain of an athlete as young as 18. ""To see the kind of changes we're seeing in 45-year-olds is basically unheard of,"" McKee said in an earlier interview with CNN. Duerson suffered a minimum of 10 known concussions during the course of his career, some of them involving loss of consciousness, said Dr. Robert Stern, co-director of the Boston University center. Symptoms that nagged Duerson after he retired from the NFL in 1993 were typical of cases such as Webster and Grimsley, including problems with impulse control, an increasingly short fuse and headaches. Duerson's ex-wife said that while playing professionally, the head trauma he bore on the field would become plain after games ended. ""Sometimes he would come home with extreme headaches,"" said Alicia Duerson during an interview with CNN in February. ""We would meet after the game and he would want me to drive because he felt dizziness or he just didn't feel stable."" Alicia Duerson said that several years before he died, her husband had been extremely bright, articulate, gifted. But as time wore on, he began to lose those faculties. Duerson began to have trouble forming coherent sentences and spelling. Alongside cognitive and emotional problems, a business that he established after his NFL career began failing. The tragic culmination of his problems was his suicide on February 17. ""We do seem to be seeing an increased rate in athletes who have early and moderate stage CTE,"" said McKee, adding the caveat that the BU sample is autopsy-based and therefore inherently biased. Duerson's death, and specifically the decision to shoot himself in the chest, apparently to avoid damaging his brain tissue, shocked members of his family and the football community. Duerson's case is the first in the CTE narrative in which a player ostensibly took his own life to have his brain studied. ""It's important for people to understand that it does not help our research or our mission of the CSTE to take their own lives because they fear they have this disease,"" said Stern. ""The future will lead to successful treatment of this disease."" Duerson's son Tregg said that the analysis of his father's brain -- the answers to questions about death -- has given the family a measure of closure. ""It is my greatest hope that his death will not be in vain and that through this research his legacy will live on and others won't have to suffer in this manner,"" Tregg Duerson said.","David Duerson shot himself in the chest in February .

"LONDON, England -- New photos released this week show British air force jets shadowing Russian bombers over the North Atlantic Ocean in scenes that echo the Cold War and highlight Moscow's growing assertiveness. A British Royal Air Force Typhoon F2 fighter plane (left) encounters a Russian Bear-H bomber over the Atlantic. The images from Britain's Ministry of Defence show an encounter outside British airspace last Friday between the Royal Air Force's (RAF) new Typhoon F2 aircraft and one of several Russian Bear-H bombers. The incident comes as Moscow seeks to raise its military profile. The encounter happened on the same day that Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, announced it was to resume the Soviet-era practice of continuous long-range bomber patrols on a permanent basis. The move is regarded by analysts as one of several signs of growing Russian assertiveness. Also Tuesday Putin announced plans to revive Russia's aviation industry after more than a decade of post-Soviet under-funding, Reuters said. Opening the MAKS-2007 airshow at the Zhukovsky airbase, east of Moscow, Putin said that ""Russia ... faces the task of maintaining supremacy in producing military aircraft"", according to the agency. Reuters said Putin made his comments as a formation of two dozen warplanes, civilian craft and helicopters roared past at the event, which is intended as a mark of the nation's aviation ambitions. ""The show presents the unique potential of our country,"" the agency quoted him as saying. The British jets, from Number XI Squadron and on their first mission since becoming the UK's new reaction force, cover the southern part of England and were launched from RAF Coningsby, in Lincolnshire, eastern England, according to the Ministry of Defence. The encounter in the skies was not the first this year between the UK and Russia. In July, two Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers made unusually long sorties over the North Sea, leading Norway and Britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them. Russia's air force said later it was a routine flight. And earlier this month Russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the Pacific island of Guam, where the U.S. military has a base. U.S. planes were scrambled to track them. Last week White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the United States. ""Militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities, so this is not entirely surprising,"" he said. The encounters follow growing rifts during the past 12 months between Russia and the West on issues including Kosovo, energy, and Moscow's treatment of its ex-Soviet neighbors. Earlier this year Putin caused a stir by saying Russian missiles would again be aimed at European targets if the U.S. persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic. Tensions between the two countries later cooled after compromise talks between Putin and U.S. President George Bush. And the UK and Russia have engaged in tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions of diplomats after Russia refused to allow the extradition of Andrei Lugovoi, a former security service agent turned businessman. Lugovoi is accused by the British authorities of the radiation poisoning of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London last year, a charge Lugovoi has denied. E-mail to a friend .

"Monaco (CNN) -- A day after tying the knot in a civil ceremony, Monaco's ruler and his South African bride reaffirmed their union Saturday in a religious ceremony at the prince's palace. The event kicked off the second day of festivities in the small seaside nation of 33,000, where a holiday has been declared to celebrate the wedding of Charlene Wittstock, a former Olympic swimmer, and Prince Albert. The 3,500 guests -- which include 20 heads of state, fellow royals and a number of moguls and celebrities -- began to arrive hours earlier Saturday afternoon at the palace, the same place where one day earlier the couple's civil ceremony had taken place. They walked through Palace Square into the courtyard, passing hundreds of onlookers who followed the nuptials on a pair of giant screens. The last one to stroll the carpet, just before 5 p.m., was Wittstock herself. Her white wedding gown was designed by Giorgio Armani, according to the fashion designer's Facebook page. Archbishop Bernard Barsi conducted the Roman Catholic ceremony under partly cloudy skies, with temperatures forecast to be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. ""We ask God to bless you, to make your love strong and keep you in unity and loyalty,"" the archbishop said. In matching vows, the couple promised to remain loyal to one another in sickness and in health, and then slipped wedding rings on each other's fingers. Once the ceremony ended, the new princess left to leave her bouquet at the Sainte Devote church -- a Monaco tradition -- and join her new husband for a public procession through the city streets. This will be followed by an official dinner crafted by celebrity chef Alain Ducasse and fireworks outside the Opera de Monte Carlo. The event has galvanized the attention of thousands around the world, whose fascination with Monaco's royalty blossomed with the April 1956 wedding of Prince Ranier III and Hollywood movie star Grace Kelly. Albert, 53, is that couple's only son, and they also had two daughters in Princesses Caroline and Stephanie. Prince Albert formally became Monaco's head of state following his father's death in 2005. While he has publicly acknowledged he has fathered two children, this is his first marriage. Also an Olympian, having competed in bobsled competitions in five Olympic Winter Games -- from Calgary in 1988 to Salt Lake City in 2002 -- the prince met Wittstock at a swimming event in Monaco in 2000. That summer, the 33-year-old woman swam for South Africa in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The couple announced their engagement last summer. The couple's marriage became legal Friday, with a short civil ceremony at the palace. Afterwards, the couple and their guests feasted at a picnic and took in musical concert featuring Jean Michel Jarre. The guest list for the two-day extravaganza includes heads of state, like French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silivia, and members of the rich and famous such as British model Naomi Campbell, British business mogul Richard Branson and Armani. However, the United Kingdom's royal newlyweds -- Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge -- missed the wedding as they are on an official tour of Canada.","NEW: The religious ceremony is held in the courtyard of the prince's palace .

"(CNN) -- In its halcyon days, the Rixos hotel in Tripoli, Libya boasted of going the extra mile to make guests ""feel privileged."" It sent flowers and cooled towels to their rooms, and made Porsches and Jaguars -- even helicopters -- available at a moment's notice. But by early Wednesday, the remaining guests at the luxury hotel in the Libyan capital were reduced to raiding cabinets for cheese and fruit. About 35 journalists who were allowed into the North African country to cover the conflict with the blessing of the Moammar Gadhafi regime are trapped at the hotel for a fifth day. And about five more journalists covering clashes in the area fled into the hotel Wednesday morning and were briefly barred from leaving, said CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, who is among those at the hotel. Four were later allowed to go, she saw. But armed Gadhafi loyalists ring the hotel's perimeter and patrol its corridors, barring most journalists there from leaving. It's for their protection, the guards say. CNN's Matthew Chance, who is also at the hotel, urged other journalists in the city not to come for fear they, too, would be trapped. ""We are not being allowed to leave. We want to leave. We are obviously in a very fragile position,"" he said. They have enough snack food and bottled water to last for several days, he explained. ""After that, we're going to be in trouble,"" he added. So, as battle rages outside for control of Tripoli between pro-regime and rebel forces, the reporters can do little but sit and wait. With no air-conditioning and sporadic electricity, they walk the halls with the glow of candlelight to guide them. Giant paintings of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi stare down at them from hotel walls. Snipers keep a wary eye from rooftops. ""The concern we have now is that we seem to be in one of the few remaining patches of territory in Libya which is still controlled by Gadhafi's forces,"" Chance said. ""And so we're kind of very anxious about what might happen at this hotel in the hours ahead."" The reporters spend their days in helmets and bullet proof vests. At night, they sleep on bedsheets in the hallway to avoid shards of glass from windows shattered by gunfire. ""This is not a comfortable position, but ... all in good spirits,"" BBC correspondent Matthew Price tweeted Tuesday. Chance said the journalists would like to ""negotiate an exit,"" but have been prevented from doing so. The reporters have put up white bed sheets from the top floor balconies of the hotel. In large black letters, they scrawled the words ""TV, press, don't shoot"" on them to leave no doubt they are impartial observers in the conflict. ""Gadhafi loyalists have basically regarded the international media as being on the rebels' side in this conflict, even though that's obviously not the case,"" Chance said. ""We're just here trying to report the government's side of things in this conflict."" The hotel has served as a de facto media hub approved by the regime for international journalists and scores of government officials who relocated their families there during the civil war. It also made headlines along the way. In March, Eman al-Obeidy, stormed the hotel in tears while journalists were having breakfast and said Gadhafi forces had raped her. In May, Gadhafi himself made an unannounced appearance to hold a meeting with tribal leaders. His sudden appearance, and the fact that the hotel is now being guarded so closely, has led to some speculation that Gadhafi himself is there, or that he has access to the hotel through secret tunnels from his bunker. But Chance said he and other journalists had ""scoured"" the hotel ""from top to bottom"" and had seen no evidence of tunnels. On Tuesday, Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam, turned up to debunk reports that rebels had captured him. Hours after the son's defiance stance, rebel fighters and throngs of citizens stormed the ruler's fortress compound in Bab al-Aziziya not far away. Celebratory gunfire rang out as residents took off with souvenirs, including reams of documents and weapons. But away from the action, the journalists waited as dawn gave way to another day Wednesday -- and more clashes erupted outside the hotel. Chance said their goal is to avoid agitating the guards. ""We do not want to prompt any dangerous action,"" he said. ""We are trying to stay as safe as possible."" He hopes the nightmare, as he called it, ends soon. ""In a fizzle,"" he said. ""Not a bang.""","NEW: CNN's Matthew Chance at the hotel warns other journalists not to come .

"(CNN) -- Newly-promoted Atalanta will start the Italian Serie A season with a six-point deduction for their part in an alleged match-fixing scandal. The club's 38-year-old captain Cristiano Doni has also been banned for three-and-half years by the Italian Football Federation, which could effectively end his career. Doni's teammate, Thomas Manfredini, received a three-year ban while former Italy international Giuseppe Signori was suspended for five years. Eight more clubs were also punished by the disciplinary committee, including Ascoli, in the second division, who were also docked six points. Third tier club Ravenna were expelled from the league and Alessandria have been relegated. Benevento had nine points deducted, Cremonese six, Piacenza four and Reggiana. Spezia and Taranta were penalized a point each. Atalanta said in a statement on their official web site they were ""deeply disappointed"" and intended to appeal the decision. Marco Paoloni, a former goalkeeper for Cremonese and Benevento, was at the center of the allegations and has been handed a ban of five years. A total of 16 players and 16 clubs have been punished in some form.","Atalanta hit by six-point deduction after probe into alleged match fixing .

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- Bodies lie scattered in a rural field in the southern Philippines, some unearthed from a shallow grave hastily dug by the gunmen who seized the group of men and women just a day earlier. By Tuesday, search teams had found a total of 46 bodies, and it was still unclear if there were more victims from Monday's massacre. The target was a group that included the female relatives of Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao province in May. Mangudadatu said he had received threats which he believed were from allies of the incumbent governor Andal Ampatuan -- that he would be kidnapped if he filed the candidate papers himself. Instead, his wife, sister, and the group of journalists accompanying them were kidnapped and brutally killed, possibly tortured, raped and beheaded, according to local media reports. A local police commander described the grisly search operation near an isolated village, telling reporters from ABS-CBN News that 17 bodies were pulled from a single grave. ""They were piled on top of each other,"" Chief Superintendent Josefino Cataluna said. ""It looked as if they were buried hurriedly."" Those killed included at least 12 journalists, according to the press freedom organization, Reporters Without Borders, making Monday the deadliest single day for journalists anywhere in the world. It was also the worst politically motivated violence in the Philippines' recent history. Witnesses, local officials and analysts have blamed the attacks on Ampatuan, who has controlled the area for a decade and is a long-time ally of Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Ampatuan, who is known locally as a warlord, reportedly commands a private army of nearly 500 men. Philippine military officials also said Monday that the gunmen who carried out the attack were loyal to Ampatuan. Neither Ampatuan nor any of his advisers has commented on the slaying allegations. ""It's not hard to determine the motive,"" according to Philippine analyst Kenneth E. Bauzon. ""How dare this [Mangudadatu] challenge him when he knows that the governor is a position that is presumably reserved for [the Ampatuan] family."" Ampatuan reportedly wanted one of his sons to succeed him as governor of Maguindanao when he stepped down next year, according to ABS-CBN. A government construction vehicle was found at the site of the hastily dug mass grave, fueling the belief that Ampatuan or his allies had a role in the massacre. Both the Ampatuan and Mangudadatu clans have agreed to participate in the government's investigation into the killings, according to Arroyo's adviser on the Mindanao region, Jesus Dureza, who spoke to the Philippine media on Tuesday. Neither Ampatuan nor his advisers have spoken publicly about the widespread allegations, and that is most likely because he is ""weighing his options,"" Bauzon said. Now, the region is bracing for a backlash of possible reprisal killings. The Philippine government has placed Maguindanao and its surrounding regions under a state of emergency and survivors of Monday's massacre have entered a government witness protection program, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. Arroyo has sent top level government officials to Maguindanao to ""personally oversee military action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts,"" she said Tuesday. ""No effort has been spared to bring justice to the victims and hold the perpetrators accountable to the full limit of the law,"" she said. Long-running family disputes in the southern Philippines have spilled innocent blood before. Such blood feuds are known by the indigenous term, ""rido."" But Monday's massacre has broader implications, Bauzon said. ""I think that this is a culmination for many years of impunity on the part of any family or group for that matter because this has been tolerated by the Arroyo administration,"" said Bauzon, a political science associate professor at Saint Joseph's College in New York, who is from Mindanao and has authored several books on the region and its politics. ""So when the administration looks the other way when journalists report on military abuses [or] when the administration looks the other way when church workers are assassinated, when environmental workers are assassinated or abducted, you know, this [massacre] is just one or two steps away [from that]."" The killings could further damage the political reputation of Arroyo, whose administration has already been scarred by allegations of a tainted election in 2004 and criticism over her response to the recent typhoons to strike the country. ""It's a test as to what how far the Arroyo administration will go to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators,"" Bauzon said. Arroyo's term ends in May 2010, and she cannot seek re-election although there has been speculation that she could seek another political office. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the Philippines, a predominantly Christian country. Negotiations between one of those armed groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and the Philippine government broke down last year after the country's Supreme Court blocked a proposed peace deal that would have increased the size and scope of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Arroyo's government exercises little control in the region and is blamed by her critics for helping legitimize many of the armed groups that operate freely in Mindanao, including those loyal to the governor, Ampatuan. Arroyo issued an executive order in July 2006 that allowed local officials and Philippine National Police to deputize volunteer watchmen, known as barangay tanods, to fight against insurgent groups in the southern regions. This order has been blamed for allowing local politicians to convert their private militias into legal security forces. The strong clan rivalries and the armed groups that support each clan may make it impossible for Arroyo to rout out those behind Monday's mass killing, according to Bauzon. ""The dynasty is strongly entrenched and for her to disband private armies by this warlord overnight is too much of a task,"" he said. ""The Americans were not able to do it in half a century and all she can do is set her sights low by really going after the most visible of the perpetrators.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The estranged husband of ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" cast member Taylor Armstrong apparently killed himself in his home, according to police and the Los Angeles county coroner's office. Russell Armstrong's lawyer said he's ""100% convinced"" Armstrong's role in the reality show created his depression, but he does not blame the Bravo network for his death. Investigators did not find a suicide note near the body of Armstrong, 47, who was pronounced dead at 8:16 p.m. Monday, Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Tuesday. His body was found in a Mulholland Drive home in the hills above Bel Air, California, Winter said. ""It does appear to be a suicide by hanging,"" Los Angeles Police spokesman Richard French said. Armstrong was the subject of numerous celebrity gossip website stories in recent weeks that detailed allegations of abuse made against him in his pending divorce. After Taylor Armstrong filed for divorce last month she told People magazine that she was verbally and physically abused during their nearly six-year marriage. ""I felt like I was dying inside,"" she told People. ""Now, there's some sense of peace."" In his interview with People, Russell Armstrong said, ""Maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were. This show has literally pushed us to the limit."" Ronald Richards, who was Russell Armstrong's lawyer, said in an interview Tuesday with A.J. Hammer, host of HLN's ""Showbiz Tonight,"" that the response to the divorce filing was sitting on his desk and had been about to be filed in court. ""He did not want the divorce at all, but he was willing to accept her decision,"" Richards said. ""He tried to fix some of her concerns, but as I've advised many couples in this area, including Mr. Armstrong, these shows have a way of tearing apart a marriage when one spouse takes a certain directions and the other spouse is left kind of supporting the financial part of the marriage."" Armstrong, who was defending himself against a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, was financially drained, Richards said. His credit cards had been suspended, adding to the pressure, he said. But his downfall was caused by his role in the reality show, he said. ""I'm 100% convinced and based on facts that this show led to his depression on a couple different grounds,"" Richards said. ""One is that the show characterized him as someone that abused his spouse. It highlighted ancient financial negatives in his past and put him in a spotlight that he wasn't equipped to deal with."" His lawyer said the allegations of verbal and physical abuse stemmed from ""drunk arguments."" ""That's what they were dealing with here,"" he said. ""There may have been the normal type of kind of shoving that drunk people sometimes get into."" A combination of factors stemming from the show were ""wearing on him,"" his lawyer said. ""There's the appearance that she's moving forward as a celebrity,"" Richards said. ""He's now a divorce male with kids and he still has a tremendous debt service that he was handling for both of them that was supporting their lifestyle."" The sudden celebrity that followed the Armstrong's appearance on ""Real Housewives"" was overwhelming to the couple, he said. ""When that sort of stardom attacks a marriage sort of overnight, like in the case of a reality TV star, it's not like an actor that progressively moves up the ladder and the couple deals with this in stages,"" he said. ""A reality show takes an average person that has no stardom and throws them into a public spotlight literally within a couple of episodes, and a lot of couples are not prepared for that and this is a very unfortunate consequence."" Still, Richards said he does not blame the network for his client's depression and death. ""A network cannot be held accountable to people's voluntarily opening of their doors of their private lives. The adults that allowed this to happen to them are responsible,"" the attorney said. ""The network is justified in making good television out of their conflict."" Armstrong's death should serve as a warning to the dangers people face when they sign up for a reality show, he said. ""Adults need to go into these things with your eyes wide open, (realizing) that if you're going to have a network cover your private life, you become a public figure, people can comment about you and there's a high degree of probability that your marriage will end up in shambles as a result of this newfound scrutiny by the public and by the TV network that is covering our private lives,"" Richards said. The network that carries the show issued a short statement Tuesday morning: . ""All of us at Bravo are deeply saddened by this tragic news. Our sympathy and thoughts are with the Armstrong family at this difficult time."" CNN's Brittany Kaplan and Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawyer: ""I'm 100% convinced"" the reality TV role created his depression .

"(CNN) -- The shooting down of a Chinook helicopter in central Afghanistan with the loss of 38 lives -- most of them U.S. Navy SEALs -- highlights two crucial aspects of the conflict in Afghanistan, as U.S. forces begin to draw down and Afghan security forces start taking the lead. The first is the growing reliance on U.S. Special Operations Forces to combat the Taliban and other insurgent groups -- in operations every night across the country. The second is that many areas far beyond the Taliban's traditional strongholds in the south remain very insecure, areas where the Taliban have exploited an instinctive wariness of a foreign force among locals -- and punished those who dare to work with them. One such place is the Tangi Valley in Wardak province, where the crash occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning. Soldiers who have served there describe it as perfect territory for insurgents, with steep mountainsides of shale and boulders overlooking orchards and thick vegetation. Improvised bombs are regularly planted along the one road that runs through the valley, next to the Logar River, and detonated from vantage points above. (NATO officials say that the IEDs' control wires are laid across the river, making pursuit of the insurgents more difficult.) Tangi is only 60 miles from Kabul, close to the main highway south. But the Taliban (though not al Qaeda or other foreign groups) have long been active in the area. In 2009, soldiers in the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division were deployed to this part of Wardak. They encountered 57 roadside bombs in the valley in just three months, dubbing the road ""IED alley"" and ""Walter Reed Highway,"" a reference to the Army medical center where many soldiers wounded in Afghanistan have received treatment. Firefights were an almost daily occurrence. On his blog this weekend, a former member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade recently deployed to Tangi wrote of the village where the helicopter came down. ""Juy Zarin is a village we went to frequently during our deployment and never found anything good while out there. In fact it was a wonderful place to go if we felt like getting into contact."" Back in the 1980s, the Soviet Army was never able to pacify the region, and Soviet convoys were frequently ambushed there. Earlier this year U.S. forces passed control of the military post in the valley to Afghan troops. Lt. Col. Thomas S. Rickard of the 10th Mountain Division handed over Combat Outpost Tangi to a unit of the Afghan National Army. ""As we lose U.S. personnel, we have to concentrate on the greater populations,"" Rickard told the U.S. Army website at the time. But the afghan Army did not maintain a permanent presence at the outpost, according to officials of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). As elsewhere, especially in eastern Afghanistan, U.S. forces are now returning to areas previously seen as too remote to focus on or too difficult to defend, where the Taliban and other insurgent groups have filled the vacuum. As they do, the risk of casualties grows -- as does the role of U.S. special forces. The use of U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF) in Afghanistan has grown exponentially. In a talk two weeks ago at the Aspen Security Forum, the outgoing commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, Adm. Eric T. Olson, disclosed that SOF carried out ""somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 operations"" in 2010 alone. ""This is now routine, every night....ground forces getting on a helicopter and flying against a target,"" Olson said. The template of such operations includes ""a quick reaction force on call to render assistance should things go bad,"" Olson said. In Friday night's attack, it was the quick reaction force, on its way to assist an ongoing mission by Army Rangers, that perished. Speaking of the Navy SEALs who took part in the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, Adm. Olson made their role sound almost mundane. ""For the people involved it was another mission and another target....This is not a force that sits on the second deck of the fire station waiting for the bell to ring every 10 or 15 years. We trace our lessons back to what we did last night."" Who are the Navy SEALs? But he also recognized the huge burden now falling on Special Operations Forces to subdue the Taliban. ""We are beginning to fray around the edges. We are asking an awful lot of our people,"" he said at the Aspen conference, adding that SOF units were seeing ""a lot of separations short of divorce."" But 82% of SOF troops who have the choice of leaving or staying in choose the latter, according to Olson. And more will be asked of them. Of the 33,000 U.S. troops due to be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2012, none will be special forces. Special Operations Command -- drawn from all four branches of the U.S. military -- has grown to a strength of 60,000. With a $10 billion budget it is now larger than the U.S. Coast Guard and about the same size as the entire Canadian Defense Force. And the caliber of its members reflects its special status. Thirty percent are college graduates. They are more experienced than regular soldiers, with an average age of 30, and they volunteer multiple times. Olson says 60% of SOF have joined since September 11, 2001 -- and the aim is to keep them in the military for an average of 20 years. SOF operations in Afghanistan have at times been controversial, the subject of criticism from President Hamid Karzai because of civilian casualties. In 2010, then-ISAF Commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal tightened rules of engagement after a series of raids involved civilian deaths, although some units remained exempt from the directive. When he took over, Gen. David Petraeus expanded the use of SOF in an effort to drive the Taliban out of Helmand and Kandahar provinces and blunt the Haqqani network further east. In testimony to Congress in March, Petraeus said: ""We have stepped up the tempo of precise, intelligence-driven operations to capture or kill insurgent leaders....In a typical 90-day period, precision operations by U.S. special-mission units and their Afghan partners alone kill or capture some 360 targeted insurgent leaders."" It appears the Army Rangers were involved in just such a mission in Tangi Valley -- closing in on Taliban commanders meeting in a village -- when they called for reinforcement. Special Operations Forces remain the sharp end of a multi-pronged approach in Afghanistan. Olson said the strategy marries ""the counter-terrorism line of operation and the engagement line of operation -- what's been called village stability operations and the development of Afghan local police trying to return neighborhoods back to the neighbors."" It's become known as ""clear, hold, build, transition"" to win over what are euphemistically called ""under-governed spaces."" Such was the aim of commanders in Tangi two years ago. Lt. Col. Kimo Gallahue, battalion commander for the 2nd Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, told the Armed Forces Press Service in March 2009: ""We'll take the physical terrain from the enemy ... and we'll take the people away, because the people are the prize in this fight."" But even with the surge last year, many areas of Afghanistan rarely see an ISAF soldier. And officers acknowledge that while a platoon can show a presence, it might take a company or more to persuade villagers they are secure. ""Successful counter-insurgency is labor intensive,"" said one officer. One soldier deployed to Tangi Valley wrote of his experiences on the website AssgnmentAfghanistan in January. ""Few of the villagers are openly hostile towards us, but they are always mindful of the Taliban, who move through the valley at night,"" he said. ""They are in a delicate situation -- we Americans have much to offer them, but they know that we will not be in their valley forever, and they know that the (Afghan National Army) and (Afghan National Police) cannot fight the insurgency alone."" Last year, the newspaper Stars and Stripes reported on a planned meeting for farmers in the district. Two officials from the ministry of agriculture in Kabul backed out at the last minute, fearing for their safety, and not a single farmer showed up, ""leaving a handful of American soldiers and a lone U.S. Department of Agriculture representative, sitting on otherwise empty benches in a stiff breeze, with folding tables full of unopened water bottles and unmade tea,"" the paper reported. The phrase commonly used in Afghanistan is: ""The Americans have the watches, but the Taliban have the time.""","The use of U.S. Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan has grown .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration appealed Friday to the U.S. Supreme Court to delay next week's scheduled execution in Texas of a Mexican national convicted of kidnapping, raping and murdering a 16-year-old girl. The execution of Humberto Leal Garcia, who was sentenced to death for the 1994 crimes, ""would place the United States in irreparable breach of its international-law obligation to afford (Leal) review and reconsideration of his claim that his conviction and sentence were prejudiced by Texas authorities' failure to provide consular notification and assistance under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,"" wrote Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., in a friend-of-the-court brief. In a separate document, a letter to Texas Governor Rick Perry, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights asked that he commute the sentence to life in prison, according to Rupert Colville, a spokesman for Navi Pillay. The two requests were based on the failure of Texas authorities to grant the 38-year-old Leal -- who has lived in the United States since he was 2 years old -- access to a Mexican consular official at the time of his arrest. ""The lack of consular assistance and advice raises concerns about whether or not Mr. Leal Garcia's right to a fair trial was fully upheld,"" Colville said. The case ""raises questions"" regarding compliance with a 2004 International Court of Justice ruling in what is known as the Avena case that the United States failed to fulfill its obligations to 51 Mexicans on death row in U.S. jails when it did not inform them of their right to contact their consular representatives ""without delay"" after their arrests, he said. ""If the scheduled execution of Mr. Leal Garcia goes ahead, the United States government will have implemented a death penalty after a trial that did not comply with due process rights,"" said Christof Heyns, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. ""This will be tantamount to an arbitrary deprivation of life."" In its 30-page brief, the Obama administration said that complying with its obligations to notify consuls in such cases would serve U.S. interests as well as those of the condemned man. ""These interests include protecting Americans abroad, fostering cooperation with foreign nations, and demonstrating respect for the international rule of law,"" it said. Evidence introduced at his trial included two statements he made to the police on the day of the murder ""during noncustodial interviews"" that incriminated him. His lawyers have said that the failure of Texas to notify and give him access to the Mexican consul ""required suppression of the incriminating statements he made to the police,"" the filing said. He is scheduled to be put to death Thursday. But the Texas trial court found that, because he was not in custody at the time he gave the statements, Vienna Convention obligations did not apply. The International Court of Justice said the remedy to the 2004 Avena case ""consists in the obligations of the United States of America to provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of (affected) Mexican nationals."" In 2005, then-President George W. Bush said the United States would discharge its obligations under Avena by having state courts address them. That was called into question by a 2008 case that found that ""neither Avena nor the president's memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of subsequent habeas petitions."" But it said that Congress could pass a law addressing the obligations imposed by the Avena decision. That has happened. The administration noted in its filing Friday that the recently introduced Senate bill -- the Consular Notification Compliance Act -- would put the United States into compliance with its international obligations under Avena. It added that, since passage of that legislation by the House may take until early next year, Leal's death sentence should be delayed until then. That argument did not persuade the district court, which noted that ""the filing of proposed legislation which might one day afford petitioner a remedy in the state or federal courts does not, standing alone, justify a stay of execution."" The court of appeals has backed up the lower court, concluding that Leal does not have ""a due process right to remain alive until the proposed Avena legislation becomes law."" But the administration said that going ahead with Leal's execution would cause ""irreparable harm"" to U.S. foreign policy interests by putting the United States ""in irremediable breach"" of its international-law obligation. ""That breach would have serious repercussions for United States foreign relations, law-enforcement and other cooperation with Mexico, and the ability of American citizens traveling abroad to have the benefits of consular assistance in the event of detention.""","Humberto Leal Garcia was sentenced to death for the 1994 rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl .

"Bastrop, Texas (CNN) -- An elite search team joined local officials Wednesday in Bastrop County, Texas, to help look for people who may be trapped in a huge wildfire that has destroyed hundreds of homes. The cause of the Bastrop County fire, one of many burning in Texas, remains under investigation. County Judge Ronnie McDonald said during an afternoon news conference Wednesday that 576 homes had been destroyed in the county and ""that number will increase."" In Leander, Texas, about 60 miles northwest of Bastrop, authorities said a smaller fire this week was believed to be the result of arson. Investigators were searching for four teen suspects -- two boys and two girls, all believed to be 15 to 16 years old -- who were spotted running from the wooded area prior to and during the fire on Monday, the Leander Police Department said. That fire destroyed 11 homes in the Mason Creek North subdivision.  Authorities estimate the damage at $1.4 million, said Connie Watson, spokeswoman for Williamson County. For nearly 300 days, wildfires have been taking a toll on drought-stricken Texas, scorching communities and creating dangerous conditions. A new wildfire broke out in the western part of Camp Bullis, north of San Antonio, Wednesday afternoon, but authorities say it is already half-contained.  At least 125 acres have been burned in the area and 100 homes within a quarter-mile radius have been evacuated, according to Bexar County Fire Marshall Public Information Officer Laura Jesse.   Officials have called in air support to drop water and fire retardant and there is a strike team ahead of the blaze creating fire breaks, Jesse said. An air quality alert was in place Wednesday for San Antonio, Austin, Victoria, Houston and Galveston, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. While winds were relatively calm, humidity was low, expected to be in the ""very dry 10% to 20% range this afternoon,"" said HLN meteorologist Bob Van Dillen. ""That's the real danger today."" Of biggest concern is the Bastrop County Complex fire, which has killed at least two people.  It was 30% contained Wednesday. Authorities were hoping to having the blaze contained by the end of the day Wednesday, said Mike Fischer, the county's emergency management coordinator.  ""We can say we're comfortable the fire won't get any larger,"" he said. The fire, near Austin, began Sunday and has spread across 33,000 acres, forcing the evacuations of at least 5,000 people, officials said. ""Last night was the first night we've had (since the blaze started) with no structures destroyed,"" McDonald said at the afternoon news conference. He identified one of the Bastrop County victims as 48-year-old Michael Troy Farr, a worker in the city of Austin's electrical department. Farr's body was found at his residence, McDonald said. The identity of the second victim was not released. Authorities called on residents to take evacuation orders seriously. ""I cannot emphasize enough to Texans in the impacted areas the importance of heeding all warnings from local officials, especially evacuation orders, as these fires are mean, swift and highly dangerous,"" Gov. Rick Perry said. The 600-member Texas Task Force 1 will assist local officials and first responders, Perry said. A leadership team from the task force arrived Tuesday. ""Based on the needs of local officials, a wide area search team consisting of approximately 100 members and nearly one dozen search canines will be in Bastrop Wednesday morning to work with the local incident management team and assist with search operations,"" Perry's office said in a statement. The announcement did not say that anyone was missing, but said Perry made the decision to send in the team after being ""briefed on the potential loss of life."" A White House statement Wednesday said Perry got a call from President Barack Obama to ""express his concern for citizens of Texas impacted by the unprecedented fires."" The president assured the governor ""that requests for additional assistance, including as recovery begins, would be quickly assessed,"" the statement said. At the local convention center in Bastrop, evacuees were stopping by to pick up supplies and water. ""It's shocking, mostly, not knowing what the end result is going to be,"" Bill Ludwig said. Linda Arebalos said that while her house can be replaced, ""all the memories is what really hurts, hits the heart."" She said she thought about the baby pictures, the things her children made in elementary school, ""the things I put up to save to give to their kids. And it's gone. It hurts."" Jerry Hooten found little more than ashes when he returned to his home and the burned-out shells of cars he had to leave behind. ""We ain't happy about it, but we're all alive,"" said Hooten, who is staying at an RV park outside the danger zone. ""I don't think it's registered in our brains that our house is gone and that, really, half of Bastrop is gone,"" said evacuee Claire Johnson. The two people killed by the blaze were not public safety personnel, according to incident command officials, who declined to offer details. The deaths raise the overall toll from the outbreak of fires to four lives lost. A wildfire killed a woman and her 18-month-old child Sunday when flames engulfed their home near Gladewater, officials said. The Union Chapel fire, 18 miles from the Bastrop fire, appeared to be under control Wednesday, Fischer said. The danger from a fire near Houston -- called the Magnolia fire -- appeared to be lessening for the most populated areas. Officials in Harris County, which includes Houston, said the fire was no longer a threat there. Also, many residents were allowed back into their homes Tuesday in neighboring Montgomery County. About 4,000 homes in Montgomery had been evacuated, according to Lt. Dan Norris of the county's emergency management office. Firefighters continued to battle hot spots in Montgomery, but the bulk of the problems from the Magnolia fire appeared to be centered in Waller and Grimes counties, Norris said. So far in 2011, 7.2 million acres of grass, scrub and forest have burned in wildfires nationwide. Of those, some 3.5 million acres -- nearly half -- have been in Texas, according to Inciweb, a fire-tracking website maintained by state and federal agencies. More than 2,000 firefighters are working fires across the state, said Tom Boggus, director of the Texas Forest Service. The drought in Texas has cost the state an estimated $5 billion this year in loss of crops and livestock, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. ""Now fires are adding to that number.""

"(CNN) -- Police in California arrested Wednesday a woman they said is suspected of killing a nursing student who was last seen in a hospital parking garage more than three months ago. Giselle Esteban, 27, was arrested in Union City, California, Wednesday, Lt. Roger Keener of the Hayward Police Department told reporters. Evidence -- including blood stains, security camera footage, cell phone records and DNA found on a shoe -- led to Esteban's arrest ""for the murder of Michelle Le,"" Keener said. Esteban was arraigned on Wednesday afternoon and was listed as an inmate in an Alameda County jail without bail. Le, a 26-year-old nursing student, disappeared on May 27 after telling classmates at a hospital in Hawyard, California, that she was going to get something from her car, Keener said. She never returned and the abandoned vehicle was later found about a half-mile away. Investigators searched Esteban's house shortly after Le disappeared. As part of that search, Keener said, they found Le's DNA on one of Esteban's shoes. Police have classified the case as a homicide, but her family has held out hope for her safe return, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Le's family has offered a $100,000 reward for her return or for information on her whereabouts. ""At this point she is still missing and we will fight to bring her home every day until we have her with our family again,"" cousin Krystine Dinh told reporters after police announced Esteban's arrest Wednesday. Le's 23-year-old brother, Michael, told reporters that Thursday will be his birthday -- a day his sister would always call him. ""I just want to hear her voice so badly, and the only thing I'm going to be wishing for is for her to come back home,"" he said. Keener pledged that police would continue their search.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Russia's policies are putting it on a path to isolation and irrelevance, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Thursday. Rice also said that Moscow's other behavior, including using oil and gas as a weapon, threatening countries with nuclear attack, selling arms to rogue states and political persecution of journalists and dissidents, paints a picture of ""a Russia increasingly authoritarian at home and aggressive abroad."" Her comments came in a speech on the state of relations between Washington and Moscow. While the United States has taken issue with Russia's behavior for some time, Rice called its invasion of Georgia last month a ""critical moment for Russia and the world."" She warned that Moscow's international standing following the Georgia conflict is at a post-Cold War low. ""Russia's invasion of Georgia has achieved -- and will achieve -- no strategic objective,"" Rice said. ""Russia's leaders will not accomplish their primary war aim of removing Georgia's government. And our strategic goal now is to make it clear to Russia's leaders that their choices are putting Russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance."" The United States and Europe will stand up to Russia and not allow it to bully or threaten its neighbors, she said. While the international community has pledged to help rebuild Georgia and provide massive international aid, Rice said Russia has precious little international support. Noting that Russia's recognition of independence for the Georgia breakaway region of South Ossetia has only been matched by Nicaragua and Hamas, she retorted, ""A pat on the back from Daniel Ortega and Hamas is hardly a diplomatic triumph. "" Warning about the consequences of Russia's actions, Rice said the United States has more options than during the Cold War ""when U.S. foreign policy was hostage"" to the standoff with the Soviet Union. Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is at risk, Rice said, and the country's civil nuclear cooperation with the United States is ""not going anywhere now."" As Russian economic markets continue to take a tumble, Rice warned, Russia needs to be part of the world political and economic community to realize the forward-looking vision laid out by President Dmitry Medvedev when he took office. ""If Russia ever wants to be more than just an energy supplier, its leaders have to recognize a hard truth: Russia depends on the world for its success, and it cannot change that,"" she said. She also took a jab at Russia's recent overtures to Cuba and bomber exercises with Venezuela. The U.S. agenda to help democracies in the Western Hemisphere prosper ""will in no way be diminished by a few, aging Blackjack bombers, visiting one of Latin America's few autocracies, which are themselves being left behind by an increasingly peaceful, prosperous and democratic hemisphere."" Rice's aides have heavily promoted her speech, inviting Russia experts and journalists to the State Department on Wednesday to preview the remarks. On Wednesday, Rice called Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to let him know she was planning to deliver the speech, her spokesman Sean McCormack said. The speech also was to be translated into Russian, French and German, McCormack said. In her remarks, Rice said the United States will continue to welcome students, political reformers, journalists and other professionals as well as try to help Russia in areas such as the fight against HIV/AIDS. ""And we will continue to support all Russians who want a future of liberty for their great nation,"" she said. At a CNN panel discussion Tuesday, former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell and James Baker warned the Bush administration against rupturing its relationship with Russia over the Georgia conflict, saying that the United States needed Moscow's cooperation on major national security issues.","U.S. secretary of state decries Russia's foreign, energy policies .

"(CNN) -- Hockey or debt ceiling? Watching both are Canadian national pastimes these days, especially for businessmen such as Marty Cutler. Except, the political show comes with a big dose of concern. Like many Canadians, Cutler, owner of Fairmount Books in Toronto, said he feels quiet pride from closely following American politics and knowing his country is generally free of the acerbic partisan wrangling of its powerhouse southern neighbor. But he fears a U.S. default, if it were to occur, would be sure to hit home hard. ""The whole thing drives us a little crazy,"" he said. ""You're the elephant and we're the mouse: when you roll over we can get crushed."" More than 50% of Fairmount Books' business is in the United States. If Washington can't find a way to break the debt ceiling impasse, folks like Cutler could pay a heavy price. Nobody can predict the precise global consequences of a U.S. default, but several economic experts said the ensuing panic could fall hard on Canada, the United States' largest trading partner. A default would likely lead to a downgrading of America's stellar AAA-credit rating, which could send interest rates -- the cost of borrowing -- skyward. In a worst-case scenario, this would grind bank lending to a halt, slowing economic activity and plunging the United States -- where Canada does 75% of its trading -- back into recession, according to Jack Mintz, a professor of public policy at the University of Calgary. With approximately 20% of world GDP comprised in America, the international business community has a lot riding on the debt negotiations, Mintz said. But Canadian businessmen such as John Larsen, whose business is also heavily dependent on American customers, may have more to lose than most. ""It would be devastating, no doubt about it,"" said Larsen, chief executive officer Larsen & Shaw, a company that makes hinges in Walkerton, Ontario. Roughly one in five jobs in Canada is dependent on the United States, said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. ""Any material change to the U.S. economy is quickly felt on this side of the border,"" he said. ""There is a sense of pride in Canada's regulatory, financial and political systems ... but Canadians can't afford to laugh off the troubles in the U.S.,"" he said. ""It doesn't take too long for an economic weakness south of the border to send our own economy into trouble."" For this reason, Catherine Swift, president of Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said her organization has intently followed the debt ceiling talks. The uncertainty has even driven up the value of the Canadian dollar. ""That's going to kick the pants out of (Canadian) exporters,"" she said. ""Some are saying that Canada would become more of a safe haven for investments, but that's a financial market thing. In terms of the real economy, this is bad news."" Canada is already feeling the reverberations. The Toronto Stock Exchange fell more than 450 points this week and reached a one-month low Friday amid the uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling talks. Perhaps in an attempt to assuage worries, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said this week that he was ""relatively confident"" the United States will raise the debt ceiling. But he warned that America's broader deficit gap would remain a long-term problem that could hurt Canada as well. ""We're a trading nation and it matters to us that our most important trading partner has their fiscal house in order,"" Flaherty said. Compared to the United States and Europe -- where several countries are saddled with deficit crises -- Canada is on a clear path to a balanced budget by 2014, Flaherty said. ""Canada looks relatively good on the world stage,"" he said. Asked if Canada had contingency plans for a default, Flaherty said, ""What we are doing in Canada is what we're able to do in Canada."" Still, some Canadian business owners expressed frustration with what they called American fiscal recklessness and its impact on Canadians. ""I'm not surprised, given the reputation of Americans to be arrogant, that they are once again in this crisis situation,"" said Megan Halprin, part-owner of Snowflake, a clothing retailer based in Vancouver that does about a quarter of its business in the United States. In her view, Americans ""seem to attract crises."" Canadians, she said, are conservative. Whatever their nature, Canadian businessman ought to be paying close attention to the drama unfolding in Washington, said Don Atkinson of Atkinson Maple Syrup Supplies. A default, he said, would have a ""horrible ripple effect"" in Canada. But Atkinson was sure Canadians would survive a default of any magnitude. Chalk that up to old-fashioned principles. ""We pay down our debt,"" he said, ""and don't buy based on credit, as you do in the United States.""","Canadian businessmen fear a U.S. default would hit their nation hard .

Messi has been handed the responsibility by new Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella after their disappointing Copa America campaign. They went out in the quarterfinals to eventual winners Uruguay, costing then coach Sergio Batista his job. ""He is the captain from now on,"" Sabella told gathered reporters Wednesday ahead of the match in the 120,000 capacity Salt Lake stadium in Kolkata. ""We are looking to build a couple of options, looking for one or two players to build up a combination with him.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Terrorists intent on striking commercial aircraft have shown renewed interest in surgically implanting explosives in humans to circumvent airport security, a U.S. security official tells CNN. The idea of implanting bombs has been discussed in the past, but the United States has obtained fresh intelligence about the desire of terrorists to implant devices, according to the official. Another U.S. official said Ibrahim Hasan al-Asiri, the top bomb maker for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), is suspected of being behind the latest efforts. ""He's AQAP's bomb guy,"" said the official. Asiri is also believed to be behind the thwarted 2009 Christmas day ""underwear"" bomb, the failed October 2010 cargo plane bomb and an attempt to kill a Saudi prince using a concealed bomb . Both officials said there is no specific or imminent threat. But the new intelligence prompted officials last week to brief international airlines and U.S. allies overseas, a Transportation Security Administration spokesman said. ""We are treating this information seriously, and as a precautionary matter, sharing it with our colleagues overseas and of course U.S. carriers who travel overseas,"" TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN. ""We see this as the latest iteration or the evolution of what terrorist groups are trying to do to circumvent our security layers and to perhaps defeat our societal norms,"" he said. ""The information is that terrorists are aware of this type of technique and interested in using it, but there is no specific threat as to a date and time and a specific flight,"" he said. The TSA said full-body scanners can not see underneath skin, but said other ""overlapping layers of security"" could help officials deter any plot involving a human bomb. Those layers include intelligence information about possible plots, equipment that checks for minute traces of explosives, behavior detection officers and canine teams. ""All of those layers of security gives us the strongest defense and the best opportunity to detect and deter this from happening,"" Pistole said Wednesday. TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said passengers flying from international locations to U.S. destinations may notice additional security measures in place. Measures may include interaction with passengers, in addition to the use of other screening methods such as pat-downs and the use of enhanced tools and technologies, Kimball said. ""These measures are designed to be unpredictable, so passengers should not expect to see the same activity at every international airport,"" Kimball said. A trauma surgeon contacted by CNN said terrorists could use a variety of techniques to conceal bombs in a human, ranging from crude surgery that would likely result in infections, fever and other complications, to more sophisticated procedures that would take greater skill, but could last a long time before causing problems. Terrorists could replicate a cosmetic device, such as a breast or buttock implant, said Dr. Jack Sava, of the Washington Hospital Center. ""In many types of infections after surgery, there can be a kind of honeymoon period of a few days. But once you get several days after the operation, I think that's when you'd start to see signs that would begin with pain and fever. That would get worse and worse, and ultimately be fatal if nothing were done,"" he said. An aviation security consultant said news of terrorists' interest in implants shows the ""continuous competition between terrorists and the defenders, where we always try to be one step ahead, and they try to do the same."" ""I think we have come to the point where our technology capabilities have been exhausted to the limit, and right now there's no further technology that can be applied to mitigate this kind of risk,"" said consultant Rafi Ron. The TSA does not have the option of subjecting people to medical doses of X-rays to find concealed objects, he said. ""So we are very much now one step behind (terrorists), rather than one step ahead."" Ron said the TSA is right to focus more attention on airline passengers, instead of on the bags they carry. A person with an implant bomb would likely exhibit signs of stress that could be detected by trained personnel, Ron said. ""One thing obviously is an elevated level of stress, and in (the case of a human bomb) it would probably be extreme,"" Ron said. ""You may also see some influence of drugs to ease pain.""

"(CNN) -- Ousted Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali was sentenced Monday to 15 and a half years in prison on charges related to the alleged discovery of weapons, archaeological artifacts and illegal drugs -- including marijuana -- in his country's presidential palace. Ben Ali's one-day trial and sentencing were conducted in absentia. The former strongman and his wife, Leila Trabelsi, have been living in exile in Saudi Arabia since the January revolt that ended his 23-year rule and touched off a wave of uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East. Both Ben Ali and Trabelsi were sentenced last month to 35 years in prison on corruption charges. In addition to the prison term, the court imposed a fine of 91 million dinars ($65 million). Ben Ali and members of his inner circle are also facing a series of charges relating to alleged murder and torture. Those charges have been referred to a Tunisian military court, according to the state news agency TAP. Monday's trial -- initially scheduled to begin Thursday -- was held in a packed courtroom in Tunis. Hosni Beji, one of the lawyers representing Ben Ali, earlier asked the presiding judge, Touhami Hafi, to postpone the trial in part to give him time to persuade the former ruler to return to Tunisia. Beji said he is planning to meet Ben Ali in Saudi Arabia on Friday. Beji's request, which was refused, triggered a series of angry outbursts from other people in the courtroom. Ben Ali had ruled Tunisia since 1987. Protests began to erupt in December after the self-immolation of a fruit vendor whose cart had been seized by police. The vendor's fiery suicide touched off a firestorm among Tunisians fed up with corruption, high unemployment and escalating food prices. The revolt that followed left at least 300 people dead and 700 wounded, a United Nations human rights expert recently said. The former strongman's political party has since been dissolved by a court order, and parliamentary elections have been scheduled for this month. Ben Ali argued in June that he has been unfairly portrayed and discredited by political opponents seeking to make a break with their country's past. In a written statement released by one of his attorneys, Ben Ali said he was ""tired of being made a scapegoat"" and is a victim of ""injustice."" The former leader said that searches of his official and personal offices were ""merely stage dressing"" meant to discredit him. Contrary to the assertions of his opponents, Ben Ali argued that he worked for what he thought ""was the good of the Tunisian people, improving living standards and progressing on the path to modernity.""

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Three men were detained in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Thursday following a deadly blast outside the Delhi High Court a day earlier, police said. Islamic extremist group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami claimed responsibility for the attack in an email to several TV news channels. ""We are questioning the owner of a cyber cafe and some other people to establish the identity of the email sender, said K. Rajendra, a police director. ""We can confirm the email was sent from Kistwar area."" Eleven people were killed Wednesday when a bomb inside a briefcase went off outside the court, the Home Ministry said. An additional 74 people were injured. It was the second explosion outside the court complex in four months. The NIA, a security agency set up after the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, has joined the investigation along with police and the National Security Guard. The blast took place mid-morning, after the court opened and shortly before cases usually begin. It was a particularly busy day at the court. Wednesdays are dubbed ""public interest litigation"" days, when many members of the public arrive to put cases before judges.

"(CNN) -- Dozens of 911 calls released Wednesday by the Carson City, Nevada, Sheriff's Office capture the horror of a mass shooting at an IHOP restaurant. In one call, a woman sobs as she tries to give the location of the shooter who fatally shot four others before he killed himself in the parking lot. Others seemed to be left almost speechless by the trauma as they give descriptions and accounts. ""Hurry send ambulances,"" one woman pleads. ""There are people dead."" A total of 11 people were shot Tuesday, Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong said. They included five uniformed Army National Guard members and six civilians. Three Guard members, a civilian woman and suspect Eduardo Sencion, 32, were killed. Authorities were investigating the motive Wednesday. Family members told authorities that Sencion had a history of mental problems dating back to age 16, a law enforcement official said. Sencion was carrying an assault rifle and a pistol when he went into the IHOP Tuesday morning, Furlong said. Ralph Swagler, owner of the nearby Locals Barbecue, told 911 that the shooter, who wore a red shirt and black pants, was carrying automatic weapons. ""Now he is coming back outside with a gun,"" Swagler said. ""He is shooting people in the parking lot!"" At that point, the businessman yells for his son to get out of the way. A burst of gunfire is then heard outside the IHOP. ""He is shooting at us now,"" said Swagler, who declined to speak Wednesday with CNN about the incident. ""Automatic weapons. He is shooting at everybody."" A second assault rifle was found in Sencion's vehicle, according to authorities. Only the assault rifle he carried was fired, the sheriff said. An IHOP customer talked with 911 operators as he looked inside the restaurant's window after the rampage. ""Oh my God, we've got (expletive) people down."" Sencion, who had no prior criminal history, continued firing in the restaurant's parking lot after shooting the IHOP patrons. Four nearby businesses were hit by gunfire, Furlong said. Emergency operators remained poised during the barrage of 911 calls. ""We've got help on the way,"" they assured eyewitnesses. ""It was crazy,"" said one witness calling from IHOP. ""It was like a nightmare."" Furlong said he was the second person to arrive on the scene Tuesday morning. He held a woman shot in the head. ""The scene was horrific. It's something that I've never experienced before,"" the sheriff said. ""It looked like a bloodbath, wall-to-wall carnage."" Investigators are trying to determine whether Sencion obtained the AK-47 used in the shooting lawfully. The released calls include conversations between law enforcement personnel, who are told they need to be on the lookout for possible additional shooters. Sencion acted alone, authorities learned. In one call, an officer is asked if more assistance is needed. ""At this point we have the scene under control,"" was the reply.

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona began the defense of their La Liga crown with a convincing 5-0 win over Villarreal in the Nou Camp Monday night. Goals from new recruits Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez followed an opener from the promising Thiago Alcantara. Lionel Messi then added a double for Pep Guardiola's all-conquering team who have already added to their trophy cabinet with victories in the Spanish Super Cup and European Super Cup before the start of their league campaign. Arch-rivals Real Madrid opened their title bid with a 6-0 rout of Real Zaragoza Sunday and Barca were just as impressive once youth team graduate and Spanish under-21 international Thiago had set them on the way with a 25th minute opener. Home goalkeeper Victor Valdes made a brilliant save to deny Giuseppe Rossi in a rare Villarreal attack before the champions stretched their lead. Fabregas, who combined superbly with Messi in midfield, used that understanding to latch on to a neat through ball from the Argentine ace and add the second just before halftime. Any hopes of a Villarreal comeback were snuffed out quickly after the break as Chile winger Sanchez used his pace to burst clear of the visiting defense and notch the third. Messi weaved his way to add the fourth and fifth to add the icing on the cake for the three-time defending Spanish champions.","Barcelona open La Liga campaign with 5-0 rout of Villarreal .

"(CNN) -- World and Olympic champion sprinter Usain Bolt had to battle hard to win the 100 meters race at the Diamond League meeting in Monaco on Friday. The Jamaican, who will defend three titles at the World Athletics Championships in South Korea starting at the end of next month, was far from top form as he edged out compatriot Nesta Carter. However, the 24-year-old still set his season's best time of 9.88 seconds despite his poor start to the race, while Carter clocked 9.90. It was 0.3s slower than his world record and 0.1s behind the 2011 leading time by fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell, who heads the series' point standings. ""I came into the race but didn't execute well. I had to work hard and concentrate,"" Bolt told reporters after his final 100m warm-up before the August 27-September 4 world event in Daegu. ""There are some little things to work on. I have time before the world championships and I will continue to do my best. I'm almost back to 100% on the final 60m and I've got to work on the first half. I'll take it one step at a time and hopefully the next race will be better."" American Michael Rodgers was third in 9.96 ahead of a third Jamaican, Michael Frater, who clocked 10.01.

"(CNN) -- The ATP have announced an increase in the prize fund available to male tennis stars on the ATP World Tour which will see the total amount available exceed $90 million by 2014. The ATP's annual season-ending World Tour Finals event -- held at London's O2 Arena since 2009 -- will see a 30% increase in prize money, with the amount given to the eight participating players set to soar to $6.5m over the next three years. The prize money in the Tour's nine Masters 1000 events, which take place in cities such as Cincinnati, Paris, Rome and Shanghai, will also receive a significant boost with a 9% rise. A bonus pool accessible to the world's top 12 players will rise by 33%, from $6m to $8m. In a statement on their official web site, the organization said the monetary increase reflects the sport's current wealth of talent. ""We are privileged to be experiencing a golden era in men's professional tennis,"" said the body's executive chairman and president Adam Helfant. ""It is fitting that the commitment and excellence of the players is recognized and rewarded in this way. ""We are very pleased to have reached this agreement that reflects the fact that business across the ATP World Tour is stronger than ever."" The planned increases will not affect the prize fund at the tennis season's four grand slams -- The Australian, U.S., and French Opens and Wimbledon.

"(CNN) -- In the age of digital audio, what does good old-fashioned radio still have to offer? Teca Lima, the voice of RadarCultura, consults the Web site before talking into the mic. Plenty, according to the creators of RadarCultura, a community-based Web site and a daily three-hour AM radio program broadcast from Brazil's São Paulo. ""Radio is 'now,'"" says 22-year-old Brazilian André Avorio, who implemented the Web site. ""[Radio] is generally quick and live. This adds a special dynamic to the medium. Moreover, it is still one of the most popular means of mass communication in Brazil. Combining it with the power of the Internet can result in many new possibilities."" RadarCultura is an experimental project of the Padre Anchieta Foundation to promote public participation in audio-visual programming, eventually aiming to fuse its radio, television and Web programs into a single interactive, real-time platform. Like many online music sites, RadarCultura is always looking for new music and emerging talents, but its primary focus is to preserve the memory of the Brazilian repertoire by resurfacing classic, forgotten or unknown songs. The Padre Anchieta Foundation also happens to boast the biggest archive of Brazilian music in Brazil, including more than 15,000 songs dating from the 1920's to the present. ""Making it easy to search through the vast archive of songs was an important feature since version one of the Web site,"" says Avorio. Producer Alceu Maynard observes two types of RadarCultura members: ""There are people who listen to the show because they are fans of Brazilian music. There are others who like to produce the content on our site -- they collaborate actively with suggestions, playlists and all aspects of programming."" Meanwhile, RadarCultura team members Alceu, speaker Teca Lima and project manager Lia Rangel are busy podcasting interviews, moderating conversations, blogging, twittering and keeping the site relevant. Old media gets new blood . True to its non-visual origin, RadarCultura's Web site is strictly text-based, with icons that link to votes and streaming audio. And true to its Web-based platform, the site has adopted, and adapted, all Net-native systems for its daily operations. The site itself runs on the free Drupal content-management system, which allows content to rank and flow according to input and feedback from the site's online community. Members who wish to contribute their own audio material to RadarCultura's archive must either podcast it themselves first, or else they may upload it to the U.S.-based Archive.org to clear it of online rights. Given the quantity of music aired from the ever-expanding repertoire, copyright issues are the most common pretext to negotiation, most notably with ECAD, a privately owned civil society for the collection and distribution of copyright managed by 10 Brazilian music associations. Online, however, RadarCultura distributes the entirety of its streaming content under a Creative Commons license. The team has also been experimenting with the free CoveritLive software to enable live blogging, chatting and Twittering among audience, presenters and guests during its online coverage of radio and TV events, including the popular Roda Vivo TV show. RadarCultura's first live event coverage in February 2008 was of Campus Party Brasil, a seven-day tech-fest that saw people camping out in tents with broadband cables while sharing ideas and technological innovations. In April 2008, RadarCultura struck again with its live coverage of Virada Cultural, Brazil's largest cultural event, including art performances and exhibits in the streets of São Paulo during 24 continuous hours, attracting some 4 million people. ""I came up with the idea of inviting the audience to report directly from the streets using their mobile phones,"" says Avorio. ""A telephone system was installed, and the calls from the participants were automatically recorded. Our non-stop production team listened to every recording as they arrived and not only immediately published them online but geo-localized them on an interactive map of São Paulo. ""It was RadarCultura's first truly collaborative coverage, as the audience produced most of the interviews and reviews, of not only the main attractions of Virada Cultural, but also the very obscure ones that otherwise would not be covered by the mainstream media."" Next: Music for the masses, on demand . But still much remains to be done with RadarCultura's original content -- music. ""Due to legal restrictions, it has been very difficult to exploit many of the possibilities previously imagined for the RadarCultura Web site, like listening online to playlists or to the thousands of songs in the archive,"" Avorio reflects. ""Live radio has been a great success and will remain so for a long time, but it is now clear the value of on-demand content -- whenever you want it, wherever you are, on whatever device you have handy -- from the iPod to your mobile phone."" RadarCultura's Web site not only introduces Brazilian music and culture to the international online community, it brings its programming well beyond the limited broadcasting range of the station's native São Paulo to the rest of Brazil. In a nation notorious for violence rooted in social inequality, the democracy of the Web -- not unlike radio -- is a welcome new medium of communication. ""Certainly São Paulo is the most 'wired' city in the country, but the Internet and the possibilities associated with it have reached the most distant towns,"" says Avorio. ""It is amazing the value that such a technology delivers to a country in a fast development pace such as Brazil -- from education to more subtle ways of social inclusion."" For Gioconda Bordon, Padre Anchieta Foundation's radio coordinator, RadarCultura's most memorable moment took place on December 17, 2008, when the program celebrated its first anniversary. ""We had here in our studio the great composer Tom Zé, a very well-known musician, singing and talking live with a very young singer, Mallu Magalhães, a teenager, actually,"" she recalls. ""The listeners were as happy as we were and, of course, as moved as the two artists were. It was a day in our history.""","RadarCultura is a daily 3-hour radio program and community Web site .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish warplanes carried out a second night of airstrikes against suspected Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq, as deadly clashes erupted within Turkey between security forces and guerrilla fighters. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq expressed concern Friday about the Turkish cross border raids. In an interview with CNN, Kawa Mahmoud called on Turkey to resolve its long-simmering conflict with Kurdish separatist through diplomacy, not violence. ""We always emphasize that shelling (the) Iraqi border is inconsistent with international conventions and good neighborly relations, and we consider it as intervention and disregard for the sovereignty of the Kurdish and Iraqi territory,"" Mahmoud said, adding ""the bombings directly affect the infrastructure of the region of (Iraqi) Kurdistan."" In a news release Friday, the Turkish military said warplanes and artillery pounded more than 100 targets in rugged mountains of northern Iraq where fighters of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) have long been active. The Turkish armed forces periodically target what Ankara calls PKK ""safe havens"" and ""attack bases"" in northern Iraq. For more than a decade, these remote border regions have been beyond the authority of the Iraqi central government as well as of the semi-autonomous Kurdish administration that governs the northern part of the country. In the meantime, Turkish officials told CNN two more Turkish soldiers were killed in clashes in a remote region of south-eastern Siirt province Thursday night. An official from the Siirt governor's office, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said suspected rebel fighters carried out two night-time attacks on local gendarme stations and government buildings using ""rocket launchers and long-range weapons."" The official said two Turkish soldiers were killed and four wounded in the fighting. He said three rebels including a female fighter were also killed in the clashes. Dozens of Turkish soldiers have been killed over the last month, in a clear escalation of the conflict that has raged intermittently between Kurdish separatists and the Turkish state since 1984. More than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict, many of them ethnic Kurds. The Kurds are Turkey's largest ethnic minority. For decades, Ankara imposed oppressive policies, which banned Kurdish names and language and sometimes referred to the community as ""mountain Turks."" The government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has attempted to improve relations with Turkey's Kurds in recent years by launching a Kurdish channel on state television and acknowledging ""mistakes were made"" in the way Ankara treated the minorities. But tensions have escalated between Erdogan's government and the main Kurdish nationalist political party in recent months. After winning a larger number of seats in June parliamentary elections, the main Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) boycotted the swearing-in ceremony for new lawmakers. Kurdish lawmakers are protesting a decision by Turkey's electoral board, which disqualified a prominent Kurdish candidate from participating in the June election. Politician Hatip Dicle was barred from running due to a 20-month prison sentence he received for ""making propaganda for a terrorist organization,"" a Turkish reference to the PKK. Meanwhile, riots involving Kurdish youths have periodically erupted in recent months in Istanbul and other Turkish cities.","Turkish military said it pounded more than 100 targets in northern Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid confirmed the signing of Fabio Coentrao from Benfica on Tuesday, with the Portugal international signing a six-year deal. The 23-year-old defender is the fifth new signing to arrive at the Bernabeu since the off-season transfer window opened with the culmination of the most recent league campaign. The left-back, who was one of his country's stand-out performers at the 2010 World Cup, said it was a dream come true to join the nine-time European champions. ""Every footballer dreams of playing for Real Madrid,"" the defender told Real's official web site. ""I wanted to since I was a child. I used to imagine playing for this team. It was my dream and it has now come true. I hope to earn continuity and to show people I'm ready to play here."" The move will see Coentrao link up with his compatriot Jose Mourinho, the head coach who led Los Blancos to second place in the Spanish First Division last season. ""He is the best coach in the world,"" Coentrao said of the former Chelsea and Inter Milan boss. ""It makes me proud to have the chance to work with him."" Coentrao, who previously played in Spain during a loan spell with Real Zaragoza in 2008, has played for Portugal on 12 occasions since making his debut in 2009. Coentrao joins fellow new arrivals at Real, Turkish international duo Nuri Sahin and Hamit Altintop, who moved from Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich respectively. Winger Jose Callejon has arrived from Espanyol and young French defender Raphael Varane has been signed from Lens. Elsewhere, Manchester City completed their second signing of the week after Roberto Mancini's team announced the acquisition of Montenegro defender Stefan Savic. The 20-year-old joins the City of Manchester Stadium outfit from Partizan Belgrade on a four-year contract. Savic's arrival comes just two days after the Citizens completed a deal for left-back Gael Clichy, who moved from English Premier League rivals Arsenal. The center-back faced a number of his new teammates during Montenegro's 0-0 draw with England in October 2010, and is looking forward to working with so many international players. ""I never imagined that I'd be teammates with all those City players within a year and I'm so happy to be at this club,"" Savic told City's web site. ""I watch the Premier League all the time and I know it's the place to be so I am just looking forward to helping this club achieve great things. We have an incredible stadium and I've seen how passionate the City fans are many times on TV. ""Montenegro play England later this year so I'm expecting to have some great banter with the England lads. I'm just really happy to be a City player."" There was also transfer activity at Inter Milan on Wednesday, as they agreed a deal with Argentine team Velez Sarsfield for attacker Ricardo Alvarez. Inter have agreed to pay $17m for 90% of the 23-year-old's contract with an option to purchase the remaining 10% at a later date, according to Velez's web site.

Kinect, which launches on November 4, is Microsoft's answer to the Nintendo Wii's motion controllers, which helped turn that console into one of this generation's most popular gaming devices. Both Sony and Microsoft have been playing catch-up with the PlayStation Move and Kinect, respectively. Seventeen Kinect-enabled games will be available when the device makes its debut next month. Here's the full list: . Kinect Adventures: This is the game that is included with every Kinect device. It helps introduce gamers to the Kinect interface, letting them transverse the rapids, float around in space and challenge their friends to races, among other minigames. Kinectimals: Think Nintendogs, but with no controller. Game Party: In Motion: This includes a collection of party minigames like Darts.

"(CNN) -- Fascinating, vibrant and multicultural. Those are a just a few of the words Dubai's visitors use to capture its essence. You can never prepare for how the ever-shifting landscape will seek to change something within you as well. The larger-than-life grandeur of its towering city skyline, fleet of construction cranes signaling progress and crowded, fragrant souks -- or markets -- all combine to present the swirling scene of Dubai. But in order to soak up Dubai's eclectic diversity, you have to prepare for another truth: ""Dubai is worth a trip, but not all that glitters is gold,"" iReporter Holger Bauer said. Knowing how to navigate the city is key to making the most of your trip. But don't let a fear of the unknown keep you from setting off on a Dubai adventure. ""It's a crossroads of many cultures,"" iReporter Derek Matthew Koebbe said. ""They have a 30-year plan to become one of the largest economic and tourist regions in the world. I would love to travel there again to see this progression."" Dubai's captivating mystique, beauty . City with a view . For first-timers or repeat visitors, taking in the breathtaking view of Dubai from the top of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, is a must. ""You can get a very good view and 'lay of the land' by going up to the top floors of buildings, such as hotels or the Burj Khalifa,"" Anderson said. ""Going to the viewing deck of the Burj Khalifa in the evening is especially magical. You can view the nightlife below as well as the dancing fountains show, which is absolutely spectacular at night."" iReporter Sara Ruedy recommends taking the elevator ride up to the 160th floor for a 360-degree view of Dubai's overall splendor. And while visiting the Burj Khalifa, located in the heart of downtown Dubai, don't forget to explore the ""large variety of trendy restaurants, aesthetic pools and fountains, and upscale shopping,"" she said. What to do, where to go . Dubai is full of activities that cater to any traveler's whimsy. From the adventurous recreationalist to the avid shopper, this city is a treasure trove just waiting to be explored. ""The malls are epicenters of activity and entertainment, from indoor ice skating and downhill skiing to aquariums, and of course, the high-end luxury shops,"" Anderson said. Dubai is known for its array of fountains, so take the time to stop and enjoy the show. The Dubai Mall, the largest mall in the world, features a choreographed fountain show, according to Anderson. ""One of the best ways to view the shows, which run regularly throughout the day, is to grab a seat for lunch or dinner at one of the restaurants in the mall with outside terrace seating. The food is delicious as well!"" Ruedy agrees with Anderson when it comes to the food at Dubai's main mall. ""I ate at a Lebanese restaurant named Karam Beirut within The Dubai Mall. The restaurant was unique in that large plates of every fresh vegetable you can think of were provided during the meal, creating a hearty and healthy eating experience."" Dubai, home of the extravagant, also has the world's only 7-star hotel, the Burj Al Arab. But if you can't afford a stay in 7-star luxury, the city has other agreeable options. ""I would recommend staying at any of the Jumeirah properties, as they are on the beach,"" Koebbe said. ""They have Burj Al Arab as well as the very affordable Madinat Jumeirah. The Madinat has a water park called Wadi Wadi that kids really enjoy! The property also has a replica of a traditional souk with over 40 shops and restaurants."" If you haven't satisfied your shopping needs at the world's largest mall, don't forget to browse Dubai's souks. ""Another must see is the gold and spice souks near Dubai Creek,"" Koebbe said. ""Be ready to bargain because they raise the prices for any foreigners."" 30 days, 30 kitchens: Making food in the UAE . How to explore . Before you begin, consider Dubai's climate. Koebbe captures it best: ""Think of Florida's humidity combined with Arizona's heat. Average summer temps are 100-plus with 80% humidity. The best time to travel there is between November and March when the highs are in the 80s and the humidity is lower."" Once you get there, take a ride on the Dubai bus system for a fun way to sightsee. Getting around the city for a dime each trip is easy on your wallet, and it helps you connect with the locals and tourists around you, Bauer said. If you want to explore Dubai's more natural offerings, get outside the city. The countryside and deserts are a nice balance for the towering skyline. ""It's wonderful to get into the countryside and see Al Ain or Abu Dhabi, not far away,"" iReporter Eric Kossoff said. ""We took a half day tour with Arabian Adventures called 'The Sun Downer,'"" Koebbe said. ""They pick you up a few hours before sunset from your hotel and take you into the Al Sahara Desert where you visit a traditional Bedouin camp. The camp provided everything from camel rides to hookahs and traditional foods along with belly dancers."" Take in the diversity . If you take one thing with you from your Dubai experience, let it be the culture. You won't find a replacement for it anywhere on Earth. ""Dubai is such a beautiful and uniquely diverse destination,"" Koebbe said. ""Wandering through the souks, you hear people speaking in Arabic, British and American English, Hindi, Russian, French and even Chinese. The city has both an old and new feel all around it. ""Wonderful smells of the spice souk are wafting around you mixing with the fragrances of some of the finest perfumes Europe has to offer. You'll find older traditional souks on one corner, then on the next, the very American-like Mall of the Emirates with an indoor ski resort, Ski Dubai. I found the local people to be very warm and welcoming.""","A thriving downtown of towering buildings and crowded markets awaits travelers in Dubai .

"(CNN) -- Independence for South Sudan is around the corner, but new satellite images released Wednesday reveal a heavy north Sudanese military presence in an oil-rich border region. Images from the U.S.-based Satellite Sentinel Project showed an apparent Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) convoy of ""significant size"" traveling through the town of Kadugli. The monitoring group, started by actor George Clooney, said the convoy was 2 kilometers in length and had about 1,000 troops. There were heavy transport trucks carrying artillery. ""Less than a week after signing yet another agreement, the Sudanese regime appears to be ignoring its commitment, holding to form, and positioning military assets for intensified offensive operations,"" said John Prendergast, co-founder of the Enough Project, which aims to end genocide and war crimes. ""This cycle will continue to be played out with increasingly destructive results for Sudanese civilians until the international community stiffens its spine and imposes swift and severe repercussions for the endless cycle of violence the Khartoum regime continues to fuel."" The Satellite Sentinel Project combines satellite imagery analysis and field reports with mapping technology in hopes of deterring the resumption of the bloody and bitter civil war north and south fought for decades. The monitoring group said regular fighting between the Sudanese forces and the south's Sudan People's Liberation Army has been reported in the city of Kadugli in the past week. Southerners voted for independence in a January referendum, and with the scheduled July 9 date of separation looming, many fear an escalation of bloodshed could bring both sides back to the brink of full scale war. Violence erupted two months ago along the contested border area of Abyei and subsequently in South Kordofan, a state that lies north of the border but where many people, especially in the Nuba Mountains, are allied with the south. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes, and many fear that after strict borders go into place with independence, they will not be able to return home. ""South Sudan will be born into crisis,"" said Susan Purdin, who oversees International Rescue Committee aid programs in South Sudan. ""Widening violence is triggering more displacement, threatening the lives of vulnerable civilians and hampering access to communities in need while an existing humanitarian emergency grows worse,"" she said. Critical issues -- including oil and the final status of Abyei -- remain unresolved just days ahead of independence. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States applauded talks between north and south but remained concerned about the unresolved matters. ""The United States also calls on the parties to end the fighting in Southern Kordofan, and to facilitate unfettered access for aid workers to deliver humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians affected by the conflict,"" Nuland said. Discussions are under way on how to shape the new post-independence U.N. mission in South Sudan, created in 2005 with a peacekeeping mandate. And the United Nations Security Council will meet next week to discuss whether to recommend a new member state's entry into the global body. Peter Wittig, the U.N. ambassador of Germany, which holds the rotating Security Council presidency this month, said Council members will meet July 13, four days after South Sudan's independence ceremony, to talk about U.N. admission. If granted, South Sudan would become the first state since Montenegro in 2006 to become a U.N. member. CNN's Moni Basu and Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","New satellite images show a Sudanese military presence in South Kordofan .

"United Nations (CNN) -- In a contentious closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday, Russia criticized France's decision to airlift weapons to rebel forces in Libya, according to a Western diplomat present during the discussions. Earlier Tuesday, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet told reporters that parachute drops of weapons into the North African nation were ""no longer necessary"" because opposition forces had become organized enough to procure their own arms. Rebels battling Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are ""becoming more autonomous,"" Longuet said. ""This autonomy allows them to build relationships with external partners, including when it comes to equipping themselves in self-defense,"" he said. But even as Longuet said the weapons drops were no longer needed, debate over the approach continued. Russia brought up the issue at the U.N. Security Council session Tuesday, arguing that by sending weapons, France had violated the council's resolution that authorized NATO force in Libya, the Western diplomat said. France offered a detailed defense of the country's actions, arguing that supplying weapons was ""the only practical way of fulfilling"" the council's mandate authorizing force to take ""all necessary measures"" to protect civilians, the diplomat said. During Tuesday's meeting, ambassadors from the United Kingdom and United States defended France's actions, according to the Western diplomat. France acknowledged last Wednesday that it had supplied weapons to anti-Gadhafi forces, saying the weapons were provided for self-defense. ""It became clear that people there were defenseless and very much threatened by Gadhafi's forces,"" French Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel Thierry Burkhard said last Wednesday. Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi told reporters last week that rebel forces were receiving arms from France but were not trained in their use. He said it was reckless of France to take such action, saying it went ""against all of the proclaimed aims of NATO's intervention in Libya."" Meanwhile, in Libya, a rebel spokesman said fighting had moved Tuesday westward from Misrata, which rebel forces say they continue to hold. Eleven rebels were killed in Dafniya, and one was killed in Zliten, said Mohammed Ibrahim, the spokesman. Another 60 rebels were wounded in the two cities, he said, citing figures from Al-Hekma Hospital, in Misrata. Pro-Gadhafi forces fired some six rockets into Misrata, but they caused no casualties, he said. The opposition website freemisurata.com, published by Ibrahim's group, said at least 20 members of Gadhafi's forces were killed and six were captured Tuesday in Dafniya and Zliten. CNN's Richard Roth and Mick B. Krever and journalists Catherine Clifford and Dheepthi Namasivayam contributed to this report.","Russia argues that France violated a U.N.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The words ""Ganbaro Nippon"" -- ""Be strong, Japan"" -- shine down on the nation's capital nightly from the soaring steel of the landmark Tokyo Tower. But a society known worldwide for its culture of stoicism has been knocked a bit off balance by the one-two punch of a massive earthquake and a nuclear disaster, according to both ordinary residents and experts. Andrew Grimes, a clinical psychologist working in Japan, said the events and their literal and figurative aftershocks have had ""a severe effect on people's sense of security."" ""It's uncharted territory to some extent,"" Grimes said. ""But I think the mental health aspect is already with us, and it's going to stay with us for a while."" And Junichi Onodera, the director of a badly damaged hospital in northern Japan, said the disaster's psychological scars will linger longer than the current crises. Onodera runs the Iwate Prefectural Hospital in Yamada, a town in the bulls-eye for the tsunami that followed the March 11 earthquake. Seaweed still drapes cabinets on the first floor of the facility, and X-ray machines, beds and wheelchairs too badly damaged to salvage line the parking lot. Exhausted doctors and nurses whose homes have been destroyed sleep alongside patients, many of whom arrive suffering from what Onodera likens to post-traumatic stress disorder. ""But what can we do?"" he asked. ""There are no psychologists here to help with that."" The quake killed more than 13,000 people in the region. Another 15,000-plus are still missing, and Japanese troops are still combing the ruins of coastal villages in search of bodies. The island nation has long been plagued by earthquakes. But last month's magnitude 9 quake has generated strong aftershocks for more than a month, with more than eight deaths blamed on fresh tremors in the past week. ""The degree of fear of earthquakes has risen up these days,"" Tokyo businessman Ryuji Kita told CNN. Kita said the repeated aftershocks have put his entire family on edge, and he gets e-mails from friends and relatives in western Japan after each temblor. In Tokyo, more than 300 km (190 miles) south of the quake's worst impact, the disaster was followed by a brief period of rolling blackouts and an extended campaign of power conservation. Outside a nightclub around the corner from the Kantei, the prime minister's office, a sign advises passerby, ""Save power and carry on"" -- an echo of iconic British posters from World War II. Many subway stations have been half-lit, and when baseball returned after delaying the start of its season for three weeks, many games played in the Tokyo Electric Power Company's service area were moved to afternoons. Tokyo Electric faces a 20% capacity shortfall since the quake knocked out two of its nuclear power plants. One of those is Fukushima Daiichi, the center of a slow-motion crisis that Japan declared a top-scale nuclear accident Tuesday. Yoshi Domoto, executive director of the Atlanta-based Japan-America Society of Georgia, said the Japanese have been sticking together, as they have through a long history of disasters. ""They're more group-oriented than Americans, so that's helping them out,"" Domoto said. That sense of community leaves people less isolated than they would be otherwise, said Professor Lonny Carlile of the Center for Japanese Studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Neighborhoods tend to come together, accounting for residents, handing out circulars, or holding regular cleanups. After the tsunami, local governments quickly designated which towns would take in survivors from other towns that were hit, Carlile said. ""You have what in essence is a routine (that will) kick in during an emergency,"" Carlile said. And in the United States, expatriates are raising money for disaster relief. The Japanese community in Los Angeles is so large that Japanese prefectures have their own local organizations, said Gwen Muranaka, English editor of the Rafu Shimpo, a daily Japanese-American newspaper there. ""I think there's a real commitment,"" she said. ""This isn't going to go away in a month. People feel that they're committed to helping."" But in the shadow of Fukushima Daiichi, fears about possible contamination of the basics of life --- food and water -- have fueled an ""enormous inability to calm down,"" said Grimes, the director of Tokyo Counseling Services. And many people in Tokyo who depend on trains to get around ""are very concerned and afraid of being stuck again, like we all were on that first Friday."" Grimes said psychiatrists and psychologists expect to see an increased number of patients suffering from depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, nightmares and problems with appetite in the coming months. ""We've had many more people first-time people coming in, including couples,"" he said. As the nuclear crisis drags on, both the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric have faced increasing criticism of their early response and the utility's inability to offer an estimate of when it might be resolved. Prime Minister Naoto Kan's ruling Democratic Party of Japan took a beating in the first round of local elections Sunday, losses he said Tuesday were ""very difficult for our party."" And with the crisis also pinching Japan's economy, Kan urged citizens to ease up on some self-imposed austerity measures. ""While keeping sympathy with the disaster victims, shall we try not to apply too much self restraint and go back to daily life?"" he asked. ""Consuming products from the disaster-hit area is one way of supporting the victims."" The Japanese government has begun easing restrictions on produce from the stricken region as radiation readings go down. Vendors selling vegetables and fruit from Fukushima Prefecture were doing a land-office business outside Tokyo's packed Shimbashi subway station at Wednesday's rush hour, with some stands selling out in minutes, their operators announced. A woman named Shiho, who would not give her last name, told CNN she was more worried about continued earthquakes than radiation. She said she was worried about how to evacuate with her two cats, since pets weren't allowed in shelters, and had stockpiled food and water for an emergency kit in case of another major quake. ""The government is confused about what they should do,"" she said. ""We need a clear scenario to recover. If we Japanese people could have a clear vision about how to recover, then the recovery would be more effective."" CNN's Brian Walker in Yamada, Matt Smith, Yoko Wakatsuki and Noriaki Kawai in Tokyo and Melissa Gray in Atlanta contributed to this report.","The mental health impact of twin disasters is ""uncharted territory,"" psychologist says .

"(CNN)  -- Hosts Argentina needed a stunning late strike from substitute Sergio Aguero to salvage a 1-1 draw against Bolivia in the Copa America opener Friday night. Argentina could not break down the underdogs in the first half and just two minutes after the break it was Bolivia who took a shock lead as Edivaldo Rojas backheeled a corner past Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero. Marcelo Martins might have put the game out of Argentina's reach as he beat the offside trap but Romero was alert to push the ball away from him before saving a follow-up effort. A jittery Argentina, with Lionel Messi well below his best, had to wait until 13 minutes from time for the equalizer. Nicolas Burdisso chested down a cross from Marcos Rojo and Atletico Madrid star Aguero volleyed home spectacularly. Aguero had a late chance to give the hosts an undeserved win but Bolivia goalkeeper Carlos Arias saved smartly. The opening match of the 12-team tournament was held in La Plata and a win for Argentina, with the likes of Messi and Carlos Tevez in their ranks, was considered almost a foregone conclusion by the home faithful. But Bolivia played to the standard that had seen them humiliate Argentina 6-1 in the high altitude of La Paz during the last round of World Cup qualifying. ""It is not what we expected, now we must improve and win our remaining matches,"" Barcelona star Messi told gathered reporters after the draw. Argentina's arch-rivals Brazil will be looking to win their fifth Copa America title in six and open against Venezuela on Sunday. The 12 teams are divided into three groups of four, with the top two in each group and the two best third-placed teams reaching the quarterfinal knockout stage.","Copa America hosts Argentina held 1-1 by Bolivia in tournament opener .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Before Prince William and his wife, Catherine, left Los Angeles to return to London on Sunday, they got their hands dirty with paint and putty at a children's art center and shook hands with military veterans looking for work. ""On behalf of us both, how grateful we are to have been welcomed so warmly in the Golden State and City of Angels,"" Prince William said at the last stop of the royal couple's three-day Southern California visit. A giant Union Jack flag and an equally large American flag served as the backdrop inside Sony Studios' sound stage 15 as Prince William addressed 1,500 military veterans, their spouses and recruiters from 150 companies Sunday afternoon. The cavernous building is where scenes for the ""Wizard of Oz,"" ""Spider Man"" and many other movies were filmed. William called the ServiceNation job fair ""one of the seriously most important"" of the many events during their 12-day North American tour. ""This is because it's about men and women, who with their own free will, choose to put their life on the line for their country,"" William said. ""They are on the front line of a remarkable relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, which has safeguarded our freedom for a century."" The problem of unemployment among former military families will ""be raised monumentally by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge being here,"" said U.S. Chamber of Commerce Vice President Kevin Schmiegel, one of the job fair organizers. ""Prince William is the most recognizable military officer in the world,"" Schmiegel said. ""So, I think if they look at the portfolio of things that they're interested in raising awareness about, it makes sense that he is interested in this."" William said the job fair's mission is ""very immediate and personal to us. Catherine and I both have friends back in Britain who could benefit from an initiative like this."" Earlier Sunday, William and Catherine spent an hour in Los Angeles' low-income Skid Row neighborhood with children at the Inner-City Arts Center. Each got their hands dirty creating their own art. ""What the hell is that?"" William asked Catherine as he looked at her artwork. His wife was painting a snail as she sat among a group of fifth-graders. ""That's amazing,"" Catherine said to children as she admired their work in a ceramics class. The royal newlyweds left a lasting impression at the center, literally. They each put their hands onto a board of putty, leaving ceramic imprints for future visitors to see. Their whirlwind weekend in Southern California was designed to be a combination of commerce and charity missions for the royal couple. Weekend events included the prince's participation in a polo competition in Carpinteria, California, on Saturday afternoon. Prince William and his team won the match after he scored four goals in the final game. His reward? A sterling silver and gold trophy along with a kiss by his wife. Proceeds from the match go to a foundation supported by the prince and his brother, Harry, that helps disadvantaged youth, sustainable development and military families. The royal couple has had a busy stay, which included a meeting with thespians and Hollywood's elite during an event by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts on Saturday night. While Beverly Hills is the land of the famous, the visit by the recently married couple has caused a major stir. Spago, Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, offered a British menu for the duration, including dishes served during the royal wedding festivities. The Beverly Hills eatery added Yorkshire pudding to its menu for the weekend. Not to be outdone, the city's famously aggressive paparazzi tried to pursue the newlyweds at a private party at the British consul general's Hollywood home. Neighbors near the residence, where the royals also spent the night, gave police permission to arrest photographers caught on private property. The California visit ends the 10-day North American tour that began in Canada.

"(CNN) -- A top African-American lawmaker urged President Barack Obama on Thursday to focus more attention on the plight of unemployed black Americans, warning that there is growing frustration with the administration among some of its staunchest backers. ""We love the president,"" Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, told CNN. ""We're working with him but are sounding the alarm."" The national unemployment rate was 9.1% in July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But it was nearly 16% for African-Americans, a figure Waters said was the highest in the nation of any key demographic and the worst since the Great Depression. ""We are unique in terms of the pain that we are feeling in our community,"" said Waters, a key member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Earlier this week, Waters questioned Obama's failure to visit any predominantly African-American communities during his Midwest bus tour. The president visited Minnesota, Iowa and his home state of Illinois from Monday to Wednesday. Waters, a veteran legislator, told a Detroit crowd that some black lawmakers have been reluctant to criticize the nation's first African-American president. ""You are very proud to have a black man as president,"" Waters said in remarks captured on the Grio website, an African-American news site. There is concern, she said, that ""if we go after the president too hard, you are going after us."" Voices in the crowd could be heard imploring Waters to press Obama on issues like unemployment. ""When you unleash us ... and tell us it is all right to have this conversation, we are ready to have this conversation,"" Waters said. ""We're supportive of the president, but we're getting tired. ... The unemployment is unconscionable (and) we don't know what the strategy is."" During her interview with CNN on Thursday, Waters pushed the president to take what she characterized as a tougher stance against conservative tea party activists. An increasing number of progressives have complained that Obama was too willing to compromise with conservatives in recent debt ceiling and related budget negotiations. ""We have to let the president know we're behind him,"" Waters said. ""Don't back up from the tea party. Stand up and fight them. Don't give in to them. Don't make deals with them because you are trying to get along."" ""We want the president to know that he's got a lot of people behind him,"" Waters added. ""We're hurting, and we're getting angry. ... Let the president know that we want him to be tough."" CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Rep.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's health minister said Tuesday he was misquoted by the media in comments made at an AIDS conference that homosexuality is ""unnatural"" and a ""disease"" that was brought into India. Ghulam Nabi Azad told reporters that his remarks were intended to urge those who engage in homosexuality to be careful. He appeared to be backtracking a day after he unleashed widespread outrage . ""Unfortunately, there a disease in the world and which has come to our country which is absolutely unnatural and should not happen but it does,"" Azad said at a New Delhi conference on AIDS and HIV. ""There is a substantial number of men having sex with men in our country. But it's difficult to track who's doing it and where,"" he said in a speech delivered in Hindi. Azad's comments drew criticism from gay rights activists and those who fight HIV in India. ""I think his statement is very irresponsible, more so because of the platform he was speaking from,"" said Anjali Gopalan, executive director of the nonprofit Naz Foundation that fights for sexual rights. ""The minister should have used that platform to end stigmas. Rather he chose it to reinforce the negative stereotypes,"" she added. Roy Wadia, the executive director of India's Heroes Project, said Azad's comments ""not only undermines the ministry the person leads, but strikes a significant blow to health and outreach programs aimed at an already vulnerable and stigmatised population."" Wadia, whose HIV/AIDS communications and advocacy organisation is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, welcomed the outcry against Azad's comments. ""That is encouraging,"" he said. ""But we clearly have a ways to go in educating society as a whole when the top health official of the world's most populous democracy utters such words and does such harm."" The United Nations AIDS agency, which estimates 2.5 million Indians are living with HIV, reiterated its position on homosexuality. ""There is no place for stigma and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,"" said Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, in a statement Tuesday as he praised India's overall efforts in providing HIV services to gay and transgender communities. ""Consistent with WHO's disease classification, UNAIDS does not regard homosexuality as a disease,"" Sidibe added. In 2009, New Delhi's high court decriminalized same-sex relationships in a landmark ruling that sparked religious outcry in conservative India. The ruling meant the law -- Indian penal code section 377, which had criminalized consensual homosexual acts between adults -- was partly overturned but remains in place where forced homosexual acts are concerned. Several religious groups opposed to legalizing gay sex challenged the verdict in India's supreme court. Tuesday, Amnesty International said India must do it all it can to protect the rights of gay citizens. ""These outrageous remarks linking consensual sexual activity to a disease simply encourage discrimination against men who have sex with men,"" said Emily Gray, Amnesty International's researcher on sexual orientation. The rights group said the health minister ought to retract his comments. ""India has come a long way in the past decade in protecting its vulnerable populations, including its lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations,"" Gray said. ""But they are engaging in double standards here: On the one hand, they have decriminalized homosexuality and taken a significant step toward ensuring that people in India can express their sexual orientation. On the other hand, its chief public health officer is pathologizing homosexuality.""

The FA Cup triumph represented City's first trophy in 35 years. City's chief executive officer Gary Cook hailed the agreement as a sign of the team's continued development. ""We are delighted to be expanding our relationship with Etihad Airways through this comprehensive partnership agreement,"" he said. ""Most importantly, in addition to delivering significant revenue at a key stage in the club's evolution, the agreement creates exciting opportunities for our two organizations to cooperate more deeply commercially and on media and community initiatives in the future."" The deal with Etihad has seen the two-time English champions further strengthen their links with the United Arab Emirates, after the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan in August 2008. On the pitch, City this week completed the signings of France left-back Gael Clichy from Arsenal and Serbia defender Stefan Savic from Partizan Belgrade.","Manchester City have announced a 10-year naming rights agreement with Etihad Airways .

"(CNN) -- Don Black said he despises Barack Obama. And he said he believes illegal aliens undermine the economic fabric of the United States. A cross and swastika are burned at an event called Hated and Proud in Nebraska in July 2008. Black, a 55-year-old former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard, isn't the only person who holds such firm beliefs, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which Thursday released its annual hate group report. The center's report, ""The Year in Hate,""  found the number of hate groups grew by 54 percent since 2000. The study identified 926 hate groups -- defined as groups with beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people -- active in 2008. That's a 4 percent jump, adding 38 more than the year before. What makes this year's report different is that hate groups have found two more things to be angry about --  the nation's first African-American president and an economy that is hemorrhaging jobs. For the past decade, Latino immigration has fueled the growth of hate groups.  Watch what the family of a hate crime victim has to say » . ""We fear these conditions will favor the growth of these groups in the future,"" said Mark Potok, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project. ""In the long arch of history, we are definitely moving forward, but these kinds of events can produce backlashes."" Black claims the number of registered members and readers on his white nationalist Web site surged to unprecedented levels in recent months. On the day after Obama's historic election, more than 2,000 people joined his Web site, a remarkable increase from the approximately 80 new members a day he was getting, Black said. His Web site, which was started in 1995, is one of the oldest and largest hate group sites. The site received so many hits that it crashed after election results were announced. The site boasts 110,000 registered members today, Black said. ""People who had been a little more complacent and kind of upset became more motivated to do something,"" said Black, who also said he joined his first hate group at age 15. Hate groups cited by the law center include white nationalists as well as neo-Confederates, neo-Nazis, skinheads, Klansman and black separatists. Skinheads and Klansman saw an increase in membership, while neo-Nazi groups saw a slight decline, according to the law center's report. Most of the hate groups are located in the South, but the state with the highest number of documented hate groups is California with 84. Obama serves as a ""visual aid"" that is helping respark a sense of purpose in current supporters and lure new members, said neo-Nazi David Duke, the former Klan leader who was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in the 1980s. Duke said he fears ""the white European-American"" heritage will soon be destroyed. He added that his Web site sees around 40,000 unique visitors a day, up from 15,000 a day before Obama won the election. Racist anger toward Obama was evident even before he became president. Two weeks before Obama won, authorities said they foiled a skinhead plot to assassinate him. The two suspects, based in Tennessee, also apparently planned to shoot and decapitate dozens of African-Americans, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said. Police say a man in Brockton, Massachusetts, allegedly targeted minorities after President Obama's inauguration. They say the man raped a woman, killed her sister and another man after several months of researching white supremacist groups on the Internet. White supremacist groups have gained traction, a reversal from the decline the groups experienced since 2000, according to the law center report. One of the smaller Ku Klux Klan groups, the United Northern and Southern Knights, more than doubled its chapters, widening its geographic reach from eight to 24 states, according to the report. The image of a black man in the White House angers white racists, who fear nonwhites gaining too much power, said Jack Glaser, associate professor of public policy at the University of California-Berkeley. But racist fears can also be more mundane and personal: Nonwhites in the White House could lead to nonwhites in their neighborhoods, which could lead to interracial dating, a great taboo among hate groups. ""Obama poses a large cultural threat to white racists,"" Glaser said. ""This may explain some of the uptick in hate groups."" Immigrants are another target of hate groups, according to the report. In a deteriorating economy, illegal immigrants have been blamed by hate groups for allegedly taking subprime loans, according to the report. Scapegoating occurs most often in times of economic distress, according to experts studying hate crimes. From the Holocaust in Europe to abuses against Irish Catholic immigrants in the 1830s in the United States, people are most likely to lash out against others when they feel vulnerable or need to displace their economic frustrations on others, psychologists say.   In the city of Detroit, Michigan, where the weak economy has taken a particularly devastating toll, Jeff Schoep serves as the commander for the National Socialist Movement, one of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the United States. Schoep said he has seen membership grow by 40 percent in recent months, mostly because of the dire economic circumstances. It is the ""most dramatic growth"" he has seen since he joined the movement in the mid-1990s. The group does not reveal membership numbers to the media, he said. ""You have an American work force facing massive unemployment,"" Schoep said. ""And you have presidents and politicians flinging open the borders telling them to take the few jobs left while our men are in soup kitchens."" Experts studying hate crimes say there is no reliable way to link the growing number of hate groups with an increase in hate crimes, since many of the attacks go unreported. The FBI's uniform crime report found 7,163 hate crime incidents in 2005. However, a special report by the government that same year said the number could be 10 times higher because many of the crimes aren't reported. The most recent FBI statistics in 2007 saw a slight uptick in hate crimes to 7,624. Some hate groups such as the National Socialist Movement do not publicly condone violence or terrorist acts.""Violence is absolutely counterproductive,"" said Duke, the former Louisiana legislator and neo-Nazi. But experts say there is a link between joining a hate group and committing violent crimes. Last week in New Orleans, Louisiana, a grand jury indicted four people in the alleged shooting of a woman who tried to leave a Ku Klux Klan initiation, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported.  More commonly, members of hate groups engage in vandalism such as an incident in Los Angeles, California, this month where vandals slashed tires and sprayed the word ""Nazi"" on two cars and a house, according to the center. The attack occurred in a neighborhood with signs displaying support for Obama. Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studied the issue of hate crimes, said people in hate groups can feel paranoid about a specific group of people. This panic leads them to feel threatened, and they may react with violence, he said. Alternately, individuals in a hate group may sometimes transplant their own personal rage onto a particular group that has no real connection to the cause of that rage, he said. ""Their thinking is very distorted,"" Poussaint said. CNN's Stephen Samaniego contributed to this report.","Report: the number of hate groups grew by 54 percent since 2000 .

"(CNN) -- Any time there's a change in the Whoverse (the intergalactic space that occupies the storylines of British sci-fi show ""Doctor Who"" and its spinoffs, ""The Sarah Jane Adventures"" and ""Torchwood""), fans of the franchise get nervous. And creator Russell T. Davies is bringing quite a change to ""Torchwood."" (The name is an anagram of ""Doctor Who."") ""Torchwood"" fans have been jonesing for more of series star John Barrowman's antics as Capt. Jack Harkness for the past two years. During the prolonged hiatus, Davies aligned the franchise with subscription cable channel Starz and moved the entire setting of the show from the U.K. to the U.S. Fans are curious about what's happened to their favorite characters in the meantime and what a bigger budget could mean for the show. ""Torchwood"" started in 2006 as a BBC prime-time sci-fi show about a character and investigative team that originated on the popular ""Doctor Who"" reboot. Barrowman's character is a mysterious, immortal man from the 51st century who adopted the identity of a World War II Royal Air Force pilot and ultimately ended up protecting mankind with the help of a secretive alien-hunting team of Earthlings. This season of ""Torchwood,"" titled ""Miracle Day,"" airs at 10 p.m. ET Friday night on Starz. The season begins with a supernatural occurrence that halts human death on the entire planet. Actress Eve Myles returns as Gwen Cooper, and American actors Mekhi Phifer, Bill Pullman and Alexa Havins join the cast. The last season of the series, titled ""Torchwood: Children of Earth,"" was broadcast in 2009, and the storyline followed the decimation of Capt. Jack's Torchwood team, including the painful loss of his romantic partner, Ianto Jones. At the end of ""Torchwood: Children of Earth,"" the surviving team was officially disbanded. ""The last time we saw Jack, he was drowning his sorrows in the 'Doctor Who' version of the 'Star Wars' cantina,"" said Jennifer Steele, a 29-year-old Whoverse fan and Alta Language Services project manager in Atlanta. So what brought Capt. Jack back to Earth for ""Miracle Day""? Barrowman isn't spoiling the surprise -- which he says changes everything -- but wants fans to rest assured that the quirky, silly heart of ""Torchwood"" is back. ""Whatever issues he had, he's gone off and dealt with, and now he's come back refreshed and raring and ready to go,"" Barrowman said. And so is his libido. Barrowman is keen to point out that fans will see Capt. Jack have ""full-on man sex in this series,"" which shouldn't shock sci-fi fans in the least. ""That's what makes science-fiction fans so brilliant,"" Barrowman said. ""They are accepting about different people and the differences between each other. I am a fan myself. We're all quirky. We're all a little nerdy. We're all a little different-looking than everybody else. We might have some little foible; we might have some little obsession, but you know what, as fans of science-fiction, we all understand that about each other."" Barrowman said his point of view on the acceptance of sexualities in television, as a gay man, is the same as that of sci-fi fans. ""If you don't like me for who I am, do I really need to know you? I think that's the attitude that sci-fi fans have, too. We're not going to let people dictate that we should be something other than who we are,"" he said. Relationships have been a hallmark of Davies' work on ""Torchwood"" and ""Doctor Who."" ""I know Russell T. Davies has taken a lot of flak for all the relationships on Doctor Who,"" Steele said, explaining that before Davies rebooted the franchise, the character of the Doctor had been largely asexual since the 1960s. ""Jack Harkness has relationships with everybody, because that's the kind of person he is,"" she said. Capt. Jack famously had a tryst with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fan-favorite James Marsters in the 2008 ""Torchwood"" episode ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang."" Marsters played Capt. John Hart, Harkness' former partner and a time-traveling bad boy. ""It was a great moment. I loved it,"" Barrowman said. ""Walking through the saloon doors, right up to each other, looking like we're just going to punch the crap out of each other, and then they kiss! Brilliant!"" The character of Jack Harkness is not necessarily gay or bisexual. ""Despite the fact that Jack is 'try-sexual' -- he'll try anything -- his relationship with Ianto reached a peak in 'Children of Earth,' "" said Edward DeGruy, British sci-fi fan and senior director of guest hospitality for DragonCon, a fan convention in Atlanta. ""When Ianto's sister asked him, 'Well, you're dating this guy; does that mean you're gay?' and Ianto looked at her and said, 'I don't know, but I know I love Jack.' "" That focus on how many people in this world can love one specific person is very nerdy, DeGruy said. ""Sci-fi fans have realized that a relationship is a relationship. However that relationship happens for you is what's important. ""We all have our own beliefs, and fandom believes that one day the world will move in the direction where everyone says, 'Your belief is your belief, and your way of living is your way of living. As long as you're not hurting me, I don't care what you do.' "" And although sci-fi fans deeply identify with the characters on the show, it's the writing on ""Torchwood"" that keeps fans dedicated, DeGruy said. ""Especially to (fans of writer Joss Whedon), because that was Joss' bread and butter. He can write conversations probably better than anyone in the business today. Russell T. Davies being a very close second."" ""I think now that 'Torchwood' has really hit its stride, Davies is doing a better job than he did on 'Doctor Who,' "" Steele said. Barrowman says the secret to the show's success is that the entire creative team is made up of science-fiction fans. ""This is a show with people who are fans of the genre,"" he said, ""with writers who are fans of the characters, with actors who are fans of the history of the show and of science-fiction. It's made by fans, which is incredible.""","""Torchwood"" teams up with Starz for the fourth season, titled ""Miracle Day""

"(CNN) -- A power outage Thursday left more than 1.5 million people in the dark in parts of Southern California, Arizona and Mexico as authorities scrambled to figure out what happened and how to get the lights back on. Authorities said the outage occurred after a high-voltage power line between Arizona and California was tripped out of service, according to a statement released by San Diego Gas & Electric. It was not known what caused the service to be shut off, though authorities said it was not an act of terrorism. Power began to be restored by late evening Thursday, though officials warned it would take until Friday to completely restore power in portions of San Diego and Orange counties. ""Again, it's a slow process. It's going to take a long time to bring the power,"" San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders told reporters. The mayor warned residents in one California's most populous counties to stay off the road and limit cellular phone service, and school was cancelled Friday for thousands of students. San Diego Gas & Electric said all of its 1.4 million customers were without power. The power line break ""caused our line from AZ and from the north of our region to both trip off,"" the utility posted on its Twitter account. ""Think of the system as linked by springs, when one part goes out the rest are affected,"" another Twitter post from the utility said. Power outages in California stretched Thursday from San Clemente in Orange County to the state's border with Mexico, a San Diego County spokesman told CNN. In Arizona, about 56,000 customers in Yuma lost power, Arizona Power and Supply said. Parts of Mexico's Baja California and Sonora states were also without power, Mexican authorities said. The power outage posed no threat to the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station near San Clemente, California, authorities said. At the nuclear power plant, units ""tripped from grid disturbance"" but have offsite power and were in normal shutdown mode, said Eliot Brenner, director of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Office of Public Affairs. The Civil Protection Department in Baja California said authorities there were working to fix a problem at a hydroelectric plant. San Diego County activated its emergency operations center as officials tried to learn more about the blackout, county spokesman Michael Workman said. Linzi Berkowitz in Carlsbad, California, said the widespread power outage wreaked havoc during rush hour. ""The whole city is a mess and hopefully it doesn't get worse,"" she told CNN iReport. Power went out about 3:45 p.m. in San Diego, said Joe Pettigrew, who said he was trapped on the 10th floor of an office building. ""We don't have air conditioning and the windows don't open,"" he said, noting that it was about 80 degrees outside. Rebecca Bloomfield of the San Diego airport authority said the airport was letting only inbound flights land. Outbound flights and security screening were halted due to the power outage. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Alta Spells, Greg Morrison and Tina Burnside and CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","NEW: Mayor: ""It's going to take a long time to bring the power back""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. wants to test claims by Somalia's al Qaeda-linked group Al-Shabaab that it will lift the ban on relief organizations to avoid a humanitarian disaster caused by drought in the Horn of Africa nation, the State Department said Wednesday. The Horn of Africa region is experiencing the worst drought in 60 years, with Somalia experiencing pre-famine conditions. Al-Shabaab said Tuesday it would lift a ban on foreign food agencies in drought-hit areas under its control. The United Nations estimates 2.8 million Somalis need emergency aid. There are currently about 1.5 million internally displaced people, and the drought conditions have driven thousands of Somalis over the border into Kenya and Ethiopia. Al-Shabaab banned foreign aid organizations from operating in the country in 2009, accusing them of being anti-Muslim. On Wednesday it reversed its stand, saying it welcomed help from any group which did not have a hidden agenda and has formed a committee to deal with the situation. The group urged all aid groups to co-ordinate their relief actions with the committee for access and assistance. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that the U.S. was ""very concerned"" about the drought and resulting food shortages. The U.S. has already delivered more than 1,900 metric tons of food aid through the World Food Program. Nuland said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tasked her staff Wednesday with looking at what else can be done to ""avoid a major humanitarian catastrophe,"" including probing whether Al-Shabaab can be taken at its word. ""The secretary wants to ensure we do all we can to avoid a humanitarian disaster, and if Al-Shabaab is now saying it will allow these humanitarian efforts, then the international community should test that because they have been a problem in the past,"" Nuland said.","The al Qaeda-linked group Al-Shabaab says it will lift a ban on aid in Somalia .

"(CNN) -- ""F.E.A.R. 3,"" the latest installment in the action-horror series, aims higher than your typical first-person shooter game. It boasts cool combat features, a spooky paranormal story line and some dramatic tension. But because its emphasis is on combat, not thrills, the game is not nearly as scary as it should be. ""F.E.A.R. 3"" (Day 1 Studios, Warner Bros. Interactive) continues its franchise's story of a family in conflict as two brothers work together to track down their psychically enhanced mother, Alma, who is about to give birth. However, their reasons for wanting to find dear Mom are totally opposite. Filmmaker John Carpenter, director of the classic fright flick ""Halloween,"" helped create cinematics for the game that heighten its fear factor. Comic book horror writer Steve Niles co-wrote the story line. Co-op mode is the preferred mode of play here, allowing you to take advantage of each brother's skills during combat and strive toward the highest score on each level. You can play as Point Man, who is well versed in military training and technique, or as Paxton Fettel, who was slain during the original ""F.E.A.R"" but returns here as a ghost with psychic energy powers. The brothers must navigate wave after wave of soldiers, whacked-out cultists and creepy creatures created from Alma's mind. The battlefields range from a looted food warehouse to the science bunker where Alma is being held. While the action is pretty linear, there are detours in which you can search for hidden weapons and ammo, psychic link gathering locations, and an Alma doll, which scores big points when found. There are enemies who require some extra work to defeat, including one called a Phase Caster, who summons additional soldiers over and over. Kill him first. Seriously. It is easy to get immersed in the run-and-gun aspects of ""F.E.A.R. 3,"" but keep in mind that it's also supposed to be a horror game. Remember, Mom is a psychic time bomb allegedly waiting to erupt when she gives birth to ... whatever. To be sure, there are some very good horror moments in the game. The apparitions that briefly appear, scare and disappear are disconcerting. And having a ghost brother along during solo mode is a constant reminder. When they occur, the terror elements are jump-out-of-your-seat frightening. It is almost like watching a horror movie from the eyes of the lead actor. The problem is those moments don't seem to occur as often as you'd think or hope. There were plenty of times in the game where I forgot it was supposed to be a thriller and not just a shooter. Some levels' features are so combat-heavy that there's no room for any memorable paranormal experiences. Early in the game I was peeking around every corner expecting to find some apparition or twisted scene, only to shrug and move on. By the end of the game, I stopped looking for ghosts and just treated everything as a combat scene. Multiplayer modes help make the game fun to replay. You can work together with your teammates to survive waves of enemies emerging from an advancing fog, or be possessed by Alma and try to take over your former teammates. ""F.E.A.R 3"" is a well-made first-person shooter that will challenge players with intelligent enemies and compelling battles. Sadly, the frights aren't quite as jarring as they could have been. Which, I'm sure, makes the ghosts very sad. Boo. ""F.E.A.R. 3"" is playable on the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It is available now in North America, Australia and the UK. The game is rated M for mature due to blood and gore, intense violence, partial nudity and strong language.

"(CNN) -- Victoria Bol sits under the blazing sun in the soon-to-be world's newest capital of Juba, a city of red soil, winding dirt roads and scattered tin-roofed homes. She watches in delight as children frolic on the streets and women mill about with the new flag of South Sudan wrapped around their shoulders. A few feet away, boisterous neighbors spray the rare paved road with a hose, playing with the soapy suds as they hum the new anthem of a nation on the eve of its birth. ""Oh my goodness, I cannot believe this day is finally here,"" says Bol, a resident of Grand Rapids, Michigan. ""It is very emotional. I'm excited, but I'm also thinking of all the people who died for this to happen."" Bol is among scores who have returned home to witness the birth of South Sudan, as it officially splits from the government based in the north on Saturday. ""The airport is packed and homes are filled with people coming in from all over the world,"" Bol says. ""We lost almost everything -- our relatives, our homes, everything we own -- to get to this point. There was no way I was missing this."" Bol says dozens of her relatives died in the violence. She fled Juba in 1991 as mortars rained from the sky, and has not set foot in her homeland since then. ""We were at the airport trying to leave when the north started bombing nearby,"" she says. ""Everything shook. We all started screaming and hiding."" Sudan's Muslim north has been in conflict with the majority Christian south for decades. The civil war created a class of refugees who drifted in and out of neighboring countries -- many on foot -- to flee violence and famine that left about 2 million people dead. In January, South Sudan voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum to split, which was part of a 2005 peace deal that helped end the war. Dallas resident Abuk Makuac escaped Juba in 1984. ""I wish my many relatives who died in the civil war were here to witness the separation into a new country,"" she says. ""From here on, I know that they did not die in vain."" Scores who fled the long conflict are coming home to a region that has not changed much over the years. The infrastructure is still lacking -- with about 30 miles of paved roads in all of South Sudan, an area the size of Texas. ""It is no Michigan,"" Bol says with a chuckle, ""but it's home, and there is a feeling of solace you get at home that you will never get anywhere else."" Water remains a luxury in most communities and security is still tense, especially in regions bordering the north where violence still rages days before independence. But patriotism trumps the challenges, say the returnees, who gathered this week in Juba to discuss how they will help move their new country forward. Gordon Ajak, who left Sudan in 1989, hopes to capitalize on the opportunities in his homeland after he decides what to invest in. The 46-year-old bought a one-way ticket from Canada, where he works as a counselor. ""I left Sudan because ... we were not wanted by the government in the north,"" he says. ""We have our own country now. It is time to come back to invest and help my people."" Business analysts warn that the minimal infrastructure in South Sudan can lead to a difficult business climate. ""Good business skills will come at a premium and there will be a ferocious demand for talent,"" says Robert Taiwo, director of Whitespace Advisory, a global firm that works with businesses looking to invest in Africa. The rewards, he says, can include unprecedented business opportunities. ""Returning South Sudanese will get an opportunity to shape domestic business ethics and this will ultimately govern the commercial context in which everyone operates,"" he says. Ajak says he is not deterred by the flashes of violence that have flared in South Kordofan, a border area between the northern and southern regions that remains tense ahead of the independence. Other challenges such as the disputed region of Abyei remain, he says, but he is ready to sacrifice for his new homeland. ""Back before I left, I was being attacked in a country that did not want me,"" he says. ""The difference now is I'll be fighting for South Sudan. My own country. I'd rather die for my country than watch them suffer."" James Aguek will not make it home for the festivities, but the Orlando resident is planning to move back permanently. He has already torn his Sudan passport in anticipation of a new one from South Sudan. ""Having a new country gives me a reason to go back,"" the musician says. ""There is no way I would have gone back to that country if we had not voted for the separation."" For now, Aguek will focus on his upcoming album -- one that includes a song called ""99%."" It's a reference to the number that voted for the split.","""It is no Michigan,"" one expatriate says, ""but it's home""

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's military has started rebuilding a church burned down in an outbreak of unrest between Christian Copts and Muslims, a military official told CNN on Sunday. The Shahedin Church in Helwan province south of Cairo, the capital, was burned earlier this month in what was believed to be a feud between a Muslim and Coptic family. Further clashes last Tuesday killed 13 Copts. ""The engineering department of the Egyptian Armed Forces has started to rebuild the church in Atfeeh today at the same exact location,"" Army spokesman Maj. Mohamed Askar said. ""The Armed Forces will bear all expenses."" Meanwhile, thousands of Christians in Cairo have protested outside the offices of the Egyptian state broadcaster for nine consecutive days, demanding the rebuilding of the church and an end to what they call government persecution and discrimination. The Egyptian military previously announced an investigation into the church burning and ensuing violence. Tensions have increased this year between Egypt's Muslim majority and its Coptic minority. A Coptic church in the town of Alexandria was bombed on New Year's Day, killing 23 people. The Palestinian Islamic Army, which has links to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for what was the deadliest attack on Christians in Egypt in recent times. Ten days later, a gunman killed a Christian man and wounded five other Christians on a train in Egypt. Also in January, a man was sentenced for his part in an attack on another Coptic church a year ago, Egypt's state-run Al Ahram newspaper reported. About 9% of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion split with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. CNN's Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","The church burning set off further unrest between Copts and Muslims .

"West Pittston, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The swollen Susquehanna River began receding in northern Pennsylvania on Friday as authorities there and in other eastern U.S. states hit by the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee surveyed the damage. The Susquehanna appeared to crest at 42.66 feet at Wilkes-Barre, said Charles Ross with the National Weather Service in State College, Pennsylvania. Earlier, officials had said the river crested there at 38.83 feet, but that estimate was based on a faulty flood gauge, said Ross. ""Unofficially, it appears to be a crest of record,"" he said, surpassing the previous high set by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Flood stage there is 22 feet, according to the National Weather Service. While the flood-engorged Susquehanna crested in some Pennsylvanian and New York cities, other communities braced for still-higher water levels. The tropical moisture brought floodwaters that have left at least four people dead, caused widespread damage, and prompted police and the National Guard to patrol neighborhoods in an effort to ward off looters. On Thursday, President Barack Obama signed emergency declarations for Pennsylvania and neighboring New York, making federal resources available to respond to the flooding and its aftermath. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo surveyed some of the hardest-hit areas of his state Friday. ""There's no doubt that there is significant damage,"" he said. ""My guess is that there will be thousands of homes that will have sustained damage when all is said and done -- hundreds of businesses."" Cuomo said officials were moving from emergency operations into an assessment phase, but warned residents to remain vigilant. ""Stay off the roads. It's not yet time to go home. The water hasn't receded,"" he said. In Luzerne County, in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, between 65,000 and 70,000 people were ordered to leave their homes as the Susquehanna rose above flood stage, according to Emergency Management Coordinator Stephen Bekanich. The valley has a levee system that tops out at 41 feet, said Drew McLaughlin, a spokesman for the Wilkes-Barre mayor's office. McLaughlin and other officials were examining the levees. ""We're closely monitoring, and it seems they are holding steady,"" he said. ""It's pretty much a ghost town,"" McLaughlin said from south downtown, adding that residents appeared to heed the call to leave. Other Luzerne County communities not protected by the system were not so fortunate. Heavy flooding was reported in West Pittston, Harding and Plymouth Township. ""At this point, we haven't been able to assess that (flooding and damage) because the water is so high,"" Bekanich said. Plymouth Township resident Francis Federici was forced to leave his home, which sat in five feet of floodwaters. ""On a normal day, we love it here,"" he said. ""There's nobody around us. We have a beautiful yard. We were fixing our home up."" Luzerne County Commissioner Maryanne Petrilla told CNN that ""potentially thousands of homes"" have been affected. Shelter space for 4,100 was rapidly being filled, and the county was looking for more space, she said. The area from Ithaca to Syracuse to Utica, in New York, and from Wilkes-Barre, to Scranton, to Monticello, in Pennsylvania, continued to experience major to record flooding, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. An 8-year-old boy died Thursday in East Cocalico Township, Pennsylvania, after he was caught in a storm-water drain, said Cpl. Melissa Arment with the East Cocalico Township police. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead, she said. A 71-year-old man died Wednesday night in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, as he was bailing water out of the basement of his home and the walls of the structure caved in, said Chief Patrick O'Rourke of Derry Township Police. A third person drowned early Thursday near Brickerville in Lancaster County, CNN affiliate WGAL-TV reported. And a fourth person died about 4:30 a.m. Thursday in North Lebanon Township, Pennsylvania, police said. A motorist became stranded in high water and was outside the vehicle when struck by another vehicle, which then left the scene. The suspect and that vehicle were found, authorities said. Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, had received an incredible 15.37 inches of rainfall associated with Lee.  At least six other communities had rainfall totals exceeding 10 inches. Many in the area recalled the flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. That storm dumped as much as 18 inches of rain on the area in two days, destroying more than 68,000 homes and 3,000 businesses, and leaving 220,000 Pennsylvanians homeless. In Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, CNN iReporter Nick Bohacz said flooded roads prevented him from getting to work. Bohacz, who sent in several photos of the flooding, said he saw a line of people outside a hardware store waiting for supplies. The rising Susquehanna and Chenango rivers were also triggering evacuations in upstate New York, where evacuation orders were issued for portions of Binghamton and the towns of Conklin, Endicott, Johnson City, Union and Vestal, according to CNN affiliate YNN-TV. Numerous cities and counties declared a state of emergency. Video from Johnson City showed a flooded shopping mall and a football field with water nearly up to its goalposts. Water was coming over the flood walls in Binghamton, county spokeswoman Colleen Wagner said. About 15,000 people were ordered to evacuate, and about 1,400 were in shelters, she said. State officials sent in food and water. A number of boat rescues have taken place, she said, but she did not know how many. Broome County Emergency Services Director Brett Chellis urged people in the evacuation areas to leave and not return for now. Water was topping flood walls in Union and Vestal as well as Binghamton, he said. In Otego, New York, about 50 miles northeast of Binghamton, CNN iReporter Don Wyckoff captured footage of water cascading down a road. Wyckoff said he was stunned after watching neighbors and family members lose their homes to the floodwaters. ""You are seeing the tiny mill creek rip out culvert pipes and tearing away roads,"" he said. ""We never thought we would see this again. It happened in 2006, but it is worse now."" In Oneonta, on the Susquehanna upstream of Binghamton, Police Chief Gary O'Neill said some roads were washed out and parks flooded, but the water appeared to be receding. On the down side, water was flooding the chief's home in Binghamton. Mandatory evacuations were also in place for low-lying areas near Schenectady, New York, YNN said. In neighboring Montgomery County, authorities closed all roads and county buildings, saying only emergency vehicles would be allowed to travel. The New York State Thruway Authority opened and closed several roads and ramps. In Maryland, areas near Baltimore were also affected. High water blocked dozens of roads in Baltimore County, according to CNN affiliate WMAR-TV. The Prince George's County, Maryland, Fire and EMS Department said it was responding to numerous emergency calls, and nearly two dozen people had been rescued or helped by firefighters and the department's swift-water team. Additional rain is in store for much of the region the next couple of days, with up to an inch forecast through Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. The rain comes on top of the heavy precipitation that has fallen in the region from Hurricane Irene. What's left of Lee stalled across the central Appalachian Mountains and has since drifted into Indiana.

"Near Bani Walid, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's opposition fighters launched an assault on one of Moammar Gadhafi's last bastions of support on Saturday, but they met stiff resistance and some even pulled back, military commanders said . The fighting raged after negotiators failed to work out a deal to surrender the city of Bani Walid, a hardcore Gadhafi stronghold southeast of Tripoli. Fighters believe key members of the ousted Libyan leader's regime -- including two of Gadhafi's sons -- may be hiding. Positioned on the outskirts of the city, Grad rockets and bullets targeted the advancing fighters, some of whom retreated. Others worked to position themselves in advantageous locations. Planes were heard overhead and fighters assumed they were NATO jets because no other aircraft has been allowed in the no-fly zone established by international powers. The National Transitional Council, Libya's new leadership, said it wanted to negotiate the surrender to prevent further bloodshed and destruction, though critics believe it would give Gadhafi's fighters time to entrench themselves within the town. Opposition forces claim Gadhafi loyalists fired on them Friday, hours ahead of a Saturday deadline to lay down their arms. ""The deadline expired yesterday when they fired at our forces with Grad rockets,"" NTC chief negotiator Abdullah Kenshil told CNN. Kenshil said he expects opposition forces to take the town soon but acknowledged the tough resistance by snipers positioned in houses and loyalist forces firing artillery and rockets. Opposition forces have been staging outside the town for nearly two weeks, surrounding it on three sides, while negotiations were under way. Shortly before the Saturday deadline expired, NTC spokesman Shamsuddin Ben Ali said absent a resolution ""it's up to military planners to decide how to move forward."" Sticking points in the negotiation included the demand by Gadhafi loyalists for opposition fighters to enter their communities unarmed, and to refrain from searching houses, Ben Ali said. The loyalists also asked for blanket pardons, but the NTC wanted to prosecute loyalists with blood on their hands, Ben Ali said. Bani Walid is one of three major towns in Libya that remain loyal to Gadhafi. The other towns are Sirte, on the Mediterranean coast, and Sabha, in the southwest of the country. Opposition forces don't know how many Gadhafi loyalists are in Bani Walid, though they believe they are heavily armed with machine guns and rockets, said Abdulrahman Busin, an NTC spokesman. The NTC has previously said it had confirmed reports that two of Gadhafi's sons -- Saif al-Islam and Mutassim -- were seen inside Bani Walid. Saif al-Islam, who was once viewed as Gadhafi's possible successor, is wanted along with his father, for crimes against humanity for a brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters. Mutassim, a defender of his father, served as Gadhafi's national security adviser. Ben Ali also said he received intelligence reports that loyalist forces were moving captured NTC fighters to Qasr Bu Hadi for use as human shields. That town is 10 miles east of Sirte. Loyalists and opposition forces clashed about 55 kilometers (34 miles) outside of Sirte, said NTC media committee spokesman Jalal el Gallal. CNN can not independently verify the reports. The renewed fighting came as Interpol issued Red Notice arrest warrants Friday for Gadhafi, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for alleged crimes against humanity. A Red Notice allows Interpol, the international police agency, to circulate arrest warrants widely with an intention to extradite suspects to the ICC. At the United Nations, Ian Martin, the secretary-general's special envoy to Libya, told reporters that fears of a humanitarian disaster within the capital city have not materialized. Tripoli's infrastructure has suffered little damage, the disruption of the water supply has been largely alleviated, supplies of fuel and electricity are improving, schools are slated to reopen September 17, and there has been no general breakdown of public order, said Martin, who had earlier briefed the Security Council after his return from five days in Libya. ""That's quite a striking conflict with other post-conflict"" cities, he said. But those advances do not minimize the enormous challenges that transitional authorities still face. A Supreme Security Committee has been established in Tripoli to bring all armed elements under a single command, but ""the proliferation of weapons is a major concern, including to Libya's neighbors,"" Martin said. ""The approach they're taking is to, at this stage, tell the very top echelon of the military, the police, the civil service, to remain at home while decisions are taken as to which of them should or should not be part of the future,"" he said. Despite appeals by NTC leaders, acts of revenge have been carried out, ""especially of sub-Saharan Africans accused -- often, I think, quite wrongly -- of having fought for the Gadhafi regime,"" he said. In addition, ""terrible evidence continues to come to light of the deliberate human rights abuses and crimes of the Gadhafi regime, both those that took place over many years and during the fall of Tripoli, when many of the prisoners were massacred,"" Martin said. Meanwhile, an interim government is to be established within 30 days of the declaration of liberation, U.N. envoy Martin said. Until then, the NTC is assuming ""caretaker responsibilities"" to carry out urgently needed functions, he added. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has proposed a support mission for three months, after which ""we would then go back to the Security Council for a longer mandate,"" Martin said. CNN's Phil Black and Ian Lee contributed to this report.","NEW: Some opposition fighters retreated amid tough resistance .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ten years after the September 11th attacks, the nation still isn't fully prepared to handle another huge disaster, Lee Hamilton, one of the co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission, said Thursday. First responders could still have problems communicating with one another, and there is confusion in some communities about who would be in charge, Hamilton told the House Homeland Security Committee. He urged quick action to solve the problems. ""We cannot permit delay of this,"" he said. ""We lost lives at 9/11. We lost lives at Katrina because we were not able to get communication."" The 9/11 Commission recommended concerted action to fix the problem of responder communications, but the problem persists. ""I think it's an urgent question and shame on us, shame on us if we have not solved this problem when the next disaster strikes,"" Hamilton said. Tom Ridge, the first secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said competing measures to deal with the problem are being considered by the House and Senate, while police and fire departments are waiting for some kind of action. ""All they want is a system,"" Ridge said, ""... the opportunity to get voice and data and video over the broadband"" in the event of a terror attack, natural disaster or major accident. The committee's chairman, Rep Peter King, R-New York, said he continues to believe the answer is to set aside a block of wireless telecommunication bands for an emergency communications network. Hamilton said another concern is knowing who is in charge in the event of a disaster. He called it a ""no-brainer"" but added that in metropolitan areas, where many law enforcement and rescue groups would respond in a big emergency, the lines of command are not defined. King held the hearing to assess what progress has been made since the 2001 terror attacks and what still needs to be done. He pointed the finger at Congress -- where he serves -- for not streamlining congressional oversight of the Department of Homeland Security. ""We're sending mixed signals as far as what Congress wants in the area of homeland security, and this fragmentation, to me, is inviting, if not disaster, certainly it's preventing law enforcement and the intelligence agencies from doing the job to the maximum,"" King said. Hamilton also said the Transportation Security Administration and other entities have done a great deal of work on technology to detect all types of explosives but ""we have to accelerate our efforts"" to be able to find bomb materials people carry or could hide inside their bodies. Ridge said the United States has been able to thwart many terror plots, but in some instances it was because the bombers made mistakes and were ineffective. ""Luck is not a strategy,"" he said, warning that the United States must adapt to detect the evolving tactics of terrorists. Hamilton told the panel much progress has been made in the past 10 years, but more needs to be done: ""We are safer today, but not as safe as we could be.""","Communication, lines of command remain problem areas, Lee Hamilton says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Mel Gibson will not have an acting role in a movie about Jewish historical icon Judah Maccabee, although he may direct the film, Gibson's representative said Friday. The possibility of Gibson's involvement in the Warner Bros. Studios production brought harsh reactions from some Jewish leaders in the United States, including Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. ""I think it's, quite frankly, preposterous,"" Hier told CNN on Friday. ""Judah Maccabee is one of the greatest heroes in Jewish history. Mel Gibson is an anti-Semite. He has made anti-Semitic remarks in the past. I don't know what Warner Bros. was thinking."" Maccabee was a Judean priest who commanded the Judean resistance to Greek forces around 165 BC. ""Casting him as a director or star of Judah Maccabee is like casting Bernie Madoff to be the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission,"" Hier said. Gibson's representative, in an email exchange with CNN on Friday, said, ""There are no plans at this stage for Mel to be in the film."" The rep asked not to be identified. ""He is way too old to play the lead character,"" his rep said. ""(The) finished script will determine whether he directs or not but the studio would obviously prefer he direct than not. It's an amazing story that should be told cinematically."" Gibson's rep pointed to his work on ""Braveheart,"" ""Passion of the Christ"" and ""Apocalypto"" as ""all great stories that translate beautifully on the big screen with such a visual filmmaker as Gibson."" Hier disagreed, saying that ""The Passion of the Christ,"" which Gibson produced and directed, depicted every Jew, with the exception of Jesus, as a ""tyrant, buffoon, or an idiot."" Hier alluded to Gibson's infamous rant after his arrest on a drunken driving charge in 2006. The sheriff's arrest report said the actor asked the deputy if he was a Jew and said, ""F---ing Jews. The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world."" ""My anger with Mel Gibson is he has never made efforts to fix his past mistakes,"" Hier said. He said he would have no problem with Gibson becoming involved in a Maccabee movie if he had made amends for what he did. ""They do have the freedom of expression, which we all welcome, don't we?"" Gibson's representative said in response to the criticism.

"(CNN) -- Leonardo Damiao grabbed his first international goal as Brazil beat 10-man Ghana 1-0 in a friendly held in London. Despite its billing, the game was anything but friendly as referee Mike Dean sent off Daniel Opare and produced eight cards in the match. The game was settled just before half time as Damiao latched onto Fernandinho's through ball to fire a shot into the corner of the net from a narrow angle. Victory for the Selecao ensured some breathing space for coach Mario Menezes who has been heavily criticized for Brazil's poor showing in the recent Copa America. In front of a lively crowd at English Premier League side Fulham's Craven Cottage ground in west London, it was Ghana who started the brighter of the two teams. But after Jonathan Mensah headed over from a corner, Brazil began to take control of the game and tempers began to flare. The first booking, for substitute Elias, came on 11 minutes and soon after Opare also saw a yellow card for a crunching tackle on Brazil striker Neymar. Opare was dismissed for a second booking just after the half hour mark after he was adjudged to have tripped Lucio and Brazil assumed total control of the game. Damiao thought he had scored after he finished off Neymar's pass but he was flagged for offside. But in the last minute of the first half he got his first goal for his country as he finished smartly from Fernandinho's expertly weighted pass. The striker, who plays for Internacional, would have had a second had he been able to tuck home Hulk's cross into a gaping net but the ball flew past his outstretched leg. Ronaldinho, formerly of Barcelona and AC Milan, drew a good save from Ghana keeper Adam Kwarasey, as did Alexandre Pato but the game ended being settled by Damiao's goal.","Brazil beat Ghana 1-0 in an international friendly in London .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova headed the pack as four of the top 10 seeds at the Western and Southern Open advanced to the third round of the Cincinnati event with wins on Tuesday. Fourth seed Sharapova, a beaten finalist at the Lindner Family Tennis Center last year, secured her place in the third round with a 6-1 6-3 victory over Australian qualifier Anastasia Rodionova. Sharapova, a three-time grand slam winner, is joined in the next round by French Open champion Li Na. Li, seeded fifth, recorded a straight-sets 6-3 6-4 success against the Czech Republic's Lucia Safarova. Can anybody stop Novak and Serena? The 29-year-old was pleased with her return to form having been eliminated from last week's Rogers Cup in the first round. ""It was tough but I was happy I could win today,"" Li told the WTA Tour's official web site. ""I've been missing a lot of shots so I need some more matches on hard courts. ""It's not one thing like my running, my forehand or backhand -- it's just my timing. I need some more matches to find my timing again."" Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova also enjoyed a victory as the 21-year-old sixth seed disposed of South Africa's Chanelle Scheepers 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. France's Marion Bartoli was the other top 10 seed in action, and the 26-year-old breezed past Ukrainian Alona Bondarenko 6-1 6-2 in just 63 minutes. The first round was completed on Tuesday, with American Serena Williams continuing the form which saw her claim the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Canada last weekend.

"(CNN) -- Germany have become the first team to qualify for next year's European Football Championships after thrashing Austria 6-2 in Gelsenkirchen. Mesut Ozil bagged a brace as the three-time European champions continued their 100% percent record in the campaign. Miroslav Klose opened the scoring in the eighth minute, with Ozil doubling the advantage after 23 minutes. Lukas Podolski made it 3-0 five minutes later before Marko Arnautovic pulled one back for the visitors. Ozil all but sealed victory two minutes after the restart with Andre Schurrle and Mario Gotze adding late goals to cap another impressive German display. ""We got caught out twice defensively, but I think we restricted the Austrians to just two chances and I prefer that we created so many chances,"" German coach Joachim Low said after the game, AFP reported. ""It is our philosophy to constantly attack and we are working all the time to have a team in which we can interchange players. This is what you have to have if you want to be amongst the best in the world,"" Low added, AFP reported. In the other Group A matches, Belgium's chances of qualifying took a knock when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Azerbaijan - Rauf Aliyev's 86th minute equalizer canceling out defender Timmy Simons penalty kick. Turkey consolidated second place in the group with a 2-1 home win against bottom-placed Kazakhstan. Robin Van Persie scored four as the Netherlands put San Marino to the sword with an 11-0 thrashing. Wesley Sneijder and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar both scored twice as the Dutch consolidated their lead at the top of Group E. San Marino have now conceded 44 goals in eight matches without managing a single goal themselves. Hungary are now level on points with Sweden after beating them 2-1 in Budapest. Both teams now have 15 points although Hungary have played a game more. In the other Group E match, Finland beat Moldova 4-1 in Helsinki. Two goals from Wayne Rooney and a first international goal for Gary Cahill helped England to a 3-0 win over Bulgaria in Sofia in Group G. Wales' 2-1 victory over second-placed Montenegro in Cardiff also helped Fabio Capello's men open up a three point gap at the top of the table. Russia are top of Group B after they beat Macedonia 1-0 -- Igor Semshov's goal in the 41st minute separating the teams. The Republic of Ireland drew 0-0 with Slovakia in Dublin as both teams missed out on going top of the table. Armenia kept their slim hopes of qualification alive with a 3-0 win over Andorra. In Group C, Italy could only manage a 1-0 win away to the Faroe Islands but still extended their lead over Slovenia, who lost 2-1 at home to Estonia. Serbia boosted their chances of qualifying for next year's championships with a 1-0 win over Northern Ireland in Belfast -- Marko Pantelic's 67th minute goal lifting them to third in the table. Two early goals from Karim Benzema and Yann M'Vila set up a 2-1 victory for France against Albania in Group D. The win leaves them three points ahead of Bosnia and Herzegovina who leapfrogged Belarus on Friday after they defeated them 2-0 in Minsk. In the other Group D match, Romania kept in touch with the qualifying places with a 2-0 win over Luxembourg. In Group F, Greece are top after a 1-0 over Israel in Tel Aviv, while Croatia remain a point behind them after a 3-1 win over Malta. In the bottom half of the table, Latvia beat Georgia 1-0 in Tbilisi. Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Portugal stayed top of Group H on goal difference with a 4-0 away victory against Cyprus.

"(CNN) -- In January 2010, a hardcore ""Transformers"" fan going by ""gaastra"" on a message board for Shout! Factory (a DVD and CD company ""for the discerning pop culture geek"") asked the simple question, ""What would it take to get the Takara shows a release in America?"" Before long, Shout! Factory DVD producer Brian Ward was asking fans how much interest they would have in such a release and what they would like to see on it. 18 months later, the first of the ""Takara shows,"" known as ""Transformers: Headmasters,"" was officially released Tuesday for the first time in the United States. Such is the relationship that geek-friendly companies like Shout! have with fans that this release has seen the light of day. ""I'm really excited about it,"" said Michael Albert of Bear, Delaware, moderator of Seibertron.com, a ""Transformers"" community site that boasts as many as 300,000 page views per day (mostly by fans whose interest in ""Robots in Disguise"" goes well beyond one of the biggest box office successes of the year, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" and its predecessors). ""This is the first time we've gotten a legitimate release of this Japanese series. You would have to get recordings of them burned onto DVDs, or import them from Australia or Europe, or find a laser-disc player from the 1980s to watch this."" Albert and others from Seibertron.com -- one of many fan sites like tfarchive.com, tformers.com and tfw2005.com -- said that these releases were one of the most sought-after items by fans over the years. The Transformers first became a pop cultural phenomenon in the U.S. in the mid-'80s, based on a pair of toy lines from Japan's Takara company, Microman and Diaclone. When interest in the characters faded after a very short-lived fourth season of the original ""G1"" animated series, it came full circle with the Japanese producing ""Headmasters,"" the first in a series of anime which took the characters in a wild new direction, involving new characters who were able to detach their heads, which were entirely separate characters (the U.S. series only touched on this concept briefly before it ended). ""It really is interesting to see just how the Japanese and their culture played into a series that for most of us we've only known as straightforward Autobots vs Decepticons,"" said Ward, a ""Transformers"" fan himself who has produced all of the Shout! Factory releases of other series, such as ""G1"" and the 1990s ""Transformers: Beast Wars."" ""[The Takara anime series] really bends towards a lot of things that Japanese children want to see,"" said Albert. ""After 'Headmasters' is over, the Transformers are not so much sentient robots but having human drivers. From what I understand, Japanese children prefer having human drivers."" Ward pointed out other, more subtle culture differences. ""Where the G1 characters would call Optimus Prime 'optimus' -- they were pretty casual with their leader -- the Japanese approach it very differently. Optimus Prime will be referred in more of a formal manner, he'll be 'Commander' or something among those lines."" ""The Autobots and Decepticons [in these series] are, no pun intended a well ordered machine,"" he said. ""It's interesting to watch those characters change culturally."" ""Some major characters die early on,"" said Matt Brown of Canton, Michigan, a podcaster at Seibertron.com. ""Later in the series, another major character bites the dust. They don't mess around."" As with any anime import, there is the eternal debate of ""subbed versus dubbed."" There are some fans who simply do not want to watch subtitles. Kim Manning, head programmer for Adult Swim (which is owned by Time Warner, also owner of CNN), and one of the top people responsible for what anime series are seen in the United States, said that every effort is made to get dubbed versions. ""I think they're more likely to reach a more mainstream audience, and we're always hoping to get a larger audience excited about anime,"" she said. ""I think hearing it in your native language allows you to get more absorbed in the action, and to pay more attention to the animation, which is often just gorgeous."" In the case of ""Headmasters"" however, the episodes are not dubbed, but have brand-new subtitles. ""We saw the releases that had come out in the U.K. and Australia and saw that the subtitles there weren't entirely accurate, and in some cases didn't make sense,"" said Ward. ""It was clear that the folks who had translated did not use English as their first language. We gave it to a really good captioning and subtitling house in L.A. and they did a brilliant job of accurately translating the dialogue and understanding what was being said. We got those scripts approved by Hasbro (owners of 'Transformers'), and we're really happy with the outcome. The translation is about as close as one can get to an accurate translation of what's being said in Japanese."" Dubbed versions of the series are out there, however, including one for Malaysian and Singapore television. ""When we heard them, it really got to a point where it was comical,"" Ward explaned. ""The voices were awful. Names would change. Soundwave disappears and is simply replaced by 'New Soundwave.' It was almost the equivalent of watching a Saturday afternoon martial arts movie dub, and that's certainly not something we wanted to do with a property as beloved as 'Transformers,' so we opted out of original dubs and went for brand new subtitles."" Early fan reaction to this was not entirely positive. ""There was a small bit of disappointment that the project couldn't secure enough funding to do a brand-new English dub,"" said Seibertron.com podcaster Bob King of Ashley, Pennsylvania. ""I kind of share that feeling, but I also know that this isn't going to be a very mainstream release, and for them to spend that much money would be kind of a gamble. I appreciate that they're staying cautious."" ""People who have not seen it before might be disappointed in the subtitles, but rest assured [that the existing dubs] are that horrible,"" said Seibertron.com founder Ryan Yzquierdo, from Chicago, Illinois. ""You can't actually sit there and watch the dubs, unless you like drinking while watching 'Transformers.'"" Albert said that the Takara series' legacy extends beyond a mere curiosity: ""The themes are non-Western compared to what Hasbro does now but some of the design aesthetics do play into what we see today."" The other Takara series will be released in the near future as ""The Japanese Collection,"" though a production delay has postponed its release for several weeks. Despite those delays and some early hesitation from the subtitle-phobic, Yzquierdo said that most fans are just excited to check the shows out: ""This is something that I never thought I would see released in the States."" Indeed, this is just the latest example of fans communicating directly with companies to make a difference in what material is released to the public. Manning has communicated often with a ""vibrant"" community of fans on the Adult Swim message boards. ""We definitely look at what people are talking about online, what people are watching and buying online, too. From that, we're always looking for shows that we think will appeal to our audience, and then we pass it around the office -- several of us are anime fans, as well, so we make our own focus group."" As for the importance of the release of ""Headmasters"" specifically, Ward said, ""It gives [fans] something definitive, something approved by Hasbro. Casual fans who just love Transformers will be really surprised by the quality of the show. These were things that were almost, for lack of a better word, lost to American audiences.""","Japan's ""Transformers: Headmasters"" released in U.S. for the first time .

"(CNN) -- A notorious Bosnian Serb general accused of trying to eliminate Bosnian Muslims and Croats from their shared country could face two separate trials in the United Nations' International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Prosecutors want to try Ratko Mladic first for his alleged crimes in Srebrenica, Bosnia, in 1995, according to a statement from the tribunal Tuesday. Then, prosecutors want to try him for allegedly spreading terror throughout the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo from 1992 to 1995, and for taking U.N. personnel hostage, the statement says. In both cases, Mladic faces charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of the laws and customs of war, the statement says. Prosecutors say dividing the case against Mladic ""will maximize the prospect of justice for the victims, enable more effective management of the two separate trials and best allow the proceedings to be adapted in case of unforeseen contingencies."" In addition, prosecutors say they're taking into account ""Mladic's arrest at this late stage of the Tribunal's mandate, the need to ensure justice for the victims, the desirability of commencing a trial as soon as possible, and the need to plan for the contingency that Mladic's health could deteriorate.""

When Yugoslavia dissolved in the early 1990s, Mladic led Bosnia Serb forces in the civil war that broke out in the part of Yugoslavia that became Bosnia-Herzegovina.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fugitive Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's compound was strewn with shell casings and litter two days after its capture by rebel forces, while the bodies of a dozen bound men lay in a nearby intersection. The sprawling complex was littered with spent anti-aircraft shells, with rebel fighters picking through the detritus of the life Gadhafi's supporters left behind when they fled. An armored BMW sedan sat abandoned in a garage near the ""House of Resistance,"" the bombed-out building that Gadhafi left unrepaired as a monument to a 1986 U.S. airstrike that killed one of his daughters. Several NATO airstrikes and the onslaught that led to the fall of the Bab al-Aziziya compound on Tuesday inflicted more damage on the site, the symbolic heart of Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule. But during a visit by CNN to part of the compound on Thursday, there was no sign of the network of tunnels and bunkers long believed to have been built beneath Gadhafi's headquarters. Nor was there any sign of Gadhafi or his sons, the subjects of an intense manhunt since their regime crumbled. The streets outside Bab al-Aziziya are awash in guns and rumors, including one that saw rebel fighters surround a nearby apartment complex Thursday on a tip that Gadhafi was inside. He was not found. The National Transitional Council, the rebel leadership, says it is determined to flush him out with minimal civilian losses. ""We don't want to spill a lot of blood, you know, because they are our brothers,"" one rebel fighter said. At a nearby intersection, a dozen bodies lay in the sun, some of them with their hands bound. Rebel fighters say the men were executed by Gadhafi's retreating forces. But the bodies appear to be those of black Africans, who made up a large portion of the pro-Gadhafi forces, raising questions about whether the men may have been executed by the rebels. To the south of the compound, which is located near Tripoli's Mediterranean shore, fighting between rebel fighters and Gadhafi loyalists persisted. Snipers and mortar shells continued to inflict casualties on hundreds of civilians, said Kirstie Campbell, a worker for the International Medical Corps in Tripoli. ""I've worked in war zones for 10 years, but this is pretty bad,"" she said. CNN's Dan Rivers and Thomas Evans contributed to this report.","Moammar Gadhafi's captured compound is littered with spent shells and debris .

"(CNN) -- The wife of a man killed by a shark during their honeymoon in the Seychelles islands paid tribute to him Wednesday, calling him a devoted husband and ""best friend."" Ian Redmond of Britain died after he was attacked by a shark Tuesday off Anse Lazio beach on the island of Praslin, authorities said. ""I loved him so much and he was a very special husband, a thoughtful son and a devoted brother. He worked tirelessly to give us both a wonderful married life and home and I want to thank him for nine years of joy,"" his wife, Gemma Redmond, said. ""We were having so much fun and we were so excited about our future together. Myself, our families and our friends are devastated and shocked by what has happened. The loss of Ian has left a gaping hole in our hearts that will never be filled. ""He was always calm and collected, strong and brave, witty and intelligent, handsome and caring, a remarkable individual who will be deeply and sorely missed. We are privileged and proud to have shared our lives with him,"" she added. The British high commissioner and a consular official have traveled to the island off the east coast of Africa, the U.K. Foreign Office said. ""Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time,"" the Foreign Office said. Authorities in the Seychelles, an Indian Ocean archipelago, have issued a temporary ban on entering the water in five areas following two fatal shark attacks this month -- the one on Redmond and another two weeks ago. French newspaper Le Figaro reported that a 36-year-old French man was badly bitten on the legs and died as he dived off the same beach in early August. An autopsy concluded he was the victim of a shark attack, the paper said.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Russian officials say a terrorist explosion is the most likely cause of the derailment of an express train which killed at least 26 people and injured dozens more. The head of the Russian Railroads company  Vladimir Yakunin told state TV Saturday that investigators' ""main theory behind the accident is the blast of an unidentified explosive device conducted by unidentified persons -- simply speaking, a terrorist act."" State TV also quoted survivors who said they heard a blast moments before the train derailed. The Russian prosecutor's office is investigating whether the crash was caused by a terrorist attack, spokeswoman Marina Gridneva said. Police said they found a small crater beneath the tracks. But authorities were also looking into the possibility there was a technical fault on the track. Health Minister Tatyana Golikova said 96 people were injured, while the Russian prosecutor's office said 102 were hurt. Forty of the injured were in critical condition, Golikova said. Eighteen people were still listed as missing after the Friday night crash, said Sergei Shoigu, the Russian minister for emergency situations. A total of 681 people -- 20 of them employees -- were on the Nevsky Express as it traveled from Moscow to St. Petersburg on Friday night. The Nevsky Express is Russia's fastest train, equivalent to a bullet train. The crash happened at 9:25 p.m. (1825 GMT) when the train was 280 kilometers (174 miles) from St. Petersburg, Russian state radio said. At least three carriages carrying more than 130 people derailed and turned on their sides, and emergency workers were working to free anyone who may still be trapped inside. The crash happened 44 minutes after another high-speed train, the Sapsan, had successfully traveled from Moscow to St. Petersburg on the same rails, a representative of the Russian Transport Police said during a video conference call Saturday. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Shoigu of the emergency situations ministry also took part in the call. Shoigu said he would get more information as the derailed cars are lifted and authorities can see what is underneath. In August 2007, an explosion on the tracks derailed the Nevsky Express, injuring 60 people in what authorities called a terrorist act. Some 27,000 passengers on 60 trains were facing delays Saturday as a result of the accident, Russian State TV reported.

"Beijing (CNN)  -- Yao Ming fans in China reacted with shock and disbelief when they learned from U.S. media reports Friday night that their basketball idol has decided to retire. Fans took to the Internet Friday to express their feelings about the basketball star, who plays with the Houston Rockets in the NBA. ""I did not expect his retirement to come so soon!"" said a Netizen called Yilubaijiahei in a Sina Weibo microblog. What does retirement mean for fans? Another person who went by the name Tuzitouda in another tweet wrote: ""I feel a little bit of sadness. If Big Yao retires, it is not only the end of an era, but also the end of my NBA-syndrome including those seasons when Yao played with the Rockets."" Major news portals in China put the news on their front pages. ""The U.S. media say Yao has formally decided to retire, Chinese superstar says goodbye to NBA,"" reads the headline of Tencent Sports. But Sina Sports, a section of Sina. com, one of China's biggest web portals, says its reporter reached Zhang Mingji soon after hearing the media reports. Zhang, who is one of Yao's agents, said Yao did not announce his retirement and did not inform the NBA and the Houston Rockets that he was doing so, as reported by the U.S. media. Yao's agent told CNN that he is giving a news conference in Shanghai on July 20 to talk about ""his future career plans."" Chinese sports writers and fans believe that Yao's retirement, of course, will happen sooner or later, although they hope it will be later. They hope the superstar could still play not only in the NBA but for the Chinese national team in the London Olympics next year. The Shanghai native, who stands at 7-feet, 6-inches, was the NBA's top overall draft in 2002, when he was signed by Houston Rockets. He is one of the most successful overseas players in the league. Voted an All-Star player eight times, Yao has chalked up a career average of 19 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks. His field-goal percentage was 52.4. In recent years, however, he struggled with foot and ankle injuries. He missed the 2009-2010 season. After playing only five games, he missed that last season, when he suffered a stress fracture on his left ankle. Yao has been undergoing treatment and training in recent months, but doubts about whether he could make a comeback persists. When asked about his future prospects, Yao himself was reticent. In an interview with a CCTV sportscaster last month, Yao said: ""I don't know if I would join some champion team in the future. I don't even know if I can play again."" Yao revealed that his left ankle injury was far from healed. ""Walking or jogging is okay... but I need to get 80 percent of my strength back to play. I have got only 30 percent at most now."" Last month, Yao brought his one-year-old daughter Amy to China for the first time since her birth in the United States. Yao said Amy is one incentive for him to return to the NBA. Yao told CCTV: ""I wish she could watch me play and even win a championship, not only see through video highlights how her dad played before. She is definitely a big motivation for me to continue my role as a player, although my foot still needs a lot of treatment to meet the demands of the game."" The 30-year-old Yao sounded mellow about this future in NBA. ""A championship ring has become not so important in my plans,"" he said in the interview. ""My main thought for the next 10 years is to look after my family and continue my community activities."" The basketball superstar has set up the Yao Ming Foundation which he uses to attract donations and raise funds for charity, including building schools and supporting education. He has also joined campaigns to curb environmental degradation and promote animal rights, including multi-media campaign to curb consumption of shark's fins, which are considered a gourmet delicacy in China and Asia. If Yao retires, he would leave behind giant footprints in world of basketball and business. He helped expand the popularity of sports globally and specially in China. Yao is the icon of China's basketball. He was the pillar of the national men's team for many years, playing in world championships and the Olympics. He is also China's goodwill ambassador, the most recognizable face of China overseas. Thanks to Yao, the NBA has been successful in China. NBA games are televised in many TV and cable channels through the season. NBA stars have a big following in the mainland. Some like Jason Kidd and Shane Battier, like Yao, make a lot of money here from endorsing basketball sneakers and sports apparels produced by local companies, like Li Ning and PEAK. Yao Ming currently endorses Chinese brands such as China Unicom CDMA and China Life Insurance, as well as global brands such as Pepsi, Gatorade sports drinks, Visa, McDonald's and Apple computers.","NEW: Yao's agent tells CNN he will hold news conference on July 20 to discuss his future .

"(CNN) -- The Tanzanian island of Zanzibar began three official days of mourning Sunday, a day after 200 people died when a ferry jammed with passengers and tons of cargo capsized amid strong waves. In addition to Tanzania, South Africa was sending divers and navy forces to help with recovery efforts, said Mohamed Aboud, the state minister of Zanzibar. British officials have also sent helicopters to help with the search efforts. ""Right now, we are focusing on getting the bodies for the relatives, but you never know, God is God ... we might find people alive,"" he said. Rescuers saved 579 people, including 20 children, Aboud said. ""A lot of children are going back to Zanzibar for school, so there were a lot on the ferry,"" said Ismail Katumba, a resident of Dar es Salaam. ""It was so chaotic. It was so crowded."" The minister said the ferry carries a maximum capacity of about 600 people and was traveling between the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. But additional passengers, who were apparently not registered, had also made their way onboard, he said. It capsized in predawn hours local time, sending passengers scrambling for any available objects to avoid getting swallowed by the dark waves, witnesses said. Some jumped atop mattresses floating from the cargo. Fisherman, local hotels and residents joined rescue crews to help in the search, authorities said. Rescue crews took bodies to a nearby tent. ""You could hear people screaming loud and crying as bodies surfaced, mostly children,"" said Katumba, who lost a friend in the accident. ""What you do is you just go over and start looking at the bodies to identify them."" Most of the rescued were transported to local hospitals for treatment, and some have been discharged. President Ali Mohamed Shein of Zanzibar, who ordered the three days of mourning, also called for flags to fly at half staff. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete also said the nation would mark three days of mourning starting Sunday. The government has buried dozens of unidentified victims, the minister said, and will maintain records for those searching for loved ones. Pemba and Zanzibar, the two main islands on the Zanzibar archipelago, are popular among tourists for their pristine sandy beaches on the Indian Ocean. Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania.

"(CNN) -- Gunmen shot dead Argentine folk singer Facundo Cabral on Saturday as his car made its way to the airport in Guatemala City, police said. A motive for the killing of one of Latin America's best-known folk singers remained unclear. The singer's agent was also shot and is in stable condition in the hospital, said police spokesman Donald Gonzalez. In Guatemala on a Latin American tour, Cabral, 74, left his hotel at 5:40 a.m. in a white SUV for an eight-minute ride to the airport. Gunmen attacked the SUV -- at least 20 bullet holes could be seen on the Range Rover. Nothing was reported stolen from the vehicle, government spokesman Ronaldo Robles said. Police found a brown Hyundai Santa Fe nearby containing bullet-proof vests and AK-47 magazines. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom declared three days of national mourning. His government said an investigation has been launched but, at this point, that it was too early to say whether Cabral was the victim of a robbery or a direct attack. ""As a country, we are saddened by the cowardly attack against those who will live on in memory -- singing about life, happiness and love,"" the government said in a statement. Guatemalan Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu traveled to the site of the attack, where she wept and said the singer had died ""for his ideals,"" according to Notimex, the state-run news agency in Mexico. ""I can't think of a single reason why Cabral was killed here in Guatemala. He came just to sing,"" Notimex reported she said. Cabral was the latest victim in a wave of violence that has rocked Guatemala ahead of elections. In a report last month, the International Crisis Group warned that the violence and unregulated campaign finance were putting the country's political institutions at risk. Stephen McFarland, the U.S. ambassador to Guatemala, echoed that warning Saturday. ""I think this of course hurts Guatemala's image before the rest of the region and I believe that brings serious questions to the table about what can be done to prevent this from continuing,"" he said. Guatemala's human rights ombudsman, Sergio Morales, expressed his condolences to Argentina. ""I ask authorities of this country that this crime not be left unsolved, to investigate,"" he said. Ironically, Cabral, who said he was inspired by Jesus Christ and Mohandas Gandhi, was recognized in 1996 by the Organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as a ""World Peace Messenger."" iReporter recounts meeting the singer under strange coincidences . Cabral gained fame as a protest singer. His song, ""No Soy De Aqui, Ni Soy De Alla"" (""I'm Not From Here Nor There"") was recorded in nine languages by stars including Julio Iglesias and Neil Diamond.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Water with trace amounts of radioactivity may have leaked for months from a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine as it traveled around the Pacific to ports in Guam, Japan and Hawaii, Navy officials told CNN on Friday. The USS Houston arrives in Pearl Harbor for routine maintenance, during which the leak was found. The leak was found on the USS Houston, a Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine, after it went to Hawaii for routine maintenance last month, Navy officials said. Navy officials said the amount of radiation leaked into the water was virtually undetectable. But the Navy alerted the Japanese government because the submarine had been docked in Japan. The problem was discovered last month when a build-up of leaking water popped a covered valve and poured onto a sailor's leg while the submarine was in dry dock. An investigation found a valve was slowly dripping water from the sub's nuclear power plant. The water had not been in direct contact with the nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. Officials with knowledge of the incident could not quantify the amount of radiation leaked but insisted it was ""negligible"" and an ""extremely low level."" The total amount leaked while the sub was in port in Guam, Japan and Hawaii was less than a half of a microcurie (0.0000005 curies), or less than what is found in a 50-pound bag of lawn and garden fertilizer, the officials said. The sailor who was doused, a Houston crew member, tested negative for radiation from the water, according to Navy officials. Since March, the Houston had crisscrossed the western Pacific, spending a week in Japan and several weeks in both Guam and Hawaii, Navy officials said.  See a timeline of the sub's movements » . The Navy on Friday notified the Japanese government of the leak, the officials said, and told them it was possible the ship had been leaking while in port in Sasebo, Japan, in March. While Japan has agreed to allow U.S. nuclear-powered ships in Japanese ports, the decision was a not popular in Japan. The Houston incident comes at a time when the Navy is trying to smooth over a problem with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The USS George Washington was due to replace the aging, conventionally powered USS Kitty Hawk this summer as the United States' sole carrier based in Japan. While en route to Japan this May, a massive fire broke out on the George Washington, causing $70 million in damage. The fire was blamed on crew members smoking near improperly stored flammable materials. There was no damage or threat to the nuclear reactor, but the ship was diverted to San Diego, California, for repairs. It now is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of September. The Navy this week fired the captain and his deputy, saying an investigation into the fire led to a lack of confidence in the leadership of both men. Just two weeks ago, thousands of Japanese protested the pending arrival of the George Washington.","Leak was found on the USS Houston during routine maintenance last month .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Dozens of civilians may have been killed by Yemeni forces since May while fighting an armed Islamist group in Abyan province, the activist group Human Rights Watch said in a report released Saturday. But a spokesman for Yemen's ruling party disputed the findings. ""As Yemeni government forces battle armed militants in Abyan, civilians are paying the price,"" Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in the report. ""Both sides need to be doing much more to protect civilians from harm, and the government should be investigating possible laws-of-war violations by its forces in Abyan."" Human Rights Watch said it did not visit Abyan province because of security concerns but received accounts of attacks from 30 witnesses who fled the clashes. The group cited several reported incidents, including what some described as indiscriminate attacks on civilians with ""artillery shrapnel or small arms with no visible fighting or military targets nearby."" But the ruling party in Yemen refuted the report. ""The Yemeni government insists that the Human Rights Watch report is 100(%) inaccurate,"" said Tareq Shami, spokesman for the ruling General People's Congress party. ""Only al Qaeda targets are killed by the government, and there is no proof of the government being involved in the killing of civilians in Abyan."" He added, ""Foreign fighters are also involved killing and attacking civilians in Abyan, not the government. We are defending the people and will continue doing so."" Abdu Ganadi, spokesman for the Yemeni government, said ""all wars have casualties."" ""Yemen is trying to limit the civilian deaths,"" Ganadi said. ""Our condolence(s) to the families who lost a loved one."" Yemen has been consumed by unrest for months as protesters have demanded an end to the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule. Saleh and other senior officials were wounded June 3 in an attack on the mosque at the presidential palace. Saleh is being treated in Saudi Arabia. Officials have said he will return when he has recovered. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

"New York (CNN) -- Despite exceptional security ahead of the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, many New Yorkers said they remain undaunted about the potential terror threat. While most were aware of the possibility of danger this weekend, many said they won't allow it to spoil the commemoration of those who lost their lives. ""I've lived in New York 40 years,"" said M. Lou Benard, who works for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as an event planner and lives on the Upper West Side. ""I'm not nervous. I don't believe the fear propaganda."" ""I won't let them win,"" Benard added. ""Right after (the attacks) I was nervous, but now I can't let them win."" Ten years ago Sunday, she was on her way to work in Midtown Manhattan. Benard came out of the Chambers Street subway entrance 10 minutes after the plane hit the North Tower at the World Trade Center. ""I came out and saw the first tower on fire,"" she said. ""I was in such a state of shock, I thought, who would do that?"" Though she says the sight of police wielding automatic weapons makes her nervous, she's glad they're there. ""It's good they are vigilant,"" Benard said. ""While I was running away, those guys were running toward it."" Lt. Michael Killeen of the New York City Fire Department's Engine Company 23 on W. 58th Street  will never forget September 11. The engine company lost six men that day. Killeen takes the threats seriously -- ""you'd be a fool if you didn't"" -- but said that he and his fellow firefighters are in good spirits. They will hold a memorial Sunday at the firehouse. Across town in Queens, Shawn Foley -- a 33 year-old attorney who works in Manhattan -- says the terrorist threat has not changed his plans for the weekend. ""There's so much, not just authorities, but regular people who are aware of (the recent terror threats)."" Bill Parker, a researcher for a biotech research company who lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side, agrees that diligence on the part of authorities make him feel safe. ""I'm relieved because of the Times Square Bomber,"" said Parker, referring to the foiled car bombing of Times Square in 2010. The attack was thwarted when two street vendors noticed the bomb, and alerted an police officer. While many talked about memorial events, others said they want to go about business as usual. Miniature replicas of the Statue of Liberty and novelty coffee mugs adorn shelves and I (heart) New York T-shirts hang on racks at a souvenir shop on 7th Avenue in Manhattan. Employee Farhana Mohammad, who works there, said she's seen more tourists than usual over the weekend. ""I think people want to show respect to the memorial,"" she said, ""They're not scared, they just want to show support, and I'm not scared either."" Rita Silverman, who lives on the Upper West Side, refuses to let the threat of another terror attack scare her. ""I'm sanguine,"" she said. ""If something is going to happen it's going to happen. I'd rather not spend my time being tense. ""I live in New York."" Those in The Big Apple are contending with random police checkpoints that caused major traffic delays and commuter headaches, but Silverman thinks the measures are worth it. ""It's annoying in the sense that it slows you down, but for safety, the pleasures of New York outweigh any discomforts or delays,"" she said. But Erfanu Hoque, a taxi driver from Queens, said the security measures have hurt his business. ""I don't make money because I'm stuck in traffic,"" he said, sitting at a traffic light in Manhattan's Columbus Circle. But ""I'm not nervous about this weekend because of the security. Anything (that is) for security ... that's okay."" At another light at Columbus Circle, police randomly selected cars out of traffic for searches. Authorities inspected the trunk of the car of Yelena Weinstein, a Brooklyn resident and Manhattan high school teacher. Just after police waived her on from the checkpoint, she said, ""I felt scared when it happened, but it's okay. Let them search me."" Tim and Marianne Yoder, Midtown Manhattan residents, say they appreciated the security. ""I hope people cooperate,"" said Tim Yoder. His wife said she is not ""nervous about this threat, we're just proud to be Americans, and moved by the anniversary. ""It's amazing to see the police and firemen doing their jobs, just like they did that day (10 years ago),"" she said. As Ken Bronstein, a retired businessman from the Upper East Side, reflected on the past 10 years, he said the security precautions were necessary. ""If I were the mayor I'd do the same thing, even if there wasn't a threat."" Bronstein was going to the World Trade Center on 9/11 but was held up waiting for a new refrigerator to be delivered to his apartment.

A somber Paul Simon, wearing a 9/11 Memorial cap, performed ""The Sound of Silence,"" a change from ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" listed on the program. People in the crowd cried, embraced or sang along. Others milled around the water memorials at the World Trade Center's towers. Many did paper rubbings of victims' names or left flowers. Sixty bagpipers and drummers led a processional at the beginning of the ceremony. The Brooklyn Youth Chorus sang ""The Nation Anthem"" and cellist Yo-Yo performed a Bach selection. In America, thoughts turn to 10 years ago . As is customary, people who lost relatives that day read their names aloud. Linda Spinella, 52, of Wayne, New Jersey, talked about her brother Mark Zangrilli, 36, who worked in the South Tower. ""Too many people lost too many people,"" said Spinella. Her brother's name was one of the last to be read. By then, many people had left the memorial service. ""He had a really contagious laugh,"" Spinella said.

"London (CNN) -- Four top British police officers will not face further police investigation in connection with an inquiry into phone hacking by journalists, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said Wednesday. They are former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson, former Assistant Commissioners John Yates and Andy Hayman and former Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke. Stephenson resigned as head of London's Metropolitan Police, also known as Scotland Yard, after it was revealed that Scotland Yard had hired a former top News of the World journalist to be a communications consultant. The revelation came the same day police arrested the journalist, Neil Wallis, over the phone-hacking investigation. Stephenson insisted he had done nothing wrong. All four officers were referred to the IPCC by the local police authority after their involvement in the phone-hacking scandal engulfing News of the World and its parent company, News International, came under scrutiny. News of the World was shut down last month amid allegations its staff had hacked the voice mail of people ranging from celebrities to crime victims, and bribed police. Top Metropolitan Police officers were accused of being too cozy with senior News International staff. The IPCC said in a statement that ""in relation to their alleged respective roles in the 'phone hacking' investigation, the conduct of none of these officers amounts to recordable conduct."" IPCC Deputy Chair Deborah Glass said the Metropolitan Police had ""rightly come under huge scrutiny"" over its role in responding to allegations of phone hacking by News of the World, Britain's best-selling Sunday paper. ""There can be no doubt about the damaging effect of the perceived inadequate response -- in particular, the failure to notify its many apparent victims -- on public confidence. Sir Paul Stephenson and John Yates both acknowledged this in their decisions to resign,"" she said. But, she added, a ""clear line must be drawn between what is a recordable conduct matter -- in effect, conduct that is either criminal or for which an officer should be disciplined -- and public concerns that will be addressed and scrutinized by Lord Justice Leveson's public inquiry."" The Leveson inquiry was set up by Prime Minister David Cameron to look into the conduct of the UK media and allegations of phone hacking and police corruption. Stephenson said the outcome of the IPCC probe ""is as I would have expected it to be. ""I regret resources have had to be expended on this matter,"" he said in a statement. Yates handed in his resignation the day after Stephenson quit. He was the officer who decided in 2009 that there was no need to open a new police investigation into phone hacking, despite the 11,000 pages of evidence sitting at Scotland Yard -- a decision he later admitted to Parliament was ""crap."" The IPCC said it ""would agree that he made a poor decision in 2009"" but said it saw no purpose in questioning him about it again. However, Yates faces further investigation over his alleged role in securing a police job for Wallis' daughter, the IPCC said. Yates said he was pleased he would not be scrutinized further over phone hacking but ""disappointed"" he still faced questions over what he called his ""peripheral involvement"" in the employment of Wallis' daughter. ""I strongly deny any wrongdoing and I am completely confident that I will be exonerated,"" he said in a statement. Cameron has faced questions over his judgment in hiring former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as his communications adviser after he resigned from the newspaper. Coulson says he was not aware of wrongdoing while he edited the paper. In a statement released Wednesday by the prime minister's Downing Street office, Cameron said: ""Clearly if I had known then all the things I know now, then obviously I would have taken different decisions."" The IPCC's decision comes a day after a parliamentary committee examining the phone-hacking allegations at News of the World released dozens of documents related to its inquiry, reigniting questions over whether News International had tried to cover up what happened. Among the documents was a 2007 letter from the paper's former royal correspondent Clive Goodman -- who was sacked and jailed over intercepting royal voice mail -- to News International executives, in which he says that phone hacking was ""widely discussed"" at the newspaper until explicit reference to it was ""banned by the Editor."" The editor at the time was Coulson. A number of senior News International figures have been asked to give evidence to Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee in September. Coulson and others have also been sent letters asking if they wish to add to or amend their previous testimony before the panel.

"New Brunswick, New Jersey (CNN) -- I was 14 on September 11, 2001, and I was a freshman at Marlboro High School in Monmouth County, New Jersey. I experienced a lot of anxiety following the attacks. Terrorism was not a new concept to me. Being Jewish, I always had an interest in Israel, and even as a child, I was well aware of the threat and potential for hatred to manifest in malicious action. I became obsessed with the news coverage. Any time I was near a television, I would tune to CNN. I spent more time with Wolf Blitzer than with my parents. And looking back, this behavior was probably not the best for a 14-year-old, or for anyone, but I couldn't help it. I was mesmerized by the raw footage and intrigued by the uncertainty of our nation. It was exciting to be a part of the nationalism that characterized America after the attacks, but I was disheartened by its fleeting existence. The anxiety and fear that I experienced on and after the attacks on September 11 came rushing back the instant I heard of Osama bin Laden's death. Unlike the crowds of people who were seen celebrating in the streets in Washington and at ground zero in Lower Manhattan, I was scared the same way I was on September 11. It was the first time that I felt scared again. I did not feel safer because he was dead. I was, and still am, fearful of what the reaction will be from his followers. I recalled the images of our retaliation on television: how I couldn't discern any specific details, just the glowing green colors from night vision lenses, but knowing that I got what I wanted, what seemed like everyone wanted: revenge. Now, nearly 10 years later, we were told on Sunday night that we had brought bin Laden, the man responsible for the horrific attacks on September 11, to justice. But while listening to President Obama's speech, I thought to myself that this is not justice. There will never be justice. Bin Laden already accomplished what he wanted. As Americans watched the towers crumble on September 11, we realized that America is not an impenetrable force, and our lives would never be the same because of it. Killing bin Laden does not take that away. His actions were founded upon a deep-rooted hatred, a hatred that is shared by many others, whether he is dead or alive. Even the end of his life alone brings fear. The truth is, it will never end. That is the goal of terrorism. I took this class because I felt I needed to. I wanted to use the skills I acquired as a journalism student to tell a side of the September 11 story that has been untapped. I liked the angle of hearing the accounts from children who lost a parent on September 11 and how their lives have been altered because of it. I am slightly older than the other students in the class, and I felt that my experiences on September 11 were less sheltered. I also wanted to take the class because 14 victims were from my hometown -- Marlboro, New Jersey -- and I felt that it was important for it to be represented in the September 11 narrative. There are children who live literally down the street from me, who grew up alongside me, who I didn't even know who were affected by the tragedy. My interview subject, Corbin Mayo, is from Marlboro, and his father was a fire safety director (contracted for the New York/New Jersey Port Authority) for the World Trade Center. I was impressed by Corbin's willingness to speak about his experiences. As journalists, we distance ourselves from our subjects to avoid biases and to maintain objectiveness, but the focus of our class is centered on narrative journalism, which allows the reporter to establish a closer relationship with the people we interview. The stories we are compiling are not the quintessential accounts of September 11, depicting where they were when it happened, etc. These are the stories of their lives now.","Lilonsky interviewed Corbin Mayo for her 9/11 project .

"(CNN) -- Canada is formally completing its fighting mission in Afghanistan this week, a move that marks the end of a robust combat presence centered in the dangerous and violent southern province of Kandahar. The Canadian military on Tuesday formally transferred its last district in the province to the United States, where the U.S. 3rd Battalion 21st Regiment took over from the Canadian 1st Battalion, Royal 22nd Regiment. On Thursday, Canadian Brig. Gen. Dean Milner will transfer command of NATO-led troops in Kandahar's Panjwai and Dand districts to U.S. command. This transition comes as other countries make preparations for drawdowns and shifting to plans for non-combat missions in Afghanistan, such as training. U.S. President Barack Obama recently announced the withdrawal of 33,000 American troops by the end of next year. France announced that it would also begin to reduce troop numbers, saying it ""will initiate a progressive withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan, and will follow a timetable comparable to the withdrawal of the American troops."" One of more than 40 countries participating in NATO's International Security Assistance Force with nearly 3,000 troops, Canada has lost more than 157 troops in the war, the third highest death toll after the United States and Britain. The grinding conflict has been frustrating for many Canadian citizens, frustrated by the mission's casualties. Prime Minister Stephen Harper planned an end to the combat mission three years ago. Also, the government says, the ""incremental cost of the current mission in Afghanistan to the Government of Canada from 2001 to 2011 is currently estimated to be approximately $11.3 billion."" ""Through their operations there to cut off terror at its root, our men and women in uniform have made an enormous contribution to Canadian security abroad,"" said Harper, in his reaction to the killing in May of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. A transition unit of about 1,500 soldiers will be ""packing and shipping all of our equipment, materiel and vehicles back to Canada"" in the coming months, said Capt. Jennifer Stadnyk, spokeswoman at the Canadian Expeditionary Force Command in Ottawa, the Canadian capital. The plan is to have everything out and these troops home before Christmas,  she said. In the future, training of Afghan security will be the focus. Up to 950 Canadian armed forces trainers and support personnel eventually will be based in Kabul until 2014. The Canadians will be working alongside Americans, Brits, Australians and others in a countrywide training mission, Stadnyk said. Also, the government said, 45 members of civilian police forces will help mentor the Ministry of Interior and the Afghan National Police. ""What's interesting about this is the direction we kind of laid out in 2008 is actually now where NATO as a whole has gone, and everybody now is increasingly moving towards 2014, to moving towards training missions, giving the Afghans greater responsibility for their own security,"" Harper said in an interview with Canada's National Post newspaper last month. ""We will remain engaged on development and on diplomacy and on particular humanitarian issues, particularly the rights of women and children, education, these kinds of priorities. But we are looking for a military role to be a training role, a behind-the-wire role, and to make the Afghans responsible for their own country, and that's where it's headed.""","Canada lost 157 troops in Afghanistan .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's Rahul Gandhi warned lawmakers Friday not to allow the nation's democracy to be undermined, in an apparent criticism of anti-corruption campaigner Anna Hazare's high-profile hunger strike. His remarks came after Hazare's public fast entered its 11th day, as the 74-year-old activist presses for the creation of a powerful Lokpal, or citizen ombudsman, to tackle corruption. ""Individuals have brought our country great gains. They have galvanized people in the cause of freedom and development. However, we must not weaken the democratic process,"" Gandhi, who is tipped by Indian media as a future prime minister, told parliament in a speech. He thanked Hazare for articulating what he called larger public disillusionment with a system plagued by massive corruption. But in his address to the national assembly, the 40-year-old general secretary of India's governing Congress party cautioned against pressuring elected institutions. ""This (democratic) process is often lengthy and lumbering. But it is so in order to be inclusive and fair. It provides a representative and transparent platform where ideas are translated into laws,"" said Gandhi, whose Italian-born mother Sonia heads the Congress party. ""A process divorced from the machinery of an elected government, or this house, that seeks to undo the checks and balances created to protect the supremacy of parliament sets a dangerous precedent for a democracy,"" he told the lower chamber of elected lawmakers. Three of Gandhi's ancestors -- Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and his father Rajiv Gandhi -- have served as the country's prime minister in the past. Echoing current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's views that any institution alone cannot eradicate deeply-entrenched corruption, Gandhi described the proposed Lokpal as just one tool in the fight against graft. ""Witnessing the events of the last few days it would appear that the enactment of a single bill will usher in a corruption-free society. I have serious doubts about this belief,"" Gandhi said. ""An effective Lokpal law is only one element in the legal framework to combat corruption. The Lokpal institution alone cannot be a substitute for a comprehensive anti-corruption code. A set of effective laws is required,"" he added. Activists and the Indian government have been in talks for days, but there has been a deadlock primarily over three outstanding points to which campaigners want parliament and the government to agree. One of them relates to bringing Indian officials under the jurisdiction of the anti-corruption legislation.","India's Rahul Gandhi says a watchdog would not solve the problem of graft .

"(CNN) -- An Austrian man who allegedly held his daughter as a sex slave for 24 years has been charged with murdering one of their children, prosecutors say. Josef Fritzl is accused of fathering seven children by his daughter during her 24-year captivity. Austrian State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek told CNN Thursday that Josef Fritzl, 73, was charged with murder because one of the seven children died in infancy. The other six children survived. Fritzl, a retired electrician from Amstetten, 75 kilometers (46 miles) west of Vienna, was also charged with rape, incest, false imprisonment and slavery. The murder charge stems from the death of Fritzl's infant son, Michael Fritzl, who died from lack of medical care, the prosecutor said.  Watch as Fritzl is charged with murder » . ""Although he realized how life-threatening M.F.'s situation was after being born, Josef F. did not call out for help,"" Sedlacek said, explaining the charge. The trial is expected to begin early in 2009 and if convicted of murder Fritzl could face 10 to 20 years in prison. Austria, like other European countries, has no death penalty. Prosecutors say psychiatric tests show that Fritzl is mentally fit to stand trial but Sedlacek has asked that Fritzl be confined to a ""mental asylum."" Fritzl kept the daughter and all but three of the children in a cellar beneath his home in Amstetten, Austria, west of Vienna, officials say. Three of the children lived upstairs in the home Fritzl shared with his wife and several of their own children. Fritzl has been in custody since the case came to light in April, sparking worldwide attention. He had explained Elizabeth's disappearance in 1984 by saying the 18-year-old girl had run away from home, a story backed up by letters he forced Elisabeth to write, including one that begged her parents not to look for her. When Elizabeth gained her freedom, she told police her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. On August 8, 1984 -- weeks before she was reported missing -- her father enticed her into the basement, where he drugged her, put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room, she told police. For the next 24 years, she was constantly raped by her father, resulting in seven children, she said, according to the police statement. Fritzl's daughter and her children have since been receiving counseling although doctors warn that they will take years to recover. Members of the Fritzl family will also be offered the chance to adopt new identities in an effort to help them lead normal lives, officials said. Psychiatrist Max Friedrich, who treated the abducted Austrian teenager Natascha Kampusch, estimated it would take ""between five and eight years"" for the children to recover from their experiences.","Austrian man who allegedly held daughter for 24 years charged with murder .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration official in charge of operating the air traffic control system has resigned amid revelations that several controllers have fallen asleep on the job this year, the FAA chief said Thursday. Stepping down is Hank Krakowski, who has been the head of the FAA Air Traffic Organization. David Grizzle, the FAA's chief counsel, will be the acting chief of the unit during a search to fill the post, according to Randy Babbitt, the agency's administrator. ""Over the last few weeks we have seen examples of unprofessional conduct on the part of a few individuals that have rightly caused the traveling public to question our ability to ensure their safety. This conduct must stop immediately,"" Babbitt said in a written statement. ""I am committed to maintaining the highest level of public confidence and that begins with strong leadership,"" he said. The development came after another air traffic controller apparently fell asleep while on duty, the sixth such incident this year that the FAA has disclosed. The latest incident occurred Wednesday morning at Reno-Tahoe International Airport in Nevada ""when a controller fell asleep while a medical flight carrying an ill patient was trying to land,"" the FAA said. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood called the trend ""absolutely unacceptable"" and transportation officials immediately began making changes and reviews to address the problem. For example, Babbitt and LaHood said the FAA will assign an extra air traffic controller on the midnight shift at 27 control towers that have been staffed with only one controller during those hours. The FAA said Babbitt and National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Paul Rinaldi ""are launching a nationwide 'Call to Action' on air traffic control safety and professionalism"" and will visit air traffic facilities to underscore those points. The move will include ""an independent review of the FAA's air traffic control training curriculum and qualifications and the expansion of NATCA's Professional Standards committees."" The FAA is also reviewing staffing and scheduling. ""We are conducting a top-to-bottom review of the way we operate our air traffic control system,"" Babbitt said ""We are all responsible and accountable for safety -- from senior FAA leadership to the controller in the tower.  Employees at the FAA work diligently every day to run the safest air transportation system in the world. But I will continue to make whatever changes are necessary to ensure we concentrate on keeping the traveling public safe."" Along with the Nevada incident, cases of sleeping controllers occurred at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington and the McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville, Tennessee. Three incidents involving the same person occurred at Boeing Field/King County International Airport in Seattle. The FAA said it also suspended two controllers in Lubbock, Texas, for an incident in which they failed to hand off control of a departing flight to the Fort Worth Air Traffic Control Center, and responded only after several attempts by the same center to hand them control of an arriving flight. An FAA statement did not indicate whether the Lubbock controllers were thought to have been asleep. Krakowski's departure was seen as ironic by some, who said he worked hard to improve the safety culture of the FAA. Krakowski was the guiding force behind the FAA's Air Traffic Safety Action Program (ATSAP), which sought a nonpunitive environment to encourage FAA employees to report safety concerns.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods will follow his agent, Mark Steinberg, to Excel Sports Management, the company announced Monday. Steinberg joined Excel after more than a decade of working for sports agency IMG. ""After meeting with a number of agencies and businesses, I decided Excel was the perfect fit,"" Steinberg said in a prepared statement. The Golf Channel tweeted Sunday that the network would air a ""special announcement"" concerning Woods. Speculation swirled that the golfer would personally make a statement. The former world No. 1 had already announced that he will miss this week's British Open championship at Sandwich, England, because of injuries to his left leg. Woods, a three-time British Open winner, has not played since mid-May because of the problems. On his official website last week, Woods said: ""Unfortunately, I've been advised that I should not play in the British Open. ""As I stated at the AT&T National, I am only going to come back when I'm 100% ready as I do not want to risk further injury."" He continued: ""That's different for me, but I'm being smarter this time. I'm very disappointed and want to express my regrets to the British Open fans."" Woods suffered injuries to his left knee and left Achilles tendon during the Masters in April and withdrew after nine holes of the Players Championship when he inflamed his leg again. ""In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have competed at the Players but it's a big event, and I wanted to be there to support the PGA Tour,"" Woods added. ""I've got to learn from what I did there and do it right this time and not come back until I'm ready. ""I think my best years are still ahead of me, and I'm very confident and optimistic about the future,"" he said. The 35-year-old Woods, winner of the British Open in 2000, 2005 and 2006, also missed the 2008 tournament at Royal Birkdale following reconstructive knee surgery after his U.S. Open victory a month earlier.","NEW: Woods will follow his agent to Excel Sports Management .

"(CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Il arrived in China Thursday after a visit to Russia, the state-run Xinhua news agency in China reported. The brief report from Inner Mongolia said Kim was visiting northeastern China but gave no further details about what he was doing or who he was meeting. The trips comes after Kim visited Russia earlier this week, where he said North Korea is ready to return to nuclear talks without preconditions, according to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's spokeswoman. Medvedev and Kim talked for about two hours, Medvedev's spokeswoman Natalia Timakova told Russia's Interfax news agency. ""Kim Jong Il has expressed his readiness to resume the six-party (nuclear) talks without preconditions, and then during those talks (the North Koreans) will be ready to impose a ban on the production of nuclear materials and their testing,"" she said. The last round of six-party talks took place in 2008. In addition to Russia and North Korea, the talks also include South Korea, Japan, the United States and China. ""I have quite a positive feeling about the meeting, which was sincere, rich in content and multi-faceted,"" Medvedev said on Russian TV. While North Korea has called for the resumption of six-party talks without preconditions before, the United States and South Korea have insisted on a tangible demonstration from North Korea that it is serious about denuclearization. Washington and Seoul did not immediately respond to Wednesday's developments. It was first Kim's third visit to Russia. As on trips in 2001 and 2002, he travelled all the way from North Korea in his own armored train. RIA-Novosti said Kim's train consists of 17 rail cars, plus four Russian cars that were added in Russia's Far East to transport local Russian officials and extra security guards and service personnel.","Kim Jong Il arrives in northeastern China, according to a brief report .

"New York (CNN) -- Police will investigate the deaths of nearly 100 animals that were found in a Petco store after flooding in upstate New York, Johnson City Mayor Dennis Hannon said Monday. Employees at the Oakdale Plaza store checked on the premises late Wednesday and ""all was still well,"" Petco chief executive Jim Myers wrote Sunday on the chain's official blog, PetcoScoop. ""When the team members checked again early Thursday morning, the store was flooded with four feet of water and we were unable to enter,"" wrote Myers. A river flood warning was issued Wednesday afternoon for the entire Johnson City area, along with flash flood warnings that continued well into Thursday, according to Joanne Labounty, a spokeswoman for the National Weather Service. According to Hannon, a woman who identified herself as the manager of the store approached a firefighter who was near the Petco around 10:30 Thursday morning to request a boat. At that point, the store was under water, Hannon said, and there was not much the fire department could do. Once employees were able to re-enter the store, they were able to rescue a majority of the animals, Myers wrote. More than 100 small animals and three-quarters of the aquatic life were rescued, according to Lisa Epstein, a Petco spokeswoman. The small animals included an assortment of guinea pigs, mice, reptiles and birds. Hannon questioned how the animals could have survived, recalling that ""the floodwaters were very high, well above the front doors of the building. Unless the animals were very near the ceiling, a couple feet from it, they would have perished."" Hannon is upset that the store did not take more caution after he issued a state of emergency for Johnson City. ""The media was reporting that any area that was flooded in 2006 would be badly flooded again,"" Hannon told CNN, noting that the Oakdale Plaza was one of those areas. The Johnson City store is a relatively new location, Myers wrote in his blog, and it was not in operation during the record high-river floods of 2006, and ""we misjudged the risk to this location."" ""We apologize to the members of the Johnson City community and look forward to serving you better in the future,"" Myers wrote. Angry comments accompanied the blog post, with readers accusing the chain of making excuses. Several commenters said they had called PETA to report the incident. ""So many, so many residents are outraged over this, we owe it to the community to get to the bottom of it,"" Hannon said. Epstein said Petco is internally investigating the incident as well.","Flooding hit upstate New York last week .

"(CNN) -- Go ahead, read the headline again. It does say ""Writer's black"" and not ""Writer's block."" No doubt, overlooking a mistake like that would be a gigantic copy editing if not editorial blunder. But think about it. How often do we do the editorializing in our own minds before we even start to read a writer's work? A recent article by ESPN The Magazine writer Toure' about Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick got me to thinking. Opinion: Why I wrote 'If Michael Vick were white' The article and provocative headline pose the question, ""What if Michael Vick were white?"" ""Hmmm,"" I wondered out loud to another writer sitting next to me. ""Hmmm,"" the writer said back to me, following up with a ""That's deep."" Then we sat quietly for a few moments looking around the room, pondering. We didn't say much else, but the incident and the article stuck with me for a few days. ESPN defends 'white' Michael Vick . It stuck not because of the sports angle, but for the broader ramifications of his questions. It made me think about all the times I had to defend myself for something I said or wrote simply because of my gender, background and any other mechanism we use to define ourselves and other people. I thought about all the times I had been called privileged by African-Americans, biased by whites, narrow-minded by Hispanics, too sensitive by men and unfeeling by women, lefty by conservatives or right-wing by liberals. And I wondered what the response would have been if the reader knew nothing about my background or me. What would it be like? So I decided to write this article anonymously and provide you the reader with a sort of written Rorschach test. I could be white. I could be black. I could be Hispanic or Asian or male or female. Fill in the blanks. Straight away, I must admit that I have a completely selfish reason for doing this. The filter of my own experiences had duped me, too. In all honesty, when I saw Toure's byline, my mind immediately leaped to the finish, drawing a conclusion that an African-American writer would probably go easy on Vick. But I caught myself, stopped, and much like I do in both my personal and professional lives, I put the writer's ethnicity aside and kept reading. So, in an effort to make it easier for you to do the same, I'm removing my byline as I assess the racial and cultural differences that might have steered Michael Vick onto the path of dog fighting, his demise and eventual redemption. In one of the neighborhoods of my youth, blacks and whites had vastly different relationships with animals; mainly dogs. I'm generalizing here, but whites typically treated their dogs as part of their families. The dogs lived indoors, and they climbed onto sofas and into beds at will. But many blacks did not want to eat at a home where dogs or cats had the run of the house. The logic went: An animal in the house meant animal hair in the food. And by the same token, (again, a generalization) whites were generally upset by their black friends who treated their animals as not human. Dogs and cats were mostly kept outdoors unless the temperatures dipped below freezing or swelled to triple digits. Both black people and white people kept any chickens outdoors, and the only violence the fowl faced was getting their necks wrung on the way to becoming Sunday dinner. But for Hispanics I knew, cock fighting was not only accepted, but also expected. Those who partook didn't understand why it's OK to slaughter a rooster but it's not OK to have them fight. Spaniards celebrate bullfighting. Americans flock to the rodeo. And however you feel about any one of these probably has a lot to do with your relationship with animals growing up. Just as the ESPN article makes no excuses for Vick's behavior, this one doesn't either. Part of my mission is to help you understand that people from different backgrounds have different feelings about animals. And perhaps it has more to do with where you come from (culture) rather than the color of your skin. But in America, race somehow pervades the discussion on just about any subject. Even Toure' admits it in his own article when he questions the headline. He writes: ""This question makes me cringe. It is so facile, naive, shortsighted and flawed that it is meaningless. Whiteness comes with great advantages, but it's not a get-out-of-every-crime-free card. Killing dogs is a heinous crime that disgusts and frightens many Americans. I'm certain white privilege would not be enough to rescue a white NFL star caught killing dogs.""","ESPN article about a ""white"" Michael Vick got this author thinking .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran plans a ceremony to launch a controversial nuclear power plant Monday, the country's government-backed Press TV reported, making it the first nation in the Middle East to put a civilian nuclear power plant online. The Bushehr nuclear plant was connected to the national energy grid on September 3, the country's Atomic Energy Organization announced the following day. Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, said Sunday that Iran was committed to nuclear non-proliferation and international atomic energy standards, Press TV reported. Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko, whose country helped build Bushehr and who appeared with Salehi, said the plant was built to international standards and under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, according to Press TV. Days before the plant was connected to the grid, the IAEA cited increasing concerns that Iran may be developing nuclear weapons. The United Nations nuclear watchdog said in a report that Iran continues to defy U.N. resolutions aimed at curbing its nuclear program. Iran denies that it aims to build nuclear weapons. The Bushehr plant -- which is civilian, not military -- joined the national grid with a capacity of 60 megawatts, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said on its website September 4. The plant is expected to produce 1,000 megawatts of electricity when fully operational, about 2.5 percent of Iran's current electricity consumption, according to the IAEA. Iran began the Bushehr plant in 1975, before the revolution that created the current Islamic republic. The IAEA lists no other nuclear plants under construction in the region, though several other Middle Eastern countries have taken steps toward nuclear power. Journalist Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Bushehr is the first civilian nuclear power plant operating in the Middle East .

"New York (CNN) -- For the first time since the terror attack on the World Trade Center, the general public is being allowed back onto the site. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, members of the city council and some 9/11 victims' family members welcomed the first visitors to the 9/11 memorial plaza that opened on schedule Monday. ""The opening fulfills a promise we made to the families on the 10-year anniversary and keep it open for them and the rest of the world forever to reflect on what happened and to honor the 9/11 victims and heroes,"" said Bloomberg, who is also the 9/11 Memorial chairman. Families of victims were able to visit the memorial Sunday during ceremonies honoring those who were killed in the September 11, 2001, attacks that brought down the twin towers. ""We're so proud of this memorial,"" said Monica Iken, who lost her husband, Michael, in the attacks and was able to visit the memorial, along with other victims' families Sunday. ""I can go see Michael. He's home."" Monday's visitors passed through metal detectors and surveillance cameras as they began making their way to the the two huge, square fountains that mark the footprints of the World Trade Center towers. The fountains' water flows into granite reflecting pools at the center of the eight-acre, tree-lined plaza. Bronze plates surround the fountains and bear the names of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 2001 attacks, as well as the six who were killed when a terrorist truck bomb exploded in the parking garage beneath the towers in 1993. Some of the visitors were visibly emotional as they walked into the plaza Monday. Some rubbed their fingers across the etched names of those who died. One man took out a paper and stenciled over a name and carefully rolled up the paper to take with him. The names forming the perimeter where the North Tower stood are those who died in the building and the passengers on American Airlines Flight 11, which was crashed into it, as well as the six dead from the 1993 bombing. The South Tower site includes the names of dead who were in that building and United Flight 175, as well as the names of the first responders who were killed, the dead from the crash of American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon, and the dead of United Flight 93, which crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Anthoula Kastimades was there to greet visitors and spoke about seeing her own brother's name on the memorial. ""It was difficult ... obviously, if I could have it any other way his name would not be listed."" Kastimades brother, John, worked at Cantor Fitzgerald, on the 104th floor of the North Tower. His name is listed next to three or four people who worked at the same desk with him, day in and day out. By design, the placement of the names was given a lot of thought. Architect Michael Arad said the names are staggered, arranged not alphabetically but by something known as ""meaningful adjacency."" This way, Arad says, each name connects to another and ""beyond a physical place, there is a relationship between one name and another."" Input was shared by families of the victims so friends, family members, co-workers or people who commuted to work together were listed side by side. By doing so, more personal meaning was brought into the arrangement. Kastimades agrees. ""It gives me comfort that he's listed with them in peace."" She is also at peace with the memorial. Serving on the 9/11 Memorial board she worked tirelessly to get it right, especially for some 1,100 families, like hers, who have still not received loved ones' remains and consider the memorial to be sacred ground. ""I feel the souls of the victims here,"" Kastimades said, ""and I feel like John is here."" The memorial has created an authentic place of loss; Kastimades says that sets it apart from any other memorial. ""It's a wonderful feeling to know that we are with these beautiful souls."" While the memorial is sacred to loved ones, it also is very important for the country, said Joe Daniels, president of the 9/11 Memorial. ""I look forward to people coming here from around the world and sharing in this experience,"" he said. The memorial plaza will be open seven days a week, forever, Daniels said, though access will be restricted due to all the construction on other World Trade Center projects. Visitors must reserve a timed pass, which is free, through the memorial's website. More than 400,000 people from all 50 states and more than 70 countries have received passes at www.911memorial.org since the timed reservation system launched in July. Daniel said watching construction proceed on WTC 1, formerly known as the Freedom Tower, is part of the experience. ""The tallest building in the United States is being constructed right in front of them,"" he said, pointing at the structure that eventually will rise to 1,776 feet. Besides marking what happened here, Daniels said, the site reflects the nation's commercial response and strength of will. ""We can build bigger, build higher; that's the American way, and we're doing it."" The memorial's museum is still under construction and is expected to open September 11, 2012.

"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Arsenal have agreed a deal to sign Ivory Coast international striker Gervinho from French champions Lille for an undisclosed fee. Speaking at a press conference in Malaysia, where Arsenal have started a pre- season tour of the Far East, manager Arsene Wenger confirmed a deal for the 24-year-old had been agreed. A statement on the official Arsenal website also confirmed the transfer, saying: ""Arsenal Football Club announces that Ivory Coast international forward Gervinho will shortly join the Gunners, subject to a regulatory process."" Gervinho scored 15 goals last season as Lille collected the French league and cup double, while he has scored six goals in 27 matches for his country. Meanwhile, Wenger has also spoken about the futures of star midfielders Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri. Arsenal captain Fabregas has been strongly linked with a return to Barcelona in the past couple of years, while French international Nasri has just one year left on his contract, attracting the interest of Premier League rivals Manchester City and Manchester United. However, Wenger told reporters: ""Yes I expect Cesc to stay -- as simple as that. ""I have never spoken about what has happened behind closed doors but Cesc loves the club. ""We know the Barcelona story goes on for years now and we have to close that. Now we focus on the new season, hopefully with Cesc Fabregas."" And speaking about compatriot Nasri, Wenger added: ""I expect Nasri to stay as well. There is always speculation when a player has one year to go on his contract that he might leave, but Samir Nasri is very happy and committed to stay at the club. ""I hope he will sign a new contract but I am not the only one to decide that,"" continued Wenger. Meanwhile, Wenger did confirm that goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and striker Nicklas Bendtner, who are both absent from the trip to the Far East, are likely to leave Arsenal in the coming weeks. In other English transfer news, Stoke have completed the signing of injury-plagued former England central defender Jonathan Woodgate on a one-year contract. The 31-year-old Woodgate, who has also played for Leeds, Newcastle and Real Madrid during his career, was released by Tottenham at the end of last season. Elsewhere, Swiss international midfielder Gokhan Inler has completed his move from Udinese to Italian Serie A rivals Napoli. The 27-year-old has agreed personal terms and joined the southern-based side for a fee in the region of $18 million.","Arsenal agree to sign Ivory Coast striker Gervinho for an undisclosed fee .

"(CNN) -- In spite of heightened security due to a terror threat on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks, a South Carolina man was apparently able to sneak a stun gun into a professional football game and fired it into the crowd, police said Tuesday. Leroy T. McKelvey, 59, allegedly used the gun on three men in an upperdeck scuffle at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, during a Sunday match-up between the New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys, according to New Jersey Police Sgt. Julian Castellanos. The three men suffered minor injuries, he said. McKelvey was charged with three counts of aggravated assault, possession of a stun gun and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes. He was taken to Bergen County Jail and later released on $22,500 bail. McKelvey could not immediately be reached for comment. When asked about the security breach, National Football League spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league is ""always refining and improving our security procedures."" ""These procedures have been successful in keeping items that can cause serious injuries out of our stadiums,"" he said in a statement. ""We will continue to be vigilant in protecting the safety of our fans."" Mark Lamping, the chief executive of MetLife Stadium, said the stun gun involved in the incident was the size of a small cell phone. ""Procedures for pat downs established by the NFL and used at every game were in effect at all entry gates,"" he said in a statement. A video posted on YouTube apparently captures the immediate aftermath of the alleged attack, showing several Cowboys fans surrounding at least one person who is laying near the base of one of the stadium's seats. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the video.","NEW: Procedures for pat downs were in effect, stadium official says .

"(CNN) -- Going into Monday night's CNN/Tea Party Debate, the anticipation was that the two frontrunners -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- would continue their argument over who created more jobs or whose position on Social Security was more electable. But early on it became clear that Perry, who holds a double-digit lead over all of his rivals, would be everyone's target and one-time frontrunner Romney tried to bring Perry back closer to the pack and his other rivals tried to score points at the governor's expense. Here's how CNN's analysts and contributors saw the debate: . Who scored and who didn't? Dana Loesch, CNN contributor and conservative talk show host: I think the overall standout, Romney and Perry really went at each other, they shot each other in each other's foot. I think [U.S. Rep. Michele] Bachmann ultimately had some of the most solid answers of the night. If she expected to stay in or be in the top tier of candidates in this primary, she needed to be aggressive, hard-hitting and go after other candidates. That's what she did. ""Overall, I would give it to Bachmann. [Newt] Gingrich always does well, but he's been doing it for an incredibly long time. In terms of jobs, whenever Herman Cain spoke, every single time he spoke, he backed it up with a plan that he's already published on his website. Paul Begala, CNN contributor and Democratic strategist: ""This is, in fact, I think long-term, strategically, the real Achilles heel for governor Perry, that is where Michele Bachmann took it -- she took it to 'crony capitalism.' She's trying to suggest that Rick Perry will depart from conservative values if there is money to be made for lobbyists. If this notion begins to take hold that Perry might sell out those conservative principles because he's connected to a lobbyist, then Mrs. Bachmann may get back into the race, Mr. Romney may start to press this. When I talk to people in Texas, they think his Achilles heel is cronyism and pay to play. Romney vs Perry . David Gergen, CNN senior political analyst: ""There's no question that Romney and Perry will remain the frontrunners Romney has a better command of the facts. He's a more practiced debater. He gave one of the best answers of his entire campaign when he was asked how he would balance the budget. But Perry has the command presence, and even though people took shots at him as you said, he deflected reasonably well, he came in as a better debater, he was more even this time. ""He talks a lot of Texas. He's going to need to move beyond Texas. He's clearly going to have to beef himself up on the international side. I would have to tell you, Rick Perry walked in here as a frontrunner tonight. And I imagine he walked out as the frontrunner. Erick Erickson, CNN contributor and RedState.com blogger: ""I think this may be the first debate where Mitt Romney didn't come out the clear winner. Perry needed to do well. I think he did well. I don't think the Social Security exchange helps Mitt Romney at all at a Republican primary. He's foolish to continue, and he may want to go after Perry on immigration or HPV. I think the majority of Republican voters agree with Perry. For the life of me, I can't understand why Romney would go with this. [Michele] Bachman was going to make this a key point and backed down from this."" Gloria Borger, CNN chief political analyst: ""I think that Mitt Romney started chipping away at the economic miracle of the state of Texas. And it's clear he's going to continue to go back at that. He said, you know, when you're dealt four aces, it's easy to win the hand. And I remember that happening with [1988 Democratic presidential candidate] Michael Dukakis, talking about the ""Massachusetts Miracle.' They started chipping away at that, it was a big problem for him."" On the ideological battle within the Republican Party . Paul Begala, CNN contributor and Democratic strategist: Mitt Romney was cool, Rick Perry was hot. Mitt was factual and Rick was a little more emotional. It was really an interesting study in contrast. The real question is, which party? Not who won, but which party? If this is still the party of investment bankers who carry a putter at the country club, then Mitt Romney wins. If it's people carrying a pitchfork to a tea party rally, Rick Perry wins. In the hall it sure sounded from the audience, a strikingly conservative, almost radically conservative audience which helps Rick Perry. Ari Fleischer, CNN contributor and former President George W. Bush press secretary: ""Perry's gamble is that the American people want to push for greater change in entitlement programs, that they're ready for something fundamental. Mitt Romney's gamble is that they don't want to do anything bigger fundamental, they really just want an expert to go in and change things around the edges and make some smart reforms. ""Who is going to be ascendant? Will it be the tea party movement to change Washington or the more conventional traditional Republican -- keep what's there, make it a little better, a little more cost-efficient. This is the dynamic in play right now."" Borger: ""I think what you're seeing is this fight within the Republican Party, I couldn't help but watch the debate and you saw Jon Huntsman and Mitt Romney, they looked like the old-time, establishment Republican candidates struggling to kind of say, 'OK, this is the way we're going to take the party.' Mitt Romney, it's his turn to be nominated, he ran last time. ""And then you saw the other candidates, they're saying, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute, we're not going to go along with you.' And then you saw Rick Perry, essentially trying to walk both sides of that, saying, 'You know what, yes, we passed the DREAM Act in my state. Yes, I ordered this vaccine for young women,' something that tea party folks do not like, conservative Republicans don't like. ""Trying to walk both sides of that, and come across as somebody who can appeal to independent voters while also appealing to tea party Republicans. That's very difficult, but that's what I think we saw Rick Perry try to do, and we're going to continue to see him try to do that as he has to look at the general election."" On how this will play out into the general election . Fleischer: ""I think that Republicans have to be careful here that Social Security does not become the defining issue that divides them in this primary. They have to remember in these debates to bring it back to Barack Obama, to jobs, to debt and deficits. This is the core strength that have made Republicans so strong in this cycle. The bigger perspective cannot be lost as these debates continue."" Roland Martin, CNN contributor: ""If you're a Latino voter, the last thing you wanted to hear was some of the stuff you heard tonight. Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico will be critical states when it comes to November 2012. The GOP did themselves no favors tonight with Latino voters. ""Education did not come up in this debate at all. The only moment it came up was about abolishing the Department of Education. If you're a parent trying to get your kid educated, not a single candidate offered anything to speak to the crisis we have in this country when it comes to education. Major failure in that.""","Romney and Perry entered as frontrunners and left as frontrunners, said David Gergen .

"(CNN) -- More than 2,200 people have been killed since the start of mass protests in Syria in mid-March, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Monday. Navi Pillay spoke in Geneva, Switzerland at a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which met to discuss allegations of human rights violations in Syria. The meeting comes after the United Nations sent a humanitarian mission to Syria this weekend to look for effects of President Bashar al-Assad's protest crackdown. Pillay said that more than 2,200 people have been killed in the crackdown so far, with more than 350 people reportedly killed since the start of Ramadan. ""I wish to use this opportunity to once again call on the Syrian government to immediately and fully halt its crackdown on peaceful protests and ensure the immediate and unconditional release of all detained for their participation in peaceful demonstrations,"" she said during her remarks, according to a U.N.-provided transcript. Meanwhile in Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported new deaths in a continuing crackdown on pro-reform demonstrators. Two people were killed and four wounded early Monday morning in the city of Mesyaf in Hama province when regime supporters opened fire, the London-based activist group said. It also said that at least three people were killed and five injured in Homs, when gunmen opened fire on demonstrators participating in a protest timed to coincide with the U.N. delegation's visit. On Sunday, al-Assad rejected calls for his ouster and promised steps toward political reform. Speaking on Syrian state TV a day after the U.N. mission arrived in the country, al-Assad was asked about calls from European leaders for him to step down. ""What they say means nothing to us,"" he replied, according to a CNN translation. U.S. President Barack Obama made the same call last week, and the United States followed up by imposing new economic sanctions. The European Union's political security committee is considering an embargo on Syrian crude oil. Oil and gas make up about a quarter of Syria's economy, according to the International Monetary Fund. In his televised interview, al-Assad continued to deny that his military has targeted peaceful protesters, despite widespread reports from witnesses, medical officials and diplomats in the country. The U.N. team's arrival in Syria came just days after a U.N. fact-finding mission reported having found ""a pattern of human rights violations that constitutes widespread or systematic attacks against the civilian population, which may amount to crimes against humanity."" The fact-finding mission's report called on the Security Council to ""address in the strongest terms the killing of peaceful protesters and other civilians in Syria through the use of excessive force and other grave human rights violations; to call for an immediate cessation of attacks against the civilian population; and to consider referring the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.""

"(CNN) -- The uncle of a Utah motorcyclist pulled from underneath a burning car by a group of bystanders told his nephew's rescuers they are ""heroes to our family."" Tyler Riggs spoke to CNN's Piers Morgan one day after a group of construction workers, students and other bystanders turned into a ragtag team of first responders to save Brandon Wright, 21. The accident happened Monday on a street near Utah State University in Logan and was captured on video. ""I thank you on behalf of my family, and I know that my nephew Brandon will hope to thank you at some point, too. I know that you might be shy and want to dislodge the title, but you are heroes to our family,"" Riggs said, adding that his nephew is in good spirits. ""He was talking to us earlier and going through physical therapy and felt good after that. Things could have been much worse."" Sgt. Jason Olsen of the Logan police was the first officer on the scene. He was about to motion to a fellow responding officer to grab a jack when, ""I realized that these citizens had already organized and were just going to manually lift (the car) up."" The crash occurred when a BMW pulled out of a parking lot and in front of the motorcyclist. Jeff Curtis, assistant chief of Logan police, said the motorcyclist tried to avoid the car, which resulted in him laying the motorcycle down. After crashing, gas spilled out of the motorcycle and ignited, engulfing both the motorcycle and the front end of the car in flames, Curtis said. The motorcyclist became lodged underneath the burning vehicle. The video, shot by Chris Garff, shows several startled bystanders looking under the BMW as flames leap into the air. The crowd quickly grows to include a man in a suit, construction workers wearing hard hats, a woman in sandals and a young man carrying a backpack, the video shows. After one person in the group tries to pick up the blazing car, the crowd joins in and lifts the 4,000-pound vehicle. ""I do remember one gentleman saying, 'We need everybody to come and help lift,' and that's when everybody ran over,"" Olsen recalled. One of the bystanders drags the fallen motorcyclist from under the vehicle, the video shows. Wright was rushed to a hospital and was in stable condition after surgery Monday evening, Curtis said. The driver of the car was not seriously injured. The man Curtis believes to be the driver appears in the video dressed in a dark suit. He stood a little off to the side from the group and did not help lift the car, the video shows. After Wright is pulled from underneath the vehicle, the man in the suit walks over to look at the motorcyclist. ""He was in a shock,"" Curtis said about the driver, adding that any possible charges related to the traffic accident are pending. ""It was frightening,"" said Garff, who shot the scene from the ninth floor of a nearby building. ""You don't really see something like that and then when you do, it's inspiring. It gives us hope,"" he told HLN's ""Prime News."" Police are looking for the good Samaritans to recognize them at a city council meeting for their actions. Most have already been identified, Curtis said. Three of them, all Utah State University students, spoke to CNN Tuesday. Anvar Suyundikov said he tried not to think of the danger as he jumped in to help. ""At first, when I saw it was a fire, I didn't think about myself,"" said Suyundikov ""I thought about this poor guy underneath the car, and I thought the car was going to explode."" Another student, James Odei said, ""All that came to my mind was if it was my son or my kid brother or anybody that is known to me, the first thing I would have done was to help that person. So all I did was quickly rush and give a helping hand."" Abbass al-Sharif said he did not think he or the others who helped were heroes. ""We are just human beings trying to help another human being. It is like our human instinct,"" he said. But police believe the bystanders are heroes. ""Each of those people put their lives in danger as they do what they can to rescue Brandon,"" Curtis told ""Prime News."" The area where Wright crashed is highly trafficked, Olsen said. ""I think had this accident happened in a suburban area we wouldn't have gotten that kind of response -- we would have never had that kind of manpower,"" he said. Olsen added: ""It speaks volumes to what people will do in a tragic situation to help another person out."" CNN's Anna Rhett Miller and Brooke Baldwin contributed to this report.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 25 security personnel were killed when between 200 and 300 militants attacked border posts along Pakistan's border with Agfhanistan, Pakistan's military said Saturday. Those who died included Pakistani soldiers and police, the military said in a statement on its website, and two of the seven checkpoints attacked were overrun. Twenty of the militants, who came from across the border, were reportedly killed, the military said. Reinforcements are now being sent to the northwestern Chitral district. The attacks took place in areas that spanned roughly 125 km, a military official told CNN. ""It was a well coordinated attack involving a large number of militants,"" said the official, who asked not to be named because he's not authorized to speak to the media. Earlier, provincial government official Mian Iftikhar Hussain, the information minister for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, told CNN that 36 Pakistani security personnel had died. Fifteen militants were also killed, he said. The militants used both small and heavy weapons, said Rehmatullah Wazir, a senior government official from Chitral. Wazir said clashes continued between security forces and militants in some areas near the border. The Pakistani military said the militants were reported to be from Dir, Swat and Bajaur, three areas in northwest Pakistan where the military has sought over the past two years to remove insurgents. Saturday's attacks were the latest in a series of recent cross-border assaults from Afghanistan's Pech Valley and the provinces of Kunar and Nuristan, all areas from which U.S. troops began pulling out earlier this year as part of a strategy designed to bolster security in more populated areas of Afghanistan. Pakistani military officials say the withdrawal of U.S. troops has provided insurgents in the mountainous areas of eastern Afghanistan with safe havens that are used to launch cross-border attacks against Pakistani security forces. The attacks have raised tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with each country accusing the other of not doing enough to secure its border region. CNN's Nasir Habib and Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 25 security personnel died in attacks on border posts, Pakistan's military says .

"(CNN) -- A fire truck escorted the funeral procession of Shannon Stone, the veteran firefighter and Texas Rangers fan whose death at a baseball game prompted a national outpouring of condolences. Stone was buried Monday in his hometown of Brownwood, Texas. The 39-year-old firefighter fell to his death Thursday while trying to catch a ball at a Rangers game. He is survived by his wife, Jenny, and his son, Cooper. In the second inning of the ill-fated game, star outfielder Josh Hamilton tossed a souvenir ball into the stands after a batter hit a foul ball. Stone stuck out his glove and reached for the ball, but lost his balance and flipped over the railing of the outfield seats. He fell about 20 feet and crashed head-first into an area near a scoreboard, suffering fatal injuries. Stone died of blunt-force trauma, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner. Ronnie Hargis was seated in the stands near Stone and tried unsuccessfully to save him. ""Your first instinct is to reach out and grab him,"" Hargis told CNN's Don Lemon. ""I tried to grab him. I couldn't catch him. He went down. As he went by me I tried to grab him again and I missed and ... it looked like he was in slow motion as he was going to the ground. There was nothing I could do but watch him fall."" His 6-year-old son witnessed the tragic accident. ""It's just the cruelest of reminders of just how fragile human life can be,"" said Joe Trahan, sports anchor at CNN affiliate WFAA. ""The mind-boggling thing about this is that everyone's intent was right."" Rangers president Nolan Ryan, a Hall of Fame pitcher, said earlier that the club would review the height of railings at the stadium, even though they currently exceed the city's code limits. Trahan told Lemon that club management is already working on making changes at their stadium. ""I've spoken to Rangers officials, and they tell me that there are meetings that have already taken place with city leaders, meetings with architects at the ballpark, contractors. They're trying to find a permanent solution, not a stop-gap one."" But fan-awareness also plays a crucial role at stadiums, according to Trahan. ""This is a stark and cruel reminder that (safety) is everyone's responsibility when you go to the ballpark,"" he said, adding that he was surprised that injuries didn't happen more often, especially ""down the first and third base lines ... those are rocket shots coming off those bats.""

"(CNN) -- The NATO-led command in Afghanistan is investigating a raid that led to the deaths of six Afghans and claims of civilian casualties. The incident occurred Wednesday in the eastern province of Khost in an operation launched by Afghan and coalition forces, and the probe highlights the coalition's emphasis on avoiding civilian deaths. The force approached a building and ""was engaged with small arms fire."" ""Coalition forces take every allegation of civilian casualties seriously and will conduct a complete assessment of the engagement,"" NATO's International Security Assistance Force said in a statement on Thursday. President Hamid Karzai on Thursday ordered authorities to launch an investigation as well. Mubarez Zadran, a provincial government spokesman, told CNN that six civilians were killed in a residential area of Khost province's Matoon district and he said two others were wounded. ISAF had said it killed six fighters from the Haqqani network, a militant group with Taliban ties that operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan. One female civilian sustained non-life-threatening injuries, ISAF said. ""The target of the operation was a Haqqani leader responsible for indirect fire attacks against the Afghan National Army and the transfer of weapons and explosives throughout the district,"" ISAF said on Thursday. Mussa Majroh, a spokesman for the Khost education department, said a teacher and a student were among those killed in the night raid. Majroh said many people took to the streets to protest the killings. ""They were carrying the dead bodies with them too on the streets and to the front gate of governor's office in the capital of Khost province,"" Majroh said. Thie incident comes as the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said on Thursday in a report that the use of powerful improvised explosive devices -- IEDs -- by militants in Afghanistan has caused a ""dramatic"" hike in ""conflict-related civilian deaths"" in the first half of the year. Afghanistan saw a 15% mainly because of ""the use of landmine-like pressure plate improvised explosive devices by anti-government elements,"" according to the UNAMA's Mid-year Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict.","The incident occurs in Khost province .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's parliament on Saturday debated demands by a 74-year-old anti-corruption activist in what an opposition leader called a ""historic occasion"" for lawmakers to come together in the fight against graft. The discussion came on the 12th day of campaigner Anna Hazare's hunger strike calling for a powerful Lokpal, or citizen ombudsman, to deal with massive bribes and kickbacks. Talks with the government hit a roadblock over three of his demands, which include bringing members of India's lower bureaucracy under the new watchdog. The federal government put the case before parliament. Sushma Swaraj, leader of the opposition in the lower chamber of the national assembly, said her group agreed with the three points. She called Saturday's sitting a ""historic occasion,"" saying tens of thousands of Hazare supporters expect effective mechanisms to tackle corruption in their daily lives. A similar debate was also under way in the upper chamber -- the house of elders -- in India's parliament. It was, however, not immediately clear when legislation to establish a Lokpal would be passed. Saturday's meeting of the Indian parliament aimed at eliciting opinion of the federal legislature, composed of ruling and opposition parties, over setting up a tough anti-corruption institution. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee initiated the debate, describing it as an opportunity to show political will to handle corruption. ""I am sure that members of this house will seize this moment and demonstrate the commitment of the house in dealing with corruption which is gnawing at the vitals of our polity,"" Mukherjee told parliament. Hazare's fast -- a tactic adopted by India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi against the colonial rule -- has also drawn criticism. On Friday, lawmaker Rahul Gandhi, whose mother heads the governing Congress party, warned parliament not to allow the nation's democracy to be undermined, in an apparent disapproval of the high-profile hunger strike. ""Individuals have brought our country great gains. They have galvanized people in the cause of freedom and development. However, we must not weaken the democratic process,"" Gandhi, who is tipped by Indian media as a future prime minister, said in a speech. He thanked Hazare for articulating what he called larger public disillusionment with a system plagued by endemic corruption. But in his address, the 40-year-old general secretary of the Congress party cautioned against pressuring elected bodies. ""This (democratic) process is often lengthy and lumbering. But it is so in order to be inclusive and fair. It provides a representative and transparent platform where ideas are translated into laws,"" Gandhi said. ""A process divorced from the machinery of an elected government, or this house, that seeks to undo the checks and balances created to protect the supremacy of parliament sets a dangerous precedent for a democracy,"" he told lawmakers. Three of Gandhi's ancestors -- Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and his father, Rajiv Gandhi, -- have served as the country's prime minister in the past. Echoing current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's views that any institution alone cannot eradicate corruption, Gandhi described the proposed Lokpal as just one tool in the fight. ""Witnessing the events of the last few days, it would appear that the enactment of a single bill will usher in a corruption-free society. I have serious doubts about this belief,"" Gandhi said. ""An effective Lokpal law is only one element in the legal framework to combat corruption. The Lokpal institution alone cannot be a substitute for a comprehensive anti-corruption code. A set of effective laws is required.""","Lawmakers debate the demand on the 12th day of Anna Hazare's fast .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Iraq's foreign ministry summoned the Turkish ambassador in Baghdad on Thursday to deliver a diplomatic letter protesting Turkey's aerial and artillery bombardment of northern Iraq. Turkish armed forces have been striking what the country calls PKK safe havens in Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region. About 90 to 100 Kurdish rebel fighters have been killed since the incursion started, Turkey said Tuesday. Around 80 people have been wounded in the push, the military said. Targets included rebel barracks, caves, ammunition depots and anti-aircraft positions in the region, part of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region. On Sunday night, a PKK spokesman said no rebels had been killed. PKK refers to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which the United States considers a terror group. Dozens of Turkish soldiers have been killed over the last month, in a clear escalation of the conflict that has raged intermittently between Kurdish separatists and the Turkish state since 1984. More than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict, many of them ethnic Kurds. The Kurds are Turkey's largest ethnic minority.","Around 80 people have been wounded, Turkish military says .

"(CNN) -- Call it a security version of the speedy supermarket checkout. Passengers traveling with one carry-on item now have the option of going through an express security lane at Pittsburgh International Airport. ""This move comes as a result of more people carrying more items through the checkpoint to avoid airline bag fees,"" said Bradley D. Penrod, executive director and CEO of the Allegheny County Airport Authority. ""The express lane is a way to streamline the wait at the checkpoint for those who pack light and fit it all in one bag."" The lane, just to the right of the airport's main security checkpoint and staffed by a Transportation Security Administration employee, began operations Tuesday. Only travelers with one item -- such as a purse, a briefcase, a computer case -- are allowed to use the express lane. Jackets aren't counted as an extra item, but anything else would require passengers to use the other security lines. Traveler reaction so far has been positive, said JoAnn Jenny, a spokeswoman for the Allegheny County Airport Authority. ""It's been hugely popular,"" Jenny said. ""People were really excited about it."" She said she believes Pittsburgh International is the first U.S. airport to try this particular concept, though other airports have versions of express lanes, including one dedicated for expert travelers, frequent fliers and so on. Keep your shoes on at the airport? Maybe . It's not a pilot program that may go nationwide but rather a fix for a ""Pittsburgh-specific issue,"" Jenny said. Long security lines at the airport over the summer -- sometimes an hour or longer during peak periods -- had officials scrambling for a solution. So they approached the TSA and received the thumbs up for the express lane concept. ""TSA works with airports across the country to provide the best possible security in the most efficient way possible,"" said Greg Soule, a spokesman for the agency. ""The program at Pittsburgh International Airport is one example of TSA partnering with airports to improve the passenger experience while providing world-class security."" Pittsburgh International hopes the express lane will get more people thinking about packing light so that when the busy holiday season comes around, most will be traveling with just one carry-on, Jenny said.","Pittsburgh International Airport opens an express security lane .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The man chosen to lead the Atlanta Public School system wasted no time making changes in the wake of a cheating scandal that could lead to criminal charges against some principals and teachers. Interim Superintendent Erroll B. Davis Jr. replaced four area superintendents and a school principal at a board meeting Monday night. Hours later, he told CNN's Randi Kaye that children had been failed, and ""we can't allow that to happen, and we can't allow anyone who was involved with that remain in our system."" It's the first step taken by Davis to right the alleged wrongs of nearly 200 educators. The personnel changes were announced less than a week after an investigation revealed that dozens of educators had falsified standardized tests. ""I don't know why it went on,"" Davis told Kaye, but, he said, the district must ""make it clear what our values are.""  Davis placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of the administration. ""I believe that all failures in any industry are leadership failures,"" Davis said. ""Leadership is accountable for every outcome that takes place under their watch."" The school board has given Davis approval to mandate ethics training for employees and provide remedial help to perhaps thousands of Atlanta Public Schools students who may have improperly advanced because of the cheating. ""We will identify those children, and we will make the requisite investments to remediate the wrongs that were done against them,"" Davis told CNN. Dozens of Atlanta public school educators falsified standardized tests or failed to address such misconduct in their schools, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal said a week ago. He was unveiling the results of a state investigation that confirmed widespread cheating in city schools dating as far back as 2001. Investigators said 178 teachers and principals working at 44 schools were involved in the cheating scandal. The educators, including 38 principals, were either directly involved in erasing wrong answers on a key standardized test or they knew -- or should have known -- what was going on, according to the governor's office. Deal's office said 82 of the educators acknowledged involvement, according to the report. Six principals declined to answer investigators' questions and invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Deal said. The investigation's findings have been forwarded to the state teacher licensing board, Deal said. That agency could take disciplinary action against the educators involved. Whether to bring criminal charges will be up to prosecutors, Deal said. The state's report indicated there was a climate of cheating and performance-at-all-costs during the tenure of former Superintendent Beverly Hall.  It's a charge Hall has denied. But Davis said there was ""a culture of fear and intimidation"" that needed to be changed. ""People felt that it was easier to cheat than to miss their goals and objective,"" he said.  But he also agreed with board members who said it was important to remember that many Atlanta teachers did their jobs well. ""There were so many teachers who have not made ethical compromises who were doing wonderful things on a daily basis,"" Davis said. The cheating was brought to light after marked improvements in the district's performance on the 2009 statewide Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests (CRCT) revealed a pattern of incorrect test answers being erased and replaced with correct answers. Investigators compared the results with test results from other Georgia schools and found that such patterns did not occur normally, Deal said. That the district's CRCT results fell in 2010 further confirmed the findings, according to the report. Former board chairman Khaatim Sherrer El resigned his District 2 seat at a Monday night meeting. He said he was leaving to accept an out-of-state position, according to the district. The scandal followed a former Atlanta administrator to her new job in Texas. A Texas school district placed its new superintendent, Kathy Augustine, on paid leave effective Tuesday, according to a statement from Augustine.  She had served as a deputy superintendent for the Atlanta Public Schools. Augustine has denied any role in the reported cheating. ""I've read the investigative report from cover to cover, and nowhere does it identify anyone as saying I encouraged, directed or condoned cheating,"" Augustine said last week. ""That's because I did not."" She will be on leave while the DeSoto Independent School District considers what to do about her appointment. Davis said the nature and extent of any charges against educators involved in the scandal will be determined by the district attorney's office. The principals and teachers accused of cheating will also be referred to the Professional Standards Commission to determine whether they will be allowed to keep their credentials, according to Davis. U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said the scandal proves there are no shortcuts to success. ""This unfortunate incident highlights the need for transparency and accountability throughout our education system,"" Duncan said in a statement last week. ""Having good information to measure student progress is an absolute bedrock requirement in ensuring that schools are preparing our children for success."" In a bid to increase stability as it seeks to overcome the scandal and receive full reaccreditation, the board extended Davis' contract through June 2012. Davis recently retired as chancellor of the University System of Georgia.","""There was a culture of fear and intimidation,"" said Interim Superintendent Erroll B. Davis .

"(CNN Student News) -- July 6, 2011 . Download a PDF map related to today's show: . • Kennedy Space Center . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi! We're launching a special edition of CNN Student News this week. As the space shuttle program wraps up, we're taking a look back - and a look forward - at NASA's space program. First Up - Last Shuttle Launch . AZUZ: The U.S. has been launching shuttles for 30 years. They are the world's first re-usable spacecraft. They launch like a rocket and land like a plane. Atlantis, Challenger, Columbia, Discovery and Endeavour: These five orbiters have launched more than 600 astronauts into space. This video you're seeing right here highlights some of their achievements. Over the course of 134 shuttle flights, these crews have logged millions of miles in space and carried thousands of tons of cargo. The space shuttle has served as America's main transport for crews and supplies to the international space station. Shuttle crews have also repaired space equipment, like the Hubble Telescope. They've launched new satellites, and they've done experiments that can't be done on Earth. When the shuttle was first announced, the idea was that shuttle launches would be cheap enough to happen every week. But it actually costs about half a billion dollars to launch a shuttle, and NASA only ever planned a few missions each year. So, what's NASA's plans for the shuttles' retirement? Each one of them will become an exhibit in museums across America. So maybe one day, you might even get to go inside one. Now, we're going to hear from someone who not only gets to go inside a shuttle, he gets to fly in one too: the commander of Atlantis's latest mission, speaking a few weeks before the last scheduled mission. CHRISTOPHER J. FERGUSON, ATLANTIS COMMANDER: I don't think that the full magnitude of the moment will really hit us until the wheels have stopped on the runway. I'm not sure words will really be able to capture -- for the crew and for the entire shuttle work force -- just how much the shuttle program has meant to us for the last 30 years. Shoutout . CHERYL CASTRO, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Which constellation is named for a hunter in Greek mythology? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Capricorn, B) Orion, C) Ursa Major or D) Scorpio? You've got three seconds -- GO! Orion is the mythological hunter who can also be found in the stars. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! NASA's Next Steps . AZUZ: Orion is also the name of a new program at NASA. It's expected to be the replacement for the space shuttle program. Americans could be headed back to the moon or into deep space toward Mars. Now, those missions are a long way off. Part of the Orion program did go on the road recently though, and WTXL reporter Greg Angel got a chance to check it out. (BEGIN VIDEO) DMARCUS MCDONALD, STUDENT: It flies into space and looks at stars or moons or other planets. GREG ANGEL, WTXL REPORTER: Dmarcus McDonald is talking about Orion. This capsule, touted as the future of NASA, expected to one day carry man into deep space. CHARLES OHBAUGH, NASA ASTRONAUT: What this vehicle will allow us to do is hopefully go beyond lower Earth orbit, on to the moon and hopefully to Mars, ultimately, is our goal. ANGEL: But 34 million miles from Mars, here on Earth, Orion is getting a lot of attention during this special stop in Tallahassee. Dee Arnold drove in from Valdosta, Georgia to check it out before Orion is taken to its final destination at Kennedy Space Center. DEE ARNOLD, VALDOSTA, GEORGIA: I just like things that go on with the space program, and I just think it's awesome. I just wanted to see the next thing that NASA was going to do, the next part of space explorations. NASA ANNOUNCER: Three...two...one...launch! ANGEL: The Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, as it's called, will likely be in line to replace the shuttle program. LINDA SINGLETON, NASA: We're excited and very passionate about the work we do on this program, and we hope to launch our first orbital test flight as early as 2013, so we're ready to get on with the next program. ANGEL: While there's still a lot of work to be done, according to NASA, this spacecraft should eventually be capable of sustaining a crew of up to six astronauts on deep space missions that could last anywhere from six days for a lunar fly-by, to up to 900 days for a Mars exploration mission. (END VIDEO) Blog Promo . AZUZ: There's debate among scientists on this issue and we know you've got some opinions on it, too. Where should America go next? To the moon? Trips to Mars? Somewhere else? Or should we just stay home? Send us your thoughts about the end of the shuttle program and the start of the next space program on our blog. You'll find that at CNNStudentNews.com. Goodbye . AZUZ: Before we go, the shuttle program may be on its last Endeavour. And NASA's not likely to find the lost continent of Atlantis. But that doesn't mean the agency isn't going to be looking for its next Discovery. So, while NASA moves forward, we'll leave you with a look back. We hope you're enjoying your summer so far.

"(CNN) -- Wladimir Klitschko has told CNN Sport that he believes he has put a touch of reality into David Haye's life, after winning their heavyweight unification fight in Hamburg earlier this month. Klitschko, along with elder brother Vitali, spoke to CNN in London as they showed off all five belts and the Ring Magazine belt they now hold jointly between them. Both brothers are still angry with the way Haye bad-mouthed them before the fight, but Wladimir believes that his unanimous points victory might now lead to the Briton altering the way he behaves in the future. Klitschko dominates Haye in heavyweight showdown . ""It was definitely nice to beat David. Aside from taking his belt it was good to just show him the way to behave properly -- it was kinda reality rehab for David Haye to become a better person,"" Wladimir told Don Riddell. ""He will now be better in the ring, and outside the ring, because I think he lifted himself off the ground a bit and we have put him back down on the ground. ""I'm very happy to achieve my goal as a therapist, as Doctor Klitschko for David Haye, and everything that is happening to him is good experience that he cannot buy in a shop,"" added Wladimir. ""You have to gain it in your life and that's what's happening to David Haye right now, so it's a belt for me but it's also a lesson for him for the future."" Wladimir also revealed that the victory over Haye was the highlight of his career so far, made even more special by the atmosphere generated by the 45,000 supporters in the Volksparkstadion. ""This fight was really something special for me even though it was a very rainy night. ""The stadium was amazing and there were fans present from all over the world, the United States, UK, former Soviet republics and Germany,"" continued Wladimir. ""Being live on TV was also special, but you don't really think about TV because you are focused on the fight, so you feel the atmosphere of the stadium instead. ""You feel the fans, how they scream, how they support, it was definitely something special for me and I will never forget this fight.""","Wladimir Klitschko tells CNN he has put some 'reality' into David Haye's life .

"(CNN) -- The scandal embroiling the empire of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News International might extend from London to Washington, legal experts not personally involved in the unfolding matter said Monday. The potential liability flows from journalists at individual newspapers, such as the recently defunct News of the World, to its parent, News International, to its parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States. ""The allegation so far with this phone hacking scandal includes a component where someone within News Corp.'s organization perhaps made payments to London police officers to perhaps obtain information that would thus allow News of the World to write newspapers and sell newspapers,"" said Mike Koehler, a professor of business law at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. If true, that might violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which Koehler described as ""a U.S. law that generally prohibits the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official for a business purpose. ""So, there does seem to be a basis for a U.S. investigation at this point."" If anyone at News Corp. participated in payments to police officers or authorized such payments or even knew about them and failed to stop them, the case could wind up in the lap of the U.S. Department of Justice. The potential implications for the Murdoch media empire are numerous and none of them are good, Koehler said. ""Many FCPA enforcement actions have what I call 'a point of entry' -- a set of limited, discrete facts that give rise to the inquiry in the first place. But it's also very common for the 'where else?' question to be asked on the theory that, if News Corp. employees within the organization were making these payments to London police officers, perhaps others in this organization -- all over the world, for that matter -- were making similar payments."" The decision to close the News of the World followed accusations that it illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities, and claims it may have bribed police officers. Police said last week that they had identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone-hacking. ""There could be potential exposure,"" concurred Don Zarin, author of ""Doing Business Under The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act"" and a partner with the Washington-based law firm of Holland & Knight. The act stipulates that U.S.-listed companies, their employees or agents may not make bribes to foreign officials. A second portion of the law applies to accounting requirements for public companies. ""They have to keep books and records in reasonable detail that reflect the transactions,"" Zarin said. So, if a bribe was made and not properly noted, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the DOJ could each have a case, he said. A telephone call or an e-mail from an editor in London to his or her boss in New York could prove key, he said. ""If you send an e-mail to the boss saying, 'I'm going to pay $10,000 to police officers for this information,' that would provide the jurisdictional basis or potential liability on the part part of possibly the British employees."" If any employee of News Corp., which is listed in the United States, knew about and authorized such a payment, ""they could have potential exposure,"" he said. And if Rupert Murdoch -- the 80-year-old Australian-born head of News Corp. who became a U.S. citizen in 1985 -- knew what was going on and authorized it -- even implicitly -- ""he could have some potential exposure,"" Zarin said. The penalties can be severe, including jail time and fines, he said. Ignorance confers no protection, he said. ""The SEC has brought cases against U.S. companies who had no knowledge of what foreign subsidiaries were doing, but had misbooked it,"" he said, adding that the SEC blamed the companies for not having set up the internal controls that would have caught the illegal behavior. A DOJ spokeswoman said she could not comment on possible Justice Department involvement. If the charges wind up being nothing more than civil accounting violations, the SEC would handle the case and DOJ would not become involved, said James Tillen, coordinator of the FCPA Practice Group at Miller and Chevalier, a Washington-based law firm specializing in international regulatory issues, tax and litigation. That would still carry a major risk to those involved. ""The SEC has a lot of bite in significant fines, penalties, prohibiting people from serving as officers in public companies,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""That can derail a career quickly."" But a criminal prosecution by DOJ would be the most to fear, since it would carry the potential of jail time, he said. SEC fines can range up to $25 million per violation in such cases, but totals regularly exceed $100 million because the agency can force the company to disgorge ill-gotten gains. The DOJ can impose a criminal fine on individuals of up to $100,000 and five years in prison for each count on a bribery charge, he said. Multiple counts could lead to higher fines and sequential prison terms. But fines are typically pegged to how much a company or an individual gained as a result of the crime, he said. That can be easy to figure out when the subject is a contract, but any case involving Murdoch's empire might present more of a challenge. ""How many more newspapers did you sell?"" he asked. Still, U.S. authorities may choose not to intervene at all. ""If the Department of Justice were satisfied that the U.K. had sufficient ability to prosecute this, then they may step aside,"" Tillen said. ""If they weren't satisfied, then they could be very interested."" England passed an aggressive law, the U.K. Bribery Act, which became law on July 1, but it is not retroactive, Tillen said. The predecessor legislation that would apply ""is a hodgepodge"" of laws, some of which date back more than a century, he said. ""That's part of the problem."" Still, as things now stand, the nearly 4,000 miles that separate Washington from London won't put off U.S. investigators. ""Of the 10 largest fines in FCPA history, eight have been against foreign companies,"" Tillen said. But that may change. Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, has criticized the act as putting U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage and held hearings last month intended to water it down, Tillen said. ""The criticism is that it's being overly enforced by SEC and DOJ to reach activities that it shouldn't reach,"" such as taking officials out for free meals, he said. A spokeswoman for Sensenbrenner provided CNN with a statement Monday from the congressman. ""I plan to introduce a bill that would reform the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and bring it up-to-date with the changing world,"" Sensenbrenner said in the statement. ""We need to bring clarity to what is and what is not illegal. My intent is to make sure that the stop signs and red lights are clearly visible for American companies doing commerce internationally. ""Right now, there is confusion regarding who qualifies as a foreign official. Foreign law enforcement officers are clearly foreign officials and it is absolutely absurd to imply that any changes to the FCPA would change that status or permit U.S. businesses to bribe policemen,"" he added.","The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits bribing foreign officials .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A prominent California Democrat campaign fund manager charged with defrauding a state legislator of $677,181 is in settlement negotiations with federal prosecutors, a law enforcement source said Tuesday. Kinde Durkee, whose Durkee & Associates firm is based in Burbank, California, has been charged with two counts of mail fraud regarding the alleged misappropriation of $677,181 in campaign funds belonging to California Assemblyman Jose Solorio, a Democrat whose office is based in Anaheim, authorities said. The law enforcement source asked for anonymity because the source wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations. Durkee is accused of filing false disclosure reports to hide the misappropriations, according to an affidavit by FBI Agent Reginald Coleman. Durkee, who appears to have signature authority over more than 400 bank accounts, including those for political campaigns, allegedly moved ""substantial"" sums of money from client campaign committees to her firm's accounts or other campaign accounts, Coleman said in the affidavit. Durkee also allegedly spent funds from clients' accounts to make her firm's payroll and to pay for her mortgage, her American Express bill, her mother's assisted living facility expenses and other personal expenses, Coleman's affidavit said. In an interview with the FBI on September 1, ""Ms. Durkee admitted that she had been misappropriating her clients' money for years, and that forms she filed with the state were false,"" Coleman wrote. Durkee and her attorney could not be reached by CNN for comment on Tuesday. In the wake of the charges, U.S. Rep. Susan Davis, D-California, has accused Durkee of stealing ""upwards of $250,000 in campaign funds,"" according to a letter that Davis sent to her supporters on Saturday. Durkee was also Davis' campaign fund manager, a Davis spokeswoman said. ""As this scandal emerges, she may well become known as the Bernie Madoff of campaign finance treasurers,"" Davis said about Durkee in the letter to supporters. Lauren Horwood, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Sacramento, California, said prosecutors are looking at Davis' accusations and the campaign accounts of other Democrats that Durkee was managing. ""The investigation is looking at all of the accounts of clients of Kinde Durkee,"" including those of elected Democrats, Horwood said. On her firm's website, Durkee states: ""We have performed accounting and reporting for political campaigns day-in and day-out since 1972. Accounting, reporting and compliance management for political campaigns and nonprofits is quite different from standard business accounting; we understand the differences because we've specialized in political campaigns."" Durkee, who was arrested earlier this month and released on $200,000 bond, will return to federal court for a preliminary hearing on October 19 in Sacramento, Horwood said. CNN's Casey Wian and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","Kinde Durkee is a prominent campaign fund manager for California Democrats .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Work to recover bodies from the scene of a pipeline explosion in a densely populated Nairobi slum has ended, Kenya Red Cross said Tuesday. Red Cross officials said 82 bodies had been recovered. Police pegged the number at 76. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. The blast Monday morning flattened homes, reduced some bodies to dust and forced a massive evacuation of the Sinai slum amid fears that big pools of leaked fuel could ignite, police and Kenya Red Cross officials said. The fire erupted around 10 a.m. local time, possibly as a group of people were siphoning fuel from the pipeline, which runs through the Lunga Lunga industrial area, officials said. Coming to a precise accounting of the toll may be difficult because so many of the victims were found huddled together and severely burned, Carol Nduta, a Kenya Red Cross emergency medical instructor and dispatcher who traveled to the scene, said Monday. Some of the bodies were burned to dust, she said. In addition to the dead, 118 people were hospitalized, police said. The precise cause of the incident is under investigation. Kenya Pipeline Co., the state-owned petroleum company that owns the pipeline, said in a statement Monday night that it had detected a spill from a bypass line in the Sinai community on Monday morning and immediately moved to shut it down. State-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation quoted Prime Minister Raila Odinga as saying the incident occurred after a mechanism on the pipeline failed, allowing fuel to spill into a drainage ditch, where it then ignited. Police, however, said the incident may have occurred after someone punctured the pipeline in an effort to steal fuel. Fatalities from fuel leak accidents are common in Kenya. Scores of residents scramble to scoop up fuel whenever there is a leak or a tanker is involved in an accident. In 2009, more than 100 people died in a fire after an oil tanker overturned in Molo, in western Kenya. In that incident, someone trying to take some of the fuel lit a cigarette, starting the fire. A 2009 article in a Kenyan newspaper, The Daily Nation, discussed concerns of such a fire in the Sinai slum, where residents built shanties and even a church next to or even on top of the pipeline, according to the Daily Nation. ""I don't think there will ever be a fire, but you never know,"" the newspaper quoted one resident who it said had refused to move away from the pipeline despite eviction notices from the pipeline's owner.

"Washington (CNN) -- BP, Transocean and Halliburton all share responsibility for the deadly explosion that resulted in the April 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, according to the final federal report on the matter released Wednesday. The three companies ""violated a number of federal offshore safety regulations,"" according to the report, which includes a series of recommendations for improving drilling safety. The report, issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, concludes that a key cause of the explosion was a faulty cement drilling barrier at the Macondo well site. ""The precise reasons for the failure of the production casing cement job are not known,"" the report states.  But the disaster was ""the result of poor risk management, last minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling"" at the site. BP was ""ultimately responsible"" for operations at the site ""in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment,"" the report concludes. But Transocean, the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig, was also ""responsible for conducting safe operations and for protecting personnel onboard."" Meanwhile, Halliburton -- a BP contractor -- was ""responsible for conducting the cement job, and ... had certain responsibilities for monitoring the well,"" the report says. A spokesman for BP said the company agrees with report's conclusion. ""The Deepwater Horizon accident was the result of multiple causes, involving multiple parties, including Transocean and Halliburton,"" Scott Dean said.  ""BP (has) acknowledged its role in the accident and has taken concrete steps to further enhance safety. ... We continue to encourage other parties to acknowledge their roles in the accident and make changes to help prevent similar accidents in the future."" Lou Colasuonno, a Transocean spokesman, said the report ""confirms that the primary cause of the incident was the catastrophic failure of the cement in the Macondo well,"" but his company continues to take ""strong exception to (any) criticisms of the Horizon drill crew."" Halliburton continued to deny any responsibility for the tragedy. The report ""incorrectly attributes the operation decisions to Halliburton,"" said Zelma Branch, a Halliburton spokeswoman.  ""Every contributing cause where Halliburton is named, the operational responsibility lies solely with BP.  Halliburton remains confident that all the work we performed with respect to the Macondo well was completed in accordance with BP's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions."" The explosion on the rig led to more than 200 million gallons of oil being released into the Gulf.  Eleven people working on the rig died in the explosion, while 16 others were injured. Besides the oil, hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersant went into the water.  At the peak of the crisis, in June 2010, 37% of Gulf waters -- a total of 88,522 square miles -- were closed to fishing due to contamination. The U.S. government announced plans in August to hold its first oil and natural gas lease sale in the Gulf since the incident. The proposed sale, scheduled for mid-December in New Orleans, will include more than 20 million acres in the western Gulf, according a recent statement from the Department of the Interior.

"(CNN) -- Serbia's Davis Cup champions hope that world No. 1 Novak Djokovic will be able to play in Friday's opening rubber of the semifinal against Argentina in Belgrade. The 24-year-old arrived in his home city on Thursday following his epic four-hour U.S. Open final victory over Rafael Nadal in New York on Monday. He has been drawn to play David Nalbandian, but his teammates are prepared for the possibility that history will repeat itself in the tennis teams event. Last year Djokovic also played in a Monday final at Flushing Meadows, that time losing to Nadal, and pulled out of his opening singles against the Czech Republic after falling ill. ""We'll see how he feels,"" said Victor Troicki, who clinched the decisive rubber in last December's final against France. ""If he's not that great, I'll be definitely ready to play the first match against Nalbandian. ""Last year I found out three hours before the match that I would play, but this time I'm aware that he might not play if he's not right."" Nalbandian, who lost to Nadal in the third round at the U.S. Open, has been struggling with injuries this year but holds a 3-1 career record over Troicki. The former world No. 3, now ranked 74th, is 1-4 against Djokovic -- who has won 64 of 66 matches this year. ""David has been a main feature for Argentina in Davis Cup for the last few years, he's a real cup player,"" Argentina captain Tito Vazquez told the tournament's website. ""He's been trying quite hard to come back on the circuit. He played an excellent first set against Nadal in the U.S. Open, and he's a player who's capable of beating anybody, so that's why we chose him."" The second singles rubber sees Serbia No. 2 Janko Tipsarevic take on former world No. 4 Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion who is resurrecting his career after a year out with wrist problems. Tipsarevic and Nenad Zimonjic were drawn to face Juan Ignacio Chela and Juan Monaco in Saturday's doubles tie, but that line-up could yet change depending on Friday's results. In the second semifinal, last year's runners-up France travel to Cordoba to play Nadal's Spain on his favored clay surface. The French won 5-0 in his absence last year, but may struggle without injured world No. 7 Gael Monfils -- their best clay player. Nadal will play Richard Gasquet in the opening rubber, then Gilles Simon will take over as France's No. 1 against David Ferrer. Nadal has beaten 15th-ranked Gasquet in all nine professional encounters, while world No. 11 Simon's only win over Ferrer came on Cincinnati's hard-courts this year after two clay defeats in 2007. ""I know exactly what he's going to do,"" Simon said of his fifth-ranked opponent. ""He's a real warrior on the court, but I know that I can win and I have to keep believing that every moment."" In the doubles, Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco will play France's Michael Llodra and world No. 10 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who has struggled on clay this year but may be given a chance in the reverse singles.","Novak Djokovic drawn to play David Nalbandian in opening tie of Davis Cup semifinal .

"(CNN) -- The lawyer for a U.S. man being held in Aruba in connection with the case of a missing American woman urged authorities on Sunday to release his client. Gary Giordano, 50, was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner, 35, was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. ""Today, 9 days later, 4 voluntary interviews, 2 site visits, and more than 30 statements coming from different sources including witnesses and professionals, we can not deduce that there is hard proof to sustain a demand by the public prosecutor against our client,"" Giordano's attorney, Michael Lopez, said in a written statement. According to Aruban prosecutors, the missing woman and the suspect arrived on the island July 31 from the United States. Authorities search phosphate mines on Aruba . Lopez said last week that his client came to Aruba on vacation with a female friend he had met on a dating site and has known for years. Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, he allegedly said. Lopez denied statements by prosecutors that his client is no longer cooperating with authorities in the investigation. The attorney said in his statement Sunday that Giordano, whom he identified by his initials, GG, has given ""all possible cooperation."" ""The client has his own business and family in the United States. He has no reason whatsoever to obstruct any investigation,"" Lopez said. He added that his client could be returned to Aruba ""in case any legal proof shows up."" This weekend, authorities said that crews searching for the missing woman have looked in Aruban phosphate mines. Gardner's boyfriend speaks to HLN's Dr. Drew . Articles of clothing were found Friday in one mine, but authorities had not determined whether they are related to the disappearance of Gardner, Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein told CNN. FBI agents on Friday searched Giordano's Gaithersburg, Maryland, home, Special Agent Rich Wolf told CNN. Agents, wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes, arrived around 8:40 p.m. Friday. About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. Stein said Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. Although officials have stopped actively searching for Gardner, they are continuing to seek evidence in the case. ""In anticipation of any possible reason of prolongation of the client's detention, we can state that no felony has been committed by him,"" Lopez said in his Sunday statement. ""The Department of Justice at this time does not have any basis to request prolongation of his detention.""","Gary Giordano is being held in connection with Robyn Gardner's disappearance .

"(CNN) -- A Southern California man who attracted widespread attention for allegedly throwing his 7-year-old son overboard during a harbor cruise was charged Wednesday with felony child abuse and endangerment as well as misdemeanor resisting an officer, the Orange County District Attorney's office said. Sloan Steven Briles, 35, of Irvine, California, is also accused of being under the influence of alcohol on August 28 when he tossed his son into the path of boat traffic in Newport Beach Harbor, said Susan Kang Schroeder, chief of staff for the prosecutor's office. Briles, who is free on $100,000 bail, is scheduled to be arraigned September 26 in Newport Beach, the prosecutor's office said. If convicted of both charges, he faces a maximum sentence of six years in prison, authorities said. Briles recently told a Los Angeles TV news station that he did nothing wrong. Briles told CNN affiliate KTLA, ""We were having fun, it was a harbor cruise!"" He said he did not hit his son and he ""did nothing except jump in the water with my kid."" Asked if he would have done the same thing had he not been drinking, Briles responded, ""Absolutely."" Briles also disputed the sheriff's and witnesses' account of the event and said it was just a joke. ""We jumped in together,"" Briles told the affiliate. ""We thought it would be funny. We were just screwing around."" Briles, who's divorced, was on the tour boat Queen with his two sons -- the other is age 6 -- when he got into an argument with his girlfriend, the sheriff's office said. The boat takes passengers past Newport Beach houses that are or were occupied by celebrities, including the home where the late John Wayne lived, authorities said. His 7-year-old son became upset about the argument and started crying, authorities said. Briles allegedly poked his 7-year-old son in the chest and repeatedly slapped him in the face, making him cry, prosecutors said in a statement Wednesday. The boy asked his father to stop, prosecutors said. The father took the boy to the bow of the boat and told him, "" 'If you don't stop crying, I'm going to throw you overboard,' "" a sheriff's department spokesman said. The dad then picked up his son and threw him about 10 feet over the side of the tour boat, prosecutors said. The first mate stalled the vessel and steered it to shield the boy from being struck by another boat, and the captain threw a life ring to the crying boy as he treaded water, prosecutors said. The father then jumped into the water ""to avoid the angry passengers on the Queen who began to yell at him,"" according to the statement released by Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas. Prosecutors allege the father made ""no attempt to swim to his son's aid."" Another passing boat helped the boy out of the water, but the Queen's crew asked that boat ""not to help Briles, who was eventually pulled back onto the Queen,"" the prosecutor's media announcement said. When sheriff's deputies who patrol the harbor approached Briles on the boat, he allegedly ignored their orders to stand, struggled with them and made his body go limp, prosecutors said. Deputies had to drag him from the tour boat to the sheriff's harbor patrol boat, prosecutors said. There were 85 people on the tour boat, authorities said. Deputies took the two boys to their harbor station and later turned them over to their mother, a sheriff's spokesman said. CNN's Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.","Sloan Steven Briles, 35, of Irvine, California, is charged with felony child abuse .

"(CNN) -- Two crew members have died after an engine room fire on a Norwegian cruise ship, Norwegian police confirmed Thursday. Nine people have been taken to the hospital, a spokeswoman for Sunnmore police district told CNN. There were 55 crew on board the ship, MS Nordlys. All 207 passengers who were aboard the ship have been safely evacuated and taken to a hotel in the town of Alesund, operator Hurtigruten ASA said. They are of various nationalities. Two of the crew members are seriously injured, Borghild Eldoen, a spokeswoman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Centers for southern Norway, told CNN. One has been taken to a specialist burns hospital in Bergen, Norway's second city. She said police suspected an explosion had occurred in the engine room. The fire is now under control but firefighters are battling to stabilize the multi-deck ship, which is taking on water, with the use of pumps, Eldoen said. Everybody on board has now been accounted for and no one is believed missing, she added. The cruise ship was operating on a popular tourist route from Bergen, to the small town of Kirkenes in the country's far northeast when the fire broke out, forcing the vessel to stop at Alesund, CNN affiliate TV2 reported. Alesund, a town of some 40,000 people surrounded by fjords, is 226 kilometers (147 miles) north of Bergen. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Hurtigruten staff in Alesund are booking guests on to alternative vessels or making arrangements for them to travel home, the company said. The 400 foot-long Nordlys, built in 1994, has 475 berths for passengers and can carry 45 cars.

"(CNN) -- Former first lady Betty Ford was remembered Tuesday as a woman whose disclosures about her personal battles showed courage and grace and brought encouragement to others. ""She was a tireless advocate for those struggling,"" said former first lady Rosalynn Carter. ""She was never afraid to speak the truth."" Ford, who died Friday at age 93, raised awareness of issues involving women's rights, cancer, alcoholism and substance abuse during and after her stint as first lady. Carter, close friends with Ford, also recalled their work together as advocates for those with mental illness. A former president and first ladies present and past joined family members Tuesday afternoon at the first of two services for Ford. It may have been the words of a board member at the alcohol and substance abuse treatment center in Rancho Mirage, California, which bears Ford's name, that most captured her spirit and devotion to others. ""Good afternoon. I'm Geoff. I'm an alcoholic,"" Geoffrey Mason said to mourners at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church, nestled among the arid mountains in Palm Desert, California. Addressing her casket, Mason talked about how Ford encouraged others to peel away sadness, anger and guilt as they regained sobriety. He cited the former first lady's battle with alcohol and painkiller abuse. ""Maybe, just maybe if we worked at it like you told us to, maybe we also could get some relief from the darkness that we had become almost comfortable with."" ""Thank you God for bringing us this extraordinary lady,"" Mason said. ""This brave and inspirational pioneer into our lives."" Among those attending were former President George W. Bush, who escorted former first lady Nancy Reagan to a pew, current first lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Hillary Clinton. A military honor guard escorted Ford's casket, covered by a white shroud bearing a large blue cross. Journalist Cokie Roberts spoke of Ford's service as a political wife when her late husband, President Gerald R. Ford, served in Congress. Roberts said the former first lady asked her to stress in her eulogy the camaraderie once common in Congress. ""That friendship made governing possible,"" Roberts told the mourners. Roberts' father, the late Rep. Hale Boggs, D-Louisiana, served with Gerald Ford, a Republican, in the House. Roberts read from Proverbs 31, a praise of the good wife: ""Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."" Michael Ford spoke of his mother's dancing skills, her love for her husband and her ability to connect with people in their brokenness. Ford's remains will lie in repose at the church until midnight Tuesday, and then be flown Wednesday to the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, according to a website on the memorial plans. Ford's remains will lie in repose there beginning at 7 p.m., said a statement posted on the website. In remarks to reporters Monday, Clinton said she is ""grateful for having known"" Ford. ""Her commitment to speaking out on issues that, before she took them on, were just not discussed made a huge difference in the lives of Americans,"" Clinton said. ""I remember well when my mother's best friend was dying of breast cancer; nobody talked about it in those days,"" she continued. ""But Betty Ford made it acceptable"" to discuss the issue in public. While Clinton, the current secretary of state, was in Palm Desert, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was not at the service because of problems with the aircraft he was to take, said Ford spokeswoman Barbara Lewandrowski. He will attend Thursday's service at Grace Episcopal Church. Former first lady Barbara Bush also will attend.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Soccer Federation will hold a news conference Monday to formally introduce former German skipper Jurgen Klinsmann, 46, as the new coach of the men's national soccer team. Klinsmann's first match will be a highly anticipated August 10 bout with Mexico, which thrashed the U.S. 4-2 in this year's Gold Cup final. He takes over as the team's 35th manager, replacing Bob Bradley who had coached the team since January 2007. Bradley was relieved of his duties Thursday. U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati said he was excited to see Klinsmann taking over. ""He is a highly accomplished player and coach with the experience and knowledge to advance the program,"" Gulati said in a statement last week. ""Jürgen has had success in many different areas of the game and we look forward to the leadership he will provide on and off the field."" Klinsmann's record as a coach is a mixed bag. Though he silenced many of his critics by leading Germany to a third-place trophy in the 2006 World Cup, he stepped down to be with his wife, Debbie, and their two children, who live in California. ""I have a big wish to return to my family and get back to normality,"" he said during a news conference announcing his resignation. In 2008, the Goppingen native took over Bayern Munich, one of Germany's most prestigious club teams, but he was replaced after a year, despite a 25-9-9 record and making the quarterfinals of Europe's Champions League. It was widely reported that he did not see eye-to-eye with Munich's board of directors. It's worth noting that Klinsmann coached American star Landon Donovan during a loan to Munich. Klinsmann told Sports Illustrated's Grant Wahl last year that he believes Donovan ""can play at the highest level"" and thinks the 29-year-old midfielder could have excelled in Germany's Bundesliga had he been given more time. Klinsmann's resume as a player is far more impressive. As a striker, ""the Golden Bomber"" always had a knack for finding the back of the net and amassed 232 goals in 516 games during his 17-year club career. During that time, he played for some of the world's best teams, including Italy's Inter Milan, England's Tottenham Hotspur and Bayern Munich. He also played for the West German national team that won the 1990 World Cup and the German squad that brought home 1996's European Championship. He scored 47 goals in 108 games for his national team. Klinsmann has been considered for the U.S. post in the past, but negotiations crumbled twice over the amount of control Klinsmann would wield in coaching the top American squad. Last year, Klinsmann told Wahl that he passed on the job after the 2006 World Cup but ""left it totally positive."" In a separate interview with SI's soccer guru, Klinsmann said he turned down the job following the 2010 World Cup because the U.S. Soccer Federation wouldn't give him full control of the team in writing. He declined to explain exactly what the federation refused to include. ""That goes too much into specifics,"" Klinsmann told Wahl. ""I don't want to go that far. We couldn't get the deal done because of a couple of issues, and the main issue was we couldn't get it into a written format. And that's it."" Klinsmann will immediately replace Bradley, who was signed to a second four-year contract in August. He had a 45-25-12 record but faced criticism for decisions that observers said led to losses in pivotal games. Included are a 2-1 loss to Ghana in the second round of the 2010 World Cup, and blown 2-0 leads in the 2009 Confederations Cup final against Brazil and the Gold Cup final against Mexico in June.","Klinsmann was tapped a day after U.S. men's coach was fired .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian opposition leader Mehdi Karrubi has not been seen for six weeks and may be facing psychological torture by the government, activists claimed Monday, citing sources in the country. ""We are extremely concerned for the health and well-being of Karrubi, who is 74 years old, and no one has heard from him for six weeks, not his wife, any family or associates,"" said Hadi Ghaemi, the director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. His wife said she had not had any contact with him since July 16, the campaigners said, citing the opposition leader's official website. Ghaemi alleged that Karrubi is ""surrounded by a team of psychiatrists working with his captors"" to try to manipulate him into a televised confession. He cited ""a credible source from inside Iran,"" without saying who it was. An opposition website said February that both Karrubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi, another opposition leader, had been detained. The website, Kaleme, citing ""trusted sources,"" reported that the men and their wives had been arrested and taken to Tehran's Heshmatieh prison. The semi-official Fars news agency denied the report, citing an unnamed judiciary source, but it had earlier said that the government had restricted the movements and communications of both men. The two, who are both former government insiders, both ran for president against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the disputed 2009 election that led to months of protests and a government crackdown on the opposition. Iranian authorities rounded up opponents afresh in February, as revolutions swept the region. Iran media said Monday that that Karrubi was being kept in an unknown location but did not include any comments from Iranian officials. International journalists have been limited in their ability to gather news in Iran, where the government has squelched the media and maintains tight control over state-linked news organizations.","Mehdi Karrubi has not been in contact with his wife since July 16, she says, according to campaigners .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- When you refuse to acknowledge a group of people in all their nuances and complexities, or depict them as predictable and one-dimensional, or dictate for them a code of acceptable behavior, it is a blatant sign of disrespect. It would be offensive for someone to suggest that all Italian-Americans think a certain way, all Irish-Americans behave a certain way or all African-Americans vote a certain way. So it is with 50.5 million Hispanic Americans, who come in every variety imaginable. You might know this from what you consume daily in the form of political messaging, media images and advertising campaigns from Madison Avenue. What better time to assert the right of Hispanics to be unpredictable and complicated human beings than Hispanic Heritage Month, which gives Americans the chance to learn more about, and pay respect to, the nation's largest minority. In 1968, Congress set aside one week each year to honor the contributions and culture of Hispanics. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed legislation expanding the period to 30 days: September 15 to October 15. A generation or two ago, the challenge for Hispanics was simply to get noticed by corporations and political parties. That happened. Ten million votes cast in a presidential election, and roughly $1 trillion in buying power, is hard to ignore. Today, the new challenge is to get those same corporations and political parties to see Hispanics as they really are as opposed to how others want them to be or assume them to be. For example, in the past several weeks, I've been asked often on radio and television interviews to predict where the Hispanic vote will go in the 2012 election. My answer: Just about everywhere. Will Hispanics take a chance on the Republican presidential nominee -- especially if it is Texas Gov. Rick Perry who has a record of attracting Hispanic support to the point of being attacked by Republican rivals who mistakenly cast the immigration debate as ""us"" vs. ""them"" and put Hispanics in the ""them"" camp? Or will they double down by sticking with President Barack Obama who, while earning two-thirds of the Latino vote in 2008, also heads an administration that has repeatedly lied to and manipulated Hispanics by promising immigration reform but delivering only record numbers of deportations -- more than 1 million since Obama took office? My answer: Yes. Both those things will happen. And more. This is not a monolith. The Hispanic population in the United States is made up of conservatives, liberals, middle-of-the-road moderates, Republicans, Democrats, independents and everything in-between. It's true that most Hispanics are registered Democrats, just like they have been for the past five decades dating back to the ""Viva Kennedy"" clubs in 1960. But it is also true that Hispanics have -- in gubernatorial, congressional and presidential races over the years -- been willing to cross party lines and support moderate Republicans who eschew anti-Hispanic nativism and craft a message that appeals to them. You see that sort of thing much more often at the local and state level than you do in the federal arena. But it happens everywhere. The list of Republicans who enjoyed significant Hispanic support in their political careers is long and distinguished. It includes George W. Bush, John McCain, Jeb Bush, Rudolph Giuliani, Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and two former Arizona governors -- Fife Symington and Jane Hull. Of course, among Hispanics, there are differences in geography, economic status and educational attainment that help shape how they see the world and their place in it. There are also ancestral differences. According to the 2010 census, about two-thirds of those 50.5 million people are Mexican or Mexican-American. The other third is made up of Puerto Ricans, Cuban-Americans, Salvadorans, Brazilians, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Colombians, Venezuelans and others. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American and self-described ""son of exiles"" who is being talked about as possibly landing on the 2012 Republican presidential ticket, is the darling of South Florida. Yet, if Rubio were on the GOP ticket, he is likely to be very unpopular in the Southwest where many Mexican-Americans resent Rubio's hard line on illegal immigration. It's easy to talk tough about border security or oppose ""amnesty"" when you represent a community in which came here on the red carpet of the Cuban Adjustment Act, a relic of the Cold War that makes it almost impossible to remove Cuban immigrants once they arrive on these shores. But besides those differences, there are also similarities. Regardless of their backgrounds or biographies or biases, Hispanics want what the rest of their countrymen want: The chance to work for a brighter tomorrow, the right blend of rights and responsibilities and the respect that comes from being seen as individuals and not just part of a group. And why not? That's the American way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: Don't stereotype Hispanic Americans .

"(CNN) -- A top international Red Cross official will be meeting with Syrian leaders over the next two days to discuss ""urgent humanitarian challenges"" in the conflict-wracked nation and permission to visit detainees amid stark reports of prisoner abuse. Jakob Kellenberger, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, was to arrive in Damascus on Saturday for a two-day visit, the ICRC said. He will meet with President Bashar al-Assad, Prime Minister Adel Safar, Walid Muallem, the minister of foreign affairs and expatriates, and the Syrian Red Crescent, the ICRC said. This comes as Syria remains engulfed in nearly six months of public protest, and the regime has been reviled internationally for its crackdown on peaceful demonstrators, which has led to more than 2,000 deaths and thousands of arrests. When Kellenberger visited Syrian officials in June, he reached an understanding that would give the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent ""enhanced access to areas of unrest, and negotiations would take place concerning ICRC visits to detainees."" ""The purpose of the talks to be held in the Syrian capital today and tomorrow is to review progress made in both these areas,"" the ICRC said. ""The ICRC president's visit will also offer an opportunity to discuss the impending start of ICRC visits to persons detained by the Ministry of the Interior. The ICRC visits detainees in order to assess the conditions in which they are being held and the treatment they receive."" This visit comes on the heels of an Amnesty International report detailing the deaths of at least 88 people in detention and widespread abuse of prisoners. Another issue to be addressed is access to medical care for the sick and wounded. There have been reports of people not being able to access medical care during security operations. Elsewhere in Syria, two people were killed on Saturday in Habash, a village in northwestern Idlib province, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group. This occurred as security and military personnel stormed the city in search of wanted militants, the group said. The latest international pressure on the Syrian regime was Friday, when the European Union banned the import of Syrian oil and added four more Syrians and three entities to a list of those targeted by an asset freeze and a travel ban. Russia's foreign minister slammed the EU sanctions against Syria, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported Saturday. ""We've always said that unilateral sanctions will bring no good. It destroys the partnership approach to any crisis,"" Sergei Lavrov said.","The ICRC president will meet with Bashar al-Assad and others .

"(CNN) -- In the middle of the massive effort to protect New Yorkers from the effects of Hurricane Irene last month, a colorful moment gave people an amusing opportunity to laugh and joke. It was New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to communicate with Spanish-speaking New Yorkers in their own language. ""My Spanish skills, may continue poco a poco (little by little),"" said the mayor in not-so-fluent Spanish on Aug. 30 when asked by reporters about his repeated attempts to communicate in Spanish. Bloomberg never explained whether his speaking Spanish was out of a genuine concern to effectively communicate with people or a way to score political points with New York's Hispanic voters â€” or both. The New York mayor is not alone. The relatively recent trend of politicians trying to communicate in Spanish also includes President Barack Obama. Back in June, he became the first president in 50 years to make an official visit to Puerto Rico. He started his speech by greeting his supporters in Spanish. ""Buenas tardes (good afternoon)"" said the president to hundreds of his supporters who seemed excited to hear Obama rolling the ""R."" Puerto Ricans have surpassed Cubans as the largest Latino group of voters in Florida, a swing state expected to be highly contested once again in 2012. Some Republican presidential candidates also seem to be courting Hispanics. On Sept. 2, Mitt Romney attended a breakfast sponsored by the Republican National Hispanic Assembly in Tampa, Florida. About 100 Hispanic leaders from across the country heard Romney's speech. The former Massachusetts governor didn't try to roll any Rs, but paid close attention to the issue of how much the economic downturn has hit Latinos. ""Hispanics, as you know, have been hit terribly hard, disproportionately hard with an unemployment rate that is substantially higher than the national figures,"" Romney said. Experts say appealing to the fastest-growing ethnic group in the country is crucial the year before presidential elections. Mark Lopez, associate director at the Pew Hispanic Center, says that ""Latinos have played a growing and important role in the nation's presidential elections over the last few election cycles. There are now more than 21 million Hispanics who are eligible to vote and Latinos reside in some key states."" According to the U.S. Census, in the 2008 presidential election, Latinos represented 13 percent of all voters in Colorado, 14 percent in Nevada, 15 percent in Florida, and 38 percent in New Mexico. Those four states will likely be swing states again in 2012. ""Even the participation rate among Hispanics in presidential elections has been growing [in those states],"" says Lopez. In 2008, 9.5 million of the nation's 12 million registered Latino voters went to the polls. Juan Andrade, president of the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute, an organization that tracks Latino voting trends, says he's expecting a dramatic increase next year. ""Our estimate is that we will probably have at least 12 to 13 million registered to vote in the next presidential election. It could be even higher,"" Andrade says. In 2004, former President George W. Bush won more than 40 percent of the Latino vote. Four years later, 67 percent of Hispanic voters went for Obama. Experts say anybody getting that kind of support from Latinos next year, whether Democrat or Republican, has a good chance of winning the presidency. ""The Latino vote can prove decisive and we have demonstrated the ability to swing critical states again like we did in 2008,"" says Andrade. Still, Andrade cautions that it's still too early to determine what the Latino voter behavior will be in 2012, and whether the enthusiasm of 2008 is going to be there again. ""Are we going to continue to increase in voter registration and voter turnout as we have in every consecutive presidential election over the last 30 years? It remains to be seen,"" says Andrade. According to the most recent U.S. Census figures, there are currently 50.5 million people of Hispanic origin in the United States, which represents 16.3 percent of the total population.","Politicians off all stripes are appealing to Hispanic voters .
In 2004, Bush won more than 40 percent of the Latino vote .

"New York (CNN) -- A former on-air meteorologist for New York's WABC-TV has pleaded guilty to charges of filing a phony attempted sexual assault report, a story she later recanted. Heidi Jones pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of false reporting in the third degree, her attorney, Paul Callan, said Wednesday. Jones, who did weather reports on the station's weekend newscasts, called police on November 24, 2010, saying that she had nearly been attacked while jogging in Central Park. She said that on November 21 she had crossed paths with a man, whom she described as a Hispanic in his 30s, who taunted and harassed her. Police said Jones later recanted the story as police questioned her. After she was arrested and charged in December, she was suspended by WABC and later resigned. Before Wednesday's guilty plea, Callan filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that Jones was denied her right to a speedy trial. State Supreme Court Justice Richard Carruthers denied the motion. While sentencing is scheduled for October 26, the defendant and the district attorney's office said they have agreed on a sentence of three years probation with 350 hours of community service. Assistant District Attorney Shanda Strain said in court that the number of hours of community service was based on the number of hours law enforcement officials spent investigating the case, said Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. Callan said that Jones ""wished to express her sincere apologies for any problems caused by her and by this incident and she specifically apologized to the NYPD and other law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation."" He added, ""Heidi Jones has always sought a way to accept personal responsibility for the unfortunate actions"" CNN's Jesse Solomon contributed to this report.","Heidi Jones pleads guilty to two misdemeanor counts .

"(CNN) -- Iran's foreign minister says he backs Syria's president but that the embattled Bashar al-Assad must pay heed to his citizenry's demands amid the country's instability, an Iranian news outlet reported on Saturday. Semi-official Iranian Students News Agency quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi as saying that Syria should be more cautious and patient in its dealings with the citizenry. Iran has been a top ally of Syria. The foreign minister warned of the consequences of a power vacuum amid the five-month-long protests in the Arab country. Syria's regime has come under criticism and pressure for its harsh crackdown on demonstrators and world powers have called for al-Assad to step down. As a result of the tumult, Iran is concerned about the effects of the instability on the region and exploitation of the unrest by other countries. ""We take one single position on Middle East and North African countries' popular developments. We believe developments in regional countries came following discontent of their nations,"" Salehi told ISNA. ""Regional governments should be vigilant about foreigners' meddling in their internal affairs. Current interference of foreigners in internal affairs of some regional countries, particularly in Syria, is clear-cut to everyone."" Salehi insisted that al-Assad should be supported and that ""changing the regime in Syria is unconventional and is followed by an evil purpose."" Meanwhile at least one person was killed in the suburban Damascus town of Saqba after protests broke out on Saturday, said Rami Abdul Rahman, the head of Human Rights Observatory in Syria, an activist group. Abdul Rahman said scores of people were arrested in raids Saturday night as protesters tried to get to Damascus. He said snipers have been deployed on the rooftops and security forces have a heavy presence on streets. Reports of state-run news agency reporters on Saturday denied there were demonstrations in Damascus-area regions, despite news reports from Arabic-language networks. The Syrian Arab News Agency report said Al-Jazeera and Al Arabiya once again proved ""to be part of the conspiracy plotted against Syria through their psychological and media war strategies.""","Iran's foreign minister warns of a power vacuum .

"(CNN) -- Olympic champion Michael Phelps admitted it was good to be back on the winning trail after securing his first gold medal at the World Swimming Championships in Shanghai. Defending champion Phelps, from the United States, came first in the men's 200 meters butterfly a day after he was pipped to gold in the 200m freestyle by compatriot Ryan Lochte. He won in a time of one minute 53.34 seconds to beat Japan's Takeshi Matsuda, who had led with 50m to go, into second while China's Wu Peng claimed the bronze medal. Phelps, a 14-time Olympic gold medal winner, has had a disappointing year but said he was relieved to pick up his first gold in China and now wanted to embark on a lengthy unbeaten run. ""A lot of it is being fitter but also I didn't want to lose that race again,"" he told reporters. ""Having a number of defeats this year is extremely frustrating for me and I didn't like the feeling. ""So I kind of wanted to have the feeling of winning a race again. It feels good to win a race. It doesn't matter what it is so I dug as deep as I could that last 50, just tried to finish as strong as I could. ""I knew (bronze medallist) Wu Peng was finishing very well, he finished very well yesterday and Takeshi has always been there at the end. I kind of tried to put it into the biggest over-gear I could put it in and just get to the wall."" Phelps won a record-breaking haul of eight gold's at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 but had suffered a run of defeats leading into the World Championships. Despite landing his first gold in Shanghai, and swimming quicker than last year, he says there is still more to come. ""I'm super-happy with swimming faster than I did last year, close to a second-and-a-half but I still want more in that event and I want to be faster. I think that was a little too close for my comfort,"" he added. Phelps will go head-to-head with Lochte again on Thursday as they do battle in the 200m individual medley final. Elsewhere, Federica Pellegrini, from Italy, regained her women's 200m freestyle crown and in the process made history as the first female to win both the 200m and 400m freestyle at consecutive World Championships. The men's 50m breaststroke title went to Brazil's Felipe Franca da Silva, who pipped Italy's Fabio Scozzoli and defending champion Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa to the line. And China took another gold as Sun Yang won the men's 800m freestyle title, beating Canada's Ryan Cochrane into second. Hungary's Gergo Kis took bronze.","Michael Phelps wins his first gold medal of the World Swimming Championships .

"(CNN) -- Freestyle skier Jeret ""Speedy"" Peterson, who won a silver medal at the 2010 Winter Games, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police in Utah said Tuesday. The Unified Police Department of Greater Salt Lake responded to a 911 call from Peterson, 29, Monday night, said Lt. Justin Hoyal. Peterson told police he was going to take his life and said he was in Lambs Canyon, between Salt Lake City and Park City, Hoyal told CNN. Officers found him deceased there at about 11:30 p.m., he said. Peterson told an CNN iReporter in Vancouver, Canada, the cheers he received when receiving the silver medal in men's aerials ""was one of the coolest feelings in the world."" He had competed in two previous Winter Games. According to a biography on the United States Ski and Snowboard Association website, Peterson picked up the nickname ""Speedy"" at a summer ski camp in Lake Placid, New York, in the mid-1990s because coaches thought he resembled the cartoon character ""Speed Racer"" with a big helmet. He won the 1999 U.S. Junior Championship and took bronze at two straight World Junior Championships in 2000 and 2001. His signature jump was called the ""Hurricane,"" which he failed to land in Torino, Italy, during the 2006 Winter Games, dropping him from third to seventh. The next day, Peterson was sent home after a post-party fight, according to the biography. Members of the U.S. Olympic Committee mourned Peterson's passing. ""I know Speedy's friends and family were incredibly proud of his effort in Vancouver, and his achievements were an inspiration to people all over the world,"" said committee chief executive Scott Blackmun. ""The personal challenges Speedy has battled are familiar to all of us, and on behalf of the U.S. Olympic Committee, I'd like to offer my sympathy to Speedy's family and friends.

"(CNN)  -- Fantasy role-playing takes a staggering step forward as ""Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale"" lurches along with uneven visuals and spotty artificial intelligence but a combat system that is easy to learn and even easier to use. The first D&D electronic game (Bedlam Games, Atari) that features use of the new Fourth Edition rules from Wizards of the Coast, ""Daggerdale"" allows players to create and develop a character from first level, much like the classic tabletop version of D&D. Ability scores, hit points, attack and damage rolls are all part of making up your character, but without the use of any dice. There are four base characters: male human fighter, male dwarven cleric, female elven rogue and male halfling wizard. You cannot mix and match: no female elven fighters or male human rogues. Each race and class has its own bonuses and class abilities to help perform their actions. The adventure begins in a dwarven mine overrun by goblins. As with any D&D campaign, the story builds from there into a rousing battle with a major enemy at the end. There are major quests that help move the main plot along and minor quests that offer opportunities to earn more gold and experience points. Experience points are the backbone of character development, allowing for increased abilities, powers and weapons. Only one quest can be tackled at a time. Once you start one, you need to complete that mission before moving on to the next. This often results in a lot of back and forth through some of the same areas. Gold and weapons can be gathered from fallen enemies or from barrels that seem to be everywhere and in every setting. Improved weapons, armor, rings, amulets and potions can also be purchased from local merchants. Sounds like a typical D&D game, right? Visually, the game conveys the fantasy setting well. The dwarven mine appears foreboding but doesn't quite reach the creepy darkness it could have. A jail also is well-lit when it could have been a better mood-setter with some lighting adjustments. A mini-map in the upper right-hand corner was very helpful in pointing to merchants, non-player characters who might send you on quests and the locations of those quests. A larger map was easily accessible using the character menu. Player characters appear different as they don different armor and hold different weapons. Enemies look unique from type to type (e.g., a minion looks different from a controller) and can be readily identified by appearance alone. Each enemy has a small box above its head that lists out what it is, what level of power it possesses, how many hit points it has and other information. Of course, in a traditional tabletop D&D game, these things would be hidden so players wouldn't be able to target weaker foes first in order to whittle down the opposing forces. The information box would sometimes appear if the enemy were hidden around a corner, thus ruining any surprise that could have occurred. There were also instances in which there would be an info box but no enemy. Enemy artificial-intelligence was also hit and miss. Although the overall tactics of groups of enemies was good (minions charged as their archers and magic-users pinged from afar), they would also stand in place as I lobbed fireball after fireball at them. Those battles were less than epic. However, combat was pretty good all in all, and that's where I thought the game shined over its table-top counterpart. I played through the single-player campaign as the halfling wizard, and switching from normal weapons to spells was incredibly easy. All four buttons on the controller can be mapped directly to weapons, spells or potions. There are four more locations that can be used by pressing the left trigger button (Xbox 360) or the L2 button (PS3) and then utilizing the standard buttons. Spells had cool-down times after casting, so you could either stand there and get pounded or find another way to attack as you powered back up. As I increased in levels, more spells became available so I could fire off spell after spell in a cycle. Action was quick and intense. Battles didn't last very long against weaker opponents and were appropriately longer against stronger opponents. There are some ""boss"" battles before the final conflict, and those required some use of tactics (run-and-gun) to be successful. My biggest gripe about the game has to do with when those tactics fail and you die. In single-player mode, there are healing potions you can carry with you to regain hit points. There are also clerics in the settlements who will heal you for free. However, there are occasions during a quest when an enemy gets some really good hits in, and, in the heat of battle, you lose track of your hit points, and you die. Here is the gripe: No matter what stage you are at in the quest, you have to restart it from the beginning. There are no checkpoints during the quest. There are no ""save and reload"" points other than in between quests. Although this is very much like the table-top version of the game (dead is dead, after all), it was insanely frustrating from a video-gaming standpoint. On more than one occasion, I completed a rather lengthy fight, defeated multiple big bad guys and got killed on the way back to the quest-giver (having forgotten to heal myself on the way). This was particularly maddening during the climactic battle, in which you have to defeat multiple high-level characters in rapid succession. Get through some but lose in the last one? Too bad. If playing with a party of characters is more your speed, there is a co-op mode that allows for up to four players to combine talents toward the common good. The enemies are stronger, and the loot gets better with more people. Completing the game's main quests can be done in less than four hours (a good length for a D&D campaign), but doing all the side quests will add some time to your play. Overall, ""Daggerdale"" was enjoyable but a bit buggy. The story and combat were good and made for an exciting experience. The spotty visuals and enemy AI weighted down the overall fun, but not enough to make me want to stop playing. Is it good enough to live up to the D&D name? Depends on how much actual roleplaying you like to do. There is little to none to be had here. Interactions with other non-player characters happen largely in grunts and subtitles. No dialogue exists other than during cut-scene cinematics. It won't replace your tabletop game, but it might give you some good ideas how to run your next campaign while allowing you some enjoyment along the way. ""Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale"" is available now on the PC and through the Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network. It is rated T for Teen.

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina woman will serve at least 14 years in prison after pleading guilty Thursday to second-degree murder in the death last year of her 10-year-old stepdaughter. As part of a plea agreement, Elisa Baker admitted killing Zahra Baker and attempting to thwart investigators by planting a fake ransom note at the family's Hickory, North Carolina, home in October 2010. Zahra's body was dismembered and some of the remains were found a month later. The freckle-faced girl's disappearance and search drew national attention. Zahra had lost part of her left leg at age 5 and lost hearing in both her ears while undergoing treatment for cancer. Dressed in a pink jail jumpsuit, Baker answered Judge Timothy Kincaid's questions in a soft voice during her plea hearing Thursday. Kincaid advised her that she will face between 14 years, nine months, and 18 years, six months in prison. Kincaid had already agreed to move Baker's murder trial out of Catawba County because of pretrial publicity in the case. The judge was supposed to announce Monday where the trial would be held, according to CNN affiliate WCNC, but that hearing was put on hold because of the pending plea deal. Baker also pleaded guilty to charges of obstruction of justice, bigamy, obtaining property by false pretenses and identity fraud. In the plea agreement she signed, and also under questioning Thursday, Baker admitted to several aggravating factors in the case, including ""a history and pattern of physical, verbal and psychological abuse of the victim."" Moreover, Baker said she ""secreted the victim from family and others"" and ""desecrated the victim's body to hinder detection,"" hampering the police investigation as a result. She also accepted statutory aggravating factors, namely that ""the victim was very young, physically infirm or handicapped"" and that ""the defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence ... to commit the offense."" A call placed Thursday to Baker's court-appointed attorney was not immediately returned. District Attorney James Gaither Jr., whose district includes Burke, Caldwell and Catawba counties, told CNN he ""absolutely"" feels that justice was served, while adding that he wished ""the law and the facts were more favorable to the state."" Gaither said it was unexpected when Elisa Baker chose to cooperate with authorities on a case that caused ""confusion and outrage and real frustration"" in the North Carolina community. In a statement, he said that he agreed to the plea deal to avoid ""the risk ... that Elisa Baker would avoid responsibility for her part in the death of Zahra."" ""The probability was that without her cooperation, law enforcement would not locate Zahra's body,"" Gaither said. ""The probability of a successful prosecution for first-degree murder was likewise very unlikely."" The district attorney said he had consulted with Emily Dietrich, the late girl's biological mother who lives in Australia. He said she was ""pleased and satisfied"" with the case's conclusion. Court documents in the case show that Baker told authorities Zahra was killed two weeks before she was reported missing. Authorities found the fake ransom note at the home. One criminal investigator testified at Thursday's hearing that Baker told authorities she found Zahra not breathing on September 24, 2010, according to WCNC. Investigations have no ""credible evidence"" to suggest that anyone other than Elisa Baker was involved in Zahra's death, Gaither said in February. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: The DA says justice ""absolutely"" was served in this case with the plea deal .

"Bellevue, Washington (CNN) -- Just a year before turning 40, Judy Haley was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer that required an immediate mastectomy. The procedure and the treatments that followed left her fatigued, nauseated and in so much pain that she couldn't pick up her 1-year-old daughter or do simple household chores. She also struggled with depression because she needed constant child-care assistance. ""It's really hard to ask for help,"" Haley recalled. ""You want to be competent and independent. ... And then, all of a sudden, you have to acknowledge the fact that you can't take care of your daughter all by yourself."" Haley and her husband were both full-time students, so there were also financial concerns. The couple cashed in their retirement to deal with the crush of medical bills. ""I was really bottoming out emotionally,"" Haley said. That's when a friend recommended that she reach out to the Pink Daisy Project, a nonprofit that provides support to breast cancer patients under 45. Since 2008, the Pink Daisy Project has helped more than 150 women -- mostly in the form of house-cleaning assistance and gift cards for gas, groceries and restaurants. But according to Haley, it's so much more. ""It's hope,"" she said. ""Right when I would hit the (emotional) low, there was a gift card ... or the toilet was 'magically' clean. I can't overemphasize the value of that to somebody with cancer."" The founder of the Pink Daisy Project, Debbie Cantwell, can relate to Haley's plight. She was 41 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. ""I could not even wrap my head around it,"" Cantwell said. ""You're relatively healthy, and they tell you (that) you have a chance of dying. ... It just throws your world upside down."" Cantwell underwent surgery to remove both breasts and 20 lymph nodes. She received eight rounds of chemotherapy and 37 radiation treatments before undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. She blistered, bled, lost all her hair and continued to work full-time as a copywriter and the sole provider for her husband and two young children. Throughout her treatment, however, Cantwell was supported by family, friends and co-workers who pitched in to help her with her daily responsibilities. Co-workers donated vacation and sick leave. Friends brought over meals and took on child-care duties. Relatives helped with mounting costs. ""I just felt so grateful that all these people in my life were there for me and made it manageable,"" she said. ""Once I was through with treatment, I couldn't possibly pay everybody back. So I decided I was going to pay it forward."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Through her ordeal, Cantwell met other young breast cancer patients who were struggling through their treatment but lacked the kind of support that she had. She found that many breast cancer foundations exist primarily to raise awareness and funding for research and treatment, not to offset the daily stress on patients' lives. ""I'm all for research; I hope my daughter never has to go through this,"" Cantwell said. ""But the Pink Daisy Project's biggest concern is helping the (young) women that can't wait for a cure. ... They're sick right now, and they need help today."" Cantwell fields grant requests through her website. The grants average $400 in value and are designed to cover a woman's basic needs for about one month, but Cantwell will customize the level and type of support based on need and available resources. The money comes from small fundraisers and personal donations. ""Right now, the Pink Daisy Project is helping women in these small ways,"" Cantwell said. ""But eventually, I want to be able to help in larger ways with real practical, tangible things like helping with bills ... helping with the rent, helping with medical payments. It's so hard to focus on healing when you've got $12,000 in medical bills."" The average age of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States is 61. But according to the Young Survival Coalition, there are more than 250,000 women living in the U.S. who were 40 or younger when diagnosed. ""I think it's harder when you're younger,"" Cantwell said, ""because you're a mom, or you're a college student, or you're working. You normally felt really good. And suddenly, you feel terrible all the time."" Cantwell said older women also tend to have a larger support system. ""Older women sometimes have grown children to help or a retired husband, or their friends don't work,"" she said. ""Plus, there's a lot of senior services and Medicaid and disability and Social Security that, younger women, we often just don't have."" In addition to providing young breast cancer patients with immediate assistance, the Pink Daisy Project has built an online community that connects them and offers emotional support during what can be a potentially isolating time. ""I feel like they're my sisters, and I just want to do whatever I can to help them,"" Cantwell said. ""I cry a lot. I always light a candle when I lose somebody I've helped. ... It's unbelievable and heart-wrenching, but it's just part of the job. ... ""I'll probably die of breast cancer someday. But I don't feel sorry for myself. I never have. I want to really make the most of the time I have by doing some good in the world. ... And if the spirit of helping each other were to continue, I'd feel my efforts meant something.""

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods' return to golf proved to be short-lived when the former world No. 1 pulled out of the prestigious Players Championship after only nine holes of Thursday's opening round. The American was making his comeback after suffering knee and Achilles injuries during the Masters at Augusta last month, but those problems recurred from his first shot at Sawgrass. The 35-year-old, trying to win his first tournament since the scandal over his extra-marital affairs broke in late 2009, sent his tee drive wide of the fairway and bogeyed the hole. He dropped three more shots at the fourth hole and another at the fifth, and walked off the course in Florida's Ponte Vedra Beach after a bogey at nine left him six over the card. Injured Woods faces 'weeks' on sidelines . ""The knee acted up and then the Achilles followed after that and then the calf started cramping up. Everything started getting tight, so it's just a whole chain reaction,"" Woods told the PGA Tour's website. ""This morning I felt fine during the warm-up, and then as I played, it progressively got worse."" Woods had been confident after playing nine holes on Tuesday, his first on-course action since finishing fourth at Augusta. ""Oh yeah, the knee is much better, no doubt. The Achilles is better as well. So I'm here playing,"" he said after that practice effort. Woods also pulled out of the $9.5 million tournament last year in the final round, due to a neck injury. He won it for the first and only time in 2001. The Players Championship is the most lucrative on the PGA Tour and is often referred to as golf's ""fifth major"" outside the Masters, the U.S. and British Opens and the PGA Championship. The continuing injury problems mean Woods is battling to be fit for the second major this season, the U.S. Open at Congressional Country Club in Maryland from June 13-19. He has been revamping his swing under the tutelage of coach Sean Foley, but is still having problems with the same left knee that required surgery after he seriously injured it during his triumph at the 2008 U.S. Open. Meanwhile, Nick Watney claimed a one-shot lead at the Players Championship, shooting eight-under-par 64 in his opening round on Thursday. The 30-year-old American, seeking his second title this year and fourth PGA success overall, birdied his first three holes after starting at the 10th tee then gave back two shots at the par-four 14th. He immediately bounced back with another birdie, then an eagle three at the second preceded a run of four birdies in five holes before he bogeyed at his penultimate green. However, his ninth birdie at the last gave Watney a slim advantage over compatriot Lucas Glover, who won the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow on Sunday. Veteran Mark O'Meara shared third place with fellow American David Toms after both shot 66, while world No. 2 Martin Kaymer was tied for fifth on 67 with U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell, South Africa's Rory Sabbatini and Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson. World No. 3 Luke Donald was in a big group tied for 13th on 69, while fourth-ranked Phil Mickelson was back in 44th after a 71.","Tiger Woods withdraws from Players Championship after only nine holes .

"(CNN) -- Olympic marathon gold medalist Samuel Wanjiru died early Monday from injuries sustained after jumping from the balcony of his Nyahururu home in central Kenya, a senior police official said. Wanjiru jumped from the second-floor of his home late Sunday after his wife caught him in the company of another woman, said Jasper Ompati, a police official in Nyahururu. Wanjiru's wife, Tereza Njeri, and another woman were taken to the police station to give statements but were not considered suspects, Ompati said. The death remains under investigation, he said. Njeri, who lives in Nairobi, returned home unexpectedly to find the two together, Ompati said. Wanjiru is believed to have jumped after his wife locked him inside a bedroom on the second floor, making it impossible for him to leave, he said. Wanjiru achieved worldwide fame when he became Kenya's first Olympic marathon champion at the Beijing Games in 2008. Kenyans were mourning the death of Wanjiru, who was considered a national hero. Hundreds were lining up to view his body at a Nyahururu funeral home. Athletics Kenya, the governing athletic body, said the country lost a great athlete. The association said it had pinned its hopes on Wanjiru to win another medal at the London Olympics in 2012. ""He's left a gap that will be hard to fill,"" said David Okeyo, the secretary-general of Athletics Kenya. The International Olympic Committee praised Wanjiru as an accomplished runner who will be remembered for winning his country's first Olympic gold medal in the marathon and setting a new Olympic record in the process. ""Our thoughts are with his family and friends,"" the IOC said in a written statement sent to CNN. At 21, Wanjiru was the youngest gold medal winner in the marathon at an Olympics since 1932. After his Beijing triumph, Wanjiru has set about dominating the marathon distance, claiming a number of victories in races. It helped him be crowned the men's champion in the 2009 and 2010 world marathon majors series. In recent years, Wanjiru has had a number of troubles. In December 2010, Wanjiru was charged with making death threats against his wife and illegally possessing an AK47 rifle. At the time, prosecutors alleged Wanjiru was drunk when he made the threats. Wanjiru pleaded innocent to the charges during a court appearance in his home town of Nyahururu. His wife later dropped the charges, though he still faced a weapons charge. Wanjiru was forced to withdraw from the London Marathon, a premier running event ahead of the 2012 Olympics, after he was involved in an automobile accident in January in Kenya. Journalist Lillian Leposo contributed to this story.","NEW: International Olympic Committee praises Wanjiru as an accomplished runner .

"(CNN) -- One by one, disasters have battered the Deep South in recent years: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, horrific tornado outbreaks, the Gulf oil spill and now a flood of biblical proportions on the Mississippi River. It's as if Old Testament punishments have befallen the bayous, deltas and savannahs of a region that's already scourged with staggering poverty. ""We're waiting for the locusts,"" commented Kim Fritz, interim executive director of the Mississippi Casino Operators Association. ""At a certain point, you have to go: 'What else?' "" Within her group alone, the economic punch of this month's expanding flood has put 10,000 hourly employees temporarily out of work at 16 shuttered casinos along the river, Fritz said. Open Story: Damage map . ""All kidding aside,"" she said, ""it's been pretty tough in this area over the past few years, but we just get up and keep going."" Up and down the magnificent Mississippi, tales of hardship -- and at least one case of good fortune -- are emerging as the river is rising. Flooding and other disasters are nothing new to the crawfishermen, casino workers, hotel housekeepers, barge skippers, watermen and other working-class individuals who make their living from the Mississippi and the Gulf. But so many problems coming so closely together are taking a toll. ""What can we do to catch a break?"" asked Wayne Mansfield, director of the Warren County Port Commission and the Warren County Economic Development Foundation, based in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Floodwaters on rise in Mississippi, Louisiana . The 600-acre facility, the nation's 11th-busiest inland port moving as many as 14 million tons of bulk material a year, is closed because of flooding, bringing business to a halt, he said. ""Vicksburg's and Warren County's economy has long been tied to the river, for 150 years or more,"" Mansfield said. ""Because of fuel prices ... we had seen an increase in barge activity, but the problem now is the barges have nowhere to dock because the docks are underwater."" It's not just riverbank commerce that has been paralyzed, Mansfield said. Inland flooding of roads has also forced many businesses to shut down, including 1,200 jobs at a paper mill and a manufacturer of shallow-water oil rigs, Mansfield said. ""You know, the one thing about Mississippi and Mississippians, we are truly a resilient people,"" Mansfield said. ""After the event is over, we will rely once again on the river for our recovery."" What does cresting mean? If there's a welcome surprise in the slow-moving disaster that's the great Mississippi River flood of 2011, it's that the crawfish are now running heavy, said craw fisherman Jody Meche, 41, of Henderson, Louisiana. Crawdads are so big in this part of the country that Louisiana accounts for 98% of the country's production, according to the Louisiana Crawfish Farmers Association. Meche has been exposed to crawfishing all his life, starting with his father. His dad was born on a house boat on a bay of the Atchafalaya Basin, home to the nation's largest river swamp and part of the Mississippi River watershed. The basin is among the most culturally rich and ecologically varied regions in the country, and it's home to the Cajun culture. With a thick accent steeped in the region, Meche considers himself a Cajun and speaks a little French though he can't keep up with the old timers, he said. Meche has been fishing for crawdads for 21 years, a skill he learned from his fisherman father, he said. For now, the flood has pushed so much water -- and oxygen -- down the river that crawfish are growing fast and eating well, Meche said. That translates to a good catch in his traps. But the rising waters have forced Meche to string the crawfish traps to higher tree branches, he said. So he has to motor his 19-foot skiff closer to the tall branches and stand atop the catwalk on his boat to tether the traps to the tall trees among the flooded banks, he said. It's worth the extra work, he said. He's now harvesting 50 to 60 sacks a day of crawfish, or 700 to 1,000 pounds, he said. ""The crawfish is going to run heavy, but it's a hectic situation,"" said Meche, who's also vice president of the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association West, which has 400 to 500 members. ""We have to cut a lot of the branches and the trees. You have to add strings to the cages, and with every day the water rises, you have to raise the strings higher in the tree."" If this pace continues, he can meet the typical annual income of $30,000 to $50,000, minus up to 35% in expenses such as bait, gas and motor parts, he said. ""You see, we're like farmers,"" Meche said. ""You got to make hay while the sun is shining."" The flood does pose one big threat to him and other craw fishermen. If the water breaches the levees and floods roads, markets will close and trucks won't be able to transport the bounty to consumers, he said. ""We're keeping our fingers crossed that it's going to stay within the levees,"" Meche said. ""And that's going to be a real big if."" How the Mississippi River levees could fail . The other peril facing the fishermen is old timber. Past hurricanes such as Gustav in 2008 felled many trees along the river, and the timber has since been lodged along the banks, said Stephen Minvielle, director of the Louisiana Crawfish Farmers Association. The flooding Mississippi will likely dislodge a lot of that wood, and ""it's going to act as 10,000-pound battering rams floating down the river,"" Minvielle said. Meche, a tough Cajun who skins farm alligators in the off-season, said he's prepared for all seasons, come what may. ""The craw fishermen, we're hard working people,"" Meche said. ""We're a resilient people. We're not lazy people, you know what I'm saying.""","The Deep South has been pummeled by big disasters caused by nature and man .
This month's flooding on the Mississippi River has rendered many residents jobless .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- A human rights group on Saturday urged Iranian authorities not to put acid in the eyes of a man found guilty of blinding a woman who scorned him. Majid Movahedi is scheduled to be blinded by having five drops of acid in each eye Saturday, according to Amnesty International. It was unclear what time -- or whether -- the punishment will take place Saturday. The semiofficial Iranian Students' News Agency, or ISNA, reported Saturday that the acid punishment had been postponed and another date hadn't been established. Movahedi was convicted in 2008 of throwing a bucket of acid on Ameneh Bahrami. The attack blinded Bahrami, who sought to have authorities render the ancient punishment of ""an eye for an eye"" in accordance with Islamic law. The rights group is urging Iran to forgo the acid punishment. ""It is unbelievable that the Iranian authorities would consider implementing such a punishment,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, an Amnesty International deputy director. ""Regardless of how horrific the crime suffered by Ameneh Bahrami, being blinded with acid is a cruel and inhuman punishment amounting to torture, and the Iranian authorities have a responsibility under international law to ensure it does not go ahead."" Bahrami said it has been very difficult for her since the attack. She says she first met Movahedi in 2002 when they attended the same school. She was a 24-year-old electronics student. He was 19. She never noticed him until he sat next to her in class and brushed up against her. Bahrami says she knew it wasn't an accident. ""I moved away from him,"" she said, ""but he brushed up against me again."" Bahrami said that over the next two years, Movahedi harassed her and made threats, even asking her to marry him. ""He told me he would kill me. He said, 'You have to say yes.' "" On a November afternoon in 2004, his threats turned to violence when he followed her from the medical engineering company where she worked. As she walked to the bus stop, she sensed someone behind her. She turned around and was startled to see Movahedi, who threw something over her. What felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin. ""I was just yelling, 'I'm burning! I'm burning! For God's sake, somebody help me,' "" she said. The acid seeped into her eyes, and streamed down her face into her mouth. When she covered her face with her hands, streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms. In 2009, Bahrami told CNN that she had undergone more than a dozen surgeries on her badly scarred face, but still imagined that in the future she would have a wedding day. ""I always see myself as someone who can see and sometimes see myself in a beautiful wedding gown, and why not?"" She said.

"Reno, Nevada (CNN) -- A man who once appeared discreetly as a stunt pilot in movies became the center of national attention after a crash at a Nevada air show. Jimmy Leeward is presumed dead after the Friday crash. The 74-year-old owned Leeward Ranch, a pilot community in Ocala, Florida. The 500-acre gated community features plane enthusiasts who build custom homes on lots that include hangars. The community has a runway so that people can fly from their homes. ""The vision was to have a variety of great airplanes, a variety of great pilots,"" Leeward said in a documentary about his ranch. ""And a place where everybody could really have a lot of fun. I wanted that as part of my vision to be something that was just like my father had in the 1930s."" Leeward started building the community in the 1980s with his sons and it has grown to more than 170 homes. Some residents left condolences on Leeward's Facebook page. His family also left a message on the page. ""Dear friends, we are deeply saddened by the tragedy at the air race today. Please join us in praying at this time for all the families affected,"" the message said. Leeward, was flying a P-51 Mustang in a Reno air race Friday, when he lost control and crashed. Some witnesses are crediting him with using his flying skills to help limit the number of people injured. 'I was ... preparing to die,' witness at Nevada air race crash says . ""I think he was trying to do whatever he could right up to the end,"" said Fred Scholz, a witness. ""I could hear the engine ... I thought he was coming in on top of us. Instead, he missed us by about 100 feet and went out into the box area in front of us."" Leeward, a son of a pilot, said that he was raised in airports. He worked as a stunt pilot in several films, including ""Amelia"" and ""The Tuskegee Airmen."" He had been part of the Reno air race since 1975, said Mike Houghton, president of the Reno Air Racing Association. ""He was very active in aviation. He did a lot of stunt flying for movies,"" he said. ""He was a close personal friend. Well liked. Great guy. Great family man.""","Leeward, 74, is presumed dead after the Friday crash .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Relations between once strategic allies Israel and Turkey continued to deteriorate Monday as both countries exchanged allegations that their nationals were targeted for intrusive and overly extreme security screening at each other's main international airports. Some 40 Israelis who landed in Istanbul's Ataturk airport Monday morning were individually questioned by Turkish authorities according to Israeli Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ilana Stein. She said it was the first time such an incident had occurred with Israelis nationals flying into Turkey. Another Foreign Ministry official, Yigal Palmor told CNN that Israel was still looking into the incident and seeking clarification as to who gave the instructions for the Israeli passengers to undergo enhanced screening. Speaking to Israeli news portal Ynet one of the detained Israeli passengers said they were asked a series of questions about their travel and instructed to open their bags and show the contents of their computers. ""They apparently got an order to detain us, one by one. Everyone was in shock; we didn't know what they were going to do to us. Obviously this was done intentionally in order to create an unpleasant feeling"" one of the unidentified passengers told Ynet. Another passenger described Turkish authorities specifically identifying Israelis for screening: ""As soon as they saw an Israeli, they told him to move on to questioning. All the Israelis were together and they accumulated the passports in one file... I have never seen them behaving in such disrespect."" A Turkish Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity following diplomatic protocol, would not respond directly to the charges that Israeli passengers were specifically targeted for increased scrutiny, but he pointed out that Turkish passengers leaving Israel were subjected to more intense screening the day before in Tel Aviv's international airport. ""Turkish passengers on the Turkish Airlines flight from Tel Aviv were searched in an unusual manner... and complaints were filed,"" the Turkish official told CNN.  ""On the return of the flight to Istanbul it seems Turkish police have just kept and delayed some passengers for passport control, no questioning,"" he added. ""They were scrutinized in a different matter I guess. In a different manner than the usual,"" the Turkish official told CNN, but he denied that there was some kind of ""tit-for-tat"" treatment of passengers taking place. In report published Monday in the semi-official Anatolian Agency members of a group of Turkish tourists claimed they were forced to undergo additional security screening at Israel's Ben Gurion airport on Sunday as they were preparing to leave Israel. One male Turkish passenger identified by the last name ""Teke"" described being asked a series of detailed personal questions followed by a forced strip search in a special security room. ""They forced me to undo my trousers. While I was getting out angrily, I saw that they were taking some Turkish women in these rooms the same way. This made us even more upset. They only did this to the Turks. They only took Turks to the special rooms,"" Teke told Anatolian. Eyup Ensar Ugur, the guide for a Turkish tourist group told CNN Israeli  airport security singled out Turkish passengers shortly after they checked in  their bags at Ben Gurion airport. ""It was mostly  psychological. Their search was very detailed right down to a pack of tissues.  They were taking out even dirty clothes as they opened suitcases,"" Ugur said.  ""They took us in special rooms for a body search... the situation lasted at least three  hours.  It was very unnecessary.  It was as if they received an order to delay  the process, to bother the people."" Palmor could not comment on the allegations telling CNN that other than media reports Israel had received no official complaint from either the Turkish government or Turkish citizens.  Complaints about excessive security screening and profiling at Israel's Ben Gurion airport are common and have lead to a number of high profile controversies involving foreigners and Palestinians travelling in and out of Israel. The respective airport incidents come on the heels of Ankara's announcement Friday, that it would expel the Israeli ambassador and other high-ranking diplomats stationed in Turkey within a matter of days. Turkey downgraded relations following Israel's refusal to apologize for the killing of eight Turks and one Turkish-American during an Israeli assault on the Turkish flagged ship Mavi Marmara in 2010. The ship had sailed for Gaza carrying supplies and pro-Palestinian activists seeking to break the Israeli maritime blockade of Gaza. The blockade was imposed, according to the Israeli military, to prevent the smuggling of weapons to the Hamas-ruled coastal enclave. A United Nations investigation into the violent maritime event found that the Israeli  blockade of Gaza was a ""legitimate security measure"" in compliance with international law, but it said that Israel had used ""excessive and unreasonable"" force in the takeover of the ship. Israel insists that its soldiers acted in self-defence after being assaulted by the Turkish activists. Istanbul is a popular transit hub for many Israelis traveling to and from Israel. Turkish Airlines flies daily flights between Istanbul's Ataturk Airport and Israel's Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv. CNN's Izzy Lemberg and Kevin Flower reported from Israel; CNN's Yesim Comert and Ivan Watson reported from Turkey.","Some 40 Israelis complain they were singled out in Istanbul .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Syrian activists are denouncing the Turkish government in the wake of the Syrian regime's announcement that it has a deserted army officer in custody. Lt. Col. Hussein al-Harmoush defected months ago and began broadcasting video statements denouncing the Syrian government, before eventually fleeing to neighboring Turkey. News of his detention by Syria comes amid persistent international consternation with that country's regime for its fierce crackdown on anti-government protesters, a six-month outpouring that has resulted in more than 2,600 deaths. ""Enough is enough,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Thursday, urging ""some coherent measures"" against President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Omar al-Muqdad, a prominent Syrian opposition activist who is now in exile in Turkey applying for refugee status, said the Turks handed al-Harmoush over to the Syrian secret police. ""The Turkish government is directly responsible for Harmoush's destiny, because Harmoush was a refugee on their territory. They have to be honest about him. ...under international rules, any country that receives him has to protect him,"" al-Muqdad said. Al-Harmoush had called on all Syrian soldiers to defect and mobilize against al-Assad.  Eventually he fled Syria to Turkey. Two weeks ago, al-Muqdad called CNN in a panic, saying al-Harmoush had gone missing from the refugee camp in Turkey where he'd been living.  At the time, he suspected Syrian security agents had kidnapped the defecting officer. ""I talked to him on the morning of August 29th,"" al-Muqdad said. ""He said 'I have a meeting with a Turkish security man.  When I finish I will call you.'  I waited for three days and didn't hear from him.  Then after that we discovered that the security man took him and didn't send him back to the camp.  They sent him to Syria directly.  The Turks made a trick with Harmoush.  They caught him in Turkey and sent him to Syria."" The Syrian Arab News Agency said Syrian TV broadcast an interview or what it called a ""confession from al-Harmoush"" on Thursday night. Al-Harmoush said he defected because of bloody incidents, but he was not ordered to open fire on civilians. He said opposition members, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, contacted him while he was in Turkey.  He discussed talk of weapons and money. He said he didn't get the kind of support he was promised. The interview didn't indicate how he returned to Syria. Another Syrian activist, Omar Idilbi of the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, said that from what Syrian TV is showing, there are signs that al-Harmoush has been tortured. CNN has previously asked the Turkish Foreign Ministry about al-Harmoush, but Turkish diplomats said they were not familiar with his case. Turkish Foreign Ministry officials were accompanying Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on a tour of Egypt, Tunisia and Libya. One official who requested anonymity told CNN the government ""on principle"" never hands over people who came to Turkey on humanitarian grounds. There are more than 7,600 Syrian refugees in six Turkish refugee camps and there is daily traffic back and forth across the borders. In Egypt, the first stop on the Turkish delegation's trip, Syrian activists tried to confront Erdgoan about al-Harmoush. When Erdogan emerged from the headquarters of the Arab League in Cairo on Tuesday, a crowd of angry Syrian activists stood outside the gates chanting ""Erdogan coward"" and ""Erdogan, where is Harmoush?"" Erdogan waved to the crowd, apparently not understanding the question. But one Syrian activist cornered a senior Turkish official next to the government motorcade and demanded to know al-Harmoush's whereabouts. The Turkish official had no idea what he was talking about. Turkey is critical to the Syrian opposition movement.  Dissidents have fled to Turkey to escape the ongoing government crackdown in Syria and have been holding opposition meetings in Turkish cities. On Thursday, a Syrian opposition council is announcing its creation in Istanbul, the latest in a number of groups claiming to represent the opposition in Syria and abroad. But now, with Syria announcing it has al-Harmoush in custody, opposition activists said they feel betrayed by the Turkish government. ""I can't trust the Turks any more.  They are hypocrites,"" said al-Muqdad. ""There are a lot of questions that the Syrian government and the Turkish government should answer,"" said Idilbi, who is based in Beirut, Lebanon. The importance of al-Harmoush to the Syrian regime became evident September 8, when opposition activists and residents inside Syria called CNN to report Syrian security forces had attacked the village of Ibleen, where al-Harmoush's brother Mohammed lived. According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a number of Syrian army defectors had taken shelter in Ibleen while awaiting the chance to smuggle themselves across the nearby border to Turkey. Video filmed of the aftermath of the Syrian government raid showed blood-spattered houses, burned-out cars and trucks, and a ransacked home. At least five people were killed in the raid, including al-Harmoush's brother.  His corpse was shown in another video released by opposition activists. Thousands of people attended his funeral. Syria's state news agency claimed responsibility for the raid on Ibleen, saying Syrian security forces had killed a number of ""armed terrorists"" who had been residing there. Violence continued Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said security forces killed one person and wounded five others in the Damascus countryside. A volunteer Red Crescent medic who was wounded in the western city of Homs last week has died of his injuries at a Lebanese hospital, the group said. Last month, al-Assad told the U.N. secretary general that military operations in the country had been halted. The regime has indicated that it wanted to end the fighting and foster stability. ""These promises have been broken promises,"" Ban said said Thursday.

"(CNN) -- A new one-volume guide to virtually every rumor, controversy, assertion and accusation about Sarah Palin -- scurrilous or otherwise -- is about to hit the stands, and it's already generating a storm of controversy. ""The Rogue: Searching for The Real Sarah Palin"" by Joe McGinniss is a merciless review of Palin's personal life and meteoric rise from the mayor of a small Alaskan town to the center of America's political universe. CNN obtained a copy of the book -- which relies heavily on unnamed sources -- earlier this week. Palin critics will find some of their worst assumptions about the former governor reinforced by McGinniss; Palin defenders will be outraged.  The book portrays Palin as an image-obsessed governor who was ill-prepared for the burdens of Wasilla's town hall -- much less for the Republican presidential ticket. If that's not enough for you, how about charges of racism, adultery, and cocaine abuse?  Her parenting skills also leave something to be desired, if McGinniss is to be believed. Needless to say, those closest to the former governor are not amused.  The Palin family has had a rocky relationship with McGinniss since he moved in next door to their home in Wasilla last summer to research the book. Palin's husband, Todd, accused McGinniss this week of ""relentlessly stalking my family to the point of moving in right next door to us to harass us and spy on us to satisfy his creepy obsession with my wife."" ""His book is full of disgusting lies, innuendo, and smears,"" Todd Palin asserted. The former governor told Fox News that McGinniss ""needs to get a life."" The Palin circle is not alone in its criticism of McGinniss.  New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin called most of the book ""dated, petty and easily available to anyone with Internet access.""  Maslin accused McGinniss of using his time living near the Palins ""to chase caustic, unsubstantiated gossip,"" often attributed to unnamed sources such as ""a friend"" or ""one resident."" In an interview broadcast Thursday on NBC's ""Today"" show, McGinniss said: ""I think I was as fair as I could possibly have been given the fact that (Palin) told all the people who were closest to her not to talk to me."" Palin ""overreacts,"" McGinniss said.  ""She has no modulation in her responses to stress."" McGinniss' other notable books include ""The Selling of the President"" in 1969 -- a critical review of Richard Nixon's first successful presidential campaign -- and ""Fatal Vision"" in 1983 about Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald, a military physician who was convicted of murdering his wife and children. He also wrote a book about Alaska -- ""Going to Extremes"" in 1980. McGinniss' website calls his latest work ""an extraordinary double narrative that alternately traces Palin's curious rise to political prominence and worldwide celebrity status and then recounts the author's day-to-day experiences as he uncovers the messy reality beneath the glossy Palin myth."" Among other things, the book cites an unnamed friend who claims Sarah Palin once snorted cocaine off an overturned 55-gallon oil drum while on a snowmobiling trip.  As for Todd Palin, he ""did coke with us all,"" former friend John Bitney says in the book.  ""He was on the end of the straw plenty."" ""I'm not saying Todd and Sarah Palin today abuse cocaine or even use it, but there is no question they both did at one point in their lives,"" McGinniss told NBC. Bitney was fired from his position as Gov. Palin's legislative director because he ""dared to embark on a romantic relationship with the estranged wife of a friend of Todd's,"" McGinniss writes in the book. McGinniss also repeats an allegation that Palin had an affair with Brad Hanson, one of her husband's former business partners. Hanson denied the charge in a statement Thursday, calling it ""a complete and outright lie."" One gossipy tidbit: Palin had a sexual encounter with former NBA star Glen Rice in 1987, before she was married.  Rice played for the University of Michigan at the time. ""She freaked out afterward,"" McGinniss quotes a source in the book as saying.  ""The thing that people remember is ... how completely crazy she got"" over the fact that she had sex with an African-American.  ""She was just horrified.  She couldn't believe that she'd done it."" Rice, according to McGinniss, remembers Palin as ""a sweetheart."" McGinniss states that, as governor, Palin fired roughly two dozen state employees who had formed a coalition known as the Diversity Group.  ""Her distaste for people of color ... became manifest,"" McGinniss asserts. ""Sarah just isn't comfortable in the presence of dark-skinned people,"" Bitney says in the book. McGinniss also cites unnamed friends in characterizing Palin as a subpar mother. ""From the start ... Todd was the parent,"" one source says in the book.  ""When he was home, he changed the diapers.  He fed the kids.  Sarah never lifted a finger."" In her New York Times review, Maslin complained that McGinniss spent too much time writing about his own day-to-day experiences and not enough on detailed research. Noting that McGinniss' book includes a comment by one source on the condition of the Palins' toilet, Maslin wrote: ""A journalist as seasoned as Mr. McGinniss surely knows what these details will do to his credibility regarding the book's more serious claims."" Right or wrong, the book has thrust McGinniss into a media spotlight that continues to follow Palin despite the fact that she is no longer in public office and has not announced any campaign for the White House in 2012. There is even a ""Doonesbury"" connection to the latest Palin drama.  Garry Trudeau, the celebrated creator of the long-running comic strip, last summer developed a story line with one of his stock characters -- Fox News TV journalist Roland Hedley Jr. -- moving next door to McGinniss in Wasilla to spy on his spying on the Palins. McGinniss subsequently contacted Trudeau and the pair came up with a way to release tweet-sized advance excerpts of the book in ""Doonesbury"" -- this time via a pre-publication copy of the manuscript of ""The Rogue"" that lands in the fictional Hedley's hands. The ""Doonesbury"" story line has Hedley's boss at Fox News warning him to protect fellow Fox contributor Palin in his coverage of the book, and Hedley tweeting misleading depictions of the real excerpts. Several newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, have decided against running the installments of ""Doonesbury"" that involve the Palin book. ""This week we are not publishing 'Doonesbury' comic strips because they do not meet our standards of fairness,"" said a published note by Tribune Editor Gerould Kern.  The Tribune noted that copies of the book were unavailable for review. Maslin wondered in her review what was stopping the Tribune and others from publishing the cited strips. ""Is it the book's intrepid reporting, or its questionable tone?"" she asked. ""Mr. McGinniss's most quotable, inflammatory lines call Ms. Palin a clown, a nitwit, a rabid wolf and a lap dancer -- and those aren't the parts that assail her as a wife and parent.""

"(CNN) -- A Louisiana justice of the peace who drew criticism for refusing to marry an interracial couple has resigned, the secretary of state's office said Tuesday. Keith Bardwell resigned in person at the Louisiana secretary of state's office, said spokesman Jacques Berry. The state Supreme Court will appoint an interim justice of the peace to fill Bardwell's position, Berry said, and a special election will be held next year to fill the position permanently. Bardwell, a justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused to perform a marriage ceremony for Beth Humphrey, 30, and her boyfriend Terence McKay, 32, both of Hammond, Louisiana, and sign their marriage license. The two were married by another justice of the peace. The couple filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against Bardwell and his wife, Beth Bardwell, on October 20, claiming the two violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Bardwell, speaking to CNN affiliate WBRZ, said he was advised ""that I needed to step down because they was going to take me to court, and I was going to lose."" ""I would probably do the same thing again,"" he said. ""I found out I can't be a justice of the peace and have a conscience."" Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, D-Louisiana, who had called for Bardwell's dismissal, said Tuesday night that ""Bardwell has finally consented to the will of the vast majority of Louisiana citizens and nearly every governmental official in Louisiana. Bardwell's refusal to issue marriage licenses to interracial couples was out of step with our Louisiana values and reflected terribly on our state. We are better off without him in public service."" Initial reports were that Bardwell refused to issue a marriage license to the couple, but in the lawsuit Humphrey and McKay say they obtained the license from the parish court clerk's office and contacted Bardwell to see if he would perform the ceremony and sign the license to legally validate the marriage. Humphrey wound up speaking by telephone with Beth Bardwell, the lawsuit said, and Beth Bardwell asked Humphrey if they were a ""mixed couple."" When told they were an interracial couple, Beth Bardwell said, according to the lawsuit, ""We don't do interracial weddings,"" and told her the two would have to go outside the parish to marry. Bardwell did not return repeated phone calls from CNN in October, but told CNN affiliate WAFB that he had no regrets about the decision. ""It's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you haven't done wrong,"" he said. In addition, he told the Hammond Daily Star in an October story that he did not marry the couple because he was concerned for the children that might be born of the relationship and that, in his experience, most interracial marriages don't last. ""I'm not a racist,"" he said. ""I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house. My main concern is for the children."" Humphrey said in October that she wanted Bardwell to resign. ""He doesn't believe he's being racist, but it is racist,"" she said. According to the lawsuit, Bardwell estimated he refused to marry at least four other interracial couples in the past 2½ years. ""Defendant Beth Bardwell ... aided, abetted and conspired with defendant Keith Bardwell to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutionally protected civil rights,"" according to the suit. No response to the suit has been filed, and it was unclear whether the Bardwells had retained an attorney. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, claiming that Humphrey and McKay suffered emotional distress as a result of the incident. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said he believed Bardwell should lose his license, and the National Urban League called for an investigation into the incident by the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, saying in a statement that Bardwell's actions were ""a huge step backward in social justice."" According to the Census Bureau, Tangipahoa Parish is about 70 percent white and 30 percent black. The U.S. Supreme Court tossed out any racially-based limitations on marriage in the landmark 1967 ruling in the case Loving v. Virginia. In the unanimous decision, the court said that under the Constitution, ""the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.""

"(CNN) -- It's truly the dog days of summer in the South. The heat wave that has encompassed many Southern states this week is not expected to loosen its grip in the coming days. Scorching high temperatures are in the forecast over the weekend in the North. Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Omaha, Nebraska; and Oklahoma City are several cities under an excessive heat watch Friday through Sunday. And little relief is expected next week. An area of high pressure is anticipated to circulate hot and humid air over much of the central and eastern part of the country, the National Weather Service said in a statement Thursday night. ""Heat index values in excess of 110 degrees are likely,"" it said. Extreme heat indices -- how the air feels, with heat and humidity -- are expected to reach up to 116 degrees in Minneapolis next week. ""These are extreme out-of-the-ordinary temperatures for Minnesota,"" CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington and other areas in Texas experienced afternoon heat indices of 105 degrees or more through Thursday. The month of June was the hottest recorded for Texas since 1895, according to the National Weather Service. Lawton, Oklahoma, and Wichita Falls, Texas, shot past the 100 mark for the area's 16th consecutive day of triple-digit heat Thursday. In Oklahoma City, forecasters are calling for nearly another full week of temperatures near or above 100 degrees, threatening to break a 1936 record for 22 consecutive days of such heat. The heat has driven up the demand for water and shrunk soil, resulting in low water pressure and burst pipes in Oklahoma City. Officials issued mandatory water-use restrictions for the first time in at least a decade, according to utilities department spokeswoman Debbie Ragan. More than 200 people have suffered from heat-related emergencies in Tulsa and Oklahoma City since June 17, when the agency issued its first heat alert, said Lara O'Leary, spokeswoman for the Emergency Medical Services Authority of Oklahoma. Forecasters say people should limit outdoor activity during the hottest times of day, wear lightweight clothing, drink plenty of water and watch for signs of heat exhaustion, which include heavy sweating, pale and clammy skin, a weak pulse, fainting and vomiting. At the peak of the past week's heat wave, more than 20 states from the Plains to the Northeast were under heat advisories.","Heat wave hits many southern states this week .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan and U.S. officials say the two governments held face-to-face talks in Tunisia over the weekend, but Washington says the sole point of the meeting was to repeat its demand that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi ""must go."" The disclosure came nearly four months into the bombardment of Libya by NATO allies, including the United States. Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim called Saturday's talks ""a first step,"" adding, ""we welcome further steps."" ""We are ready to discuss ideas to move forward, make sure that people are not harmed any more, that this conflict comes to an end and that the damaged relationship between Libya and the (United) States and other NATO countries can be repaired,"" Ibrahim said. But in Washington, a U.S. official familiar with the meeting said the purpose of the meeting was ""for us to convey directly that Gadhafi must go."" And a senior State Department official called the three-hour session in Tunis ""a one-time meeting to send a clear message,"" not the start of negotiations. NATO has been bombing Libya under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from troops loyal to Gadhafi, who is battling a rebellion that has claimed control of the eastern half of the country. Libyan officials had been reaching out to Washington with increasing frequency in recent weeks with no response, said the State Department official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. After Friday's announcement that the United States would recognize the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya's rightful government, the official said the Obama administration wanted to tell the Libyans face-to-face what it has been saying publicly: that Gadhafi must go. Saturday's meeting was ""a straightforward effort to send a very clear message to the Gadhafi regime,"" the official said. And after conversations with people who spoke to the Libyans afterward, the Libyans are believed to have heard and understood the U.S. position, the official said. Ibrahim said in June that Libya would not consider a peace initiative that would require Gadhafi to step down. The State Department official said talks involved three American envoys and four Libyan officials. One of the Americans was the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Gene Cretz. Cretz was recalled from Libya in December amid the disclosure of embarrassing U.S. diplomatic cables published by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli was shuttered and American personnel evacuated by sea and air in late February, after the current revolt against Gadhafi erupted. CNN's Ivan Watson and John King contributed to this report.","U.S. officials told Libya that Gadhafi ""must go,"" an American official says .

"London (CNN) -- Police charged a bank trader with fraud Friday, a day after he was arrested in connection with the discovery of unauthorized deals at Swiss banking giant UBS. City of London Police said Kwaku Adoboli appeared in court later Friday, charged with two counts of false accounting and one charge of fraud by abuse of position. During the proceedings, Crown Prosecutor David Levy said this was in connection with losses in excess of $1.5 billion. Separately, UBS said Thursday that it estimated its losses at around $2 billion. The suspect was not obliged to and did not enter a plea. Clad in a V-neck sweater, a crisp white shirt, and gray slacks, the suspect wiped his eyes from time to time but otherwise did not appear visibly upset. The court ruled that Adoboli will remain in police custody until his next hearing, set for Thursday. Adobili can apply for bail during next week's proceeding. A commital hearing has been set for October 28. The 31-year-old was arrested in an early morning operation in London's banking district hours before the loss was announced on Thursday, police said. His first name has been spelled elsewhere as Kweku. The Financial Services Authority, the Serious Fraud Office and the Crown Prosecution Service are also involved in investigating the case, the City of London Police statement said. The bank declined to comment on the arrest. Shares in UBS rose slightly in early trading in Europe Friday after falling around 10% the day before. The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said, but the size of the loss it reported is almost unprecedented. Credit rating agency Moody's has said it is looking at UBS for a possible downgrade. Its review of UBS will focus on ""ongoing weaknesses in the group's risk management and controls"" as revealed by the reported loss, Moody's said in a statement. Moody's downgraded two French banks earlier this week amid questions over their exposure to debt. News of the alleged rogue trader came amid pronounced economic anxiety in Europe. Markets there have been in turmoil in recent weeks as concern has mounted that Greece might default on its huge debt, sending shock waves through the 17-nation eurozone and further afield. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner attended a meeting of Europe's Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday, at which questions around Greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone were discussed. Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies were also present. The conference comes ahead of G20 and IMF meetings later this month. Lex van Dam, a former trader who is now a partner at Hampstead Capital in London, said a bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities. UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, he added. UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated. But the ""unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank"" could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said. The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading. Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel cost his French bank, Societe Generale, almost $6 billion, and was sentenced to three years in prison last year. Yasuo Hamanaka cost Sumitomo Corporation $2.6 billion in the global copper market, and was sent to prison for eight years over fraud and forgery in 1997. Nick Leeson, the subject of the Ewan McGregor movie ""Rogue Trader,"" lost about $1.3 billion for his bank, Barings, in 1995, forcing it to close. UBS made a pre-tax profit of about $1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year, it announced in July, down from about $2.5 billion the quarter before that. CNN's Erin McLaughlin, Nina dos Santos, Laura Smith-Spark, Irene Chapple, Ben Rooney, Alex Mohacs, James Partington, Laura Perez Maestro, Kendra Petersen, Nick Thompson and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","NEW: Kwaku Adobili, in police custody, has a Thursday hearing .

"(CNN) -- Police in London are lining up a huge police operation for the Notting Hill Carnival in the wake of the rioting and looting that hit the city earlier this month. More than a million people are expected to head to west London over the course of the colorful two-day event, which features music, parades, dancing and stalls serving up Caribbean favorites like jerk chicken and rice and peas. Some 5,500 officers will be on duty at the carnival on Sunday and 6,500 on Monday -- a public holiday in Britain -- with 4,000 additional officers deployed elsewhere across the city on top of usual police numbers, London's Metropolitan Police, or Met, said. Commander Steve Rodhouse said creating a safe environment at the carnival is ""a top priority"" for the police force. Speaking to the press earlier this week, he said police had intelligence to suggest that some gangs intended to cause trouble at the event. ""I want to say to those who want to come to corrupt this magnificent event: You are not welcome,"" he said. ""Please do not come. The Met will do everything in its power to make it as hard as possible for you."" Officers will carry out checks for weapons as people enter the area, he said in a prepared statement. Forty-three people have already been arrested as part of the Met's annual Operation Razorback, which aims to deter suspected troublemakers from committing crime at the carnival. Organizers say the carnival will finish at 7 p.m. on Sunday and Monday -- an earlier time than usual -- in a bid to keep trouble from breaking out. The event started four decades ago as a local festival set up by the West Indian community of the Notting Hill area. Now, it involves a huge costumed parade, live bands, more than 40 static music stations and hundreds of food stands. There had been speculation the carnival, which its organizers say is Europe's biggest street festival, might be canceled after the disorder that hit the capital's streets three weeks ago. Tens of millions of dollars of damage was caused to shops and business in the violent disorder, with the west London borough of Ealing, north London's Tottenham area and Croydon to the south of the city among the worst affected. As of Thursday, there had been 2,006 arrests for a variety of offenses connected with the unrest, with 1,135 people charged so far, the Metropolitan Police said. Some 950 people have already appeared in court and 42 have been jailed. Officers investigating the unrest have about 20,000 hours of security camera footage to watch and are working on more than 1,200 crime scenes, the police said.","Thousands of extra police officers will be deployed in west London and elsewhere .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Bret is expected to strengthen as it moves away from the Bahamas and out to sea, the National Hurricane Center said Monday. As of 2 p.m., Bret -- the second tropical storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season -- was about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Great Abaco Island, according to the hurricane center. The storm had been about 65 miles (105) from the island earlier Monday. The storm is drifting to the north-northeast and is expected to pick up speed and strength as it moves away from land, according to forecasters. Grand Bahama Island and the Abaco Islands in the northwest Bahamas nevertheless remained under a tropical storm warning Monday. Bret could dump 2 to 4 inches of rain in the northwest Bahamas. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) Monday afternoon, with higher gusts.","Tropical Storm Bret begins to move away from land .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola has said the Spanish and European champions will fight until the end of the transfer window to sign Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas. Guardiola, 40, is confident the Spain midfielder can improve his squad. The former Barca captain also confirmed the Catalan giants are chasing Udinese forward Alexis Sanchez. ""Barcelona have made an offer, Arsenal another and we have until 31 August to try to reach an agreement,"" Guardiola told a news conference. ""We will fight to the end to try to get Cesc because we believe he will improve the team and the squad."" Copa America flops: Who is to blame? Fabregas, a midfielder who was a member of Spain's 2010 World Cup winning squad, is a product of Barca's La Masia youth academy, and has been frequently linked with a return to Catalonia. Chilean international Sanchez scored 12 league goals for Udinese last season as Francesco Guidolin's side qualified for the European Champions League, and Guardiola admitted strengthening Barca's attack was more important than adding to their midfield ranks. ""Between a midfielder and a forward our priority is a forward, but there's money for two players."" But Guardiola denied Barca would only be able to sign one of the two transfer targets. ""According to what Andoni [Zubizarreta, the club's technical secretary] has told me there is enough money to sign both, and that is what we will try to do."" On Sanchez, 22, Guardiola added: ""He's very young, he can play in three positions of attack ... and according to what they have told me he is a very nice guy."" Barca are currently in the U.S. as part of their preparations for the 2011-12 season and the 21-time Spanish champions begin their league title defense away to Malaga on August 21.","Josep Guardiola has said Barcelona will fight to sign Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas .
