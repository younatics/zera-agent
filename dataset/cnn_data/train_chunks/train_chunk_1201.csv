"The secluded Anglesey farmhouse has been home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for three years . With a private beach and stunning views of Snowdonia, it is the four-bedroom Anglesey farmhouse where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent their first years of marriage. As William and Kate prepare for the next stage of their lives, their love nest is incredibly back on the rental market. Unsurprisingly, the owners expect to be inundated with offers to move in. New tenants may even get to meet the couple, who reportedly love the cottage so much they plan to visit for holidays. The unique offer comes after Prince William announced said last week he will quit full-time military service to spend time with his family. He is due to move to apartments in Kensington Palace with Kate, George and their dog Lupo which have been restored at a cost to the public of £1million. While William paid £750 per month for three years to rent the North Wales farmhouse while he served at RAF Valley, it is likely the rent will now rise substantially. The farmhouse, which sleeps eight in four bedrooms, comes with access to . a private beach and boasts breathtaking views of nearby Newborough . Forest, Llanddwyn Island and Snowdonia. Inside, there is a living room with an open fire, dining room with . French doors, a Kitchen, utility room and cloakroom on the ground floor. Upstairs, there are four twin bedrooms and two of these can be turned . into doubles. One has an en suite bathroom with a toilet and another has . an en-suite bathroom with a bath, shower cubicle and toilet. Kate and William have been living at the farmhouse for the past three . years, although more recently Carole Middleton joined them to help the . duchess and the baby settle in. The new housekeeper, Antonella Fresolone, who used to work for the Queen . at Buckingham Palace, also travelled to Anglesey after George was born . and cooked for the royal couple. Until now, it was not permitted to report where it was – or even how many rooms it had – for security reasons. Prince William served as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot at the base in Anglesey before announcing his retirement from service last week . Remote beauty spot: The Menai Strait looking from Anglesey towards Snowdonia on mainland north Wales close to where William and Kate have lived in a four-bedroom farmhouse . The couple have been seen by locals speeding along country lanes on William’s red and white 180mph Ducati superbike. One local publican said William and Kate were ‘just like any other young couple in love’. He added: ‘He seems to enjoy our home-made burgers and chips. Kate prefers fish and salads.’ 'Prince William usually drinks bitter, perhaps a pint or two, and Kate sticks to white wine and sparkling water,' he added. Owned . by Sir George Meyrick, one of the richest men in Wales, the farmhouse . within land given to Sir Meyrick's ancestors by King Henry VII. Remote: The view from Llanddwyn Beach, Anglesey. William and Kate rented their property for £750 a month, but it is now likely to rise substantially . Prince George, born in July, has flown to Scotland with his royal parents to meet great-grandfather Prince Philip . Prince Philip has been introduced to his great-grandson, Prince George, for the first time since his birth in July. The eight-week-old future king flew to Scotland on a private jet with his parents yesterday afternoon. He was taken to Balmoral, the Queen’s private Highland estate, to meet the 92-year-old royal. Charles and Camilla are at their nearby home, Birkhall. Philip was the only senior royal not to have met the third in line to the throne. At the time of George’s birth he was recuperating at Sandringham after an abdominal operation. Now George is at Balmoral, there is a rare opportunity for a unique family photo to be taken. For the first time in more than a century, three generations of heirs to the throne are alive: Prince Charles, 64, Prince William, 31, and newborn George. The last time such a picture was taken was in 1894 when Queen Victoria was photographed with her son Edward VII, grandson George V and great grandson Edward VIII. A royal insider said: ‘Everyone has been waiting for this photo to be taken, and of course the Duke of Edinburgh has been looking forward to seeing his great-grandson. It’s wonderful that the family have finally got together.’","Four-bedroom farmhouse back on market as couple leave after three years .

"The trial of disgraced Army private Bradley Manning has revealed troubling information about the May, 2011, raid on Osama bin Laden's Pakistani hideout: one of the raid members - presumably a Navy SEAL member - suffered memory loss stemming from 'repetitive' traumatic brain injury. The raid member, identified only as 'John Doe,' may testify at Manning's trial to demonstrate that files that Manning released to WikiLeaks ended up in bin Laden's possession, as they were found inside his Abbottabad, Pakistan, complex when it was raided by members of SEAL Team Six. Traitor? Manning is escorted out of a courthouse Monday, the fourth day of his court martial . According to a filing in Manning's court marshal, the presumed SEAL has 'occasional short-term memory deficiencies,' like forgetting where he put his car keys. The memory issues, the raid member says, started two to three years ago, which means he would have suffered from the memory issues prior to the raid on the terror mastermind's compound. The raid member, however, says the memory issues 'do not impact my life in any discernible way' and have not effected his memory of the raid that killed bin Laden. The memory issues arose as prosecutors plan to argue that Afghanistan War Logs and the Department of State's diplomatic cables that were leaked by Manning were found in bin Laden's compound in an attempt to prove that the leaks were a direct threat to U.S. security. The raid member's testimony presumably would be used to establish a chain of custody of the documents found in the compound. Life: the Army Private First Class faces life in prison if he's convicted of the most serious charges against him . Manning's trial, which is heading into its fifth day, comes three years after the Army private first class was first arrested for allegedly stealing classified government documents and giving them to the anti-secrecy website . In all, Manning, 25, faces charges of larceny, aiding the enemy and violating the Espionage Act, as well as 10 lesser counts - such as improper handling of classified information and impeding the order and discipline of the military - on which he already has pleaded guilty. Manning has been considered both a hero and a traitor after his May, 2010 arrest for giving the sensitive government materials to Wikileaks -  his supporters say he is a 'political prisoner' who simply shed light on serious problems within the military and the U.S. government as a whole. His critics say he put American lives at risk by distributing military secrets that could help enemies of the U.S. kill soldiers. WikiLeaks attorney Jennifer Robinson takes a break outside of the courthouse during the fourth day of Manning's trial . Of the items Manning is alleged to have stolen and given to the website are more than 250,000 diplomatic cables, more than 500,000 Army battlefield logs, and videos of airstrikes in Baghdad and Granai, Afghanistan, during which soldiers are heard making disparaging remarks about the men they had just killed. Manning says he stole the information after becoming disillusioned with U.S. actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a policy geared towards 'killing and capturing people.' 'They dehumanized the individuals they were engaging and seemed to not value human life, and referred to them as, quote-unquote, dead bastards,' Manning said of the video of the airstrikes, noting the 'blood lust' the soldiers appear to show by their comments. Australian human-rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson has been a member of a legal team representing Julain Assange and WikiLeaks in London and has been attending the court marshal . Manning's attorney, David Coombs, issued a brief statement on his website prior to this week's court marshal. It reads in part, ""On behalf of both myself and Pfc. Manning, I would like to thank everyone for their continued support over the last three years."" He also thanks supporters for raising money and awareness of the case. Coombs has made few public statements during the Manning case. If convicted of the more serious charges, Manning faces up to life in prison.","The raid member might be called to testify in Manning's court marshal to show that documents he leaked to WikiLeaks were found in bin Laden's Pakistani hideout .

"It is a glimpse of the future of racing cars - where lasers are used instead of combustion engines, and the only cockpit displays are beamed onto the driver's helmet. Chevrolet says the Chaparral 2X Vision Gran Tursimo (VGT) concept was developed for the  PlayStation 3 racing game, Gran Turismo 6 - but the firm has now built a real model of it, unveiled today at the LA Auto Show. It says the technology in the car could eventually make it onto roads. Scroll down for video . The game version of the car will be capable of a 240-mph top speed in the video game with 0-60 acceleration capability of 1.5 seconds . The driver lies face down with the driver's arms and legs splayed toward the wheels to drive the car . The game version of the car will  be capable of a 240-mph top speed in the video game with 0-60 acceleration capability of 1.5 seconds. 'This concept is an audacious and ambitious vision – and one that demonstrates to a new audience how Chevy's engineering and design teams challenge norms and explore the technologies of tomorrow,' said Clay Dean, executive director of advanced design. 'It also an ode to a unique partnership that pioneered ground-breaking technologies that are used today on the track and the street.' The Chevrolet Chaparral 2X VGThas a unique shape and an advanced, laser-based propulsion system. 'It was created in a no-rules atmosphere to challenge designers and test engineers to deliver the most exhilarating sensations. 'This is a fantasy car by design,' said Frank Saucedo, who oversaw the team that worked on the concept. 'Like the original Chaparral race cars decades ago, the Chaparral 2X VGT weaves advanced aerospace technologies into the design to help achieve its performance goals.' The Chaparral 2X VGT's concept propulsion system is inspired by technology derived from advanced work targeted at space travel and future aircraft design. It features a mid-mounted laser beamed-energy propulsion system, which pulses beams of light that focus in a shroud, creating shock waves that generate tremendous thrust in the lightweight race car.

The front of the Chevorlet Chaparral 2X Vision Gran Turismo concept car is shown during its world debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show . With a 671-kW laser, powered by a pack of lithium-ion batteries, and an air-powered generator to provide 900 horsepower worth of thrust, the Chaparral 2X VGT will be capable of a 240-mph top speed in the video game with 0-60 acceleration capability of 1.5 seconds. The propulsion system's position in the composite chassis complements an unconventional yet highly active prone driver configuration – face down with the driver's arms and legs splayed toward the wheels. In fact, the race car's propulsion and suspension systems are built around the driver, enabling progressive strategies of active and driver-adjustable aerodynamics. 'Think of it as adapting a wing suit to a racing car, where the driver's movements control certain aspects of the aero package,' said Saucedo. 'In many ways, the Chaparral 2X VGT is like racing wing suit, with a protective fuselage for 'flying' very low to the ground.'

The propulsion system's position in the composite chassis complements an unconventional yet highly active prone driver configuration – face down with the driver's arms and legs splayed toward the wheels. The driver-enabled aerodynamics eliminate the need for large, conventional wings and other aero devices used to generate grip-enhancing downforce – an attribute that helps reduce the overall mass of the Chaparral 2X VGT's minimalist structure. Only essential elements are on board, with instrumentation, for example, projected on the driver's helmet visor. Additionally, lightweight chassis components reduce the sprung weight of the race car, enabling the car to provide tremendous cornering grip with a relatively small footprint.

It rolls on 17-inch front wheels wrapped with racing tires. 'The Chaparral 2X VGT is a vision of how advanced technology may shape the look and driving experience of racing,' said Saucedo. 'Chaparral's race cars and methods were seen as outlandish four decades ago, and with the innovative spirit still burning at Chevrolet, the Chaparral 2X Vision Gran Turismo concept might just be a harbinger of motorsports in the next four decades.' Other manufacturers have developed concept race cars for the Vision Gran Turismo project, but Chevrolet is one of the few to transfer it from the digital world to a physical concept vehicle. Gamers can race the Chaparral 2X VGT this holiday season by downloading an online update for Gran Turismo 6, the latest iteration of the best-selling PlayStation franchise that has sold more than 72 million copies worldwide since its 1998 debut.

"AC/DC's Angus Young has revealed drummer Phil Rudd had been 'in a strange place' even before he was charged with allegedly hiring a hitman in New Zealand earlier this month. Young opened up about his troubled bandmate in an exclusive interview with Sydney's Triple M Grill Team. The guitarist says the band had been facing some issues with Rudd's 'strange behaviour' over the last few years. Scroll down for video . AC/DC bandmates Angus Young and Brian Johnson have joked about Phil Rudd's recent run-in with the law with US radio host Howard Stern. In a more recent interview, Young also revealed drummer Phil Rudd has been 'in a strange place' 'He's in a strange place, in a strange situation…It's something we have to get resolved, if we're going forward, something has to get resolved,' Young said in the interview which will air on Tuesday. 'We had a few problems ourselves before he got into this situation. There was a lot of strange behaviour going on. I guess you could put it down to him just not showing up for a lot of what we were doing and when you have to get to a stage where you have to convince someone to be there, you know it wears thin after a while - but it's something we have to resolve. 'It is a bit of a question mark…we go back a long way, he is a great drummer, but I think over these last few years, I don't know what he's got into or anything - I guess it doesn't help the situation that he's in.' Prior to the exclusive interview, Young and AC/DC singer Brian Johnson joked about Rudd's recent run-in with law in New Zealand with US radio host Howard Stern. 'My wife woke me up and said ""Phil's been up to no good"",' Young told Howard Stern. 'Someone said ""who was he trying to hit"". It was his drug dealer.' Police charged Rudd with allegedly hiring a hitman to kill two men in New Zealand in September. Those charges were later dropped. Rudd, who has been with the band on and off for nearly three decades, was charged with threatening to kill and drug possessing in New Zealand earlier this month . Johnson said he was getting ready to fly home to the States and had a cup of coffee in his hand when he saw the news on TV. 'There was this guy getting led out of a car with no shoes on looking like he was f***ing drugged and his head was on backwards,' Johnson said. Young and Johnson were being interviewed about their latest album Rock And Bust when they spoke of Rudd. Police charged Rudd with allegedly hiring a hitman to kill two men in New Zealand in September. Those charges were later dropped. The 60-year-old drummer still faces charges of threatening to kill and possessing methamphetamine and marijuana. He is expected to appear in court on November 27. Stern asked if Rudd was a still a member of AC/DC as a result of the charges. 'We've got to resolve that,' Young said. Young said he fell out of bed when he heard the AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd (pictured) had been charged with hiring a hitman earlier this month . Johnson said he was getting ready to fly home to the States and had a cup of coffee in his hand when he saw the news on TV . Johnson suggested Rudd would not be back in the band. 'I don't think we need to do any firing,' he said. 'The situation will take care of itself. He has gotten himself into a pickle. There is nothing we can do about it. We are talking about criminal charges here. We are talking about judges, we are talking about juries. We are going to go on tour. Nothing is going to stop us.' But the pair made it clear that AC/DC would not break up because of Rudd. 'In the past we have had good drummers who have worked with us,' Young said. AC/DC singer Brian Johnson and guitarist Angus Young gave an audience in New York a preview listening of Rock Or Bust on Tuesday, with Rudd noticeably absent from the appearance .

"She was a little off the mark. Angry locals on the New South Wales south coast have laid into  Kim Kardashian-West after the star made an Australian geography fail. Kim snapped a picture of a Jervis Bay beach at a fashion shoot this week. She captioned the picture 'Sydney'. But she was actually around 200km, or three hours drive, south of the metropolis.

Instagram user @michalafarrell let fly: 'Wow @kimkardashian at least get it right. Jervis Bay is NOT Sydney'. @kirstylee984 added: 'Not even close! When ""promoting"" please get the place right"". Local Australian football player Adam Federici tweeted a pointed correction: 'Jervis Bay!! Not Sydney #hometown,' along with a red-faced, angry emoticon. A resident with apparent deep ties to the area, @kewanaparsons, added: 'As a traditional owner of the area in this photo, this is not Sydney'. The star had taken to the Hole in the Wall Beach in Booderee National Park in the bay's south for a fashion shoot. Shoalhaven Tourism manager Steve Lawson told Daily Mail Australia proud locals were probably 'a little bit disappointed she didn't quite realise where she was.' Kim Kardashian has visited Australia solo - without her daughter North West . Tourism officials told Daily Mail Australia it was the 'perfect place' for a fashion shoot featuring crystal blue waters . Kim's make-up and wardrobe were stored in a white tent set up in nearby bush . Picture perfect: The white sands of Jervis Bay were the site of Kim's photo shoot . 'I feel for her a little,' Mr Lawson said. 'She was obviously a little confused, probably a little bit jetlagged.' He added that Kim's team had selected the best spot on the South Coast for crystal blue water scenes. 'We don't have the Opera House or the Harbour Bridge but we do have the whitest sand in the world,' Mr Lawson said. At time of publication, Kim's wrongly labelled picture had secured more than half a million likes on Instagram and nearly 5000 comments. Local beachgoers were moved on from Kim's beach during her shoot, the local South Coast Register newspaper reported. A tent was erected in the bush for Kim's privacy, and several police and photographers were seen milling around on the sand. Local mayor Joanna Gash told Daily Mail Australia her visit was a positive development. 'She obviously enjoyed her stay and that's what matters,' she said. The social media queen visited Australia to celebrate the launch of her new perfume, Femme Fatale. But ever the businesswoman, Kim made the most of every opportunity during her short visit to Australia. The mega star went for dinner at high-end Sydney restaurant Icebergs Dining Room on Sunday night, just a few hours after touching down in the city. Going solo: Kim is alone on this trip Down Under, after touring the country with husband Kanye West and one-year-old daughter North in September, when they visited Australia Zoo in Queensland . Unlike in September when she was here with husband Kanye West and their one-year-old daughter, North, the mega star is flying solo for this trip. But rather than living it up, the reality star admitted she is missing her little girl. She posted a photo of herself crouching down to tend to North on Instagram, and captioned it: 'Helping my little lady out...just staring at pics of her and missing her.' Her visit to Australia comes just days after Kim's nude cover for Paper magazine was released, and send social media into a frenzy but didn't quite 'break the internet', as the coverline read. Earlier this week, the LA-based star denied reports she was considering buying a Queensland island. G'day Australia!

"Determined: The mother-of-four pulled no punches in telling a manageress that she was well within her right to nurse her baby at the recreation center in Burleson, Texas, while her eldest daughter was in a dance class . When prudish leisure centre staff told Lucy Eades to stop breastfeeding in public, she had a few more important things to get off her chest. The mother-of-four pulled no punches in telling a manageress that she was well within her right to nurse her 16-week-old baby at the recreation center in Burleson, Texas, while her eldest daughter was in a dance class. And in the end the jobsworth was forced to yield and walk away after Mrs Eades correctly pointed out: 'It's the law. I can nurse my child with or without a cover.' The heated exchange was filmed last week at the Burleson Recreation Centre by Mrs Eades' husband who stood quietly by, seeing his strong-willed wife was more than abreast of the situation. He later uploaded the footage to the family's YouTube channel, which, by today, had already been viewed by almost 300,000 people, many of whom left staunch messages of support. The incident began when the female manager at the centre approached Mrs Eades and demanded she cover up for the sake of 'decency'. 'It's like she was waiting on us or saw us for a distance, but as soon as we came in, she told me immediately that I needed to cover up or we needed to leave,' Mrs Eades later told ABC affiliate WFAA. 'I walked up, and was nursing him, just because it's 100 degrees outside, and trying to cover his face and entire body, trying to nurse for such a short period of time -- it's way too hot to do that. It's not fair or realistic.' The mean-spirited manageress approached Mrs Eades at reception and said: 'I have permission from the city authorities to ask you to cover up.' The woman then confusingly states that 'it's an issue of decency' before admitting that she didn't think Mrs Eades' actions were indecent. She continues: 'It's not you. I have permission to ask anybody who walks through the door who's wearing a sports bra or a bathing top to cover up.' Scroll down for video... Heated: The mean-spirited manageress then approached Mrs Eades at reception and said, 'I have permission from the city authorities to ask you to cover up' Standing ground: In the end the manageress was forced to walk away defeated after Mrs Eades correctly pointed out, 'It's the law. I can nurse my child with or without a cover' Mrs Eades replies: 'But there are people in here wearing bathing suits and showing more cleavage and skin than me (and they're not being asked to leave)'. As the staff member says they are not allowed in the lobby either, Mrs Eades hits back:  'It's the law. I can nurse my child with or without a cover.' Her husband then steps in to tell the woman: 'Okay, I'm gonna ask you to stop talking to my wife, that's what I'm gonna ask you to do. 'If you want to do something about it, call the cops, tell them to do it. Otherwise, leave me alone.' Indeed, Texas is one of 45 states that have laws that specifically allow women to breastfeed in any public or private location. It is legal to breastfeed in public in all 50 states. Family values: The Eades family have a popular YouTube channel and Instagram page (pictured) on which they document their lives as a family of six . After the footage went viral and appeared on WFAA, the City of Burleston released a statement. It said: 'The City of Burleson supports breastfeeding and appreciates recognition of National Breastfeeding Week. 'The city also supports the law, which states, ""A mother is entitled to breast-feed her baby in any location in which the mother is authorized to be."" 'Today, two women were breastfeeding in or near a public entrance to the city's recreation center where we were hosting a camp for youth ages 5 - 13 in addition to other recreation center patrons. 'To be respectful of everyone's rights we asked the women to cover up. There is nothing in the law that prohibits the city from requiring a mother to cover up. 'We also offered a room in an attempt to be more accommodative. The city did not attempt to prohibit breastfeeding and we fully support the freedom of mothers to breastfeed as long as it doesn't infringe on someone else's freedom.' Mrs Eades added: 'This is normal -- this is what breasts are for. Had [the manageress] not made a scene, no one . would have known, it was that discreet. 'I mean the law is there for a reason. It's there to . protect us and we need to make sure we are that voice. We tell them . that's not okay.

"Ever wanted to figure out which burger restaurant chain constitutes as the most popular in the U.S. or your home state? Lettuce tell you all about it. A new map has documented how many people eat what type of burger and where. Food, drink and travel website Thrillist went through over 20 million check-ins on Foursquare, a location-based application that people use to register their whereabouts and leave tips for others. The winner? Hardee's, home of the Mile High Burgers. Scroll down for video . Burger bonanza: Food, drink and travel website Thrillist went through over 20 million check-ins on Foursquare - a location-based application that people use to register their whereabouts and leave tips for others - to map out America's most popular burger restaurants. They are ranked in most popular to least in the key above . Winner: The most popular burger joint in the U.S., according to users of FourSquare, is Hardee's, home of the Mile High Burgers . Jack in the box: This Canadian-made outlet shows up strongest in the Northwest . Burger King: A surprisingly low number for the home of the Whopper, which proved most popular in upstate New York and Nebraska . Culver's: Most famous in its native Wisconsis, alot of other Americans are now fans of the famous ButterBurger . Checkers: Just as Carl's Jr reigned supreme in the west, these double drive-thru restaurants get eaten up in the west, particularly Florida and Pennsylvania . Carl's Jr: A major divide, this charbroiled burger chain fared increasingly popular in the west, but no love east of Texas and Oklahoma . Dairy Queen: While not specifically popular in one area. Dairy Queen did fairly well across the board, although surprisingly low in Florida and Texas . The restaurant took the most amount of states - especially Montana, North Dakota, the Carolinas and West Virginia - but was also spread fairly well across the country. Surprisingly the dominant franchises - McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's - registered the lowest in popularity. However Thrillist contends these old favorites still are favorable. They just didn't show up on the FourSquare data because customers would be less-likely to check-in at one of the restaurants. The resultant map, while limited to just users of the app, is a good guide to seeing what burger is most-popular in each state by scanning through each. Last quarter McDonald’s saw its U.S. sales fall 3 percent as profits tumbled 30 percent, according to The Intercept. It was the 12th straight month of falling sales at the fast food giant. Five Guys Burgers and Fries: This ever-increasing chain has moved out of Washington DC and up into the Eastern Seaboard . In-N-Out Burger: Perhaps most famous California, In-N-Out is actually most popular in Nevada . Krystal: Although concentrated in one area, Krystal dominated in the southwest, especially Tennessee, where it's from . Sonic: Famous for their shakes, Sonic turned up interestingly small numbers in Oklahoma, its birthplace . Steak 'n Shake: Home of the Frisco Melt, this old favorite hits its prime in central Illinois . Wendy's: Even the bacon pretzel cheeseburger didn't get more people into Wendy's, however Thrillist contends that FourSquare users would be less likely to check-in to this popular chain . Whataburger: Texans have a firm hold of their triple meat hamburgers and aren't letting it . White Castle: New Jersey, Kentucky, Chicago and St. Louis - and Harold and Kumar - love White Castle . McDonald's: As with Burger King and Wendy's, McDonald's did not register well on FourSquare, mostly because people wouldn't likely check-in at the Golden Arches .","List was topped by Hardee's, Culver's and Whataburger .

"It could be the ultimate diet - all the benefits of going to the gym, in a drink. Nestle has revealed it is developing 'exercise in a bottle'. It hopes to create a drink or pill that burn fat in the same way that a workout does. Nestle believe it can create a food that mimics the fat burning effect of going to the gym . Scientists at the Nestle's Geneva HQ say they have identified how an enzyme in charge of regulating metabolism can be stimulated by a compound called C13. The researchers looked at how the master regulator of the body's metabolism, an enzyme called AMPK, is controlled at the molecular level. The world's biggest food company, Nestle is better known for KitKat candy bars and Nespresso capsules, . Scientists at the firm's Geneva HQ say they have identified how an enzyme in charge of regulating metabolism can be stimulated by a compound called C13. The findings were published in the science journal Chemistry & Biology, and are a potential first step in developing a way to mimic the fat-burning effect of exercise. The goal is to recreate the effect of exercise in a pill or drink. It will initially be aimed at people with limited mobility due to old age, diabetes or obesity, Kei Sakamoto, the scientist who oversees research on diabetes and circadian rhythms at Nestle, said. His group of researchers looked at how the master regulator of the body's metabolism, an enzyme called AMPK, is controlled at the molecular level. 'AMPK is a key protein in every single cell in your body and is naturally activated by exercise. 'It monitors your energy status, like a fuel gauge in a car, and tells you to fill up when your energy is low,' Professor Sakamoto said. AMPK's role is important as energy is needed for all the key physiological processes in the body, from secreting a hormone to moving a muscle and even brain function. The findings were published in the science journal Chemistry & Biology, and are a potential first step in developing a way to mimic the fat-burning effect of exercise. 'Our research has revealed new knowledge about this master switch. 'In some conditions, such as diabetes, the body doesn't respond properly to insulin and muscle cells reject the message about their need to take up glucose. 'However, even under such medical conditions, AMPK can find an alternative way and take up glucose in muscle,' Prof Sakamoto said. 'Ideally, we'll be able to develop products that will help promote and augment the effects of exercise. He cautioned, however, that no product would ever simply replace exercise. 'Exercise has so many different effects – a cognitive role and physiological function – we'll never be able to mimic all those effects in a single product,' he said. Ed Baetge, Head of the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences, said it was key to understand how to apply the basic knowledge. 'The next stage is to identify natural substances that can influence this molecular mechanism. The goal is to recreate the effect of exercise in a pill or drink. It will initially be aimed at people with limited mobility due to old age, diabetes or obesity. 'This could lead to the development of new dietary approaches with targeted effects on the body that, like exercise, could help in addressing metabolic problems and maintaining a healthy energy balance,' he said. Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, told Bloomberg  points out others have tried to develop fat-burning products before, to no avail. 'A successful attempt in producing metabolic-assisting foods that mimic exercise would be marvelous -- the holy grail,' Sattar said by telephone. 'But there's no such thing as a free lunch. So far no such product has ever passed clinical trials.'","Will use chemicals to recreate the effects of a workout on the body .

"Nasa has sent its Curiosity rover to investigate a mysterious set of rocks they have dubbed the 'pink cliffs' They form a strange ledge that Nasa is keen to examine, and possibly drill into. It is hoped the unique formation could give clues to how Mars formed. Scroll down for video . This small ridge, about 3 feet (1 meter) long, appears to resist wind erosion more than the flatter plates around it, and has been dubbed the 'pink cliff'. This image combines several frames , and the colour has been altered to resemble how it would appear on Earth. Exposed layers on the lower portion of Mount Sharp, where curiosity is, are expected to hold evidence about dramatic changes in the environmental evolution of Mars. That was a major reason NASA chose this area of Mars for this mission. This view is a mosaic of exposures acquired by Curiosity's Mast Camera (Mastcam) shortly before a two-week walkabout up the outcrop, scouting to select which targets to examine in greater detail during a second pass. This small ridge, about 3 feet (1 meter) long, appears to resist wind erosion more than the flatter plates around it. Such differences are among the rock characteristics that NASA's Curiosity Mars rover is examining at selected targets at the base of Mount Sharp. The ridge pictured here, called 'Pink Cliffs,' is within the 'Pahrump Hills' outcrop forming part of the basal layer of the mountain. 'We see a diversity of textures in this outcrop -- some parts finely layered and fine-grained, others more blocky with erosion-resistant ledges,' said Curiosity Deputy Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. 'Overlaid on that structure are compositional variations. Some of those variations were detected with our spectrometer. Others show themselves as apparent differences in cementation or as mineral veins. 'There's a lot to study here.' The pink cliffs image combines several frames taken with the Mastcam on Oct. 7, 2014, the 771st Martian day, or sol of Curiosity's work on Mars. The colour has been approximately white-balanced to resemble how the scene would appear under daytime lighting conditions on Earth. It comes as Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover completed a reconnaissance 'walkabout' of the first outcrop it reached at the base of the mission's destination mountain. A wheel track cuts through a windblown ripple of dusty sand in this Nov. 7, 2014, image from the Mastcam on NASA's Curiosity rover. The view spans about four feet across. This experiment was planned for yielding a view of the inside of the ripple for assessment of particle sizes and composition. One motive for this experiment was to learn why some ripples that Curiosity drove into earlier this year were more difficult to cross than anticipated. Exposed layers on the lower portion of Mount Sharp are expected to hold evidence about dramatic changes in the environmental evolution of Mars. That was a major reason NASA chose this area of Mars for this mission. The lowermost of these slices of time ascending the mountain includes a pale outcrop called 'Pahrump Hills.' It bears layers of diverse textures that the mission has been studying since Curiosity acquired a drilled sample from the outcrop in September. In its first pass up this outcrop, Curiosity drove about 360 feet (110 meters), and scouted sites ranging about 30 feet (9 meters) in elevation. It evaluated potential study targets from a distance with mast-mounted cameras and a laser-firing spectrometer. During a second pass up the outrcrop, the mission is using a close-up camera and spectrometer on the rover's arm to examine selected targets in more detail. The second-pass findings will feed into decisions about whether to drill into some target rocks during a third pass, to collect sample material for onboard laboratory analysis. This patch of Martian bedrock, about 2 feet (70 centimeters) across, is finely layered rock with some pea-size rocks. It lies near the lowest point of the 'Pahrump Hills' outcrop of Mount Sharp, where Nasa hopes researchers will find clues about the planet's past. 'The variations we've seen so far tell us that the environment was changing over time, both as the sediments were laid down and also after they hardened into bedrock,' Vasavada said. 'We have selected targets that we think give us the best chance of answering questions about how the sediments were deposited -- in standing water? flowing water? sand blowing in the wind? -- and about the composition during deposition and later changes.' Curiosity landed on Mars in August 2012, but before beginning the drive toward Mount Sharp, the rover spent much of the mission's first year productively studying an area much closer to the landing site, but in the opposite direction. The mission accomplished its science goals in that Yellowknife Bay area. Analysis of drilled rocks there disclosed an ancient lakebed environment that, more than three billion years ago, offered ingredients and a chemical energy gradient favorable for microbes, if any existed there. Curiosity spent its second year driving more than 5 miles (8 kilometers) from Yellowknife Bay to the base of Mount Sharp, with pauses at a few science waypoints.","Nasa has dubbed  rocky ledge the 'Pink Cliffs' and wants to examine how it seems to resist wind erosion .

"When it comes to the waistline, those from Mississippi and West Virginia appear to be forever expanding. For the ninth year in the row the states have been declared to be the fattest in the nation. West Virginia took home the silver for second fattest state, but the Mountain State is home to fattest city in the country - Huntington. Louisiana came in third for fattest population in the union, meanwhile, Colorado with its mountains and fresh air maintains its title as the leanest in the country. Fat nation: The study found 49 states had an obesity rate of 30 percent or higher. Only Hawaii had an obesity rate under 30 percent, and a few states, including Louisiana and Mississippi, had obesity rates over 40 percent . Simply put: The coastal states appear to be slimmer than those in the south and the Rust Belt area of the country which tend to be the fattest. Hawaii overtook the District of Columbia as second slimmest state. D.C. had held the title of second thinnest state in the nation since 2011. According to new data the largest state in America appears to be living up to its vast size: Alaskans have gotten fatter. Californians, on the other hand, have slimmed down. Overall, the coastal states appear to be slimmer than those in the south and the Rust Belt area of the country.rank lowest in the fattest stakes, while states in the South and the Rust Belt tend to be the fattest. Getting worse? Previous reports have found that most states have rates under 30 percent, and no states have a rate over 40 percent . Part of the reason the states appear to be increasing in girth is because of the way the data was collected. The new findings are based on doctors' measurements of people's height and weight, whereas many previous reports were based on people's reports of their own measurements. In making those previous estimates of state obesity rates, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relied on telephone surveys that asked people their weights and heights; researchers then used this information to calculate people's body mass indexes (BMIs) Around the world, more than 2.1 billion people across the world - around 30 per cent of the global population - are overweight or obese, and the epidemic shows no signs of decline. Experts predict if the current prevalence of obesity continues on its current trajectory, 'almost half the world's adult population will be overweight or obese by 2030'. How fat is your state?

"Bill Cosby's allies are dropping like flies, but the alma mater he so famously adores is not one of among them. Temple University says Cosby remains a trustee of the Philadelphia institution despite renewed scrutiny of sexual assault allegations against him. At least three women have publicly discussed their allegations against Cosby in recent weeks. When asked by philly.com, Temple officials' answer was brief and gave no hint of how the arrangement could change in the future. Still a trustee: Bill Cosby remained a trustee at the Philadelphia college he attended and so famously continues to regularly speak, Temple University . 'Bill Cosby is currently a member of the board of a trustees,' said the spokesperson. Through his lawyer, the 77-year-old comedian has strongly denied wrongdoing. Cosby has never been charged. Cosby, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, is Temple's most famous alum and has been a trustee since 1982. The entertainer often speaks at commencement, drawing huge cheers. In 2006, Cosby settled a lawsuit filed by a former Temple employee who alleged he drugged and fondled her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion. Cosby was represented by Patrick O'Connor, chairman of Temple's board of trustees. Temple serves about 38,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The institution is one of the last still affiliated with the man who was once America's most adored TV dad. NBC has scrapped a Cosby comedy that was under development and TV Land will stop airing reruns of 'The Cosby Show,' moves that came a day after another woman came forward claiming that the once-beloved comic had sexually assaulted her. Former model Janice Dickinson is one of the women to recently come forward and accuse America's favorite TV dad of the 80s and 90s with sexual assault . Cosby-related programming has been dropped by Netflix, NBC and TV Land in the wake of renewed sexual assault allegations . NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said Wednesday the Cosby sitcom 'is no longer under development.' A TV Land representative said the reruns will stop airing immediately for an indefinite time. 'The Cosby Show' also was to have been part of a Thanksgiving sitcom marathon. The NBC sitcom and 'Cosby Show' reruns joined a Netflix Cosby standup comedy special, which was indefinitely postponed late Tuesday, as mounting evidence of Cosby's faltering career. They occurred a day after model Janice Dickinson, in an interview with 'Entertainment Tonight,' became the third woman in recent weeks to allege she'd been assaulted by Cosby - charges strongly denied by the comedian's lawyer. The developments, which involve allegations that were widely reported a decade ago as well as new accusations, have gravely damaged the  comedian's reputation at a time when he was launching a comeback. A year ago, a standup special - his first in 30 years - aired on Comedy Central and drew a hefty audience of 2 million viewers. His prospective new series was announced by NBC in January.","The beleaguered comic continues to have a friend in the Philadelphia alma mater he so famously adores .

"A recent study has found that both males and females have their individual flaws when it comes to space travel. The study looked at reports for the 534 astronauts - 477 men and 57 women - that had been to space up until June 2013. And while women were less likely to suffer a loss of hearing or vision, it was found that men had an overall greater tolerance for spaceflight in a number of categories. A study by Nasa and and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) looked at the role of gender in spaceflight. They looked at records of more than 500 astronauts up to June 2013 and presented their findings in the Journal of Women's Health. Illustrated are some of the findings (click for a larger view) The report, published in the Journal of Women’s Health, was carried out by Nasa and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI). They assembled six workgroups to investigate and summarise  human spaceflight data. They focused on cardiovascular, immunological, sensorimotor, musculoskeletal, reproductive and behavioral implications for men and women who had travelled to space. In the study, it was found that women were less likely to suffer a loss of quality of vision owing to space travel, and men were also more likely to suffer more hearing problems. However women were found to have a worse orthostatic intolerance - which is the inability to stand without fainting - upon returning to Earth. Othrostatic intolerance . This is the inability to stand without fainting. It was found to be more prevalent in women after returning to Earth. Winner: Men . Loss of blood plasma . Women lose a greater volume of blood plasma during spaceflight than men, while their heart rate also increases more during stressful situations. Winner: Men . Vision impairment . Men are more likely to have their vision impaired by spaceflight, according to the study. 82 per cent of male astronauts versus 62 per cent of female astronauts were found to be affected by Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome. Winner: Women . Immune system . No noticeable difference between male and female immune responses was observed in space. On the ground, however, women have a more potent immune response than men, although they are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases. Winner: Tie . Radiation . Permissible radiation exposure levels are lower for female than male astronauts as it has been shown that women are more susceptible to radiation-induced cancer. Winner: Men . Motion sickness . After arriving at the microgravity environment on the ISS, female astronauts were more likely to suffer from space motion sickness (SMS) compared with men. However, on returning to Earth men were more likely to suffer from motion-sickness symptoms. Winner: Tie . Loss of hearing . As they grow older, men are much more likely to lose hearing sensitivity at several frequencies compared to women. Winner: Women . Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) UTIs were found to be more common in women in space, but can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Winner: Men . Behavioural problems . There was found to be no difference in terms of behavioural or psychological responses to spaceflight in men and women, owing to the intense psychological training that all astronauts must undergo according to the researchers. Winner: Tie . Women also had a higher heart rate in stressful situations and were more susceptible to radiation-induced cancer, while Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) were more common in female astronauts than males. There were no noticeable differences in behavioural responses to men and women in spaceflight, while other factors such as the effectiveness of immune systems in space required further data for a meaningful conclusion to be drawn. Ultimately, at the moment men seem to have fewer problems than women in travelling to space - but the researchers stress more data is needed, especially for female astronauts. Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome was identified in 2005, and it is currently Nasa's leading spaceflight-related health risk. It was found to be more predominant among men than women in space. Here, Nasa astronaut Karen Nyberg uses a fundoscope to image her eye while in orbit . The reason for the study is that the health and safety considerations for astronauts will grow more and more difficult as Nasa and other agencies attempt longer-duration spaceflights. For example, the ISS partners will soon begin year-long stays for crews on the space station, as opposed to the six-month missions that currently take place. With that in mind, Nasa is looking to develop personalised medicine for astronauts who could spend years working away from planet Earth. One of the key considerations in creating this medicine will be the gender of the astronaut in question. Nasa is taking strides to redress the imbalance of the number of men and women that have been to space. For example, the 2013 astronaut candidate class, shown here in front of an Orion crew capsule mockup, comprises four women and four men . Last month science writer Kate Greene, who took part in a simulated mission to the red planet, argued that the first mission to the red planet should be crewed by only women. Last year she took part in a Nasa project called Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation), which simulated a long-duration mission to Mars on Earth. Ms Greene and five other crewmembers - three men and three women in total - spent four months in a dome on Hawaii, only leaving the habitat in mock spacesuits. She says it was rare for a woman to burn more than 2,000 calories a day, whereas men regularly exceeded 3,000. Her conclusion is that sending women to Mars would be cheaper and more feasible than one with men. On Earth, of course, gender plays a huge role in deciding what treatment to give to a particular person, and similarly Nasa wants to know the implications of gender on spaceflight. ‘Fortunately, we have the International Space Station,’ said Dr. Marshall Porterfield, Director of Space Life and Physical Sciences Research at Nasa. ‘[The] station provides us with years of biological data on male and female astronauts, and many of them continue to participate in ground-based studies to evaluate the lasting effects of spaceflight.’ However, one issue with the study was that a vastly greater number of men have been to space than women - 477 compared to just 57. Nasa is seeking to redress that balance, with their latest crew selection being four women and four men, but it remains hard to draw definitive conclusions from the data available. The findings of the report recommended that more women are selected for space missions. They also suggested encouraging more people to take part in ground and flight studies on Earth, while gender should also be incorporated into Nasa-funded research programmes.","Study by Nasa in California looked at role of gender in spaceflight .

"Netflix now accounts for more than a third of all internet traffic during peak evening hours in North America, according to new research. The movie and TV streaming service is responsible for a staggering 35 percent of all bandwidth usage while the second most popular, YouTube, accounts for just 14 percent. After Netflix, YouTube, web surfing and Facebook, home internet users' favorite applications include BitTorrent, iTunes, Amazon and Hulu, according to networking company Sandvine's latest edition of its biannual Global Internet Phenomena Report. Netflix now accounts for more than a third of all internet traffic during peak evening hours in North America, according to new research . Home broadband users are using 30 percent to 40 percent more data than last year, with typical consumers using 20 Gigabytes monthly. Netflix’s streaming service has long dominated downstream internet usage - a point that’s sparked battles between it and Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon, which have argued Netflix should pay up for the bandwidth it uses. HBO Go, the streaming version of the US premium cable channel HBO, just missed the top 10, accounting for 1% of usage. That number will almost certainly go up once a standalone internet version of HBO Go becomes available sometime next year. Amazon Instant Video is also beginning to pick up steam, though its share is still minuscule compared with Netflix’s, and the service is currently not even available in Canada. After Netflix, YouTube, web surfing and Facebook, home internet users' favorite applications include BitTorrent, iTunes, Amazon and Hulu, according to networking company Sandvine . ‘With both Netflix and Amazon Instant Video gaining bandwidth share in North America during 2014, it will be fascinating to see how a standalone HBO Go streaming option will impact networks when it launches in 2015,’ said Sandvine president and CEO Dave Caputo in a statement. ‘The dynamic streaming video market underscores how important it is that operators around the globe have the business intelligence and big data solutions in place to understand the ever-changing behavior of their subscribers.’ These figures don’t account for internet connections made via cellular data networks on mobile devices. On that front, YouTube is the leader with a 19.75 percent share, and Facebook is right behind it with a 19.05 percent share.

"A student shamed after she was too fat to fit on a rollercoaster has lost an incredible eight stone so she can finally ride on Colossus. Thrill-seeker Emma Cooper, 24, from Ashford in Kent, was enjoying a day out at Thorpe Park when she found the harness would not shut over her size 24 figure. After the embarrassing experience she embarked on a drastic weight-loss journey kick-started by a three-month specialist diet programme. Emma (second from left) pictured on a ride, was unable to fit on Colossus at Thorpe Park . With Diet Chef Emman slimmed to 12 stone and now wears size 10 clothes . Now that Emma has gone from her heaviest at 20 stone to just 12, she has returned to the theme park to triumphantly take on the white knuckle ride. Emma said: 'It was the most embarrassing moment of my life - I couldn't believe that I was too big to pull the barrier down. 'I knew I had to do something and it is great thinking that I'm now plenty slim enough to go on any rollercoaster I want!' The marketing student had been trying to lose weight since arriving at Plymouth university weighing 20 stone. Six years later Emma, whose university course is four years long, has taken two gap years and is currently in her placement year, healthier and happier. The student returned to Thorpe Park to finally ride on Colossus in 2014 . Despite considering a gastric band aged just 18, she decided to try and lose weight alone and managed to shift some of the excess pounds by cutting out crisps and chocolate. But the final straw came when she climbed on to the ten loop rollercoaster for a friend's birthday and could not buckle the barrier. After the embarrassing theme park incident, size 24 Emma vowed to lose the excess weight for good. Emma looking glam after her weight loss . She said: 'I have quite good self-control when it comes to buying food for myself, it was just my portion sizes. 'I never really ate unhealthily - I just ate a lot. 'My mum had a gastric band fitted and I was considering one before I went to university but I realised that I had my whole life ahead of me and I wanted to try and lose weight by myself. 'The turning point was when I went to Thorpe Park for my friend's birthday and I couldn't fit under the harness.' Emma signed up for Diet Chef in June 2014. The weight loss programme provided her with breakfast, lunch and dinner for three months. Emma ditched giant meals and late-night McDonald's for vegetable soups and nutritious pasta dishes as well as taking up running. She dropped three stone in just three months taking her to 13st. After the programme Emma realised she enjoyed the Diet Chef food and the way the meals helped her to manage her portions, so she has continued to incorporate them into her diet and has lost an extra stone since then. Emma would eat three portions at a time and arrived at university weighing 20 stone. She managed to shift some of it on her own by buying smaller bowls and plates to trick her brain into eating less . Emma, right, pictured at around 16 stone, before she had lost all the weight that she wanted to lose . The final straw came when she climbed on to the ten loop ride and could not buckle the barrier . Her commitment to healthier eating meant she shrunk from 16 to 12 stone and now wears a slim size 10. Emma's weight loss was gradual initially. It was only when she started Diet Chef that she properly started shopping again, and can now buy slinky outfits for glam nights out. To celebrate her incredible transformation she headed back to Thorpe Park to ride the ten loop coaster. Emma added: 'I love rollercoasters and I was gutted I couldn't get on. But mainly it was the shame that I had to walk off in front of everyone as the ride went round. 'I love going fast and the thrill of a rollercoaster - I was the only person that would go on it with my friend - and I just had to get off and watch as the ride went round without me. Emma has transformed her life - and her look - after shifting the final four stone . Breakfast: Triple-size bowl of cereal . Lunch: Two large sandwiches and crisps . Dinner: Extra-large pizza with energy drinks and ice cream . Snacks: Late night burger and chips and a multi-pack of crisps . Breakfast: Regular-sized bowl of low-sugar cereal . Lunch: Diet Chef pasta bowl - only 236 calories . Dinner: Gammon steak with grilled veg . Snacks: None . 'While I was at uni I tried to lose weight gradually by making small changes. 'I even bought smaller bowls and plates to trick my brain into eating less because sometimes I was eating three times a normal portion. 'Doing Diet Chef helped me so much and it took this huge chunk of weight off. 'I used it to teach myself what normal people eat and how much they eat. 'And it was great going back to Thorpe Park knowing I wasn't going to have a problem taking on Colossus as many times as I wanted!'

Singer called Traitz 'the latest example of people coming out of the woodwork with unsubstantiated or fabricated stories about my client.' Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. He then added, 'There was no briefcase of drugs and the story is absurd.' Five women have come forward in the past month and claimed that they were drugged and raped by Cosby, four of them when they were teenagers. One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her. The other four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them. Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredibly Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her at a part at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby even tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after hiw own wife, Camille, left the room. When asked to speak about these claims in an AP interview, Cosby said he had 'no response' and 'no comment.' These allegations are already having a major impact on his work however, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star. Cosby has also had scheduled appearances on talk shows including The Queen Latifah Show and Late Night With David Letterman cancelled in the wake of these allegations. TV Land has also announced they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network.","Linda Joy Traitz, who recently said Bill Cosby offered her pills and tried to get 'sexually aggressive' with her as a teen, has a long criminal history .

"Researchers have uncovered a massive shift in the Earth's plates they say created the 'perfect storm' for life on Earth to explode - and reveals North America was once attached to Antarctica. The Cambrian explosion is one of the most significant events in Earth's 4.5-billion-year history, and the surge of evolution led to the sudden appearance of almost all modern animal groups. Fossils from the Cambrian explosion document the rapid evolution of life on Earth, but its cause has been a mystery. A new analysis from The University of Texas at Austin's Institute for Geophysics suggests a deep oceanic gateway, shown in blue, developed between the Pacific and Iapetus oceans immediately before the Cambrian sea level rise and explosion of life in the fossil record, isolating Laurentia from the supercontinent Gondwanaland. The Cambrian explosion is one of the most significant events in Earth's 4.5-billion-year history. The surge of evolution led to the sudden appearance of almost all modern animal groups. Fossils from the Cambrian explosion document the rapid evolution of life on Earth, but its cause has been a mystery. The sudden burst of new life is also called 'Darwin's dilemma' because it appears to contradict Charles Darwin's hypothesis of gradual evolution by natural selection. The paper by Ian Dalziel of The University of Texas at Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences, published in the November issue of Geology, a journal of the Geological Society of America, suggests a major tectonic event triggered the rise in sea level and other environmental changes that accompanied the apparent burst of life. 'At the boundary between the Precambrian and Cambrian periods, something big happened tectonically that triggered the spreading of shallow ocean water across the continents, which is clearly tied in time and space to the sudden explosion of multicellular, hard-shelled life on the planet,' said Dalziel, a research professor at the Institute for Geophysics and a professor in the Department of Geological Sciences. Beyond the sea level rise itself, the ancient geologic and geographic changes probably led to a buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere and a change in ocean chemistry, allowing more complex life-forms to evolve, he said.

The new paper is the first to integrate geological evidence from five present-day continents — North America, South America, Africa, Australia and Antarctica (pictured)  — in addressing paleogeography at that critical time. Dalziel proposes that present-day North America was still attached to the southern continents until sometime into the Cambrian period. Current reconstructions of the globe's geography during the early Cambrian show the ancient continent of Laurentia — the ancestral core of North America — as already having separated from the supercontinent Gondwanaland. In contrast, Dalziel suggests the development of a deep oceanic gateway between the Pacific and Iapetus (ancestral Atlantic) oceans isolated Laurentia in the early Cambrian, a geographic makeover that immediately preceded the global sea level rise and apparent explosion of life. 'The reason people didn't make this connection before was because they hadn't looked at all the rock records on the different present-day continents,' he said. The rock record in Antarctica, for example, comes from the very remote Ellsworth Mountains. 'People have wondered for a long time what rifted off there, and I think it was probably North America, opening up this deep seaway,' Dalziel said.

Although the new analysis adds to evidence suggesting a massive tectonic shift caused the seas to rise more than half a billion years ago, Dalziel said more research is needed to determine whether this new chain of paleogeographic events can truly explain the sudden rise of multicellular life in the fossil record. 'I'm not claiming this is the ultimate explanation of the Cambrian explosion,' Dalziel said. 'But it may help to explain what was happening at that time.'","Cambrian explosion is one of the most significant events in Earth's history .

"An 18-year-old from Michigan who faked her own disappearance and even put an ad on Craigslist to find an abductor has been placed on probation for three years. Hayley Turner of Temperance didn't speak in Monroe County Circuit Court on Thursday. She must perform 29 days of community service and pay $15,200 to the sheriff's office for the 17-hour search. Turner pleaded guilty to causing a false police report to be filed. She claimed to have been abducted at gunpoint on August 7 in Bedford Township, just north of the Ohio-Michigan border. She was found safe with a puppy, 16 hours later in Ecorse, near Detroit. Sentenced: Hayely Turner, seen here at sentencing Thursday, faked her own abduction and has been sentenced to three years probation and is responsible for the $15,200 her manhunt cost authorities . The 18-year-old girl whose disappearance sparked a large-scale manhunt was charged with falsifying a police report. Detectives claim Turner's story that she was held and assaulted for 16 hours in Monroe County, Michigan, last month unravelled during questioning. She was found 45 miles from her home in Bedford Township with slashes across her thighs after a multi-agency search involving helicopters, police dogs and multiple forces. But FBI agents drafted in to tackle the case concluded there were significant gaps in her account - and even insist the cuts on her thighs were self-inflicted to back up her story. Appearing at Monroe County District Court, Turner pleaded not guilty to the charge of filing a false police report. The charge, a felony, was punishable by up to four years in prison and a fine of up to $2,000. Probation: Seen here when first charged in September, Hayley Turner eventually pleaded guilty to filing a false police report after detectives claimed her story unravelled during questioning and even the cuts on her thighs appear to have been self-inflicted . Faced jail: The 18-year-old could have been sentenced to four years in jail if found guilty of filing a false police report . 'Not truthful': Lt Greg Blade, left, and Chief Michael Moore, right, said her story did not stand up to scrutiny . She was found 45 miles from her home in Bedford Township with slashes across her thighs after a multi-agency search involving helicopters, police dogs and multiple forces . Prosecutor William Nichols said: 'If convicted, the court may also order the defendant to reimburse the local unit of government for expenses incurred in the emergency response, police investigation and prosecution of the defendant.' Police claim Turner told her family she was going to a video store in Bedford Township, Monroe County, before her disappearance on August 6. She was then speaking to a friend on the phone  when she said she was stopping to help someone by the side of a road, the sheriff's department said. After a few minutes, Turner told her friend that she was being followed by a man with a gun. Then the call was disconnected. Police were notified, sparking a multi-agency manhunt involving dogs, helicopters and a number of police departments. Her parents even spoke at a press conference and made a tearful appeal for her to come home. Turner's mother Christy Turner spoke at the conference, saying 'Hayley, please call. Call anybody. We miss you. We want you home.' When Turner was found 16 hours later about 45 miles from that spot in Ecorse, a suburb of Detroit, she told officials she had been abducted. However, initial questioning appeared to reveal gaps in her story. A Monroe sheriff's detective and an FBI agent re-interviewed Turner days later, while a team consulted phone records, computer records and other witnesses. Eventually, they appealed to the prosecutor to level charges against Turner. 'As a result of that interview, it was determined that the incident did not take place, as originally reported,' the sheriff's department said in a statement. It said the sheriff's department forwarded its report to prosecutors in Monroe County. Distraught: Turner's mother and father made an emotional appeal for her to come home during the manhunt .

"Engineers were working on a friend-or-foe recognition system for Turkish warplanes at the time of their suicides - a report by neuro-psychology expert Nevzat Tarhan asked that the possibility of telekinesis as a possible cause of the suicides be taken into consideration . Four engineers working at one of Turkey’s leading military electronics companies, who allegedly committed suicide, could all have been killed through telekinesis – the ability to manipulate or move objects with the mind, it is claimed. Hüseyin Başbilen, who was one of the four working at the Aselsan corporation, which has won several defense and technology awards, was found dead in his car in August 2006. Halim Ünal was shot in the head with one bullet in January 2007 while Evrim Yançeken fell from the balcony of his sixth-floor apartment nine days later. Two years later a fourth engineer at the corporation, Burhanettin Volkan, allegedly also killed himself. Başbilen, Ünal and Yançeken were working on a friend-or-foe recognition system for Turkish warplanes at the time of their suicides, brought back to public debate during the so-called Ergenekon coup trials, which saw dozens jailed for life following a plot to overthrow the government. Now a report by the Turkish Prime Ministry Inspection Board has decided the four dead could have been directed toward the suicides by way of telekinesis. The report, presented to the Ankara Public Prosecutor, cites work done by neuro-psychology expert Nevzat Tarhan. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, pictured here centre in Ankara, Turkey, earlier this month. Telekinesis recently made the news after a journalist claimed certain powers were trying to kill the PM through telekinesis . Tarhan’s study asked the prosecution not to disregard the possibility of telekinesis as a possible cause of the suicides, which could have caused severe distress and headaches in the victims, giving them a tendency to kill themselves. The waves, causing the headaches in the victims, could have been sent from 1.5 kilometers away, and could have directed the victims towards a suicidal state of mind, Mr Tarhan told daily Hürriyet. He said an overcharge of electro magnetics could have also had the same effect on the engineers, which would then indicate neglect. Telekinesis recently made the news after journalist Yiğit Bulut claimed certain powers were trying to kill Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdoğan through telekinesis. Just weeks after his theories, Mr Bulut was named a chief consultant for Erdoğan.","Engineers working on a friend-or-foe recognition system for Turkish warplanes at the time of their suicides .

"It is the biggest problem smartphone owners face - smashed screens from dropping their handset. However, Corning, the firm behind the displays in phones from Apple, Samsung and others, has revealed a new version of it's 'Gorilla Glass' it says is twice as  strong. Gorilla Glass 4 passed Corning's meter-high drop test about 80 percent of the time, and it already on its way to manufacturers, the firm said. Scroll down for video . To test the glass, Corning scientists examined hundreds of broken devices and found that damage caused by sharp contact accounted for more than 70 percent of field failures. To test the glass, Corning scientists examined hundreds of broken devices and found that damage caused by sharp contact accounted for more than 70 percent of field failures. The scientists then developed new drop-test machines that simulate real-world break events, based on thousands of hours analyzing cover glass that had broken in the field or laboratory. The scientists used the new methods to drop devices face down from one meter, ensuring the cover glass directly contacted a rough surface when it landed. 'The new Gorilla Glass 4 has been formulated to address consumers' number one issue – screen breakage from everyday drops,' the firm says. 'Corning Gorilla Glass has outperformed competing materials, such as soda-lime glass and other strengthened glass, since it was introduced in 2007, and we're always innovating to push the limits of what glass can do,' said James R. Steiner of Corning. 'With Gorilla Glass 4, we have focused on significantly improving protection against sharp contact damage, which is the primary reason that mobile devices break.

Product sampling and shipment for Gorilla Glass 4 are under way with Corning's global customers, the firm said. It is believed that despite problems with its processing plant, Apple still hopes to use sapphire glass in its Apple Watch and possibly in future iPhones. Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. Apple uses Ion strengthened glass in its handsets. To make ion-strengthened glass, glass is placed into a hot bath of potassium salt, typically potassium nitrate, at around 300°C (572°F). This causes the sodium ions in the glass to migrate, which in turn causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution. The larger potassium ions in the bath squeeze themselves into the holes created by the moving sodium. This compresses the glass, to accommodate the larger ions, which in turn makes it stronger. By comparison, sapphire screens are made from synthetic sapphire - a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass.","Gorilla Glass 4 passed meter-high drop test about 80% of the time .

The group was traveling in the back of a U-Haul. Also detained were the man behind the wheel and his female passenger. Scroll down for video . Creative: A man was found hidden away Friday inside a washing machine after he illegally crossed the Mexican border into the U.S. According to KGBT, the immigrants were offered medical attention, which they declined. Homeland security is investigating. Meanwhile, high-ranking U.S. Senate Democrats last week called on the Obama administration to reverse its new policy of detaining Central American immigrant families, warning it could be damaging to the young children being housed in the facilities. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont and eight other Democrats wrote Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Thursday to complain about the detentions. 'Mothers and their children who have fled violence in their home countries should not be treated like criminals,' wrote the senators, who also included Democratic leadership members Dick Durbin of Illinois, Charles Schumer of New York and Patty Murray of Washington state. The detention policy, which was initiated this past summer as tens of thousands of families and unaccompanied children rushed to the U.S. border, is part of a broader White House strategy of deterring another influx next year. Fellow travelers: The man was in the back of a U-Haul truck traveling north alongside four other immigrants who were inside a cardboard box . Many of the migrants are fleeing El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where gang violence, drugs and human trafficking are rampant. In 2009, the United States stopped housing newly arrived immigrant families in a troubled Texas detention facility. Instead, the Obama administration made less restrictive measures, such as ankle bracelets, telephone interviews and other monitoring programs the centerpiece of its policy for keeping tabs on migrants awaiting court determinations on their status. But that changed a few months ago, as President Barack Obama was under intense pressure from Republicans in Congress to stop the record numbers of children and families seeking refuge in the United States and arriving without visas. He responded by directing the opening of family detention centers, expediting immigration court cases, refusing bond for many of the migrants and working with Mexico to secure borders. By year's end, the federal government will have the capacity to detain about 4,000 mothers and children at any one time in centers located in New Mexico, Texas and Pennsylvania.

"Christians use fewer negative words on Twitter and are more likely to talk about their social relationships than self-professed atheists such as Ricky Gervais . Christians use more positive words and engage in less analytical tweeting than atheists, according to new university research. Computer analysis of nearly two million tweets has found that Christians use fewer negative words and are more likely to talk about their social relationships than atheists on Twitter. The research was carried out by University of Illinois graduate student . Ryan Ritter, alongside fellow graduate student Ivan Hernandez and psychology . professor Jesse Preston. The findings are reported in the journal of Social Psychological & Personality Science. To identify Christian and atheist Twitter users, the researchers studied the tweets of more than 16,000 followers of a few prominent Christian and atheist personalities on Twitter. They analysed the tweets for their emotional content, such as the use of positive and negative words as well as the frequency of words such as 'friend' and 'brother' that are related to social situations. They also looked at the use of words such as 'because' and 'think' that are associated with an analytical thinking style. The research found that overall, tweets by Christians had more positive and less negative content than tweets by atheists. Christians used less analytical and more social words, which were correlated with the use of words indicating positive emotions, the researchers said. 'If religious people are indeed happier than nonreligious people, differences in social support and thinking style may help to explain why,' said University of Illinois graduate student Ryan. He believes that the findings are in line with other studies linking greater levels of social connectedness to higher well-being. Professor Preston said: 'Religious communities are very social. Just being a member of a religious group connects people to others, and it may be this social connection that can make people happier. 'On the other hand, atheists had a more analytical thinking style in their tweets than Christians, which at extremes can make people less happy.' Previous research has found a positive . association between religion and well-being among Buddhists, Hindus, . Christians and Muslims. Christians use less analytical and more social words, which correlate with the use of words indicating positive emotions, according to the researchers. They believe that their work might help to explain why religious people might be happier than atheists . However, most of the studies has relied on individuals to tell researchers about how satisfied they are with their lives or their emotional state at a given time. Professor Preston said: ""What's great about Twitter is that people are reporting their experiences – good or bad – as they occur.' 'As researchers, we do not need to ask them how they feel because they are already telling us.' While the authors have drawn their conclusions that Christians appear to be happier than atheists on Twitter, they are careful to say that their results are based on observing correlations. Professor Preston said: 'this does not mean atheists are unhappy overall or doomed to be miserable.' 'If religion improves happiness indirectly through other factors, those benefits could also be found outside religious groups.' The research was partially funded by The John Templeton Foundation, which aids research relating to the 'big questions of human purpose and ultimate reality'.","Researchers found that Christians use fewer negative words than atheists when tweeting .

And as the festival grows increasingly popular with young wealthy tech entrepreneurs from San Francisco, reports suggest the city's upmarket Mission district has been virtually deserted for the past week. On Friday a project almost 12 months in the making called Embrace - a 72-foot wooden sculpture of two people lovingly looking into each other, built across studios in Vancouver and Portland - was reduced to nothing but dust and ash. The remote week-long rave in the Nevada desert - often described as 'where Mad Max meets Woodstock' - culminates each year with many of the statement artworks going up in flames, in a symbol of catharsis, reflection and new beginnings. 'In short, Embrace is about asking people to consider why death is so challenging and why it’s also so beautiful,' lead artist Matt Schultz said on a website for the sculpture.

"Attack: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin criticised the U.S. at a youth camp yesterday . Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has launched a scathing attack on the United Stated and accused them of being a 'parasite' on the world economy. Putin said the superpower was living beyond its means 'like a parasite' and said dollar dominance was a threat to the financial markets. The remarks from Russia - one of the world's strongest emerging markets - comes amid speculation that the struggling U.S. will this week have its AAA credit rating downgraded. 'They are living beyond their means and shifting a part of the weight of their problems to the world economy,' Putin said. 'They are living like parasites off the global economy and their monopoly of the dollar,' he told the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi today. US President Barack Obama earlier announced a last-ditch deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling and avoid a crushing default that would have repercussions around the world. The deal initially soothed anxieties and led Russian stocks to jump to three-month highs, but jitters remained over the possibility of a credit downgrade. 'Thank god,' Putin said, 'that they had enough common sense and responsibility to make a balanced decision.' But Putin, who has often criticised the United States’ foreign exchange policy, noted that Russia holds a large amount of U.S. bonds and treasuries. 'If over there (in America) there is a systemic malfunction,  this will affect everyone,' Putin told the young Russians. 'Countries like Russia and China hold a significant part of their reserves in American securities ... There should be other reserve currencies.' U.S.-Russian ties soured during Putin’s 2000-2008 presidency but have warmed significantly since his protege and successor President Dmitry Medvedev responded to Obama’s stated desire for a 'reset' in bilateral relations. Talking tough: Putin poses as he take part in arm wrestling during his visit to the Summer camp. During the visit he said that the U.S. was effectively punching above their weight on the world stage . Observant: Putin takes notes while sitting on a military box during his visit to the camp, and right, the Prime Minister flexes his muscles on a climbing wall . Putin's attack on the U.S. comes as lawmakers there passed an 11th-hour bill last night to raise the U.S. lending limit and avoid a calamitous debt default. Despite successfully passing the rescue package, the President must now deal with criticism from both sides of the aisle over the uneasy compromises that were made to pass the legislation. Both Republicans and Democrats saw the bill as an unpalatable necessity and were only able to reach acceptable terms after weeks of bickering and brinkmanship. The deal thrashed out between party . leaders will see America’s legal ‘debt ceiling’ rise by up to . £1.46trillion – from the £8.71trillion limit it formally reaches today – . which will take the country beyond the election and into 2013. Desperate: U.S. President Barack Obama talks about the debt ceiling crisis in the briefing room at the White House in Washington on Sunday . Repercussions: Workers at a foreign exchange firm in Japan monitor markets as Obama makes an announcement on the debt ceiling . More bad economic news and finger-pointing in Washington quickly overshadowed early optimism on Wall Street over the debt deal – with fears persisting that America will still see its credit rating downgraded this week. Putin criticised the U.S. during a trip . to the youth group Nashi while he was touring its lakeside summer camp . some five hours drive north of Moscow. Commentators said that the swipe at the . ailing U.S. economy looked like early campaigning before parliamentary . and presidential polls. Partner: Putin may not stand aside for President Dmitry Medvedev (pictured) Casually dressed in khaki trousers and a striped white shirt, Putin flew by helicopter to the tented camp as part of a string of appearances that are being closely watched in the run-up to the elections. He did not say whether he plans a return to the Kremlin or will stand aside for Medvedev, his partner in Russia’s leadership tandem, to run for a second term. But young people crowding round Putin, caught up in the campaigning spirit created by huge portraits of Putin hung from trees, were not shy about saying who they wanted as president. 'Russia’s next president will be small, bald and look like Putin,' 17-year-old Ilya Mzokov joked with reporters. Asked why Medvedev was not paying a visit to the summer camp, he said: 'Only serious people come here.' Youngsters chanted Putin’s name and applauded his remarks as he strolled round the camp, where US-style business seminars, extreme sports and political mudslinging were among the topics on offer. Putin, whose macho image appeals to many Russians, briefly swung himself up the first half of a climbing wall, filmed by a gaggle of state television cameras. Nashi, which means 'Our People', was created by the Kremlin to counter popular dissent after youth activism helped topple a pro-Moscow government in Ukraine’s 2005 Orange revolution. The group has worked to spread a personality cult around Putin and regularly campaigns against Kremlin critics. Opinion polls show Putin, still widely viewed as the country’s paramount leader, retains near 70 percent approval. But his United Russia party is trying to reverse a slide in popularity before December parliamentary polls, hoping to use a strong showing there to help Putin in the March 2012 presidential vote.","Superpower has 'shifted' its problems onto the world .

"Danger: Older people with moderately low blood levels of vitamin D are up to two-thirds more at risk of contracting dementia or Alzheimer's in later life . Older people with low vitamin D levels were more than twice as likely to develop any kind of dementia, warn researchers. An international team, led by Dr David Llewellyn at the University of Exeter Medical School, found people who were severely deficient were up to 125 per cent more at risk of dementia or Alzheimer’s. Those with moderately low blood levels of vitamin D were up to two-thirds more at risk. It is the first large study to investigate the relationship between vitamin D and dementia where the diagnosis was made by an expert team using neuroimaging and other tests. Previous research suggests people with low vitamin D levels are more likely to go on to experience cognitive problems, but this study confirms a link to a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. The team studied 1,658 Americans aged 65 and over who were able to walk unaided and were free from dementia, cardiovascular disease and stroke. The participants were then followed for six years to see who went on to develop Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. Those who were moderately deficient in vitamin D had a 53 per cent increased risk of developing dementia of any kind, and the risk increased to 125 per cent in severely deficient people. Similar results were recorded for Alzheimer’s disease, with the moderately deficient group 69 per cent more likely to develop this type of dementia, jumping to a 122 per cent increased risk for those severely deficient. It found a link with higher dementia rates when vitamin D levels fell to the lowest level, as well as a threshold for good health. The findings show when blood levels fall below 50 nanomol (nmol) of vitamin per liter of serum, the risk starts to increase. Vitamin D levels above 50 nmol/L are most strongly associated with good brain health, says the study published in the journal Neurology. Dr Llewellyn said: “We expected to find an association between low Vitamin D levels and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, but the results were surprising – we actually found that the association was twice as strong as we anticipated. ‘Clinical trials are now needed to establish whether eating foods such as oily fish or taking vitamin D supplements can delay or even prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. ‘We need to be cautious and our latest results do not demonstrate that low vitamin D levels cause dementia. Trials: Almost 2,000 elderly people were surveyed by the University of Exeter Medical School for six years . ‘That said, our findings are very encouraging, and even if a small number of people could benefit, this would have enormous public health implications given the devastating and costly nature of dementia.’ The body makes most of its vitamin D from sunlight on the skin, but older people can be less efficient at converting UV exposure. Although the vitamin is found in oily fish, and is routinely added to milk, diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream. Prof Gordon Wilcock, Emeritus Professor of Geratology, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, said ‘This study confirms the suggestion from previous research that there is a link between low vitamin D levels and the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Action: Researchers urge health officials to prioritise treatment trials in people with low levels of vitamin D to see if supplements could prevent the onset . ‘It emphasises the need for treatment trials in people with low levels of vitamin D to see if supplements could prevent or delay the onset of dementia, or improve memory function after it has deteriorated. ‘One could make a case for checking vitamin D levels in older people who have a poor diet, or who have little exposure to the sun, or alternatively as a part of an older persons’ routine screening programme, because vitamin D is important for other health reasons as well as memory problems and dementia. ‘Dementia is such a devastating disease that preventing or slowing down its progression, if this proves possible with vitamin D supplements, would be extremely important even if the number of people who benefited seems small.’ Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at Alzheimer’s Society charity, said ‘During this hottest of summers, hitting the beach for just 15 minutes of sunshine is enough to boost your vitamin D levels. ‘However, we’re not quite ready to say that sunlight or vitamin D supplements will reduce your risk of dementia. ‘Large scale clinical trials are needed to determine whether increasing vitamin D levels in those with deficiencies can help prevent dementia from developing.’ Dr Simon Ridley, Head of Research at Alzheimer’s Research UK charity, said the research showed a link between low vitamin D and dementia, but not that it was the cause. ‘To be certain whether increasing vitamin D could help protect against dementia, we would need to see large-scale clinical trials. ‘Anyone who is considering changing their diet to include vitamin supplements should speak to a doctor. ‘In the meantime, there are a number of ways people can lower their risk of dementia, including eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly, not smoking or drinking too much, and keeping blood pressure and weight in check.’","University of Exeter Medical School surveyed 2,000 pensioners for 6 years .

"Warning: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has confirmed a acrylamide, which is found in coffee, is a cancer risk . A chemical found in coffee, chips, burned toast, crisps, crackers and certain types of baby food has been confirmed as a cancer risk by European food watchdogs. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said children are most exposed to the chemical, which is called acrylamide and forms when roasting, frying and  browning food. Health authorities in Britain and Europe have long been aware of the concerns about the chemical and EFSA was asked to establish the scale of the problem and the risk. It has now published a consultation paper, which warns: ‘EFSA has confirmed previous evaluations that, based on animal studies, acrylamide in food potentially increases the risk of developing cancer for consumers in all age groups. ‘Coffee, fried potato products, biscuits, crackers and crisp breads, soft bread and certain baby foods are important dietary sources of acrylamide. On a body weight basis, children are the most exposed age groups.’ The organisation suggests it may be necessary to establish new legal controls for the food industry to try and reduce the levels found in products sold in restaurants and supermarkets. The watchdog said it may also be necessary to issue new advice to home cooks to help them cut levels of the chemical in home cooked meals. Food manufacturers in Britain have been under pressure to change their cooking methods and recipes in order to reduce the levels of acrylamide formed during cooking. Despite this, the chemical remains at high levels in some products, while acrylamide is also created in the home during roasting and frying. A study published by Britain’s Food Standards Agency (FSA) last year found raised levels of the cancer risk chemical have been found in big brand foods from fries sold by KFC to crisps, ginger biscuits and even healthy breakfast cereals. The chair of an EFSA panel set up to examine acrylamide, Dr Diane Benford, said: ‘Acrylamide consumed orally is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, distributed to all organs and extensively metabolised. ‘Glycidamide, one of the main metabolites from this process, is the most likely cause of the gene mutations and tumours seen in animal studies.’ However, Dr Benford, who is head of chemical risk at the FSA, pointed out that the evidence of harm to humans has, so far, only ‘provided limited and inconsistent evidence of increased risk of developing cancer’. The panel has recommended the need for new research involving humans. It also wants surveys to give a better picture of acrylamide levels in food cooked and eaten in the home. Dangers: The watchdog confirmed children were most exposed to the chemical, which is also found in chips . EFSA said: ‘Once finalised, EFSA’s scientific advice will support European and national decision-makers to consider possible measures to further reduce consumer exposure to this substance in food. ‘These may include, for example, advice on eating habits and home-cooking, or controls on commercial food production.’ In the past, there have been higher levels of the chemical in certain children’ s biscuits, but not in the rusks given to the very young. The UK’s FSA has been carrying out regular surveys of high street food to measure acrylamide levels.  The last survey, published in April 2013, found raised levels in 14 products. The biggest problem was with crisps, including a number of expensive brands such as Burts Sea Salted crisps. The UK's FSA has highlighted high levels of acrylamide in Burts Sea Salted Crisps . There were also raised levels in Tesco ready salted crisps, Tayto cheese and onion crisps, Seabrook Sea Salted crisps, Pipers Anglesey sea salt crisps and the Co-op’s Sea Salt and chardonnay wine vinegar crisps. Manufacturers suggested the problem was caused by the bad weather during the growing season of 2012 which changed the sugar levels in the potatoes thus creating more acrylamide during frying. In terms of take-out food, raised levels were found in a sample of KFC fries bought at a fast food restaurant in Congleton, Cheshire, and a fish and chip shop in the same town. Breakfast cereals are promoted as a healthy start to the day. However, those containing bran, which is cooked at a particularly high temperature, can contain more acrylamide. Raised levels were found in Tesco Bran flakes, Sainsbury’s Wholegrain bran flakes, the Co-op’s Wheat bran flakes and Puffed wheat sold under the Good Grain Co. name. Higher than expected levels were also found in Fox’s Ginger biscuits and TUC biscuits. The FSA stresses that it does not consider the levels of the chemical found in the products to be dangerous, however it is keen that they are brought down as a precautionary measure. A spokesman said: ‘The FSA will work with the relevant local authority to encourage food manufacturers to review their acrylamide reduction strategies.’ The watchdog says there is no need for the public to give up the foods named in its survey, however it does publish advice on how people can reduce exposure. This includes cooking chips only to a light golden colour while advising that ‘bread should be toasted to the lightest colour acceptable’.  It said manufacturers’ instructions for frying or oven-heating foods, such as chips, should be followed carefully.","European Food Safety Authority say children are most exposed to acrylamide, which forms when food is roasted, fried or browned .

"Children of illegal immigrants would be banned from schools under plans drawn up for ministers to curb the impact of ‘education tourists’. The idea was put forward by officials told to find ways to limit migrants’ access to benefits, housing, and the NHS but has been blocked by ministers. But David Cameron’s pledge to end the global perception of Britain being a ‘soft touch’ have been slammed as ‘unfortunate’ by Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt. Scroll down for video . Immigration minister Mark Harper (left) and . education minister David Laws sit on the inter-ministerial group looking . at ways to limit migrants' access to benefits and public services . Mr Cameron used a major speech on immigration this week to say the government would make it harder for new arrivals to Britain to claim out-of-work benefits, jump the queue for social housing or get free treatment on the NHS. But it has emerged officials have begun examining how to limit access to free education for children who are in the country illegally. It is estimated that there could be 120,000 children in the UK without legal immigration status. One plan would require headteachers to check the immigration status of pupils before admitting them to lessons. The idea has been put forward in a series of emails sent by officials advising the inter-ministerial group on migrants' access to benefits and public services, The Guardian reported. The group includes schools minister David Laws and immigration minister Mark Harper. A proposal to ban illegal immigrant children from schools was suggested, but there are warnings it could contravene the UN convention on the rights of the child. Mr Laws is said to consider the idea a ‘red line’. David Cameron this week used a speech to promise to tackle Britain's reputation as being a 'soft touch' on immigration . One email sent by a civil servant on . Monday said: ‘Barring children, whatever their migrant status, from . compulsory education has pretty much been ruled out by ministers and at . the moment is off the table for cross-government discussions. ‘The . question now is whether, if not to enforce a ban, it would nevertheless . be helpful to carry out migrant status checks as part of school . admissions.’ Another . email suggested ‘strategies could probably be employed to deal with . “education tourists”, in much the same [way] as “health tourists” are . managed’. The plan was revealed . by Labour MP John McDonnell who accused minister of being ‘diverted to . policy stunts prepared for prime ministerial statements and speeches’ instead of focussing on practical ways to tackle immigration. He . told the Commons that ‘ministerial attention has recently been focused . on discussions in the inter-ministerial group on barring migrant . children from compulsory education’. He . said the Department for Education then intervened and the children’s . rights adviser said: ‘If we were to withdraw the right of education from . any children in the UK, regardless of their status, we would be hugely . criticised for it by the UN. Mr Cameron promised to restrict migrants' rights to unemployment, health and housing benefits . ‘With the periodic review report due to be submitted in January 2014, this would be very controversial.’ Home Secretary Theresa May played down the idea of banning children outright. She said: ‘We have been looking at public services across the board in relation to what we describe as the pull factors. ‘We . have focused on housing, health and the benefits system. We do not . propose not having the provision of education for individual children.’ But she rejected the claim that the government’s policy changes were about publicity stunts. ‘We have been sorting out a chaotic immigration system and immigration policy introduced by the previous Government that led to net migration in this country reaching hundreds of thousands a year. ‘We aim to bring it down to tens of thousands. We have already seen net migration cut by a third. That is not a publicity stunt; it is a real benefit and a policy that the people of this country want to see.’ The move to consider targeting illegal immigrant children was condemned by Lesley Gannon, head of policy at the National Association of Headteachers. She said:  ‘You can't hold children responsible for the behaviours of their parents, it's simply not fair. ‘All of our codes of practice around admissions, behaviour and exclusions have always emphasised that you deal with the child and not the parents in terms of their access to education and their treatment within the school. We wouldn't want to see anything jeopardise that. ‘It's also really worrying to start to drag schools into politics in this way. Yes, we are public servants, part of the state, but once you put that process in place, I'd suggest you're encouraging parents who are worried about their immigration status to avoid putting their children into school, to avoid detection. That puts the educational rights of that child at risk.’ Sweden Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said Mr Cameron's speech was 'unfortunate' Mr Cameron’s speech on Monday focussed on benefits and housing, but was criticised for lacking detail and targeting relatively small numbers of people. He promised that new EU migrants will be stripped of jobless benefits after six months, but critics said existing rules meant this effectively already happened. The PM said net migration needs to ‘come down radically’ after getting ‘badly out of control’ under Labour. He also unveiled a crackdown on so-called health tourism, with hospitals ordered to start charging foreign visitors. Those from outside the EU will need health insurance before being granted a visa. There will be a major shake-up of council housing rules designed to keep immigrant families off waiting lists for at least two years and possibly as many as five. But the speech was criticised by the Swedish Prime Minister. Mr Reinfeldt  said: ‘I think it's unfortunate. I believe in a Europe that should be open, where we have free movement, and where we instead ask ourselves how people who come here can get work more easily.’","Leaked emails reveal officials proposed barring pupils from lessons .

The 23-year-old Michigan resident was accompanied by a man, who was not arrested and has not been identified, reported CBS. Secret Service Spokesman Ed Donovan said Lenhart is not cooperating with the investigation at this time. The arrest took place shortly after President Obama delivered a televised speech about immigration reform inside the East Room. The executive actions ease the threat of deportation for some 4.7 million undocumented immigrants and set up a clash with Republicans who vow to fight his moves. Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback said Lenhart was demonstrating along the north fence of the White House complex when authorities saw a holstered handgun on her hip. She was charged with possession of an unregistered firearm and ammunition, and carrying a pistol without a license. Hoback said she refused to make statements to authorities. Timing: The arrest took place minutes after President Obama concluded his address to the nation on immigration reform . On Wednesday, R.J.

"A man who had been in prison for nearly two decades was released from custody Thursday, two years after his supposed victim recanted allegations that he molested her. Jerry Lee Brock, 55, had been in prison since his conviction for first-degree molestation in 1995. In 2012, the alleged victim, Regina Rush, came forward to say she made the whole thing up, partly as a way to get more attention from her mother. Last week, Thurston County Superior Court Judge Erik Price ordered a new trial after finding the recantation credible, and on Thursday, he signed an order vacating Brock's conviction. The order stated that Brock 'shall no longer remain in the custody of the Washington State Department of Corrections.' Jerry Lee Brock, 55, has been in prison since his conviction for first-degree molestation in 1995 but now the victim who was 11 at the time has recanted her testimony saying she made it all up to get attention from her mom . 'He was all smiles,' said Brock's lawyer, public defender Patrick O'Connor. 'His brother was there to pick him up and take him home. It was very satisfying to see.' Brock was released with a few conditions, including that he remain in the state, not possess firearms and not use drugs. A new trial was scheduled for February, but it wasn't clear prosecutors would proceed with it, given that the girl's story was the primary evidence against him. Rush was 11 years old when she accused Brock, a friend of her mother, of molesting her while she was sleeping. She repeated the allegations at trial, and Brock was convicted. He was sentenced to life in prison under the state's 'three-strikes' law; he also had convictions for burglary and promoting prostitution. But in 2012, Rush came forward to say she was haunted by what she had done. In a six-page, typewritten admission, she denied that Brock touched her inappropriately. She said she made up the story because she wanted attention from her mother and because she worried that Brock was a drug user and a bad influence on her mom. Price held a hearing Nov. 10 to assess Rush's credibility. Now 31 and a mother herself, she testified under oath, detailing that she had previously been taken away from her mother due to her mother's drug use, and she didn't want it to happen again. 'Ms. Rush testified that she realized just how wrong it is to make such serious false accusations,' the judge wrote in his order Thursday. 'The dishonesty was eating away at her inside and she didn't want to carry that burden any longer. ... She simply wanted to clear her conscience.' Prosecutors argued that Rush may be recanting because she disagreed with the length of Brock's sentence. The judge rejected that, noting that Rush didn't even know Brock was still in prison when she came forward in 2012. 'The Court concludes that Ms. Rush's recantation was not motivated by anything other than her stated desire to tell the truth,' Price wrote. No phone listing could be found to try to reach Rush for further comment. O'Connor said he did not expect her to face any legal repercussions for the false report, given her age at the time. Rush's accusation was the main evidence against Brock. While Brock denied fondling the girl, he did tell detectives in one interview that he 'made a mistake.' It wasn't clear what Brock meant by that, however, and the judge said Thursday that the statement alone could not support a conviction. Prosecutors have not said whether they plan to go forward with another trial, although they did ask for a trial date to be set to keep the case on track, Thurston County Prosecutor Jon Tunheim said in an email. The deputy prosecutor handling the matter is in another trial for the next couple weeks, Tunheim said, but 'he will examine the remaining evidence in the Brock case in light of the recent developments and we will decide if there is sufficient evidence to retry the case.' O'Connor said he did not know if his client was ready to speak with reporters. Brock had been serving his sentence at Clallam Bay Corrections Center, where he served as a minister. 'He's a very gentle guy,' O'Connor said. 'He doesn't seem to have any animosity or anger, anything like that.' Washington state adopted a law last year allowing wrongly convicted defendants to be reimbursed $50,000 for each year of incarceration if they can prove they were innocent of the felony they were convicted of. O'Connor said he did not know if Brock planned to file a claim under that provision.","A judge in Olympia has ordered a new trial for a man who has been in prison for 19 years .

A series of requests for Marine Col. George Bristol's testimony from Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, both Republicans, had fallen on deaf ears until Friday. The Pentagon had claimed that since Bristol had retired, it 'cannot compel' him to tell congressional panels what he knows about the Benghazi attack. Chaffetz said on July 9 that the Defense Department was 'not willing to pass along any sort of information' related to Bristol's whereabouts. Now Air Force Maj. Robert Firman has confirmed to MailOnline . that due to an 'administrative error,' Bristol was mistakenly . classified as a retired officer despite his current active-duty status. 'The Department of Defense has fully . cooperated with congressional requests to understand the attacks on the . Benghazi compound,' Firman said. 'Col. George Bristol, USMC, will be . available to meet with House and Senate members and their staffs.' MailOnline has located Bristol's home in Northern Virginia in recent weeks. On Thursday evening a woman answered the door and confirmed that he lived there, but the colonel himself has not responded to four separate requests for an interview. Sources have said Bristol was out of the country on non-military business until July 14. Chaffetz's and Graham's offices did not immediately offer reactions to the Pentagon's change of heart. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (L) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) have been among the driving forces behind obtaining testimony from key military and civilian witnesses to the Benghazi attack. 'You can't do a thorough investigation without talking to everyone who knows something or saw something,' Chaffetz told MailOnline on July 9 . Firman told MailOnline that the about-face came after Sen. Graham sent a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Thursday, asking for reconsideration. That move followed a report in the Marine Corps Times, which cited a Marine Corps source in concluding that Bristol's retirement would not become final until August 1. On Tuesday Firman had told the newspaper, in error, that 'Col. Bristol was not invited by Congress to testify before he retired.' Bristol's testimony could provide a crucial missing link in lawmakers' understanding of what happened in Benghazi. In his letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Thursday, Sen. Graham cited Bristol's 'in-depth knowledge of the region, coupled with his close interaction with U.S. Special Operations Forces operating on the African continent.' '[H]e would be the ideal person to speak with,' Graham wrote, 'about what happened on the ground in Benghazi.' Pentagon spokesman Maj. Robert Firman (L) confirmed that Bristol would be made available to Congress. That followed a letter from Sen. Graham to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel (R) In particular, Republicans in both the House and Senate have been frustrated by their inability to learn why . Special Operations Forces were prevented from boarding a military . plane in Tripoli during the Sept. 11, 2012 attack - a plane that was already preparing . to take off for Benghazi. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, and three other U.S. personnel, died in the attack. On that day, Bristol was commander of Joint Special Operations Task Force-Trans Sahara, placing him directly in the chain of command where decisions were made about evaluating and deploying assault teams when American personnel in Northern Africa are in harm's way. Other military officials have testified before Congress, including Gen. Carter Ham, who appeared on June 26 before a closed session of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Libyan military guards stood watch over the burned-out U.S. Consulate in Benghazi just three days after the attack. The FBI didn't arrive on the scene to investigate for nearly three weeks . U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the Benghazi attack, and Congress is still investigating . Bristol’s LinkedIn profile indicates that he led a task force with authority over military special operations in 12 countries, including forces tasked with countering violent extremist organizations. During a change of command ceremony in March 2013 that saw him rotated out of command, he said 'an evil' had taken hold in Africa, and 'it is on us to stomp it out.' 'Africa is not the next ridgeline,' Bristol told Stars and Stripes. 'It is where the enemy is going now. And we are going to do something about it.' A Pentagon official told MailOnline that incorrect information about Bristol's retirement date reflected 'confusion within different offices in the Pentagon,' and was not a concerted effort to keep the colonel from testifying. But 'we just don't keep a database of where people are' after they retire from active duty, the official added. At that point, 'the VA is responsible for supporting them. They would have a better link to a retiree than the DOD would.' General Carter F. Ham, the commander of the U.S. military's Africa Command when the Benghazi consulate came under attack, testified before a Congressional panel despite his non-active-duty status because his retirement wasn't yet official. The Pentagon now says Col. Bristol's situation is a similar one . The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi is seen in flames after terror organizations, including the al-Qaeda-linked group Ansar al-Sharia, bombarded the State Department's outposts there .","Col. George Bristol was in charge of Special Operations Forces in Northern Africa on the night of the Benghazi, Libya terror attack .
The Dept. of Defense had refused to tell Congress where to find him, claiming that he was retired and entitled to protection under privacy laws .
After pressure from Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Pentagon has changed its mind - now acknowledging that Bristol is not yet retired .
Questions remain about why commandos were not sent to Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, even though a team was standing by to board a plane ."

"A New Hampshire cop was so incensed when he realized a 'distraught' woman had lied about speeding to reach her dying father that he made a point of going to her house and arresting her. Carley Williams, 28, was pulled over by Trooper Christopher Cummings after she was caught speeding down the Everett Turnpike at 82 mph in a 65 mph zone at 9 p.m on August 2nd. Letting her off a ticket on Friday because she told him that her father was down to his dying breaths, Cummings was stunned to discover that not only had she manipulated him, but that her father had died five years ago. Scroll Down for Video . Manipulative: Carley Williams (left and right) escaped a ticket when she told a state trooper she was speeding along a turnpike to reach the bedside of her dying father. This was untrue and the state trooper caught up with her two days later . Tears: Carley Williams allegedly played on the good-natured troopers emotions to escape her ticket on Friday . Pulled Over: Carley Williams was arrested on Everett Turnpike (pictured here) in New Hampshire doing 82 mph in a 65 mph zone and lied to a state trooper to escape punishment . 'I'm pretty used to people trying to bend the truth to get out of speeding citations, but this woman preyed on my emotions as a human being,' Christopher J. Cummings, the state trooper who made the arrest, told ABC News today. 'She told me her father had stage four cancer, that he was breathing only six breaths a minute, and that she was trying to make it to the hospital before he passed,' said Cummings. Williams told Cummings that her father was at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester and she wanted to see him before he passed away. 'I was parked along the turnpike with my radar unit when I saw the vehicle traveling 82 mph in a 65 mph zone,' said Cummings. 'I took her driver's license and asked a question that I ask everyone I pull over. I asked if there was an emergency.' Collared: New Hampshire State Trooper Chris Cummings went to Carley Williams home in Nashua to arrest her and confront her with her lies . Totally accepting of her 'emotional' story, Cummings returned her license and told her to move on, albeit slower. 'There was a good act that went along with it,' said Cummings. 'She seemed pretty emotional. It made me believe that this person was legitimately telling me the truth.' However, just before he sent Williams on her way, he asked for her father's name. 'I called the hospital where Williams told me her father was a patient and asked if he was there. They told me he wasn't,' said Cummings to ABC News. Taken aback by this, Cummings looked up Williams and her father and discovered that her father had died in 2008. 'I was upset,' said Cummings, 'For someone to lie about their deceased father just to get out of a speeding ticket was pretty upsetting to me as a person.' No Special Treatment: Lt. Christopher Wagner said that he supported his trooper especially when he was lied to . Upon further investigation, Cummings realized that Williams was driving with a suspended registration so he headed over to her house because that in itself was a misdemeanor. 'This wasn't personal, it was a matter of law. The violation happened in my presence, so I made the arrest,' he said to ABC News. Traveling to Williams' home on Sunday he brought a copy of her father's obituary and confronted the 28-year-old. 'She came out of her house, looking bewildered, and I told her I wanted her to explain something,' Cummings said. 'She looked at the obituary I had and immediately said it wasn't for her father but that it was for her uncle.' However, once he arrested her for the suspended registration, Williams confessed everything. She was charged with speeding and driving with a suspended registration and is due in Merrimack Circuit Court September 5th. 'While the N.H. State Police is sympathetic to personal emergencies,our . primary objective is to protect life and property through the traditions . of fairness, professionalism and integrity,” police said in a written . statement.

"Jimmie Johnson won his third consecutive Texas fall race Sunday, when none of the eight championship contenders were able to clinch one of the final four spots in NASCAR's Chase for the Sprint Cup championship. Johnson emerged from a frantic finish, the second attempt at a green-white-chequered finish after his team-mate and Chase contender Jeff Gordon spun out from the front after contact with Brad Keselowski. While Johnson celebrated his fourth victory at Texas, an irate Gordon stopped his car on pit road right by Keselowski and confronted him. There were punches thrown in the melee, with NASCAR officials in the middle of crew members and others around the No. 2 car. Jimmie Johnson celebrates winning his third consecutive Texas fall race Sunday after a frantic finish . Johnson takes the chequered flag to win the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race on Sunday . Gordon was leading on the first green-white-checkered attempt on lap 335, in a race scheduled for 334 laps, when he took the outside lane. When Gordon drifted up a bit, Keselowski pushed through the gap, and made contact that left Gordon's car with a cut tire. 'We were just racing for the win, I didn't wreck him, and just raced him hard. He left a hole. Everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you're supposed to go for it,' said Keselowski, who appeared to be spitting blood after the post-race brawl. 'I don't want to ruin anyone's day. I wanted to win the race and that was the opportunity. It just didn't come together.' Gordon said he was on older tires when 'out of nowhere I got slammed by the 2.' He then used an expletive in referring to Keselowski. 'The way he races, I don't know how he ever won a championship. This is why everyone is fighting with him,' Gordon said. 'There wasn't any conversation. You can't have a conversation with him. There's big consequences. To me, it's just a bunch of crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head.' He then celebrates by burning his tyres doing doughtnuts on the track after the race . It was the second time in the last four races that another driver confronted Keselowski after the checkered flag. Johnson, who beat Chase contender Kevin Harvick by a half-second, described Texas as intense and said he was sure it was 'highly entertaining.' He said he couldn't wait to go back and watch the tape. Johnson, the six-time Cup champion who was eliminated after the second round in the new Chase format, led 191 of the 341 laps. Keselowski finished third. The next-highest Chase contender was Carl Edwards in ninth and Denny Hamlin 10th. Gordon was 29th. Texas was the second consecutive race won by a driver already eliminated from title contention. That means at least three drivers will advance on points to get into the final four in the season finale at Homestead in two weeks. The third round of the Chase wraps up next week in Phoenix, where Harvick won eight months ago in the second race of the season. Kenseth and Hamlin were the only drivers of the Chase contenders to finish outside the top eight in that race.

"A member of the Gucci fashion dynasty jailed for ordering the murder of her wealthy ex-husband has refused the offer of parole – because it would mean her having to get a job. Patrizia Gucci, 62, dubbed the ‘Black Widow’, was jailed for 26 years in 1998 for arranging the death of her husband, Maurizio Gucci. Well-known for her luxury lifestyle, she once said: ‘I’d rather cry in a Rolls than be happy on a bicycle.’ Black Widow: Patrizia Gucci, pictured here in court in Milan in 1998, has rejected parole because it would mean her having to get a job . Victim: Maurizio Gucci was shot dead on the orders of his wife Patrizia as he walked into his office in Milan in 1995 . After being offered parole, Patrizia told the board at San Vittore jail: 'No thanks as it would mean getting a job and I have never worked a day in my life.' Patrizia, who is serving her sentence in the Milan jail, added: 'I would prefer to stay in my cell and water my plants.' She also said she wanted to stay inside because she wanted to take care of her pet ferret. Her decision does not come entirely as a surprise to those that know her as she once famously summed up her lavish luxury lifestyle which included apartments in Milan and St Moritz, by saying: 'I'd rather cry in a Rolls then by happy on a bicycle.' Patrizia, 63, has been allowed out for the day to visit her elderly mother Silvana and her two daughters Allegra, 29, and Alessandra, 36, at the Milan flat where the family lived when her husband was still alive. Her original trial heard how she had ordered the murder of her husband after he offered her $650,000 in a divorce settlement. She . described the offer as a 'plate of lentils', insisting she wanted at . least $1 million, and when he refused she hired hitman Benedetto . Ceraulo. Ceraulo was found guilty of pulling the trigger and given a life sentence. The hitman: Benedetto Ceraulo in handcuffs as he arrives at court in Milan in 1998 to stand trial for the murder of Maurizio Gucci. He was sentenced to life in prison . The . fashion empire of Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci, a . Florentine leather merchant whose business of selling leather travel . bags prospered after the Depression and World War Two. Guccio's son Aldo expanded the . business into Paris, New York and Tokyo as the 'twin Gs' of the family . name became a worldwide fashion icon. By 1974, the Gucci empire numbered 14 stores and 46 franchised boutiques around the world. At around the same time, . celebrities like Jackie Kennedy were helping establish Gucci as the . world's leading fashion brand by embracing its products. Maurizio Gucci, Guccio's grandson . and Aldo's nephew, took control of the company from the board of . directors after Aldo, who was sent to prison for tax evasion in 1986 . aged 81. However, Maurizio would be the last member of the family to head the Gucci business. By 1989, nearly 50 per cent of the . business had been bought out by Investcorp, a group of investment . bankers angling for shares of the business. In 1993, Maurizio sold his holding for $170m to a Bahrain-based investment company. Patrizia was furious after she discovered her husband had dumped her for a younger woman. She was found guilty of ordering 46-year-old Maurizio's death after her clairvoyant and confidante Pina Auriemma turned informer and told police about the plot. The trial captivated not only . Italians but the world and Patrizia - who arrived in court in designer . outfits every day - told the judge and jury of how she had been betrayed . by Auriemma saying: 'Never let even a friendly world into the chicken . coop. Sooner or later it will get hungry.' Seven . years ago her legal team tried to get the conviction overturned on the . grounds of her ill health, saying she had been affected by a brain . tumour - but the case fizzled out. Today . her lawyer Danilo Boungiorno said she had been offered work in a . restaurant or gym, but had turned them both down and he added: 'She . would prefer to stay in jail and make use of the weekend visits she is . granted to see her family.' The . Gucci family was one of Italy's richest and most well known 'dynasty . families', and their saga has even been turned into a TV series. Four years ago there were plans for a film about the family with . Angelina Jolie in the lead role, but the project never took off. Maurizio Gucci was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of the fashion company made famous with its double G logo. In the early 1990s it was hit by problems and he sold the label for . $120 million, just two years before his death, leaving his wife furious . at his failure to invest the money properly. Staying in: Mrs Gucci has chosen to remain inside Milan's San Vittore prison, where she wants to water her plants and care for her pet ferret .","'I have never worked a day in my life', says Patrizia Gucci after spending 13 years behind bars ."
"Sister wives disguised as ninjas tried to break into the home of a 14-year-old girl who was due to testify at their shared husband's rape trial, police have said. Raven Blackwing, 22, and Tylynn Southwick, 19, armed themselves with a knife, cellophane, matches, a screwdriver, syringes and Formalin - a chemical used to knock people out - before allegedly breaking into the girl's home in West Jordan, Utah, on Friday morning. But the two women, who say they share the same husband, were stopped by a man staying at the home when he heard the upstairs floor creaking just before 4am, the Deseret News reported. Sister wives: Raven Blackwing, left, and Tylynn Southwick, right, allegedly dressed all in black and broke into a Utah home to kidnap a 14-year-old girl who has accused their shared husband of rape . On trial: Their shared husband, Kain Blackwing, 45, is accused of raping the 14-year-old girl . When he went to investigate, he came across two people dressed all in black who lunged at him and tried to grab his throat, according to charging documents. 'I heard a creak, and there was silence for about 30 seconds,' he told FOX News 13. 'I went to the bottom of the stairs and saw a couple of ninjas coming down. They were all dark gray or black, and they had black rubber gloves on and masks. All I could see was their eyes.' He added: 'My adrenaline was pumping so bad. They grabbed for me and one of them covered my mouth, and the other grabbed my throat, but they were both pretty small so I threw them back and started shouting to get anybody awake that I could.' Another man in the home heard the noise and went to help, but Southwick allegedly went for him with a stun gun. He was able to wrestle her and pinned her down until police arrived. When cops reached the home, they also found one of the men holding Blackwing back with a samurai sword on the couch, according to the charges. The 14-year-old girl, who was asleep at the time, was set to testify against their shared husband, 45-year-old Kain Blackwing, just four days after the attack. Blackwing was charged with rape in July. Police in Utah say the attack happened near this junction in West Jordan shortly after 4am on Friday . Despite his wives' alleged attempts to reach the girl, his preliminary hearing went ahead on Tuesday and he will be back in court in November. Records show he was also convicted of aggravated assault in 2005 and sex activity with a minor in 2010. His rap sheet also shows accusations of harboring a runaway in 2008. The two women were each charged with aggravated burglary, retaliation against a witness or victim and aggravated assault. Bail was set at $1 million cash for each. Both women claim to be married to Blackwing, although Raven Blackwing is listed as his wife in court documents, while Southwick is called his girlfriend. Police do not believe the trio belong to a polygamist church.","Raven Blackwing, 22, and Tylynn Southwick, 19, 'broke into the girl's home in West Jordan, Utah on Friday armed with a knife'

"The widow of Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs is 'ready' for Hillary Clinton, and she's written a hefty check to prove it. Laurene Powell Jobs has given $25,000 to the 'Ready for Hillary' super PAC, a political campaign organization that has raised more than $4 million to lay the groundwork needed for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's expected White House run. Sharon . Elghanayan Corzine, the wife of former New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, also put $25,000 on the table. So did gay-rights philanthropist Tim Gill, who created the one-time desktop publishing software powerhouse Quark Xpress. Laurene Powell Jobs' husband, the Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs, died in 2011 -- and now she's engaging in politics by backing Hillary Clinton . Clinton is still on the fence about a presidential run, but is raking in cash by giving public speeches. On Thursday a woman was arrested after she threw a shoe at Clinton while she addressed a Las Vegas audience . Hillary uses a Blackberry, but Mrs. Jobs probably doesn't mind; her late husband helped invent the iPhone, a creation that made him a multi-billionaire . Center for American Progress fellow Glen Fukushima and former California Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez matched their donations. A source shared the list with Business Insider. At the time of his death in 2011, Steve Jobs had a massive net worth of more than $11 billion, amassed largely through the sale of iPhones, iPads, Macintosh computers, and other innovative Apple products. He and fellow tech enthusiast Steve Wozniak founded the company in 1976 in the Jobs family garage. Ready for Hillary took in more than $1.7 million between January and March, including many token $20.16 contributions. All but 2 per cent of the PAC's 32,000 donors gave less than $100. The committee set records for fundraising during its first six months of existence, only to be eclipsed months later by a committee to draft Ben Carson, the African-American conservative surgeon, into the Republican presidential primary race. Neither group has an official relationship with its preferred candidate, but the war chests will be essential of Carson and Clinton decide to take the plunge. Quark Xpress founder Tim Gill is the nation's foremost funder of gay-rights initiatives, and he's also put $25,000 behind Hillary . Federal Election Commission records show that Ready for Hillary has hauled in about $5.75 million overall, attracting the support of more than 55,000 financial donors. Nearly one-third of them donated more than once. The average contribution to the group has been slightly more than $70.00. Clinton, who was America's first lady and a U.S. senator before running the State Department during President Barack Obama's first five years in office, has hinted at running for president – but has so far announced nothing publicly. If she campaigns for the presidency, she will face difficult questions about her stewardship at Foggy Bottom before and after the 2012 terror attack that killed a U.S. ambassador in Benghazi, Libya.","Jobs was worth $11 billion when he died in 2011 .

"An alarming video of two shirtless men fighting in a street in regional Queensland has gone viral. The footage was taken in Festival Street in Rockville - in the state's south-east - and starts off with just two men in a front yard exchanging punches while onlookers stand clear of the conflict. But the incident soon escalates when a third man takes a large stick and bashes one of the men involved in the initial brawl with it. Scroll down for video . The footage was taken in Festival Street in Rockville - in the state's south-east - and has gone viral . It starts off with just two men in a front yard exchanging punches while onlookers stand clear of the conflict . The exchange becomes so heated that it soon makes its way onto the neighbour's lawn, with some witnesses pulling out smartphones to film the exchange. But it is not the first time, neighbours on Festival Street - an area with public housing - have heard of fights unfolding near their homes. Resident Sarah Giddy moved with her husband and five children to Rockville just eight months ago and told The Chronicle she had already witnessed a number of other fights in the street. 'It happens quite frequently and there are usually police here straight away,' she said. But the incident soon escalates when a third man takes a large stick and bashes one of the men involved in the initial brawl with it . The exchange becomes so heated that it soon makes its way onto the neighbour's lawn . 'They haven't done anything to us but there are other people who could get hurt.' Another resident - who wished to remain anonymous - said he had seen the fight take place on Saturday from his house. He said the street had died down in previous years but incidents of this kind were starting to pop up again. 'It is mainly the young fellows,' the man told the APN-owned newspaper.

"A photographer has created a portfolio of incredibly surreal images using a combination of raw materials, original photography and Adobe Photoshop alterations. Erik Johansson, originally from Sweden, claims to capture 'ideas' in his work. Whether using photographs and digital editing, or even paint and hand made cardboard models to re-create an imagined vision, his completed images look as though they are perfectly genuine photographs. In fact, every new image is a combination of hundreds of original photographs, sometimes with raw materials created by Mr Johansson himself, and dozens of hours spent in Adobe Photoshop to digitally alter and combine different elements to illustrate his idea. Mr Johansson writes on his website that he uses photography as a means of 'collecting material to realise the ideas in my mind'. First the image is sketched as a basic idea. He then plans what is required to create the landscape and starts identifying locations to photograph. These serve as the basis for the photo, or what he calls the 'raw material'. Any additional materials needed, such as the cardboard model and paints required for Landfall are also photographed. The final part is putting the photos together. This can take him anywhere from a few days to several weeks and he describes it as the easiest step - like putting together the pieces of a puzzle. Scroll down for video . In Mr Johansson's image Expecting Winter, a woman is photographed sewing together blankets of snow across an autumn landscape . Go Your Own Road, showing a man pulling an asphalt road across land, combines photos of a man pulling a blanket and pictures of the scene . This image, called Landfall, was created by photographing a cardboard model with paint running down it, then adding photographs of a real house and field on to it . On the left, the power lines in 'Electric Guitar' stretch up and become the strings of a guitar, while Drifting Away on the right illustrates a small town floating in a bottle .

Helping Fall (left) and Leaving Home (right) show a woman sucking leaves directly from a tree in autumn and a home with wheels driving across a field . A Diamond in the Rough: This self explanatory image shows a giant diamond that appears to have come to a stop after carving through a field . Question Architecture, on the left, carries a obvious message about modern architecture, while Vertical Turn on the right, shows a surreal looking pathway dropping vertically as though it is a natural cliff edge . This image, showing a woman vomiting milk onto her breakfast partner, is titled Vanlig frukost, which is Swedish for 'regular breakfast' In this bizarre picture called Zip City, tractors pull a zip closed and in doing so connect two layers of grey urban buildings over a green landscape . A second image using zips or scissors, called Cut & Fold, shows fields being peeled apart by a pair of painted scissors . Roadworkers Coffee Break, which shows a digger carving a noughts and crosses game on the road, is a surreal picture but one which could easily pass off as genuine . Downside of the Upside, which Mr Johansson made in 2009, is an illusion showing two people impossibly standing on opposite sides of the same bridge .

"George Osborne last night attacked European judges after they backed a ‘perverse’ EU cap on bankers’ bonuses. The Chancellor had mounted a legal challenge to the cap but the European Court of Justice, ruled the curbs were ‘valid’ and legal. The judgment triggered a furious reaction, with the EU accused of attacking the City of London and riding roughshod over Britain’s right to manage its own economy. Chancellor George Osborne had mounted a legal challenge to the cap but the European Court of Justice, ruled the curbs were ‘valid’ and legal . Mr Osborne insisted the Brussels plan for a cap on bonuses would prove counterproductive because banks would simply pay higher salaries, which could not be clawed back if things go wrong – unlike bonuses. But he has now withdrawn his challenge, saying: ‘I am not going to spend taxpayers’ money on a legal challenge now unlikely to succeed.’ In a letter to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney he described the ruling as ‘self-defeating’, saying it could ‘undermine responsibility in the banking system rather than promote it’ by encouraging higher salaries. The ruling by Niilo Jaaskinen, the court’s Advocate General, would make it ‘more difficult to ensure that the banks and bankers pay when there are mistakes, rather than the taxpayer’, he said. The cap, enforced at the beginning of the year, restricts banks to paying a maximum bonus of one year’s salary, rising to twice salary if shareholders approve. Although the final decision will be made by the Court of Justice early next year, it rarely goes against the Advocate’s decision. The judgment triggered a furious reaction, with the EU accused of attacking the City of London and riding roughshod over Britain’s right to manage its own economy . Mr Osborne came under fire from Ukip, with Tory defector Douglas Carswell claiming his pledge to renegotiate a better deal with the EU had ‘all the credibility of a Greek government bond’. The lavish bankers’ bonus culture has been widely blamed for driving the reckless behaviour that ultimately caused the banking sector to implode. Britain’s concerns have already been vindicated, with UK banks dodging the bonus cap by paying their top staff seven-figure ‘fixed allowances’ to increase their basic packages. Banks have also warned the bonus cap will prompt talented staff to join Asian and US rivals, putting financial services at a disadvantage. The Treasury launched a legal challenge in September, arguing that the EU had no legal right to introduce pay curbs. Mr Jaaskinen admitted that setting the level of pay was ‘unquestionably a matter for the member states’, but added: ‘Fixing the ratio of variable remuneration to basic salaries does not equate to a “cap on bankers’ bonuses”, or “fixing the level of pay” because there is no limit imposed on the basic salaries that the bonuses are pegged against.’ Critics said the bonus cap will mean bankers get paid more even if they perform badly. Tory Mark Garnier said: ‘The investment banking industry is critical to the UK economy. It is vital that we – not meddling bureaucrats from Brussels – control how it is run.’ But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said it was ‘a humiliating climbdown’ for Mr Osborne.","EU Court of Justice’s legal adviser threw out the Government's challenge .

"Unchained: Meriam Ibrahim, the mother-of-two facing the death sentence in Sudan for becoming a Christian, was released from jail today . The woman who gave birth in a Sudanese jail after she was sentenced to death for converting to Christianity has had her shackles removed, her lawyer has said. Meriam Ibrahim's chains were removed on doctor's orders after she gave birth to a daughter in jail in Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman. She was also moved from the prison cell she shared with other inmates to a prison clinic with a bed and air conditioning, her lawyer told AFP. The case of the 27-year-old mother of two sparked an international outcry when a judge sentenced her to hang last month after she was found guilty of apostasy and adultery for marrying a Christian. Born to a Muslim father, she was convicted under Islamic sharia law that has been in force in Sudan since 1983 and outlaws conversions on pain of death. She gave birth just 12 days after the verdict. It had been thought she was still shackled throughout the delivery and beyond, according to the rules which stipulate the treatment of death row inmates in Sudan. But Mohanad Mustafa, one of Ms Ibrahim's lawyers, told AFP yesterday that jailers removed the chains after she gave birth to her daughter. 'This is on order by the doctor,' he said, adding that he didn't think the shackled would be put back on again. 'After she gave birth the conditions got better,' said Mr Mustafa. 'She has air conditioning. She has a good bed,' he said after he and Ms Ibrahim's Catholic husband, Daniel Wani, visited her. 'She's fine. Usually her husband brings the food, and he gives her money' to buy any other items she needs. The couple's 20-month-old son is also in prison with Ms Ibrahim and her daughter. Mr Mustafa said that despite the relative improvement in the conditions they are being kept in, 'a prison is a prison.' Western governments and human rights groups have pressured the Sudanese to relase Ms Ibrahim. Last week, European Union leaders called for revocation of the 'inhumane verdict,' while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged Khartoum to repeal its laws banning Muslims from converting. Prime Minister David Cameron said the way she has been treated 'is barbaric and has no place in today's world.' Mr Mustafa and four other human rights lawyers handling her case for free have appealed the verdict. 'We're still waiting,' and there is no word on when the higher court's decision may come, Mr Mustafa said. A church source was optimistic Ms Ibrahim would be freed because of international pressure on Sudan. 'I am hopeful that she will be released,' said the source, who asked for anonymity. But Muslim extremist groups have been also obbying the Islamist government over the case, prominent newspaper editor Khalid Tigani has said. Daniel Wani, Ms Ibrahim's Catholic husband, with their daughter: The couple's 20-month-old son is also jailed . Ms Ibrahim, born in eastern Sudan's Gedaref state on November 3, 1987, is the daughter of a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian mother, according to a statement from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum. The aid group Doctors Without Borders says an aerial bombing run over a Sudanese village hit one of its medical facilities, partially destroying a hospital. The group said Tuesday the bombing run in the southern Sudanese region of South Kordofana occurred Monday. The group said five people from the village and one Doctors Without Borders staffer were wounded. The group's head of mission, Brian Moller, said the group is shocked that its medical facility was hit, especially since it is clearly identified with a flag and a cross on the roof. He said Khartoum's government knows where the hospital is. Residents in the region say the Khartoum government has increased bombing runs in recent weeks. Sudan's military is fighting soldiers more ideologically aligned with South Sudan. Her father abandoned the family when she was five, and she was raised according to her mother's faith, it says. 'She has never been a Muslim in her life,' said the statement signed by Father Mussa Timothy Kacho, episcopal vicar for Khartoum. Miss Ibrahim joined the Catholic church shortly before she married the Mr Wani in December 2011, the vicar said. Mr Wani was born in Khartoum but is now a U.S. citizen, the U.S. embassy confirmed to AFP on Tuesday. The case against Ishag dates from 2013 when 'a group of men who claim to be Meriam's relatives' filed an initial legal action, the vicar's statement said. In fact, she had never seen those men before, the statement added, in comments confirmed by Mr Mustafa. Ms Ibrahim, who is a trained doctor, and her husband own a barber shop, a mini-mart and an agricultural project in Gedaref, the vicar said. Mr Mustafa did not know if there is a link between the businesses and the case against Ms Ibrahim, but he told AFP: 'Surely there is something behind this'. The case is the latest problem facing Sudan, an impoverished nation battling rebellions in its west and south, while more than six million people need humanitarian aid.","Meriam Ibrahim, 27, has also been moved from her cell to a prison clinic .

"The parents of a British hotelier murdered by a hitman on the Caribbean island of St Lucia have put up a £60,000 reward in a last ditch attempt to try and find his killers. The badly burnt body of 38-year-old Oliver Gobat was found on the idyllic island in April. He had been shot twice in the head while sitting in the passenger seat of his Range Rover before the vehicle - with his body inside it - was torched. But the local police investigation into the suspected contract killing has now stalled and British police are refusing to assist because the Commonwealth country of St Lucia retains the death penalty for murder. The murder of Briton Oliver Gobat (pictured left with his sister-in-law Alexandra See) is thought to have been carried out by a contract killer after the businessman ruffled feathers within the criminal underworld . Mr Gobat's parents Theo and Helen Gobat have responded by launching a private investigation headed by a former member of of the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency, The Times reported. Mrs Gobat said: 'Getting justice for Ollie is like pushing water uphill. Unless we get an outside police force in, we face a big challenge. 'I'd like to see the evil people who brought this upon Ollie brought to justice, for our sake, for Ollie's sake and for St Lucia's sake.' The couple now live under constant security protection, and are offering a £60,000 reward for leads or information on their son's death, the paper reported. The manner of Mr Gobat’s death, on a remote track a mile from the upmarket Cap Maison hotel he ran in the north of the island, has led police to believe he was the victim of a contract killing. Police sources previously stated Mr Gobat’s death was ‘no ordinary murder’ and it had ‘all the hallmarks of a professional killing’. As the family's investigation has been subjected to intimidation and death threats, it's now considered Mr Gobat's business dealings had caused problems within the Caribbean's criminal underworld, leading to his death. Multi-millionaire Oliver Gobat, 38, was shot twice in the head before being doused with petrol and set alight in his Range Rover (pictured) A theory previously considered by police is that money he was using to finance a new hotel development came from a drugs gang who were using the legitimate business to launder their cash. When that deal failed to materialise, they demanded their money back. Mr Gobat was unable to pay so they had him killed. Cap Maison, a five-star boutique hotel set in the lush tropical grounds of a former sugar plantation on the northern tip of the island, was created by the Gobats with their three sons Rufus, Adam and Oliver. Paradise: Cap Maison's estate of luxury apartments and hotel in the Caribbean once run by Mr Gobat . Guests, who have included Amy Winehouse and Kelly Brook, stay in colonial-style villas and every luxury is on tap, including valets, private chefs, a walk-in wine cellar and spa. Theo Gobat, 75, was born in Chester and trained as an accountant and moved to St Lucia in 1974 as finance director of a hotel and travel company which then went bankrupt. He and another director successfully took over the company’s hotels and eventually created the small, upmarket Cap Maison. His son Oliver was born in St Lucia but had dual nationality. He represented Surrey juniors at cricket and attended Leeds University, before moving to Australia to help launch a health and fitness club in Adelaide, Australia. The boutique hotel, pictured, is five star and is based on the coast of the island .","Oliver Gobat's parents claim British government refuses to work on case .

"New measures: Immigrants will be forced to pay to visit a GP . Immigrants will be forced to pay to visit a GP and be banned from getting council houses for up to five years after they settle in Britain. The moves, to be signalled by David Cameron this week, mark a new hardline stance on immigration aimed at reviving Tory fortunes. The Prime Minister intends to introduce legislation on both issues in the next few months, despite the likelihood of strong opposition from Labour MPs. The measures are to be rushed through to stop Bulgarians and Romanians being allowed free access to the UK next January. A . senior source said: ‘The PM wants the immigration system to back people . who work hard and do the right thing. He is determined to bring an end . to the situation where people can come to the UK and get benefits and . public services without putting anything in. ‘He . is opposed to the “something for nothing” culture of some people who . come here from abroad and jump the housing queue of deserving local . families who have lived in an area for years and paid taxes. ‘We want to remove any expectation that new migrants can expect the taxpayer to give them a home on arrival.’ Earlier . this month, Nick Clegg chaired a Home Affairs Cabinet Committee to . examine plans  to deter EU migrants from coming to Britain by slashing . benefits without breaching discrimination laws. They examined options to restrict access to housing and welfare, and introducing an ‘entitlement card’ for all EU citizens. The Prime Minister, right, intends to introduce legislation on both issues in the next few months. Nick Clegg, right, chaired a Home Affairs Cabinet Committee to examine plans to deter EU migrants from coming to Britain . Health . Secretary Jeremy Hunt is also looking at proposals to restrict access . to services by introducing a tighter ‘habitual residency test’. At . the same time, the Home Office has been examining ways to bar migrants . from Romania and Bulgaria from using NHS hospitals if they come to . Britain without a job. People . who have lived in the UK for the past year can get free treatment at . hospitals, while those who are here for a shorter time are charged. However, foreign patients can use GPs’ surgeries without charge. The Government review has looked at whether the system applied by hospitals should be extended to GPs. Doctors’ leaders have suggested that Ministers should introduce a system under which patients who cannot provide proof of residence have to pay for treatment. However, the British Medical Association has advised its members not to make any checks on residency because ‘there is no obligation on them to do so’ – and it could leave them open to allegations of  discrimination. Halted: The measures are to be rushed through to stop Bulgarians and Romanians being allowed free access to the UK next January . They have called on ‘other  bodies’ within the health service to make judgments about someone’s eligibility for care  to avoid putting doctors in a  difficult position. GP practices have been placed under a growing burden by the requirement to provide free emergency treatment and immediate necessary treatment for up to 14 days to any person within their practice area. EU citizens from outside the UK have the same rights to free NHS treatment as British residents when they take up residence here, either as temporary migrant workers or as permanent residents. At the same time, nearly one in ten council houses and ‘social housing’ go to foreign nationals, a 30 per cent rise in four years. The new rules are intended to force town halls to introduce a ‘local residency test’ before letting families join the list for a council home. They will have to wait a minimum of two and a maximum of five years to join the list, depending on the availability of houses. Local authorities are currently free to impose such restrictions, but many choose not to.","Mark a new hardline stance on immigration aimed at reviving Tory fortunes .

"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he had no confidence in the figures, insisting no one knows how many migrants will flock to Britain . The number of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants expected when the UK opens its doors next January was put at just 12,700, according to long-hidden figures. The total, compiled under the Labour government, was  immediately rejected as ‘ridiculous’ by senior Coalition figures. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the estimates, revealed yesterday after months of cover-up by ministers, were drawn up by Labour after comparing the two countries to Poland, which has sent around one million people to the UK. The document predicts just 4,613 Bulgarians, out of a population of 7.5million, will come to Britain every year, along with 8,156 Romanians – a tiny fraction of its 21.4million inhabitants. Addressing Westminster journalists, Mr Pickles said he had ‘no confidence’ in the figures and that was why ministers chose not to publicise them, though he said they were slipped out on a Whitehall website in 2011. The total of 12,769 is very  similar to the 13,000 Labour ministers claimed would come to the UK in 2004, when immigration restrictions were lifted on Poland and nine other Eastern European countries. In the event, more than a million people have flocked to Britain from Poland alone over the last nine years. Mr Pickles revealed that the research existed in a television interview in January, but immigration minister Mark Harper refused to release the study, saying it would not be ‘helpful’. The Home Office had even sought to claim that no such estimates existed. Yesterday Mr Pickles said: ‘These are calculations. I don’t have any confidence in them whatsoever.’ He added that he doesn’t know how many immigrants will come to the UK in January but hopes it will be lower than in 2004, when many other EU countries refused to lift restrictions at the same time as Britain. Ministers are drawing up a package of emergency measures to deter Romanian and Bulgarian migrants from flocking to Britain when limits are lifted next year . He said: ‘Last time, we, Ireland and Sweden opened up our boundaries, when France and Germany and Spain didn’t  open up their boundaries, so a  disproportionately large number of Poles came to the UK. ‘This time everyone is opening up at the same time. If you combine Romania and Bulgaria they don’t even meet the level of the Polish population.’ He added: ‘Bulgarians and Romanians have a link with Spain and with France.’ The campaign group Migration Watch UK has estimated up to 75,000 Romanians and Bulgarians could enter the UK a year. Commenting on the figures, chairman . Sir Andrew Green said: ‘We regard the estimate as much too low and agree . with Mr Pickles that it is not a sufficient basis for policy. ‘For a start it ignores the two . million Romanians in Spain and Italy, many of whom are now unemployed . and might move to Northern Europe.’ Mr Pickles added: ‘No matter how many fancy calculations you can make, I don’t know. The truth is nobody really knows. ‘All the government can do is be . careful about pull factors that might range from the health service to . housing and benefits to try to ensure there isn’t an extra attraction to . come here.’ Ministers are making plans to require . new immigrants to register to use public services or claim benefits. The Government is also considering sending home those who fail to find . work. Minister for local government Brandon Lewis denied there had been a cover-up. He said: ‘We have been open and transparent in publishing research . . . ‘This analysis was produced by the . last administration, and should be treated with extreme caution given . how unreliable their statistics have been historically.’","Formula suggests 4,613 Bulgarians and 8,155 Romanians will head to UK .

"A grieving mother is trying to raise awareness of male domestic abuse after her son was brutally murdered by the 'psychotic' girlfriend he loved. Michelle Mills, 31, from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, was jailed last year for stabbing Eddie Miller, 20, to death. She stabbed him 24 times in the front and back with a kitchen knife in an attack that . was so forceful, she snapped the blade. Scroll down for video . Missed: Sara with her son Eddie who was brutally murdered by his girlfriend last year . Now Eddie's mother, Sara Westle, has spoken of her heartache at losing her son in such horrific circumstances. 'I would describe her as a monster. I understand that there weren't what they call defence wounds on his hands. I don't want to think about it,' she said. Mills and Eddie had been together for two years after meeting through friends and had a volatile relationship. Sara said she knew the pair often argued but she never believed petite blonde Mills would be capable of murder. But the mother-of-two had suffered a troubled childhood, was a heavy drug user . and had mental health issues. Eddie, who was a college student taking a course in hotel management, knew of her troubled past and was determined to help her. Sara adds that he was also flattered that a more experienced, older woman was interested in dating him. Showed no remorse: Michelle Mills pleaded not guilty to murder after stabbing Eddie 24 times and then waiting 20 minutes to call the emergency services . 'He was definitely smitten. You could see the twinkle in his eyes that he was excited,' said Sara of her son when he first started his relationship with Mills. However, his friends did not take to his new girlfriend. 'My first impression was she was just strange,' says Dylan Rocket, a close friend of Eddie's. 'She'd say inappropriate things.' He added: . 'She was such a handful, and I used to feel so sorry for Eddie.' As Eddie and Mills' relationship progressed, she began to become more possessive and tried to stop him seeing his friends. Sara recalls: 'It was okay for her to go out with . her friends and have a laugh, have a drink, do whatever girlies do. That was okay. But it was like a rule for one but not for the other.' Then Mills' behaviour started to become violent. Sara said: 'There were times when Eddie would stay . over and she would kick him out in the early hours of the morning. He . would come home with his face scratched or a black eye. 'I said, ""What happened?"" He said that they got into a row and she just went berserk.' Eddie's friends and family tried to persuade him to end his relationship with Mills.  'I often did say to him, ""Are you sure you . want to be in this relationship? And do you not think it's wise to take . a break?""' Sara said. 'But he'd say, ""No I want to help her, I want to support her. She hasn’t had it easy and she is facing up to her demons"". He wanted . to be the rock in her life.' Dylan added: 'He genuinely thought that he could help her work through her issues.' Eddie and Mills moved into a rented cottage together in the village of Scalford, Leicestershire, in the summer of 2012. Their neighbour, Geri Paynter, said she often heard them having blazing rows. 'You don't expect someone 4ft 11, slim, attractive blonde, living next door to you, to turn out to be a killer' She said: 'They would argue on a regular basis, . sometimes it was once a week, sometimes every ten days. It never went as . long as two weeks without an argument.' But like Eddie's friends and family, she never believed the arguments would escalate to murder. She said: 'What does a murderer look like? You don't expect someone 4ft 11, slim, attractive blonde, living next door to you, to turn out to be a killer.' Police were called to Mills' home in the early hours of the 6th November 2012 where they found Eddie bleeding to death. After one of their usual rows, Mills had armed herself with a kitchen knife and stabbed Eddie 24 times as he sat on the sofa. Shocked: Sara never thought Mills would be capable of murder . Paramedics battled to save his life but he died in hospital. Mills was arrested and charged with murder but pleaded not guilty claiming she had acted in self defence. But her neighbour Geri didn't buy her story for a second. 'I think if you stab someone 24 times you damn well mean them to be dead,' she said. And chillingly, it transpired that Mills had waited 20 minutes before calling the emergency services, precious time that could have saved Eddie's life. Dr Keri Nixon explains in the documentary: 'I believe she planned to kill him, and I believe that in those 20 minutes she knew he was dying, and she let him die. At the point that he was lying on the floor, she could have got help. Eddie didn't die immediately. Paramedics battled to save his life. If he'd had 20 minutes of additional help there's a chance he could have survived.' Smitten: Eddie had wanted to help Mills through her problems. The mother-of-two has been jailed for life . Eddie's friend Dylan said it was this that shocked him the most. 'That's something that a serial killer does, someone who's really quite twisted, psychotic, would do that, would watch their loved one die,' he said. He added that even though Mills and Eddie had a volatile relationship, he didn't believe Eddie's death was a 'crime of passion'. He explains: 'Had someone told me that it was a killing of passion, and I said to them you're talking s*** because killing of passion is when you feel passionate about something that moment, and once you realise what you've done you sort of think that you snap out of it. 'You're like, ""What have I done? What have I done?"" And you will do anything in your power to rectify it, and you will show remorse, that's a killing of passion. 'You didn't mean to do it, and you let the whole world know that you didn't mean to do it. But she didn't do that. She sat there and she watched him die.' 'You were extremely angry with him and . you were in a rage. He did not realistically stand a chance of defending . himself such was the ferocity of the attack' He added that Mills trying to make out Eddie had attacked her first was a further insult. 'The fact that she tried to tarnish his name is disgusting, it goes without saying that he wouldn’t do that. He's not like that. He's just not that kind of person,' he said of Eddie, who was known by many as a 'gentle giant.' A jury at Lincoln Crown Court didn't believe Mills' protests of innocence either when she appeared in court a year ago. Judge Michael Heath passed a life sentence on Mills, ordering her to serve a minimum of 15 years. He said: 'This was a brutal, ferocious and sustained attack. You loved each other but you were jealous of each other. 'You were extremely angry with him and you were in a rage. He did not realistically stand a chance of defending himself such was the ferocity of the attack. 'I detect no remorse in you. You have only been concerned with yourself. You did your very best to hoodwink the jury but they saw through you. 'Throughout this trial you have tried to portray yourself as a serial victim of domestic violence, that picture is not an accurate one.' Dylan said Eddie's friends and family are now struggling to come to terms with their loss. 'She doesn't realise what she's taken away for everyone,' he explains. 'She doesn’t realise the hole that she's left in people's lives, especially his mum. That's someone you can never replace. He's got a place in my heart and he always will have.' Sara added: 'I feel robbed and stripped. I miss him terribly.' But she doesn't want her son's death to be in vain so she is now working to raise the often overlooked issue of male domestic violence. Dylan explains: 'She wants to turn something that's negative into something that's positive to help other people, and that's just where Eddie gets his good heart and kind nature from, his mum.'

"Start racing along at more than three times the speed limit and you might expect the police to come after you. What you might not expect is to get anywhere near to three times the speed limit when pedalling through the park on two wheels. But that’s exactly what happened to Radio 2 star Jeremy Vine, who was confronted by police armed with speed guns as he cycled in Hyde Park yesterday. Scroll down for video . A video of the incident posted online shows a police officer approaching Mr Vine and showing him a speed gun which indicates he was travelling too fast . He was caught zipping along at 16mph – when regulations limit cyclists to just 5mph in London’s Royal Parks. A camera on the BBC presenter’s helmet captured the moment that officers stopped him and showed him the reading on their speed gun. Vine, 49, was apologetic – but suggested that such a low speed limit puts cyclists in danger by forcing them on to roads, where they can ride faster but are far more at risk of an accident. He also complained the rule is not clearly signposted. The policeman is one of a group of officers in the busy park, suggesting the action was part of a clampdown . The star, who also presents Eggheads and Points of View, shared his video of the incident with his 260,000 followers on Twitter. His Radio 2 colleague Chris Evans quickly branded him ‘Speeding Vine’ and other social media users poked fun at police, questioning whether resources were being wasted and pointing out that 5mph is not all that much faster than the average walking speed. One Twitter user jokingly asked: ‘Are the police radar-gunning joggers as well?’ But there was also an angry backlash from pedestrians who accused Vine of behaving in a ‘dangerous’ way, and cited examples of cyclists whizzing past at great speed and almost knocking them over. Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine was stopped in Hyde Park today for cycling at 16mph in a 5mph zone . One user wrote: ‘Why should people have to dodge cycles going at three times walking pace so cycles don’t have to dodge traffic at two times cycle pace. Hypocritical?’ On his lunchtime radio show just hours after the incident, father-of-two Vine joked he was ‘off to practice cycling at 5mph’ and added: ‘I haven’t seen a radar gun for a long time so didn’t expect one with the digit 16 on it. ‘I feel embarrassed and I apologise. I didn’t see any signs. I certainly will be cycling as slow as walking pace in future.’ Earlier this year, Vine said that each morning his wife ‘says farewell in the manner of Japanese women who waved off pilot husbands in World War II’ due to the danger associated with cycling in London. Rose Downes of the London Cycling Campaign backed Vine, saying: ‘Clearly it’s important for cyclists to behave considerately around pedestrians in parks, just as it is for motorists to behave considerately around cyclists on the roads – but a 5mph speed limit is almost walking pace. ‘We’d urge the Royal Parks to review the speed limit and raise it to something more in line with the average cyclist’s speed.’ A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said the officers were in the park as part of an ‘awareness operation’, during which ‘hundreds’ of cyclists were issued with advice and leaflets explaining the law. A spokesman for Royal Parks added: ‘This wasn’t enforcement action and no penalty notices were issued – it was a gentle reminder of the need to be considerate to others.’ The latest incident comes after Mr Vine was criticised online for posting a helmet camera video of a mother crossing the road with a pram. In one of the many cycling films he has posted on Twitter, he put up a video of a mother with two children crossing the road in front of him, along with the angry message: 'Watch the pram'. But his followers hit back, suggesting the woman had the right of way as she had already started to cross when he turned onto the road. Linking to the Highway Code, one website user wrote: 'Heads up: she had right of way, rule 170.' It was the latest tweet by the star in which he expressed anger at conditions for cyclists in the capital. Earlier this month, he responded to criticism for plans for cycle 'superhighways', by tweeting: 'Oh sorry. Apparently allowing cyclists to move around the capital without dying will ""slow drivers down"".' He also tweeted a video he made of a taxi driving in front of him and added: 'Next time a taxi driver complains about “cyclists on the pavement,” I’ll politely show him this.' Mr Vine has also sent out messages calling for a change to 'Cyclists Stay Back' signs on the sides of lorries.","Radio 2 presenter stopped by police officer in Hyde Park this morning .

"Time to put the credit cards away because Jose Canseco's shot-off finger is not for sale after all. The former MLB slugger, and admitted doper, severed his left-hand middle finger last month when his handgun accidentally misfired at home while he was cleaning the firearm. Doctors reattached the digit, but last week the 50-year-old announced on Twitter that the limb had fallen off and that he planned to sell it on eBay, along with his flashy gun. Now he says the story about the finger falling off in the middle of a poker tournament was all part of an elaborate joke he devised after seeing a fake finger for sale in a Halloween shop, TMZ reports. So much for owning a piece of baseball history. Scroll down for video . Off the market: Jose Canseco (left) tweeted last week that his finger, recently reattached after a gun accident, had fallen off. He has since told TMZ that the finger never fell off. Pictured above with fiancée Leila Knight (right) Canseco had sports fans gearing up to start a bidding war last week when he wrote a series of prank tweets, saying he was going to sell his finger and gun. 'I will soon put the finger that fell off in the poker tournament on eBay for sale,' Canseco tweeted Monday night. 'The eBay ad will read slightly used middle finger with 462 home runs could be used as a stirring straw for drinks,' he joked. Canesco went on to offer the finger as a package deal, with the 45-caliber Remington gun that shot it off on October 29. However, there were signs that it was a joke then since firearms and human remains are not allowed to be sold on eBay. Canseco's lighthearted attitude about the painful injury is marked change from last month, when he broke down in tears about the incident to Inside Edition. Describing what happened, he said: 'At first I heard it go off and I actually grabbed the gun and put it on the table. '(I) thought nothing had happened. Then I look at my hand and my finger’s blown off.' Canseco explained the bullet only narrowly missed his fiancée, swimwear model Leila Knight, who was standing nearby. She quickly ran to his aid. 'I was telling Jose not to look at his hand because he kept saying that he felt nauseous and said he was going to pass out,' Knight told Inside Edition. Accident: The former MLB star, who admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during his long career, accidentally shot off his left-hand middle finger last month while cleaning his handgun at home in Las Vegas. Pictured on the left in July 2013, and on the right playing for the Oakland Athletics in 1992 . Knight wrapped his hand in a towel and called 911. 'I’m just glad nothing happened to her (Knight),' Canseco said. 'If it’s a lesson having to lose a finger, so be it.' Knight said her fiancée had been at a shooting range a few days earlier. He then decided to clean the weapon but didn't realize it was still loaded. 'The middle finger was hanging by a thread, and I wrapped his hand in a towel and then called 911,' Knight told the newspaper. 'He blew away an artery and a big bone chunk.' The Cuban-American dominated the MLB with his hitting prowess in the 1980s, but later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs for much of his career. Canseco is a right-handed batter who hit 462 career home runs and was a six-time All-Star. He also played for Texas, Boston, Toronto, Tampa Bay, the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox during a career that spanned from 1985 to 2001. It could have been much worse: In an emotional interview last month, Canseco described how the bullet almost hit his fiancée Leila. The couple seen above in a picture posted to Leila's Instagram on November 19 .","Jose Canseco accidentally shot off the middle finger on his left hand last month while cleaning his handgun .

"Jay-Z raised eyebrows at the Barclay's Center last week when he wore a medallion symbolizing the Five Percent Nation. The Brooklyn-born rapper was sitting court-side at a Nets game on Tuesday with wife Beyonce when he was snapped wearing the controversial symbol. One of the core tenants of the Five Percent Nation - an off-shoot of the Nation of Islam - is that white people are 'wicked and inferior' to black men. Fashion choice: Rapper Jay-Z turned heads at the Brooklyn Nets game on Tuesday when he wore a Five Percent Nation medallion . Race game: The Five Percent Nation is an offshoot of the Nation of Islam and one of the core tenants is that white people are 'weak' and 'inferior' to black men who hold the power of God. On the left, a zoomed in view of Jay-Z's medallion compared to the group's official symbol on the right . When asked by a reporter whether the medallion is meaningful to him, Jay-Z shrugged and said 'A little bit'. This isn't the first time that the rapper has been connected to the Five-Percenters. He was photographed wearing another similar medallion while giving radio interviews for his album Magna Carta Holy Grail last summer. And in 'Heaven' a track on that album, Jay-Z references the Five-Percenters acronym for Allah by rapping 'Arm leg leg arm head'. The Five Percent Nation was founded in 1963 by Clarence Smith, a former student of Malcolm X. But Smith decided to split off from the Nation of Islam after disagreeing over the idea of God. Early days: The Five Percent Nation was founded in 1963 as an offshoot of the Nation of Islam by Clarence Smith of Harlem . The Five Percent Nation was founded by Harlem, New York native Clarence Smith in 1963. Smith was originally a student of Malcom X, leader of the Nation of Islam, but split from the movement because he didn't agree with their definition of God. Followers of the Nation of Islam believe that founder Wallace Fard Muhammad is God, but Smith doesn't agree since he believes that God can only be 'purely black' and Muhammad was bi-racial. Smith, who changed his name to Allah, also believe that God wasn't a supernatural being, but something found in all black men. Black women did not possess God, according to his beliefs, but were subordinates of black men. Still they hold a higher position that all white people who are considered 'weak, wicked and inferior' according to Michael Muhammad Knight, who was written two books on the group. The Five-Percenters get their name from the idea that only five per cent of humanity known the truth about existence and are 'poor righteous teachers' trying to tell the rest of the world the truth . Another 10 per cent also know the truth but propagate a belief in a 'mystery God' to the ignorant 85 per cent. Clarence Smith died in 1969 after being murdered in his Harlem housing project. The Five-Percenters continue today with many followers in the rap world. Busta Rhymes, the Wu-Tang Clan and Lord Jabar of Brand Nubian are all noted adherents. Smith . didn't believe that God was a supernatural being, but rather something . found in every black man (black women do not have God in them and are . considered subordinates, but still hold a higher standing than white . people). Which . means he disagreed with the Nation of Islam's belief that founder . Wallace Fard Muhammad was God since Muhammad was bi-racial and not . 'purely black'. 'The . rationale is that the black man is God and created the universe, and is . physically stronger and intellectually stronger and more righteous . naturally,' author Michael Muhammad Knight told the New York Post. 'Whiteness is weak and wicked and inferior — basically just an errant child who needs to be corrected.' Knight, . a white converted Muslim, has written two books on the the . Five-Percenters and told Vice: 'The first lesson I learned from the Five . Percent was simple. F*** white people. White people are devils'.

Jay-Z isn't the only rapper that has taken up the Five Percent cause. Busta Rhymes, Wu Tang Clan and Lord Jabar of Brand Nubian are all noted followers. But a representative for the group's upstate region told the Post that they are not happy with Jay-Z flaunting their symbol. 'Jay .

Keepers say the baby seems to be 'strong' and is already forming a bond with his mother. A gorilla mother is very protective of her babies and will carry them on her chest for the first three months. The infant will then move to ride on its mother's back at around six months old and begin playing on the ground close by.

"Residents of Dale Farm, the UK's largest illegal travellers' site, lost their High Court battle against eviction today. The travellers, who have vowed to lodge another appeal, said that they will stand their ground and cannot be moved until Monday at the earliest . They attempted to block their removal from the controversial site near Basildon, Essex, in three linked applications for judicial review. The decision means officials will finally be able to evict hundreds of travellers living illegally at the site since 2005 after a legal battle estimated to have cost £18m. The picnic's over: Dale Farm residents, and sisters, Margaret, Maria, Nora and Kathleen McCarthy sit and drink tea outside the High Court on Friday . Day in court: Tony Ball, leader of Basildon Council which is attempting to evict the travellers, arrives at the High Court on Friday . However this afternoon Mr Justice Ouseley, . sitting in London, ruled they had delayed too long in challenging . Basildon Council's decision to take direct action against them. He said the travellers were breaking criminal law on a daily basis by remaining on the site and their removal was necessary to avoid 'the criminal law and the planning system being brought into serious disrepute.' The judge said: 'It is the residents of Dale Farm who have to comply with the obligation to leave voluntarily. 'If the removal becomes forcible it would be because of decisions made by the residents not to comply.' Dismissing all the arguments, the judge observed they had been properly taken into account in many legal actions over the years. The judge said he recognised that the removal of the travellers was going to cause 'considerable distress and disruption - but in my judgment the time has manifestly come for steps to enforce the law to be taken'. Mr Justice Ouseley, whose ruling lasted more than three hours, said: 'The conclusion has been reached time and again that this is just the wrong site for travellers.' The planning system had always included a 'fair consideration' of 'personal circumstances'. He added: 'The Dale Farm residents have had that, but they have lost.' The judge said: 'The criminal law applies equally to all - travellers and others alike.' Support: Residents have created a Save Dale Farm! message using paper close to the site . Dispute: The Dale Farm site has become a target for protesters who sympathise with the travellers . Candy Sheridan, vice-chair of the Gypsy Council, said: 'We are disappointed. We are not surprised but the fight goes on. We will be seeking permission to appeal.' Another resident, Jake Fulton said outside the gates of the site that families were 'oo distraught' to speak after they lost their Hbattle. 'People are already flooding back, both travellers and supporters,' Mr Fulton told reporters. 'We are expecting a big swell over the next couple of days and we'll be ready for when they come.' He added: 'Of course we are going to try and appeal this decision but we don't know what's going to happen there. 'At the end of the day we will be here for them and we'll have to rely on the physical defences now that the legal ones have failed us.' Basildon Council has been fighting to remove the travellers since 2005, but a judge gave them a stay of execution last week. The residents triumphantly declared they would be still be living there in 30 years. The 86 families who face eviction argued that they should not be removed because the land they bought in 2001 was being used as a scrapyard. Their lawyers had argued the council's decision earlier this year to take direct action to clear the land was in breach of their human rights and unreasonable. Or will you? The travellers now face removal by bailiffs if they refuse to leave the land . They also argued there had been a failure to offer residents suitable alternative accommodation and to take account of vulnerable residents, including the sick in need of regular medication and children whose schooling would be disrupted if families were evicted. Basildon Council said only a small part of the farm was being used as a scrapyard and it has always hoped to return it to green-belt status. Pleased: Basildon Council Leader Tony Ball arrives at the High Court yesterday, and said after the verdict that he took 'quiet satisfaction' from it . Some critics have condemned the court battle as a 'farce', which could cost in the region of £18million. One of the applications has been brought by Mary Sheridan, who claims being evicted would be a breach of her human rights. Although Basildon Council has said the travellers can apply for accommodation, her barrister Marc Willers argued that it had an ‘obligation to facilitate the gipsy way of life’. Mr Willers said the case had an 'extensive history' but Ms Sheridan was not claiming she should be allowed to stay at Dale Farm 'forever - or indeed for many years, or even a year'. Basildon Council's leader Tony Ball said tonight: 'This is not a day for triumphalism, but I do take quiet satisfaction on behalf of local people that in all matters the council has been found to have acted lawfully. 'The residents of the illegal settlement at Dale Farm have now had their day in court. For almost three weeks every aspect of the council's decision to clear Dale Farm has been scrutinised in great detail and our position has been upheld. 'As for the travellers - having engaged with the legal system they must now abide by the law. 'I would like to reflect on what the judge said that the criminal law applies equally to all, travellers and others alike. They have reached the end of the road. I would therefore urge them to do two things. 'Firstly I would ask them to see that their supporters stand down and preferably leave the site. If they have the travellers' best interests at heart they will do this. There is now nothing to be gained by their continued resistance and certainly not if it involves violence and other forms of law breaking as some have suggested. 'Secondly I hope the travellers will now comply with the court's ruling and leave Dale Farm in a peaceful and orderly manner. 'I strongly urge the travellers not to return to the path of unlawful resistance. 'It is too early yet to say exactly when the site clearance will begin. That will be a decision for the officers and our partners, such as the police, and will primarily depend upon how quickly all the necessary resources can be put back in place so it can be done safely.'","Travellers vow to appeal again and cannot be evicted until Monday .

"Lack of vitamin D increases the chances of men at high risk of prostate cancer being diagnosed with an aggressive and potentially deadly form of the disease, a study has found. The link is so strong that scientists believe blood levels of the vitamin could provide a way of screening patients. 'Vitamin D deficiency could be a biomarker of advanced prostate tumour progression in large segments of the general population,' said lead scientist Dr Adam Murphy, from Northwestern University in the US. The study found that American men of European origin were 3.66 times more likely to have aggressive prostate cancer if they were vitamin D deficient . 'More research is needed, but it would be wise for men to be screened for vitamin D deficiency and treated.' The scientists examined data from a wide-ranging group of more than 600 men from the Chicago area who had risk factors for prostate cancer, such as raised levels of the blood marker Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) or a family history of the disease. Each man was screened for vitamin D deficiency before having a sample of his prostate removed for analysis. The biopsy samples showed that lacking vitamin D was strongly associated with aggressive forms of prostate cancer, even after adjusting for influences such as diet, smoking habits, obesity, family history and calcium intake. Scientists examined data from a wide-ranging group of more than 600 men from the Chicago area who had risk factors for prostate cancer, such as a family history of the disease . American men of European origin were 3.66 times more likely to have aggressive prostate cancer if they were vitamin D deficient. For those of African origin, lacking vitamin D increased the risk 4.22 times. African-Americans with severe vitamin D deficiency were also more than twice as likely as those with normal levels of the vitamin to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. The findings are published in the latest edition of the journal Clinical Cancer Research. Dr Murphy said: 'Vitamin D deficiency is more common and severe in people with darker skin and it could be that this deficiency is a contributor to prostate cancer progression among African-Americans. 'Our findings imply that vitamin D deficiency is a bigger contributor to African-American prostate cancer. 'It is a good idea to get your (vitamin D) levels checked on a yearly basis. If you are deficient, you and your doctor can make a plan on how to reverse it through diet, supplements or other therapies.'","Study by Northwestern University in the US tested samples from 600 men .

"Haunting and beautiful, the work of poets such as Robert Graves, Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen continues to fascinate almost 100 years after the war began. But while Owen's vivid images of suffering in the trenches still strike a chord today, not every war poet is remembered quite so well. Now those poets, among them dashing Julian Grenfell and the gentle, nature-loving Edward Thomas, are to star in a new book that brings their work back to life. Dashing: Julian Grenfell (inset) wrote Into Battle, a poem that finally made it into print after his death in 1915 . In his new book, Some Desperate Glory, historian Max Egremont tells the stories of these half-forgotten poets - many of whom offered a take on war that couldn't have been more different from the miserablist approach taken by Owen. One who certainly didn't was Julian Grenfell, a glamorous Oxford-educated sportsman who served in the Royal Dragoons, a cavalry regiment. Arriving in France with the first cohort of British soldiers to go into battle, Grenfell was pleased to be there. 'French and Belgian civilians cheered Grenfell and his men, making him think that the locals were ""wonderful"",' writes Egremont. 'At first he felt lost in the fog of marching and counter-marching where ""only the virtue of the Christian faith emerges triumphant"". But ""it is all the most wonderful fun; better fun than anyone can imagine. I hope it goes on for a long time"".' Early days: British troops, Grenfell among them, were cheered by civilians when they first arrived . Hard: Despite the setbacks of Mons (pictured) and the Marne, Grenfell never lost his taste for fighting . The flowers left thick at nightfall in the wood . This Eastertide call into mind the men, . Now far from home, who, with their sweethearts, should . Have gathered them and will do never again. He later wrote that he 'adored war', describing it as a 'big picnic but without the objectiveness of a picnic'. But letters weren't all that he was writing. While serving in the British Army during the battles of the Marne, Mons and Ypres, Grenfell was also writing poetry. Unsurprisingly, Grenfell's work glories in the dirty business of fighting, describing the exhilaration of streaming over the top of the trenches and running at the German lines. His most famous work, Into Battle, was even published in the Times the year it was written. Sadly for Grenfell, however, he wasn't alive to see it. Fighting in the second battle of Ypres, he was hit in the head by a splinter from a shell and died of his wounds 13 days later. He was just 27 years old. Gentle: Edward Thomas was 39 when he was killed at Arras while serving with the Royal Garrison Artillery . Brave: Thomas signed up after being sent a mocking poem by his friend, American poet Robert Frost . Unlike the more famous names who would follow him into the annals of poetry as the war continued, Grenfell never became disillusioned with war. Fellow poet Edward Thomas, however, never really wanted to be there at all, only signing up after being sent a mocking poem by his friend, the American poet Robert Frost. Thomas, a grammar-school educated writer, couldn't have been more different from the aristocratic Grenfell. A gentle man with a passion for nature, he spent most of his life in the Kent, then Gloucestershire countryside, where he lived with his wife Helen and three children. When war broke out, Thomas, then aged 36, could have avoided the draft but eventually joined the Royal Garrison Artillery in November 1916. By early 1917, Thomas was in France and serving with his unit near Arras. While he was there, he composed his heartbreaking piece, In Memoriam, a four-line poem that movingly decried the loss of millions of young men. Sadly, Thomas would become one of them. On the 9th April 1917, he was killed by the concussive blast of one of the last shells fired during the Battle of Arras. He was just 39 years old.

"Savagely beaten, stabbed and forced to participate in dog fights, the first four years of Wylie the Afghan mongrel's life were nothing short of hellish. But after being picked up by a convoy of British soldiers on the streets of Kandahar, Afghanistan, Wylie was given the veterinary care he needed before being flown to the UK. Now, two years after his arrival, he has found a loving new home, triumphed in the mongrel category at Crufts - and is the 'author' of his very own autobiography. Scroll down for video . Happy: Since arriving in Somerset, owner Sarah Singleton says he has been able to 'be a puppy again' Happy: Wylie's new life in Somerset includes regular walks, lots of cuddles and a caring new owner . Thanks to the love of new owner Sarah Singleton, 35, Wylie, who was once beaten so badly vets thought he wouldn't survive, has been transformed into a happy, confident pet who loves to play. 'His whole life has been about survival . so he never really had a chance to play and be a puppy when he was one,' she explains. 'Now the puppy in him has come out.' Born in Kandahar, Wylie, five, was just two years old when he first came to the attention of British servicemen patrolling the streets. Rescued from a crowd intent on beating him with chunks of wood, he was taken back to base where he was patched up by an Australian medic. But days after being sent back onto the streets, he was back after dog-fighters hacked off his ears, before cutting his muzzle open. Brutalised: Wylie was so badly hurt when he was first picked up, vets didn't expect him to survive . In pain: Wylie, pictured immediately after his rescue, had been stabbed and had his ears lopped off . Founded by Royal Marine Pen Farthing in 2006, NOWZAD, named after the first dog he ever rescued, specialises in rescuing and rehoming street dogs and cats in Afghanistan. Their kennel in Kabul is the country's only dog shelter and the animals who are taken in are chipped and have blood samples taken as soon as they arrive. If a home with a caring local family cannot be found, these samples are then passed on to the UK and US authorities before the animals are flown out to begin a four month quarantine period (30 days in the US). Most go on to live with the soldiers who first found them with more than 650 servicemen reunited with their Afghan pets since the charity opened. Along with the UK and US, pets have been rehomed in Germany, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and South Africa. Recent travellers include Goldi, a ginger cat sent to the US in February for a new life with the American soldier who found her, and Willy who was flown to the UK for adoption in January. For more information, see nowzad.com . He was again patched up only to return with new injuries that included a stab wound to the chest and a severed tail. Finally, after thugs threw him under a car, the Australian female soldier started planning to take him home, only to be denied a permit by the Canberra government. Luckily, Royal Marine Pen Farthing, 44, the founder of NOWZAD, a charity that has so far sent more than 550 Afghan street dogs to loving new homes in the UK and US, was able to step in. Months after being found beaten and bleeding in the streets of Kandahar, Wylie was flown to the UK and put into quarantine in a Somerset kennel. And it was there that Wylie was first introduced to the woman who would later give him a home, NOWZAD volunteer, Ms Singleton. 'I wanted to see him mainly just because of his background,' she explains. 'But he was just so trusting and so lovely - it made me almost want to go and apologise for what had happened to him.' By the time Wylie came home, he had been in quarantine for seven months and had fully recovered from his injuries - leaving him free to enjoy his new life of walks, cuddles and play with Ms Singleton's two other dogs. 'He loves sleeping and he likes jumping on tables, sitting in windows and watching the world go by - he loves being up high,' she smiles. 'He goes out for his walks and he even went to the Yeovil mayor's garden party the other day. He's a bit of a local celebrity and a lot of people come up in the street and say, ""Oh, is that Wylie?""' But with new book Wylie: The Brave Street Dog Who Wouldn't Give Up launched next week, Wylie's life is about to get busy - something Ms Singleton says she's happy to accept if it means more money for NOWZAD and more brutalised canines helped. Trusting: Despite his horrendous experiences, Sarah says Wylie still adores people, in particular, men . Winning: Wylie also triumphed in in the mongrel category at Crufts and is the subject of a new book . Proud: Sarah says she is enormously proud of Wylie, seen here with his winner's rosette . She also wants to see more support for the work done on the ground in Afghanistan where, she says, NOWZAD are working to change local attitudes towards dogs. 'It's whole . different culture,' she explains. 'It's completely different from here where we're . brought up to care for animals. 'We find it shocking but to them it is . normal. They're scared of rabies, the Taliban outlawed dogs and made it . an offence to be nice to them and the dogs are also feral: they spread . disease and stuff like that. 'NOWZAD are working hard to change that . attitude and people are starting to pick up injured dogs and puppies and . are bringing them into NOWZAD which never happened before.' As for Wylie himself, Ms Singleton says he seems none the worse for his experiences, with the only hint of his past life being an unusually high tolerance for loud noises.

"Battle: Roy Pugh, 80, is in a dispute with council officers over a ramp he wants outside his house . A disabled war veteran has been  housebound since January as he fights a  battle with council chiefs to install a ramp outside his bungalow. Roy Pugh, 80,  was left struggling to walk down his outdoor steps after a heart attack and stroke - but was repeatedly turned down for the ramp because he was using a walking frame. That meant a mobility scooter which friends from the Royal British Legion had bought him lay unused in a garage, because there was no way to get it down the stairs. It is now ten months since he last made it unaided  to the town centre in Ripley, Derbyshire, just a few hundred yards away. Mr Pugh, who served with the Army in North Korea for six years and as a reservist for nine years, claimed he was marooned by council bureaucracy. He kept pushing Derbyshire County Council, who he first contacted in February, and was eventually  able to lodge a formal application to fund the ramp in July. He had to sit on a four-month waiting list before he was finally seen last week. His bid was approved - though the funds are not yet  confirmed, and he claims he was told in the latest visit this week: 'Don't hold your breath for another eight months'. Mr Pugh said: 'I haven't been into Ripley town since January. I'm on my own and I can't get the scooter in or out. 'I'm getting a bit fed up to be honest. It takes me about an hour to walk half the length of a football pitch and I need to rest every so often due to medical conditions. 'When I asked social services how I was expected to get out of the house to do my shopping I was told to get a taxi. I then asked them what I'd do once I got into town and they said I should just find a seat. Mr Pugh, pictured left with a mobility scooter from the Royal British Legion that has gone unused, and right, in 1975 when he was attached to the Cadets . 'I just want to put my coat on and go out for a bottle of milk, or some crisps, or a newspaper. I would like to do it myself.' Dean Fowler, chairman of the Ripley branch of the Royal British Legion, said Mr Pugh had been in contact with Derbyshire County Council since the start of the year. Members clubbed together and gave the veteran a mobility scooter in February, but it has languished in another member's garage because there was no way to use it. But a council spokesman insisted officials did not know the mobility scooter existed until last week, when it was moved for storage inside Mr Pugh's house. Mr Pugh could make it to the top of these steps but no further - and has not been out alone for months . Royal British Legion branch chairman Dean Fowler said: 'When Roy's been phoning these departments he's been bounced from one to another and no one's given him a clear and concise decision' Mr Fowler said: 'Roy's a very proud man and despite being able to get around his home he just doesn't have the strength to get down the steps either side of his house and into town to do the things we take for granted... It's disgusting. 'When Roy's been phoning these departments he's been bounced from one to another and no one's given him a clear and concise decision. 'Roy receives help from carers and his family but it's just not the same as being able to do things for yourself.' A Derbyshire County Council spokesman said Mr Pugh first asked for a ramp on February 25, but was declined because he was using a walking frame, which a ramp can make more dangerous. War veteran Mr Pugh, pictured left and right in 1975, has served with the Army in North Korea for six years and as a reservist for nine years . He was seen again in April and given a wheelchair in which friends could push him around, but again, 'a ramp was not thought to be appropriate'. A social worker then visited him on May 25, but his request was declined for a third time. The spokesman added: 'In July he was put forward for assessment. Due to a lengthy waiting list, he was assessed on November 11 and it was agreed that, subject to the outcome of a visit this week, we would recommend a ramp be provided.' The spokesman insisted officers had no knowledge of the mobility scooter until last week. The final stages are being considered by Amber Valley Borough Council. Housing manager David Arkle said: 'When Amber Valley Borough Council receives the formal assessment we will ensure that a means test is completed to ensure financial eligibility. 'It is important that every case is treated on its merits and the specific needs of the applicant are taken into account.' Nigel Mills, conservative MP for Amber Valley said: 'It is disappointing that Mr Pugh has been let down by Derbyshire County Council's Social Services. 'It is unacceptable that a war veteran has lost his independence as he tries to recover. 'I hope that the ramp can finally be installed soon and Mr Pugh can then use the scooter the British Legion have provided him with - a further example of the great work they do for our veterans.'","Roy Pugh in long battle with authorities over  home in Ripley, Derbyshire .

"George Osborne will announce protection for the elderly and other vulnerable people, face-to-face visits from the taxman, and an appeal process . George Osborne will today announce a series of climbdowns over controversial plans to allow the taxman to seize money directly from people’s bank accounts. The Chancellor will agree to introduce new safeguards designed to prevent misuse of the powers, expected to be applied to around 17,000 ‘persistent’ non-payers a year. Following months of controversy, Mr Osborne will announce that people will have to have a face-to-face visit from a tax official before money can be clawed back, a 30-day grace period to arrange a repayment plan and a right to appeal to a county court. And vulnerable individuals, such as elderly people, will be protected, the Treasury will say. In March, it was announced that the Government would ‘modernise and strengthen’ the taxman’s ability to call in debts by allowing ‘direct recovery’ of cash from bank and building society accounts, including Isas. Experts warned the HMRC’s long track record of errors meant it could not be trusted as ‘judge, jury and executioner’ and suggested it could prompt savers to go back to storing cash under the mattress. The latest concessions were welcomed by some of those who have previously attacked the plans, but are unlikely to appease all critics. Though ministers say many other tax authorities around the world, including in Australia, France and America, have similar powers, MPs had described the original plans as ‘horrifying’. Around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the debt recovery powers without the need for HMRC to go to court. Officials expect to recoup around £375 million that would otherwise have gone unpaid between 2015 and 2019. It says it will only apply to persistent debts of over £1,000, and ensure its targets always have at least £5,000 left over after any raid on their accounts. Bank account raids are only supposed to be used when debtors have repeatedly ignored attempts to make contact. Under today’s concessions, they will also be guaranteed a face-to-face visit from an HMRC official, to ensure that they have a chance to challenge and settle their affairs – whether by paying in full or setting up a payment plan. New legislation will allow HMRC to dip into the bank accounts of 'persistent non-payer' of tax and take what is owed, including from join accounts and Isas . The visit will also allow officials to identify vulnerable members of society to provide them with appropriate support, ministers say. Legislation will allow for appeal to the County Court, while a hold on debtors’ accounts before money is take will now be 30 days – more than twice as long as previously planned – to allow people to make contact and arrange a payment plan or mount an objection. Financial Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke will say: ‘This is about levelling the playing field. The vast majority of people pay the tax that is due, on time, but there is still a very small minority who try to gain an unfair advantage by persistently refusing to pay what they owe, despite being able to. 'These are the people who will be targeted by the powers for the direct recovery of debts owed to the Exchequer. ‘We already set out robust safeguards to protect vulnerable debtors in our original direct recovery of debts proposals, but feedback from the consultation process told us we could do more to make sure this only catches those who are playing the system. ‘We’re strengthening the guarantees we can offer taxpayers that the powers will only be used when debtors have consistently refused to talk to HMRC and settle their debts, and their use will be subject to the toughest scrutiny and oversight possible. ‘We’re far from the first country to take this step – many other tax authorities already use similar powers routinely and responsibly as a crucial lever for ensuring their government is paid what is owed.’ Paul Aplin, the chair of the tax technical committee at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: ‘The most fundamental concern we had was the lack of any independent oversight or any right to appeal to a court. ‘We’ve got the independent oversight, which is what we’ve been pushing for since day one. We’ve got to see the detail in the draft legislation, but the main concern was the lack of right of appeal and we’ve got that. ‘But this is now a fundamentally different power. Now we’ve got a right of appeal, this is a fundamentally different proposition.’ Stephen Herring, head of taxation at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘This should remove some of the more authentic objections. ‘There was a valid objection about the sort of people who are vulnerable, elderly people for instance. It’s a sensible and valid thing to do to insist on a visit to identify those sorts of cases before any direct recovery of money can take place. ‘This shouldn’t be about people who can’t pay, but people who can pay but simply won’t. Most businesses will be in favour of a system with reasonable safeguards.’","New powers will allow HMRC to dip into bank accounts and take money .

"This is Britain’s oldest surviving floating warship - where three men responsible for its maintenance must work round the clock to keep it pristine.

The impressive warship was built in Bombay, India, in 1817 for the Royal Navy shortly after the Napoleonic Wars. The ship - named after the 1782 Battle of Trincomalee - was transferred from Portsmouth to Hartlepool where she has remained for the last 27 years. HMS Trincomalee is now listed as part of the National Historic Fleet and is maintained by the HMS Trincomalee Trust, a registered charity. David McKnight, 52, general manager of the trust, said it takes 20 gallons of paint to touch up the boat every few years. Mr McKnight, of Bedale, North Yorkshire, said: ‘We have three full-time men working on the maintenance of the ship. Far from light work: The ship was one of the most restored in the world, and the trust said 'we need to keep it that way' Sanding the wheel: Keeping the rain water from the inside of the boat is a big problem for employees .

Mast: David McKnight from the trust said he 'couldn’t imagine any other comparable job, it is such a rare job to have' Having a blast: The Trincomalee is 52 years younger than HMS Victory - but that is in dry dock in Portsmouth . ‘The ship was one of the most restored in the world - it was very well restored so we need to keep it that way. ‘She is the only warship left of her type so it is important to keep her fully maintained. ‘There are stacks of jobs for the three men to do, it is sheer hard work. 'Keeping the rain water from the inside of the boat is a big problem. ‘Rain water is the enemy whereas salt water is our friend as it helps to maintain the timbers. 'I couldn’t imagine any other comparable job - it is such a rare job to have.’ The Trincomalee holds the proud title of being the oldest British warship still afloat. This is because Lord Nelson's flagship HMS Victory, despite being 52 years her senior, is in dry dock in Portsmouth. HMS Trincomalee, a 38-gun frigate, was launched in October 1817 in Bombay, India, following her construction - which cost £23,000. After being fitted with temporary masts and rigging, and picking up guns and ammunition on the way to Britain, she arrived in Portsmouth in 1819. During her first commission, the 1,447-ton ship provided hurricane relief in Bermuda in 1847, as well as preventing an invasion of Cuba. Long history: Following a restoration HMS Trincomalee has become the centrepiece of Hartlepool Historic Dockyard in County Durham . After returning to Britain and being refitted, she headed for Vancouver in 1852 under the command of Captain Wallace Houstoun. From there she patrolled the west coast of North America and the Pacific Ocean. Her role over the next few decades involved being a training vessel in various ports in Britain including Hartlepool and Southampton. She was then renamed TS Foudroyant in 1903 in honour of an earlier ship that was wrecked. She remained in service until 1986 - including as a storage and training vessel in the Second World War - and was renamed Trincomalee in 1992. The ship spent most of her 20th century life in Gosport, Hampshire - and was afloat for all of that time. But she was brought up to Hartlepool in 1987 by a heavy-lift barge for restoration, and is unlikely to go out to sea again now because of her value. Following the restoration she has become the centrepiece of Hartlepool Historic Dockyard, and the managing trust says she is in very good condition.","Workers face never-ending task which involves scaling heights of HMS Trincomalee's mast in Hartlepool .

"Police are investigating  a 'kidnap' sticker plastered on the back of a pick-up truck that creates the illusion a young woman is bound and gagged in the back. Pictures of the vehicle and its controversial bumper sticker were taken in Leeds and is being spread across the internet  using the hashtag #rapetruck. Detectives from West Yorkshire Police say they have spoken to the owner, believed to be fitness trainer James Hellewell, and the force say he has agreed to remove it. Mr Hellewell was warned that driving around with his sticker could be classed as a public order offence. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Police have got involved after this sticker was spotted on the back of a pick-up in Leeds . Video courtesy of KWTX.com . He appears to have initially agreed to take it off but may now have refused. Tweeting about police demanding he take it off he wrote: 'NO' hours after saying it had been 'fun' having the sticker but he would remove the 'wrap'. Leonie Smith tweeted West Yorkshire Police and the Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire, about the sticker. Since then she says trolls have been sending her threatening messages. She said: 'I was just absolutely disgusted and outraged. I thought it was too serious not to say something. “Rape is a serious problem and domestic violence is not a joke, so to drive around with a woman bound and gagged is not acceptable.” She added: “Some people are arguing that it is freedom of speech to have that on your car. “It’s in my city and I am not OK with this kind of culture being tolerated in Leeds.

"Jailed: Joaquin Rabasco was jailed for 18 months after posting an animation showing 20 ways to kill a woman online . A politician who posted a video on his local party's website detailing 20 gruesome ways to end a woman's life has been jailed for 18 months. Joaquín Rabasco was found guilty of uploading the sick animation - which included a woman dying while riding her bike, in the lava of a volcano and being chopped into pieces by an industrial fan. A judge in Mallorca, Spain, yesterday said the 60-year-old had promoted 'clearly contemptuous images of women' which tried to demonstrate 'the uselessness of women'. Rabasco, also a former policeman, was fined €18,000 for inciting gender violence. His secretary Claudia Falleman was handed the same sentence. The court heard that the cartoons were uploaded in 2005 and remained online for more than two months. Judge Francisco José Pérez said the pair deserved such harsh sentences because the uploading of the animation was 'of such gravity'. Diario de Mallorca reported he said it 'presented women as banal, whose death was funny and whose intelligence is so low that they will do nothing to try to save their lives.' The animation, called The Naked Woman, showed 20 ways to end the life of a woman riding a bicycle. The character was nude, and drawn with oversized breasts. The running 'joke' of the video, the newspaper reported, was that her breasts were so big she could not see over the top of them. Other ways the character met her death included running over a dog that split in two and resulted in them both dying, cycling over broken glass and being caught in a trap meant for tigers. Joaquin Rabasco was a councillor in Llucmajor, Mallorca . The judge added in his 100 page sentencing report: 'The spread of animations like the one in question does not encourage or contribute anything to placing men and women on equal terms, which is exactly what they are.' Rabasco was a councillor for the area of Llucmajor in an alliance between the ASI (Independent Social Action) group, and the conservative Popular Party. El Pais newspaper reports he already had a criminal record after being sentenced to two years in jail for corruption. Rabasco revealed he will appeal against his latest jail sentence.","Joaquin Rabasco - a councillor in Llucmajor, Mallorca, was jailed for 18 months for posting the video back in 2005 .

Jack cowers under a table whenever he hears doorbells or phones ringing and even the ping of a microwave can cause him to scarper. The hapless hound also runs scared at the sound of people sneezing and cutlery scraping against plates, making it difficult to find a quiet enough home for the petrified pup. Scroll down for video .

Canine carer Jordan Cooper (pictured) and the rest of the Dogs Trust team in Ilfracombe, Devon, are appealing for patient owners to come forward and home Jack . Staff at the Dogs Trust, in Ilfracombe, Devon, have to talk in whispers whenever they're near him - and even then he runs off and hides if he can hear them. Jack wears a special jacket designed to feel like he is constantly being cuddled but he still has to be moved around the building so he can be in the quietest spots. His old owners, who took him in when he was a puppy, had to give him back because his anxiety was too much for them to cope with. Pam Stow, the charity's rehoming centre manager, said dogs usually become acclimatised to everyday sounds over time. But Jack is unable to adapt to the sort of background noises we barely notice and each time he hears one he becomes distressed. He is currently spending time with an animal behaviour specialist who is trying to help him conquer his fears. Despite Jack's skittish tendencies, Ms Stow says Jack is a warm, affectionate dog and perfect for rehoming. She said: 'Poor Jack is quite nervous and lots of things are scary for him. 'We are looking for a quiet and understanding home with new owners who will learn to help him cope with his phobias and enjoy life. 'Due to his wariness, it may take a few visits for Jack to bond with his new owners so they will need to be patient.

"Cleared: Rap fan Christopher Jones was not convicted of racism after he shouted the word n***** towards a black man . A rap-mad music fan who shouted n***** at a black man has walked free from court after magistrates agreed he had just been using 'street slang'. Christopher Jones was arrested after he was overheard aiming the offensive word at a group of men in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, on September 10. But the sign-writer claimed he couldn’t be racist . because he listened to hip-hop music, had 'more black friends than . white friends' and this is what he called everyone. Police charged him with using racially-aggravated words or behaviour and Jones was hauled before magistrates last week. And he was cleared of racist abuse after successfully arguing that he regularly uses the word n****r as 'a term of endearment' on the streets around his home. North Staffordshire Magistrates ruled he had used the phrase without hostility - and dismissed the case. 'We find the language used alleged by the prosecution, but he did not use it to demonstrate hostility towards a group - but used it in parlance,' the chair of the bench said. 'We do not find the defendant guilty.' Defending, Rob Holt QC said the word had crept into the English language and is frequently used on the estate where he is from. 'This word has crept into the English language and is used on a regular basis,' he said. 'His use of the word is popular culture. 'He is of the opinion he simply addressed these people as he addresses them in daily speak.' Plea: Christopher and his wife Andrea both want the public to know he is not racist and says he uses the phrase as a 'term of endearment' Parlance: Christopher, pictured with his dog, successfully argued he had 'more black friends than white friends' and was not a racist . Speaking for the first time since the case Mr Jones insisted he was not a racist. Case: North Staffordshire Magistrates ruled Christopher had used the phrase without hostility - and let him go free . Mr Jones, who describes himself on his Facebook page as a “chief tokin futha mucka” said: 'I listen to hip hop music, it is just a standard word and not a racial thing to me at all. 'I probably have more black friends than I have white friends and this is just how I speak. 'I am not surprised that I went to court as the law has to flex its muscles. 'I am not a racist, it was used as slang. For me it is a term of endearment, not something racist. 'I like hip hop and it is a word that is used all the time in music. 'I can be sat with a black friend and I will say ‘what up, n*****?’, and it’s a term of endearment.”His wife Andrea, 43, added: 'He is not a troublemaker. We are in no way racist.' However anti-race campaigners yesterday condemned the court ruling saying the word had too many negative connotations and should not be used in any circumstances. Colley Sykes, who helps to organise an annual carnival in Stoke-on-Trent to promote multiculturalism, said: 'The magistrates have made a mistake - you cannot just sling words like that around. 'It is the last word you should use towards someone who is black. It has too many negative historical links.'","Christopher Jones argued the word is a 'term of endearment' for him .

"Labour leader Ed Miliband outlined his plan to bring in a mansion tax in his conference speech, but economists fear the £1.2billion haul from the measure would be wiped out by plunging stamp duty, inheritance tax and running costs . Labour’s £1.2billion-a-year mansion tax haul could be virtually wiped out by plunging stamp duty, inheritance tax and running costs, experts warned last night. Many prospective buyers desperate to avoid a new annual one per cent tax on properties worth more than £2million would lower their offers, research suggests. Meanwhile, sellers wary of trying to market homes burdened with the mansion tax would be more likely to price them lower. Even a 10 per cent fall in the value of properties priced £2million or more would trigger a £500million slump in tax receipts for stamp duty and death duties, analysis by estate agent Savills shows. And when the annual cost of running a new valuation department is added to the money needed to pay owners’ appeal bills, the anticipated £1.2billion gain could be lost. Lucian Cook, director of research at Savills, said: ‘There would be significant problems with the implementation of a mansion tax – not least regarding property valuations. ‘The potential is there for big leakage in the system, particularly from lower levels of stamp duty and inheritance tax.’ Elaine Clark, managing director of CheapAccounting, said: ‘The cost of running what is likely to be a new government department could be hundreds of millions of pounds. ‘Add all this in to the likely fall in taxes, and the gains could easily be wiped out – the whole premise is unworkable.’ And James Browne, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: ‘Adding in a mansion tax of one per cent a year won’t be very attractive to a buyer or a seller. So prices could fall as people price in the impact of this annual cost every year.’ Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband put the levy at the heart of his speech at the Labour Party conference, as part of proposals to spend £2.5billion a year more on the NHS. More than 100,000 households could end up paying a new average tax bill of £15,000 if the tax is introduced at one per cent of values above a £2million threshold as anticipated. In May, 238 homes worth more than £2million were sold, figures from the Land Registry show, up by 46 per cent compared to the year before. While Labour says the tax will target only wealthy owners, there are fears it will unfairly hit pensioners who bought homes decades ago which have rocketed in value. This could leave pensioners on limited incomes trapped and forced to take out loans to cover the tax. It has been suggested that elderly homeowners without the money to pay up front may be able to put off paying the tax until they die. But this would still leave their families faced with bills for tens of thousands of pounds. George Bull, senior tax partner at accountant Baker Tilly, said: ‘For people who can’t afford the costs up front, deferring a mansion tax bill like this is a hard way of making it easy for them to cope with it.’ Kate Barker, who used to sit on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates, said she 'wouldn't do the mansion tax' herself . An estimated 250,000 people will also have to stump up hundreds of pounds to pay for a surveyor in order to work out if their property is worth more than £2million, estate agent Knight Frank suggested. At today’s prices, its figures indicate that 110,000 homes will be affected by the mansion tax – double its 2013 estimate. Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, said: ‘The cost of these valuations for householders who aren’t sure if their home would fall within the bracket is going to be a real problem. It’s yet another layer of charges on the property market.’ And yesterday a former Bank of England economist who authored a report on housing for the last Labour government criticised the mansion tax. Kate Barker – who used to sit on the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates, said: ‘It’s difficult to feel sorry about the effects of house prices as they have risen so rapidly.’ But she went on to say that the move would be ‘very disruptive’, adding: ‘I wouldn’t do the mansion tax myself.’ Ed Miliband’s mansion tax would hit homeowners in the south east of England to help Labour deliver an NHS windfall for Scotland, it has emerged. Despite the fact that only 0.3 per cent of the properties paying the levy would be north of the border, the Scottish government would get 10 per cent of the proceeds. Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘Just when most people recognise we need to restore financial and democratic balance across the UK, Labour and the Lib Dems have come up with a polarising tax that treats England like a cash cow.’ And Margaret Hodge, a Labour candidate to stand for London mayor, said: ‘Over 90 per cent of the money raised from the proposed tax will be from Londoners. Surely it is only fair that this should be spent in London.’","Ed Miliband believes a mansion tax will bring in £1.2billion to the Treasury .

"Before you start channel hopping, you may consider pulling on a pair of rubber gloves. Researchers have found all manner of nasties lurking between the buttons of hotel remote controls. Scientists from the Today programme's Rossen Reports investigated hotel rooms at five major hotel chains in the US after housekeeping had finished cleaning them. Filthy: In every room they tested, scientists found sky-high levels of bacteria . Using an ultraviolet backlight to show up dirt unseen by the human eye, they uncovered suspicious stains throughout the room, such as on a sofa and a curtain. The researchers used a special meter which provided readouts of the bacteria counts - areas which scored over 100 on the scale, were seen as having an unacceptable level of bacteria. The telephones were found to contain double  acceptable limit. But the remote controls had levels of up to 498 - which was the highest bacteria reading they measured. Light switches . Alarm clocks .

'So perhaps someone used the restroom and didn't wash their hands when they were done.' Meanwhile, the cleanest areas in the rooms were found to be the light switches, which had readings as low as 6, and the alarm clocks and nightstands. The experts suggested that hotel guests  protect themselves from bacteria by washing their hands, using hand sanitizer and wiping down surfaces with a disinfectant wipe. The findings come after a previous study, led by Katie Kirsch, an undergraduate student at the University of Houston, and colleagues from the University of South Carolina, tested for levels of total aerobic bacteria and fecal bacteria in hotel rooms across America. They found that the dirtiest surfaces were bathroom sinks and floors as well as TV remote controls. Surfaces with the lowest level of contamination were headboards, curtain rods and bathroom door handles.","Researchers found high levels of bacteria in remote controls in hotels .

"Admission: 'The government finances are in paralysis state at the present moment', Mr Biti admitted . Zimbabwe's finance minister has taken a hard look at the cash strapped country's bank accounts - and discovered it only has £138 and 34 pence left. Tendai Biti made the announcement at press conference yesterday declaring: 'Last week when we paid civil servants there was $217 in government coffers.' Mr Biti went on to tell the shocked news reporters that they were individually likely to have healthier bank balances than the state's. 'The government finances are in paralysis state at the present moment', Mr Biti admitted. However, Mr Biti today contradicted his claims by saying that the poor state of the country's finances only lasted a day. Speaking to the BBC, he said the following day about $30m of revenue was paid into the government's accounts. Mr Biti claims he made the remarkable revelations to highlight that the government could not finance the constitutional referendum and election that are planned for sometime later this year. Speaking to the BBC's Focus on Africa . radio programme, he claimed his statement had been misreported. He said: . 'You journalists are mischievous and malicious - the point I was making . was that the Zimbabwean government doesn't have the funds to finance . the election, to finance the referendum,' he said. 'To dramatise the point, I simply made a passing reference . metaphorically that when we paid civil servants last week on Thursday we . were left with $217... but even the following day we had $30m in our . account.' The stunning confession about the country's poor financial state is the culmination of years of ruinous economic policy by Zimbabwe's despotic President Robert Mugabe, who has ruled the southern African country since independence from Britain in 1980. Dire: Three-quarters of the population live on less than £1 a day and over half of the work force is unemployed . A decade ago Mugabe, now aged 88, . launched his deeply controversial policy of expropriating white-owned . farmland and handing it to blacks. The . policy, which saw 4,000 white farmers forcibly kicked off their land, . was economically disastrous as in many cases the farms' new owners . lacked the skills or inclination to run the farms properly. It also demolished investor confidence in the country, paralysed production, and prompted international sanctions. As . a result, Zimbabwe - which was once the fertile 'bread basket' of . southern Africa and possesses fantastic mineral wealth - is now one of . the continent's poorest countries. Broke: The confession is the culmination of years of ruinous economic policy by Zimbabwe's despotic President Mugabe . Three-quarters of the population live on less than £1 a day and over half of the work force is unemployed. In 2008 hyperinflation in the country reached the astronomical figure of 230 million per cent - meaning that paper money became worthless almost as soon as it was printed. The former British colony now uses US dollars. Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Biti claimed that the state's dire lack of cash means it does not have enough money to organise the constitutional referendum. 'We will be approaching the international community to assist us in this regard', Mr Biti said. Following a disputed election in 2008, Zimbabwe is now ruled by a coalition of Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. However, the arrangement is marred by political infighting and is widely considered to be ineffective. Mugabe is aged 88 and is reported to have pancreatic cancer. He however insists that he is the only person who can rule the country effectively. Rather than acknowledge his own role in the country's economic collapse, Mugabe blames the West, which has imposed economic sanctions in protest at his increasingly autocratic rule.","Tendai Biti made the announcement at press conference declaring: 'Last week when we paid civil servants there was $217 in government coffers'

"These are the damning images that prove the anti-capitalist protest that has closed St Paul’s Cathedral is all but deserted at night. Footage from a thermal imaging camera taken late at night reveals just a fraction of the makeshift camp was occupied. An independent thermal imaging company, commissioned by the Daily Mail, captured these pictures after similar footage from a police helicopter found only one in ten tents were occupied after dark. Lone protest: Just three tents are occupied, as shown by the yellow and red from the thermal imaging camera. Behind, similar colours highlight warmer shops and their windows. Empty tents are in purple . Returning to life: Same view of the camp looking busier in daylight yesterday . Cooling emotions: The thermal imaging pictures show that the protesters' fervour seems to fade a little at sundown . Abandoned: The shack-like building behind empty purple tents is a marquee. An occupied tent is in red and yellow . Deserted: In London, the protesters' tents are pretty much deserted in a thermal imaging photo taken last weekend . In these shots, taken late on Monday night, the presence of body heat from humans is represented by yellow and red inside the tents. The tents that are coloured purple indicate they are colder and thus empty. The buildings behind are also yellow and red because of the higher temperatures inside. The images suggest the vast majority of the demonstrators who gather around the cathedral to denounce capitalism during the day go home or to a hotel to stay warm at night. But despite being an almost entirely . part time protest, the activists last week forced St Paul’s to shut for . the first time since the Blitz, and the cathedral appears unlikely to . reopen for months. Chilly: The images were taken at 11pm on Monday night, when most activists could be expected to have been curled up in their tents keeping warm . Heat seeking: A man can be seen next to his occupied tent, which is glowing white, red and green from warmth . Protest or charade? Seen from another angle, nearly all of the tents appear to be unoccupied. There have been calls to clear the protest camp while it lies empty . Yesterday there were calls for the . police to clear the camp at night when it is virtually empty. The . Corporation of London has been talking with lawyers about launching . court action, but so far no formal proceedings have begun. Councillor . Alex Deane said: ‘It is frankly farcical that most of these tents are . unoccupied. It should be easier to evict part-time squatters. ‘They have to go. Surely even . the protesters would agree that money spent on a lengthy court battle to . clear the area would be far better spent on schools, hospitals, youth . groups and housing.’ Mark Field, Tory MP for Cities of . London and Westminster, said: ‘It appears it’s a daytime protest that . dies off at night – so that would be the time for police to go in and . remove them.’ Not just a game: Protesters make a statement with a piece of installation artwork based on the board game Monopoly . This image was taken at about 1am this morning, showing considerably more activity than when the thermal images were taken. The bright light is from the floodlit shops of Paternoster Square . Part timers? A couple look at notices put up on the side of a marquee. Right, protesters sit chatting in the night air outside their tents at about 1am this morning . Security: A dog stands guard at the entrance to a tent near the cathedral steps at the front of the occupation camp . The Bishop of London this morning . also stepped into the row over the occupation, saying it is 'time for . the protesters to leave'. Richard Chartres, the third most . senior cleric in the Church of England, said in a statement: 'This . demonstration has undoubtedly raised a number of very important . questions. 'The St Paul's Institute has itself . focused on the issue of executive pay and I am involved in ongoing . discussions with City leaders about improving shareholder influence on . excessive remuneration. 'Nevertheless, the time has come for . the protesters to leave, before the camp's presence threatens to eclipse . entirely the issues that it was set up to address. 'The Dean and the Chapter, who are . responsible for St Paul's, have already made it clear that the protest . should come to an end and I fully support that view.' Mucking in: A protester sweeps the steps in front of the cathedral, where many tourists and visitors to the occupation camp sit during the day . Tent city: A couple walk by the damp protest shanty town last night, lit by the glare of the street lights . Rubbish: The protest planners have set up bins and toilets for campers and visitors to use . His comments came as Occupy London Stock Exchange denied suggestions that 90 per cent of the tents were left unoccupied overnight. In a statement, the group said of the claims: 'This is simply not the case. We try to keep vacancy to a minimum and operate a sign in/sign out system to help ensure this happens. 'When someone knows they will not be staying overnight, they offer their tent to someone else. 'We are ordinary people with jobs and families. We are occupying in order to register our objection to being shut out of the political process. 'The fact that we are camping out here shows how seriously we take our right to participate and be heard.' One self-confessed part-time protester is Robin Smith, a 48-year-old former Conservative councillor for Wokingham Town Council. He said: ‘There are lots of middle-class people turning up and helping but they have to go back home and some people come once and go away. Part-timer: Protester Robin Smith, a former Tory councillor, admits that he goes home every few days to have a wash before returning to his tent . ‘They’ve got jobs and a family to keep, so they’ve got to look after their kids or go to work. I go home every two or three nights to get cleaned up and then return to my tent.’ The daytime-only protesters make a mockery of the slogan posted on tents and buildings around the camp which declares: ‘All day, all week, we’ll sleep on London’s freezing streets. Solidarity!’ The Corporation of London fears moves to evict the protesters could be delayed because of human rights legislation. It follows the difficulties nearby Westminster Council had trying to remove anti-Iraq War protester Brian Haw from Parliament Square. The first attempt was turned down in 2002 in part because a High Court judge ruled Mr Haw’s vigil was protected by Human Rights Act provisions on free speech. Mr Field called on the cathedral to reopen during any protracted legal battle to clear the site. He said: ‘Tourists can’t see one of the jewels in the crown of London and we’ve got major events coming up, including the Lord Mayor’s Show and Remembrance Day.’ Yesterday a giant Monopoly board appeared at the camp. Instead of the names of London streets it featured cities hard hit by the global financial crisis, and the game’s symbol of a smiling capitalist wearing a top hat had been transformed into a dishevelled figure begging for hand-outs. Protesters said the board was made by secretive artist Banksy but a spokesman for the artist was unable to verify this. 'Go for it lads. Any poor soul out there must be absolutely frozen'","'The time has come for the protesters to leave,' says the Bishop of London ."
"Peering into the mirror, I carefully apply a thick layer of a fetching coral pink lipstick. But I can’t help but feel I look slightly like a small child who’s got hold of her mother’s make-up bag. That’s because I’m not wearing it on my lips, but have smeared it around my eyes. I’m trying the latest internet beauty tip, which suggests that, when it comes to dark circles around the eyes, lipstick could be the secret weapon we’ve all been looking for. Last week, websites and forums were buzzing with the news after a beauty blogger revealed her unconventional approach in a video posted on YouTube. Scroll down for video . BEFORE: Claire Coleman (pictured) has spent years searching for the perfect concealer to hide her dark circles . She advocated using an orangey-red lipstick, applied with a brush, all around the eye area, before applying your regular concealer, insisting that it gave a better result than concealer alone. In the video, Deepica Mutyala starts her make-up routine by taking an eye-shadow brush, dabbing it on the lipstick and then tapping the colour around her eye wherever she has dark circles or blemishes. She blends it with the brush until she has two raccoon-style orange circles around her eyes and then continues with the rest of her make-up, using a sponge to apply concealer over the top of the lipstick. The result is impressive and, as celebrity make-up artist Oonagh Connor explains, while it might sound — and look — peculiar, it makes perfect sense. ‘Dark circles around the eyes tend to be blue or purple in tone,’ Oonagh says. ‘When you look at a colour wheel [a visual representation of all the colours of the rainbow, arranged according to how they relate to each other], those shades sit directly opposite the corally oranges, which means that the lipstick should help neutralise the darkness.’ She adds: ‘It’s similar to the way in which people with very red tones in their skin are advised to use a green colour-correcting cream to cancel out the redness, because green and red are opposite each other on the colour wheel.’ DURING: Claire (pictured) bravely opted to try out the new beauty craze sweeping the internet which involves using lipstick to cover up under eye dark circles . Like many people, I seem to be permanently cursed with dark circles around my eyes, irrespective of how much sleep I’ve had. Dark circles happen for a number of reasons. Because the skin around the eye area is thinner than elsewhere, the blood vessels beneath the surface are more apparent, giving a darker appearance — and while sleep, a healthy diet and avoiding cigarettes and alcohol can help alleviate the problem, some people, like me, are genetically predisposed to looking like pandas. So, if you can’t get rid of them, you have to cover them up. Over the years, I’ve tried almost every concealer going. Everyone swears by the reflective powers of YSL’s Touche Eclat (£25), but the texture is light and I felt I needed heavier coverage — and while its light-reflecting properties work well in real life, if you’re photographed with a flash, because of the way it bounces back light you can look like you have white stripes under your eyes. Then there was Estee Lauder’s Double Wear Maximum Cover (£29.50), which definitely did cover, but felt a bit cakey, with a tendency to sit in creases. Currently, I’m using Benefit’s Boi-ing (£17.50) which isn’t bad, but has a tendency to dull my skin. Which was why, when I heard about this new approach, I was intrigued enough to give it a go. Although the video suggests using a deep orange-red lipstick, Oonagh recommends I try something a little less dramatic. ‘Deepika’s got a darker skin tone than you, so I think that the shade she’s used will be too dark. I’d recommend something that still has those orange tones, but is more coral than fiery orange.’ I decide to try Estee Lauder’s Hydra Lustre Lipstick in Portofino Coral. It’s sheer — anything sparkly wouldn’t work — but has a good amount of pigment. Because I’m putting on more make-up than usual, Oonagh advises that I use an eye cream first to keep the area well hydrated to avoid the end result looking caked on. Rather than messing around with a brush — who has the time? — I decide to simply scrawl it directly on to my face, under the eyes and into the eye socket, where I also have dark marks, before smudging it slightly with my ring finger. Although I feel a bit stupid, the feel of the lipstick on my skin isn’t that strange. Because it’s a sheer lipstick, it goes on easily, doesn’t drag the skin when I smudge it, and doesn’t feel like it’s too heavy. AFTER: Claire (pictured) was impressed by the results but did not like the fact that she felt like she was caked in make-up . I’m still not convinced it is going to work, but I let it sit for a minute as many cosmetics need a bit of time to ‘set’, and then, as per instructions, begin to apply my regular concealer over the top. ‘Use your finger or a sponge to press the concealer on top of the lipstick,’ says Oonagh. ‘If you use a sponge with a pointed tip, you can get right into the corner of the eye and up to the lash line. But press, don’t rub, or you’ll mix it all together and end up with a pink mess.’ Gradually, I build up the coverage of my concealer over the top of the lipstick and, to my surprise, it looks like it’s working. When I’ve finished, the dark circles are gone — as has the coral lipstick. But whereas my concealer often looks chalky, the combination of the pinky-orange tones, and the glossy formulation of the lipstick underneath, means that the end result is warmer, more radiant and more natural. On the downside, I do feel like I’m caked in make-up and I can’t help feeling that using a better concealer — or even blending a touch of lipstick into my concealer before applying it — might be a better, and more lightweight, solution. This is especially the case as the day goes on, and the heavy make-up begins to settle into the fine lines under my eyes, leaving creases. It’s not something that I’d do every day, but for an early morning meeting when I’m feeling bleary eyed, it’s a useful trick to have up my sleeve. For now, though, my search for the ultimate concealer continues.","Beauty blogger, Deepica Mutyala, revealed the unusual method last week .

"Wales is currently discussing a 'strike' which would black out Wikipedia in protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act in America - a bill that critics allege would penalise sites such as Wikipedia where users are free to publish what they want . Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has threatened a 'strike' where the entire English-language site would be turned off as a protest against  an anti-piracy bill currently under discussion in the U.S. The site is used by an estimated 365 million readers worldwide, and is ranked sixth overall on earth. Writing on his private Wikipedia blog, Wales said, 'A global strike of at least the English Wikipedia would put the maximum . pressure on the US government. 'At the same time, it's of course a very . very big deal to do something like this, it is unprecedented for English . Wikipedia.' The threatened 'strike' - which would black out Wikipedia in English and possibly other languages - is in response to the Stop Online Piracy Act, which is currently before the House Judiciary Committee. Opponents of the bill - designed to protect copyright online - allege that it takes a 'guilty until proven innocent approach'. Sites such as Wikipedia, where content can be published by any user, are alleged to be at risk. The activist group Electronic Frontier Foundation said, 'At a minimum, this means that any service that hosts user generated content is going to be under enormous pressure to actively monitor and filter that content.' 'That’s a huge burden, and worse for services that are just getting started – the YouTubes of tomorrow that are generating jobs today.' At present, Mr Wales's proposed 'strike' has been put up for discussion on the site. There are hundreds of comments from site insiders, most of which 'Firmly Support' the action. 'This bill is a threat to the internet, and must be stopped,' says one. In Italy, Wikipedia took down almost the entire site in response to a law that would have made it a criminal offence to publish the results of police wire taps. The site threatened to make the blackout permanent. 'A few months ago, the Italian Wikipedia community made a decision to blank all of Italian Wikipedia for a short period in order to protest a law which would infringe on their editorial independence,' wrote Wales. 'The Italian Parliament backed down immediately. As Wikipedians may or may not be aware, a much worse law going under the misleading title of Stop Online Piracy Act is working its way through Congress on a bit of a fast track. 'I thought this would be a good time to take a quick reading of the community feeling on this issue.' 'My own view is that a community strike was very powerful and successful in Italy and could be even more powerful in this case. There are obviously many questions about whether the strike should be geotargetted - U.S-only, etc. 'One possible view is that because the law would seriously impact the functioning of Wikipedia for everyone, a global strike of at least the English Wikipedia would put the maximum pressure on the US government. 'At the same time, it's of course a very very big deal to do something like this, it is unprecedented for English Wikipedia.'","Co-founder says a global strike would put 'maximum pressure' on U.S. government .

"Austrian town: The name is thought to derive from a sixth century noble called Lord Focko . An Austrian political party has defended a decision to promote a local beer called F***ing Hell - named after a village in the country and the German word for 'lite'. The extraordinary brand name was initially banned when the product was released in 2010 but the company took the fight all the way to the EU's trademark authority who eventually overturned the decision. And the beer was recently promoted on the website of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria, for the district of Schaerding - which neighbours F***ing. Both districts are found in the northern Austrian province of Upper Austria and the Freedom Party say the promotion was a way of showing solidarity with their neighbours. The advert on the homepage leads to a website where it is possible to buy the alcohol on order from the neighbouring village of 'F***ing'. In 2010 the Trade Marks and Designs Registration Office of the European Union ruled that although it might be an obscene swearword in the English language, in German it was simply the name of the village - and a light 'hell' type of beer. They said in a statement that it had rejected a complaint that the trade mark 'F***ing Hell' was upsetting, accusatory and derogatory. They added: 'The word combination claimed contains no semantic indication that could refer to a certain person or group of persons. 'Nor does it incite a particular act. It cannot even be understood as an instruction that the reader should go to hell.' Battle: The extraordinary brand name was initially banned when the product was released in 2010 but the company took the fight all the way to the EU's trademark authority who eventually overturned the decision . Endorsement: An advert for the beer appeared on the website of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria . German marketing executives Stefan Fellenberg, 38, and Florian Krause, 32, who own the rights to the brand name, said they had referred to the town of F***ing in their application to register it. Location: Upper Austria . Population: 104 . Origin: Founded in the 6th century by nobleman called Lord Focko . The recent publicity earned by the Freedom Party is likely to boost the controversial beer brand's sales - bringing money to a town that often falls victim to trophy-hunters. Franz Meindl, the village's mayor, said: 'Twelve or thirteen F***ing town signs have been stolen. We've taken to fixing them with concrete, welding and rivets.' The Bavarian towns of Kissing and Petting have the same problem, as does the eastern German town of Pissen. But so far, there are no plans to name a beer after them. F***ing's unusual name is thought to derive from the sixth century noble called Lord Focko. The first known use of the English verb in a vulgar context was in 1475. The advert on the homepage goes to a website where it is possible to buy the alcohol from the neighbouring village of 'F***ing' Franz Meindl, the village's mayor, said: 'Twelve or thirteen F***ing town signs have been stolen. We've taken to fixing them with concrete, welding and rivets' The word has also been found in a dictionary dating back to 1598 - and even turns up in Shakespeare's Henry V. In 2012 residents of F***ing attempted to change the name of the village to Fugging but their bid was rejected as the suggestion was already taken. F***ing mayor Franz Meindl said that if it was not for their unfortunate name the village with just over 100 residents would be a rural paradise. He told The Mirror: 'It is beautiful countryside here, it's otherwise peaceful and we have a good community. It's only ever the name that causes us troubles.'","Extraordinary brand name was launched in 2010 and was initially banned .

"A Polish lorry driver was being interviewed by French police today after two UK-bound migrants burned to death in the back of his lorry. They are the latest in a growing list of would-be asylum seekers to die as they try to get across the Channel. The horrific tragedy took place outside a ferry terminal near Dunkirk on Wednesday evening. There was 'an explosion in the trailer' as the HGV travelling from Poland to Britain went through customs at the Loon-Plage port. 'An emergency call was made soon after 7pm,' said a local police spokesman. 'By the time firefighters reached the scene, the tarpaulin cover of the lorry trailer was alight. Scroll down for video . Would-be migrants in Calais, France, are rounded up by police. The town of Calais is home to many hoping to stowaway on lorries crossing the channel to Britain. Stock picture used . 'The driver of the lorry, who is Polish, is being interviewed.' The charred remains of the migrants, who have not been identified, suggested that they had been trying to escape following an explosion. Dunkirk prosecutor Eric Fouard confirmed that the men were 'carbonised' in the blaze, with an initial enquiry pointing towards 'an accident'. After visiting the scene, Mr Fouard said the truck, which was carrying foam insulating material, was practically destroyed. One theory is that a stray cigarette may have caused the fire, and forensic experts are carrying out tests on the remains. The incident highlights the massive dangers migrants face as they try to get to the UK in the back of lorries. A group of migrants hide next to the road as they to jump on a lorry as it slows in Calais. Stock picture used . Around 2,500 are currently massing around Calais alone, with many more in other Channel ports such as Dunkirk and Cherbourg. Last month a teenage girl hoping for a new life in Britain was killed as she ran across a motorway in Calais. The 16-year-old Ethiopian, who would have travelled some 4000 miles to get to northern France, was hit by a car on the massively busy A16 – a road always full of UK-bound trucks. French police recently increased patrols in the Calais area in a bid to control the worsening problem . Border guards regularly report hundreds of migrants hiding in shrubs along roads leading into the port, with many attempting to jump on lorries as they slow down. A Sudanese migrant was killed in June after trying to conceal himself under the axle of a British coach in a supermarket car park. And four migrants died in one week alone in March this year. On March 9 an Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port. The body of a 25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in Calais's Batellerie dock on March 14 and the next day a fellow Ethiopian in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a vehicle transporter. It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued that Britain's 'generous welfare system' is the real cause of the migrant crisis in her town. She told a House of Commons committee last month that migrants were 'prepared to die' to get their hands on UK benefits. The mainly Eritreans, Sudanese and Afghans in ports like Dunkirk Calais squat in disused buildings in Calais, or live in temporary camps - ones which the French regularly raze. Fights between rival groups have become common place, as well as disturbances involving people smugglers who charge the equivalent of around £1000 for a passage across the Channel in a lorry or car.","Two Britain-bound migrants burn to death in the back of lorry in Dunkirk .

"Max Holmes decided to slowly pull off his giant scab and uploaded the video to Youtube . Many of us have been tempted to pick off an itchy scab. But one teenager took it to a whole different level with a scab that spanned the entire length of his arm, filming as he went. The video, not for the faint-hearted, captures the moment Max Holmes slowly peels the giant scab off his arm, revealing raw and weeping skin beneath. Mr Holmes acquired the wound - that covered most of his upper arm - when he fell off his motorbike while travelling through Vietnam. The painful-looking scab is yellow-brown and crusty, with raised bits towards the centre and  patches of pink, healed skin emerging at the top. Mr Holmes decided to pull off the scab, watched by a group of jeering friends, and upload it to Youtube. ‘It’s coming off very easily,’ he says, laughing. ‘It doesn’t hurt, it’s good.’ The thin, yellow piece of scab peels away from the skin easily, catching slightly around the outline of the wound. Unhealed wet skin is revealed beneath and he holds the green flap of scab tissue, which is still intact, up to the camera. However, dermatologists have warned that picking scabs in this way leaves a person prone to infection. In worst cases, this could lead bacteria-causing gangrene to get into the cut, and the person might eventually risk amputation. Bacteria could also get into the bloodstream and travel around the body to other organs like the liver, heart or brain. It may also take longer for the wound to heal, and lead to unsightly scarring in the future. Scabs form in order to stop a cut from bleeding and to prevent harmful bacteria from getting into the body. When a person gets cut, the cells nearby release signals. One signal brings immune cells - white blood cells which travel around in the blood waiting for an attack - to the area to fight off any bacteria trying to get in through the cut. Some, called macrophages, can ‘bite’ holes in bacteria to kill them, while others ‘eat’ them and digest them with acids. Others, called B-Cells, make proteins called antibodies which surround the bacteria with helper cells and summon ‘killer’ cells to destroy them. The other signal the body sends out when a person gets cut, is for blood cells called platelets to rise from the bloodstream to the cut. The platelets stick together and react with clotting factor proteins to build a clot. The clot is made from fibrin, a stringy protein that stretches across the wound, pulling the edges together and plugs the gap between them. Dr Daron Seukeran, a consultant dermatologist at James Cook University Hospital, Middlesborough, advises not to pick a scab. Here, he explains why… . ‘A scab one level acts as protection against external agents and infection. ‘Producing a scab is nature’s way of creating a protective environment. ‘Underneath, wound healing is taking place. Wound healing takes time. ‘If you take a scab off too quickly, there’s an increased risk of secondary infection. ‘Worst case scenario is gangrene, it’s unlikely. Someone with an impaired immune system or diabetes is at an increased risk of gangrene. ‘Most people are at risk of staphylococcus, a common bacteria, which causes infection. ‘Bacteria gets into the wound and causes localised infection. ‘You may have had an impact on the process of wound healing. You could lead to an increase risk of scarring. ‘We would not advise picking scabs. You’re impacting on nature’s natural healing. ‘There is one exception. In leg ulcers, a scab can be so thick and causing contraction of the wound. Very occasionally a dermatologist would choose to remove a scab. ‘That’s rare, and the general advice is to not pick scabs.’ This helps to stop bleeding, and prevents bacteria from getting in. The scab will then fall off of its own accord when the wound has healed and the skin underneath has re-grown, dermatologists advise. Dr Daron Seukeran, a consultant dermatologist at James Cook University Hospital, Middlesborough, said a scab is 'nature's way of creating a protective environment'. He strongly advised against picking it. He said: ‘Underneath, wound healing is taking place. Wound healing takes time. ‘If you take a scab off too quickly, there’s an increased risk of secondary infection. ‘Worst case scenario is gangrene, it’s unlikely. But someone with an impaired immune system or diabetes is at an increased risk of gangrene. ‘Most people are at risk of staphylococcus, a common bacteria, which causes infection.'

'In leg ulcers, a scab can be so thick and causing contraction of the wound. Very occasionally a dermatologist would choose to remove a scab.' But he concluded: ‘That’s rare, and the general advice is to not pick scabs.’ During the video, Mr Holmes declared: ‘It’s coming off very easily.

"A shopper was dismayed to discover his local Tesco selling 22 different varieties of apples but not one of them was British. Leo Deen checked 22 different varieties of the fruit at Tesco on Hibel Road in Macclesfield for a native apple - before walking away empty handed. Instead he found fruit which had been transported thousands of miles from Chile, the U.S., New Zealand and South Africa. Leo Deen was shocked to discover his local Tesco was not selling a single variety of British apples . Mr Deen, the town’s mayor Janet Jackson and Food4Macc, a campaigning group, are now calling for stores to stock more locally-sourced produce. Mr Deen, 50, from Siddington, said: 'When I couldn’t find an English apple I had to check twice. A member of staff checked as well and admitted they had none in stock. He was clearly embarrassed. 'Supermarkets should be buying local or at least from the same country and supporting British farmers, not flying in apples from the other side of the world during peak apple season in this country.' Colin Townend, from Food4Macc, a voluntary group which campaigns for locally-produced food, called for Tesco to introduce a ‘local produce section’ in its stores. He said: 'We understand the economic drivers behind the supermarkets' buying policies, but in the same way as organic food was a specialty product a few years ago but now enjoys its own sections in supermarkets, we would like to see the supermarkets having ""local produce"" sections, exploiting the loyalty to local producers that undoubtedly exists.' A quick survey of other retailers in the town found Aldi and Sainsbury’s supermarkets both selling at least one brand of English apple, while Alan Reddy’s fruit and veg stall at the indoor market sold only English varieties. Mayor of Macclesfield, councillor Janet Jackson, carried out her own survey and found the same. She said: 'The cost of air miles for fruit brought from around the world is impacting on our economy and our climate. The Macclesfield Tesco store where Mr Deen was unable to find a single variety of British apple on sale . 'I would hope that supermarkets would, when such produce is in season in Britain, make sure that homegrown fruit is given priority. Focus on British fruit to cut down on the air miles.' A spokesman for Tesco said the Macclesfield store may have suffered an ‘off day’. He said: 'Our stocklists show Pink Lady and Bramley English varieties on sale, as well as many other British products in our fruit and vegetable section, including our tomatoes which are from Cheshire. 'At the time the customer visited we may have not had any in stock. It is possible we had an off day. 'Tesco sold more English apples and pears in 2013-14 than any other retailer. The traditional British apple season runs from September to July and our first new season British apple was in store this weekend.' Apple production tends to be associated with Kent and Herefordshire. However, Cheshire has a rich history of growing apples and boasts 33 varieties, including the Minshull Crab. Mr Deen found 22 different varieties of apples at the Tesco from these eight locations around the world . As the apple market becomes increasingly dominated by varieties originally produced overseas, there are concerns homegrown British creations are becoming harder to find. However, there are a number of British varieties which remain respected and enjoyed for their individual traits and unique flavours. Laxton's Fortune - created by the same company as Laxton's Superb - originated in Bedford in 1904. The bright red apple has a firm but coarse texture and is available in October and November. The Worcester Pearmain takes its name from its birthplace where it was introduced in 1874. Available in August and September, it has a unique strawberry-like flavour and tastes sweet. In terms of cooking, the British Bramley apple is regarded at the world's finest. The variety, first produced in Nottinghamshire about 200 years ago, is available throughout the year and has an ability to retain its taste during cooking. Cox's Orange Pippin is a highly regarded eating apple and was first produced in Buckinghamshire by horticulturalist Richard Cox. It is said to be aromatic and juicy.","Leo Deen found 22 types of apples in local Tesco but none of them British .

"A gun enthusiast from Austria who was attending an SAS-style boot camp drove all the way to the Brecon Beacons with a car full of lethal weapons - and wasn't stopped by a single official. Manuel Wallner boarded a ferry in Calais while his car was loaded with an arsenal of weapons, including a rifle, two semi-automatic guns and 280 rounds of ammunition. The 23-year-old had enrolled on a 'close protection' course in the Welsh national park, where the most lethal weapon due to be used was a rubber knife. But he decided to bring along his own huge collection of weapons - and managed to drive all the way to Crickhowell with them in tow. Manuel Wallner, 23, boarded a ferry in Calais while his car was loaded with an arsenal of weapons, including a rifle, two semi-automatic guns and 280 rounds of ammunition - but his car was not checked by officials . A judge at Swansea Crown Court today said there had been a 'gaping hole' in security that allowed Wallner to carry out his journey. The court heard Wallner had declared his boot-full of weapons to officials on the French border - but had been waved onto the ferry without his car being inspected. Officials failed to pass the message about his stash on to British authorities, meaning no one ever checked inside Wallner's car. The young man only found himself being arrested when two fellow course goers reported him to the instructor after he boasted to them about his extensive collection. The arsenal included a Steys Aug semi automatic .223 rifle, a semi automatic Beretta .9mm pistol,  knives, a tomahawk, extendable baton, gas mask, body armour and balaclavas. Speaking at Swansea Crown Court, judge Keith Thomas said: 'The facts are serious and worrying. If everything had worked properly that information should have been relayed to the UK. 'He was not stopped or questioned in anyway by the UK authorities. It is worrying. The real issue that disturbs me is that no-one appears to think that someone should have done something. I hope that something can be done about it.' Wallner appeared at the court for sentencing after admitting nine offences of possessing illegal weapons. During the hearing, the court heard Wallner, who had hoped to work in personal security in Iraq or South America, enrolled on the £4,200 close protection and hostile environment operation course run by the Blue Mountain Group. The BMG told Wallner to bring with him necessary equipment such as warm and wet weather clothing. But Wallner decided to take along part of his personal collection of weapons. Patrick Griffiths, prosecuting, said that had Wallner successfully applied in Austria for a European Firearms Pass, which would supposedly allow him to take guns into the UK. Wallner was attending a £4,200 survival course in the Brecon Beacons, mid Wales (pictured) when his fellow course-goers grew concerned about his extensive weapon collection . But Mr Griffiths said that in fact the pass did not override the laws of individual countries and that guns and ammunition were 'definitely illegal' in the UK. He told the court that Wallner had informed border officials about the arms in the boot of his car when he arrived in Calais. He was then told to wait until a member of the French forces spoke to him and inspected the guns, but the official did not turn up. A representative of the French-owned firm myferrylink then told him to drive on to the boat, lock his car and give the keys to a crew member. As the ship neared Dover, Wallner went back to his car, where he was given his keys back and told to 'drive on'. Mr Griffiths said myferrylink had by then placed a 'Code 100' mark on Wallner's travel details, flagging up the contents of his car to the authorities. The consequences should have been that the French security forces at least spoke to Wallner and told the British he was on his way, he added. But in Dover, Wallner drove through the green 'nothing to declare' corridor without being stopped. Judge Thomas at Swansea Crown Court (pictured) said there had been a 'gaping hole' in border security . He then drove onto Llangynidr, a village at the foot of the Brecon Beacons 300 miles away. There he was booked into the Coach House hotel, where he met fellow course goers Mark Wilson and Anthony Meachum. Mr Griffiths told the court: 'They were surprised to discover he had brought with him an arsenal of weapons, ammunition and body armour. He made no secret about what he had, and even laid it all out in his bedroom for them to see.' The two men, both ex-forces, became uneasy and told the instructor about the weapons, who called the police. Wallner was sentenced to 18 months' jail, suspended for two years, after telling Mr Thomas he planned to return to Austria as soon as possible. The judge told Wallner he accepted that he had 'declared the weapons to the French border authority and the ferry company'. He also said he believed he had taken 'all reasonable steps to find out if he could bring the weapons into the UK'. Wallner's guns, ammunition, knives, tomahawk and baton were confiscated. He also lost his £4,200 course fee, and was ordered to pay a £100 government surcharge. A spokesman for myferrylink said after the case: 'A Code 100 is a standard code used by all ferry companies to indicate there are firearms aboard a vehicle. It is for the authorities to take notice if they want to.' A spokesman for the UK Border Force said it was the responsibility of the person importing the firearms into the country to notify the relevant authority.","Manuel Wallner was attending a survival course in the Brecon Beacons .

"The BBC has today been accused of turning Question Time into a ‘joke’ after footballer Joey Barton compared voting for Ukip to picking up ugly girls in a nightclub. In a heated exchange on the flagship political show the Queens Park Rangers midfielder told a newly elected female Ukip MEP her party was just the least unattractive option. To gasps from the audience, he told her: ‘You won the election? You won seats in the European Parliament that nobody really cares about'. ‘All you represent to me as Ukip is the . best of a bad bunch. If I’m somewhere and there are four really ugly . girls and I’m thinking she is not the worst, that is all you represent . to us.’ Scroll down for video . Poor choice of words: Footballer Joey Barton compared voting Ukip to picking up ugly girls in a club . Attacks: Tory MP Stuart Andrew criticsed the programme . Out of his comfort zone: More used to kicking a ball in front of huge crowds, Barton admitted he was nervous . Louise Bours, an MEP for north west England, angrily responded, saying: ‘What an offensive thing to say. The ignorance that you spout it illustrates that footballers’ brains are in their feet.’ Mr Barton blamed his remarks on being . nervous, saying he'd prefer 'Wembley and 87,000 any day of the week', . but his performance has been called a 'new low' for the show. Viewers last night criticised the BBC for its choice of panellists - who also included former newspaper editor Piers Morgan - as MPs from both sides of the political spectrum condemned the programme and Barton’s joke. Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, Horsforth and Aireborough, tweeted: ‘BBC Question Time has become a joke.’ And Lucy Powell, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Childcare and Children, added: ‘Very unfortunate analogy there Joey.’ Making his point: Barton's first contribution was to say that the support for UKIP was a protest vote . Indignant: Ukip MEP Louise Bours, left, said that Barton's comment was 'offensive' Controversy: Barton's 'four ugly girls' analogy did not go down well with the audience and on social media . The top table: Barton was joined on the panel at Heathrow Terminal 2 by Piers Morgan (left) Another Twitter user wrote: ‘Well Question Time has hit a new low with Joey Barton on the panel.’ While one posted: ‘Piers Morgan and Joey Barton on Question Time, wow it feels like some kind of Comic Relief spin-off joke.’ An audience member later confronted Barton about his remark. saying: 'I was with you in some of the things you said (but) I think the analogy you made of four ugly girls, that's going to be on Twitter tonight and tomorrow, you'll be buried for it.' Barton replied: 'I do apologise - I couldn't think of a better one, this is the first time I have ever done it (Question Time). 'As Louise rightly pointed out my brains are in my feet, which is an equally offensive statement. 'Maybe I was a little bit nervous, I apologise.' Afterwards Barton took to Twitter, telling fellow panellist, former News of the World editor Piers Morgan: 'I may have upset one or two women with an ill conceived metaphor. £imnewtothis.' He later added: 'Should have left it at 'Best of a bad bunch' Ah well £imnewtothis @bbcquestiontime.' A BBC spokesman said: 'Joey Barton was robustly challenged on his comments by both the panel and the audience. He apologised on the programme, putting his comment down to nerves. Question Time often features journalists, comedians, campaigners and other public figures to add a different perspective to the panel.' Barton, who was called 'football's philosopher king' at the start of the show, is well known for holding court on political issues on Twitter. But he has a checkered history on and off the football pitch. Mixed reviews: The QPR midfielder's performance on the BBC led to a huge reaction Twitter, good and bad . Losing respect: One fan described the moment as a 'new low' for the flagship panel show . Rowing back: Barton later apologised on Twitter as well, claiming that he is 'new to' being a panelist . Earlier yesterday, the Liberal Democrats . criticised the BBC for not having a representative from their party . despite speculation over the leadership of Nick Clegg leading the week’s . headlines. Its press office aired its frustration at not being including on the show – which last night had representatives from the Conservatives, Labour and Ukip - by tweeting: ‘@bbcquestiontime have refused to take a Liberal Democrat panellist tonight.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The Question Time panel is chosen carefully across the series and the Liberal Democrat party has appeared on every edition of Question time in the last six weeks. ‘As with the other political parties, the Liberal Democrats will again be invited to appear on the programme in the near future.’ Dinner time: Piers Morgan posted this photo of Barton and David Dimbleby and wrote: 'All smiles over #BBCQT dinner. Have to say - Le Pitbull @Joey7Barton is great company. For an ugly bloke.' Barton has a controversial history, which includes being jailed for six months in 2008 for assault and affray. He was captured on CCTV in Liverpool punching one man 20 times before an attack which left a teenage boy with broken teeth. He also once stubbed a cigar into the eye of a team-mate at a Christmas party. DECEMBER 2004: Stubs lit cigar in the eye of young team-mate Jamie Tandy during . City's Christmas party.

"Labour and disability charities are facing a growing public backlash for making a ‘disgusting spectacle’ of remarks by a Government minister about minimum pay for disabled workers. Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle looked shocked as a BBC Question Time audience turned on her when she demanded that welfare reform minister Lord Freud should resign or be sacked. She insisted the peer had been ‘offensive’ in remarks secretly recorded by a Labour official at a fringe meeting of last month’s Conservative Party conference. Scroll down for video . Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle on Question Time when she demanded Lord Freud be sacked . Lord Freud was responding to a councillor with a severely disabled daughter who suggested that people with mental health problems may be unable to work because employers are unwilling to pay them the statutory minimum. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘not worth’ the £6.50 minimum wage and mused on whether the Government might be able to top up their wages to enable more to get into workplaces. Labour leader Ed Miliband ambushed David Cameron with a transcript of the recording at Prime Minister’s Questions this week, also insisting the minister should be sacked. He has remained in his job after apologising, but Miss Eagle insisted on Thursday night: ‘I do think he should resign. I think what he said… has caused a great deal of offence to disabled people. ‘There are 50 per cent of people with disabilities who are not in work at the moment. The answer to that isn’t to somehow weaken the minimum wage and make them work for less than the minimum wage.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on the programme it was clear Lord Freud had been talking about the state ‘topping up’ the incomes of disabled people. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘not worth’ the £6.50 minimum wage . One audience member agreed: ‘I think Angela Eagle is being extremely disingenuous. I think we all knew what he meant, even though he said it clumsily.’ Another person in the audience in Newbury, Berkshire, told Miss Eagle: ‘What you are doing is hypocritical point scoring and it’s disgusting.’ A young woman said: ‘I just wanted to see whether you [Eagle] would use this as a political football and you have done – thanks Angela.’ Yesterday a Conservative MP also defended Lord Freud, insisting that the minimum wage was having a detrimental impact on disabled people’s chances of finding work. Jackie Doyle-Price, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said the way Lord Freud’s remarks had been twisted by Labour and parts of the charitable sector was ‘frankly disgusting’. It emerged the charity Mencap, which has led criticism of Lord Freud, itself warned an estimated 1,000 people with severe learning disabilities had part-time jobs or had their working hours cut as a direct result of the national minimum wage. In 2000, it called for an urgent revision of the rules to enable ‘low output work’ to be exempted from the rules. It now says the system to support disabled people into work has been transformed in the last 15 years and debate has moved on, ‘as has our position’. Conservative MP Henry Smith said: ‘Certain charities have seemed quick to make political attacks on what is a very serious and complex issue. Charities should not be acting as mouthpieces for Labour’s political point scoring.’ Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, whose wife Margaret was badly disabled in the Brighton bomb, said the attacks on Lord Freud were a ‘disgusting spectacle’. ‘What Lord Freud was being asked about was whether there are handicapped people who cannot produce enough to justify in purely economic terms a wage of £6 an hour. My wife was capable of earning her pay as an experienced nurse until the sadistic criminals of IRA/Sinn Fein crippled her. She is worth no less today, but she could not justify a pay rate of £6 an hour. Lord Freud was mulling over how to help such people.’ Labour's Department for Trade and Industry published guidance in 2003 on when and where it might be acceptable to pay disabled people far less than the minimum wage. The department, then run by Patricia Hewitt, said the minimum wage applied to all workers – able-bodied or disabled. However, disabled people could be exempted from the minimum wage when they did work-related activity for therapeutic reasons, with no contractual obligation to work. The guidance gave various examples of when that could apply, after the Government consulted with organisations including Scope, Mencap and the TUC. It gave the example of a farm where people develop social skills through involvement in agriculture, horticulture, caring for animals and training. Other examples included a charity running a workshop for people with mental health problems, which it suggested, could pay them as little as £4 per day. A third example was a trust running a facility for mental health outpatients which does activities such as packing and assembly. They could be paid varying amounts up to just £20 per week.","Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle appeared on BBC Question Time .

"David Cameron today insisted emergency legislation is needed to allow Britain’s spies to access data about the public’s phone calls, texts and emails. The Prime Minister said new laws are needed to reinstate powers to 'help keep us safe from those who would harm UK citizens'. The laws - drawn up with backing from the Tories, Lib Dems and Labour - will be rushed through Parliament amid mounting concern about the threat posed to the UK by jihadists returning from fighting in Syria. David Cameron and Nick Clegg today announced plans for emergency spy laws at a press conferencein Number 10 . The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have struck a deal with Labour to pass laws which will last for two years forcing phone companies to keep records of calls and texts for 12 months . An emergency Cabinet meeting was held early this morning, and Mr Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg held a rare joint press conference in Downing Street. In the Commons, Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs: 'Without this legislation, we face the prospect of losing access to this data overnight with the consequence police investigations will suddenly go dark and criminals will escape justice. We cannot allow that to happen.' Ministers insist the powers are not new, but will maintain the existing ability for the police and spy agencies to access data held by telecommunications companies. Rather, it is intended to protect the ‘capability’ which the likes of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 are on the brink of losing. The emergency Data Retention and Investigation Powers Bill will be rushed onto the statute book next week, after cross-party talks between Mr Cameron, his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband. But critics condemned the 'stitch-up' which will see the laws 'railroaded' through Parliament with little scrutiny. Speaking alongside Mr Clegg in Downing Street this morning, the Prime Minister said the new laws were needed to catch terrorists and criminals. He said: 'Unless we act now companies will no longer retain the data about who contacted who, where and when and we will no longer be able to use this information to bring criminals to justice and keep our country safe.' Mr Clegg insisted 'liberty and security must go hand in hand' as he gave Lib Dem backing to the plans . Home Secretary Theresa May announced the emergency laws in the Commons today. She said people could not have freedom without security . What powers do the police and MI5 have? In the wake of the July 7 attacks, an EU directive meant telephone and internet companies have been obliged to keep customer records for 12 months. It covered details of the time, date and recipient of phone calls, texts and emails, but not the content. It is essentially what you might see on your monthly phone bill: Who you called and when, but not what you said. Security agencies argue it has proved crucial in smashing a series of terrorist plots, as well as organised crime syndicates and paedophile groups. So what has changed? The directive was ruled unlawful by the European Court of Justice in April this year. Its implementation by the Labour government in 2009 was said to be invalid because it interferes in a particularly serious manner with the fundamental right to respect for private life. As a result, ministers given a strict deadline to re-write UK law or stop using the spy powers. What will new the laws mean? Ministers insist it replicates what was in place before April. It does not cover the content of calls or emails, which requires a warrant signed off by the Home Secretary. Isn't this the snoopers' charter? The government insists not. The powers involved have been in place since 2006. The so-called snoopers' charter, proposed by the Tories two years ago, was an extension of those powers. It would have covered details of every website which was clicked on, as well as direct messages on Facebook and Twitter and information exchanged between players in online video games. Mr Cameron added: It is used in 95 per cent or all serious organised crime cases handled by the CPS. 'It's been used in every major security service counter-terrorism investigation over the past decade. It is the foundation for prosecutions of paedophiles, drug dealers and fraudsters.' The Prime Minister said some companies were already refusing to work with the Government over fears they could be sued. He added: 'We face real and credible threats to our security from serious and organised crime, from the activity of paedophiles, from the collapse of Syria, the growth of Isis in Iraq and al Shabab in East Africa. 'I am simply not prepared to be a prime minister who has to address the people after a terrorist incident and explain that I could have done more to prevent it.' Earlier, Mr Cameron said: 'It is the first duty of government to protect our national security and to act quickly when that security is compromised. 'As events in Iraq and Syria demonstrate, now is not the time to be scaling back on our ability to keep our people safe. 'The ability to access information about communications and intercept the communications of dangerous individuals is essential to fight the threat from criminals and terrorists targeting the UK. 'No government introduces fast track legislation lightly. But the consequences of not acting are grave. 'I want to be very clear that we are not introducing new powers or capabilities – that is not for this Parliament. 'This is about restoring two vital measures ensuring that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies maintain the right tools to keep us all safe.' The new law will expire in 2016, when the next government will have to revisit the issue. After weeks of negotiations between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, agreement has now been reached to re-instate the powers. This will be done by writing them directly into British law rather than relying on the now unlawful 2006 EU data retention directive. Tory ministers remain adamant that further powers are needed to reflect changes in technology since 2006 - but accept this will now have to wait until after the 2015 General Election. The Liberal Democrats remain implacably opposed to the so-called ‘snoopers’ charter’ – which would have given police and spy agencies even greater powers to monitor every telephone call, email and internet search in Britain. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'We know the consequences of not acting are serious, but this urgency will not be used as an excuse for more powers, or for a ‘snooper’s charter’. 'I believe that successive governments have neglected civil liberties in the pursuit of greater security. We will be the first Government in many decades to increase transparency and oversight, and make significant progress in defence of liberty. 'But Liberty and security must go hand in hand. We can’t enjoy our freedom if we’re unable to keep ourselves safe.' Under the plans announced today, a new Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board will be created to balance individual freedom against the need to tackle threats to national security and serious crimes. Some public bodies including the Royal Mail and the pensions regulator will lose their right to ask phone and web companies for the records. Others, including councils, will have their access to records limited. Annual transparency reports will be published to show hoe surveillance powers are being used. Home Secretary Theresa May arrives in Downing Street to brief an emergency Cabinet meeting on the new laws . The emergency laws will be passed by Parliament next week after a deal between Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband . Police and spy agencies argue that being able to see who criminal suspects - or their victims - have called or emailed has played a crucial role in almost every major investigation. They claim it s particularly important for targeting serious criminals, including drug dealers, paedophiles and fraudsters. Downing Street said the killers of Liverpool schoolboy Rhys Jones, a gang of men who groomed young girls in Rochdale and a drugs gang operating in Merseyside, Lancashire, Glasgow and South Wales in 2011 were all caught in part as a result of using mobile phone records. The government says it has also been used to stop crimes in while they are still in progress and save lives. But civil liberties groups say it is an extension of the surveillance state which treats everyone as a potential criminal. Senior Labour MP Tom Watson condemned the way the laws were being rushed without giving Parliament chance to scrutinise it properly. ‘The government were aware of this European Court of Justice ruling six weeks ago and what we are seeing now is they are railroading through legislation,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘No-one in civic society has got a chance to form a view on this. It’s a stitch-up. ‘It is a secret deal between the three parties and it will go through next week as they have done this deal.’ Jim Killock, head of the Open Rights Group, said: 'The government knows that since the CJEU ruling, there is no legal basis for making internet service providers retain our data so it is using the threat of terrorism as an excuse for getting this law passed. 'The Government has had since April to address the CJEU ruling but it is only now that organisations such as ORG are threatening legal action that this has become an 'emergency'.' The laws are intended to protect the 'capability' which the likes of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 are on the brink of losing . These three men all claim to have come from Britain and feature in an ISIS video featuring young British jihadists encouraging Muslims in the West to join them in Iraq and Syria . In a speech last month, Home Secretary Theresa May said the security services need new surveillance powers to counter the ‘real and deadly’ threat from jihadists. She said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had created a haven for terrorists just a few hours from London by plane. At the same time, the internet has become a ‘paradise’ for terrorists and criminals who can operate out of the reach of the authorities. But Mrs May added that the powers used to defeat Britain’s enemies were not keeping up with new technology, leading to a collapse in Britain’s capacity to protect its citizens. Later this year, a report by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee into the murder of the soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, southeast London, is expected to argue that - had MI5 had greater internet surveillance powers - it could have helped to thwart the plot.","Prime Minister insists police and spy agencies must retain snooping powers .

"The prosecutor in the trial of Rolf Harris is to lead an official probe into allegations the Government conspired to cover up child abuse on a British overseas territory. Sasha Wass QC will lead an investigation into claims there was widespread paedophile abuse on the remote South Atlantic island of St Helena, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond announced today. He said the allegations involve claims relating to child abuse in the territory, police corruption and incompetence and a ‘conspiracy’ by the St Helena government, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development to ‘cover these up’. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told MPs a top lawyer would investigate claims of a child abuse cover up . Former employees of the St Helena government raised fresh concerns in July, which followed a number of allegations in recent years about child safety and police corruption. In a written statement to MPs, Mr Hammond said: ‘These allegations involve claims relating to child abuse in the territory, police corruption and incompetence, and a conspiracy by the St Helena government (SHG), the FCO and DfiD to cover these up. 'We are bound to take such allegations extremely seriously.’ He added: ‘I am pleased to inform the House that I have agreed that Ms Sasha Wass QC should lead this inquiry. ‘Ms Wass is a very accomplished barrister with substantial professional experience of dealing with these kinds of issues. I am confident that she will lead this inquiry with great rigour, fairness and sensitivity. ‘Matters of child safety require discretion and confidentiality. The issues self-evidently involve vulnerable people, whose privacy must be protected and confidences respected. I am certain this inquiry will do that. But it is also important that this process is as transparent as possible.’ Jamestown, the main settlement on the remote South Atlantic island of St Helena at the foot of Jacobs Ladder . Mr Hammond said Ms Wass will conduct an initial review of the allegations contained in various documents, including independent reports produced by others in response to specific concerns raised previously. He said: ‘We are also providing Sasha Wass with full disclosure of the UK papers that relate to these allegations. Ms Wass will then make a judgment about the scope of her investigations, including on the appointment of a team of independent experts to help her with this task. ‘I also understand that Ms Wass will travel to St Helena once this initial phase of her work is completed.’ Mr Hammond reiterated investigations had taken place since allegations linked to child safety were first raised in late 2012. He noted a number of arrests and convictions for child sex offences have also taken place. Mr Hammond added: ‘More, however, needs to be done. This new Inquiry will not be quick. But it will be thorough. ‘And I am confident that the facts will be established.’ Details of the latest allegations first emerged in July following written questions in Parliament from Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming. He asked the Foreign Office (FCO) to disclose what information it had received about allegations of child abuse and police corruption on St Helena since May 2010. Mr Hemming also questioned what steps the department had taken to ensure the opening of an airport on the island does not lead to the ‘development of child sex tourism’ in the territory. The probe comes after a report by UK child protection charity The Lucy Faithfull Foundation found St Helena was rife with child sexual abuse, domestic violence and sexual exploitation . He was informed that new allegations had surfaced and that former foreign secretary William Hague agreed to set up an independent panel of experts to investigate them before leaving his post. Former Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds also said: ‘The FCO and Dfid (Department for International Development) have been working closely with the UK police who have investigated reports into child sex abuse on St Helena and continue to do so.’ Ms Wass was prosecuting lawyer in the case of disgraced entertainer Harris, who was convicted of 12 indecent assaults at London’s Southwark Crown Court in June - one on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens, and a catalogue of abuse against his daughter’s friend over 16 years.","Sasha Wass to lead probe into allegations of paedophile abuse on island .

"Police are searching the compound of controversial 'godman' Rampal Maharaj for explosives after he was arrested following a bloody siege on the 12-acre property. Rampal was arrested at his sprawling compound in northern India overnight, ending a days-long standoff in which six people died and hundreds were injured. The hugely popular religious leader, who considers himself the reincarnation of a 15th century mystic poet, was wanted on murder charges and had repeatedly ignored court summons. This led to police storming the fortified compound with tear gas, water cannons and batons in an assault met with fierce opposition from thousands of Rampal's devoted followers. Scroll down for video . Rampal Maharaj pictured behind bars after the 10-day long confrontation between police and his disciples . 'Godman' Rampal (pictured as he is escorted to court) refused to answer to court summons and police had no choice but to raid the sprawling compound where he lived among thousands of devotees .

A policeman keeps watch as dozens of Rampal's followers stream out of the compound's main gate . A woman wanders past dozens of policemen, who have spent two days laying siege to the compound . The compound remains a mess after followers clashed with police and arrested more than 500 people . Jawahar Yadav, a Haryana state government spokesman, said police had arrested Rampal and taken him away in an ambulance. No violence or confrontation took place between his supporters and the police at the time of his arrest, Yadav told reporters. More than 500 of his supporters were also arrested and another 15,000 evacuated from the 12-acre compound before he was taken into custody. Rampal said he regretted the deaths, but denied police allegations he used his followers as human shields. 'I did not use them (as shields). They were acting on their own,' he said after being taken into police custody. Police also have filed fresh charges against him and some of his supporters, including sedition, murder, criminal conspiracy and detaining people illegally in his fortress.

The bodies of five women and a baby were later taken from the compound . Police spray Rampal's supporters with water cannons as they storm the 12-acre compound, despite fierce resistance . Police, armed with heavy sticks, drag a bloody man away from the scene of the violent clashes . During the siege, police said they arrested more than 500 devotees, including 250 members of a 'private army' dedicated to his protection. 'It was a tough operation, we had to deal with hostile supporters,' police inspector Anil Kumar said. 'At the moment we are trying to clear the ashram, the clearing operations are on, our personnel are inside the ashram. They are trying to find if any explosives have been hidden there.' Police believe around 2,000 followers are still inside the 12-acre compound and officers using loudspeakers today urged them to come out. Supporters of Rampal Maharaj hold a poster of him during a non-violent protest in New Dehli . A man stands up to pray during the protest. The New Dehli demonstration (pictured) was in stark contrast to the violent scenes at Rampal's compound 170km northeast of the city . Indian police use batons and water cannons to disperse supporters at the sprawling compound . A group of police wearing helmets, padding and armed with heavy sticks, prepare to engage with Rampal's supporters . Shriniwas Vashisht, director-general of police in Haryana, said many of the thousands of people holed up with Rampal were held against their will or were used as human shields to prevent police action. 'They know that we will not allow innocent women and children to be caught in the crossfire and they are taking advantage of that.' Authorities earlier tried to flush him out by cutting off electricity and water to the compound. Thousands of people began streaming out of the compound yesterday, and many said armed followers of the guru had prevented them from leaving earlier. 'They closed and locked the gates inside the compound and would not let us out,' said Birender Satya, who had traveled from central India with his mother to listen to Rampal's preaching. Another member, Jawan Singh, said he had gone into the ashram in the hope that Rampal could cure his chronic back pain, but devotees prevented him from leaving. 'I came here hoping that I'll get healed. Instead it was a war-like situation here,' the 34-year-old said from the window of a bus that was taking people away from the compound. 'The guards manning the complex gate didn't allow us to come out. They told the people to go back in.' Four hundred people were arrested by police during the clashes. Here two of Rampal's supporters are dragged away . Rampal is a self-styled 'godman', who believes he is a reincarnation of the 15th century mystic poet Kabir. Here, police are pictured detaining one of his supporters . Rampal and 38 others have been charged with murder and other offenses after a clash between his supporters and another group killed one person in July 2006. He was freed on bail, which was canceled after his followers entered a courtroom and threatened lawyers in July. Yesterday the guru's followers handed over to police the bodies of four women who apparently died inside the   complex, about 175 kilometers from New Delhi. Earlier in the day, a woman and an 18-month-old child died in a hospital after leaving the ashram. India has been rocked by several scandals involving immensely popular 'godmen', mostly Hindu ascetics who claim to possess mystical powers. Last year one was charged with sexually assaulting a schoolgirl. For many Indians, gurus play an integral role in daily life. They say they offer a pathway to enlightenment in return for spiritual devotion and often give donations to ashrams, temples and charity projects.","Indian police arrest 'godman' Rampal Maharaj at his sect's fortress .

"Hero RAF helicopter pilot Marc Heal is hoping to raise £30,000  just four years after the Queen presented him with the Distinguished Flying Cross for 'outstanding gallantry and courage' A hero pilot who helped save 29 soldiers in some of the most intense fighting of the Afghan war is selling his prestigious bravery medal. Flight Lieutenant Marc Heal, 34,was presented him with the Distinguished Flying Cross by the Queen for his act of 'outstanding gallantry and courage'. The RAF officer, who has also been given the freedom of his home city, dodged bullets and bombs to fly his Chinook helicopter in and out of a battle zone to rescue wounded men. On one of the eight incredibly-risky flights, the landing site was hit by a mortar shell just moments after Fl Lt Heal took off. Over three days he transported 29 British and Afghan troops to Camp Bastion for emergency treatment after battles with the Taliban. Only 22 DFCs were awarded for the Afghan war. Fl Lt Heal is now auctioning his medal group for an estimated £30,000 to raise money for his family. Steven Bosley, of Bosley's Auctions of Marlow, Bucks, said: 'He was a very brave man. It wasn't just a single act of courage, he put his life on the line time and again over a three day period. 'Unlike the Military Cross, there weren't many DFCs given for Afghanistan which is why they tend to command a high price when they come up for sale. Fl Lt Heal served with the RAF's 18 Squadron and was on his fifth tour of Afghanistan when Operation Panther's Claw was carried out in July 2009. The British-led mission was aimed at securing a number of canal and river crossings but resulted in heavy casualties. Fl Lt Heal was honoured for his hero missions with the RAF in which he was awarded, shown from left to right, the Distinguished Flying Cross, Operational Service Medal, NATO Medal and the EIIR Diamond Jubilee Medal . Each time Fl Lt Heal flew into the war zone it was under a hail of bullets from the enemy and without an escort gunship. He said: 'We went into a landing site where the enemy was right on top of our guys. 'When we lifted off for the second time a mortar round came in, just missing us and falling on our landing site we'd just taken off from. 'Because that created more casualties on the ground we had no choice but to drop off those onboard at the hospital and then go straight back to the same landing site, even though we had just seen it mortared.' Hero RAF helicopter pilot Marc Heal is hoping to raise £30,000 to emigrate to America just four years after the Queen presented him with the Distinguished Flying Cross for his act of 'outstanding gallantry and courage' After touching down for a third time, Fl Lt Heal received radio messages informing him the enemy had advanced to within 200 yards of his Chinook but he had no choice but to wait until more men had been loaded on board. His DFC medal group along with his RAF officer's tunic and a scroll granting Fl Lt Heal with the freedom on his home city of Brighton and Hove are being sold tomorrow.

"A U.S. warship has been damaged after it collided with a fully-loaded oil tanker in the early hours of Sunday morning close to the politically sensitive Strait of Hormuz. The collision left a gaping hole in the starboard side of USS Porter but no one was injured on either vessel, the U.S. Navy said in a statement. Japanese-owned bulk oil tanker M/V Otowasan and the guided-missile destroyer hit each other at around 1am local time. They both pulled up in in the sea as engineers made frantic efforts to secure the damage. Investigations were continuing this morning into how the two ships came to collide in an area of sea that has been the focus on intense political tensions between Iran and the west. Carnage: The damage on the starboard side of USS Porter after it hit a Japanese-owned oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz . Darkness: The collision happened in the middle of the night but was not combat related, officials say . However, officials said that the crash was not combat related. Radar failure, human error or engine malfunction are all possible explanations for the incident. The sonar equipment used on the U.S. ship is likely to be far more advanced than that used on the oil tanker, raising the possibility that the oil ship struck the naval boat. The cause of the incident is under investigation, the Navy said, adding that there were no reports of spills or leakages from either the USS Porter or the Otowasan. 'Both vessels are okay and the Strait of Hormuz is not closed, and business is as usual there,"" an Oman coastguard official said. The USS Porter is on a scheduled deployment to the U.S. 5th Fleet, which is based in Bahrain. The oil tanker, owned by Japan's Mitsui OSK, was bound for the United Arab Emirates port of Fujairah from Mesaieed in Qatar, according to ship tracking websites. Shocking: Engineers battle to fix the ill-fated ship after the collision. Investigations are ongoing into how the two vessels came to collide . Steaming ahead: The USS Porter is on a scheduled deployment to the U.S. 5th Fleet, which is based in Bahrain . It can hold two million barrels of oil and was understood to be 95 per cent full at the time of the smash. The Strait of Hormuz, located at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, is where one-fifth of the world's oil is routed. The area was at the centre of tough . negotiations earlier this year as Iran threatened to blockade the . passage in a row over U.S. sanctions imposed on the country, due to its . nuclear programme. Tensions . have risen there over Iran's threats to block tanker traffic in . retaliation for tighter sanctions by the West. Washington says it . maintains naval forces in the Gulf to ensure security in the region. If attacked, Iran could severely disrupt oil supplies and send the shaky global economy stumbling backward again. Three years ago, the USS Hartford, a nuclear-powered submarine based in Groton, Connecticut, collided in the Strait with the USS New Orleans, a San Diego-based amphibious ship. Tensions: An Iranian 200-kilometre (120-mile) range Qader (Ghader) ground-to-sea missile is launched druing war games near the Strait of Hormuz earlier this year . Show of strength: Iranian naval ships take part in a naval parade on the last day of the Velayat-90 war game in the Sea of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz in southern Iran . The New Orleans' fuel tank was ruptured and 15 sailors on the Hartford sustained minor injuries. The collision caused $2.3 million in damage to the New Orleans, and the cost so far of repairs to the Hartford is $102.6 million. The commanding officer was relieved of his duties and the sub's chief of the boat, an adviser to the commanding officer, was reassigned. Several crew members were punished.","Warship and Japanese-owned oil tanker collide in Strait of Hormuz .

"Lynda Bellingham's son has claimed a simple test may have detected his mother's fatal colon cancer in time to save her life. Speaking for the first time since the actress's death last month, Michael Peluso said he believed a colonoscopy should have been carried out as it would have given her longer to live. The 31-year-old added routine screening tests had failed to pick up his mother's  illness for 18 months, leaving it too late for her to recover once diagnosed. Scroll down for video . Lynda Bellingham's son Michael Peluso believes a simple colonoscopy would have saved his mother's life . In her final interview on ITV's Loose Women, the 66-year-old urged over 60s to undergo the procedure as her disease had gone undetected for months . 'She was a massive champion for getting a colonoscopy... it would have saved her life,' Mr Peluso told the Daily Mirror. 'They missed it so much. She was carrying cancer for 18 months before she discovered she had it.' Ms Bellingham's health deteriorated drastically within weeks of bravely revealing she had chosen to stop treatment to enjoy a final Christmas with her sons and husband. Chronicling her battle with the disease in her book, There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell You, the 66-year-old even told of how she'd chosen the day she would die. The beloved actress, best known for her role as the Oxo mum and as a host on Loose Women, died on October 19, days after describing her battle with colon cancer on the ITV talk show. Ms Bellingham chronicled her battle with the disease in a book. Since her death, husband Michael Pattemore  (right) thanked fans and well-wishers for buying There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell You . Mr Peluso, pictured at his mother's funeral with brother Robbie (right) and Mr Pattemore (left), previously thanked the public for their 'overwhelming' support . Mr Peluso acted opposite his mother in the film Too Close For Comfort 2 in the months before her death. In a poignant scene, Ms Bellingham tells him she has been diagnosed with cancer . Colon cancer is also referred to as bowel cancer or rectal cancer. In countries such as the UK and U.S., more than 80 per cent of cases occur in people aged 60 or over, such as Lynda. People who are older, who eat a diet low in fibre and high in fat, those who are overweight and those who take little exercise are most at risk. Smoking, alcohol and a family history of the disease also increase the risk. The cancer can present itself in a number of ways, explains Dr Stuart Riley, a consultant gastroenterologist, and clinical director of the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in South Yorkshire. ‘The usual symptoms are rectal bleeding, a change in bowel habits - usually looser stools, though it could also cause constipation or needing to go to the toilet more frequently - abdominal discomfort and anaemia.’ He says if any bleeding is accompanied by a change in bowel habits, or if any other signs persist for several months, then a ‘full clinical assessment’ should be carried out. This includes a colonoscopy - where a tiny camera is inserted into the colon. It’s also important to establish if a patient has a family history of bowel cancer as this can increase the risk. In the UK routine screening tests are offered to over 60s by the NHS. Those eligible are sent home stool testing kits designed to detect the disease. If stool tests return an abnormal result, the patient is invited to undergo a colonoscopy. This is the case for only two in every 100 patients, according to the NHS. In a final interview, the 66-year-old urged people her age to undergo colonoscopies routinely and have regular stool tests. 'The minute you’re diagnosed it’s too late. I knew I was stage four 15 months ago, so it was quite hard when people said, “Oh, your chemo will be finished soon. Don’t worry,""' she said. 'I always had a stool test and had always gone for a check up but this [cancer] hides. Advising viewers of how best to detect the disease, she said: 'I would say get checked up, but the biggest thing... if you put a pound away for a colonoscopy when you get to 60, they actually do say that’s probably the only way of knowing for sure that you have got bowel cancer.' Mr Peluso, Ms Bellingham's son from her second marriage to Nunzo Peluso, has not spoken out formally since his mother's death in October. Last week emotional footage of the pair emerged, with Ms Bellingham playing her son's on-screen mother in the film Too Close For Comfort 2. In one poignant scene, the 66-year-old tells her son she has been diagnosed with cancer. In the days after his mother's death Mr Peluso took to social media to express his grief and thank the public for their 'overwhelming' outpouring of support. 'Oh mama miss u so much', he posted on Twitter, before thanking well-wishers for their messages. 'Thank you everyone! Your love and compassion is overwhelming,' he wrote. Since Ms Bellingham's death thousands of pounds has been raised for Action Against Cancer in her memory. Speaking of the public's love for his late wife in the first interview since her death, Michael Pattemore said he was glad she had the chance to experience fans' adoration. ‘She was amazed by the public response, completely overwhelmed, and we were flooded with letters, cards and flowers. Until then, she had no idea how loved she was,' he told the Mail. ‘David Pugh told her: “Lynda, you are lucky. Most people never get to know how much they are loved, but you’ve had a taste of it before you die.” ’","Michael Peluso, 31, said a colonoscopy would have saved mother's life .

"A 26-year-old Polish woman disfigured by a huge tumour has received a new face. The woman, identified only as Joanna, was given the new face during the country's second face transplant. Prior to the operation, she struggled to chew, swallow or talk. A 26-year-old Polish woman, named only as Joanna, has received a new face after she was disfigured by a huge facial tumour (pictured) Joanna had 23-hours of surgery to give her a new face. During the operation, 80 per cent of the skin on her face was replaced . Dr Adam Maciejewski, who led the 23-hour surgery last week, said he hopes the transplant of 80 per cent of the skin on her face will give her back those functions. Joanna was severely deformed by neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along the nerves. The condition can also cause bone problems, pressure on the spinal nerves, severe pain, learning disabilities and vision and hearing problems. There is no cure for it. Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born. Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious. Joanna (pictured during surgery last week) was severely deformed by neurofibromatosis - a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along the nerves . Joanna is currently in serious but . stable condition after the operation at the Cancer Centre and Institute . of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland. The facial tumour will not recur because the skin on her new face is from different genes, genetics expert Dr Anand Saggar told MailOnline. In May, Dr Maciejewski and his . colleagues performed Poland's first face transplant on a man whose face . was torn off by a stone mason's machine. His recovery is said to be . progressing. The man's operation took 27 hours and was carried out just weeks after his accident. It was thought to be the first face transplant to be carried out so soon after the damage had occurred - previous transplants have taken months, or even years, to prepare. Difficult: Before the operation, Joanna struggled to chew, swallow or speak. Following the surgery she can now do all these things again . Joanna is currently in serious but stable condition after the operation at the Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland. Image shows her parents at a press conference . The man had to have his jaw, palate and eye sockets reconstructed. The world's first full-face transplant was carried out on a Spanish farmer in March 2010. Oscar had blown most of his face off with a gun during a hunting accident and was left unable to breathe, swallow or talk properly.","Joanna, 26, struggled to chew, swallow or talk before the operation .

"A brand new Canary island is emerging from the sea as an underwater volcano bubbles to the surface. Magma off the Canary Island of El Hierro has been spewing 20 metres high as the sea boils with a smell of sulphur. As it grows and gets closer to the surface, more and more debris such as stones start to shoot out of the volcano which, until now, has only shown its explosive power below the surface. It is now just 70 metres from the surface and islanders are already trying to come up with a name for the new island. It is quite close to El Hierro and if it continues to erupt it could eventually meet up with the mainland. Scroll down for video . A new island emerges from the sea along the La Restinga's coast off the southern Spanish coast in the Canary Islands . The sea around the volcano is heating up and, at times, has reached as much as 35C . The volcanic activity out at sea has attracted people to the coast, waiting to see the birth of a new island . It's not known at this point whether Ryanair, famed for flying to out-of-town airports, plans on opening up a route to the new-born island. Homes have been evacuated and roads . closed on the southern-most Canary Island following a government-issued . warning about a possible volcanic eruption while shipping has been banned in the area. The southern tip of El Hierro was shaken by a . 4.3-magnitude quake late on Saturday as the underwater volcano just off . the coast started spewing. The island, which has 500 volcanic cones, has already experienced more than 10,000 tremors in the past four months. Renewed fears of an eruption came as vast quantities of magma - the molten rock from just under the earth's crust - began bubbling into the sea off the port of La Restinga. What's your name? Islanders are now debating what to call the new piece of land . Debris was thrown up two 60ft into the air from the area close to the . Canary Islands which has had more than 10,000 tremors in four months . It looks like a new island has been formed, but actually this is just molten rock that is being spewed into the air by the exploding volcano . You may be surprised to learn that 75 per cent of all the lava that erupts every year comes from undersea volcanoes. The surrounding water immediately cools it and a crust forms known as ‘pillow lava’. There are over 5,000 known submarine volcanoes, but some are extremely difficult to find, even with today’s technology. This is because geologists find them by listening for the tell-tale boiling water using hydrophones, but at extreme depths the pressure is too high for water to boil. The Canary Islands are all volcanic in origin, but are not unique in this respect – the Hawaiian islands are also volcanoes that built up over time and breached the surface. In hundreds of thousands of years it’ll get a new island called Lo’ihi, which is slowly forming off the south-east coast. Right now it’s around 3,000 feet beneath the surface, but it’s already been causing trouble, producing frequent earthquakes. Witnesses said that explosive plumes . and jets could be seen on the ocean surface from the underwater volcano . which began erupting last month. Some of the material is being ejected as high as 60ft into the air. The regional government of the Spanish . Canary Island issued a 'yellow' volcanic eruption alert - the . second on a four-level scale. La Restinga's 600 residents were evacuated last week after the volcanic activity began. Now new evacuations have been called for people living along the . southern end of the island. Authorities have also shut down . access to La Restinga. Ships have been ordered away from . waters around the port and aircraft have been banned from flying over . the island's southern tip. The . regional government of the Canary Islands says scientists have detected . airborne volcanic fragments called pyroclasts rising from the sea off . La Restinga. The . government said it awaited scientific reports on the danger posed by . pyroclasts, but a research vessel that was collecting samples there has . been ordered to stop. Fears of an eruption have been going since the end of July, when El Hierro experienced the first of what has become more than 10,000 tremors - collectively known as an earthquake 'swarm'. Residents were evacuated from some areas at the end of September when volcanic activity increased to more than 150 tremors in 24 hours. The army was put on standby for a mass evacuation. Volcano . expert Juan Carlos Carrecedo said at the time: 'There is a ball of magma rising to . the surface producing a series of ruptures which generate seismic . activity. 'We don't know if that ball of magma will break through the crust and cause an eruption.' But he warned an eruption was . possible 'in days, weeks or months'. The last eruption on El Hierro was . in 1793 and lasted for a month while the last one in the Canary Islands . as a whole took place on the island of La Palma in 1971. Threatening: A computer-generated image shows the underground volcano off the southern-most Canary Island .

"As the final NFL draft day arrives all eyes will be on AJ McCarron and Michael Sam to see which team will launch their professional careers. If Sam is called up tonight he will also become the first openly gay football player, after the Missouri linesman announced his sexuality in February. Alabama quarterback McCarron, who thought he would be picked on the first or second draft days, is also waiting for a team to select him. Moment of truth: Missouri All-American defensive Michael Sam is waiting for the call on the last NFL draft day . Waiting game: AJ McCarron kisses Katherine Webb at a game last year. The couple are waiting to hear the quarterback's fate . In all, 20 players are still waiting to be selected as the NFL draft enters its third and final day at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Both McCarron - who is engaged to Splash TV star Katherine Webb - and Sam had not counted on being left in the running on the last day. Sam was expected to go in a middle round, but the 6ft 2in, 255lb linesman has been considered by some teams as too small for a defensive position and not fast enough for an outside linebacker. If he doesn't make the draft, Sam will become a free agent, leaving him free to sign a deal with any team of his choosing. When the 23-year-old revealed he was gay in a series of interviews earlier this year, he said: 'I am an openly, proud gay man ... but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.' He added that he chose to go public so he could 'own my truth before anyone breaks a story about me'. Historic: If Sam, pictured in the 52 jersey, makes the draft he will be the first openly gay NFL player . Focus: All eyes will be on Michael Sam on Saturday to see if the defensive end will get the call . NFL executives and coaches have all backed the football player, promising he will be evaluated on athletic ability alone. 'We admire Michael Sam's honesty and courage. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in the NFL. 'We look forward to welcoming and supporting Michael Sam in 2014,' a spokesman for the NFL said in a statement. However, Chris Kluwe, who used to play for the Minnesota Vikings, said if Sam isn't drafted questions would need to be asked over whether it was because of his sexual orientation. 'Projectable . guys who have to change positions are generally drafted in rounds three . through five,' he told AP. 'A bad combine shouldn't send him out of the . draft. If that's the precedent and that precedent is not met, then why . not?' McCarron has also been anxiously waiting to be selected, after being led to believe he would have been an early pick. Decision time: Members of the forces line the stage as players are selected for the NFL . Anxious: AJ McCarron's mother Dee Dee, left, and girlfriend Katherine Webb, right, will be as nervous as the quarterback during draft day . Updates: Aaron Murray and girlfriend Fox anchor Kacie McDonnell are also waiting to hear his fate . In an interview last month he said NFL executives had said they 'felt like I could go anywhere from 16 to 35. I believe that, too. At the same time, I don’t have my hopes set on anything.' He has watched as other hot tips have been snapped up, including fellow quarterback Johnny Manziel on day one. 'This is the moment I've dreamed about since I was a kid,' Manziel tweeted on Thursday night. 'So honored to be a Cleveland Brown.' Florida's Blake Bortles was another quarterback to go on the first night, when the Jacksonville Jaguars made a play for him. His stunning college student-turned model girlfriend Lindsey Duke was there to cheer him on, tweeting: 'I couldn't be happier' when they found out he had been picked by the Florida team. Another player selected on the first day was Eric Ebron, who was clearly feeling lucky as he proposed to girlfriend Brittany Rountree at the Empire State Building a few hours before getting the call from the Detroit Lions. Early pick: Other quarterbacks, including Johnny Manziel who is pictured after getting selected for the Cleveland Browns, have already had the call . Support: Lindsey Duke says she couldn't be happier after boyfriend Blake Bortles was picked by the Jacksonville Jaguars on day one of the draft . Big day: Eric Ebron proposed to Britanny Rountree at the Empire State Building on Thursday a few hours before he was selected for the Detroit Lions . Sam and McCarron aren't the only high-profile names still left on the list for the final draft day is Aaron Murray, who was slated to be a late pick. The Georgia quarterback, who dates glamorous Fox29  anchor Kacie McDonnell, is considered a good option for a strong back up. He headed to Florida on Friday, as he and McDonnell try to relax before the final team decisions are made tonight. 'We’ll do some bowling, eat and just relax pretty much and see what happens,' he told Dog Bytes. 'We’re . going to ride roller coasters, walk around, have a good time,' he . added, as the quarterback tried to find a suitable distraction from the . tension.","Defensive line Sam announced he was gay as scouting season began .

"Acclaimed eco-chef, and food waste activist Tom Hunt is to host an alternative Christmas Feast at London's Borough Market in December to highlight the problem of food waste during the festive season. The author of The Natural Cook's Feast of Seven Fishes will be created using surplus ingredients that would otherwise have been thrown away for no good reason. This includes wonky vegetables and blemished fruits as well as foraged fresh produce from market traders and fish caught using sustainable fishing methods from recommended healthy stocks. Scroll down for video . Eco chef and food waste activist Tom Hunt will host an alternative Christmas banquet Feast of Seven Fishes on 14 December at Borough Market, London . The banquet, which is a traditional Italian meal usually served on Christmas Eve, will feature dishes like foraged salad of water-celery leaf, chervil and chickweed, and forgotten fish stew of pollock, coley and mussels with chervil. As the chef is sourcing surplus food, the menu is subject to change. 'At Christmas we create a huge amount of unnecessary food waste,' Mr Hunt said. 'With many people hungry at such a festive time I wanted to create an alternative Christmas. 'Let's celebrate this abundance of food by using it to raise money for the people that really need it most'. The banquet -  a traditional Italian meal usually served on Christmas Eve - will feature dishes like foraged salad of water-celery leaf, chervil and chickweed, and forgotten fish stew of pollock, corey and mussels . Both Borough Market and Mr Hunt regularly work with charity projects including FareShare, FoodSave, FoodCycle and StreetSmart to help reduce food waste. As a member of the Slow Food Chef Alliance, Mr Hunt focuses on making sustainable, seasonal and foraged ingredients the focus of his European peasant dish-inspired menus. Borough Market's David Matchett said: 'As part of Borough's ongoing commitment to sustainability we want to prove the value of surplus food by using it to cook a delicious four course Christmas feast. Wonky vegetables and blemished fruits as well as foraged fresh produce and fish caught using sustainable fishing methods from recommended healthy stocks will be used to create the Italian-style four-course meal . 'We want to encourage people to think twice about what they put in the bin and do their bit to reduce food wastage.' The Feast will take place on Sunday 14th December in Borough Market's Three Crown Square. Fifty per cent of profits will be donated to FareShare, the food waste charity.

"Traders at next year's Glastonbury Festival have been banned from selling Native American headdresses following an online petition that got just 65 signatures. Daniel W Round launched a campaign to ban the popular festival accessory on Change.org, arguing that wearing them is 'offensive and disrespectful'. The ban does not stop festival goers from wearing them. Traders have been banned from selling Native American headresses at next year's Glastonbury Festival, as worn above by Shamina Eaton, Rhea Evans and Danielle Wheeler from Bournemouth . The ban only stops traders from selling the item, it doesn't mean festival goers can't wear the accessory . Mr Round said the headdress had become 'increasingly prevalent' over the past few years at Glastonbury and other music festivals, which was a 'concerning trend'. He wrote: 'This summer in particular, I noticed far more festival-goers wearing the headdress as an item of fashion than at previous events - hence this petition. 'There has long been consensus among indigenous civil rights activists in North America about the wearing of headdresses by non-Natives – that it is an offensive and disrespectful form of cultural appropriation, that it homogenises diverse indigenous peoples, and that it perpetuates damaging, archaic and racist stereotypes.' Glastonbury organisers have added the headdress to a list of things traders at the event can not sell without prior consent. Glastonbury organisers added the headdress to a list of things traders at the event can not sell without prior consent, which also includes alcohol, cigarettes, candy flares, flags and gazebos .

"When it comes to picking stocks, he's known as the Oracle of Omaha - able to make his investors billions, but it seems even Warren Buffett can make mistakes when it comes to cherry picking shares. Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway investment group began trading in Tesco shares last autumn with $425 million of stock coupled with an option to buy $125 million more. But the price fell almost instantly, and then kept on falling wiping away hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway investment company  is now nursing losses of about $750 million the shares plunged by as much as 47% this year. It paid $1.7 billion for the stake . Under pressure: Tesco has taken a hit to profits after strong competition from low-cost rivals Aldi and Lidl . Berkshire then sold off about $35 million worth of the stock of Britain's leading supermarket operator to cut its losses, but then repurchased even more shares just as the stock began to take another tumble. His famed investment company was the third biggest shareholder, with a stake of almost 4%. Since last June, his shares in Tesco have lost almost $750 million in value after the shares plunged by as much as 43% this year. It paid $1.7 billion for the stake. A lot of that stake was purchased after the supermarket chain issued a profit warning in January 2012. When others were ditching the stock, Buffet was buying. Mr Buffett has made his fortune taking brave, long-term decisions with his famous quote: 'Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.' Tesco issued a series of profit warnings this year as its sales shrank in the face of intense competition from lower cost rivals.Its top management, including the CEO and finance chief, have been replaced . Short sellers – those who bet shares will fall – have made spectacular returns on Tesco. Tesco has  suspended four executives and called in auditors from Deloitte to conduct an investigation as to how their profits seem to fall wildly below expectations. 'Considering all the problems that Tesco is tackling at the moment ... poor internal accounting issues was the last thing it needed,' said Alastair McCaig, a market analyst at IG in London to CNN Money. 'A downgrade of 23% for its profit forecast is more than a minor issue.' Since the company reported the accounting bungle Monday, its shares have dropped by about 17% to an 11-year low, wiping roughly $5 billion off the firm's market value. Buffett is unlikely to be panicking yet. His guiding principle has always been to find solid companies that will do well over the long-term -- for years, not just a few quarters. The question for investors now is, do Tesco shares look cheap again? Most analysts say they are still to be avoided.","The 'world's savviest investor' has lost money in Tesco .

"People in England are losing more than a million years of life every year due to conditions caused by poor lifestyle, figures show. Up to 50,000 premature deaths annually could be prevented if people were healthier, lived in better housing and had regular check-ups with doctors. If the early deaths are added up, they show that in men a total of two million years were lost between 2009 and 2011 while 1.6 million were lost in women. Bad habits: Many early deaths are caused by cancer, heart disease and diabetes - caused by smoking, alcohol and a bad diet - as well as those from chest infections triggered by poor housing. (Stock image) Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned there is ‘shocking and unnecessary’ variation in premature deaths across the country and pledged to narrow the gap. Figures from the Information Centre for Health and Social Care show that around 50,000 people die an average of 20 years too soon in England every year. They include deaths from cancer, heart disease and diabetes - caused by smoking, alcohol and a bad diet - as well as those from chest infections triggered by poor housing. The data includes a small number of babies who are either stillborn or die in the first weeks of life - often triggered by their mothers smoking or being obese. Disparities: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned there is 'shocking and unnecessary' variation in premature deaths across the country . But there is huge variation across the country with people in Bradford around three times more likely to die early than those in Hampshire. And the inhabitants of Surrey, Sussex and the Home Counties are 1.5 times less likely to die prematurely than those living in Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside. Public health experts also pointed out that poor housing with inadequate heating and damp conditions was leading to the deaths of thousands of the elderly. Jeremy Hunt said: ‘There is a shocking variation in early and unnecessary deaths across the country which I am determined to start putting right as part of my ambition to save 30,000 lives a year by 2020. ‘Local authorities have been given the power and budget to tackle the needs of their local population.’ But Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said major social changes were needed to reduce the death roll. He said: ‘We hear all the rhetoric of localism but this country continues to be one of the most centralised countries in Europe. Are they really going to return power to the local level so they can do something? ‘It ought to be a matter of profound embarrassment to us that we’ve got children who aren’t fed properly, aren’t clothed properly. ‘We’ve got two, three, four generations who haven’t had access to work. There are very low aspirations. Parents don’t want their children to go away in search of jobs. We want children to be able to aspire.” ‘People living in older private rented housing, they don’t have modern heating, pensions only allow them to keep one room warm and they go up to bed in a cold bedroom.’ Matthew Fagg, deputy director for reducing premature mortality at NHS England - the new body in charge of running the health service - said: ‘These variations should never be deemed acceptable and NHS England is committed to addressing them.’","Health Secretary warns of ‘shocking’ variation in premature deaths in UK .

"A picturesque tourist destination on Catalonia’s Costa Brava is cracking down on rowdy stag and hen parties that disturb locals and other visitors. The seafront town of Tossa de Mar is so fed up with drunken and scantily-clad tourists from Britain and other countries that it has banned stag and hen dos during the month of August and placed them under strict regulations throughout the rest of the year. Local authorities say the new rules are aimed at party planners – not individual groups of visitors – who organise booze cruises, treasure hunts and other events for tourists’ stag and hen dos. Residents of Tossa de Mar have had enough of rowdy stag and hen parties (file photo) The town is taking action after locals complained about drunken partygoers urinating in the street and singing loudly in the town’s squares in the early morning hours. Mayor Gisela Saladich Pares told the Guardian: ‘They come here and do whatever they want. It can’t be like that.’ To deter raucous behaviour, party planners must apply for annual permits and give police a detailed itinerary for each event they host in the town on the Mediterranean Sea. The picturesque seafront town has banned stag and hen dos during the month of August . Party planners are now required to obtain permits and share their itineraries with local police . Planners risk being fined or shut down by police if they don’t follow the rules and visitors could be slapped with fines of up to £480 if they are too loud in public places. Located 60 miles north of Barcelona in north-eastern Spain, Tossa de Mar lures holidaymakers with its sandy beaches, blue waters and a hilltop castle. Its mayor said the restrictions are meant to give locals some peace and quiet, not to spoil tourists’ fun. She said: ‘They can be on a boat having the party of their life, that’s fine, but when they get off the boat they should walk calmly to the restaurant or hotel.’ Tossa de Mar's mayor says the new rules are not meant to spoil the tourists' fun . Spain is one of the most popular destinations for Britons looking to let loose, but it appears they have worn out their welcome as a handful of communities have taken action or held protests calling for a crackdown on rowdy behaviour. On the outskirts of Barcelona, the picturesque fishing village of Barceloneta has become a popular stop for young tourists thanks to its all-night raves. Last August, furious locals held protests at blocks of flats rented to holidaymakers, with chants of ‘out, out, out drunken tourists’. The protests were organised after a photo posted online showed three naked Italian tourists running out of a supermarket.","Tossa de Mar has placed the parties under strict rules that exist year-round .

"A blogger who writes about Aboriginal affairs has revealed how she was forced to ask a white friend to rent the house she lives in because she was deemed 'too dark' to be accepted for a lease. Kelly Briggs, who blogs for news websites such as Crikey and The Guardian, tried to rent a property for herself in her hometown of Moree, a rural town in north-western NSW, for six months. The mother of two, who has over 8,000 followers on Twitter, told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'Racism in Moree is so entrenched that people don't see it.' Scroll down for video . Kelly Briggs has revealed she was forced to ask a white friend to rent the house she lives in because no one would let her rent a home for six months . Ms Briggs, who writes about politics and black feminism, said her friends in the Aboriginal community have experienced the same problem when it comes to finding housing. Despite having a diploma in business governance, the 34-year-old has also been unable to find a job for two years. On her personal website, The Koori Woman, she previously revealed how when she visited a chemists in Sydney she was trailed constantly by a security guard and wrongly accused of shoplifting. 'The security guard did not apologise, he didn’t even look at me when he said, I’m just doing my job... No one apologised for embarrassing me, making me feel like a criminal or for falsely insinuating that I had stolen from them,' she wrote. 'It doesn’t matter how old I become, I will never be accorded the respect of the benefit of the doubt when I walk into a store, I will always be singled out, followed and have my bag searched.' Kelly Briggs blogs for news websites such as Crikey and The Guardian but has been unemployed for two years . Ms Briggs lives with her two children in the town of Moreee (picured here) Ms Briggs has started a fundraising campaign so that she can earn a salary from her popular blogs and spoke out about her own housing struggle after the release of the government's Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage report. It was announced on Wednesday that the federal government won't set a closing-the-gap justice target despite the report showing indigenous incarceration rates are on the rise. The latest Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage report found adult imprisonment rates more than doubled between 2000 and 2013. Indigenous youths are 24 times more likely to go to prison than non-indigenous young people. The Australian Greens and Labor are calling for the government to set a justice target, claiming the new statistics show the gap can no longer be ignored. Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion confirmed on Wednesday the government would not set target, a decision he says was not taken lightly. 'We need action rather than targets,' he said, adding the key was getting children into school and adults into work. Ms Briggs tried to rent a property for herself in her hometown of Moree, a rural town in north-western NSW . The 34-year-old writes about Indigenous affairs and black politics on her own blog . Labor described the decision as a 'complete backflip' from a previously bipartisan approach, accusing the government of doing nothing in the past year about a justice target. 'Their attitude can be categorised as ignorance, idleness and inactivity,' opposition indigenous affairs spokesman Shane Neumann told AAP. The Productivity Commission report, released on Wednesday, also found the number of indigenous Australians admitted to hospital for self harm nearly doubled between 2004 and 2012. They are nearly three times more likely to be hospitalised for self harm than non-indigenous people. The same disparity is reported for levels of high or very high psychological distress. Mr Neumann said areas highlighted by the report, including preventative health, matched those subject to budget cuts. 'The government's got its eye right off the ball,' he said. The latest Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage report found adult imprisonment rates more than doubled between 2000 and 2013 . The government is determining which programs will be funded under its indigenous advancement strategy, but insists effective frontline services won't be touched. 'Throwing money at this problem continually is not going solve it,' Senator Scullion said. Labor claims the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and Family Violence Protection Legal Services have been gutted. Indigenous Labor senator Nova Peris said the report was alarming but not surprising and urged government action to address the failures. The report found progress was being made in several areas, including child mortality rates, life expectancy, Year 12 attainment and employment. Two-thirds of indigenous people were employed in full time work between 2011-2013, up from 54.6 per cent in 2002. However, there has been no improvement in basic reading, writing and numeracy rates for school children or family violence. There were positive changes when it came to adult employment and mortality rates but no change when it came to literacy, domestic violence.

"These incredible photographs show a huge tank graveyard in the Ukraine - home to hundreds of the abandoned vehicles which the country may desperately need if tensions with Russia continue to escalate. Filled with rows upon rows of slowly rusting relics, the once deadly war machines now lie dormant in a secret depot in the city of Kharkiv in the Slobozhanshchyna region of eastern Ukraine - just 20 miles from the border with Russia. Despite it being heavily guarded, photographer Pavel Itkin, 18, was able to sneak into the plant and spent several hours taking photographs.

Abandoned: Despite the disused area being monitored by guards, Mr Itkin managed to sneak in and take several photographs of the neglected storage centre. Here dozens of old tank engines and other bits of machinery sit rotting on the factory floor . After hearing about the strange Soviet-era tank cemetery from a friend, photographer Patvel Itkin, 18, spent months trying find its whereabouts. Despite the area being heavily monitored by guards, Mr Itkin managed to sneak in and spent several hours taking dozens of photographs. Once a thriving tank repair plant, work at the depot wound down after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, with many of the vehicles on site abandoned. The plant once specialised in the overhaul and modernisation of T-64, T-72, and T-80 tanks built at the nearby Malyshev Factory in Kharkiv. The T-64 is a Soviet-era main battle tank first built in the early 1960s. The T-72 was introduced in the 1970s and went on to become one of the most widely produced tanks of the late 20th Century. The T-80 entered service alongside the T-72 in 1976 and was the first production tank to be equipped with a gas turbine engine for main propulsion. The tank is still used by Ukraine today, with variants adopted by Russia, Belarus, Cyprus, Kazakhstan, Pakistan and South Korea. Desolate: Once a thriving tank repair plant, the depot has since become redundant, meaning the once-deadly vehicles are now abandoned . Photographer Pavel Itkin said: 'It took me many months to track down this place, I had heard about it from a friend and decided it would be a great place to take pictures' Luck: The area around the plant is heavily guarded but Mr Itkin says he didn't see anyone when he got there. He thinks he was 'just lucky' not to be seen . Mr Itkin said 'It took me many months to track down this place, I had heard about it from a friend and decided it would be a great place to take pictures.' Describing the hours he spent on the site, he added: 'The area is guarded but I there didn't seem to be anyone around when I got there, I guess I was just lucky.' 'Once I got inside I was walking around the grounds for about two hours, the plant is stunning, I was amazed by the scale... Just imagine over 400 tanks in one place, row after row of them.' During its prime in the 1960s and 70s, the Kharkiv plant repaired more than 60 tanks and 55 engines per month. Following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, however, many of the tanks on the site were left to rot as the newly independent Ukraine didn't have the money or desire to fix or modernise old machines. Despite production winding down in the 1990s, the plant never officially closed and a handful of mechanics remain on site doing occasional work repairing modern tanks. On Saturday, dozens of people were injured in Kharkiv when pro-Russian protesters, some brandishing axe handles and chains, stormed the city hall. The Russian flag was hoisted onto the building but by Sunday morning the crowd had left and local authorities were back in control .

"A new £2 coin launched to commemorate the start of the First World War has been criticised for being too jingoisitc and glorifying war, after the Royal Mint chose a design featuring an army recruitment poster. Former War Minister Lord Kitchener is shown on the coin in military uniform pointing towards the viewer and saying 'Your country needs YOU' - an image which symbolised the early optimism of the war, which would claim almost a million British lives. But while the Mint described the image as 'powerful' and 'instantly recognisable', sceptical users took to social media to accuse them of attempting a 'rebrand' of the conflict. Scroll down for video . Minted: The image was chosen to appear on a commemorative £2 coin earlier this year . Predicting 'wall-to-wall jingoism', users said the Mint made a 'shameful' decision to glorify a military leader, rather than honouring the loss of rank-and-file soldiers. The coin is being produced by the Royal Mint as part of a collection designed specifically for events in 2014. The former War Minister, who is also associated with the use of concentration camps in the Boer war, has proved a controversial decision with those who view the image of a red poppy as a more fitting tribute to the conflict. Military figure: It has been suggested that Lord Kitchener, shown here in full military uniform, was an inappropriate choice . Twitter user Andrew Reid wrote: 'Just . saw the Kitchener £2 coin. The official rebrand of WWI is apparently . underway. It's going to be wall-to-wall jingoism, isn't it?', while Adam . Murray said: 'That's not a sombre symbol of WW1 Remembrance. Should be a . poppy or a soldier.' Trevor Warner added: 'Shameful that the . Royal Mint are issuing a £2 coin in 2014 with a portrait of Lord . Kitchener, the man who gave the world concentration camps.' Another said: 'New £2 coin glorifies ad campaign that led young men to needless death.' Almost 2.5million men volunteered for Lord Kitchener's 'New Army' after a recruitment drive in 1914 and 1915 featuring the posters. But once the harsh realities of life on the front lines became clear, many of the young men who had volunteered for service felt betrayed by patriotic materials glorifying war to encourage them to sign up. Kevin Clancy, director of the Royal Mint . Museum, said the Kitchener coin would be the first in a series that will . follow the progress of the First World War, amid centenary events over . the next five years. He added: ‘It’s got a very familiar design, . Lord Kitchener pointing out from the face of the coin, as he did from . the contemporary posters, asking people at the time to sign up for the . Army.’ The Royal Mint has been criticised for its choice of image, which it described as 'powerful' and 'instantly recognisable'. Imitative: The redesigned coin (left) features the mustachioed face of First World War recruitment (right) Indeed, a page on the Royal Mint's website, offering the coin, along with an information pack, for £10 suggests it could be used to 'honour someone in your family who played their part' in the war. It explained: 'In 1914 Lord Kitchener was appointed to mastermind a recruitment campaign that would go on to create one of the largest volunteer armies ever known in Britain. 'Though many posters encouraged the men of Britain to enlist, the image of Kitchener himself has come to stand for the call to fight for King and country that saw men respond in their thousands. 'Perhaps you wish to honour someone in your family who played their part, or pay your respects as the nation remembers. Maybe you have an interest in military history or want to learn more about such a significant time. You will want to secure one of these Brilliant Uncirculated £2 coins.' The Royal Mint said that the image of Kitchener 'has come to stand for the call to fight for King and country', which is why it was judged worthy of its 'national theme' by an advisory committee. A statement said: 'The Royal Mint is one of the world’s oldest and most venerable organisations, with an unbroken history of minting British coinage dating back over 1000 years. '[The coin] was selected to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War because it has come to be so strongly associated with the outbreak of the war. 'Though many posters encouraged the men of Britain to enlist, the image of Kitchener himself has come to stand for the call to fight for King and country that saw men respond in their thousands. 'The launch of every new coin must go through a rigorous planning and design selection process governed by an independent panel, known as The Royal Mint Advisory Committee (RMAC). 'The RMAC is an advisory non-departmental public body of HM Treasury comprising history, art and design specialists, and is responsible for ensuring that the coin that reaches the public meets the highest standards of quality and artistic merit, and is worthy of its national theme.' Paying tribute: Another redesigned £2 coin pays tribute to the 500th anniversary of Trinity House, the coastal defences that have protected Britain's waters since 1514. The back of the coin features the Queen's portrait . New designs: A 50p marking the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow next year will also enter circulation in 2014 . As well as the Kitchener design, the . Mint unveiled five new designs for several denomination of coins, . including £2, £1, 50p and a special edition £5 coin. 100th Anniversary of First World War (£2) This coin is part of a five-year commemoration of the First World War. It bears sculptor John Bergdahl’s powerful likeness of the instantly recognisable call to arms by Lord Kitchener. 500th Anniversary of Trinity House (£2) Designed by Joe Whitlock-Blundell and David Eccles, this coin features an image of a lighthouse lens - the enduring symbol of safety on the seas. It pays tribute to the lighthouses and pilot ships of Trinity House, who have safeguarded Britain's waters for more than 500 years. British Isles floral emblems (£1) Last year saw the start of a £1 coin series celebrating the floral emblems of the British Isles. These two new designs by Timothy Noad feature a thistle and bluebell for Scotland and a flax plant and shamrock for Northern Ireland.  Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games (50p) Designed by Alex Loudon and Dan Flashman, this sport features two of the most iconic Commonwealth sports – athletics and cycling – in addition to the Saltire of Scotland and lettering inspired by Charles Rennie Mackintosh . Among these is another £2 coin which pays tribute to the 500th anniversary of Trinity House. The organisation, which runs the UK’s lighthouses, was set up during the reign of Henry VIII, in 1514. The . other is the instantly recognisable call to arms by Lord Kitchener - . commemorating the start of World War One on July 28, 1914. Two new floral designs for £1 coins - . featuring a thistle and bluebell for Scotland and a flax plant and . shamrock for Northern Ireland - will also enter circulation in 2014. They will join a rose design for England and a daffodil for Wales that are already used and exchanged in the UK on a daily basis. A 50 pence piece commemorating the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow next year will also be launched - with a special edition £5 coin completing the Royal Mint's new collection. Created by sculptor Mark Richards, the £5 piece marks the 300th anniversary of the death of Queen Anne. The back of each coin will continue to carry the current portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Ian Rank-Broadley FRBS. The new designs are expected to be sought after in a similar way to the 29 different London 2012 Olympic Games 50 pence coins, which quickly became the Royal Mint's most collected coin. Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coin at the Royal Mint, said: 'The Royal Mint has celebrated moments of national and cultural significance for over 1,000 years. 'The designs that go onto our country’s coins for 2014 will represent this sparking intrigue and interest in the story each one tells. Emblems: Floral designs for Northern Ireland and Scotland, created by Timothy Noad, have also been launched . Tradition: The typical purse-filling coins of 1p to £1 will continue to carry sections of the royal coat of arms . 'With this in mind we wanted to reveal the coins to the British public and show the incredible works of art they can expect to see enter circulation this year. 'This will no doubt entice many to take a closer look at their change, collect their favourites and realise that many might be worth holding on to.' The typical purse-filling coins of 1p to £1 will continue to carry sections of the royal coat of arms that can be arranged to complete the famous emblem.","New coin commemorating First World War will enter circulation in 2014 .

"Baby stroller company Graco has recalled close to five million pushchairs due to the risk of fingertip amputation at the hinges. The recall was officially announced on Thursday by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) after Graco received reports of 11 injuries to children including six fingertip amputations, four partial amputations and one laceration. The danger, found in 11 models of stroller manufactured in China, was the folding hinge on the sides which can pinch a child’s finger. The Breeze Model Stroller made by Graco (pictured). It is one of 11 models of baby stroller being recalled after company received reports of 11 injuries to children including six fingertip amputations . The stroller models being recalled were made between August 2000 and September 2014 and named Aspen, Breeze, Capri, Cirrus, Glider, Kite, LiteRider, Sierra, Solara, Sterling and TravelMate Model Strollers and Travel Systems. Along with the 4.7 million strollers being recalled in the U.S., around 200,000 in Canada and 10,300 in Mexico are also potentially affected. According to the CPSC, stroller owners were asked to contact Graco for a free repair kit which will be available from the start of December. Until that time, 'caregivers should exercise extreme care when unfolding the stroller to be certain that the hinges are firmly locked before placing a child in the stroller', the government body advised. A close-up of the faulty Graco stroller hinge which has caused 5 million models to be recalled by the company on Thursday . If a stroller begins to fold, the child should be taken out of the stroller immediately, according to the CPSC statement. According to ABC, owners are expected to fix the stroller hinges by themselves as it is 'very easy to install'. MailOnline was awaiting a response from Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday. The full list of strollers being recalled can be found here. Graco, based in Atlanta, Georgia, makes a wide range of baby products including car seats, high chairs and swings. The Kite Model Stroller (left) and the Literider Model Stroller (right) are among the 11 models which are part of the recall . In July, Graco was caught in another dispute and forced to recall 1.9 million infant car seats, bowing to demands from U.S. safety regulators. The recall, the largest for car seats in American history, came after a five-month spat between Graco and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Earlier this year the company recalled 4.2 million toddler seats because the harness buckles can get stuck. But it resisted the agency's demand to recall the infant seats. Buckles can get gummed up by food and drinks, and that could make it hard to remove children. In some cases parents had to cut harnesses to get their kids out. The agency said that increases the risk of injuries in emergencies.","The Atlanta-based company on Thursday recalled 11 models of stroller which have been made in China since 2000 .

"Video footage has emerged which shows the moment seven of President Bashar al-Assad's Syrian soldiers are executed on camera by rebels fighting to overthrow the regime. The soldiers are stripped, bound and pushed to the ground where a number of rebels stand over them pointing guns at their bodies. Some bear vicious injuries on their backs and arms. Just before they are killed, the ring-leader Abdul Samad Issa - known as 'The Uncle', recites a poem before he fires the first bullet. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Horrific: The soldiers are stripped, bound and pushed to the ground where a number of rebels stand over them pointing guns at their bodies before they are shot . 'For fifty years, they are companions to corruption', he says. 'We swear to the Lord of the Throne, that this is our oath: We will take revenge.' The . horrific scene filmed in April 2012 was documented in a video smuggled out . of Syria only a few days ago by a former rebel who says he had become . horrified by the brutality of the tactics his one-time comrades are . using. He gave the footage to The New York Times. It . has emerged as G20 leaders meet in Russia to debate the dire situation . in the war-torn country and will add fuel to the view that the rest of . the world cannot actively support rebels who are carrying out atrocities . equally as brutal as the troops deployed by President Assad. Issa is known as 'the uncle' because two of his deputies are his nephews. His former aide, who had the copy of the footage, said the captured soldiers' allegedly had videos of them raping Syrian civilians and looting which led to the execution. Issa requested the execution be filmed so he could show it to donors to help secure more funding. At the end of the footage, the bodies of the soldiers are dumped in a well while one of the gunmen looks into the camera and smiles. Brutal: The bodies of the soldiers are dumped in a well after they are shot dead by the rebels . It is believed Issa has the support of around 300 fighters willing to carry out the executions of captured soldiers. The 37-year-old, a trader and livestock herder before the war, formed the group at the start of the uprising using his own money to buy weapons and pay for his own soldiers' expenses. His father was opposed to President Hafez al-Assad, the father of Syria’s current president, but in 1982, he disappeared. Issa believes he was killed during a 27-day government crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood which sparked his hatred of the government. The video has emerged as G20 leaders meet in Russia to debate the situation in Syria . Last year, it is believed he was running a training camp in Turkey and gathering weapons, according to the New York Times. The footage will no doubt cause problems for the U.S. which is considering attacking Syrian forces over its alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians. Yesterday, Secretary of State John Kerry spoke of the issue of radicalised rebels which he said made up 15 to 20 per cent of the opposition.

"Two brothers have died within less than a year of each other, leaving their parents devastated. David Butler, a serving soldier, died on November 24 last year following a two-year battle with cancer. His younger brother Rob was found dead earlier this month - just days before his 28th birthday and weeks before the brothers' parents Mel, 68, a retired engineer and Anne, 60, prepared to mark the first anniversary of David's death at their home in Sittingbourne in Kent.

David Butler died in his early 30s and had spent 14 years with the Royal Signals, completing two tours of Afghanistan. He had also recently married. Henry Durban-Haskins a friend of the family said: 'Rob coped as best as he could when Dave died. They were very close and he found it very tough. 'When Rob died there were no signs, no warnings. Rob was unbelievably fit - he was well-known for it. 'And then there's the timing - almost a year on from Dave passing away - as the family were thinking about that. 'They had had an enormous amount to cope with over the last year. 'So this happening at this time is just tragic. The odds are unbelievable. We're struggling to get our heads around it all.

"A new study conducted in Victoria could change the practices of ambulance services across Australia and even across the world. The incredible research has found that giving oxygen to a heart attack patient could actually cause them harm and could entice more heart attacks. The landmark study, which followed more than 400 patients treated by Ambulance Victoria's Mobile Intensive care ambulance paramedics, said providing oxygen offers no benefit at all and instead could cause further damage to the heart muscle. The new study has found that giving oxygen to heart attack patients could cause harm and entice more heart attacks . The landmark study followed more than 400 patients treated by Ambulance Victoria's who had chest pain and evidence that they had sudden blockage to one of the heart arteries . Those who took part in the study had chest pain and evidence that they had sudden blockage to one of the heart arteries, with half treated with oxygen and the other without. ‘For more than 100 years, it has been routine practice across the world to give oxygen to people having a heart attack because it was thought this would be beneficial,’ said the principal investigators, Dr Karen Smith from Ambulance Victoria and Professor Stephen Bernard from The Alfred. ‘More recently there have been questions about whether oxygen really helps, and uncertainty about what is the best treatment for patients.’ ‘Our data suggests that routine oxygen supplementation could cause greater harm for patients having a heart attack,' they said. 'The study found increased heart damage on MRI scans at six months.’ While some hospitals and ambulance services, including Ambulance Victoria, have modified practices, it is still very common to give patients oxygen both in Australia and across the globe. The landmark study also found that those patients who were receiving oxygen could be more likely to have further heart attacks . The study findings are likely to change practices for ambulance services across Australia and even across the world . The surprising results from the study have just been released at one of the world’s leading medical conferences, the annual American Heart Association conference in Chicago. Alarmingly it also showed those who were receiving oxygen could be more likely to have further heart attacks. Co-researcher and Ambulance Victoria Paramedic Ziad Nehme said there were several reasons for oxygen causing additional damage. ‘High-flow oxygen has been shown to narrow coronary arteries and reduce the heart’s blood flow, as well as accelerate the production of harmful reactive oxygen molecules which increase heart inflammation and stress,' he said. ‘This study is likely to change the practice of ambulance services in Australia and around the world, and is another example of Ambulance Victoria’s research changing global practice to improve patient outcomes.' But Mr Nehme said providing oxygen was still appropriate for patients with low levels of oxygen in their blood. ‘These patients do need supplemental oxygen and were excluded from the trial.'","New landmark study discovers giving oxygen to a heart attack patient can cause harm .

The app called ‘Plastic Surgery & Plastic Doctor & Plastic Hospital Office for Barbie version’ was released earlier this month by the developers Corina Game. It is marketed at users aged nine and above due to ‘infrequent/ mild realistic violence’. The Twitter campaign criticised another plastic surgery app on Google Play that can be used by players of all ages. The game’s description reads: ‘Barbara likes to eat a lot of burgers and chocolates and once she found that she looks ugly. ‘She can’t make it up with situation any additional second. And today plastic surgeon is going to make operation on her body and face in order to return cute Barbara’s look. She is afraid of all of this.’ This plastic surgery app is estimated to have been installed between 500,000 and 1 million times. A Google spokesman said: ‘We don’t comment on individual apps, but will remove apps that breach our guidelines.’ However, Google removed also removed the app yesterday. A Girl Guide’s survey on young women’s body issues and self-esteem found that 87 per cent of girls aged 11-21 think women are judged more on their appearance than on their ability. And 60 per cent of 11-21 year olds said they have had comments about their appearance shouted at them at school, or have been shouted or whistled at in the street.","App instructs children to perform plastic surgery on the image of a woman .

Experts . shown the video by German newspaper Bild said it was clearly a parasite . that had been eating the praying mantis alive from the inside. It . would have eventually been killed when the worm was ready to escape. They said it appeared to be a horsehair worm or Nematomorpha. The praying mantis is a protected insect in Germany where it is extremely rare but it is not clear where the video was shot. The praying mantis is a protected insect in Germany where it is extremely rare but it is not clear where the video was shot . It has been described as a real-life enactment of the famous scene from Alien when a man sprayed the praying mantis with pesticide, killing it instantly, only to see seconds later a huge worm bursting out of the body of the dead insect . The video was posted last May but only went viral this week. The experts said that nematomorph hairworms do not just colonise the belly of their hosts, they eat them alive causing erratic behaviour that can make the insects to fall into water - perfect for the parasite as they need water to reproduce. In 2002, researchers investigated anecdotal reports of insects infected with the parasite 'committing suicide' by jumping into water. The researchers compared the behaviour of crickets infected with the worm against uninfected crickets, and found the infected ones were more likely to jump into the water. Water is fatal for the crickets, but the parasite relies on the water to reproduce. The worms can grow to two metres long, and the adults live freely in water, but the larvae are parasitic on various insects and crustaceans. Some of viewers on You Tube expressed doubts about the authenticity of the video, but Professor Christopher Darling from the University of Toronto said it's a fairly common phenomenon. He said: 'I am pretty sure that this is real, and not a hoax. I have seen and photographed similar things a number of times.' Darling, who is also a senior curator of entomology at the Royal Ontario Museum, said the worm was likely tightly packed inside the abdomen of the insect until the insect died. 'And yes, they do look very long, but they are very skinny,' he wrote.","German video shows a man spraying a praying mantis with pesticide .

'The man surrendered without incident around 11.30am and was returned to custody. 'Police will now assess a device that was located on the man.' The man allegedly had an 'Irish Republican Army flag' strapped to his body, according to Nine News. Earlier, a Victoria Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Police are currently in negotiations with a man at a corrections centre in Lara. 'Emergency services were called to the facility just before 9.30am and a number of specialists are en route to the scene.' The prison is located 6 kilometres  from the township of Lara. Corrections Victoria spokesman Michael Newhouse told the Herald Sun: 'There is no immediate threat to staff or other prisoners, and no evacuations are required at this stage.' The prison is home to some of the state's most notorious underworld figures, bikies and violent offenders . In July, the prison, which is home to some of the state's most notorious underworld figures, bikies and violent offenders, was in lockdown after a small explosion, believed to have been triggered by a parcel bomb. The explosion occurred in an unoccupied cell at Barwon Prison near Geelong and a second bomb is believed to have been discovered before it detonated. The jail was locked down an hour earlier than usual for the day, while emergency authorities were on site. Barwon Prison was where Melbourne gangland boss Carl Williams was bashed to death by Matthew Johnson in the high-security Acacia section of the prison in 2010.

"A grandmother of five made more than 5,000 jars of marmalade to raise £10,000 to help poor people all over the Third World. For the last 16 year, Gloria Irons has been giving away jars of her home-made fruit spread in return for donations to the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD). The 70-year-old said her marmalade has even been taken to far-flung African countries such as Rwanda and Ethiopia for the locals to enjoy. Gloria Irons from Norwich has been giving away her jars of homemade marmalade in return for donations to the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) 'I just love doing it and I'll continue as long as I can,' said Mrs Irons, of Norwich. Even breaking her wrist did not stop the retired carer, as she roped in her supportive husband Colin and supervised the marmalade making. 'I can make 24 jars in two hours now, including washing and sterilising the jars. 'It got a bit tricky when I broke my wrist but Colin helped me out. 'It all started by accident. I was going to a fete and I had forgotten to bake anything. 'I grabbed some jars of marmalade I had made and they sold like hot cakes.' Her closely-guarded recipe for the orange variety proved an instant hit and began selling as quickly as she could make it. A CAFOD worker took one jar to Rwanda, where Mrs Iron's group of churches, St George's, Our Lady Mother of God, and St Boniface Church, were supporting a community in Musha. 'I only gave it to her as a joke to take - I didn't expect her to. It was lovely to see the people with my marmalade in photos.' Made with love: Mrs Irons says she wants to help those less fortunate than her . Although the recipe changes slightly for Christmas punters, with some additional whisky in tinsel-decorated jars, there is another crucial ingredient. 'I just put love into it. 'Through CAFOD, I have learnt a lot about the poverty in other countries. 'I want to help those less fortunate. 'They have so little and we have so much. 'We've raised money for different appeals over the years. 'One that sticks in my mind was the horrendous floods in Mozambique. We heard about a community who lived close to the river banks. 'Their homes were completely washed away. 'After the floods, CAFOD helped the community to build new homes, higher up the hills away from the river. 'I can remember this old boy sitting in his new tin hut; the icing on the cake for him was that he now had a tin roof. 'He said he felt like a king - and all he needed now was a wife.

"Black Pete, the jolly sidekick of the Dutch Saint Nicholas, is finally getting a facelift after years of bitter debate including death threats against those calling for change. An Amsterdam court's ruling in July that Pete - traditionally dressed in a gaudy medieval costume with a blackened face, red lips and an afro wig - is a 'negative stereotype' encouraged many to try to change the deeply rooted custom. 'It's the beginning of change, it will continue for years to come because more and more people agree it should change but it's going to take a long time,' said historian Gabor Kozijn, author of a study on Black Pete for the Dutch Centre for Intangible Cultural Heritage. Black Pete, the jolly sidekick of the Dutch Saint Nicholas, is finally getting a facelift after years of bitter debate including death threats against those calling for change . With less than two months before Dutch kids' favourite day, December 5, when Saint Nicholas and Pete hand out presents, the debate has reached fever pitch, with Black Pete's defenders refusing to admit there is anything racist about the playful character. In Gouda, where Saint Nicholas and dozens of Petes will 'arrive' on November 15 with a gift-filled boat from Spain in a national event broadcast live on television, the mayor on Tuesday decided to introduce some new colours. Besides a number of Black Petes, there will also be 'Cheese Petes' with yellow faces and 'Stroopwafel Petes' with striped, light brown faces resembling the traditional Dutch syrup biscuit of the same name. 'There is no simple way to find a solution that everyone can identify with,' said Gouda Mayor Milo Schoenmaker. Gouda's Black Petes 'changed several years ago to dark brown without stereotypical big red lips and earrings,' the city hall added. An Amsterdam court's ruling in July that Pete - traditionally dressed in a gaudy medieval costume with a blackened face, red lips and an afro wig - is a 'negative stereotype' encouraged many to try to change the deeply rooted custom . Saint Nicholas, or Sinterklaas, center with white beard, and his black helpers, Black Petes, wave to children and grown-ups, as they arrive by boat at Amsterdam's Central Station . Amsterdam Mayor Eberhard van der Laan has said that a 'substantial' number of this year's Petes will not be black but will have some 'soot marks' on their faces, ostensibly from climbing down the chimney. And a White Pete will for the first time be present during a daily televised 'news bulletin' on Saint Nicholas's activities. Dutch shops will have fewer Black Petes this year, although discount retail chain Hema in August denied rumours that it planned to remove him entirely by next year. Customers at supermarket Albert Heijn will have different coloured Petes to choose from, including black: 'Saint Nicholas is for everyone,' the chain said in a statement. Despite compromising on Black Pete, the two chains are being threatened with boycotts. Many people in The Netherlands do not want to see the national tradition changed because what they consider a minority of people see it as racist. Last year's debate about Pete's skin colour was particularly heated amid a UN rights probe of the matter. The UN working group released its findings in July, concluding that Black Pete is indeed a racist figure and that many Dutch did not recognise him as a throwback to colonial times and slavery. This year, Dutch celebrities who called on Facebook for a 'Pete makeover' have received death threats. After investigative journalist Peter R. de Vries entered the debate on Facebook he received an email saying: 'If I meet you you'll get a bullet through your head.' A 'Pietitie' (Pete-ition) on Facebook calling for action against changing Black Pete's face has more than two million likes, in a country of 17 million. Populist Geert Wilders, who heads the anti-immigration PVV party, tweeted: 'Black Pete must stay black!' 'What children want is presents. Whether the person who hands them out is Black or White Pete, a woman, yellow or bald is of no importance,' actor and presenter Paul de Leeuw said on Facebook. 'It's a popular family event, celebrated by millions of people who want their kids to experience what they experienced as children: it's more of an emotional than a rational debate,' historian Kozijn told AFP. Even if it is the beginning of the end for Black Pete, Kozijn said the character will be around for a while yet. 'If the average life expectancy of children who now know Black Pete is 80, then he will in any case remain a figure that people know,' he said.","Black Pete is a jolly, but controversial, sidekick of the Dutch Saint Nicholas .

"Struggling to get the kids to eat their five-a-day? Scientists may well have invented a novel solution that will certainly provide a small boost to their intake - chocolate made with fruit juice. And it is better for their waistline too, as the tiny droplets of juice - apple, orange and cranberry - are used to replace up to half of the bar's fat content. The technique works with all types of chocolate, dark, milk, and white, but does give the final product a fruity flavour, the researchers have admitted. Fruity flavour: Scientists have developed chocolate bars with half the fat that count as one of your five a day - because they have fruit juice droplets . But there is the option to use a mixture of water and vitamin C instead of fruit juice in a bid to maintain a more chocolatey taste. The technique, developed by a team at the University of Warwick, substitute the cocoa butter and milk fats that go into conventional bars with liquid in the form of micro-bubbles. This helps the chocolate retain a velvety 'mouth-feel' - firm and snappy to the bite and yet melt in the mouth. Speaking about the technique at national meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans, lead researcher Dr Stefan Bon said: 'We have established the chemistry that's a starting point for healthier chocolate confectionary. 'This approach maintains the things that make chocolate ""chocolatey"", but with fruit juice instead of fat. Now we're hoping the food industry will take the next steps and use the technology to make tasty, lower-fat chocolate bars and other candy.' He added: 'Everyone loves chocolate - but unfortunately we all know that many chocolate bars are high in fat. 'However it's the fat that gives chocolate all the indulgent sensations that people crave - the silky smooth texture and the way it melts in the mouth but still has a ""snap"" to it when you break it with your hand.' The process also prevents the unappetizing white film that coats the surface of chocolate that has been on the shelf for a while. A two-ounce (57g) serving of premium dark chocolate may contain up to 13g of fat, around 20 per cent of the an individual's daily fat intake, with much being the unhealthier saturated variety. But although high in fat and sugar, chocolate does have high levels of healthful plant-based substances known as antioxidants or flavonoids. And substituting fruit juice could also reduce the overall sugar content of the confectionary. The team used fruit juices and other food-approved ingredients to form a Pickering emulsion - a method which prevents the small droplets from merging with each other. Dr Bon said: 'Since the juice is spread out in the chocolate, it doesn't overpower the taste of the chocolate. We believe that the technology adds an interesting twist to the range of chocolate confectionary products available. 'The opportunity to replace part of the fat matrix with water-based juice droplets allows for greater flexibility and tailoring of both the overall fat and sugar content.'","Apple, orange and cranberry juice droplets replace half the fat content in the chocolate .

"Two High Street banks are letting customers access their money by using fingerprint technology that security experts warn ‘almost anybody’ could crack. Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest have installed the feature so that users of their mobile banking apps merely have to press a finger on to their smartphone to get into their accounts. But Professor Mike Jackson, a cybersecurity expert at Birmingham City University, claims the technology offers about as much security as ‘leaving your house keys under the front doormat’. Scroll down for video . ‘It is not something I would do – put it that way,’ he added. The banks’ apps utilise Apple’s Touch ID feature, which lets owners of an iPhone 5, 6 or 6 Plus access their device by touching the button under the screen. If the fingerprint matches one they have stored previously, the screen is unlocked. On earlier models, users must enter a numerical code instead. RBS and NatWest, both part of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, say around 880,000 of their customers have the newer iPhones so can now get into their bank accounts using Touch ID. They simply activate the technology first by inputting their usual security information. But experts claim these people may be putting their money at risk as Touch ID only examines the look of fingerprints. So criminals could easily break into someone’s bank account by using a high-quality photograph or clear image of the phone-owner’s fingerprint. Such an image could even be gleaned from the phone’s screen itself. More sophisticated fingerprint-recognition systems can detect the warmth and veins within fingers. Ben Schlabs of the German think tank SRLabs said: ‘Fingerprints are not fit for secure local-user authentication as long as “fake fingers” can be produced from these pervasive copies. It is a very different risk to something that is inside your brain [such as a PIN code].’ And Professor Mike Jackson said: ‘Almost anybody, given enough chance, would be able to break it. If you can get hold of a good finger print, it is very easy to fool [the technology]. It is that insecure.’ RBS and NatWest, both part of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, say around 880,000 of their customers have the newer iPhones so can now get into their bank accounts using Touch ID. (File image) When Touch ID was launched, a group of hackers got around it by making a fake finger from a photograph of a fingerprint. They showed how criminals could present the photograph to the iPhone’s button or use it to fashion a latex model to hold against the smartphone. RBS and NatWest yesterday said they were confident the fingerprint technology was safe to use, pointing out it was already popular with banks in the US and other countries. ‘We do everything we can to make banking secure for our customers and we’ve tested this to make sure it was safe before launch,’ they added. Mobile banking users whose iPhones are stolen can deactivate their Touch ID by calling the bank.","Users merely have to press finger to smartphone to get into their accounts .

"Royal Bank of Scotland’s bosses were warned about the danger of a computer meltdown two years before an IT glitch caused chaos for millions of its customers. But it has paid customer less than £5 compensation on average, with 2.7million receiving less than £1. The explosive details emerged yesterday as the state backed lender was hit with a record £56million fine for a botched software upgrade in June 2012 which locked millions of its customers out of their bank accounts. Royal Bank of Scotland was hit with a record £56m fine for a botched software upgrade in June 2012 . Underlining the seriousness of the failings, the fine marks the first joint penalty between City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority, established to prevent another financial crisis. Issuing its first penalty - of £14million - the PRA said the RBS’s ‘IT incident’ could have had ‘adverse effects on the stability of the financial system’ by disrupting the clearing system, which is used to settle payments among banks. Tracey McDermott, the FCA’s director of enforcement and financial crime, said: ‘Modern banking depends on effective, reliable and resilient IT systems. The bank’’s failures meant millions of customers were unable to carry out the banking transactions which keep businesses and people’s everyday lives moving.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘This is another disastrous fine for RBS after a series of failures. RBS’s priorities under Fred Goodwin meant that it neglected its IT systems, which in some cases are now decades out of date.’ The issues in June 2012 stemmed from a botched upgrade to the software that processed updates to customers’ accounts overnight. The disruption lasted for more than a week for RBS and NatWest customers, and more than three weeks for Ulster Bank, RBS’s Irish subsidiary. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘This is another disastrous fine for RBS after a series of failures' RBS admitted to ‘unacceptable weaknesses’ in its computer systems as around 6.5million customers – equivalent to 10pc of the UK population – could not pay bills or receive money and wages into their bank accounts. It revealed that it has paid a total of just over £70million in compensation to customers who were hit with overdraft charges or incurred other expenses because of the meltdown. But the lender, which promised to ensure no customers are left out of pocket, admitted this equates to an average of just £4.83 for the 4.7million retail customers of RBS and NatWest customers affected. Some 2.7m customer received less than £1 due to lost interest on current accounts and savings. The bank could not provide a breakdown of compensation for Ulster Bank and business customers. Last night one MP branded the compensation ‘derisory’. John Mann, Labour member of the Treasury Select Committee said: ‘This compensation is equivalent to not much more than a pint of beer. Yet again customers are not being looked after while people at the top get excessive pay and bonuses.’ Yesterday regulators revealed that the dangers of the ‘batch scheduler’ software failing were flagged up to management on August 1 2010, just under two years before the systems meltdown. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said: 'I want to apologise to all customers in the UK and Ireland that we let down two and a half years ago' For this reason it fined RBS for ‘breaches’ covering the period from August 1 2010, to July 2012, when the problem was finally fixed. RBS’s new chief administration officer Simon McNamara, brought in last year to clean up the mess, yesterday insisted the specific problem was ‘not explicitly called out’ to RBS bosses by internal auditors. He said the bank had committed to spend £750million by 2015 on making its IT systems more secure and added that the ‘door is open’ to customers who believe they are still out of pocket as a result of the failings. Former chief executive Stephen Hester waived his £963,000 bonus over the IT debacle. The latest fine comes as he already faces pressure to hand back a £1million long term shares bonus he received earlier this year, despite being ousted from his position last summer. Last week RBS was fined £400million by UK and US regulators for rigging the £3 trillion a day foreign exchange market under Mr Hester’s watch. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said: ‘Our IT failure in the summer of 2012 revealed unacceptable weaknesses in our systems and caused significant stress for many of our customers. As I did back then, I want to apologise to all customers in the UK and Ireland that we let down two and a half years ago.’ RBS and NatWest have 26million UK customers, 4,000 ATMs and 2,120 bank branches.","RBS has paid customers hit by a computer meltdown average of £5 each .

"Border chiefs are struggling with an enormous backlog of 276,000 immigration cases. The growing total includes asylum seekers, foreign criminals and illegal migrants and is equivalent to the population of Newcastle. MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Committee said the UK had become a ‘Bermuda Triangle’ for migrants, a country where it is ‘easy to get in, but impossible to keep track of anyone, let alone get them out’. Costs: The UK Border Agency is spending millions of pounds a year deporting people on nearly empty chartered flights . Some 21,000 new asylum cases have built up because officials were able to process only 63 per cent of last year’s applications. In addition, there are 150,000 legal immigrants who came as students and workers but whose visas have since expired. This figure is rising by 100 every day. The UK Border Agency does not know if these immigrants are still here, despite the fact they have no right to stay. Forty per cent of this group had never . been sent a letter telling them to leave the country, as all those with . expired visas should. Tens of thousands of these lapsed visa cases date back more than five years and are a legacy of Labour’s catastrophic mismanagement of Britain’s immigration system. There are also 3,900 foreign criminals living in the community and free to commit more crimes, including more than 800 who have been at large for five years or more. On top of this, another 101,000 . asylum and immigration cases remain from the backlog of more than . 450,000 found lying around in officials’ cupboards and drawers six years . ago. They were . revealed by the then Home Secretary John Reid, who described his own . department’s immigration system as ‘not fit for purpose’. Former Home Secretary John Reid, left, described his partner as 'not fit for purpose' while his predecessor Charles Clarke, right, quit after it emerged more 1,000 foreign prisoners had been released without consideration for deportation . These cases have been placed in a ‘controlled archive’ – effectively put on ice – because they cannot be found. No action will be taken against them unless their whereabouts are discovered as a result of unrelated police or local authority inquiries. Around 60 per cent of the 450,000 were allowed to stay in the country, many because so much time had passed since their application that they had settled here and had a family. Mr Reid’s predecessor Charles Clarke was forced to quit after it emerged that more than 1,000 foreign prisoners had been released between 1999 and 2006 without even being considered for deportation. Astonishingly, despite more than six years passing since that scandal came to light, 60 of those offenders remain untraced and are still at large in the UK. 'Unacceptable': Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, criticised the UK Border Agency . Keith Vaz, the committee’s chairman, said the backlog, which will take years to clear, was unacceptable, adding that the agency seems to have ‘acquired its own Bermuda Triangle’. ‘It’s easy to get in, but near impossible to keep track of anyone, let alone get them out,’ the Labour MP said. ‘This is the first time the committee has collated all the cases at the UK Border Agency that await resolution. ‘This backlog is now equivalent to the entire population of Newcastle upon Tyne.’ The cross-party group attacked Article 8 of the Human Rights Act which it said ‘weighs too heavily on the side of offenders rather than the safety of the public’. This, they said, ‘allows criminals facing deportation to live freely in our communities and to endlessly prevent their removal through spurious claims about their right to a private and family life under Article 8’. But the MPs endorsed Government changes to make it easier to remove foreign criminals, adding: ‘The rights of offenders must be balanced against the rights of law-abiding citizens to live their lives in peace, free from the threat of crime.’ The report also called for deportation proceedings to begin as soon as a prisoner is sentenced, instead of during their prison term, to speed up the process. The Home Office said: ‘This report highlights improvements we have made to tackle the huge backlog of cases we inherited. ‘Over 2,000 overstayers have recently been removed following targeted enforcement activity, foreign offenders are being removed more quickly and we are performing well against visa processing targets. ‘Talented students are welcome, but we have introduced new powers to toughen up the system, keeping out the fraudulent and unqualified. ‘The report has raised some legitimate concerns about issues that we are already tackling.’","MPs call UK a 'Bermuda Triangle', where it is impossible to keep track of people .

Chin stroking: Visitors view Precambrian Explosion, a live marine ecosystem, during the press preview . The show, which opens on Sunday, exhibits 60 of Huyghe's works over the past 28 years. It includes videos, interactive works, paintings as well as animals and fake weather that visitors have to confront. Huyghe's art, and the show as a whole, is an open environment meant to change and act randomly over time. 'I let the situation unfold; I just give the condition of a situation, but I do not know the outcome,' said the 52-year-old artist. His works like 'Human,' the white Ibizan Hound with the pink leg freely roaming the labyrinthine gallery of sharp diagonal walls, challenge easy definition. 'I might not even try,' said the show's curator Jarrett Gregory, who called Huyghe's art an outlier in the contemporary landscape. 'It's about the experience and not looking at discrete works,' Mr Gregory added. 'It's a redefinition of what we typically expect when we think of an artwork.' Enigmatic: Huyghe's works like Human, the white Ibizan Hound with the pink leg, pictured, freely roaming the labyrinthine gallery of sharp diagonal walls, challenge easy definition . Friendly: Visitors peer at Human as it makes its way around the gallery with no particularly aim in mind . Random: Visitors can step out into the California sun as machines overhead dump fake snow, fog and rain . The retrospective has already been on view at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany. The LACMA show also features the premiere of 'Precambrian Explosion,' an aquarium with a live ecosystem and floating rock. Visitors are also able to step out into the California sun as machines overhead dump fake snow, fog and rain all while the thousands of bees swarm from a concrete classical sculpture of a lounging nude woman with beehive head. Huyghe says he likes to remove viewers from our human system of knowledge making them confront animal instincts. The 19-minute film 'Untitled (Human Mask),' a confusion of human and animals, set against the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan shows a monkey in a white mask with long brown-haired wig wandering its own learned habitat: the restaurant where it works in real life. 'I'm interested in the fact that I just can't say, do this or do that ... This animal will have a survival instinct. You need to either reproduce or eat,' he said.","It's part of the 'randomness' of French artist Pierre Huyghe's retrospective .

"A father and his son have a ripper fishing tale for years to come that would make many a seaman green with envy. Dave Lock was fishing with his father, Andrew, at one of their favourite fishing spots near Carnac Island off Fremantle - south of Perth at 9am on Wednesday when some unexpected drama interrupted the beautiful calm day. Dave was filming his father, Andrew, who had just hooked a salmon and was about to reel in the fish, when a four-five metre great white shark appeared and all hell broke loose. Scroll down for video . Dave Lock thought it was just another fishing trip until all hell broke loose . The great white shark appears when it sees the salmon that is hooked by his father Andrew . At first, the shark seemed disinterested and momentarily turns away . But then the predator reappears determined to snare the salmon which is moving nearer to the boat . The five-metre shark attempted to eat the fish, which jumped out of the way, but it missed its prey and crashed into the seven-metre boat instead. The fierce impact saw both Dave, still filming, and his father hit the deck and the shark left its teeth marks behind on the side of the boat as a lasting memory. 'It touched my right knee with what must have been its nose or fin - that's how it close was,' he said. 'It happened so quickly that I didn't have time to be scared.' The 27-year-old said it wasn't until he watched the footage that he realised how surreal the moment was. 'Looking at it now I realise how insane it is - I thought ""holy cr**"",' he said. 'I was just taking a photo of dad and the shark photo-bombed,' he said. Then we drove away as it drifted off.' Dave, who has been fishing for at least 20 years, said he had seen endless sharks in his time but not such a physical encounter. 'It just goes to show how powerful they are so I think it's important to educate people that they should not be messed around with,' he said. The shark takes a snap at the salmon which jumps out of its reach just in time . Dave and the camera start to take a tumble as the shark his the side of the boat .

"A woman who was allegedly raped by top defense lawyer Sanford Rubenstein tested negative for drugs following the incident, further complicating her lawyer's attempts to have him charged. The unnamed accuser, who is an executive at the National Action Network, claims she was raped by Rubenstein, a high-flying New York attorney, in his penthouse apartment last month after the Reverend Al Sharpton's star-studded birthday party. Lawyers for the woman claim she woke up in the apartment feeling 'foggy', covered in bruises and surrounded by bloody condoms. However, a toxicology report on her blood - which was taken one week after the October 2 incident - came back clean, subsequently switching the investigation to whether the woman voluntarily or involuntarily consumed alcohol. Accused: High-flying defense lawyer Sanford Rubenstein has been accused of raping a worker for Al Sharpton's National Action Network following the Reverend's birthday party last month . Once close: Rubenstein, pictured above with Sharpton, met his accuser at the Reverend's birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan on October 1. Sharpton has since distanced himself from Rubenstein . 'If she voluntarily drank alcohol, it’s hard to prove rape, or rather, to charge him with rape,' a police source told The New York Post. Rubenstein was reportedly filmed on a security video making out with the woman and her female friend, in an elevator of his Upper East Side apartment complex, according to The New York Daily News. The woman's lawyers- Kenneth J. Montgomery and Keith White - deny this occurred. They also say the drug test does not hinder their case. 'The results of any toxicology is of no consequence considering the victim’s injuries, statement and lack of consent,' one lawyer told The Post. Rubenstein claims what happened between the two was consensual. He has not been charged with a crime. On October 3, the day after the alleged incident, the woman - a Brooklyn mother - went to the hospital suffering from vaginal bleeding and bruising. Investigation: NYPD officers are pictured above removing bags of evidence from Rubenstein's apartment. They hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy . Her lawyers claim she later used a rape kit and that the results were consistent with sexual assault. They demanded Rubenstein at least be charged with third-degree rape. The alleged attack took place after Sharpton's 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant, which was attended by New York mayor Bill de Blasio, Governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee . Rubenstein and his alleged victim met at the party and went home to his Upper East Side apartment along with a third person, who later left. After the allegations surfaced, NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7 million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan and reportedly collected 'biological evidence'. Allegations: Rubenstein has maintained the encounter was consensual. He is pictured above with a former client, one-time Playboy playmate Stephanie Adams . Denial: Rubenstein's own defense lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said a letter about the alleged victim's injuries is 'offensive and patently false' Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Sharpton has also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn't mean you're guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain't no place for that in our community. The district attorney's office told the Times the case was being investigated, and declined to comment further. Rubenstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, rebutted the letter, saying that 'all evidence to date points to consensual sex between two consenting adults, who were both active and awake throughout.' Brafman described the letter as 'offensive and patently false.'","Sanford Rubenstein is accused of raping the unnamed woman after Sharpton's birthday on October 2 .

"A man who posted videos of himself injecting substances into pregnant dogs and performing a C-section on a dog has been arrested at his home in Homestead. Lazaro Ruiz, 26, is charged with animal cruelty and resisting arrest. Police had been on the man's case for more than a year before they finally carried out a search of a townhouse in Homestead near Miami. Ruiz has now been jailed on animal cruelty charges. The dogs found on Tuesday were mostly pit bull mixes, and they are all now safe in the custody of Animal Services. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES FOLLOW... In the dog house: Lazaro Ruiz, 26, was charged with resisting arrest, battery on a police officer, animal cruelty, pretending to be a veterinarian and illegally selling animals . Four dogs are on the road to recovery after, officials said, their owner abused them and posted disturbing photos of the canines on social media . Police said some puppies were suffering from obvious injuries many of which appeared to have been inflicted onto the dogs on purpose. One YouTube video showed the 26-year old feeding the dogs a bowl of raw chicken and ground beef. In another, he super-glued the dogs' ears to pieces of cardboard after slicing them in his home, he said in the video. Police saw the videos and received pictures but were unable to act until finally a witness came forward last week with tales of purchasing pit bull puppies outside a Walmart in Florida City. He saw Ruiz administer some type of drug into the back leg of a pregnant pit bull that was having trouble giving birth. Police reportedly obtained a picture of Lazaro cutting a female dog's stomach to perform a C-section. On YouTube, investigators found a video of Lazaro who stated that 'He freshly cropped three pairs of Doberman dogs using a home remedy.' It is also believed he used scissors to crop the ears of several of his dogs. Extreme cruelty: Officials said he is responsible for putting the dogs through excruciating pain. Ruiz allegedly performed a C-section on a pregnant dog and cropped young puppies' ears with scissors. Videos showed things like dogs fighting over food, puppies locked in a kennel and a puppy eating with its ears clipped. Police said Ruiz does not have a veterinary license, and it has been illegal to own a pit bull in Miami-Dade for well over a decade. The arrest didn't come without a struggle. Police set up a fake purchase and made their way to Ruiz's home, where they had to wrestle him to the ground and an officer injured his hand during the scrap. According to authorities, Ruiz is a back-door breeder, who illegally breeds pit bulls and Doberman's to fight or to sell. 'I've been involved in animal welfare for 10 years, and honestly this is the most arrogant and outrageous case of abuse I've ever seen,' said Jacqueline Johnston of No Paw Left Behind. 'There were some bully mix dogs and one bully mix puppy with the ears removed all the way to the base of the ear.' Ruiz posted a series sick videos online showing off his pups, but cops still didn't have enough information to track him down . This two-month-old puppy has since been renamed Little Red and is said to be 'very nervous' Animal rescue workers were tipped off to this case because of several videos they say Ruiz posted online, which show the dogs being abused. One YouTube video showed the 26-year old encouraging two young Dobermans to fight over a bowl of raw chicken and ground beef . Investigators from Miami-Dade Animal Services and Homestead police first got a look at Ruiz in July when they linked an address obtained from one of the videos to his girlfriend. An inspection of the property found three adult dogs in 'grave distress,' in crates with no shade as the temperature inside the covering reached almost 120 degrees. Police caught a bigger break last week when the witness who bought the pit bull puppies outside Walmart came forward. Police set up a fake purchase on Monday, calling Ruiz and agreeing to meet his girlfriend at a Homestead fire station. The woman then took police to Ruiz's home. When police entered the home and called out for Ruiz, he came toward them swinging his fists and swearing and yelling, 'You can't touch me,' according to the arrest report. A struggle ensued, and police eventually got Ruiz under control, but not before an officer broke a finger and tore a tendon on his right hand. Miami-Dade Animal Services confiscated four dogs from Ruiz's home, all American bulldog and terrier mixes. They will be put up for adoption when Ruiz's case is resolved. Animal Services Director Alex Muñoz called it a relief 'that this individual's reign of terror against innocent animals has come to an end.' In another video he described his 'ghetto' method of cropping puppies' ears: he super-glued the dogs' ears to pieces of cardboard after slicing them in his home, he said in the video.","Lazaro Ruiz took videos of some of his alleged DIY procedures .

"Back in the 1970s and 1980s, a Wendy house consisted of 16 plastic tubes and a wad of brightly coloured material with windows and a door printed on. These days, the buildings are made of solid wood, with functioning windows, lighting and even colour schemes. But these young people's palaces don't come cheap. Scroll down for video . The two-storey properties are built by a company in Pennsylvania called Lilliput Homes . The buildings are designed for kids aged three to ten years old . These elaborate Wendy houses for toddlers modelled on castles and Victorian houses are on sale for $20,000 (£12,770). The unbelievably detailed models come with Roman pillars, slides and even castle turrets. Amazingly, some of the houses can even be hooked up to electrical mains and come with fully operable doors and windows. The mini-dwellings, designed for kids aged three to ten years old, are nearly double the price of Britain's cheapest two-up two-down property. In April, a house in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire was put up for sale at an asking price of £7,000 ($11,000). The buildings are nearly double the price of Britain's cheapest two-up two-down real house . Some of the houses can even be hooked up to electrical mains and come with fully operable doors and windows . Stephen Chernicky, owner of Lilliput Play Homes, said: 'Twenty years ago, my wife and I searched for a playhouse for our daughter, Alyssa, but were unable to discover a product special enough for our little girl. 'Soon after we created the first Victorian Mansion playhouse and Lilliput Play Homes was born. 'We take personal pride in every wooden playhouse that our company creates.' These elaborate Wendy houses for toddlers modelled on castles and Victorian houses are on sale for $20,000 (£12,770). Models are complete with Roman pillars, slides and even castle turrets . He continued: 'We share the feeling of our customers, that children should have a special place of their own to grow and discover.' If operable windows, doors and electricity isn't enough, Lilliput even give the option to customise the colour schemes inside the houses. In fact, with prices on the property market going through the roof in much of the UK, it wouldn't be too surprising if cash-strapped twenty-somethings start snapping up the buildings as an alternative to bricks and mortar.","The two-storey properties are built by a company in Pennsylvania .

"The BBC's Sherlock series featuring Benedict Cumberbatch has become an unlikely sensation in China. Recent episodes have drawn in up to five million viewers and online fan clubs of the show have attracted thousands of members. Chinese fans fill the time between seasons by writing their own stories and Shanghai now has its own Sherlock-themed cafe. Scroll down for video . The BBC's Sherlock series featuring Benedict Cumberbatch has become an unlikely sensation in China . Holmes is known in China as 'Curly Fu,' abbreviated from his Chinese name Fuermosi, and thanks to Cumberbatch's wavy hairstyle. He is also considered somewhat of a heartthrob by the Chinese audience. 'I am always super excited to see him on the screen and murmur, ""Wow, so beautiful"" every single time,' said Zhang Jing, 24, from the eastern city of Tianjin. Watson, played by Martin Freeman, is 'Huasheng', or 'peanut' and the pair of names are now the two most searched terms on Chinese social media, the Evening Standard reports. Online viewing platform  Youku.com, said an episode which aired on January 2, drew in five million viewers - its most popular ever episode. The company said that after two weeks, viewership for the third season had risen to . 14.5 million people. Benedict Cumberbatch is known as 'Curly Fu' to his millions of fans who have elevated him to heart throb status . In Britain, eight to nine million people watch first-run episodes in Britain. The Chinese obsession with Holmes could be in part attributed to their thirst for all things quintessentially British. Many wealthy Chinese nationals pay to send their children to sister schools of exclusive institutions such as Eton, and the country is the biggest importer of Rolls-Royce cars. When Prime Minister David Cameron visited China last year, fans appealed for him to press the BBC to speed up the release of the new season.","Recent episodes have drawn in up to five million viewers online .

"Three Muslim men accused of plotting to behead a member of the public days before Remembrance Sunday laughed yesterday as they appeared in court for the first time. Haseeb Hamayoon, 27, and cousins Nadir Sayed, 21, and Yousaf Syed, 19, smirked and giggled in the dock as prosecutors claimed they planned to carry out an atrocity on the streets of Britain. They were arrested days before Remembrance Sunday after police discovered their alleged knife plot. The timing of the arrests created fears of a Remembrance Day outrage and resulted in a massive security operation in Whitehall as the Queen led events at the Cenotaph to commemorate the anniversary of the start of the First World War. All three men were driven to Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London yesterday afternoon . Yesterday, the alleged plotters appeared under heavy guard at Westminster Magistrates’ Court after being charged with intending to commit acts of terrorism just hours earlier. Traffic was halted as they were brought to court in two armoured prison vans escorted by three unmarked police cars. The two bearded cousins stood defiantly with their arms crossed on being told to sit down by chief magistrate District Judge Michael Snow, nudging each other and laughing as the alleged beheading plot was outlined. Hamayoon sat throughout the hearing, nodding and waving at two older family members in the public gallery. The three men spoke only to confirm their names and addresses during the 25-minute hearing. They were charged under the Terrorism Act 2006 with intending to commit acts of terrorism and being jointly engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect to their intention. Prosecutor Rebecca Mundy said: ‘These are serious charges, the evidence of which has been set out in a lengthy case summary. The charges came a week after police were granted a further seven days to question the suspects, and a fortnight after they were first arrested . Police officers outside a house in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, earlier this month after four men were arrested in connection with an alleged terror plot . ‘In relation to that this appears to be an incident where there was an attack planned in the UK that seemed to be imminent in nature and would have involved the defendants acting together in beheading a member of the public, using knives to do so.’ Police and security services were on high alert up to and during Remembrance Sunday amid concerns that the Queen herself may have been a target. But the 88-year-old monarch defied the heightened terror threat to lay the first wreath at the Cenotaph, prompting crowds who normally watch her depart in solemn, respectful silence to break into spontaneous applause. Lawyers for Sayed, from Hounslow, West London, Syed, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and Hamayoon, from Hayes, West London, said they would not apply for bail. All three were remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on December 4. Armed police swooped on the gang on November 6, arresting the youngest at the home he shared with his mother in High Wycombe. Hamayoon was stopped at gunpoint in his car in Southall, West London. A fourth man arrested in Uxbridge at the same time was released on November 15. Police have made a series of arrests since the UK’s international terrorism threat level was raised to the second-highest rating of ‘severe’ in August, meaning an attack is considered highly likely. There are concerns that British jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq will return to carry out acts of terrorism in their home country. Islamic State leaders have also called on so-called ‘self-starter’ followers to target high-profile commemorative events. The Army has already increased security in and around Whitehall following the fatal shooting of a soldier at a war memorial in Canada several weeks ago. The Metropolitan Police said yesterday three men have been charged with terror offences .

"Given the global attention - and the challenge of making a mainstream blockbuster out of a kinky novel - it is just as well that director Sam Taylor-Johnson has great reserves of courage. Having faced colon cancer when her daughter was an infant, and breast cancer three years later, she is not easily spooked. ‘Surviving cancer does give you a remarkable perspective on life,’ she’s said. 'You take no ****, take no prisoners, and just do what feels right.’ Left to right: Author, E. L. James, actress Dakota Johnson and director Sam Taylor-Johnson at the Berlinale International Film Festival in February 2015 . And now, it seems, what ‘feels right’ is to walk away from the Fifty Shades Of Grey film - and away from its author E. L. James, with whom she has a ‘toxic’ relationship. Although she was hired to direct the film with the approval of E.L. - real name Erika Leonard - it is no secret that the two clashed exhaustingly while bringing the mega-bestselling book to the screen. They are now said to ‘despise’ each other to such an extent that the director filming the sequels is out of the question. Rather extraordinarily, Erika attempted to exert control over every aspect of the movie, turning up on set every day to watch filming, rejecting rewrites and trying to keep in as much of the sex as possible. Sam saw the film as a ‘dark fairytale’ and Erika viewed it as an erotic epic. In an interview, Sam conceded: ‘It was difficult, I’m not going to lie. We would have proper on-set barneys and I’m not confrontational.’ The two women even clashed over the final word in the film, with Sam favouring ‘red’, a ‘safe word’ used in the bedroom by the protagonists to tell the other person they have gone too far, and James insisting on ‘stop’. Sam Taylor Johnson and her husband Aaron Taylor Johnson are pictured here at the UK film premiere of 50 Shades of Grey in Leicester Square, London . And so even though she was thought to be in line to direct the two planned sequels to Fifty Shades, and even though the film has defied its critics and proved very successful at the box office, it seems Sam will play no further part in the story of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. However, when the dust settles on this outbreak of hostilities surely we will weigh the story of Sam Taylor-Johnson, 47, as more fascinating than anything created by Erika Leonard. For the woman born as plain Sam Taylor, raised in sleepy Crowborough in Sussex, has had a life which far outshines the plodding boy-meets-girl plot of Fifty Shades. Her current triumphs — she is beautiful, wealthy, successful and adored by her husband — come after a series of devastating emotional setbacks. Her story begins in 1967 in Streatham, South London, where Sam and her younger sister Ashley lived with their parents Geraldine and David Taylor. E.L James (pictured) who wrote the best selling trilogy was apparently keen to include more sex in the film . When she was nine, her father, an accountant — for a chapter of the Hell’s Angels bikers, no less — left to bike around the world and never came back. Her mother moved to Sussex to what Taylor-Johnson describes as a commune, and started to teach yoga and astrology. In Sam’s words: ‘It started as a fairly ordinary middle-class existence, then I moved into a chaotic hippie world.’ She recalled once asking her mother what religion they were, to which Geraldine replied ‘Hindu’. ‘I remember thinking, “What the f*** does that mean?” She taught yoga at my school, which was highly embarrassing.’ Sam married Jay Jopling (pictured) in 1997 and they have two daughters together . Geraldine remarried but, when Sam was 15, handed her a note to give to her stepfather — saying she was leaving — and walked out, too. Sam said in 2010: ‘My mum has lived in Australia for 22 years, and we have a rocky relationship. But at the same time it’s one I want to maintain.’ After the split, Sam lived with her stepfather, learning self-sufficiency without either parent around. At school, she felt ‘a total thickie’, and scraped through with five CSEs. She believes she was suffering from undiagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which made it impossible for her to concentrate in lessons. ‘I still find it hard to focus on any singular thing,’ she said. ‘It’s why making a film suits me: you always have to answer a million questions.’ However, she re-sat her exams and managed to scrape into Hastings Art College. From there she was accepted to London’s Goldsmiths College — studying alongside other future stars of the Brit Art scene, Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas and Marcus Harvey. She dated Jake Chapman, later famous for the artworks he makes in partnership with his elder brother, Dinos. While Sam was at London’s Goldsmiths College she studied alongside stars of the Brit Art scene such as Damien Hirst (pictured) After graduating in 1990, she worked as a dresser at the Royal Opera House and as a manager at a nightclub, but continued to make art. It was her video installation Killing Time — showing four people lip-synching to opera — which brought her to the attention of debonair Jay Jopling, the Old Etonian son of Tory politician Lord Jopling. He found her work ‘immensely moving’ and invited her to stage a show at his gallery, White Cube. He became Sam’s art dealer, and they married in 1997. The girl who used to queue up for free school dinners now lived in a house off Harley Street with a man worth around £100 million. ‘My life radically altered,’ she said. ‘I had found someone who could provide me with total stability, and I’d not really had that.’ While Sam and Jopling were married they were part of a glittering social scene that included the likes of Kate Moss (pictured) Their happiness was sealed by the birth of daughter Angelica, but eight months later, in 1997, Sam was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery. She recalled: ‘I’d look at Angelica and say, “There’s no option here. I’ve got to fight through it.”’ By this point she and Jopling were at the epicentre of a glittering if louche social scene, which included supermodel Kate Moss and the late designer Alexander McQueen. Her lifestyle, Sam said, was ‘drips by day, Prada by night’. The cancer, though, appeared to be beaten. Nearly three years later, when she was only 32, there was grim news: she discovered a lump in her breast. She had a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery in New York, arranged by her close friend Sir Elton John. Sam's mastectomy and reconstructive surgery was arranged by her close friend Sir Elton John (pictured) Doctors recommended she take the drug Tamoxifen but she refused, instead giving up dairy products and almost all alcohol, and focusing on having a calmer life instead. ‘I had been punishing my immune system. I was trying to live hard like all of my friends, and I realised that I can’t.’ Despite misgivings from her doctors, she remained cancer-free. Some of the party crowd drifted away; she had changed. She has spoken of the ‘core of steel’ she developed to deal with the disease. ‘When you’re no longer ill, that core of steel doesn’t go away, and then I had to find other channels for it.’ Sam (left) fell for Aaron (right) on the set of Nowhere Boy when she made her directorial debut and he was playing the role of a young John Lennon . Her art became ever more successful. She produced an unusual portrait of David Beckham — an hour-long video of him sleeping — for the National Portrait Gallery. In The Crying Men, she took photographs of 28 famous actors weeping. In 2006, after five cancer-free years, she and Jopling welcomed a second daughter, Jessie. The marriage, though, was over two years later. Sam fell for a partner even younger — Aaron Johnson, the young actor from Buckinghamshire playing John Lennon in Nowhere Boy, her debut film as a director. She’d been shown the script by a friend and ‘stalked the producers’ to get the job. At the time they started dating, Aaron was 19, 24 years her junior. They announced plans to marry at the film’s premiere, but had two daughters, Wylda and Romy, before the wedding. Sam and Aaron now have two of their own daughters, Wylda and Romy, as well as Sam's daughters from her marriage to Jopling, Angelica and Jessie . The besotted groom opted to take his wife’s name — so they are now both Taylor-Johnson. He has gladly spent extended periods as a househusband. Now they have a £13 million house (bought for cash) in Primrose Hill, North London, and another place in Los Angeles, and spent most of last year filming Fifty Shades in Vancouver. The family of four girls and two dogs goes everywhere with her. ‘My girls have the best woman to look up to,’ Aaron said last year. ‘She’s the strongest woman I know.’ Just don’t mention that age difference. ‘The amount of men I know with the same age gap that we have — how come no one says anything about that?’ Sam has said. ‘I try to ignore it. In my life, I’ve never really listened when people start forming opinions on how you should be doing things.’","The popular film's director says she is 'not confrontational'
No secret was made of the disagreements between author and director .
Sam saw the film as a ‘dark fairy tale’ and E.L. viewed it as an erotic epic .

"Hillary Clinton has wasted no time cashing in on the lecture circuit as it was revealed today that she will be charging $200,000 per speech. The massive fee means that she will be making more from a two-hour lecture than she did in a year as Secretary of State. The announcement that Mrs Clinton has hired a top talent agency to represent her as she begins to give paid speeches following her departure from the State Department came earlier this week, but her $200,000 asking price was only reported on Wednesday. Next gig: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has signed up with a talent agency and is commanding $200,000 per lecture, each of which will only last between one and two hours . According to Buzzfeed, that puts her in the same league as her husband former President Bill Clinton who is so in-demand that he can command the six-figure fee. The volume of the sum is made clear when looked at in comparison to her salary for a year as Secretary of State, which was $186,000. Mrs Clinton is now represented by the Harry Walker Agency which is known for getting famous politicians and newsmakers plum gigs on the lecture circuit. The venture is her first formal decision about what she is going to do now that she is no longer working, though she is widely considered to be the Democratic front runner should she decide to run for the presidency in 2016. Her decision to attach her name to his . particular New York-based agency comes as little surprise since her . husband former President Bill Clinton has long been represented by the . group since he left office in 2000. The move was clearly a lucrative one, as he made $75.6million from 2001 to 2010 from speaking engagements, making $10.7million in just 2010 alone. President Clinton is not the only big . name with the agency, as his former Vice President Al Gore has been . booking $175,000 gigs through their connections, and former New York . City mayor and Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani regularly brings in $100,000 per event. Following suit: Former vice presidents Dick Cheney (left) and Al Gore (right) are also represented by The Harry Walker Agency and are said to command $100,000 per speaking engagement . Bill Clinton- an average of $181,000, but in 2010 alone he earned $10.7million and a total of $75.6million between 2001 and 2010 . Al Gore- $175,000 . John Kerry- While working as a Senator prior to his presidential bid in 2004, Kerry averaged $1,400 per speach . Dick Cheney- $75,000 and first class travel for a three-person entourage . Rudy Giuliani- $100,000 per event and he made $9.2million on a speaking tour from 2006 to 2007 . Sarah Palin- $75,000 plus transportation . Bristol Palin- $14,000 . Charlie Sheen- $200,000 per appearance along with the use of a private jet . Kim Kardashian- Reportedly earned $600,000 from Tao Nightclub in Las Vegas for an undisclosed number of events . Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi- '$20,000 to walk the red carpet . Former vice president Dick Cheney, . former Senators Olympia Snowe and Joe Lieberman, Obama campaign . strategist Jim Messina and former Secretary General of the United . Nations Kofi Annan are all represented by The Harry Walker Agency as . well. Her exact asking price has not been . reported, but Politico asserts that she 'will likely do some speeches . for no fee for causes she champions, and expects to occasionally donate . her fees for charitable purposes'. While keeping mum about any future . presidential plans, Mrs Clinton has said that she plans to write another . book, this time about her work as Secretary of State. Publishing house Simon & Schuster . reportedly paid the former first lady an $8million advance on her first . book, Living History, which she published in December 2000. With any and all positions that she . decides to take, she will have to weigh the optics of if it would look . appropriate for a presidential candidate. That said, another concern is shoring . up a steady income, because it doesn't come cheap to live like the . Clintons and six-figure speaking fees will certainly help. Equal standing: Hillary is reportedly asking for $200,000 per speech which is the same fee that Bill charges . Though there were early reports that . they might buy a house in the Hamptons area of Long Island, it appears . now that they will hustle between their current residences in . Washington, D.C. and Chappaqua, a quiet town in the suburbs of New York . City. She is also expected to either work . with her husband's Clinton Foundation or start her own, though no . decisions about that have been made at this point. The only thing that Mrs Clinton has . publicly confirmed is that she plans to rest after a very taxing four . years of traveling to 112 different countries. As Mrs Clinton remains coy about her . political prospects, her potential competitors are being very blatant in . their fundraising attempts. On the Republican side, both New .

"With Christmas holidays and the New Year edging ever closer, a packed social diary can often mean pressure to drink more than usual. During the festive season, it has become an accepted norm that people will drink excessively, whether it be as a celebratory mood enhancer, friendly peer pressure or as a means of coping with the additional pressures that Christmas time can bring. 'People drink to have fun at Christmas, but often people are drinking to calm their nerves during social functions,' said hypotherapist Georgia Foster. 'That could be a work function or spending time with their judgemental Great Aunt Joan.' The festive season can quickly turn 'festy' as people struggle with hangovers and poor health, because of some crucial errors they make when drinking. People drink to have fun at Christmas, but often endless parties, functions and family lunches means people can fall into unhealthy habits and drink to excess too frequently . A list has been devised of ten tips to help avoid over drinking at Christmas, to avoid hangovers, embarrassment and long-term damage . However, feeling nasty the next morning isn't the only reason why curbing your drinking is a wise decision. Extreme drinking, even once a year, can have catastrophic effects on long-term health and many people are completely unaware that the amount they drink is considered harmful . One in five adults drink at levels that place them at risk of lifetime harm. More than two in five adults drink at levels that put them at risk of an alcohol-related injury, according to a 2014 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report. In fact, one-in-five drinkers aged 18 years and over in 2012-2013, drank at levels exceeding the 2009 guidelines for long-term and lifetime drinking risk management. Ms Foster is a leading clinical hypnotist and the creator of the Drink Less Mind program, which helps individuals reduce the amount they drink . Although expert Georgia Foster says is perfectly acceptable to drink and be merry at Christmas time, she has devised a list of tips to help people minimise hangovers and embarrassment in December. She says it is important to be mindful of not only how much or how fast you are drinking, but also the reasons why you keep filling your glass. Ms Foster is a leading clinical hypnotist and the creator of the Drink Less Mind program,which helps individuals reduce the amount they drink. Ms Foster says stopping altogether may not necessarily be the answer but learning to control your drinking this Christmas can increase a person's happiness. Anybody who find themselves drinking to feel better need to drink to feel better is displaying a negative relationship with alcohol, according to Ms Foster. 1. Decide before you go out how much you are going to drink over the hours you are there and stick to it. 2. Put a message or photo on your phone to remind you of an embarrassing drunk memory. When you are considering drinking more than you had planned, look at the image or message. You most likely will not reach for another drink! 3. Finish each drink before you have a top up so you can gauge how much you are drinking. 4. Opt out of all cocktails and punches. They can be lethal and hard to tell how much alcohol is in them. 5. Do not be coerced into drinking to please others. Tell little white lies if you need to. Such as: Feign you are taking antibiotics or just a little under the weather. Even better, tell people you have a ‘cracking hangover’ and couldn’t fathom a drink! 6. DOWO Policy. Drink one, water one. Alternate between alcohol and water, to keep you hydrated. 7. Drink from your non-dominant hand. It will seem a little uncomfortable, so it will make you more aware of how much you are drinking. 8. Drink a big glass of water before you start drinking, to hydrate yourself. You will often drink alcoholic beverages too fast if you are thirsty. 9. If you are shy or bored, instead of reaching for the alcohol to calm you down or entertain you, shift your thinking to something funny and sing silently “baa baa black sheep” at the same time. This will distract your mind away from self doubt and shift your thinking into a positive state. 10. When feeling anxious, take one deep belly breath and count to five. Repeat that three times. When you breathe into that part of the body you make more endorphins. You physically change the chemical make up of your brain to feel happier.' Although it is perfectly acceptable to celebrate with drinks at Christmas, there are some crucial errors that people make which result in over-drinking . The solution may not simply be about ditching the drink altogether but rather re-establishing the relationship with alcohol, and learning how to enjoy it at a minimised intake. 'I specialise in why people drink,' said Ms Foster. 'I'm Australian and I get it! I'm not against drinking.' 'The top of drinking is often taboo when it shouldn't be because it's a part of our culture.' Ms Foster says drinking for fun or for celebratory reasons is understandable, but often there are emotional reasons that dictate how we drink and how much we consume. 'For a lot of people it's not their drinking but their thinking that is the real problem,' said Ms Foster. Ms Foster says drinking for fun or for celebratory reasons is understandable, but often there are emotional reasons that dictate how we drink and how much we consume . Ms Foster says there are two important problems to address when it comes to a person's drinking habits: why they drink and how they drink. 'There are emotional drivers that make people drink that they're unaware of,' she said. People may feel the need to drink because of their insecurities, a problem which Ms Foster helps to correct through teaching mindfulness, self-awareness and positivity. A person's negative thinking, known as their 'inner critic', comes from 'the negative part of their brain' called the Amygdala. Neuroscientists have proven that alcohol affects the Amygdala, stopping these subconscious thoughts and helping the person to calm down. Drink a big glass of water before you start drinking, to hydrate yourself. You will often drink alcoholic beverages too fast if you are thirsty. Also drink a glass of water between every alcoholic beverage . 'If a person in the past has used alcohol as a mood enhancer or to silence these thoughts, it often becomes a learned behaviour,' said Ms Foster. A lot of people are socially shy and use alcohol at those times to relax or feel more confident. 'Christmas is a time that can trigger a person's vulnerability and drinking is a way to numb that,' said Ms Foster. 'People often don't realise it when they're drinking to escape negativity.' People frequently make basic mistakes when drinking, which results in drinking too quickly or consuming more than planned. One hilarious, but understandably effective way to make sure you don't drink too much is by using photos on your phone. Ms Foster recommends putting a message or photo on your phone to remind you of an embarrassing drunk memory. 'When you are considering drinking more than you had planned, look at the image or message,' explains Ms Foster. 'You most likely will not reach for another drink!' Ms Foster recommends putting a message or photo on your phone to remind you of an embarrassing drunk memory to avoid overdrinking . If a person is feeling uncomfortable, they should change how they feel instead of drinking to mask their emotions. A breath is often all it takes. 'When feeling anxious, take one deep belly breath and count to five. Repeat that three times,' said Ms Foster. 'When you breathe into that part of the body you make more endorphins. 'You physically change the chemical make up of your brain to feel happier.' Positive thinking also prevents drinking to mask feelings of self-doubt or anxiety. 'If you're going into an environment that will make you feel vulnerable, imagine a time with a laugh or a time where you felt love and your brain will shift. 'You will feel positive and also learn that the positive memories are part of the social space and the drinking issue.' The benefits of drinking less during the Christmas period include less hangovers, reduced weight gain, increased energy and often increased confidence . She says the problem is when people become accustomed to alcohol and need to drink more to experience the same sensations. 'As your body gets used to drinking, the one glass that used to make you relax doesn't have the same effect. 'Your brain doesn't get the same fix so it asks for more.' Christmas is a time to unwind and relax, but Ms Foster says the time will be even more enjoyable if people take care of themselves and find a way to drink for enjoyment. 'I think the great thing about not drinking to excess is that your self-esteem improves. 'Anxiety reduces and you become more confident and calm socially when you're not relying on alcohol to make you feel better.' There are also a plenitude of physical benefits. 'You don’t put on as much weight, you eat better because you're not looking for the carbs the next day when you're hungover. 'Your relationship with yourself improves when you're not running away from yourself and your life,' says Ms Foster. 'Life is much more fun and interesting when you are confident so you only need a couple of drinks or no drinks. 'It's better when you feel like you don’t need to drink with that intensity.' Life is much more fun and interesting when you are confident so you only need a couple or no drinks .","In Australia it has become acceptable to drink to excess throughout the festive season .

"For decades, they have been as much a part of Wimbledon as Pimm’s, strawberries and queuing. But it seems ball boys are on the brink  of extinction – at least as far as the  commentators are concerned. In a sign that political correctness has reached the courts of Wimbledon, the traditional ‘ball boys’ and ‘ball girls’ are being replaced with the rather more modern ‘ball kids’. Renamed: In a sign that political correctness has reached the courts of Wimbledon, the traditional 'ball boys' and 'ball girls', some who met the Duchess of Cornwall yesterday, are being replaced with the rather more modern 'ball kids' Sue Barker twice used the description on BBC1 yesterday as she reported on the Duchess of Cornwall meeting ‘ball kids’ during her visit to the tournament. And despite the All England Club insisting it had no plans to stop using the term ball boys, its official Wimbledon website also described how Camilla had greeted a ‘row of ball kids’. It follows repeated use of the ‘ball kids’ expression during BBC 5 Live’s coverage of the recent French Open. Commentators are said to find it less cumbersome than saying ‘ball boys and ball girls’, and snappier than ‘ball children’. Tennis sponsors are also helping the drive to eradicate the traditional ball boy by increasingly using the new phrase. Barclays runs an X Factor-style ‘ball kids’ competition to select youngsters aged 12 to 16 to collect balls at the ATP World Tour Finals. Meeting: Despite the All England Club insisting it had no plans to stop using the term ball boys, its official Wimbledon website also described how Camilla had greeted a 'row of ball kids' Entitled The Barclays Ball Kids Programme, it uses regional and national trials to whittle down around 2,500 applicants to just 30, who are then trained to help on the court. The phrase is already well used overseas too – including by the man who created the first modern ball boy training programme at the French Open in the Seventies. Ridha Bensalha told the New York Times in a recent interview: ‘I’m  hard. The ball kids like this. You  know, they do it because I must be hard with them.’ But Wimbledon spectators are less keen on the change, and yesterday expressed disappointment at the decline of the traditional expression. Martha Stephens, 54, who was attending her third Championships, said: ‘It just sounds like they are trying to make tennis cool. Wimbledon doesn’t need to be cool, it has decades of tradition.’ Ball boys were first used at Wimbledon in 1920, and were originally provided by Shaftesbury Homes  for deprived children. Ball girls were introduced to the Championships in 1977 and they first appeared on Centre Court  eight years later. Both the boys and the  girls received a modern makeover in 2006 when their uniforms were changed from shirt and shorts in Wimbledon purple and dark green club colours to a Polo Ralph Lauren design in blue. Ball girls also swapped skirts for shorts in 2001. There are 250 ball boys and girls working at this year’s Championships, made up of volunteers from local schools who got through a rigorous selection process. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The use of “ball kids” is occasionally used in tennis commentary but less so than “ball girl” and “ball boy”. ‘There is no official BBC policy on this and it is often dependent on how much time a commentator has to describe a situation rather than an intentional or required use of either.’ A Wimbledon spokesman was adamant that it had no plans to stop using the phrases ‘ball boys’ and ‘ball girls’. We could be seeing a lot more of Judy Murray considering she’s tipped to join the next series of Strictly  Come Dancing. In the meantime, it seems she’s determined we don’t forget her. The tennis coach made a celebrity appearance for a coffee company yesterday just hours before attending her son Andy’s second-round match. Service: Judy Murray made a celebrity appearance for a coffee company yesterday just hours before attending her son Andy's second-round match . With his own bid for glory at Wimbledon, Maria Sharapova's boyfriend can't always attend her matches. Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov insists he supports her 'from far away'. And it looked as thought she was rather enjoying the attention as she handed out drinks to delighted spectators and posed for photographers. The event organisers wouldn’t reveal if she received any payment. Asked about her rising profile, 54-year-old Mrs Murray said: ‘I don’t think I am a celebrity. I am a coach and for me it’s nice to able to raise the profile of tennis, talk as a parent and a promoter of women’s sports. ‘I definitely get recognised a lot more so I tend not to be able to go anywhere quickly.’ Three hours later, Mrs Murray watched her son defeat Slovenian Blaz Rola in straight sets.","Commentators replace traditional 'ball boys' and 'ball girls' with 'ball kids'

"Scientists have found a way to make a decayed tooth repair itself, using a laser beam . If you hate going to the dentist, this may bring a smile of relief to your face. For scientists have found a way to make a decayed tooth repair itself, using a laser beam. The breakthrough could mean many patients will no longer need painful and costly treatment. As well as making trips to the dentist a lot more pleasant, it could also see dentures bite the dust. Just a five minute blast from a laser was enough to kick-start the healing process inside the mouth, researchers found. While the experiments were on rats, the team – which included experts from the U.S. government’s dental research arm – hope to test the technique on people soon. They began by making a small hole in the dentine, the hard core of the tooth that often rots away. They then shone a low-power laser on the tooth for five minutes. Twelve weeks later, new dentin had formed, the journal Science Translational Medicine reports. Further experiments revealed what lay behind the laser’s healing effect. The blast of intense light activated a chemical in the mouth which ‘woke up’ stem cells – master cells which act as a repair system for the body – deep within the tooth. These stem cells were then able to form new dentine. Scientists have managed to make an entire living tooth before but previous work has been done in a dish in a lab. The new technique should be better, as the repair is done in the mouth and uses the body’s natural processes. Researcher Praveen Arany, of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research in Maryland, said that if other parts of the tooth can also be regenerated, the technique might replace painful and expensive root canal treatment. Being able to do major repairs to rotten . teeth in this way would also mean fewer dentures, which are not as good . for oral health as living teeth, which provide a more natural bite. The . repairs would also have massive psychological benefits for patients . self-conscious about their smile. The breakthrough could mean many patients will no longer need painful and costly treatment . Unfortunately for those who fear the dentist’s drill, fillings would still be necessary for some types of decay. Dr Arany, a dentist, hopes to test the technique on people soon. Professor Chris Mason, an expert in regenerative medicine from University College London, said: ‘I think it would be popular with patients because it would be low-cost and rapid and involve minimal surgery. It would also be popular with the health care providers who have to foot the bill.’ However, he cautioned that regrowing the enamel, the hard surface of the tooth that allows us to bite and chew food, will be much more difficult. ‘It’s a great start but ultimately you’d want to have enamel too,’ he said.","Laser beams can make a decayed tooth repair itself, say U.S. scientists .

"Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer has extended an olive branch to his troublesome senator Jacqui Lambie, saying she's a team player who he wants to keep on board. It comes after the pair engaged in a public spat over Senator Lambie's pledge to vote against all government legislation until a defence force pay deal is reconsidered. There's speculation Senator Lambie may quit PUP, but she's taking the weekend to think over her position in the party. Scroll down for video . Clive Palmer has toned down his language in his war of words with Jacqui Lambie, saying he cares about her as a person and hopes she'll stay with PUP . The outspoken senator has accused her party leader of trying to intimidate her and interfere with her role in the Senate. Prompting retaliation from Mr Palmer, he lashed back at the rebel senator and accused her of lying in parliament and scheming to start her own political party. But despite the war of words, Mr Palmer isn't giving up Senator Lambie, urging her to talk to him in person rather than through media. Mr Palmer said previously that Senator Lambie had failed to attend party meetings and had not returned his phone calls or spoken to him for a month. 'I think she's a team player and we'd like to keep her on board,' he told ABC's Lateline on Thursday. 'If she wants to have a talk I'd have no problem doing that.' Mr Palmer said he did not know where Senator Lambie's accusations of intimidation had come from and his party had done all it could to support her. He excused her behaviour as a result of media pressure to break up the PUP team. There's speculation Senator Lambie may quit PUP, but she's taking the weekend to think over her position in the party . Mr Palmer on Wednesday demoted the senator from her parliamentary positions of deputy Senate leader and deputy whip and suspended her from all party meetings. After removing PUP logos and references from her website, the Tasmanian senator split from her party colleagues in the upper house to vote against the government on a series of motions. Senator Lambie has thrown her support behind the Australian Defence Veterans Party which is in the final stages of getting enough supporters to register with the Australian Electoral Commission. She denies she wants to set up her own party. During their war of words, the senator also said she will not be told how to vote by anyone and claims her only boss is the people of Tasmania. But Mr Palmer says the outspoken senator hasn't brought a single proposal to PUP about Tasmanians or about veterans. 'She just wants to have a fight about nothing which is not a rational way to behave as a respectable senator,' he said in a statement. She later accused Mr Palmer of spreading rumours about her and causing her personal distress. He previously labelled Senator Lambie a 'drama queen' after she accused him of flip-flopping over her stance on Defence pay.

The camera works by reconstructing 3D images from photons reflected from barely visible objects. The technology could be used in next generation spy cameras or to treat eyes that are easily damaged by bright light. The camera works by reconstructing 3D images from photons reflected from barely visible objects. On the left is an image created by using current technologies, while the image on the right uses the scientists' new device . Researchers from MIT have managed to create sharp images of dimly lit objects using photons, which are elementary particles that are not composed of smaller particles. Using mathematics, they stitched together information gleaned from the tiny particles of light, which were recorded by a solid-state detector in the camera. Electrical engineer Ahmed Kirmani and his colleagues at the university developed an algorithm to look at correlations between neighbouring parts of an object lit by pulses of light as well as the science of low light measurements, Nature reported. The time it takes for photons from the laser pulses to be reflected back from the object and read by the detector, provides information about the depth of the object being examined . The camera works by scanning an object using low-intensity pulses of laser light. Each pulse is fired until a reflected photon is recorded by a detector and using the algorithm, each illuminated location is matched to a pixel in the image that is created . Mr Kirmani said they did not invent a new type of laser or detector, but applied their algorithm to an off-the-shelf photon detector. The camera works by scanning an object using low-intensity pulses of laser light. Each pulse is fired until a reflected photon is recorded by a detector and using the algorithm, each illuminated location is matched to a pixel in the image that is created, according to the journal Science. The camera uses a process made up of multiple steps to remove noise from the laser scan made by detecting a single photon for each pixel. This process produces the final image, which is sharper than that created by rival technologies . The time it takes for photons from the laser pulses to be reflected back from the object and read by the detector, provides information about the depth of the object being examined. This technique is currently used in hi-tech devices to determine the nature of 3D structures, but the team’s algorithm provides the same information using one-hundredth the number of photons required by other light detection and ranging techniques, which are used to map areas remotely. The images are in black and white as the laser produces light of a single wavelength, but the device can pick out some different materials because of the rate they reflect the laser’s colour. Darker regions of objects tend to need more pulses of light to hit them before being reflects, according to the scientists.","MIT scientists developed a camera that works by reconstructing 3D images from photons reflected from barely visible objects .

"Strict new rules have been introduced after an increase in overseas visitors not eligible for free NHS care . Patients are having to prove they are entitled to free NHS care when they go to hospital in a crackdown on health tourism. They are asked for evidence showing they have lived in Britain for at least a year by producing bills, pay slips or bank statements. The one-year rule has existed for many years but has clearly not been effectively enforced. Clampdown: Staff working at Southend Hospital in Essex must ask patients if they have lived in the country for the past 12 months . Recent figures suggested that as much as £40million is owed to hospitals by so-called health tourists who have been treated but never paid their bills. The checks apply to outpatients and those admitted to wards, but not to emergency cases, who will be looked after regardless. The scheme has been introduced to identify foreign patients who try to get free care on the NHS, despite not being eligible. Doctors and nurses at Southend University Hospital in Essex ask all patients coming in for the first time whether they have lived in the country for at least a year. Health Minister Simon Burns (pictured) last year revealed that health tourists have taken at least £35million of free treatment over the last eight years. That is the sum health service bosses have written off after foreign patients came to the UK for treatment – and left without paying. The Department of Health is still trying to recover millions more from thousands of others who have abused British hospitality, so the real figure could be far higher. Entitlement to free NHS hospital treatment is based on a patient being ‘ordinarily resident’ in the UK. Anyone else will be charged for the full cost of any treatment they receive unless an exemption applies to the particular therapy.While treatment in an accident and emergency department is automatically free to all, emergency care elsewhere is not. However urgent treatment, such as maternity care, will always be given regardless of residence status or ability to pay afterwards. UK Border Agency officials see 150 cases a year at Gatwick Airport of heavily pregnant passengers arriving with visitor visas. Last year the Home Office and Department of Health admitted the existing system 'is still too complex, generous and inconsistently applied.' They promised stricter checks to make sure the details of overseas patients are properly recorded so hospitals can recover any debt. Also those visitors who have run up £1,000 or more in medical debts will not be allowed back into the country. They may also double check by going back through medical records of previous treatment. And if staff are still suspicious, they will ask patients to provide proof of address. Julie Alabaster, private and business manager at Southend hospital, said the expansion of the nearby airport and coastal port could lead to an increase in the number of health tourists. She added: ‘We know that people won’t always tell the truth and we won’t be able to capture everyone. ‘But we need to be doing everything we can to get money back from patients who are not entitled to NHS treatment for free.’ She said those who were ineligible for free treatment would be asked to pay by cash or via a chip and pin machine brought to their beds. The trust is owed £64,913 by health tourists. But many trusts are out of pocket by far more, including St George’s in South London, which is owed £2million. Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who has been exposing the cost of health tourists to the NHS, said: ‘This is a very sensible idea, for which the hospital should be commended. ‘All NHS trusts should be applying this test which should be rolled out nationally. 'We need to get a grip on the issue of foreign nationals abusing the NHS – it is a national health service, not an international one.’ Similar schemes have also been introduced at The Hillingdon Hospitals Foundation Trust in West London, East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust and Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust in Surrey. Last month, figures obtained by Pulse magazine through freedom of information requests showed that hospitals were owed an average of £230,000 from health tourists. Yet despite the crackdown on health tourists, it has also emerged that some doctors have been threatened with legal action if they do not treat illegal immigrants. One surgery in Essex was recently told by human rights lawyers they would be taken to court if they refused to add a group of failed asylum seekers to their books. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘Hospitals have a legal duty to recover any charges made to overseas patients. ‘We have changed the immigration rules so that anyone with an unpaid debt to the NHS of £1,000 or more can be refused a new visa.’","Staff working at Southend Hospital in Essex must ask patients if they have lived in the UK for the past year .

"A 21 stone woman gave birth to a baby boy four hours after doctors revealed she was expecting, her size having disguised her pregnancy for a staggering 38 weeks. Sophie Bird was a size 24 when in September 2010, she was preparing to be bridesmaid at her best friend's wedding. In the months leading up to the big day, Miss Bird had visited the doctor 10 times, complaining of indigestion, stomach ache and nausea. But nobody spotted she was pregnant. Scroll down for video . Four hours after doctors told Sophie Bird she was pregnant she was cradling baby Rowan in her arms, having been rushed to A&E, where medics revealed the stomach pain she was experiencing was, in fact, labour . In the months leading up to her friend's wedding, where Miss Bird was to be bridesmaid, the 21 stone 29-year-old visited the doctors around 10 times complaining of stomach aches, nausea and indigestion. But due to her size, no one spotted she was pregnant . Two days after the wedding, and suffering severe stomach pain, Miss Bird visited the doctors once more. A test confirmed she was pregnant, and the expectant mother was referred straight to A&E where an examination revealed she was 4cm dilated and in labour. Four hours later, the new mother was cradling baby Rowan in her arms. She said: 'It was the biggest shock of my life, I was completely stunned. 'I had managed to carry a baby without changing shape or size for nearly nine months. 'I had been fitted for my bridesmaids dress in May and the dress still fitted in September - just before I gave birth.' As a child, Miss Bird had been a big eater, but exercised regularly and maintained her weight at around 14 stone. When she left school, a daily diet of takeaways and alcohol saw her weight spiral to 19 stone. 'I actually got stretch marks from putting weight on so quickly,' she said. When she was 17, Miss Bird met her partner Carl. Together they spent evenings on the sofa watching TV and eating takeaways. In the next seven years their relationship fell into a rut, and Miss Bird turned to food to numb the pain. At 21 stone, and needed size 24 clothes. Miss Bird, who has since lost eight stone and aims to shed two more, said: 'It was the biggest shock of my life, I was completely stunned. I had managed to carry a baby without changing shape or size for nearly nine months' 'At . various points in my life, I’ve tried to lose weight,' she said. 'I think I’ve . tried every diet going - Weight Watchers, 5:2 and Atkins. 'They all worked for a while, but none of them were sustainable, so whatever weight I lost, it all piled back on, and more. 'I would look at myself in the mirror and feel numb. I could look after, and be kind to other people, but not myself. 'I started acting like a clown around my friends to cover up the sadness I had inside. 'I was really unhappy and that made me want to eat more and more. 'I wore a tent every day to cover myself up. I never felt normal or attractive. I used to say to myself; my life is about quiet resignation now - this is as much as I can expect.' 'It was the biggest shock of my life, I was completely stunned. I had managed to carry a baby without changing shape or size for nearly nine months' - Sophie Bird . In the months leading up to her friend Aimee's wedding in 2010, Miss Bird said she visited the doctor about 10 times, complaining of indigestion, stomach ache and nausea.' I was on the pill, and as a child I’d been diagnosed with polycystic ovaries - they told me I’d need help to conceive, so it never dawned on me that I could be pregnant,' she said. 'Two days after Aimee’s wedding, I was in so much pain at lunchtime that I rang the doctor and made an appointment for 5pm. 'This time, the doctor did a pregnancy test and confirmed I was pregnant, but no-one knew how many weeks. 'The doctor sent me of to A&E where I had an internal examination. I was told I was 4cm dilated and in full labour. 'Straight away a porter put me in a wheelchair and pushed me across the car park, at some crazy speed, to the maternity unit. 'It was all nuts, I couldn’t believe what was happening.' Miss Bird said she had no idea she was pregnant. She was on the pill and had been told by doctors she suffered polysystic ovaries, and as a result would struggle to get pregnant. She said having been fitted for her bridesmaids dress in May 2010, no adjustments were needed by the wedding in September, just two days before Rowan was born . The now 32-year-old gave birth to baby Rowan on September 22, 2010 . A Malory Band is a narrow, adjustable cord that is worn around the waist. It feels tighter as you eat, making people more aware of the amount of food they are eating. The band was designed as a psychological gastric band, which acts as an alarm bell warning slimmers not to over eat. The brainchild of former Rally Driving Champion and TV presenter Penny Mallory, the device can also improve posture, encouraging its wearer to sit and stand taller to avoid the tension of the band when slouching. It is versatile and can be work all day, every day, even in the shower or swimming pool/ . Malory Band also helps maintain the weight a person has lost - as the band starts to feel tighter, it becomes an early warn sign that the pounds might be creeping back on. The band has a unique button-hole system, allowing it to be made smaller as you lose the inches. You can stop the inches creeping back on by continuing to wear the band - so your weight loss product turns into your weight maintenance programme. It is available in various sizes and can be decorated with clip-on charms that mark your progress. Four hours after learning she was pregnant, baby Rowan was born at 9pm. She said: 'It was completely surreal. One minute my life was normal, next minute I had a beautiful little baby boy. 'I had no baby stuff so my friends and family rallied round to get me all the baby equipment - they were amazing.' But it was eight months later, on her 30th birthday, that Miss Bird discovered her boyfriend was having an affair with her best friend. 'It completely broke me,' she said. 'I kicked him out and was so traumatised and so stressed by it all that I couldn’t face eating. 'I felt constantly sick, and as a result my size started to shrink. 'I knew that this was the right time to get control back of my life, my body, my mind and my eating. 'I set my mind to losing the weight and vowed never, ever put it back on. 'Over the next few years I took up Morris Dancing and Roller Derby to keep active. 'I also joined the gym and made sure I did some form of exercise every day. 'I changed my diet to fresh, healthy food and limited my portion size. The weight started to drop off me. I lost 5 stone and was feeling fantastic - energised, happy and confident.' In May, a friend told Miss Bird about Malory Band, a new way to monitor and motivate weight loss. The device is a narrow cord that sits around the waist and starts to feel tighter as a person eats. It acts as a 'psychological alarm bell', triggering the brain to think about the amount of food it needs. Miss . Bird, who has lost eight stone and plans to shed another two stone by . next summer, said: 'It was just what I needed. I wish I had known about . it before. 'I love it because it’s not a diet. I . make all the decisions about what I eat and my Malory Band reminds me . when I have had enough to eat. It’s so simple and so effective - . everyone should have one. Eight months after Rowan was born, Miss Bird's weight loss was kick started after she discovered her boyfriend had been having an affair with her best friend . The 32-year-old who has lost eight stone to date, credits her weight loss to a device known as a Malory Band - a cord around the waist, pictured,  that acts as a psychological gastric band, reminding people when they are full . 'When I started wearing the Malory Band, it would start to feel tight when I ate, and so I'd stop eating. 'It made me realise I didn't need to carry on eating, and the weight came off so quickly. 'I was still having a healthy diet, but the band was literally reining me in and making me constantly aware of what I was putting into my body. 'I can't express how happy I am about losing the weight. I have more confidence and energy and am a much happier person. 'Before, I'd go out with my friends and just want to hide away as they were all so slim and healthy. 'I feel alive and I am so much happier. And of course, now I have my wonderful Rowan, he’s the sunshine in my life.' And she has vowed never to watch as the weight piles back on. 'I guarantee you won't ever see me that size again,' she added. 'My Malory Band is like a best friend that supports me and stays with me constantly, and it will help me to lose another two stone. I know the weight will never return.'","Sophie Bird visited the doctors in the months prior to giving birth complaining of indigestion, stomach ache and nausea .

"Britain's housing boom has now spread to every major city, a new report shows. The top 20 cities in the UK are all experiencing annual house price growth of 5 per cent or more for the first time in a decade. Market analysts Hometrack said the housing recovery had finally reached northern cities such as Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow and was no longer the preserve of the south. House prices are rising rapidly across many of Britain's cities according to a new report . The three cities with the highest house price growth year-on-year are London at 18 per cent, Bristol at 13 per cent and Cambridge at 12 per cent, although momentum in these markets is slowing. The lowest house price growth was recorded in Glasgow and Liverpool, where it is five per cent, but these cities are continuing to see house prices rising. There is still some way to go, however, with 11 of the 20 cities recording house prices below the current UK average. In Liverpool and Glasgow, house prices are 40 per cent below the national average. London bucks the trend with an average house price of more than double that of the UK at over half a million pounds. It comes as experts predict prices will rise faster in the UK than London next year because the capital has reached an affordability ceiling. Estate agents Savills recently forecast that property prices will flatline in London in 2015 but rise by 10 per cent on average elsewhere in Britain. Richard Donnell, Research Director, Hometrack, said: ‘The pick-up in house prices that started two years ago has spread across all UK cities. House hunters in London, however, could see prices flatline in 2015 but rise by 10 per cent outside the capital . ‘By the end of the year, we could well see monthly house price growth in London slipping below that of some of major cities outside the south east.’ Official figures show house prices are rapidly rising in the east and south-east as workers in London found themselves prices out of capital. Values in London increased by 19 per cent on the previous year, although prices have fallen back from the record levels seen in August, according to the Office for National Statistics. In contrast, prices in the East grew at its fastest rate in more than a decade at 13 per cent, while prices in the south-east rose by almost 12 per cent. Economists said property in London, which now cost on average £508,000, had become so high that workers had been forced to move to the outskirts of the commuter belt. This had driven up the cost of property in the Home Counties and beyond. London, £402,800, 17.3% . Bristol, £217,300, 13.2% . Cambridge, £331,000, 12.2% . Portsmouth, £194,700, 9.4% .

"A hospital has suspended cancer surgery over fears that five patients died unnecessarily within a year. Keyhole operations on patients with cancer of the oesophagus have been halted with immediate effect, the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust announced yesterday. The hospital had been one of the few areas in the country to do the operation and surgeons had been travelling around the world lecturing about its benefits. Five patients died from 'potentially avoidable' complications after surgery at Maidstone Hospital . One of the patients who died was a 51-year-old father-of-one, whose lawyers say he was cajoled into having the procedure and ‘made to feel like a human guinea pig’. The Mail understands that the surgeons filmed the operation on him last July –and it was broadcast live to a medical conference taking place in the UK . The same man died 16 days later from a blood clot and his family are now taking legal action against the trust. Bosses have refused to name the surgeons involved, but the trust confirmed that the surgeons were still working, although the matter has been referred to the General Medical Council – which may decide to suspend them. The trust has also luanched its own internal inquiry. Solicitor Sharon Lam, acting for man’s widow, told the Mail: ‘There seem to be serious questions to be asked about the reliability of the procedure in question. New surgical techniques are vital but they must not be tried out on patients until they are safe.’ Initially, the patient was due to have the standard open surgery to remove the tumour as  which has a longer recovery period. But days before the operation, surgeons persuaded him to have the keyhole surgery, as he would recover quicker. He also consented  for the procedure to be broadcast live at  a conference. Miss Lam said: ‘He was made to feel really lucky to have this surgery rather than the conventional open surgery.’ Upper GI surgery has been suspended and the trust is now sending patients requiring it to St Thomas' Hospital in central London instead . The operation went well and 11 days later the patient was discharged. Five days later he suffered a major haemorrhage. He was taken to hospital, but died the next day. Miss Lam added: ‘My client, the man’s widow, is very upset by the whole episode. She wrote a letter of complaint  to the hospital and the surgeon replied. ‘It is highly unusual as complaints are normally dealt with by the hospital trust, not by the consultant. He said there had been complications that had led to the patient’s death. He did not say sorry or give any kind of apology.’ She added that the patient should have had a good prospect of recovery, but instead his death has left his family traumatised. The keyhole operation normally lasts four hours, and involves removing the tumour and surrounding tissue using a microscopic camera and surgical instruments. At the same time surgeons use part of the stomach to create a section of oesophagus to replace the infected section. Patients of the trust in Kent are being sent instead to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London. Medical director at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells trust, Dr Paul Sigston, said: ‘We are sorry that some patients did not receive the level of care and treatment that they should have due to potentially avoidable surgical complications. ‘We are in contact with, and have apologised to, the families who have been affected and have been clear that we need to make improvements.’","Scandal involves upper gastrointestinal surgery at Maidstone Hospital .

"Veterans of the D-Day landings will receive public funding to make the annual pilgrimage to the Normandy beaches where they fought for our freedom, George Osborne will announce today. The Chancellor has set aside money raised from fines on the big banks to ensure that veterans can continue making the trip to France each year for as long as their health allows. Treasury sources said Mr Osborne had been moved to act by the scenes in Normandy earlier this month when around 650 veterans gathered with world leaders to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion. Hero's welcome: Care home staff with Bernard Jordan after his headline-grabbing trip . Mr Osborne, whose grandfather won the Military Cross in the First World War, told the Daily Mail: ‘These amazing people are an example to the world. Hearing their stories last weekend about what they went through and the comrades they lost was truly humbling. ‘It is only right that they should be able to travel back to Normandy every year and I am delighted that we can make it happen. ‘It is fitting that the money paid in fines by people who have demonstrated the worst kind of values is being used to help and support those who without doubt have demonstrated the very best.’ Last night George Batts, secretary of the Normandy Veterans’ Association, said: ‘It is a bloody marvellous gesture and there will be a lot that take it up.’ Mr Batts, who cleared mines from Gold Beach on D-Day as an 18-year-old Royal Engineer, added: ‘We are closing the national association later this year as people get older, but a lot of the branches are still active and a lot of us still want to go. ‘I hope to still be going when I’m 110. It has got a bit expensive to go back and this will help enormously – I hope the banks commit a few more misdeeds!’ Over the years veterans have received lottery cash to help make the annual pilgrimage to Normandy, but this source of funding is due to end next year. Under the new scheme, funding will be provided to allow every veteran who wants to make the trip to France to do so. Cash will also be available for carers to help those who are too frail to travel alone. It will cover both transport and accommodation. A Treasury source said there was ‘no cap’ on the number of veterans who could take up the offer. It will operate indefinitely. Chancellor George Osborne said: 'It is only right that they should be able to travel back to Normandy every year and I am delighted that we can make it happen' The money will come from hundreds of millions of pounds in fines levied on banks involved in the Libor scandal, where they colluded to fix the interest rate at which they lent money to each other. Mr Osborne changed the law in 2012 to allow the cash to go to good causes associated with the military and emergency services. Tens of millions of pounds has already been paid out to groups including military charities, search and rescue groups, air ambulances and the Imperial War Museum.  A spokesman for The Royal British Legion, which will operate the new scheme on behalf of the Treasury, said: ‘We’re excited to play a role in such an important part of the remembrance experience for our veterans and pleased the Treasury has extended this funding.’ ‘It is fitting that the money paid in . fines by people who have demonstrated the worst kind of values is being . used to help and support those who without doubt have demonstrated the . very best.’ - George Osborne . Last night the initiative was welcomed by Bernard Jordan, the D-Day veteran whose ‘Great Escape’ to the 70th anniversary commemoration enchanted the nation. Speaking ahead of his 90th birthday today, he said: ‘That’s great. That sounds like a good idea.’  After failing to get on an official trip, Mr Jordan walked out of his care home, boarded a train and then caught a ferry to Normandy so he could take part in the 70th anniversary commemoration. But when he disappeared from The Pines Care Home in Hove, East Sussex, staff became worried about him and contacted police. By the time he returned safely to Britain he was front page news. Mr Jordan witnessed the heroism and the horrors of D-Day on  June 6, 1944 from his ship the Endeavour, where he was serving as an electrical engineer, supplying tanks to the British troops invading northern France. Other D-Day veterans also welcomed the news that the Treasury would pay for them to return to Normandy to honour their fallen comrades. Former Royal Marine Bill Bryant, 89, from Exeter, Devon, said he thought it was a ‘great idea’. Mr Bryant, who was 19 when he landed on Gold Beach, added: ‘I have just returned from Normandy and it was a very emotional trip. I cried a lot. But I am so glad that I went. It will stay with me forever. Treasury sources said Mr Osborne had been moved to act by the scenes in Normandy earlier this month when around 650 veterans gathered with world leaders to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion . ‘I was very lucky in that the Royal Marines paid for my trip, but I know a lot of the other vets had to foot the bill themselves and it can be very expensive, especially when you’re on a pension like we all are. ‘What a great thing for the Government to do – shame they didn’t do it in time for the 70th anniversary though.’ D-Day veteran Cyril Ager, a former sapper with the Royal Engineers who landed on Gold Beach, said the scheme was ‘wonderful news’. Mr Ager, 90, from Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, paid for his trip to France for the anniversary, and it cost more than £1,000. He said that although it was ‘emotional to return’ it was a great honour to do so. ‘It would be a huge help to have the trip paid for as I had such a good experience going back there,’ added Mr Ager.","Veterans of D-Day landings to receive public funding to make annual trip .

"Wicked Campers is in hot water again four months after the company promised to remove offensive slogans and art work from its vehicles. Tourists in Far North Queensland have been shocked to see one of the controversial vans parked at popular visitors spots featuring cartoon penises styled according to different racial stereotypes. The van also features the slogan: 'My c**k just died. Can I bury it in your backyard...' Dot Miller saw the van when she was visiting Millaa Millaa Falls, south of Cairns, with her daughter on Saturday and said she thought it was 'awful', the Cairns Post reported. Tourists are offended by a van featuring cartoon penises styled according to different racial stereotypes . The van also features a provocative slogan and has been seen at popular tourist spot Millaa Millaa Falls . 'I'd be upset if my grandson had hired it,' Ms Miller told the Post. 'I would think it's quite offensive to most people. I can't work out why anyone would do it.' The van features images of male genitalia dressed up next to the names of countries, including 'Africa' which is styled with a bone through its hair, 'Israel' which is wearing an Orthodox Jewish hat and hairstyle and 'Cuba' which is fashioned to look like a cigar. The 'Australia' cartoon is a picture of Tony Abbott. On the other side of the van is a 'Jamaica' cartoon penis with dreadlocks, 'Japan' wearing a sumo wrestler belt, 'Egypt' wrapped up like a mummy,' 'Mexico' with a sombrero and mustache and England wearing a top hat, bow tie and carrying an umbrella. The van is currently rented out and on its way to Sydney. A spokeswoman for the Advertising Standards Bureau said the organisation was aware of the van - which also advertises the Wicked Campers website - but was unable to act unless it received an official complaint. This comes just four months after the company promised to remove offensive slogans and art work . A spokeswoman for the Advertising Standards Bureau said the organisation was aware of the van - which also advertises the Wicked Campers website - but was unable to act unless it received an official complaint . This comes after Sydney mum Paula Orbea launched an online petition for the company to remove offensive slogans which reached over 127,000 signatures in only four days in July. Following the petition Ms Orbea said the company promised it would review and remove sexist and misogynistic marketing from all of its vans within the next six months. Apart from offering a personal apology, Wicked Campers also said in the statement that it has removed the original phrase that led Ms Orbea to create the petition when her 11-year-old daughter repeated it to her word-for-word - 'In every princess, there's a little slut who wants to try it just once'. The apology, which is published in full on Ms Orbea's blog under a post she titled 'My daughter thanks you too', reads: . 'Anybody who is familiar with our brand would probably know that we are strong proponents of free speech and pushing the limits of humour – we are a ""cash for chaos"" kind of company. Sydney mum Paula Orbea launched an online petition which reached over 127,000 signatures in July . In July the company promised it would remove sexist and misogynistic marketing from vans within six months . 'As is often quoted ""A sense of humour is a sense of proportion"". And in this instance, we admit that we have taken things out of proportion and out of the realms of what is considered to be ""socially acceptable"".' It continues with: 'Wicked Campers Owner, John Webb wishes to acknowledge the prevailing community opinion by REMOVING the slogan in question and making a commitment over the coming six months to changing slogans of an insensitive nature. 'In the spirit of being ""actionist"", Wicked Campers also invites anybody who feels strongly offended by a slogan to either paint or tape over it.' Ms Orbea said she was overjoyed at the result, calling it a 'people power win'. 'It was an overwhelming show of community support,' Ms Orbea said in July. This is the phrase Ms Orbea heard her 11-year-old daughter say word for word before starting the petition . 'The kind of sexism and misogyny on those Wicked Campers vans isn't trivial – it's degrading to women, harmful for our children to consume, and condones a rape culture that sees one-in-three Australian women sexually assaulted in their lifetimes. 'I'm pleased my daughter said something, and that we stood up against it. It's important that we call out sexism wherever it exists.' In a blog post, Ms Orbea gave thanks to everyone that had supported her petition as well as outlining the reasons for her protest. 'My motives never were, nor do they continue to be, about bringing down Wicked Campers – it was to remove certain morally offensive slogans,' she wrote. 'In fact, if this petition causes the company to reevaluate their business model to better fit the ethical standards of society – well, wouldn't that be the best victory of all?' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Wicked Campers for comment. The company said it was a strong proponent of free speech and pushing the limits of humour .","Van features male genitalia dressed up according to racial stereotypes .

"A car restorer father has come together with his salesman son to turn rust to riches. The strength of their combined reputation, restoring luxury cars and selling them, has business booming for the father-son duo. But to make more money expanding their London business, they’re first going to have to lay down some serious money on renovating a new site to launch their first dealership location. Lance McCormack owns Romance of Rust - one of Britain’s best car restoration businesses. Mr McCormack was trained as a traditional panel beater, manufacturing the parts by hand. After working to manufacture Rolls Royce parts, Mr McCormack used his skills to his advantage and became the go-to man for luxury car repairs. Lance (left) and Merlin (right) McCormack work together to restore and sell rare luxury vehicles . Lance McCormack is expanding his car dealership business and moving next to his father's car restoration business . His son Merlin hasn’t come from such humble beginnings - instead trading off his father’s good reputation as a high quality panel beater for over 30 years - and runs car brokerage firm Duke of London. With business booming, Merlin has found a showroom right next to his father's car restoration business.

"John Correia is a senior pastor at the West Greenway Bible Church in Glendale Arizona and also a fully qualified National Rifle Association firearms instructor. The father-of-four normally has a bible in one hand and an AR-15 assault rifle in the other while spreading the word of the lord. Correia lives with his wife Laura, 38, and his four children Phoenix, 17, James, 15, Sarah, 12 and eight-year-old Abby in Phoenix, Arizona. Former US Naval officer John Correia believes that Jesus wants him to preach using both his Bible and an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle at his Arizona church . The married father-of-four is a senior pastor at the West Greenway Bible Church in Glendale Arizona, pictured, where he regularly preaches about Jesus and guns . John, left, alongside wife, Laura, Sarah 12, eight-year-old Abby and James 15, are all fans of their various firearms, apart from eldest daughter Phoenix, not pictured . Of the four children, eldest daughter Phoenix has no interest in firearms. But her younger brother James is an NRA apprentice instructor. He owns his own Browning BLR hunting rifles, a Remington 870 20 gauge shogun, several .22LR rifles and a Kahr CW9 pistol. Sarah, 12, is the proud owner of a shotgun, while 8-year-old Abby received a pink Crickett .22 single shot rifle for her birthday. Correia, who is a former US Navy officer has his own personal arsenal consisting of more than 20 weapons. The evangelical Christian owns three break-action shotguns, a Glock 19 handgun as well as an AR-15 rifle. The AR-15 rifle is the 'civilian' version of the M16 assault rifle used during the Vietnam war. The AR-15, however, does not have a fully-automatic fire setting, despite this, it was able to kill effectively in the Sandy Hook and Colorado theatre massacres. Correia said: 'A guided tour of the different firearms that I own, that would take a while. 'A running joke is if you know how many firearms you own, you probably don't own enough.' As well as a pastor, Correia is also a fully qualified firearms instructor with the National Rifle Association and enjoys passing his knowledge onto his family at the range . John, left, holds the front of the AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle steady for his son James while out in Arizona, surrounded by hundreds of spent cartridges . John, left, with daughter Sarah, said the only way he would ever willingly give up his firearms was if Jesus personally told him to do so . And despite the Bible's 'turn the other cheek' message, the 38-year-old pastor says scripture clearly justifies the use of lethal force. John said: 'What fuels my passion for guns and self defense? First and foremost my Christian faith. 'I wish everyone got along, I wish that everybody was nice, but they're not. And until we get into that perfect world where Jesus comes again, we need to be able to protect ourselves and in Luke 22:36 I believe Jesus said ""let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one"". 'People ask me all the time, well what about peace on Earth and goodwill to all men? Absolutely true, I believe very strongly in what Paul says in chapter 12, verse 18 - he says if possible as far as it depends on you be at peace with all people, and I'm a peace lover, I'm friendly if you meet me. 'But you know what? There are some people who won't be at peace with you.' And while the former Naval officer's message may be controversial, his views go down well with his congregation. But as his wife Laura acknowledges, his love of guns has not been to the taste of all his fellow worshippers. The trainee midwife said: 'If they are against guns, very against guns, they're probably not going to stay at our church for a long time. I will just honestly tell you that. 'And there have been some people that have left because they don't like his stance on guns, they don't like it being brought up in church, they don't like the fact that he'd go out to shoot with fellow members of the church.' Members of John's church have left his congregation because of his views on the use of firearms and the fact that he will go shooting with some of his flock . As well as preaching in church, Correia runs a popular Females with Firearms Facebook page and believes that women should be taught how to shoot properly . Correia claims that while is in favour of 'Peace be with You' he acknowledges that not everyone is peaceful and it is necessary to be well prepared just in case . Alongside his Active Self Protection website, the preacher runs the popular Females With Firearms Facebook page and is a big advocate of women learning how to shoot. 'Listen, I'm a martial artist, I have a teaching rank in a derivative of Kempo and I know that I am big enough that somebody who is 100lbs, I can bum rush you, I can get through your martial arts, pin you to the ground and beat you to death,' he said. 'I know I can, but you know what I can't do? If you've got a firearm, I can't get past that. That's a force multiplying tool, especially if we have distance, so I think that's why females especially should be taught self-defence, especially with the use of firearms, because they're effective.' Surprisingly, Correia and his wife were raised in San Fransisco Bay area in California, which has fairly draconian firearms laws compared with Arizona. She said: 'I was extremely afraid of guns going into my teenage years, to the point that this sporting goods store I worked at when I was a teenager, I would not even touch the guns, I wouldn't bring them out to show anyone.' However, after her husband decided to buy a weapon for home defense, Laura resolved to conquer her fears and learn how to handle firearms properly. She added: 'Now I feel very competent, I feel safe, I feel powerful, not in a ""ha-ha, look at me I can shoot this gun and nobody can mess with me"" way, but in a more protective, feel powerful against somebody that might try and hurt me sense.' Abby, 8, holds her pink Crickett .22 rifle said 'I like shooting because it is fun. My friends at school think guns are really dangerous and we should never own a gun' The Correia family with some of their arsenal of more than 20 firearms. According to the Pastor, if you know exactly how many guns you own, you don't have enough . According to Correia, if the President Obama attempted to take away his firearms by removing the Second Amendment, 'that would cease to be a legitimate government' And John and his children regularly head out on hunting trips or to the gun range for a spot of target practice. Eight-year-old Abby said: 'I like shooting guns because it's fun. 'My friends at school think guns are really dangerous and you should never own a gun. I think that it's okay to own a gun as long as you know how to use it and when it's okay to use it and where it's okay to use it.' While high school shootings like Sandy Hook have created a backlash against gun ownership in parts of the States, they have made the pastor even more determined to pass on his gun skills to his young family. He said: 'If you look at the murderer, the rampage that happened at Sandy Hook, that young man murdered his mother to steal her firearms, to then transport them in the cause of a felony, which was another felony, took them on a school campus. 'He murdered 25 more people - and when did he stop? He stopped when the police cars pulled up, he took his own life because good men with guns were there to stop him, and as soon as they were, he stopped. 'A rifle in the hands of a good man is good, a rifle in the hands of an evil man is evil. So what does God think of guns? It's just a tool.' Correia regularly takes members of his family on hunting trips using some of the wide array of firearms which he currently owns . He said: 'I wish that everybody was nice, but they're not. And until we get into that perfect world where Jesus comes again, we need to be able to protect ourselves' The couple both have a concealed carry permit, but the couple carefully restricts their children's access to firearms and only lets them use them under careful supervision - while all guns are technically owned by John. He added: 'The firearms in my house have about as much appeal and mystique to my children as the mop in the kitchen. It's not something that's taboo, it's not something that's off-limits.' Unsurprisingly, the preacher is a firm believer in the US Constitution's Second Amendment - the right to bear arms. He said: 'How would I react if the state wanted to take away my firearms? 'I do believe that a government of the USA that tried to do that would cease to be a legitimate government.' But with guns still firmly legal in Arizona, he will continue to spread his faith in God - and firearms - to his devoted flock. 'You can kind of get to be this caricature where people call me the Pistol Packing Preacher, or my ex-employees used to call me Minister Malice but my first and foremost commitment is to Jesus Christ,' he added. 'If you said John, Jesus came and said give up your firearms today and you can show me definitely it's Jesus, I'd give em up, because my commitment to Jesus comes first. 'But I don't think he does, I think he says ""John, you're a bearer of the image of God, so protect that. Protect it in smart ways"", and firearms today are the best way to do that.' He said: 'You can kind of get to be this caricature where people call me the Pistol Packing Preacher, or my ex-employees used to call me Minister Malice'","Former US Navy officer John Correia now preaches at the West Greenway Bible Church in Glendale, Arizona .

"More than 15million viewers stayed up to watch England kick off their World Cup campaign at 11pm on Saturday night. But when all was said and done, our boys had slumped to another defeat ... and the nation needed a scapegoat. Yet for once the national team had given fans a performance to be proud of – and so it was the BBC’s hapless pundit Phil Neville who bore the brunt of their frustrations. Former England player Phil Neville has been criticised for his co-commentary by fans and celebrities on Twitter . South Warwickshire police joined others on Twitter mocking BBC co-commentator Phil Neville . The force tweeted jokes about him as part of its safety campaign during the late-night match . Saturday was Neville’s first appearance as the Corporation’s new star pundit, and could prove to be his last after a brisk Twitter backlash. While England’s players ran Italy close on the pitch, Neville appeared to be out of his depth in the commentary box. Fans made fun of his robotic voice and dull insights, with some asking if he could be hauled off at half-time. He will be absent from England’s next two group games, which will be broadcast on ITV. However, the BBC has refused to say whether Neville would return if the team makes the knock-out rounds. The former England player, providing co-commentary alongside BBC regular Guy Mowbray, was compared by one viewer to the computer HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Another suggested he would be better off presenting the Shipping Forecast. Former Liverpool and Germany star Didi Hamann was among the stars criticising Neville's commentary . Despite also working for the BBC, comedian Danny Baker joined the backlash against the former player . Jokes about Neville lightened the evening for England fans, as the team slipped to a 2-1 defeat . Broadcaster Mary Ann Sieghart branded the former Everton midfielder's voice 'talking Temazepam' He was even mocked by the police, with . the South Warwickshire force’s official Twitter feed providing a string . of safety advice based on his disastrous performance. ‘At . least we know Phil Neville won’t stir the crowds in the pubs into a . frenzy. Drink sensibly,’ read one message, while another claimed . officers ‘will be playing recordings of Phil Neville all night to keep . the streets all calm and sleepy’. Some . fans asked whether it was possible to fire a commentator at half-time, . while former Liverpool midfielder Didier Hamann wrote: ‘If Phil Neville . reads his Twitter feed he may not come out for the second half.’ More than 13million viewers stayed up until the final whistle, just before 1am yesterday morning. The . Corporation could not yet say how many viewers complained about . Neville’s commentary, as weekend figures only become available on . Mondays. Some fans linked physio Gary Lewin's injury to Neville's dull performance in the commentary box . Tottenham MP David Lammy joked that, with such a dull voice, Neville may have a future in politics . Neville was signed up by the BBC after retiring from Everton last year and regularly appears on Match of the Day . Part of the team: Neville is part of the BBC team of pundits and co-commentators for the World Cup . It stressed that Neville had received training before being allowed on-air but, when asked whether he would return for the BBC’s next live England game, a spokesman said: ‘Everything for the final 16 will be decided much closer to the time.’ Critics suggested Neville’s appointment showed the folly of the BBC favouring ‘big names’ over seasoned professionals for its punditry team. Luckily, Neville – the brother of England assistant coach Gary – seems to have taken the comments in good spirits. He tweeted last night: ‘Sometimes you have to take the criticism – it will only make me better. Thanks for the feedback (ahhahaha)!’ The BBC gave England’s fans false hope after just a few minutes, when its on-screen graphic incorrectly put England 1-0 up. The blunder came after Raheem Sterling thumped a shot at goal from 30 yards that appeared to fly into the top corner. ‘Goal’ flashed up on the BBC’s coverage, and the score in the corner of the screen was changed to ‘ENG 1-0 ITA’ – but viewers were bemused to see Sterling fail to celebrate after such an excellent strike. In truth, Sterling’s shot was off-target, with the net only bulging because the ball had hit the side netting. The BBC swiftly rectified their error.","Commentator's performance panned as fans brand him 'dull' and 'robotic'

Iram Leon, 32, was first over the finish line at the Gusher Marathon in Texas with a time of three hours, seven minutes, and 35 seconds, but insisted he 'came in second' behind daughter Kiana. Keen runner Mr Leon, who was diagnosed with brain cancer shortly after turning 30, has already completed half a dozen races with Kiana, after deciding he no longer wanted to compete without taking his 'princess' along. Scroll down for video . Father-daughter duo: Iram Leon, who has brain cancer, crosses the finish line with daughter Kiana at the Gusher Marathon in Texas, U.S. But Mr Leon had a battle on his hands to get the pair their first joint marathon medal even before the race began, as prams are not typically permitted on the lengthy routes. He was turned down for entry four times before the Gusher Marathon agreed to let the father-daughter duo compete, according to a report on the Huffington Post. The team of two, who completed their first half-marathon in October 2012, went on to take home gold in the marathon in Beaumont on Saturday. Mr Leon, who has been told his cancer will not be cured, said: 'The one thing I'm not going to say on my death bed is, ""I wish I spent more time with my kid"".'

Doctors hope he will live to see his 40th birthday. Mr Leon is divorced from Kiana's mother and his daughter lives with him the majority of the time at his home in Austin, Texas. The devoted father has told Kiana about his illness, and said he hopes to strike the right balance between protecting her from his experience and sharing it with her. Kiana has witnessed her father suffering seizures as a result of his illness and the pair practice what to do in an emergency should Mr Leon suddenly need urgent medical attention. Iram Leon . His brain tumour, which affects his memory . and language skills, means Mr Leon can't drive, work, or play contact . sports, but his cancer has not hampered his ability to run. It's 'just one foot in front of the . other', said the determined father, who writes a blog about his . experiences of coping with cancer. In it he described being 'floored' as he realised he was in the lead at the half-way mark on Saturday. 'Was there a possibility that I could win not a division, not an age group but a marathon with my inspiration directly in front of me?' he wrote. Devoted: Mr Leon said cancer had not hampered 'my ability to run and love' Mr Leon, who said he was 'sore' and 'grateful' after the marathon, recalled listening to Bon Jovi's hit It's My Life as he pushed his daughter ahead of him throughout the gruelling race.

"It seems this summer's heatwave came with an ugly side. Waterways from Wales to Norfolk have turned an unsightly shade of green as a result of toxic algae blooms. The soaring temperatures, combined with sharp downpours washing fertiliser into ponds and lakes, has led to a larger than usual explosion of algae. Unsightly: Toxic algae blooms seen covering the surface of the Paddington canal basin in London are being blamed on recent soaring summer temperatures . Marred: Paddington Basin is just one among many picturesque spots across the UK that have been marred by the presence of the lurid green algae . A total of 137 cases of algae have been reported to the Environment Agency since January, compared with 127 last year, a report in the Telegraph said. As well as marring beauty spots, blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, poses a risk to the health of humans and animals. The green slime, which has been sighted along the Welsh coast, the Norfolk Broads, and Shropshire's glacial meres, starves fresh water of oxygen - threatening fish living in canals or lakes. It can cause neurological and digestive problems if ingested by livestock, while in humans it can prompt convulsions or liver failure. The lake in London's St James's Park is among the bodies of water coated in green scum. Sightings: A total of 137 cases of algae have already been reported to the Environment Agency since January, compared with 127 last year . The Environment Agency has used special pumps to aerate several lakes during the hot summer months, boosting oxygen in the water back to levels safe for fish. John Hughes, a spokesman for The Wildlife Trust, told the Telegraph: 'Blooms are very in-evidence this year in particular, with huge swathes of lakes covered in algae. 'When there is too much of it in the water the fish are effectively suffocating - we’ve seen a number of cases of it in the last few years. The algae blankets out the light and takes up the oxygen, which cuts off the supply for everything living in the water.' According to the Veterinary Poisons Information Service (VPIS), 24 dogs have died or had to be put down as a result of algae poisoning. Scum: The Environment Agency has been aerating lakes across the country blighted by the algae, which starves fresh water of oxygen and can cause fish to suffocate .","Potentially harmful blue-green algae sighted everywhere from Welsh coast to Norfolk Broads .

"The Czech Republic's top celebrity website have claimed British women are not beautiful using the winner of the Miss Great Britain beauty pageant as a prime example. The website Extra.cz claimed that Shelby Tribble, 21, from Plymouth, was not good-looking enough to told the title of a beauty queen. They felt so strongly about Shelby's appearance that they went as far as to pixelate out her face on their site. Scroll down for video . Rude: Czech gossip website Extra.cz blurred out Miss Great Britain winner Shelby Tribble's face . Miss Great Britain: But a Czech website described Shelby as an 'ordinary, regular, non-interesting blonde' and said she 'proved the rule that British women are not beautiful' The Czech gossip website said traffic for their articles about the Miss Great Britain beauty contest had gone through the roof after they declared the winner was not good looking. In one of the first reports they included the headline: 'Great Britain has new Miss and she proves the rule that British women are not beautiful.' It included the pixelated photo of Shelby, who has won a number of beauty queen titles in the UK. As well as being crowned Miss Great Britain 2014/15, she has also been crowned Miss South West, Miss Hippodrome 2014, Miss Loaded 2014 and has been a Miss England finalist. Multiple crowns: In the UK, Shelby has also been crowned Miss South West, Miss Hippodrome 2014, Miss Loaded 2014 and has been a Miss England finalist . Facing adversity: The 21-year-old said competing in pageants has help rebuild her confidence after being bullied at school . But the Czech article concluded that if she was to take part in a Czech beauty pageant, she would not even make the finals. Publishing photos of the other Miss Britain contestants, it said: 'Ordinary, regular, non-interesting blonde beats approximately 40 competitors. If you want to know why look no further than this gallery.' And it pointed out that there was no surprise that famous British women like Emma Watson, Kate Middleton, Kate Moss, Cara Delevigne, Keira Knightley and Kate Winslet had decided to steer clear of the UK event. Shelby, here competing in Miss Great Britain as Miss South West before she won, has not always been so self confident . It said: 'It seems that the really beautiful British women that the UK produces prefer to invest the time in a career, leaving the beauty contests to the rest.' In the Czech Republic, they said, beauty contests were at whole new level because they actually had women that were worth looking at. They said: 'It's not really a surprise, hear in the Czech Republic it is an interesting event. The show is broadcasted live on national TV and the winner becomes a famous celebrity. 'But look at the British event, no celebrity guests, no four-hour-long show and most importantly, no beautiful girls.' Exceptions: The article describes Englishwomen Emma Watson and Kate Middleton as two of the most stylish women in the world and questions why British beauty contestants are so 'ordinary' The story, which was a viral hit for the website, was then developed with further stories including one that said: '10 finalists for the English Miss contest that will make your eyes water. Such monsters are hard to find!' The author then admits that they deliberately chose the ugliest but points out that they were nevertheless staggered that they ever made it even to the final. It said they had no dress sense, cheap shoes and relied on revealing intimate body parts rather than real natural beauty in order to win votes. Shelby, whose story was published on MailOnline this week, is no stranger to facing cruel taunts. She describes herself as 'painfully shy' after being bullied at school and had to overcome low self-esteem in order to triumph as a beauty queen. She said competing in beauty pageants and modelling has helped her turn the tables on her tormentors and gain a sense of self worth.","Extra.cz blurred out Miss Great Britain winner Shelby Tribble's face .

"A British inventor has done the seemingly impossible - and reinvented the wheel. The Loopwheel system uses springs instead of spokes, giving the wheel built in suspension. The £600 wheel is set to go on sale in September following a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to raise money for the project. Scroll down for video . Reinventing the wheel: The Loopwheels use large springs instead of spokes to give the bike wheels built in suspension . The Loopwheels will go on sale in September for £600, and their inventor claims they can make riding on a bumpy road 'like riding on velvet' 44 year old Nottingham mechanical engineer Sam Pearce told MailOnline he came up with idea while watching a mother try and push a child in a buggy up a kerb. 'In 2007 I was sitting in an airport in Holland, and I noticed when a mother pushed a pushchair against a kerb, the baby was pushed forward. 'I suddenly wondered why the wheel couldn't have its own suspension, and quickly drew the idea down - and then did nothing about it for two years. 'Then I had a spare afternoon and remembered the idea, so decided to make a model with springs made from plastic . guttering I bought from B&Q and a pencil as a hub - and it worked perfectly'. The Loopwheel works using three heavy duty springs instead of spokes. When the rider hits a bump, the springs compress to give a smooth ride . Springs inside the distinctive wheels compress as the rider encounters rough terrain . Sam Pearce's original sketch for the wheel in 2007 . Mr Pearce, who usually designs parts for pushchairs and other vehicles, has spent four years perfecting the idea. The current version is constructed from carbon composite strips developed in conjunction with an archery bow manufacturer. 'I first made myself a mountain bike wheel, and it was incredibly noisy and wouldn't steer - but it worked. 'I've now been working on making it a product for 4 years, and we've made 40 . wheels and 200 springs to get it right. The first wheels are designed around the 20-inch wheels commonly used on fold-up bicycle, and Mr Pearce plans to sell bikes with the wheels fitted for £1200 in September. 'We're at preproduction - we've made wheels, but we're now hoping to get funding for tooling so we can mass product them, and we are planning to spend the next two months getting production ready.' A Kickstarter project has already raised £48,000, exceeding the £40,000 target needed to get production started, and Mr Pearce, who is developing the wheel with his wife Gemma, admitted he was stunned by the response. 'We were very surprised by the response, 4 weeks ago nobody knew about them.' Mr Pearce said riding the wheels is a unique experience. 'When you first sit on the bike, it feels normal. 'But as soon as you ride,on a gravel . road, it feels like velvet - there is no noise from the road, and it is . exactly like riding a normal bike. Once the 20inch wheel is in production, there are plans for a larger version for mountain bikes and even the possibility of a car version in the future. 'There is no reason it couldn't work in a car - although there are some big technical issues to solve. 'The biggest problem we've found so far is that you tend to ride through bumps quickly, slowing down for corners becomes a problem and you end up riding so fast.","Large springs give the Loopwheels built in suspension .

"Arsene Wenger has fuelled talk of a potential future move for Porto striker Jackson Martinez by implying he will be the next big player to leave the club. The Portuguese giants have notoriously sold their stars to Europe's biggest clubs for hefty transfer fees in recent times with Ricardo Carvalho, Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez just three examples of their policy. And speaking to beIN Sports as part of an interview about Porto, the Arsenal boss was full of praise about their prized asset - adding that the striker would equip himself well in England's top flight.

"Four American women of Chinese descent are suing Sephora for allegedly blocking and deactivating the accounts of 'Asian-sounding' customers during a 20per cent off sale. The women, Xiao Xiao, Jiali Chen, Man Xu, and Tiantian Zou, who live in New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, have filed a class action complaint in a New York federal court against the beauty retailer. 'Sephora has blocked and/or deactivated customers of perceived Chinese/Asian descent based on the ill-founded and discriminatory belief that all Chinese/Asian customers abuse discount sales to engage in bulk purchasing for re-sale,' the claim states. Controversy: Sephora is being sued after allegedly blocking customers with 'Asian sounding names' from its website. Here, a shopper is seen browsing items at the retailer's Grand Central location in New York City . The plantiffs’ lawyer, Wigdor LLP, believes Sephora will have to pay damages 'well into the millions,' according to Styleite. Sephora was quick to issue an apology via its website, blaming a high level of bulk purchases from 'automated accounts'. The statement read: 'What caused the disruption yesterday was a high level of bulk buys and automated accounts for reselling purposes from North America and multiple countries outside the US.' The company made no reference to the accusations of ethnic profiling but explained that 'we have identified certain entities who take advantage of promotional opportunities to purchase products in large volume on our website and re-sell them through other channels. 'After careful consideration, we have deactivated these accounts in order to optimize product availability for the majority of our clients, as well as ensure that consumers are not subject to increased prices or products that are not being handled or stored properly.' In complaints posted on Facebook and Reddit, users noted that those registered under Asia-based email addresses, such as qq.com and 126.com, were among those blocked – though customers with 'Asian-sounding' names registered under a U.S. or Canadian address were also affected. Reddit user huaer, who first posted about the controversy on the site's MakeupAddiction forum Friday, expressed disappointment with the store's response. 'I do not agree with the way Sephora has handled the situation, and believe that they have disappointed many of us in these past few days,' she wrote. Angry customers continued to post grievances on the company's Facebook page. Chenyi Ebe Zhu, a California resident who hails from Zhuhai, in China's Guangdong province, wrote: 'Thank you Sephora. Thank you for blocking my account, which makes me decide NOT to shop at Sephora any more. Why should I still give my money to such a racist company?' Shuo Wang, of Waterloo, Ontario, wrote on Facebook: 'My online account is locked without any reason! I am really disappointed at it!' Nanjing University student Zoey Shen added: 'I want to unlock my account because I am not a reseller. I just want to buy something for myself.'","Four customers are suing Sephora for allegedly blocking and deactivating the accounts of 'Asian-sounding' customers during a 20per cent off sale .

"As the birth place of reggae music and the Rastafarian religious cult Jamaica has long been associated with cannabis. Now high ranking officials of the Caribbean state want to legalise the widely used but illegal drug – in a bid to spark a tourism boom. They believe promoting the controlled sale of the narcotic will bring tens of thousands of extra tourists to the island which has suffered from a faltering economy and high unemployment. Jamaica wants to attract people like these two young women to their island to boost tourism . Supporters hope to follow the example of the US state of Colorado which has raked in a fortune after the sale of cannabis was decriminalised – and taxed – on January 1 this year. Angel Brown Burke, the mayor of Kingston, Jamaica’s capital, said: ‘The time has come to provide an opportunity for Jamaicans to benefit from the marijuana industry.’ The drug – known locally as ‘ganja’ - is widely grown and used throughout the Caribbean, especially Jamaica. Farmers have also mounted a campaign to legalise the drug, under the banner ‘Wake Up Jamaica’. Ganja grower Clinel Robinson, 69, said: ‘If they know they can come into a ganja field and police wouldn’t come, thousands, they would come. ‘Hotels would be full of people. Everybody would benefit.’ Jamaican reggae star Bob Marley popularised the smoking of cannabis and was often photographed and filmed using the drug. Rastafarians consider the herb sacred to their religion. However cannabis can cause mental health problems, lung damage and lead to the use of harder drugs. Uruguay became the first country to make it legal to grow, sell and consume cannabis last year . In April dreadlocked Rastafarians and farmers held a rally in Kingston to launch their bid to decriminalise the drug. Jamaica is a major exporter of cannabis with more than 37,000 acres devoted to growing the narcotic crop every year. Uruguay became the first country to make it legal to grow, sell and consume cannabis last year. Details of how the scheme will work are to be unveiled shortly.","Politicians believe promoting the controlled sale of the narcotic will bring tens of thousands of extra tourists .

"Meriam Ibrahim faces up to seven years in jail over new offences levelled at her by the Sudanese regime, MailOnline can reveal today. The mother-of-two was told the devastating news after being detained as she tried to fly out of the African country hours after a death sentence against her was dropped. Dr Ibrahim, 27, was charged with obtaining a false travel document and giving false information to immigration officials - and banned from leaving Sudan. Scroll down for video . Cruel twist: Meriam poses hours after her release with her husband, Daniel . (left) and her children, Martin (on Daniel's knee) and baby Maya and all . those who bravely fought for her freedom in Sudan. Now they have all been thrown back in a jail cell after they were arrested for trying to leave the country . Secrets: The family were seized by the National . Intelligence Security Services, dubbed the 'Agents of Fear' by Amnesty . International, which accused them of a catalogue of abuses. They have now been transferred to police custody where they are all locked up together . The move is another twist of the knife as Dr Ibrahim tries to get to America with her two children where she can live with her husband Daniel Wani, a US citizen, from Manchester, New Hampshire. Instead she is back in a cell with her son Martin, 21, and daughter Maya, one month. Mr Wani is also locked up with them at the Al Sheradee police station in Khartoum after being confronted at Khartoum airport by 40 agents of the feared National Intelligence and Security Services. It is believed they were trying to travel to Washington DC and Sudanes media have claimed that the US vice consul was with the family at the airport. Mr Wani told AFP: 'We are worried. that;s why we want to get out of here as soon as possible.' Dr Ibrahim’s lawyer Shareif Ali Shareif told MailOnline: 'The authorities do not have the right to hold her. They appear not to want to let her leave Sudan. They are restricting her movements. 'Her husband Daniel and the children are with her in the same cell. Any reports suggesting she has been released are wrong. We need to highlight her plight.’ A diplomatic row has now erupted and the Sudanese Foreign Ministry has summoned the American and South Sudanese ambassadors to explain themselves. Dr Ibrahim had been granted emergency travel documents by the government of South Sudan to travel there and then on to the US. Menacing: . Meriam, her husband and children were detained by 40 National Security . guards on Tuesday. The Sudanese government have now banned them from . leaving the country . Mr Shareif insisted that the documents were legitimate and that it was ‘not right’ to claim otherwise. US Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) launched a blistering attack on the government of Sudan on the floor Capitol Hill today in which he said it had ‘forcibly captured’ Dr Ibrahim. Standing in front of a picture of Dr Ibrahim and her husband, he said: ‘We need to speak even louder, we need to speak out for Meriam Ibrahim because it is wrong, especially for this young mother, to be subject to torture and murder for being a Christian. ‘That is unequivocally wrong and we need to speak in one voice.’ Earlier in an interview with Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a Christian right think tank, Cruz called on President Obama to do more. He said: ‘We don’t know what their status is, we don’t know if the Sudanese government is going to reimpose the horrific sentence. It’s a powerful reminder - every one of us cherishes our religious liberty and I bet you to say that virtually none of us have had their faith tested as Meriam has had her faith tested. ‘It underscores the need for all of us to lift her up in prayer and it also underscores the need for US leadership. ‘What I have been begging for is for President Obama to stand up and lead...the President needs to say to the government of Sudan: ‘Free Meriam now’’. Cruz added: ‘Sharia law that would torture and murder a young mother for protesting her religious faith is barbaric, it is wrong and it should be condemned’ Dr Ibrahim was released from the grim Omdurman Women’s Prison on Monday after nine months in custody during which time she was sentenced to death and 100 lashes for apostasy and adultery and gave birth to Maya in her call whilst shackled to the floor. A judge had ruled that she had broken strict Islamic law by failing to renounce her Christian faith and become a Muslim. 'Barbaric': As well as the death sentence for apostasy (the crime of abandoning your religion) Ibrahim was also sentenced to 100 lashes for what the court deemed her adultery for marrying a Christian . On Monday an appeal court overturned . her conviction after an international outcry but on Tuesday she and her . family were detained again. What . happens next is unclear - Dr Ibrahim has yet to be granted asylum by . the US - but so long as she remains in Sudan her life is in danger. A . man claiming to be Dr Ibrahim’s half brother went to the prison in . Khartoum the night she was released and, upon discovering she had been . freed, flew into a rage and vowed to kill her. According to CNN, al-Samani al-Hadi, said: ‘The family is unconvinced by the court’s decision. ‘We . were not informed by the court that she was to be released; this came . as a surprise to us. The law has failed to uphold our rights. This is . now an issue of honour. The Christians have tarnished our honour, and we . will know how to avenge it.’ Speaking . to Sudanese paper, al-Samani al-Hadi, said that Meriam had been . 'kidnapped' from the family who she should have been returned to, not . her husband. 'They did not let us know that she was about to be freed. It was a surprise for us,' he said. Dr . Ibrahim was detained on Tuesday at the airport by the feared National . Intelligence and Security Services, who were dubbed ‘Agents of Fear’ in a . damning report by human rights group Amnesty. A . post on the NISS Facebook page said that its agents stopped Dr Ibrahim . because her temporary travel documents had a US visa stamp on them. The statement said: ‘This was viewed by Sudanese authorities as a criminal violation and a disregard upon which the foreign ministry summoned the US and South Sudanese envoys’. Fight for life: Mr Wani, an American citizen, has been fighting for his wife and children's release but his lawyers believe the help he has received from the US embassy has been 'shameful' The statement added that the document . was only supposed to be used for somebody travelling to their homeland . and as Dr Ibrahim would be using it to fly to America it was invalid. In . an interview with MailOnline Tina Ramirez, founder of religious freedom . organization Hardwired, which has campaigned for Dr Ibrahim to be . freed, has said that the US embassy in Sudan should have foreseen these . kind of problems. She said . that the State Department had been aware of her plight since 2011 when . she married her husband and that the handling of her case had been . ‘incredibly negligent’. Ms . Ramirez said: ‘The US government should have coordinated with the . government of Sudan to get them out of the country. This is sloppy. ‘I think that Congress should be investigating what happened here. ‘The . US says that it cares about human rights issues and this is something . they should be caring about. It’s a total failure, it’s shameful.’ State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in her Tuesday briefing that the Sudanese government had assured it of the safety of Dr Ibrahim and her family. She said the department was talking to Sudanese officials to ‘secure their safe and swift departure from Sudan’.","Meriam Ibrahim and her husband, US citizen Daniel Wani were held as they tried to fly out of the country on Tuesday .

"A ‘superwheat’ created by British scientists could increase crop yields by up to a third. In one of the biggest potential advances for farming in a generation, researchers have cross-bred modern wheat seed with ancient wild grass species to produce a more resilient, productive crop. Researchers at the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) said the new 'superwheat' could be combined with current varieties to boost drought tolerance, disease resistance, as well as their yield. Good news for farmers: A new 'superwheat' can increase wheat crop yields by up to 30 per cent (stock image pictured) In early field trials, the new crop was 30 per cent more productive than conventional wheat, and could be available to farmers as soon as 2019. The process of producing the synthetic 'superwheat' is similar to selective breeding and does not use genetic-modification. It could also spell good news for the consumer, with increased production promising to keep down prices for bread, biscuits and pasta. Britain is set to become a net importer of wheat for the first time in more than a decade after last year's terrible weather. Farmers fear the trend will continue next year, due to planting difficulties and seed shortages. Earlier this month, it emerged McVitie's Digestives will no longer carry a logo stating the biscuits contain '100 per cent British Wheat' due to sourcing difficulties. Both Hovis and Weetabix have also had to drop their sourcing pledges. Dr Tina Barsby, from the chief executive and director of NIAB, said modern cultivated wheat is the result of a cross between durum - used and goat grass that likely occurred in the Middle East 10,000 years ago. Emerging crisis: Britain faces importing wheat for the first time in more than a decade after poor weather last year destroyed crops - with farmers fearing the trend will continue next year . The Cambridge-based team selected early wheat and grass varieties from seed banks across the globe and cross-bred them for maximum potential. 'This year our crop had a 30 per cent better yields, which took us a bit by surprise,' said Dr Barsby. 'Although to is in the early stages, we are very optimistic. 'In the past decade, our wheat yield had started to plateau off and we needed another increase in productivity to meet demand. 'It is about finding novel characteristics from the original ancestors of wheat and breeding them to make them as productive and resilient as possible.' Dr Barsby said the technique involved breeding selected species of wheat and grass, and that no GM-technology was involved. 'You can sometimes become too focused on one technology like GM and not look at other techniques that can bring you similar success,' she said. Over the next 50 years, the world needs to grow more wheat than has been produced in the 10,000 years since agriculture began. NFU President, Peter Kendall, also an arable farmer, said increased production will help keep future prices down. 'The trials show up to 30 per cent yield increase, which is truly fantastic. It is particularly good news, as we had to import wheat following last year's record wet weather and it will be a similar picture this year with a poor harvest expected. 'This is about increasing resilience and making ourselves self-reliant. We want to be able to feed ourselves and the rest of the world.'","Researchers have cross-bred modern wheat seed with ancient wild grass .

"Online: Phil Culling, 41, has become romantically involved with 19-year-old Helena Skelly, who is pictured in a photo from her Twitter account . A deputy head at a leading private girls’ schools has been forced to resign because of an affair with a former pupil. Phil Culling, 41, has become romantically involved with 19-year-old Helena Skelly, an aspiring singer who left Godolphin and Latymer school last summer. Parents at the £17,000-a-year West London school received an email several days ago from headmistress Ruth Mercer, informing them Mr Culling had ‘resigned his position as deputy head with immediate effect’. Mrs Mercer confronted her deputy about the relationship after one of the teenager’s parents allegedly called the school upon discovering that the pair had moved in together. In the letter, the headmistress added: ‘We both recognised that his position had become untenable and the right thing for him to do was to leave. ‘From my point of view and that of the governors, his actions have demonstrated an unfortunate lack of judgment and a failure to uphold the responsible behaviour that we all rightly expect from our staff particularly those in leadership positions.’ Within minutes of his forced resignation, Mr Culling’s picture had been removed from the school website, and two acting deputy heads were installed  in his place. It is understood that the school decided against calling the police because staff had accepted  that the romantic side of the relationship only began once Miss Skelly had left. However, sources at the school said that it was an ‘open secret that the pair were close’. One said: ‘We all knew something was up when she was still at the school. Apparently the headmistress called the girl in to ask if anything was going on but she denied it.’ Duo: Miss Skelly is pictured performing a variety of pop songs while Mr Culling accompanies her on the piano . Prestigious: Miss Skelly left the £17,000-a-year Godolphin and Latymer school (pictured) in London last year . As well as being the deputy head, Mr Culling was head of music and spent many hours helping Miss Skelly with her goal of a career in the industry. In videos posted on YouTube, Miss Skelly is seen singing a variety of well-known pop songs while Mr Culling accompanies her on the piano. In the caption to one video, Miss Skelly says she ‘wrote this song about loving someone who you shouldn’t and just wanting things to be simpler’. In another, she sings: ‘I thought I had been in love, but that was until I met you.’ Aspiring singer: Sources at the school said it was an 'open secret' that Mr Culling and the ex-pupil were close . A source claimed that one of Miss Skelly’s parents called the school when they learned that their daughter was living with Mr Culling in the home of one of her elder sisters. Mr Culling’s estranged wife is thought to work at the school in the development department. They have three children under the age of 13. He is understood to have left their £600,000 four-bed home in Isleworth, West London, a month ago, according to neighbours. One said: ‘Philip hasn’t been around for about four weeks. I used to see him taking the kids out but not any more. And his wife has been looking very upset lately. It’s a real scandal.’ The music teacher acted as a mentor to Miss Skelly, a gifted singer, and also sat on the school’s child protection panel. Miss Skelly currently performs on the pub circuit and regularly sings at an established folk music venue in West London called the Troubadour, where Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and Joni Mitchell have all appeared in the past. Last night her father Hugh Skelly said he had no idea about his daughter’s relationship. The businessman said: ‘That’s a shock to me. I had no idea. Hel is my daughter, I know the school, she left last year. Alumnae: Godolphin and Latymer School, in Hammersmith, has around 750 pupils between  the ages of 11 and 18.

Famous alumnae include celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, Hollywood actress Kate Beckinsale, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor and TV  presenter Davina McCall. Last night a spokesman for the school said: ‘I can confirm that a teacher has resigned/left the school having failed to maintain the high standards of behaviour we expect from all staff. There is nothing further to add.’ Both Mr Culling and Miss Skelly were unavailable for comment last night.","Phil Culling, 41, has become romantically involved with Helena Skelly, 19 .

"Australians have already spent over $280 million on weight-loss products this year, with 75% of individuals admitting it is in the hope of becoming 'skinny'. But when it comes to being skinny, just how healthy is it? 1 in 4 skinny people have pre-diabetes and are 'metabolically obese', making 'Skinny Fat' one of the fastest growing medical conditions. Also termed Metabolically Obese Normal Weight (MONW) it is used to describe a person who is in an ideal weight range but has more body fat than is healthy. These people are slim, but are not fit and do not have healthy habits. Scroll down for video . People who are skinny, despite poor diets and a lack of exercise, are referred to as 'Skinny Fat' Although someone may appear healthy on the inside, they may be very unhealthy on the inside . A person's health choices should not be determined by their appearance. It is unsafe to assume that looking slim and healthy ensures a person is well . 'Most people don't realise that there can be health complications to being thin,' said Sheila Zhou, expert Scientist at USANA. 'Being 'Skinny Fat' puts your body under a huge amount of pressure, including added fat around your organs, high cholesterol, and poor blood circulation.' A lot of slim people in Australia sacrifice their health for the sake of their appearance. 'People’s intentions are often in the wrong place when they want to lose weight,' said Ms Zhou. 'Their aim is to be skinny, rather than to be healthy.' 'As a result, they have a lack of fitness and a lack of muscle mass.' Often, the problem is that a person does not eat a balanced diet or exercise because they aim to be skinny, rather than fit. The problem is also caused when a person has a fast metabolism . A person can also be skinny fat if they naturally have a fast metabolism, so do not feel the need to eat well or exercise because they are slim and appear to be healthy. 'If someone doesn’t have muscle, in the long term they are more likely to develop insulin resistance and are at risk of developing diabetes.' Startling statistics show that people with diabetes who are skinny fat have a higher mortality rate than obese diabetics. 'The problem with ‘skinny fat’ is that when people are thin, they think they are healthy and don’t realise they have a problem,' said Ms Zhou. 'Skinny fat' people need to make sure they regularly visit their doctor, particularly to check their blood sugar levels and lipid profile . 'Diabetes develops over a period of ten to thirty years, but sometimes people don’t know until they are diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes. 'It’s important they have regular check ups, particularly to check their lipid profile and blood sugar levels.' People who are skinny fat, or even people who are struggling to become healthy, are likely to be making five big mistakes. Running, artificial sweeteners and not eating carbs are three big mistakes people might be making that are making them 'fat on the inside'. 1. Put down the bubbles . It doesn't sound like much, but saying goodbye to your favourite soft drink can help rid your body of dangerous toxins. The artificial sweeteners in soft drinks mess with your body's chemicals and their processes, therefore altering your metabolism. Even diet soft drink is just as bad for your health as fried food, so there is no escape! 2. Pump more iron . As 'Skinny Fat' is essentially too much fat and not enough muscle, weight training is an effective and simple solution. Strength training causes your body to keep the lean muscle, instead of using it as fuel. Weights also activate core muscles, which help organ function. So, put your runners away and start on those reps. 3. Refuel your oil tank . Sound fishy? It's not! Even though most of us think oily foods are unhealthy, it is actually the opposite. Omega-3 fat rich foods such as salmon and sardines are delicious ways to reduce blood pressure and stabilize cholesterol. 4. Put the kettle on . Stress is one of the main causes of 'Skinny Fat', but never fear, rather than quitting your job, the solution is as simple as drinking more tea! Research shows tea heightens emotions of relaxation, and lowers our levels of cortisol after a stressful task. So swap the coffee for tea and you are already one step closer to being a picture of health! 5. Sleep away the cravings . Everyone loves sleep, but how many of us actually get the required 7 to 8 hours a night? If you ever needed an excuse, this is it. It's been scientifically proven that sleep deprivation alters your metabolism and increases cravings for carbs and sugar. So there's no need to ever feel guilt about wanting an early night; you're actually losing fat from it. 'To limit any food group or nutrients, be it carbs, fats or proteins, is bad for you,' said Ms Zhou. 'Carbohydrates should make up 50 to 65 per cent of a person’s diet, but it does vary according to a person’s activity level. 'You should not cut out carbohydrates. It's all about a balanced diet' People should be selective about the types of carbohydrates they consume instead. 'You should avoid highly processed or refined carbs like white bread or rice, and eat wholemeal, wholegrain as well as brown, red and black rice,' said Ms Zhou. It's been scientifically proven that sleep deprivation alters your metabolism and increases cravings for carbs and sugar. You will lose fat if you sleep more . Although running and other aerobic exercise is fantastic for a person's cardiovascular health, it is crucial that a person uses weights for ultimate inner health. 'However, weightlifting and weight training is really important to increase muscle mass, flexibility and the strength of the muscles,' said Ms Zhou. 'As you get older, muscle mass gradually declines, so the chance of getting diabetes will increase.' There are simple ways for a person to get their health back on track - so simple that one of the best methods is sleep. 'A lack of sleep stimulates the production of a stress hormone called cortisol., . Cortisol causes issues like overeating, increased abdominal fat and decreased muscle tissue. According to studies, people who lack sleep tend to put on weight more than people with normal sleep patterns and crave carbs, sugar and unhealthy foods.' And good news for coffee lovers! Ms Zhou says coffee has been prove to have health benefits. 'Coffee does provide a certain health benefit in moderation. 'Studies have shown that it can be good for cardiovascular health, oxidants, and some suggest help improve cognitive function.' Although walking, running, swimming and other aerobic exercises are great for your cardiovascular health, it is crucial that a person also does weights and strength work for their health .","'Skinny Fat' describes a person who may appear skinny but is unhealthy .

"North Korea has threatened a fresh atom bomb test in response to a UN resolution on its human rights violations. New satellite imagery reportedly shows steam rising from the North's Yongbyon plutonium reprocessing complex, a sign experts say consistent with it gearing up to resume operations. Pyongyang's foreign ministry today called the UN's new resolution 'a grave political provocation', and accused the U.S. of orchestrating the measures drafted by Japanese and EU diplomats. North Koreans wave flags as they walk with statues of former leaders Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il during a parade past Kim Il-Sung square marking the 60th anniversary of the Korean war armistice in Pyongyang . The resolution, adopted by a UN committee on Tuesday, urges the Security Council to refer the North's rights situation to the International Criminal Court. It's the first time a UN resolution included the idea that the North's absolute leader Kim Jong Un could be targeted by prosecutors. Before the UN vote, a North Korean envoy threatened a nuclear test and today that threat was repeated by an unidentified foreign ministry spokesman in North Korean state media. He said war deterrence will be strengthened in an 'unlimited manner' to cope with U.S. hostility, which is 'compelling us not to refrain from conducting a new nuclear test any longer.' The U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies said Wednesday the North may be restarting a plant that can reprocess nuclear fuel into weapons-grade plutonium for the first time in six years. The finding is based on analysis of recent commercial satellite imagery at the North's main nuclear facility. North Korea conducted an atomic bomb test in 2006, 2009 and 2013, each time inviting international sanctions. A fourth test would mark another defiant response to international pressure, because that could put the country a step closer to the goal of producing warheads small enough to mount on a missile. New satellite imagery reportedly shows steam rising from the North's Yongbyon plutonium reprocessing complex, shown on this map, a sign experts say consistent with it gearing up to resume operations . Today Russia shrugged off the reports of North Korea gearing up for fresh nuclear tests. 'Right now a lot of statements are appearing that some preparations are underway for new tests or the resumption or ramping up of activity in the nuclear and rocket spheres,' said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. 'First of all, it is best to put forward such statements when they are based on facts -- not through the media,' Lavrov told reporters after talks with a special envoy of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. 'This is why we propose that the activities of a working group on peace and security on the Korean peninsula be resumed,' Lavrov said after talks with Choe Ryong-Hae. Such work, Russia's top diplomat said, would allow the parties to address all concerns 'without politicisation.' 'We are hoping that our partners will support our proposals to resume the work of the group.' Choe did not address the media. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un visits the February 20 Factory of the Korean People's Army which produces foodstuff for servicemen in North Korea on November 15, 2014 . Russia, the U.S., China, South Korea and Japan have for years sought to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme in exchange for aid and security guarantees. The negotiations known as six-party talks began in 2003 but have been long dormant. Lavrov slammed as 'counter-productive' the UN resolution that lays the groundwork for putting the Stalinist regime in the dock for crimes against humanity. Choe, who is on a week-long visit to Russia, was received by President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Tuesday.","New UN resolution 'a grave political provocation' says NK foreign ministry .

"Even Basil Fawlty, at the end of his tether, would never have come up with something quite as idiotic as the customer relations policy of Blackpool’s Broadway Hotel. Confronted with a string of complaints on customer ratings website TripAdvisor from a recent guest, the management could have a) offered an apology, b) offered a refund or c) offered a defence. Instead, they had a better idea. They fined the unhappy customer £100. In doing so, they have made headlines everywhere from New York to Melbourne, reheated a thousand unkind jokes about Blackpool and ensured that millions of people around the world have now read some of the most excoriating travel reviews this side of North Korea. Scroll down for video . Not even Basil Fawlty would come up with something as idiotic as the customer relations policy as this hotel . The Broadway Hotel in Blackpool, pictured, made headlines across the globe from New York to Melbourne . Guests on TripAdvisor posted a string of unflattering photographs of the hotel on its website . Visitors to the hotel are treated to peeling wallpaper in the rather small  bathroom,  pictured . ‘This place needs closing down,’ says one of this month’s latest crop of stinkers, under the heading ‘Pure Filth Avoid’. ‘Staff drinking cans of Strongbow while serving breakfast,’ the reviews continued. ‘Could not wait to get out of this place and get home to bath. ’ Another review, by Tracy W of Derby, states: ‘There was a pair of socks left in the draws [sic] that had actually grown mould on them.’ A photograph of the offending socks is attached for the world to see. Indeed, the review which has now made the Broadway an international laughing stock is not even the worst. ‘Filthy, Dirty Rotten Stinking Hovel Run By Muppets!’ begins a detailed critique by Tony Jenkinson, of Whitehaven in Cumbria, who concludes: ‘STAY AWAY!!!!’ But it was his observations, posted on TripAdvisor at the end of August, which resulted in the subsequent £100 penalty by the Broadway management. They simply deducted it from the debit card he had used to settle his bill. The Broadway Hotel proudly shows its fading award for 2004 Blackpool Tourism hotel of the year, pictured . One review stated that the socks left behind in a drawer had actually 'grown mould on them', pictured . For £35, a guest can stay in a double room, with clean sheets, hot water, free WiFI and full English breakfast . So here I am checking in to a hotel which, by the sound of it, could not only damage my health but my bank balance, too. Intriguingly, it’s by no means the worst hotel in Blackpool (in the TripAdvisor rankings it is a mere 858 out of 894). What’s more, this is actually the ‘award-winning’ Broadway Hotel, having been garlanded with Blackpool’s Hotel of the Year Award as recently as 2005. And the verdict? While I have stayed in better, I have definitely stayed in a lot worse. The faded décor can’t have changed much since Ken Dodd cracked his first gag at the end of the pier. My sea view is obscured by what first appears to be frosted glass and then turns out to be a patina of grime. There is no shampoo, let alone soap in my bathroom. On the other hand, the sheets are clean, the water is hot, WiFi is free and the service is attentive. And at £35 for a double room including a full English breakfast — less than the cost of a day’s parking in London — it’s certainly competitive. Another reviewer posted a photograph of an unappealing-looking mattress on Tripadvisor . Another reviewer found an area where a ceiling tile had been removed leaving an unattractive gap in the roof . One review claimed that staff at the hotel, pictured, were drinking cans of Strongbow while serving breakfast . So why has this place become so unpopular? And will anyone ever stay here again? The gloss of that 2005 ‘Hotel of the Year Award’ did not last for long. The following year, the first bad review popped up on TripAdvisor. ‘The staff were so unfriendly,’ wrote one Broadway guest. ‘The food was horrible, a resident on another table asked for a jug of water, when this arrived it had slithers of glass in it.’ The attacks kept on coming. Lots of hotels have suffered abuse from TripAdvisor’s legion of anonymous reviewers. But the Broadway has attracted more than most. Perhaps the reason Mr Jenkinson was fined for his harsh words was that he was easily identifiable, having signed his review ‘Tony J of Whitehaven’. The hotel claimed it was justified in penalising him because the small print on his booking form had stated: ‘For every bad review left on any website, the group organiser will be charged a maximum £100 per review.’ Guests are treated to a towel fashioned into the shape of a swan - something not on offer at the Savoy . The fraying decor cannot have changed much since Ken Dodd cracked his first joke in Blackpool . Mr Jenkinson complained to his local Trading Standards officer, who reported the matter to Blackpool Council. A council spokesman tells me that an officer contacted the Broadway last week and explained that charging unhappy customers was not merely ‘bad practice’ but probably illegal. The hotel responded by agreeing not to issue any further fines. But it was only after this week’s avalanche of international condemnation that it finally expressed some sort of contrition and issued a prepared statement. While not apologising, it promised to refund the Jenkinsons’ money, adding: ‘We agree there is room for improvement at our establishment and we desperately want to turn things around.’ Clearly, it is a cornerstone of our democracy that people should be free to say what they like, subject to the laws of libel and incitement. The Broadway has behaved like some thin-skinned despot. On the other hand, many hotels have reported customers demanding cheap deals on pain of a gratuitously aggressive online review. And every hotelier will have stories of the ‘guests from hell’. The publicity could hardly have come at a worse time since the hotel is also up for sale. According to the agents, £375,000 will buy you 46 bedrooms, a ‘Mediterranean-themed dining room’, sun lounge and a business with a turnover of £120,000. Food was not on offer off-season but guests are encouraged to bring back takeaways and watch TV in the bar . A prior guest appears to have had an accident with an iron while preparing for a night out in Blackpool . Guests have the option of using an old-fashioned CRT television in their bedrooms at the hotel . But since neither the owners nor the management will discuss the matter any further, the only option is to book a room and see for myself. The Broadway is just a short walk from the rollercoasters of Blackpool Pleasure Beach. Just over the road, the Silver Sands Hotel is festooned with Christmas decorations and echoing to the sound of a coach party singing along to the resident crooner’s Neil Diamond repertoire. The scene is less jolly at the Broadway. Despite its transatlantic aspirations, the New York theme does not seem to extend beyond the Fred Astaire cut-out above the door. There is, as yet, no sign of Christmas, although a leaflet promises a ‘tinsel and turkey’ package in the near future. But there is a friendly welcome at reception where a young man introduces himself as Ryan, hands me a key and says I need only ask if I need anything. Rooms must be paid for up front but the booking form doesn’t mention anything about a fine. Visitors can take part in the Friday night Karaoke competition where six shots of Sambuca cost £10 . The Broadway hotel is currently up for sale for £375,000 with an annual turnover of £125,000 . My first-floor room is just big enough for a double bed. There are a couple of rustic prints hanging from peeling peach wallpaper. The bathroom seems clean enough. Indeed, there is a novel touch of sophistication with the towels. One of them has been folded in to the shape of a swan and is sitting on the bed. You don’t get that at the Savoy. Down in the near-empty bar, there are posters for a Friday night karaoke competition, along with a special Sambuca offer — six shots for a tenner. The only entertainment tonight, however, is a television tuned in to the BBC News channel. There’s no evening food out of season but guests are welcome to bring back takeaways. I join three other people watching the news in silence. At least two are obviously undercover journalists, while the third is either a travelling salesman or a good actor. I sleep well enough but this is no place for early birds as the dining room doesn’t open until 8.30am. The full English breakfast is average, edible and no different to the sort of thing you might get at a motorway stop. A middle-aged couple arrive and cannot speak a single word of English. Then the woman has a brainwave, produces an iPad and contacts an English-speaking relative via Skype. The relative then shouts back the couple’s breakfast order to Ryan. Before I leave I come clean and ask Ryan what the last few days have been like. After all, my experience is certainly different to that of many TripAdvisor correspondents. He says that he is under orders not to comment but insists that the hotel has not undergone any sudden transformation. The Broadway now has more than its online critics to worry about. The whole town is furious. Having enjoyed a bumper summer, with overnight stays up by 30 per cent, Blackpool tourism chiefs are dismayed by all the negative publicity, as yesterday’s edition of the Blackpool Gazette made clear. But perhaps, in some strange way, this episode may actually turn around the hotel’s flagging fortunes. People may not only discover that there is a bargain to be had — but there is also the novelty value of staying in a hotel famous for making Fawlty Towers look like the Ritz. And the Broadway is surely a contender for one more award — the public relations disaster of the decade.","Rooms at the Broadway Hotel in Blackpoool are available for £35-a-night .

"Warning: Nigel Farage, who stands by comments he made to Right-wing U.S. radio host Alex Jones that EU leaders could be overthrown in a 'revolution' Nigel Farage was at the centre of a row last night after appearing to suggest ‘violence’ could be justified to overthrow Brussels bureaucrats. The Ukip leader warned that the EU was heading for ‘revolution’ and said violent protest could be the only way for southern European nations to save their democracies. He also compared ‘emergency powers’ adopted by EU leaders during the euro crisis to Adolf Hitler’s suspension of democracy in 1930s Germany. His remarks came in interviews with controversial US Right-wing radio host Alex Jones. They were broadcast last year and little-noticed at the time but are still available online. Speaking against the backdrop of massive public protests in Greece over being forced by Brussels to implement huge spending cuts, Mr Farage said the way southern European nations were ordered around was ‘a recipe for revolution’. He added: ‘I see the suffering of people in the Mediterranean reaching a real crisis point and I think the danger that Southern Europe faces is there could be a spark and that spark could lead  to something akin to violent revolution. 'The whip hand is now so firmly with the bureaucrats – they hold all the cards – that possibly violence is the only way out of this.’ Last night, Mr Farage stood by his remarks and denied they were inflammatory. He said the ‘last thing’ he wanted was people resorting to violence but insisted: ‘As far as the Mediterranean is concerned, I think it will be a violent end.’ Pro-European Tory MP Robert Buckland condemned Mr Farage’s remarks as ‘completely unacceptable’. Inflammatory: The Ukip leader predicted a 'violent end' in parts of the Mediterranean such as Athens .","Ukip leader says suffering in Mediterranean had reached 'crisis point'

"With phone handsets constantly evolving and the need for connectivity increasing, it can be difficult to make an informed decision as to which mobile to choose for your lifestyle. Phone handsets can also be expensive, both to buy outright, or over a provider's phone plan, which might be convenient, but could see you forking out more than the retail price. With the 5.5 inch 16GB Apple iPhone 6 retailing from $999 and the 5.1 inch  16GB Samsung Galaxy S5 retailing from $778, it comes as a surprise that a new handset is breaking into the smartphone market retailing for only $99. Scroll down for video . The Boost View 5.0 is targeted at a younger demographic who are conscious of finances but want the best possible phone on which to take photos and engage on social media . Marketing itself as the first 5 inch handset for under $100, the brand new Boost Mobile Alcatel One Touch View 5.0 is set to hit the market this week, and Daily Mail Australia set out to compare how the budget phone compares to the much more expensive handsets. The Boost View 5.0 is targeted at a younger demographic who are conscious of finances but want the best possible phone on which to take photos and engage on social media. 'However, consumers are fed up of being charged significantly more to purchase them than in other countries. We want to offer people a top spec phone, perfect for social media sharing, at an affordable price,' Mr Blackhall said. Daily Mail Australia spoke to Stephen Fenech, editor of Tech Guide, to see how the Alcatel One Touch stacked up against it's Apple and Samsung counterparts. ‘Australians love smartphones, usage figures are amongst the highest in the world per capita and we spend around 2 hours on them each day,' said Ian Blackhall, Chief Marketing Officer of Boost Mobile . 'The iPhone and Samsung products are far more expensive because they have brighter, larger and much higher resolution screens along with processors that are twice as fast and superior cameras plus they offer top shelf features like fingerprint recognition and productivity features like multitasking,' Stephen said . 'Comparing the $99 Alcatel OneTouch phone to the iPhone and Samsung is like comparing a Hyundai to a Ferrari - they both do kind of the same thing but the Ferrari has a much nicer design, is faster, sleeker and all the bells and whistles,' Stephen said. The tech expert said that the Alcatel One Touch has lower specifications than the iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy S, with 4GB of internal storage, 5 megapixel camera, a 5-inch screen with a resolution of 854 x 480 and a 1.3Ghz quad core processor. 'These customers can’t afford the iPhone or top-of-the-line Samsungs, as usually younger users who are buying their first smartphone. However, the phone still offers value to pre-paid customers,' Stephen said. The Boost Mobile Alcatel One Touch is available on the Telstra 3G Mobile Network with Boost’s $40 Unlimited monthly offer, and most phone networks offer bring-your-own handset deals. Telstra offers a Mobile Accelerate Plan BYO $45 per month for other handsets, Optus offers a comparable $35 BYO plan, and Vodafone offers a $30 BYO plan. 'Comparing the $99 Alcatel OneTouch phone to the iPhone and Samsung is like comparing a Hyundai to a Ferrari - they both do kind of the same thing but the Ferrari has a much nicer design, is faster, sleeker and all the bells and whistles,' said Stephen . 'The iPhone and Samsung products are far more expensive because they have brighter, larger and much higher resolution screens along with processors that are twice as fast and superior cameras (iPhone 6 has an eight megapixel - and Samsung Galaxy S5 has a 16 megapixel camera) plus they offer top shelf features like fingerprint recognition and productivity features like multitasking. In the case of the Samsung Galaxy S5 it is also waterproof!' Stephen said. These pointers don't mean that the $99 smartphone isn't great value, however. Stephen labelled the One Touch 'excellent value', as it still offers the experience most users are looking for, as they can enjoy content on the go on the larger 5-inch screen, connect to social media and take pictures with the built-in camera. 'No it’s not an iPhone or Samsung phone but the Boost Mobile $99 phone still punches well above its weight,' Stephen determined.","Boost Mobile have launched the first $99 smartphone aimed at young social media users .

"Air conditioning hasn't changed much over the past century - most options are energy hungry and many are noisy and pretty unsightly. But one company has taken inspiration from nature to create an innovative alternative that doesn't require electricity and in theory isn't even visible. Using a substance called hydrogel, experts have created walls that absorb moisture to ‘sweat’ - like human skin - and cool the interior of a building. Architects in Barcelona have invented a new type of air conditioning. A substance called hydrogel that could be used in walls (shown) and can absorb water and then 'sweat' The technique was developed by architects from the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia in Barcelona. Hydrogel is useful because it can swell to 500 times its size and absorb water. The unprecedented drought afflicting California is 'very likely' linked to human-caused climate change, researchers at National Climactic Data Center found. They say a persistent region of high atmospheric pressure hovering over the Pacific Ocean that diverted storms away from California was much more likely to form in the presence of modern greenhouse gas concentrations. It is one of the most comprehensive studies to investigate the link between climate change and California's ongoing drought. The report found that high-pressure ridges like the one that stubbornly parked itself over the Pacific Ocean for the past two winters, blocking storms from hitting California, are much more likely to form in the presence of man-made greenhouse gases. The ridge, dubbed the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge by researchers, or 'Triple R,' parched the state during the past two rainy seasons. When air around it heats up, this water evaporates and the air around the gel can be cooled by 5 or 6°C. This means it has a sort of ‘embedded intelligence’ according to the team, as it will only begin cooling its surroundings when the temperature outside is hot. ‘In other words, when it is hotter outside, the interior responds by naturally decreasing its temperature,' the team writes. 'Meanwhile, when evaporation isn’t occurring, the system doesn’t cool the enclosed space.’ Placing bubbles of the gel between two ceramic layers allows the innovative technology to then be used in walls. And as the hydrogels are simply little balls, the system can be moulded to fit a variety of structures. However, it’s likely this technology would need to be used in tandem with existing air conditioning units to ensure a building reached a comfortable temperature. According to the team this could cut power usage in a home by 28 per cent, while carbon emissions could be cut by 124.6lbs (56.5kg). Hydrogel (shown) is useful because it can swell to 500 times its size and absorb water. When water evaporates from the substance it cools its surroundings . Hydrogel can be used to reduce temperature by five to six degrees. It could reduce our dependence on energy-hungry air conditioning units. Placing bubbles of the gel between two ceramic layers (shown) allows the innovative technology to then be used in walls .","Architects in Barcelona have invented a new type of air conditioning .

"A woman who called Aboriginal people 'wasters' says she will be using her experience of visiting remote indigenous communities to help her through her marriage breakdown. Bo-dene Stieler, from Melbourne, appeared in SBS series First Contact that saw six 'ordinary' Australians immerse themselves in Aboriginal communities to try to challenge their prejudices about the indigenous population. At the beginning of the three-part series, Ms Stieler did not have a positive opinion of Australia's first inhabitants. Scroll down for video . At the beginning of the three-part series, Bo-dene Stieler labelled Aboriginal people as 'wasters' 'When I think of Aboriginal people, I think of ""wasters"",' she said initially. But when Ms Stieler came back from her three-week trip to the Northern Territory and Western Australia not only had her views changed, but so had her home life. When she arrived home she found out her husband of three years had moved out. Ms Stieler said she felt her world had fallen apart and felt humiliated by the marriage break-up. Ms Stieler appeared in the SBS series, First Contact, where six 'ordinary' Australians immerse themselves in Aboriginal communities to try to challenge their prejudices about the indigenous population . On Thursday's episode, she does a complete 360 on her views, saying she was 'ashamed' of what she thought about indigenous Australians . But without her experience through First Contact, the Melbourne woman did not think she would have found the strength to go on. 'If I hadn't done the trip, I know that I would not have been able to handle the prospects of being alone,' she wrote. 'I had to be brave and draw inspiration from the amazing women I had met, especially June Oscar in Fitzroy Crossing, to not surrender to adversity.' During Thursday's episode of First Contact, the group travelled to Roebourne Prison where 90 per cent of inmates were indigenous and to Fitzroy Crossing - a community that fought to ban full-strength alcohol to reduce violence in the community. In an article she wrote for SBS, Ms Stieler reveals she came home to find out her husband of three years had left her, but due to her experiences on the show she thinks she can build a new life again . Having had these experiences, Ms Stieler said she now felt 'ashamed' about what she had thought about indigenous Australians. 'Before the journey, I would never have thought that my biggest life inspiration would come from Aboriginal people,' she said. 'Looking back, I can't believe the ignorance I showed and the disrespect I showed by not even taking the pro-active approach to find out more and just believing everything that I had been told.' Thursday's episode of First Contact was less controversial than Wednesday's, where one participant, Sandy, lied to producers about getting her nails done before escaping on a flight back to Sydney. The mother-of-five, 41, is of Syrian, German and Caucasian descent, and the father of her children is Maori. On the show, she claimed Aboriginals had 'whinged too much' about the stolen generation of children snatched from their parents to be brought up in white society.","Bo-dene Stieler, from Melbourne, features in the SBS series, First Contact .

"Scores of retired police officers are facing an investigation into their conduct at a notorious flashpoint during the miners’ strike in the 1980s. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has spent more than a year carrying out a preliminary probe into the infamous ‘Battle of Orgreave,’ one of the ugliest confrontations during the bitter dispute. Last night police reacted furiously as speculation grew that the watchdog could soon announce a full-scale investigation – similar to the Hillsborough Inquiry – into claims police made up statements about Orgreave. Flashpoint: A mounted policeman swings his baton during the clash with miners at Orgreave . Nearly 100 miners were charged with rioting, unlawful assembly and related offences after clashing with police at the Orgreave coking plant near Rotherham in the summer of 1984. The confrontation took place between 10,000 strikers and 5,000 police officers. However, the prosecution of all 95 miners who were charged over the incident collapsed the following year after concerns emerged about police statements. Lawsuits were brought against the police for assault, unlawful arrest and malicious prosecution and South Yorkshire Police later agreed to pay nearly £500,000 in compensation to 39 miners. The row over what did or did not happen at Orgreave was back in the spotlight yesterday after Labour demanded that David Cameron issue a formal apology for Margaret Thatcher’s handling of the miners’ strike in 1984 and 1985. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher, MP for the former pit town of Barnsley, also called for a ‘proper investigation’ into alleged police malpractice at Orgreave on June 18 1984. His comments piled pressure on the IPCC, which since November 2012 has been carrying out a comprehensive review of the case. Two former senior officers who helped police the miners’ strike urged the IPCC not to ‘waste money’ investigating events three decades ago. Campaign: Labour want to make David Cameron issue a formal public apology for Margaret Thatcher's handling of the miners' strike in the 1980s . Former chief superintendent Simon Humphrey said: ‘The idea of a new investigation being launched into Orgreave is unbelievable. Absolute cobblers. ‘People are too quick to forget that police were up against extremely violent flying pickets who were breaking the law, preventing people who wanted to go to work from going to work.’ And Dai Davies, another former  chief superintendent, also condemned the prospect of a multi-million-pound inquiry. He said: ‘Officers were pelted with bricks and stones, and showed the utmost restraint. I would much rather scant police resources are devoted to tackling today’s crimes – in particular child sex abuse – than events 30 years ago. 'If anyone should apologise, it is the Labour politicians who aided, abetted and encouraged violence at the time.’ Confrontation: Police grapple with those on the picket line at Orgreave . The IPCC preliminary inquiry into Orgreave was launched nearly 15 months ago after claims in a BBC documentary that some officers may have colluded in writing court statements. Television footage and photographs had shown miners being beaten with truncheons by police, some in riot gear and some on horses, who claimed they were attacked first by the miners picketing the plant. Yesterday the IPCC said it hoped to decide whether it will carry out a full-scale probe into Orgreave before the 30th anniversary in June. It said it had asked all police forces in England and Wales to search their archives for any documents relating to the confrontation. ‘This search for additional information forms part of the IPCC’s ongoing scoping exercise to assist in identifying matters arising from the events at Orgreave which remain capable of investigation,’ it said. Speaking in November, IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts said: ‘I appreciate it is now almost 30 years since the events at Orgreave and a year since South Yorkshire Police made a referral to us – and people will rightly want answers to the questions they have.’ She added: ‘The amount of documentation that we have to analyse is potentially vast.’ Former NUM leader Arthur Scargill, 76, who lives in Central London, slammed down the phone when the Mail rang him for a comment.","Retired police face investigation into conduct during miners’ strike in 80s .

"A puppy breeder arrested on suspicion of murdering a mother and daughter and executing four dogs had his shotguns seized last year only for them to be handed back by police, it was revealed today. Surrey Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission after it emerged they took John Lowe's weapons in May 2013 but returned them in July. On Sunday morning armed officers called to reports of gunfire were confronted by sickening scenes, with . the bodies of Christine Lee, 66, . her daughter Lucy, 40, and four animals strewn around his squalid six acre farm in Farnham, Surrey. Bereft Stacy Banner, 38, has said her whole . family has been 'wiped out' as detectives continued to question 82-year-old Lowe about the bloodshed. Her mother Christine was found dead inside the dilapidated farmhouse, while . her sister Lucy, 40, had been shot dead outside in a muddy yard as she . apparently tried to flee the gunman. Bereft: Stacy Banner, left, says her whole family has been wiped out after her mother and sister were shot dead on a puppy farm. Police are interviewing her step-father John Lowe, 82, right, on suspicion of murder . The women's bodies bodies were discovered by police responding to reports of gunfire at his isolated home . Detectives from Surrey Police are today investigating whether one of the guns recovered at the scene was one they returned to Mr Lowe last summer. Surrey Police had had previous contact with parties involved in this incident and has referred a past contact to the IPCC,' a spokesman said. 'In May 2013 a shotgun licence and a number of licensed shotguns were seized from the address however the licence and guns were returned in July 2013. 'We are in the process of establishing if one of these licensed guns was the firearm recovered on Sunday'. Under Home Office guidelines weapons can be seized for a nu,ber of reasons, including if the licence-holder has made a threat of violence. An IPCC spokesman told MailOnline: 'We have received a referral from Surrey Police and are considering what our involvement should be.' A source said that a dsecision on whether an investigation will be launched could happen by the end of today. Both the dead women had been shot with a long-barrelled shotgun and were pronounced dead at the scene. Surrey Police has confirmed the identities of Christine and Lucy Lee and said post-mortem examinations showed they died from gunshot wounds. 'I have lost everyone - . my mum, sister and dad. Now it seems he's wiped out my entire family. This is a nightmare,' Stacy Banner told The Sun. 'I just can't get my head around what's happened. My family's gone and I'm absolutely devastated. 'I'm utterly heartbroken - we've been left in pieces. 'I just want to wake up and be told it's a dream. My mum and sister must have been so scared.' Lowe's suspected breeding practices have been part of BBC Inside Out documentaries. The first was shot in 2004 . Scene: Police called to a house outside Farnham, Surrey, found the bodies of two women and four dogs . A marked police van guarded the gates at the end of the drive of the detached house when they were called . Animal welfare officers removed this dog from the isolated puppy farm this afternoon. Four were already dead . Police and animal welfare officers coaxed an Old English sheepdog still left at the property into a crate . Neighbours said puppy breeder John Lowe, 82, has lived at Keeper's Cottage for more than 30 years . Forensics experts were called to the house - yesterday neighbours raised the alarm after hearing gunshots . Aerial shot: Mr Lowe's brick and flint farmhouse is surrounded by ramshackle outbuildings and sheds . A . few yards away from the bodies, in a filthy kennel, police found a German shepherd that . had been shot dead, while two other German shepherds and a labrador were . also found dead nearby. Pensioner Mr Lowe was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder. Animal . welfare officers were called to rescue animals living in appalling . squalor at the property, Keeper’s Cottage Stud, after Sunday’s shooting. In . all, 14 dogs were taken away, including nine kept in filthy, crumbling, . outdoor pens. Six horses were also found at the property where Mr Lowe . lived alone following his partner’s death last year. Two in extremely poor condition were rescued from a yard covered in pools of liquid manure and strewn with rotting hay. The other four emaciated animals remained in a stable with its roof hanging off. They were caked in mud. Among scrap metal and tumble-down outbuildings, a dovecote could be seen where Mr Lowe is said to have kept birds. It emerged that officials had regularly visited Keeper’s Cottage Stud over concerns at the conditions in which animals lived. Surrey Police and the RSPCA were called in last July over concerns about breeding at the farm, when 50 dogs were found. RSPCA . Inspector Rob Jackson said last night: ‘I came to Mr Lowe’s property . about six months ago responding to a complaint about the welfare of dogs . at the farm. ‘I will not . discuss that visit but previously he has bred a number of different . breeds – beagles, labradoodles and German shepherds.’ An online petition set up last year calling on the RSPCA to close the puppy farm attracted 1,300 signatures. Police remove the body of a dog from the scene where two women and four dogs were shot dead yesterday . Police vans, RSPCA vans, and vehicles belonging to forensics teams were parked outside the farm this afternoon . A forensics officer works in one of several outbuildings at the property down a track outside Farnham, Surrey . Mr . Lowe denied wrongdoing at the time saying: ‘There are no puppies here. The only dogs here are my four guard dogs. I have never heard of this . petition and the things said on it are absolute rubbish.’ In . 2009 he had been convicted at Guildford Crown Court of illegal dog . breeding, when Recorder Joseph Boothby told him: ‘It is clear that you . are a stubborn old man and you refuse to give up your old ways.’ He was . fined £2,000 and banned from breeding dogs for five years. In . 2004, Mr Lowe was also the subject of an investigation by BBC’s Inside . Out programme, which claimed he was breeding and selling puppies in poor . condition. Some were said to have died soon after being bought. Mr . Lowe bought Keeper’s Cottage Stud in 1966. It has since fallen into a . state of disrepair, but the plot alone would be worth several  million . pounds. A spokesman for the RSPCA said there were 'quite a large number' of dogs and horses still left at the property . The property is surrounded by fields and woodland, while what appears to be an outdoor kennel is near the house . Police were called to the house in a rural area outside Farnham, Surrey, shortly before 10am yesterday . Neighbours described . the suspect as a recluse. ‘The RSPCA was always up there and no sooner . had they shut him down than he would spring back into business. They . just couldn’t stop him,’ said one man, who declined to be named. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Preston said the suspect was uninjured and remained calm when officers attended the house. Last . night police had yet to formally identify the victims. ‘The parties . involved are all believed to be known to each other and police are not . looking for anyone else in connection with the incident,’ said a . spokesman. It was unclear . whether Mr Lowe had a licence for the firearm found at the property. As . the suspect was known to police the case has been referred to the . Independent Police Complaints Commission. An RSPCA spokesman said it was working with the police ‘as there are quite a large number of dogs and horses at the property’. Murder scene: Forensics officers remove bags of evidence from the scene this afternoon . A private ambulance removed one of the victim's bodies from the farm this afternoon . With its smart brick and flint gateposts and elegant slate sign, there is little to indicate the squalor of John Lowe's Keeper's Cottage Stud. But it has been the subject of repeated investigations by animal welfare agencies, and as recently as last summer, more than 1,300 angry people signed an online petition calling for the animal to be closed down. In 2008, journalists . working on a BBC investigation into conditions at his animal farm . interviewed customers who said they had bought dogs from Mr Lowe without knowing they were seriously ill. A smart slate sign with gold lettering is inlaid into the gates to the squalid animal farm where the women died . One customer who bought a beagle puppy from him said the dog fell ill within an hour of them getting home and died within days. She said: 'The farm was filthy but we were desperate to buy one.  We were silly - we bought it on the spur of the moment. 'We thought we could take her away from there and give her a better life, but that didn't happen.' Another . customer had to have his beagle puppy put down after it, too, became . seriously ill soon after it was bought from Mr Lowe. In 2009 Mr Lowe was convicted of . illegal dog breeding and described by a judge as a 'stubborn old man' who 'refused to give up his old ways'. He . was fined £2,000 and banned from breeding dogs for five years by . magistrates and the sentence was upheld by a judge at Guildford Crown . Court when Mr Lowe appealed against the conviction.

"Cheryl Cole last night denied using an Irish company to help avoid paying up to £200,000 in UK tax. The singer’s spokesman claimed she had created Tara Entertainment Ltd to deal with her international earnings simply because her accountant is Irish rather than as a way of paying a lower rate of company tax. Tara, which was set up in 2001, and its British-based parent company CC Entertainment International, were put into voluntary liquidation in the last two months, prompting speculation the star is keen to avoid accusations she is dodging UK tax. Cheryl Cole (in between Mel B and Simon Cowell) was introduced to the accountant Alan McEvoy by her former manager Louis Walsh (left) However last night Cole’s publicist Sundraj Sreenivasan insisted the change in her financial arrangements was because her accountant Alan McEvoy had moved to London. Mr Sreenivasan added that the star had been introduced to Mr McEvoy by Girls Aloud former manager Irish impresario Louis Walsh. In a statement he said: ‘Cheryl has used the same accountant in Ireland for 13 years. The accountant was recommended by Louis Walsh, who at the time managed her as part of Girls Aloud. Her accountant has recently set up an office in London so Cheryl’s Irish company has been dissolved.’ The change in Cole’s tax affairs came just days before George Michael, Gary Barlow and dozens of other celebrities learned they are liable for millions in unpaid taxes after HMRC ruled an investment vehicle they had used was a tax avoidance scam. While Cole’s actions are legal, the last accounts for Tara showed assets of £2.5 million at the end of 2012, suggesting the star had funnelled at least this much through the company. Girls Aloud: Sarah Harding, Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Cole and Kimberley Walsh . If this was the case the singer would have avoided paying £200,000 in tax that would have been owed in Britain. This is the difference between Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate compared to the 21 per cent rate in the UK. Documents for the liquidation of the company, CC Entertainment – which in 2013 declared only £1 in net assets – now show it has £1.88 million funds, which is likely to be paid to Cole as the company’s sole owner. She has married her French lover Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, 33, after a whirlwind three-month romance.","Cole created Tara Entertainment Ltd to deal with her international earnings .

"Millions of British households will have to retune their TV sets following plans to sell off broadcasting frequencies used by Freeview (file picture) Millions of households will have to retune their TV sets and up to 300,000 will need to move their aerial or install a new one following a decision to sell off the broadcasting frequencies used by Freeview. Regulator Ofcom yesterday announced the decision, which will create space on the nation’s airwaves to expand high-speed mobile phone services. It is predicted the move will cost viewers up to £16million and affect up to 20million homes. The retuning will start in 2019 – possibly earlier. Meanwhile the companies that run the network of masts could face a bill of £470million to install equipment needed to cope with the change. This could be at least partly funded through the BBC TV licence fee. The radical overhaul has been challenged by a company called Digital UK. The firm, which is owned by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Arqiva – who own and operate the transmitter network – warned that the move will be expensive and disruptive for viewers. The decision by Ofcom will allow the Government to sell the highly lucrative 700 megahertz transmission band to mobile phone networks offering high speed 4G services, potentially raising billions of pounds for the Treasury. Announcing the proposals, Ofcom said they will greatly improve signals used by mobile phones and boost the economy. It added: ‘Demand for mobile data could be 45 times higher by 2030 than it is today.’ Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards said: ‘This is a crucial next step in the development of the UK’s communications infrastructure. ‘More spectrum will be available for mobile broadband where demand is especially high, but the UK will retain a competitive terrestrial television platform as well.’ But the impact on viewers, digital terrestrial television (DTT) and the Freeview channels broadcast through masts and aerials was buried in the detail of the report. This states: ‘We estimate that 14million to 20million households will need to retune. For the vast majority of viewers the proposed replan will only involve a simple retuning of their TVs or set-top boxes. For up to 0.5 per cent of households using DTT, it will also involve replacing their rooftop aerial.’ Ofcom estimates up to 190,000 will need to move their aerial, while another 110,000 will need to buy a new one, at an average cost of £150 a time. The regulator estimates the overall cost to consumers will be £10million to £16million. Ofcom estimates up to 190,000 will need to move their aerial, while another 110,000 will need to buy a new one, at an average cost of £150 a time. The regulator estimates the overall cost  will be £10million to £16million . Digital UK said: ‘Neither broadcasters nor viewers should bear the cost of any transition and terrestrial television must be assured continued access to alternative airwaves for the long term.’ Telecoms expert Dominic Baliszewski, of broadbandchoices.co.uk, said the changes are good news for mobile users, particularly in rural areas. He said: ‘The decision to free up more frequencies for mobile broadband is a bit like opening a new lane on a busy motorway for certain types of traffic – this will mean more capacity and better speeds. ‘The 700Mhz band is better at passing through walls and can travel further than other frequencies. The means that people in rural areas, or other areas with historically poor coverage, might stand to benefit the most.’","Millions will have to retune TV sets following decision to sell frequencies .

"One of the best preserved skeletons of a woolly mammoth, complete with 8ft (2.4 metres) tusks, is going up for auction. The 50,000-year-old mammoth, named Monty, is expected to spark a fierce bidding war on Wednesday 26th November, with some experts suggesting it will sell for £250,000 ($409,000). The specimen, which is an incredible 11.4ft (3.5 metres) high and 18ft (5.5 metres) long, could attract bidders from both museums and private collectors. Scroll down for video . Meet Monty: The 50,000-year-old mammoth is expected to spark a fierce bidding war on Wednesday, with some experts suggesting it will sell for £250,000 ($409,000) Monty was found after spending around 100,000 years under the ice in Siberia, and now Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, West Sussex, is hoping to find a suitable collector. 'This is a virtually complete mammoth skeleton with beautiful tusks, which makes it particularly rare,' said curator Errol Fuller. 'Imagine the mammoth covered in fur - long fur on top with a shorter undercoat - and although quite similar to today's elephant, it had smaller ears and a shorter tail to minimise frostbite and heat loss, so it was well adapted for the ice age. 'Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, stretching across northern Eurasia and North America, so its diet was mainly grass and sedges, which explains why it only had four molar teeth, and also stunning long, curved tusks.' Rare find: Monty is one the best preserved skeletons of a woolly mammoth and still has his huge tusks . Bidding war: The specimen, which is an incredible 11.4ft (3.5 metres) high and 18ft (5.5 metres) long, is expected to attract bidders from both museums and private collectors . Alistair Morris and Linsay Hoadley from Summers Place give the enormous mammoth a final dusting.  Anyone with with enough room to house this skeleton can bid for it at Summers Place in West Sussex . The woolly mammoth is thought to be a male who would have weighed over six tonnes when it roamed Earth. James Rylands, of Summers Place Auctions, said: 'What's exceptional about this one is it's more or less complete with two magnificent tusks. There are one or two toes missing. 'It looks very impressive, the inside curve of the tusks is about 8ft (2.4 metres). It's bigger than an elephant.' The woolly mammoth co-existed with early humans, who hunted them for food and used their bones and tusks for making art. Back from the dead? Scientists hope to bring woolly mammoths back from extinction . Woolly mammoths could be brought back from extinction after a preserved body of one of the ancient animals was found frozen in the snowy wastes of Siberia, scientists hope. The mammoth, which took its last steps around 40,000 years ago, is in such good condition that biologists believe they may be able to clone the creature. An autopsy of the Ice Age beast, which has been nicknamed Buttercup by scientists, will be shown in a documentary later this month. The Channel 4 programme will also examine pioneering work on cloning the woolly mammoth, which is taking place in South Korea and the US. Scientists hope that, eventually, they will be able to reintroduce the huge creatures back into the wild, tens of thousands of years after they became extinct. Insung Hwang, a South Korean geneticist, told the Independent: 'Bringing back the mammoth either through cloning or genetic engineering would be an extremely long process. We're trying hard to make this possible within our generation.' That's why we have to start discussing the implications now. Some of our colleagues are still working on analysing the genome from Buttercup's specimen. This is a long and complicated process that is unlikely to be finished anytime in the near future.' Mammoth sale: Rupert van Der Werff, director of Summers Place Auctions that is selling the mammoth, says the Ice Age remains could fetch up to £250,000 ($409,000) Up until now, the mammoth has been part of an old Eastern European private collection. Due to its huge size, it has only been pieced together recently. 'To the best of my knowledge, I don't think there has been one sold at auction, certainly not in the UK and I don't think in Europe, so it's a first in that respect,' said Mr Rylands. 'It could either go to a museum or if you have a big conservatory it would definitely make a serious statement. 'It's not like a number 14 bus, there isn't going to be another one coming along.' Also up for auction is a stuffed polar bear (left), which is expected to sell for up to £30,000 ($47,000) and the the world's largest ever egg (right) from the Elephant Bird, which is expected to sell for £50,000 ($78,500) A skeleton of a moa, a massive flightless bird, is also going under the hammer during the Wednesday afternoon sale, with a guide price of around £100,000 ($157,100) Up until now, Monty the mammoth has been part of an old Eastern European private collection. Due to its huge size, it has only been pieced together recently . The mammoth will be sold at Summer Place Auctions' 'Evolution' sale on Wednesday, 26th November in Billingshurst, West Sussex.

"A radical ‘artificial egg’ made from plants is set to go global after the US firm behind it revealed major backing from Asia's richest man. Made from plants, it can replace eggs in everything from cakes to mayonnaise - without a chicken ever coming close to the production process. Hampton Creek's products are already sold in Whole Foods in California, and now the firm plans to take on the world. Scroll down for video . Eggstraordinary: The powder is a special blend of plants including peas and beans . MailOnline was able to try two of Hampton Creek’s products - its mayonnaise, and cookies made using its baking product. The results were surprising, if a little anticlimactic. Both tasted exactly as you would expect - and are indistinguishable from products made with real egg. The chocolate chip cookies we tried were excellent - crumbly, moist and with a feel in the mouth identical to a normal cookie. Crucially, they also look identical to a normal cookie - despite containing no egg. Hampton Creek’s ‘Beyond Egg’ mayonnaise was also extremely similar to ‘normal’ mayo - and after trying it out on a few friends, some even preferred to to normal mayonnaise. Today that it was announced the firm has landed $23 million infunding. Backers include Mr. Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest man and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang. In the last 90 days, the company has also signed partnership agreements with 6 Fortune 500 companies, including some of the largest food manufactures and retailers in the world - although the firm is keeping their names secret until products go on sale. Mr. Li Ka-shing, who is estimated to be worth $28.8 billion, said he believed the firm had huge potential. 'Technology enables everyone to have more options to better our future together,' he said. 'To keep up with all the demands for the growing global population, we need to be more efficient, more environmentally friendly, and have more quality and affordable choices. Hampton Creek CEO and founder Josh Tetrick said, 'We live in a time where the unhealthy choice is dirt cheapand convenient, and the healthy choice is pricey and inconvenient. 'When my Dad walks the grocery aisles to buy mayo or chocolate-chip cookies or eggs, the inputs that make them possible often come from bizarrely unhealthy places. 'Our goal has always been to build a company that brings healthier and affordable food to everyone, everywhere. Solving a problem means actually solving the problem for most people – not just the folks that can afford to pay $5.99 for organic eggs. The 'Artificial egg' mayonnaise made from plants is already on sale in California Whole Food stores . ‘We want to take animals out of the equation,' Tetrick has previously told MailOnline. ‘The food industry is begging for innovation, especially where animals are involved - it is a broken industry.’ Tetrick’s idea was to find a mix of easy-to-grow plants that, when mixed together in the right way, replicate the taste, nutritional values and cooking properties of an egg. This, he believes will allow the firm to produce its substitute for mass market foods - and to allow developing worlds to grow their own versions with added nutrients. ‘Eggs are functionally incredible, they do everything from hold oil and water in mayo to making the muffin rise and holding scrambled eggs together,’ he said ‘I started to think what if we can find plants that can do this. We have about 12 plants pre-selected, including a pea already widely grown in Canada. There’s also a bean in South Asia that is incredible in scrambled eggs. Hampton Creek's founders Josh Balk (left) and Josh Tetrick (middle) with Mr. Li Ka-shing, worth an estimated $28.8 billion. The firm is already in talks with major food manufacturers around the world - including several in the UK, to replace eggs in supermarket products with their alternative. So far, he says the team has perfected an egg substitute for mayonnaise, and one for cakes. 'We can make really good mayonnaise, we’ve done taste tests against market leaders, and beaten them consistently. In the world of cookies, we’ve trialled our products with everyone from Bill Gates to Tony Blair, both of whom couldn’t taste the difference. 'Bill Gates became an advisor to the company, and has been one of its most vocal supporters in the Silicon Valley world where Hampton Creek is based. 'Perfect': So far the makers claim to have mastered a recipe for cakes and mayonnaise - but are struggling with scrambled eggs . 'Companies like Hampton Creek Foods are experimenting with new ways to use heat and pressure to turn plants into foods that look and taste just like meat and eggs,' he recently wrote of the firm. It hopes to allow developing countries to grow and produce their own ‘plant eggs’. 'In developing countries, we can also add in things missing from the local diet, helping nutrient deficiencies, and we have had initial discussion with the world food programme about this. 'What we want to do eventually is find a way to work with farmers in the developing world to enable them to have new cash crops that can be used. Then we become the kind of company to be feared by the bad guys in the industry.' The team initially struggled to create a product that worked. 'Our first attempts weren’t great, we tried to make a muffin using a mix of plants,' said Hampton Creek boss Josh Tetrick. 'Ours tasted really gummy, and didn’t have the ‘bounce’ we wanted. 'Our mayonnaise would not hold the oil and egg together, so had what looked like liquid syrup. Scrambled eggs were even worse - they just wouldn’t congeal at all, and had a really bad aftertaste. Tetrick admits the firm is struggling with artificial scrambled egg. He says there is a ‘pretty good’ recipe, but admits more work is needed. 'Eventually we’ll get to one thing that will replace everything,' he said.","$23m investment in Hampton Creek led by Li Ka-shing .

"More than 400 migrants were stopped from getting into Britain from Calais this weekend as they used end-of-summer traffic jams to climb on board vehicles queueing for ferries to Dover. Police found 300 stowaways in 69 trucks on Saturday alone, forcing them to divert freight traffic along a ‘secure route’ accompanied by riot squads. The number of migrants found hidden in vehicles in Calais in 2014 is expected to reach 30,000. Some 3,000 are now found every month. Scroll down for video . Stoaways: Some 3,000 migrants are found smuggling themselves into UK-bound vehicles in Calais every month . The situation has led to haulage firms advising their drivers to bypass Calais, meaning migrants are now targeting other ports with weaker security. Don Amour, of the Freight Transport Association, said: ‘While Calais to Dover remains the preferred route for migrants trying to cross to Britain, our members have reported stowaways trying to get into their vehicles at ports such as Dunkirk, Ostend, Boulogne and St Malo.’ Hafid Derideche, of French haulage firm Atlantic Europe, said: ‘We see more and more migrants in western France, in ports in Brittany and Le Havre.’ The French government will today be urged to approve plans for a ‘Sangatte-style’ camp outside Calais and a series of ‘welcome centres’ for UK-bound migrants across France. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart will tell interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve that providing shelter, food and information on asylum to migrants determined to reach the UK is the only way to take back control of her town. But the proposed camp has been likened to the notorious Red Cross Centre at Sangatte that was used by 60,000 as a springboard for illegal entry to Britain before it was closed in 2002. Mrs Bouchart blames Britain’s generous welfare and asylum systems for attracting a stream of migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East which have brought havoc to the streets of Calais. Action: The French government will be urged to approve plans for a 'Sangatte-style' camp to curb the figures . The influx dramatically increased earlier this year when the crisis in Libya allowed migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan to reach Europe from the North African coast. French authorities are struggling to maintain order with up to 2,000 living in makeshift camps and squats in and around the town. The number could reach up to 5,000 by the end of the year, politicians fear. Armed gangs fight pitched battles for control of the best vantage point from which to break into trucks boarding ferries to Dover. Riot police are expected to launch a fresh assault on the biggest encampment, known as Jungle 2, in the coming days. But local leaders say a crackdown will not end the problem. Under the mayor’s proposals a summer camp for children close to the ferry port will be transformed into a hostel for 400, providing regular meals and washing facilities. Mrs Bouchart has urged the leaders of other towns and villages where migrants have congregated to set up ‘welcome centres’ which will not provide accommodation but will offer advice on their rights. And she will also ask for a change in the law to allow migrants to make applications for asylum in Britain while still in France.","Number of hidden migrants crossing into UK set to reach 30,000 this year .

"Claims: Lutfur Rahman, 48, is accused of using illegal tactics to win a mayoral election . Britain’s first elected Muslim mayor is to face trial over claims he committed widespread voting fraud. Lutfur Rahman, 48, is accused of using illegal tactics to win the mayoral election in Tower Hamlets, East London, in May. People were allegedly promised council houses if they backed him and Islamic voters were told they should be ‘good Muslims’ and support him. His supporters are accused of doctoring ballot papers, manipulating postal voting and sabotaging the chances of his main rival, Labour candidate John Briggs, by branding him racist and anti-Islamic. Four voters have submitted a damaging dossier of evidence to the High Court in an attempt to overturn Mr Rahman’s election victory. Yesterday Mr Justice Supperstone and Mr Justice Spence granted them the right to have their allegations heard at a full trial, which is expected to be heard in Tower Hamlets later this year. Mr Rahman was a member of the Tower Hamlets Labour Party and was its candidate to be the first directly elected mayor of the borough in 2010. But he was expelled from the Labour party after allegations surfaced about his close links with an Islamic extremist group called the Islamic Forum of Europe. Mr Rahman then won the 2010 mayoral contest as an independent candidate. The mayor, who earns around £65,000 a year, was re-elected in May, even though his council was under two separate investigations at the time – one by the Government for alleged misuse of funds and one by the police for fraud. The petition against Mr Rahman was submitted by residents Andrew Erlam, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussain and Angela Moffat. Allegations: Four voters have submitted a damaging dossier of evidence to the High Court (pictured) in an attempt to overturn Mr Rahman's election victory . They claim that supporters of the mayor descended on 41 polling stations at night, ‘making it difficult or impossible for voters to get into the stations’. Bengali voters, especially women, were intercepted by Mr Rahman’s supporters outside polling stations and ‘directed how to vote’, the dossier claims. Labour votes were allegedly ‘crossed out’ on ballot papers and replaced with votes for Mr Rahman’s party, using a different coloured pen. The dossier also alleges that council officers were bullied into ‘securing a certain number of votes’ and were threatened with the sack if they refused. Votes were cast in the names of people who were not ‘entitled to be on the electoral register’ and numerous postal ballots were filled in by the same person, the High Court heard. Signatures on some postal ballots did not match the signatures on application forms previously submitted and a voluntary organisation was given grants in exchange for votes, it was said. Rivals: Supporters of Mr Rahman (right) are accused of doctoring ballot papers, manipulating postal voting and sabotaging the chances of Labour candidate John Briggs (left), by branding him racist and anti-Islamic . Ahmed Hussain, a losing Conservative Party candidate, told the Mail: ‘Mr Rahman and his supporters carried out fraud on a massive scale. ‘Voters turned up at the polling station . to be told they had already sent in a postal vote and therefore could . not vote again. But they hadn’t – Rahman supporters had stolen their . votes and now it was too late. ‘His men would target the vulnerable - the elderly, women and single parents - and offer to “help” them with their vote. This would mean filling out a postal vote in front of the party voters who would then check they had voted for Rahman. ‘They would offer to post votes, but check them first. If they had not voted for Rahman then they would simply scrub it out and tick the Rahman party box. ‘They offered to pay for the votes of relatives who were out of the country - £10 or £15 each. And they made people add members of their household so they too could vote.’ The 46-year-old, who works for the NHS, said Mr Rahman also used more subtle ways to intimidate voters into supporting him. Mr Hussain, who is originally from Bangladesh, says the alleged fraud has nothing to do with ‘cultural traditions or practices’ of the many Asian voters in Tower Hamlets. He added: ‘It’s nothing religious. It’s nothing cultural. This is illegal full stop. This would be illegal in Bangladesh as it is in the UK.’ Last night Mr Rahman strenuously . denied allegations of electoral fraud. He said: ‘There is simply no . evidence to substantiate that the recent elections results were due to . fraud and intimidation. ‘It . is clear that these complaints are being generated by disgruntled . candidates who lost. I am completely confident that at the end of this . process such claims will be exposed for the smears that they are.’ Rahman and supporters of his Tower Hamlets First (THF) party were also accused of bribing voters. In an application to the High Court petitioner Andrew Erlam said: ‘A THF council candidate telling [told] voters that if they vote for THF they will all get [local authority] houses. ‘A THF candidate handing [handed] out lollipops to children whose parents came to vote.’ 'His men would target the vulnerable - the elderly, women and single parents - and offer to ""help"" them with their vote' Ahmed Hussain, losing Conservative Party candidate . Mr Erlam, a Labour Party supporter, added that Rahman supporters intercepted Bengali voters, especially women, outside polling stations, ‘accompanied’ them to polling booths and ‘directed them how to vote’. He claimed in one ward votes for Labour were ‘crossed out’ and ‘Tower Hamlets First votes entered with a different colour pen’. He added in another ward Labour votes ‘appeared to have been erases’ on a ‘substantial number’ of postal ballot papers. And that counting agents ‘reported that many postal ballots to have been completed in the same hand writing’.

"A landlord has won a planning battle against officials to keep a large unauthorised extension which will include a sauna for his student tenants. Ikhlaq Hussain was ordered to tear down the front and back additions to the terraced house in Selly Oak, Birmingham, because he had them built without planning permission. However after a legal wrangle council planners have decided he can keep the extensions, with the number of bedrooms cut from eight to six and, bizarrely, permission for the two rooms to be used as a sauna and laundry room. Council planners said 'times had changed' and it was now not unusual to have a sauna in a student property, but neighbours have complained a number of times about the development. James O'Callaghan complained about an unauthorised extension next door at a student house in Selly Oak which has just been given planning permission by the council - including for a room to be used as a sauna . The council launched enforcement action against Mr Hussain last year after it discovered the extension had been built without permission. Selly Oak has been the subject of a growing number of complaints about extensions because the area has become popular with student landlords eager to convert family homes to have as many bedrooms as possible. James O'Callaghan, who lives next door to the property, said the construction had made his family's life a nightmare for the past year. He said there had been building disturbance, water damage to his house from poor drainage, and  having to battle the plans at every turn. 'It's caused no end of trouble,' he said. Residents' spokesman Barry Toon added: 'We are not talking about a naive first time landlord, but a man with a property portfolio in the area.' Ikhlaq Hussain won the planning battle to keep the large extension which was built at the front and back . Permission has been granted for a sauna to be installed at the six bedroom student house in Birmingham . A retrospective planning application was rejected by officials in August and was upheld on appeal. It was classified as an 'unneighbourly form of development.' But chief planning officer Richard Goulborn stuck up for Mr Hussain, who was not present at the meeting. Mr Goulborn said he had been given bad advice by a previous planning agent and the new application was acceptable. Asked about the sauna, Mr Goulborn said: 'I am told it is not uncommon to have a sauna in this type of student property.' 'Times have changed,' said committee chairman Coun Mike Sharpe. However Coun Peter Douglas Osborn said the enforcement should have been upheld. He said: 'At some point we are going to have to send in a JCB, as much as a warning to any other landlords.'","Ikhlaq Hussain won planning battle to keep extensions to student home .

"Nasa has awarded biggest prize in aviation history to an electric plane after its team designed a craft that flew 200miles in two hours. The $1.35million prize was handed to the crew behind the Taurus G4 plane designed by the Pipistrel-USA team. The Taurus G4 was in competition against two other craft as part of the CAFE Green Flight Challenge final, backed by Nasa, which aimed to make green air travel a realistic possibility. It's electric: The Taurus G4 plane which won a $1.35million prize from Nasa as part of the CAFE Green Flight Challenge final . On the ground: The Taurus G4 is a twin fuselage design, meaning it has two cockpits either side of a large central propeller . A second prize of $120,000 was awarded to the very close runner-up, California-based Team e-Genius, while the third entrant - a gasoline-powered plane from Florida-based Phoenix Air team - left empty handed. Some 14 teams entered the competition in its early stages with planes powered variously by electric engines, biofuels and gasoline engines, but the two prize-winners were both electric aircraft. 'Two years ago the thought of flying 200 miles at 100 mph in an electric aircraft was pure science fiction,' said Jack W. Langelaan, team leader of Team Pipistrel-USA. 'Now, we are all looking forward to the future of electric aviation.' Runner up: The e-Genius aircraft came a very close second to the Taurus G4, but it did win the $10,000 Lindbergh prize for the quietest aircraft . In flight: The e-Genius soared majestically over the countryside . Ultra-light: The e-Genius was partly funded by Airbus, the European aviation giant . Nasa said that the Taurus G4's feat of meeting its requirements to win the competition had proved 'ultra-efficient aviation is within our grasp.' Dual-fuselage design . Ultralight construction . Wingspan: 75ft . Propeller: 6.5ft-wide . Powered by: 450lbs of lithium-polymer batteries . 'Today we've shown that electric aircraft have moved beyond science fiction and are now in the realm of practice,' said Joe Parrish, Nasa's acting chief technologist. To win the prize the Taurus had to fly 200 miles in less than two hours and use less than one gallon of fuel per occupant, or the equivalent in electricity. Both the winner and runner up achieved better efficiency than required and completed the challenge on the equivalent of just over a half-gallon of fuel per passenger. Historic links: Erik Lindbergh, the grandson of aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh, was present to award the $10,000 Lindbergh Prize for Quietest Aircraft to the runner-up, Team e-Genius . Pioneer: Charles Lindbergh pictured in 1927 with his famous Spirit of St Louis plane in which he became the first man to fly solo across the Atlantic . The Taurus G4 flew a round trip from Charles M. Schulz Sonoma County Airport in Santa Rosa, California, and while it  was only required to fly 200 miles for the competition the crew says it could already fly four people up to 300 miles on its current power source. The prize-giving is the culmination of more than two years of aircraft design, development and testing for the teams, who collectively spent more than $4million in pursuit of the prize. CAFE (Comparative Aircraft Flight Efficiency) organises the competition under an agreement with Nasa, which regularly uses competitions to encourage new blood into its technology research programmes for spaceflight and aeronautics. Major historical competitions have included the $25,000 Orteig Prize for nonstop trans-Atlantic flight. That prize was won by Charles Lindbergh whose grandson, Erik Lindbergh, was present to award the $10,000 Lindbergh Prize for Quietest Aircraft to the runner-up, Team eGenius.",Taurus G4 craft flew 200miles in two hours to win Nasa's $1.35m prize .
"An investigation has been launched after three airlines reported drones flying dangerously close to planes on the approach to New York's JFK Airport. Flight crew on a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 first spotted an unmanned drone as the jumbo jet made its final approach on a flight from London last Sunday evening. The captain told officials that the drone was flying at an altitude of around 3,000ft in airspace over Nassau County, just east of the airport. A Virgin Atlantic pilot alerted air traffic control after spotting a drone at an altitude of 3,000ft . Radio-controlled drones have skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the growing trend of aerial photography . Around a minute later, a Delta Air Lines pilot who was behind the controls of a Boeing 737 arriving from San Diego told air traffic controllers that the drone was flying too close to its left wing as it flew over Nassau County, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). According to an audio recording obtained by NBC News, the Delta pilot told the air traffic control tower: ‘We just had something fly over us. I don’t know if it was a drone or a balloon, it just came real quick.’ Another incident was reported on Wednesday afternoon as a JetBlue plane from Savannah, Georgia, prepared to land at JFK. Nassau County police were unable to locate the drone during an aerial search by helicopter . The drone was flying at about 400ft as it buzzed near the Airbus A320 over Nassau County. Air traffic control recordings captured the pilot's concern telling controllers that the drone looked like it was flying right on the final approach, NBC reported. Despite raising concerns, none of the pilots had to take evasive action and all three planes landed safely. A drone was flying at about 400ft as it buzzed a JetBlue Airbus A320 over Nassau County . Local police, the FBI and FAA were all notified, and Nassau County police were unable to locate the drone or its operator during an aerial search by helicopter. If the operator is identified, he or she could face criminal charges. Unmanned drones have skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the growing trend of aerial photography, and they have become a serious problem for airports and pilots as many operators are not aware of the rules or dangers. There have been dozens of reports of drones flying too close to airports or commercial aircraft, and experts say the radio-controlled devices pose a significant threat because they could be sucked into a jet engine. Three commercial pilots encountered drones while making their final approach to JFK Airport in New York . Hobbyists are allowed to use drones for recreational flights but the tiny aircraft are not permitted within five miles of airports and they must be kept far from planes. Ken Honig, a former high-ranking official with the Port Authority, which operates major airports in New York City and some New Jersey cities, told NBC that drone operators probably don't realise the devastating damage they could cause. He said: ‘These planes are all being approached [by drones] while the planes are landing, so they're close to the ground, which means the pilot doesn't have a whole lot of room for manoeuvring. ‘If the unmanned aerial vehicle gets too close to a plane, it could get sucked into a jet engine. The kind of damage done by a bird could be amplified by the metal parts in a UAV.’","Three commercial airline pilots reported unmanned drones in one week .

"The BBC has come under fire again over its attitude to drugs after a radio presenter failed to challenge artist David Hockney about his cannabis habit. The 77-year-old told Radio 4’s Today programme that while he rarely leaves his Los Angeles home because of his deafness, he does go out to visit ‘the doctors, the bookshop and the marijuana store’. Last night his interviewer Jim Naughtie was criticised for allowing the remark to go unchallenged. The BBC has come under fire again over its attitude to drugs after a radio presenter Jim Naughtie (right) failed to challenge artist David Hockney (left) about his cannabis habit . It comes a day after Today was accused of ‘celebrating drugs culture’ in a news piece about the launch of a Bob Marley cannabis company. Mary Brett, of campaign group Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘The BBC always seem to let this kind of thing go. Jim Naughtie should have challenged him... I was amazed he just let the comment pass.’ Hockney, whose assistant died last year after a drugs binge, has long called for cannabis, which is legal in California, to be legalised in the UK. He says he takes the ‘harmless and pleasant’ drug for medical reasons. In a separate interview with the Observer this week, Hockney hinted that his cannabis use is driven by pleasure as much as need. Revealing he holds a ‘medical marijuana patient verification card’, he said: ‘To get this you have to say, “Well, bad back, anxiety or something” and you just get it. ‘And it’s very nice actually. I don’t smoke much, but sometimes of an evening, because I don’t have alcohol any more, a bit of marijuana’s nice.’ David Hockney (pictured) says he takes the ‘harmless and pleasant’ drug for medical reasons . A lifelong smoker of the drug, Hockney has long called for it to be legalised in the UK and once described it as a ‘harmless and pleasant plant’. He told Today that he had lived his whole life ‘in Bohemia’, adding: ‘It meant you weren’t suburban’. But he complained: ‘It is the suburbs that have taken over Bohemia now and look what they’ve done. No smoking, no this, no that. They are ruining it. Absolutely ruining it.’ Last year, the painter’s 23-year-old studio assistant Dominic Elliott died from swallowing toxic toilet cleaner after a 24-hour binge on alcohol, cocaine, Ecstasy and cannabis. His former lover John Fitzherbert was arrested over the death, but was not charged. Soon afterwards, Hockney moved from Bridlington, east Yorkshire, back to Los Angeles, where he has lived on and off since 1964. The artist – who wears two hearing aids - said he now spends most of his time in his secluded villa as he can no longer hear people at parties or enjoy music. He said: ‘I work even harder I think now actually. Because I just work all the time, I don’t go out from here. I’m too deaf. If there are three or four people in the room I can’t [hear them]. ‘I don’t have much social life and I don’t really mind that much actually, because I’ve got something to do here. I’m discovering things all the time still. So I’m perfectly happy here. I never leave the house. ‘At a party I’d be there but I’d not be there. I couldn’t hear anybody talking and so I just really don’t feel like going. And I’m okay here, I have plenty to do.’ Explaining what first attracted him to Los Angeles, he added: ‘The light is ten times brighter here. I remember one or two people saying to me, “Why have you come here to this cultural backwater?” ‘Well I didn’t’ see it as a cultural backwater. I said “Some of the great works of art of the 20th century were made here. Modern Times, City lights, Some Like it Hot. What do you mean cultural backwater, it’s not.""'","Artist said he rarely leaves his LA home but does to visit 'the doctors, the bookshop and the marijuana store'

"The most controversial participant on thought-provoking TV show First Contact failed to show up to SBS's live discussion about the documentary on Thursday night. Newcastle woman Sandy Clifford, who made no secret of her views about Aboriginal people and said she didn’t ‘f***ing care’ if people thought she was racist, neglected to appear in the live round-up despite being touted in adverts for it. It comes after she lied to producers about getting her nails done and escaped on a flight back to Sydney halfway through filming the series. Host Stan Grant did not explain where she was but simply said: ‘Sandy couldn't be here tonight.’ Scroll down for video . Mortgage broker Sandy walked off SBS TV show First Contact halfway through filming . The 41-year-old lied to producers about getting her nails done before escaping on a flight back to Sydney . During the show Sandy said: ‘God gave black people rhythm and soul. They can dance and sing and are hot while they dance, but when it comes to brains, white people have a better gene, better make up.' SBS had promised: ‘After a journey of conflict and discovery, Sandy, Trent, Alice, Jasmine, Marcus and Bo-dene will be reunited and joined by Indigenous people they met and a studio audience.’ The 41-year-old dramatically quit the SBS documentary series, which took six Australians to meet Aboriginal communities around the country, on day 13 of a 28-day shoot while filming in Alice Springs. The show's producer Darren Dale, from Blackfella Films, told Daily Mail Australia: 'She said she was going to get her nails done.’ 'Then when she hadn't come back, when we couldn't find her our instinct was she's flown to Sydney. 'With the timing it was 10.30am and a plane left at 11.30am, we had a pretty good hunch she got a plane.' Mr Dale said they sent one of their crew members based in Sydney to the airport who found her walking off the plane. Mr Dale also revealed that the mother of five is of Syrian, German and Caucasian descent and the father of her children is Maori. It also emerged that the mother of five is of Syrian, German and Caucasian descent and the father of her children is Maori . Some viewers on social media remarked that it was odd she held such strong views about Indigenous Australians when she had mixed race children . Sandy pulled out of the show shortly after a trip to the remote community Elcho Island, off Arnhem Land . Some viewers on social media remarked that it was odd she held such strong views about Indigenous Australians when she had mixed race children, but Mr Dale said he believed Sandy was just unapologetically set in her beliefs. 'Sandy is like a force of nature, I think she's got such a wilful personality and I think her views transcend everything,' he said. 'She clearly thinks what she thinks, she doesn't care about race, religion, creed.' Sandy told news.com.au she left the show because she'd had enough of the experiences and because tensions were flaring with fellow participant Alice. 'I’m thinking, ""For f*** sake, are you for real? I’m not putting up with this s*** for the next 18 days. I’ve got enough drama at home"",' she said. Faced with sleeping in a child’s bed at an Aboriginal family's house in Sydney, she said: 'I'm not staying here, I can’t. I know what happens on those mattresses.' 'I had a lot of stuff going on at home as well, with a divorce, and my children back here in Newcastle.' It has also emerged that she no longer works as a mortgage broker in Newcastle. A spokeswoman for her former employer, financial planning firm Chase Edwards, said Sandy was 'no longer with us', despite the fact her LinkedIn profile listed her as being currently employed there. ‘Sandy’s not worked at Chase Edwards for approximately six months and she’s not associated with the company in any way,’ she said. The TV show filmed in April this year. From left: Sandy, Trent, Jasmine, host Ray Martin, Alice, Bo-dene and Marcus, from new series First Contact . Sandy is welcomed by an Aboriginal girl when the cast visits Nyinyikay, in the Northern Territory . The most controversial of the show's participants said she didn’t ‘f***ing care’ if people thought she was racist . 'If you're out there and you're looking at f***ing kangaroos go past and snakes and build a fire, like f***, how much more can you learn?,' Sandy said on screen. Faced with sleeping in a child’s bed at a house in Sydney, the mother-of-five pulled no punches. ‘F***, I’m not staying’, she said. ‘I can’t. I know what happens on those mattresses. They’re all sleeping on it with their sweat, their drinking and their partying, all their boozing and all their yahooing and I ain't sleeping on it. It's dirty.’ Sandy, described on the show as a mother of five mixed race children, also initially claimed that Aboriginals had ‘whinged too much’ about the stolen generation of children snatched from their parents to be brought up in white society. Jasmine (left) and Bo-dene (right) were among six Australians who spent a month in Aboriginal communties . However, after hearing first hand from a family affected by the policy, she softened her views. The group of six responded in dramatically different ways to their experience, with some embracing Aboriginal culture and others struggling to come to terms with what they saw. After starting out in Sydney, the group travelled to Nyinyikay, in the Northern Territory, where the men took part in a turtle hunt. The slaughter of the creature took place the next day and was deeply divisive with some of the women openly crying. On episode two, to air on Wednesday night, the group visit remote community Elcho Island, off Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. Sandy pulled out of the show shortly afterwards. Jasmine says that months after filming she feels like some of her questions went unanswered, and she still believes it is unfair Aborigines get higher welfare payments and placements in university . The 33-year-old mother of four from Brisbane became distressed when watching a turtle be killed for food . Similar to the acclaimed Go Back To Where You Came From, the show takes six 'ordinary' Australians and immerses them in Aboriginal communities to try to challenge their prejudices about the Indigenous population. 'Petrol sniffing', 'wasters' and 'spending their dole cheques on booze' are among the labels the six people give to Aborigines at first. Host Ray Martin said none of the opinions he heard on the show shocked him, as he had heard them many times before. The veteran journalist and passionate advocate for Aboriginal issues said six out of 10 Australians have never met or have little to do with an Indigenous person. 'The Aboriginal problem is a festering sore of Australian society, it's one of those things we have to fix,' Mr Martin said. 'So we thought we would take six people - average Aussies who weren't racists, or weirdos or nutters – and have people willing to ask questions and willing to question their beliefs. 'Why do they drink so much, why don't they send their kids to school, why don't they leave townships and get a job? They are all valid questions and not racist questions.'

"Spill all: Anna Gristina, pictured, says she will name names in a tell-all book . The infamous mother-of-four who admitted to running a prostitution ring in New York has vowed to spill the names of her Johns in a tell-all memoir. Scot Anna Gristina also revealed that football fans will be particularly interested in the contents of her little black book. The 44-year-old spoke after a brief court hearing in Manhattan today where she got the OK to fly to Los Angeles to appear on the talkshow 'Dr Phil.' 'I will be' naming names, Gristina told the New York Daily News. When asked for a teaser of the calibre of Johns her prostitution ring catered to, she said, grinning: 'Let's just say if you like football (you'll be interested).' She is also set to reveal details of her 15 year career as a pimp during her Dr Phil appearance, which is due for filming next Wednesday and Thursday to be aired about a week later. 'There is going to be a giant name dropped - actually, a couple of them,' Gristina told The New York Post, referring to her upcoming interview. When the newspaper asked if the names would be 'giant' with a capital 'G,' the mother gave a mischievous laugh before promoting the show and specifying who in the world of football might be in the firing line. 'Everyone's going to have to watch Dr Phil,' she said. 'I will tell you that one of the names is high-level (NFL) management. Then there's an older (football) player who's still very well known. Tune in to Dr Phil!' Gristina was sentenced to six months in jail followed by five years probation on November 20. She has previously boasted of a plentiful supply of well-to-do customers. Last month, U.S. prosecutors said the Edinburgh, Scotland, native who lives in Monroe, New York, had been the madam of a Manhattan sex service for 15 years. The mother first claimed she ran a . dating service, but later admitted to the single charge of promoting . prostitution as part of a plea deal at Manhattan Supreme Court on . September 26. 'Manhattan Madam' gets sentenced: Anna Gristina sits in the Manhattan Supreme Court with her attorney Norman Pattis on November 20, 2012 . Media magnet: Gristina leaves the New York State Supreme Court with her husband and attorney after receiving her jail sentence . When Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan asked Gristina if she had anything to say in court after the sentencing, she replied: 'It's probably better that I don't, Your Honor.' As well as the jail term and probation, the woman may be deported as a result of her conviction. Her sentence stems from an incident in July 2011 when authorities say Gristina set up a rendezvous between two female prostitutes and an undercover police officer posing as a client. Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's office caught her on tape arranging for the officer to watch the two prostitutes have sex in her E. 78th St. brothel. Jail time: Gristina, who pleaded guilty in September to promoting a high-end, sex-for-pay prostitution ring, was sentenced to six months in jail with an additional five years' probation . Done deal: Gristina's attorney Pattis, left, walks next to her husband Gorr, right, as they leave the Manhattan Supreme Court after her sentencing . Gristina was arrested in February as she was leaving a fundraising meeting for her business, prosecutors said. She spent nearly four months in jail on Riker's Island and was released in June on a $250,000 US dollar (£157,000) bond. Prosecutors said their five-year investigation revealed that Gristina netted an estimated $10 million (£6.4 million) from her business, which was said to include a roster of wealthy clients. Despite her plea, she insists she never crossed the . line, and blames her friends and alleged accomplice Janie Mae Baker for . turning on her. Not so discreet: Gristina proudly showed off . pictures of her younger husband Gorr posing half naked with her on a . school reunion website . 'Sometimes people get great deals for being state's witnesses, for . being rats,' her defense attorney Norman Pattis said in court on Tuesday. 'I think in . this case Ms. Baker decide to flip and roll over to get a deal.' Pattis said Gristina had entertained the thought of recanting her plea in favor of going to trial. Gristina resides with her family on a 12-acre property in Monroe, which is about 50 miles (80km) north of New York City. She previously spent time helping abandoned pet pigs find new homes, her lawyers said. She housed any number that were unwanted and kept them as pets, they said. Gristina told friends and family members . in Scotland that she worked in internet marketing and had a sideline . gig as a real estate agent. Double life: The suburban home Gristina and Kelvin Gorr live in with their son Nicholas and their pigs and dogs in Monroe, upstate New York . Unusual pet: One of the six pot-bellied pigs Gristina keeps at her home, which houses many rescue animals . Over the years neighbours reported black chauffeur-driven limos dropping off clients at all times of the day and night. Gristina's employees reportedly included many Playboy and Penthouse models. 'There is nothing glamorous about prostitution,' Erin Duggan of the . Manhattan District Attorney’s office said in a written statement. 'Anna Gristina rented women's . bodies for profit, which makes her a pimp. That also makes her a felon, . and the court has now issued that judgment.' Gristina's husband, Kelvin Gorr, said there was a 'sense of relief that it's over.' 'This was in the best interest of the kids, just . to start over and move on,' he said. To . her friends and neighbours, she was simply a homely American housewife . and mother of four, with a soft spot for animals. Pigs, in particular, . were her passion and at her suburban home outside New York she housed . any number that were unwanted and kept them as pets. She . explained, when asked by her friends and the family she had long left . behind in Scotland, that she worked in internet marketing and had a . sideline as an estate agent.

"It looks like something you’d expect to see launch from Tracy Island. But this Thunderbirds-style aircraft could be the future of long-haul flights. The hypersonic X-51A WaveRider belongs to the US military and uses a revolutionary ‘scramjet’ engine to reach 4,500mph within seconds. Scroll down for video . London to New York in Less than an hour: The X-51A Waverider is designed to ride on its own shockwave, accelerating to about Mach 6 . Arduous journeys for holidaymakers could be a thing of the past if the technology takes off. A trip across the Atlantic from London to New York would take the plane just one hour, travelling at five times the speed of sound. Today the cutting-edge craft will be dropped from a B52 bomber over the Pacific Ocean in its latest test. It will be flown from Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert in California, attached to the bomber’s wing. Scramjets . are 'airbreathing' aircraft because rather than carrying both fuel and . the oxygen needed to provide acceleration, they carry only hydrogen fuel . and 'pull' the oxygen needed to burn it from the atmosphere. Air . is forced into the front of the engine and as hydrogen is injected into . the airstream, the gases are compressed causing the temperature to rise . and ignition to occur. This . generates huge amounts of thrust and enables the jet to travel at . speeds far in excess of the 1,350mph top speed of Concorde. The jet will then be dropped from almost 50,000ft near the Point Mugu promontory. A rocket booster will ignite and speed it up to about Mach 4.5 and, if all goes well, the aircraft’s engine will take over from there, pushing the speed to more than Mach 6 and lifting the craft to 70,000ft. The mission will last 300 seconds – the longest the craft has ever flown to date. After the historic test, the plane will crash into the sea, and there are no plans to recover it. Hypersonic flight – which relates to speeds of more than five times the speed of sound – is seen as the next step for aircraft. ‘Attaining sustained hypersonic flight is like going from propeller-driven aircraft to jet aircraft,’ Robert Mercier, deputy for technology in the high speed systems division at the Air Force Research Laboratory in Ohio told the Los Angeles Times. ‘Since the Wright brothers, we have examined how to make aircraft better and faster. Hypersonic flight is one of those areas that is a potential frontier for aeronautics. I believe we’re standing in the door waiting to go into that arena.’ The project is being funded by Nasa and the Pentagon, which hope it can be used for military stealth aircraft and new weapons. The WaveRider programme is estimated to cost £89million, according to Globalsecurity.org, a website for military policy research. It has had a mixed history, with previous tests being aborted after the engine stalled. Currently the fastest passenger plane in the world is the Cessna Citation X, which has a top speed of 700mph or Mach 0.9, although it takes only seven passengers. In its wake is the Falcon 7X at 685mph and the Gulfstream G550, which is capable of 675mph. The experimental craft was tested strapped to the wing of a B-52 bomber. Once released, it's radical scramjet engines was fired, hopefully  accelerating the craft up to Mach 6, over 2,000 metres per second . The X-51A Waverider on the wing of a B-52 Stratofortress. A previous test was the longest supersonic combustion ramjet-powered hypersonic flight to date. Mach is a measure of the ratio of the velocity of an object, in this case a plane, to the velocity of sound, which equals Mach 1, or 761.2 miles per hour. Any plane that flies past the speed of sound creates a sonic boom, which often results in a major noise disturbance over close-by areas. Before its 2003 retirement, Concorde was long the shuttle of choice for executives eager to spend as little time as possible in the air and unafraid to shell out thousands for a 3.5-hour transatlantic flight. An attempt to launch a hypersonic flight in August last year failed when the soaring heat caused the craft’s surface to peel and the experiment ended prematurely. The Pentagon’s research arm calls hypersonic flight ‘the new stealth’ for its promise of evading and outrunning enemy fire. The effort to develop hypersonic engines is necessary because they can propel vehicles at a velocity that cannot be achieved from traditional turbine-powered jet engines. Experts believe hypersonic missiles are the best way to hit a target in an hour or less. The only vehicle that the military currently has in its inventory with that kind of capability is the massive, nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile. The scramjet engine  is designed to ride on its own shockwave, and should see the test craft accelerate to about Mach 6.","Scramjet engine can accelerate craft to over Mach 6 .

"Plans for a network of cycle pathways high above the streets of London have been unveiled by one of the world's most prominent architects. SkyCycle is a 135-mile network of roads that would be constructed above existing suburban rail lines to create new cycle routes throughout the capital and has been developed by cycling enthusiast Sir Norman Foster, who designed St Mary Axe, known as 'The Gherkin', and the new Wembley Stadium. The three-storey high routes would be accessed via ramps at more than 200 points. The first phase is a four mile stretch from east London to Liverpool Street Station would cost an estimated £220m. I want to ride my bicycle: The SkyCycle, as proposed new network of cycle paths built above London's railways . Each of the 10 proposed routes can accommodate 12,000 cyclists per hour and will improve journey times by up to 29 minutes, it is claimed . The developers say almost six million . people live within the catchment area of the proposed network, half of . whom live and work within 10 minutes of an entrance. Each of the 10 proposed routes can accommodate 12,000 cyclists per hour and will improve journey times by up to 29 minutes, the developers added. They also claim the scheme, which would be built over 20 years, providing capacity at a much lower cost than building new roads and tunnels. Lord Foster said: 'Cycling is one of my great passions – particularly with a group of friends. And I believe that cities where you can walk or cycle, rather than drive, are more congenial places in which to live. Three storeys high . 10 mph - average cycle speed in London . 15 mph - estimated speed after SkyCycle . 20 feet wide decks . 20 years to build . 29 minutes less journey time . 135 miles over existing railway services . 12,000 cyclists per hour . 5.8 million people live close to proposed route . £220 million to build first four-mile stretch . 'To improve the quality of life for all in London and to encourage a new generation of cyclists, we have to make it safe. 'However, the greatest barrier to segregating cars and cyclists is the physical constraint of London’s streets, where space is already at a premium. 'SkyCycle is a lateral approach to finding space in a congested city. By using the corridors above the suburban railways, we could create a world-class network of safe, car-free cycle routes that are ideally located for commuters.' The developers - Exterior Architecture, Foster + Partners and Space Syntax - added that London’s railway lines were originally built for steam trains and as a result follow contours that naturally reduce the amount of energy expended and avoid steep gradients, a boon for cyclists. Sam Martin of Exterior Architecture Ltd said: 'SkyCycle is an urban cycling solution for London. A cycling utopia, with no buses, no cars and no stress. 'We are incredibly excited at how, together with Foster + Partners, our idea has been developed and now more recently turned into a truly world-changing scenario by Space Syntax for revolutionising cycling in London and possibly the world.' However, cycling charity CTC has raised concerns over the wind exposure cyclist would face at such a height, and the steepness of the ramps required to reach the SkyCycle. Cycling in London is on the rise as a result of increasing congestion and rising fuel costs. File pictures . A cyclist receives emergency medical treatment after being involved in an accident with a lorry in Camden, east London, in November. Six cyclists died in a two week period that same month . Road safety in London recently came to the fore after six cyclists were killed on the capital's roads in the space of under two weeks in November. Brian Holt, 62; Francis Golding, 69, Roger William De Klerk, 43, Venera Minakhmetova, 24, a 21-year-old man from St John’s Wood and a man believed to be in his 60s all died between November 5 and 18. A spokesman for Network Rail said: 'We welcome the proposals which have been put forward by Foster + Partners and Exterior Architecture and are always happy to look at ways we can contribute to improving travel and transport in London. 'We will continue to liaise with all involved as the aspiration for this innovative scheme develops.' Over the last decade, cycling has grown by 70 per cent – on major roads the number of cyclists has increased by 173 per cent. However, this still only translates as two per cent of all journeys and falls short of many other UK and European cities. Road safety is a key factor: Between 2006 and 2011, the number of cycling casualties rose by half. Cycling accounts for just two per cent of daily journeys, but 20 per cent of deaths and serious casualties on the roads. London’s population is expected to grow by 12 per cent over the next decade, matching and then exceeding its previous high of 8.6million in 1939.","'SkyCycle' is a proposal for a series of three-storey-high paths .

"A multimillionaire football boss has been accused of racism after reportedly saying that every Englishman has at some time called a ‘Chinaman a chink’. Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan, 77, also allegedly told the Guardian that ‘Jewish people chase money more than everybody else’. The former owner of JJB Sports – who is thought to be worth around £200million – is reported to have made the remarks as he defended his appointment of Malky Mackay as the new manager of the club. Scroll down for video . Wigan FC owner Dave Whelan (pictured left) has been accused of anti-Semitism after claiming 'Jewish people chase money more than everybody else' Ex-Cardiff City manager Mackay is under investigation by the Football Association after supposedly exchanging offensive messages with the club’s ex-head of recruitment Iain Moody. The texts included one where Mackay described Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan, as a ‘chink’. In another, he referred to Jewish agent Phil Smith, saying: ‘Nothing like a Jew that sees money slipping through his fingers.’ And in a third, Mackay said there were ‘enough dogs in Cardiff to go round’ after he signed South Korean international Kim Bo-kyung. Dave Whelan (right), who owns Wigan Athletic, made the comment a day after sparking anger by hiring Malky Mackay (left) as the club's new head coach . Defending the manager’s appointment, Mr Whelan said he did not regard Mackay’s comments as offensive. He reportedly said he used the word ‘chink’ when he was young, adding: ‘If any Englishman said he has never called a Chinaman a chink he is lying.’ He is also reported to have said: ‘I think Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else. I don’t think that’s offensive at all.’ Today, Mr Whelan (left next to Malkay Mackay), the former owner of the JJB Sports chain, claimed the scandal surrounding the texts and emails was a 'mountain out of a molehill' Mr Whelan's decision to hand Mackay a return to football has been widely criticised . Mr Whelan claimed he did not think there was ‘a lot wrong’ with what Mackay said, adding: ‘I did ask Malky questions about the problems he’s had on the racist thing. He admits what he did and apologised for what he said. I accept that totally. I think Malky has been so unlucky. He has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it. It’s not like we are all saints.’ Former FA executive Simon Johnson, who is now chief executive at the Jewish Leadership Council, insisted: ‘Mackay used offensive language to insult a fellow participant in football using a tawdry racial stereotype.’ And yesterday two of the team’s sponsors ended their arrangement with the club, with kitchen appliances firm Premier Range describing its position as ‘untenable’. But a spokesman for Mr Whelan said: ‘The quotes were taken out of context and twisted.’ Mr Whelan later apologised for his remarks. On the Chinese . If any Englishman said he has never called a Chinaman a chink he is lying. There is nothing bad about doing that. It is like calling the British Brits, or the Irish paddies. On the Jews . The Jews don’t like losing money. Nobody likes losing money. Do you think Jewish people chase money a little bit more than we do? I think they are very shrewd people. I think Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else. I don’t think that’s offensive at all. It’s telling the truth.

"A married mother and her firefighter lover plotted to kill her husband and then shot him dead, police have said. Jonathan Michael Hearn, 24, and Sabrina Limon, 35, were both arrested on Wednesday for the murder of her husband, 38-year-old Robert Limon. Mr Limon, a rail worker with Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, was shot multiple times in his upper body on August 17 inside the building where he worked in Tehachapi, California. After his death, his wife, with whom he had two children, expressed her grief on her Facebook page, calling him an 'AMAZING man' who 'will never be forgotten'. 'Plot': Robert Limon, pictured left, was found shot dead in August and now his wife Sabrina, pictured, and her secret younger lover, firefighter Jonathan Hearn, have been arrested for allegedly killing him . But over three months of investigations, authorities discovered that she had actually been having an affair with Hearn before her husband was killed. 'Jonathan Heard had become involved in a romantic relationship with Sabrina Limon in the months leading up to Robert Limon's murder,' Ray Pruitt with the sheriff's department said. 'We are confident that the two people we arrested yesterday are responsible for his murder.' Authorities have not revealed how the pair met, although they both lived in the same area in the high desert, CBSLA reported. Police are still appealing for help in the case. They previously released surveillance footage showing a man walking through the railway building's yard around the time of the killing. He has not yet been identified. 'Cold-hearted': After her husband's death, Sabrina Limon posted about her heartbreak on Facebook . Accused: Hearn, pictured left, and Mrs Limon, right, allegedly had an affair for months before the killing . Mr Limon had returned to the shop area after 5pm on August 17 after working in the field all day and was found killed that evening. 'Hopefully somebody in the community will recognize the person of interest and we can talk to that person,' Pruitt said in August. After his death, his wife paid tribute to him in a lengthy Facebook post. 'The love he gave was more than some ever will feel or show,' she wrote. 'I will carry it with me where ever I go, and remind our children of it daily as they grow. It’s a feeling of joy, yet I’m totally numb to the fact that I’m left on earth now without him.' Hearn and Sabrina Limon were both arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, while Limon also faces accessory to murder charges. Friends expressed their shock that she could be involved. Ellie Chandler, a family friend, told the Desert Dispatch that the Limons an 'all-American family' with a young son and daughter. Questions: Authorities released surveillance video showing the railway yard where Mr Limon was killed. Cops are trying to find out the identity of the person (circled) who was there around the time of the killing . 'They were what everybody wanted to be - just a happy family that had everything,' she said. 'Everybody loved to be around her. She was the life of the party. She had her group of friends that stayed with her every night to get her through this when Rob died. I’m just in shock.' Hearn had worked for the Redlands Fire Department since 2012 and was active at the time of his arrest, Carl Baker with the Redlands Police Department told KTLA. Redlands Fire Chief Jeff Frazier told the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin that his department learned about the arrest on Tuesday afternoon and Hearn was immediately placed on accrued leave. He was not placed on administrative leave, which could cost the city more money, Frazier said. Both are due in court Thursday in Bakersfield.","Jonathan Michael Hearn and Sabrina Limon were arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of murder in the death of her husband .

"More than a third of bus stops used by the UK's main coach operator cannot accommodate wheelchair users - despite National Express specifically altering its fleet in order to carry them. National Express, the country's largest coach operator, stops at almost 1,200 bus stops across the country. But of those 436 bus stops - 37 per cent - have so many restrictions in place that coach drivers are prevented from using their lifts to let wheelchair users on and off the bus. More than a third of bus stops used by the UK's main coach operator cannot accommodate wheelchair users - pictured is a National Express coach which has a special wheelchair lift . The Department for Work and Pensions say as a result many disabled people are left unable to use the coaches - despite National Express and many other coach companies investing in the new, accessible buses. The majority of bus and coach stations and bus stops are owned by local authorities, which have a legal responsibility to comply with the Equality Act by making reasonable adjustments for disabled travellers. Now the minister for disabled people, Mark Harper, is leading calls for councils to make bus stations and stops more accessible to disabled travellers. Minister for disabled people, Mark Harper, is leading calls for councils to make bus stations . He said: 'It is simply unacceptable that in the 21st century more is not being done to make coach stations and stops more accessible to disabled travellers. 'There is little point in making sure buses themselves are accessible, if those who operate the places where people are collected from are not doing what they can to help. 'This isn't just about doing what's right, it's also about recognising the business case – as disabled people and their households have an annual spending power of £200 billion.' All of National Express' 550 vehicles are wheelchair accessible – meaning they can carry wheelchair users at the front of their coaches. National Express managing director Tom Stables said: 'We carry millions of passengers every year and are absolutely committed to getting people where they want to go, whatever their circumstances.' 'We passionately believe everyone has the right to travel  - that's why we were the first coach company to introduce a wheelchair lift. 'While we're really proud of our accessibility record, we still believe there's a long way to go in the field of accessible travel. 'We've worked with partners and lobbied to make third-party stations and bus stops more accessible for years and while the situation has improved, over a third of stops are still not accessible to wheelchair users. 'We hope that with the backing of the government that more station and bus stop owners will listen and take action in this crucial area.' The government has welcomed statistics, which show 84 per cent of buses and coaches in England meet new regulations that make them properly accessible to disabled people – ahead of a deadline by 2020 . Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said: 'It is unacceptable if disabled people are unable to take advantage of a service that is there to provide for everyone. 'Access to public transport has a massive impact on people's quality of life. 'We have made progress but I am determined to do more. 'This government has given £600 million to local sustainable transport projects, many of which contain measures to improve accessibility and in 2012 we published an action plan to drive improvements across the transport network.' National Express coaches all have a lift which requires a clear space for a three-metre extension from the side of the coach to allow a wheelchair to be lifted aboard. In many stations or bus stops furniture and objects which overhang mean wheelchair users who are hoping to travel are left unable to board. The government has said it welcomes latest statistics, which show 84 per cent of buses and coaches in England meet new regulations that make them properly accessible to disabled people – ahead of a deadline by 2020.

"Britain should leave the European Union if David Cameron's attempts at reform fail, a senior Tory Cabinet minister said last night. Conservative policy chief Oliver Letwin revealed that he would back exit without significant changes to the UK's the relationship with the 'United States of Europe'. It is the strongest signal yet from a senior Conservative that the Prime Minister's hopes of renegotiation could be rebuffed by other European leaders, making it more likely that the UK quits altogether. Conservative policy chief Oliver Letwin suggested there was a one in five chance that the Prime Minister's renegotiation strategy will fail, at which point he would recommend leaving the EU in a referendum . Mr Cameron has promised to claw back powers from Brussels before holding an in/out vote referendum by 2017, if he is still in power after the 2015 general election. To date the Prime Minister has carefully avoided stating what he would do if the renegotiation fails, only saying he would be clear about whether to vote to stay or leave. However, Mr Letwin suggested there was a one in five chance of failure, at which point he would recommend leaving the EU. Mr Letwin, who attends Cabinet meetings, is reported by the Huffington Post website to have told students that he would not accept the UK being 'absorbed into a United States of Europe'. Calling for substantial powers over borders and justice to be repatriated, the author of the 2010 Tory general election manifesto said: 'If we can achieve that in negotiations then I shall certainly be supporting remaining within it in the referendum in 2017. 'We have to have that referendum. We have to put to the British people that question. We will see whether what we are able to negotiate is acceptable. I think they deserve that choice. 'If we don't get the sort of position that I was describing then I wouldn't want to recommend staying, I would want to recommend leaving. It's better than being absorbed into a United States of Europe.' David Cameron has promised to claw back powers from Brussels before holding an in/out vote referendum by 2017, if he is still in power after the 2015 general election . Asked about Mr Cameron's chances of success, Mr Letwin replied: 'Certainly not 100 per cent. I can't guarantee it. Better than 50/50. I don't know what the chances are, but I think they are more like 80/20 than 20/80.' There was a 'very strong chance' that other member states would 'cut us enough slack in negotiations' to produce something to satisfy UK voters, he said. Mr Cameron has pledged to put freedom of movement at the heart of the talks with EU leaders, something other countries have already rejected. He pledged to put freedom of movement at the heart of the talks with EU leaders. Senior Tories have suggested that unless the UK can extract a better deal from Brussels, it would be better to leave than remain in an unreformed institution. However this week Steffen Kampeter, Germany's deputy finance minister, said it would be a 'catastrophe' if the UK severed ties with Brussels, including bringing 'disadvantages' for the British economy. He told BBC2's Newsnight that Germany will 'find ways' to keep Britain in the European Union, including curbing migrants claiming benefits. Asked about whether Mr Cameron would join Mr Letwin in backing an EU exit if his renegotiation failed, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'You have heard the Prime Minister's view on a number of occasions. It has not changed.'","Oliver Letwin predicts there is a 1 in 5 chance of not getting powers back .

"Outrage: Abdul Al-Faisal, 19, was given a caution after breaking into his school to retrieve his hat . Police have wiped the record of a teenager with Down's Syndrome who visited his school on a bank holiday to find his favourite hat after 120,000 people signed an online petition. Abdul Al-Faisal, 19, set off an alarm in May by climbing through a window at Haringey Sixth Form Centre in Tottenham, north London, where he had left his basketball cap in a classroom. His panicked mother Roshina, who reported him missing, then discovered to her horror that he had been arrested and was in a cell 'confused and in tears... without shoes'. She said he remained at Wood Green police station for nine hours before signing a formal caution for burglary. This was an admission of guilt which remained on the record of the teenager, who his mother said has a mental age of between 10 and 12. Ms Al-Faisal promptly complained to the Metropolitan Police, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and her local MP David Lammy. But it was an online petition which drew headlines as 120,000 people expressed their outrage over how Abdul was treated. The petition, started by the teenager's mother, said: 'He left the house without us realising, and he walked to his school. 'We called police to report him missing after searching streets near our home for two hours, and we were horrified to learn he had been arrested. 'I went to the police station and found my son confused and in tears in a cell without his shoes or coat. 'His fingerprints had been taken, he had been swabbed for DNA and his details had been put on record. The Met Police have now wiped the teenager's caution and DNA from their database, Ms Al-Faisal said. Police have now also offered an appointment for Abdul to meet police officers because he has been 'terrified' of them since the incident, she added. Security: Abdul climbed through a window at Haringey Sixth Form Centre (above), setting off an alarm . Abdul's mother wrote: 'We are very happy with this result! 'We are grateful to all those who took time out to sign our petition and support us and Abdulkarriem, in other ways. It made a massive difference, we know that for a fact.' An IPCC spokesman said the incident was referred to the watchdog, but it was decided an independent probe was not needed and the Met Police would carry out an internal review instead. Carol Boys, chief executive of the Down’s Syndrome Association, said: 'The Down’s Syndrome Association is delighted to hear that Abdul Al-Faisal has had his police record wiped. We would like to take this opportunity to extend an invitation to Police Forces across the country to take advantage of our extensive training programme.' MailOnline has contacted the Met Police for comment.","Abdul Al-Faisal, 19, was held in police station for nine 'terrifying' hours .

"Fed up: Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart said she would block the port if it was legal to do so . The mayor of Calais today threatened to shut down the port unless Britain sorts out the illegal migrant problem. Natacha Bouchart said she was sick of the numbers queuing up in northern France to try and sneak across the Channel. ‘I could take the decision to block the port,’ she said, following a meeting with Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve in Paris. ‘I could bring pressure to bear. It would be illegal, but today I want to make a strong gesture towards the British.’ She said that the UK ‘is considered an Eldorado’ by migrants, because of its generous benefits culture. Ms Bouchart also attacked the British for not contributing enough money to security at Calais port. She said she had not discussed the possibility of blocking the port with Mr Cazeneuve, because she knew he could not legally back the measure. ‘But I told him that I hoped he would have some strong negotiations with the British’, said Ms Bouchart. Earlier Cazeneuve ignored the pleas of Bouchart for a hostel for those determined to get to the UK as a solution to the immigration crisis blighting the port. Mme Bouchart blames Britain’s generous welfare and asylum systems for attracting a stream of migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East which have brought havoc to the streets of Calais. M Cazeneuve dismissed the call for a base for the migrants – likened to the notorious Red Cross camp at Sangatte used by thousands as a launch pad to Britain before it was closed in 2002 . Authorities are struggling to maintain order with up to 2,000 UK-bound migrants living in makeshift camps and squats around the town. Armed gangs fight for control of the best vantage point from which to break into trucks boarding ferries to Dover – on Saturday alone police found 300 stowaways hidden in lorries. But M Cazeneuve dismissed the call for a base for the migrants – likened to the notorious Red Cross camp at Sangatte used by thousands as a launch pad to Britain before it was closed in 2002 – even before a meeting with Mme Bouchart in Paris began. He said: ‘I don’t want to create a shelter that would be a hub for migrants.

And last night the creation of ‘welcome centres’ offering advice to the thousands of migrants who pass through France as they head for the UK moved a step closer – with calls for them to be funded by the British Government.

"It sounds like a fanciful storyline from Radio 4’s soap The Archers. A farmer’s wife sets up a campaign against her husband’s plan to erect 40,000 solar panels on their land, and even threatens to leave him. However, this everyday tale of country folk is not fiction but a real-life marital dispute between Sue Young, 69, and her husband Robert, 70. Scroll down for video . At war: Farmer's wife Sue Young has threatened to leave her husband Robert if his plans to install 40,000 solar panels on their land is approved - and she's been rallying the locals for support . She is so appalled by the farmer’s planning application to create a 55-acre solar farm that she has written an open letter to villagers asking them to join her fight against the proposal. It echoes a current storyline in The Archers in which long-suffering wife Jennifer Aldridge has angered her greedy farmer husband Brian by going to a public meeting about a controversial new road he supports. But Mrs Young appears to be taking matters considerably more seriously, not only spearheading the campaign against her husband’s plan with a solar power firm, but threatening to leave him. She told the Daily Mail: ‘My husband signed the deal without telling me. I was killing myself working 20 hours a day lambing and he conducted the negotiation behind my back. ‘We live in a beautiful valley and we won’t be able to see it if there are solar panels surrounded by 8ft-high fences. And it may all go out of fashion. It’s not been a happy situation – I’d like to kill him. I’ve not kicked him out of the bedroom, though. We’re too old for all that anyway.’ Sue Young has written an open letter to the people of Lingfield asking them to back her in her fight to oppose the plans by her husband Robert to erect the 55-acre solar farm on the family land . Mr Young said last night his wife’s stance had caused trouble for the whole family and left him deeply upset. The row has divided the village of Lingfield in Surrey, where the Youngs run Barrow Green Farm. Mr Young says he wants to build a secure financial future for his children and grandchildren with the solar panel scheme, which would supposedly provide enough energy for 3,500 households over at least 30 years. It is claimed it could earn £55,000 a year in government subsidies alone, but Mrs Young is bitterly opposed to it. Despite seeking the help of a cardiologist for angina since the proposals came to light, she insists she is determined to fight the plans. In an open letter to the East Grinstead Courier, her local newspaper, she thanked those supporting the campaign against ‘this potential blight to our countryside’ and urged villagers to write to Piers Mason, the chief planning officer at Tandridge district council. She wrote: ‘I am still asking myself: “What have I done to lead my husband to put money before our marriage?” Over the course of a year, the solar panels on Park Farm, next to the Young's family home on Barrow Green Farm, would generate enough renewable energy to power 3,500 houses (stock picture) I’m married to my husband. But I am my own person. All the stress has made me quite ill, but everyone I meet says it’s fabulous that I’m sticking to my beliefs. If the solar farm goes ahead, I’ve told him I’ll leave.’ She noted that three of their four grown-up children, who have all left home, were not interested in taking over the farm. Mrs Young said: ‘Only my daughter Louise is interested. She comes down from Cheshire to help me with the lambing.’ Mr Young, meanwhile, insisted the children supported his scheme and said it made financial sense. He said: ‘The whole thing has caused trouble in the family. It has been very stressful. I don’t want to upset her any more than she wants to upset me. ‘It was never my intention to cause friction. It’s a business decision that the farm needs to make for future generations. It will also be wildlife friendly.’ He added: ‘I don’t know whether Sue will leave me if the plan goes ahead or not. I would not have undertaken this decision if I didn’t have the backing or interest of my children. ‘But Sue is against it. She thinks she will be able to see it from her bedroom window and it will spoil her view.’ Other locals opposing the scheme include former Formula One world champion John Surtees, whose house overlooks the proposed solar farm. He said: ‘I’ve been approached by solar companies wanting to build solar farms on my land, but on principle I am against commercial ventures on fields which could be used as farmland.’","Sue Young has said she will leave husband Robert over the plans .

"There have been a lot of attempts to win the title of cheesiest 2015 calender. But with six weeks still to go until January 1, a group of French women have swooped in and stolen the crown. All it took was... well, some lumps of actual cheese. It's 10th birthday of the Calendrier des From Girls (Cheese Girls calendar). Every month has a scantily clad woman posing with a piece of cheese . The Calendrier des From Girls (Cheese Girls calendar) is celebrating a decade of existence this year, with their 2015 offering marking ten years since the first was published. Every month features a scantily-clad woman posing in a suggestive manner with a piece of cheese. The dairy products range from goats cheese to Camembert and are featured on the month when they are traditionally produced the most. The calendar costs €19 (£15.18) plus postage and packing, with proceeds going to L'Association Fromages de Terroirs (The Association Of Regional Cheeses). The month of June features the Mothais goat cheese, which was was first made in the Deux-Sevres region, where it is still produced on the farms . The month of July features Banon AOP - an unpasterised goat cheese made in the region around the town of Banon in Provence, south-east France . The association fights the cause of unpasteurised cheeses, as the numbers of people eating them have diminished greatly in France in recent years. The calendar is the brainchild of Véronique Richez-Lerouge, who also founded the organisation and the country's National Cheese Day. The website reads: 'The profits of sales are completely put back to the Association which militates for 12 years for the unpasteurised milk cheeses and their preservation in the French heritage.' Camembert is the star cheese for March. It is is Normandy's most famous cheese, which takes its name from the village near Vimoutiers, in the Orne region . Mimolette is a cheese traditionally produced around the city of Lille, France. Cheese mites are intentionally used on the outside of the cheese to create extra flavour - this process led o the US banning the product . The website continues: 'Your contribution is precious to help us to follow our fight against the standardization. 'Farmers and producers continue to make some cheese in the respect for the product and for the values. 'Those need your support and there is only you, as consumer, who can act.' Neufchâtel is the cheese for February. It is one of the oldest cheeses in France and is thought to date back to the 6th century .

"Aware that News of the World staff might use their final edition to fire a parting shot at her, Rebekah Brooks is said to have instructed two senior executives to read the paper with a ‘fine-tooth comb’. According to sources, they received the simple instruction to ‘ensure there were no libels or any hidden mocking messages of the chief executive’ of News International. However, while the news pages may have been sanitised of any subliminal messages, the proofreaders appear to have failed to spot some less subtle jibes in the crossword section. Crossword crossfire: The News of the World puzzle page appeared to contain several parting shots at Rebekah Brooks and News International bosses despite two senior Sun journalists allegedly being asked to proofread it . Among the clues in the ‘Quicky’ puzzle were: ‘Brook’, ‘stink’, ‘catastrophe’, ‘digital protection’, ‘cease’, ‘lamented’, ‘servant’ and ‘prestige’. The Cryptic Crossword was perhaps even more sardonic, with clues including: ‘Criminal enterprise, ‘mix in prison’, ‘string of recordings’, ‘will fear new security measure’. Also among them was the hint ‘woman stares wildly at calamity’ – which may refer to the photograph of Mrs Brooks’s stony-faced departure from the News International HQ in Wapping, East London, on Thursday after staff were told the Rupert Murdoch-owned paper would be shut down. Answers printed on page 47 counted: ‘Deplored’, ‘stench’, ‘stir’, ‘disaster’ ‘menace’, ‘desist’, ‘racket’ and ‘tart’. Also there was ‘firewall’, which may have referred to the anger felt by NotW journalists after internet access was blocked by bosses for ‘operational reasons’. A source at the paper told MailOnline: ‘Rebekah tried everything to stop the staff having the last word and she utterly failed.

Waiting TV cameramen and photographers captured the emotional scene as nearly 200 journalists walked out of Wapping and into an uncertain future. Mr Myler, who has edited the paper since Andy Coulson’s reign ended in 2007, said: 'As you can see this is the latest and last News of the World.' He went on: 'It is the 8,674th edition after 168 years. Its not a position that any editor would want, to close a title and, of course, I didn't close it. 'I want to pay tribute to these wonderful team of people here who after a very difficult day have produced a wonderful paper.

Every day, the 88-year-old widower from Shreveport, Louisiana eats his breakfast at the same restaurant and places a photograph of his wife, Billy Mae, on the counter. 'I bring her with me everywhere I go,' he told KSLA. 'I never go anywhere without my precious wife.'

Love story: Travis, left, was newly divorced when he asked a friend to set him up on a blind date nearly 50 years ago - and he said he was blown away when he was set up with the beautiful Billy Mae, right . Happy together: The couple married and went on to have a successful shoe business in Shreveport . But in July 2013, he was by her side to watch her take her final breaths and pass away following an illness. She was 83. 'It was the hardest thing that's ever happened to me,' he said. He said he now looks forward to the time they can be together again. 'I miss being able to put my arms around her,' he told KSLA. His story was shared by other customers who started noticing him at the counter with his wife's picture each morning. Some have even offered to pay for his meal. Loved: Travis, who has four great-grandchildren, said she always made him feel important and loved . Missed: He is pictured beside his wife's grave and said he looks forward to being reunited with her one day . The channel reported that Mr Travis suffered a heart attack last week but is doing well and hopes to return to the restaurant with Billy Mae's picture soon. His story comes after a photo of another widower dining alone at an In-N-Out Burger in October with just a picture of his late wife was shared across the internet. The man, John Silva, told MailOnline that he visits the grave of his wife, Hilda, nearly every day. She passed away in 2009. 'I was a lucky man to marry the girl I loved,' he said.

"Sudanese mother Meriam Ibrahim who escaped the death penalty for marrying a Christian today said she will start a new life in the U.S. 'like a real family' and 'trust in God as I always have done'. In her first comments since arriving in Italy after her ordeal at the hands of the barbaric Sudanese authorities, Meriam said: 'Thanks to God we are all fine. I trusted God from the first instant. I knew that he would not abandon me.' It also emerged today that Meriam only learned that she would leave Sudan just two hours before she boarded the plane to Rome after months of behind-the-scenes diplomatic wrangling. Scroll down for video . Meriam Ibrahim holds her baby girl Maya at Ciampino's military airport after flying in from Khartoum . Meriam . Ibrahim meets Pope Francis  with her daughter Maya in her arms,  in his . Santa Marta residence, at the Vatican. The Christian mother was put on . death row for refusing to become a Muslim . When Meriam, a trained doctor, landed with her husband, Daniel Wani and their two children yesterday they were given an audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican. He blessed Meriam and her baby daughter, Maya, who she gave birth to on a prison floor two months ago. Talking to Antonella Napoli, a campaigner for Italians for Darfur, Meriam said going to the Vatican was 'like a dream'. She said it was 'the peak in the faith which I have never abandoned.' She added: 'Even when they condemned me to death I never thought of renouncing my religion. When I was asked to renounce my religion I knew what I was risking. But I didn't want to do it.' Meriam, 27, said she now hopes to start a new life in the U.S. 'like a real family' in the next few days, where her husband is a U.S. citizen and lives with his brother, Gabriel, in Manchester, New Hampshire. Daniel had been in Sudan since her arrest in a bid to free his family and it cost him his job as a biochemist. Meriam had been held in a notorious women's prison, shackled and with their 21-month-old son, Martin. The toddler was not allowed to live with his Christian father because the authorities considered him a Muslim. She said: 'I will put my trust in God as I always have done. We will start a new life. My husband is a chemist but he lost his job because of my story. Now we will go and live in New Hampshire. We will all be together like a real family.' But she said she will never be able to return to Sudan, where she once owned a business. 'I will never go back,' she said. 'My family wouldn't let me.' The case drew worldwide attention in May when she was sentenced to death over charges of apostasy. A daughter of a Muslim father, Meriam was raised by her Christian mother. Ms Ibrahim and her husband, Daniel Wani, right, walk through the Vatican with the Pope . The Sudanese woman was sentenced to death in Sudan for refusing to recant her Christian faith . She married Daniel in a church ceremony in 2011. As in many Muslim nations, Muslim women in Sudan are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims, though Muslim men can marry outside their faith. By law, children must follow their father's religion. 2011: Meriam Ibrahim marries Daniel Wani after they meet when the American visits Khartoum.August . 2013: A relative alleges that her marriage to Wani, a Christian, . constitutes adultery.

Sudan's penal code forbids Muslims from converting to other religions, a crime punishable by death. The court in the capital, Khartoum, had also ordered Meriam be given 100 lashes for having sexual relations with her husband. When she asserted that she was in fact Christian she was then accused of apostasy. She was freed after months of international pressure but was initially prevented from leaving the country. In one dramatic incident she was detained at Khartoum airport by up to 40 of the Sudanese security forces. Her brother, who is believed to have brought the original case against her, publicly vowed to execute her if he had the chance. It is understood he then tried to bring a petition to make her stay in the country. Since June 26 she has been staying at the American embassy in Khartoum, where officials from Italy, the U.S. and the UK tried to secure her release. The family's escape finally came on Thursday morning when they were flown on a private jet to Rome accompanied by Italy’s Deputy Foreign Minister Lapo Pistell. Meriam's lawyer, Shareif Ali Shareif told MailOnline today: 'Meriam only learned she was to be rescued two hours before she left Sudan. She did not know where she was going. She was not told before.' Mr Ali . Shareif said the Italian government had attempted to help the persecuted . mother-of-two to flee Sudan when she was first released from jail in . June. But their efforts were thwarted by hardliners within the Sudanese . authorities who refused to let her go. Mr Ali Shareif said: 'It was a political initiative between the Italian and the Sudanese governments. 'When . Meriam was released from jail they tried to get her out of the country . then. But the rescue attempt was not successful so the negotiations with . the Sudanese authorities continued. 'Meriam only learned about this when she got on to the plane. She was not involved in the negotiations at all. 'She was very happy to be finally leaving Sudan. It has been very difficult for Meriam and her family. 'We didn't dare believe it was actually going to happen until the plane took off. Then we were celebrating.' The Vatican said Pope Francis had 'a very affectionate' meeting with Meriam her husband and their two small children. Meriam .

"Teachers on a school trip to Spain repeatedly got drunk and fought in front of the children, it has been claimed. Scared pupils from Stanley Park High sent frantic text messages to their parents complaining that staff were out of control. Four teachers are alleged to have had regular drunken nights out in Lloret de Mar – one suffering a black eye in a foul-mouthed scrap with a colleague. Teachers from Stanley Park High School (above) in Carshalton allegedly became involved in a drunken brawl wihle they were supposed to be looking after children on a trip to Spain . Another staff member has been accused . of abandoning a sick child, leaving her without medication, to go out . drinking in the resort. Seventy-five . boys and girls aged between 12 and 16 had paid £700 each to take part . in seven-day sports tour, playing a series of football and netball . matches on the Costa Brava during half term last month. The . pupils – from Carshalton in south London – visited the PortAventura . theme park and Barcelona FC’s home ground. News of the teachers’ late-night antics in the resort, known for excessive drinking and bad . behaviour, reached school authorities only after the party arrived home. Now parents have demanded that the school dismiss the teachers alleged to have been involved in the bad behaviour. Claims: At least one teacher reportedly got injured in the fracas on the sports tour to Barcelona (pictured) One, . who asked not to be named, said last night: ‘My child sent me a text . message saying how scared she was to go to sleep because there were . drunk teachers fighting. ‘She . said they were all teachers and were calling each other very rude . words. They hit each other and the students were very scared. One . teacher came away with a black eye. ‘There . was another girl who wasn’t very well on the trip and they couldn’t . find the teacher who had their medication because they had gone . drinking! ‘They should not . be going out and getting drunk when they have 75 children in their care. As for the fighting, you think they would know better.’ Staff . at the Samba Hotel in Lloret de Mar confirmed the teachers had been . badly behaved. One worker told the Daily Mail: ‘The night staff know all . about the goings-on.’ Another . parent said: ‘This has come at a bad time for staff relations at the . school. Teachers took part in the NUT strike recently and that caused a . bit of friction with the head.’ The trip is believed to have been led by . seven members of staff from the school’s performance department, which . specialises in drama, dance, media, music and physical education. Allegations of bad and inappropriate behaviour have been levelled at four of the seven. The head of the department, Paul Stapleton, has declined to comment. Mel . Kermally, business manager at Stanley Park High, said: ‘The school has . taken all matters very seriously and we have been conducting a thorough . and detailed investigation upon the return trip into the allegations . made.’ The school last night refused to confirm whether any members of staff had been suspended or sacked. A state-funded mixed-sex comprehensive, Stanley Park has 1,093 pupils aged 11 to 19. A . damning Ofsted inspection last year found the school ‘requires . improvement’, mainly because pupils had achieved lower than average GCSE . grades year after year. Inspectors highlighted concerns about teachers’ abilities, criticising marking and lesson planning. The report concluded: ‘The progress made by students in English and mathematics in 2011 and 2012 was not good enough.’","'At least one teacher injured in fracas on sports tour to Barcelona'

"Rings in fossilised pine trees have proven that the world was much warmer than previously thought - with measurements dating back to 138BC . How did the Romans grow grapes in northern England? Perhaps because it was warmer than we thought. A study suggests the Britain of 2,000 years ago experienced a lengthy period of hotter summers than today. German researchers used data from tree rings – a key indicator of past climate – to claim the world has been on a ‘long-term cooling trend’ for two millennia until the global warming of the twentieth century. This cooling was punctuated by a couple of warm spells. These are the Medieval Warm Period, which is well known, but also a period during the toga-wearing Roman times when temperatures were apparently 1 deg C warmer than now. They say the very warm period during the years 21 to 50AD has been underestimated by climate scientists. Lead author Professor Dr Jan Esper of Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz said: ‘We found that previous estimates of historical temperatures during the Roman era and the Middle Ages were too low. ‘This figure we calculated may not seem particularly significant, however it is not negligible when compared to global warming, which up to now has been less than 1 deg C.’ In general the scientists found a slow cooling of 0.6C over 2,000 years, which they attributed to changes in the Earth’s orbit which took it further away from the Sun. The study is published in Nature Climate Change. It is based on measurements stretching back to 138BC. The finding may force scientists to rethink current theories of the impact of global warming . Professor Esper's group at the Institute of Geography at JGU used tree-ring density measurements from sub-fossil pine trees originating from Finnish Lapland to produce a reconstruction reaching back to 138 BC. In so doing, the researchers have been able for the first time to precisely demonstrate that the long-term trend over the past two millennia has been towards climatic cooling. Professor Esper said: 'Such findings are also significant with regard to climate policy, as they will influence the way today's climate changes are seen in context of historical warm periods.’ The annual growth rings in trees are the most important witnesses over the past 1,000 to 2,000 years as they indicate how warm and cool past climate conditions were. Researchers from Germany, Finland, Scotland, and Switzerland examined tree-ring density profiles. In the cold environment of Finnish Lapland, trees often collapse into one of the numerous lakes, where they remain well preserved for thousands of years. Global cooling: It is the first time that researchers have been able to accurately measure trends in global temperature over the last two millennia . The annual growth rings in trees are the most important witnesses over the past 1,000 to 2,000 years as they indicate how warm and cool past climate conditions were . The density measurements correlate closely with the summer temperatures in this area on the edge of the Nordic taiga; the researchers were thus able to create a temperature reconstruction of unprecedented quality. The reconstruction provides a high-resolution representation of temperature patterns in the Roman and Medieval Warm periods, but also shows the cold phases that occurred during the Migration Period and the later Little Ice Age. In addition to the cold and warm phases, the new climate curve also exhibits a phenomenon that was not expected in this form.","Study of semi-fossilised trees gives accurate climate reading back to 138BC .

"A businessman accused of trying to deprive his former wife of a huge payout gave his pole dancer girlfriend £250,000-worth of shares in his company. Multi-millionaire Christopher Nightingale left his wife for the Moroccan after meeting her in a seedy Soho strip club and getting her pregnant, the Daily Mail has learnt. He then supported her right to remain in the UK and claimed his ex-wife, Sally, was no longer entitled to the £1.6million promised to her from a share sale – and instead cut it to just £83. Affair: Sally Nightingale (left) challenged an offer of just £83 - while Massahine Bojji (right) was handed shares . Settlement: Mrs Nightingale lives in the Grade I listed Appleby Castle in Cumbria, pictured . Mrs Nightingale has since taken her husband of 25 years to the High Court in London, claiming he has ‘piles of cash’. Yesterday, the pair reached a confidential out-of-court settlement after five hours of private negotiations. Mr Justice Mostyn told them: ‘I’m pleased that you have settled the case, and I hope that you’re able to move forward with your lives now.’ Mahassine Bojji was introduced to the 55-year-old tycoon after he paid her £500 for a private dance at the Windmill lap-dancing club in London’s West End in 2007. Tycoon: Christopher Nightingale, 55, offered his ex-wife Sally just £83 from a shares deal . Mr Nightingale, a former lawyer based in Singapore who has a chateau in France, became besotted with Miss Bojji – known as Kelly – and set her up in a luxury home in west London while still married. She fell pregnant and gave birth to their son, Faris, now five, in February 2009. Mr Nightingale divorced his wife a year later. Mrs Nightingale now lives in Grade I listed Appleby Castle, set in 29 acres of grounds in Cumbria, which she received as part of her divorce settlement. He said: ‘I had effectively lived separately from Sally for a long time, with Sally living in England and myself living in Singapore. I met Kelly in 2007, after my marriage had already broken down.’ In the same year he got divorced Mr Nightingale gave Miss Bojji, who is in her early 30s, 42,318,000 shares in his company Alternative Energy, registered in Singapore, worth around £252,000 at the time. The High Court heard how the financial aspects of the divorce appeared to have been settled in 2009 but Mrs Nightingale, 54, was still due a sum from the sale of shares in Citadel100, a Dublin computer systems firm her husband helped to found. In emails last July he told her she would receive more than £1.6million, almost a quarter of the £6.6million sale price for the shares. But he cut her payout to just £83 after claiming that he received only £330 because the sale had been ‘very hard work’ and more complicated than expected. In December, the High Court froze his British assets, and in a hearing in January a judge criticised Mr Nightingale for making such vastly different offers. It is not known how much money Mrs Nightingale will receive as a result of yesterday’s settlement. Mr Nightingale said his ex-wife, whom he has three children with, didn’t appreciate money as she’s ‘never had to work’. And he denied that Miss Bojji was an exotic dancer, saying: ‘Kelly is a bright and intelligent lady and as far as I am aware she has never been a pole dancer.’ Court fight: Sally Nightingale with her son Eddie at her Grade I listed home in Cumbria, Appleby Castle . He said he had given her shares in his company, saying ‘she is after all the mother of my child’, but said the shares were currently suspended from trading and therefore not worth anything. He also said his ex-wife was entitled to shares in the company. ‘Sally actually got a settlement worth many millions when we broke up,’ he said. ‘I was generous in order to enable Sally to retain the castle, where I hope she can enjoy a good quality of living. She and the children love it and if we had fought over it she would have had to sell it.’ Mrs Nightingale had previously said that she needed the payout to pay for the upkeep of Appleby Castle. ‘I’m not greedy,’ she said. ‘I’m asset rich but cash poor.’ Mr Nightingale, a qualified lawyer, claimed he did not even have the money to pay his lawyers.","Christopher Nightingale cut payout to ex-wife Sally from an initial £1.6m .

"Two teenagers have been found guilty of stabbing a young father to death at a birthday party after he intervened in a fight to protect his friend. Connor Barrett, 20, was stabbed in the chest and back while at a party in Hemsby, Norfolk, after a large group of uninvited guests turned up and began causing trouble. Jesse Quaye, 18, and a 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were found guilty of murdering Mr Barrett, who had a young son, at Norwich Crown Court today. Connor Barrett, 20 (left), died after being stabbed in the chest and back at a birthday party while trying to defend a friend. Jesse Quaye, 18 (right) and a 15-year-old have been found guilty of murder . Mr Barrett's mother, grandmother and aunt issued a statement saying: 'Today we received some justice for Connor. 'It has not brought us any pleasure, just relief to know that horrific part of our lives is coming to a close. 'Our life sentence began at 12.25am on May 11 and we will never have the opportunity of parole. Our grief will remain with us all forever.' Mr Barrett, from Great Yarmouth, had been DJ-ing at the 21st birthday part when a large group, who had seen the event posted on social media, arrived. Anthony McLean, 41, was found guilty of helping Quaye to avoid justice by driving him to London in the hours after the attack . A fight broke out and Mr Barrett intervened to try and protect a friend when he was stabbed. Police were called and found him with serious injuries to his chest and back. He died later in hospital. Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Paul Durham described Mr Barrett as a 'popular lad'. He added: 'He could not have foreseen the end result when he went to protect one of his friends on what was meant to be a happy occasion. 'This is a genuinely appalling way to resolve any situation and has resulted in a young man's life being cut short with untold pain and grief for his family and friends. 'His murder sent shockwaves through the small and close knit community and police received overwhelming support from local people which I have, no doubt, has helped to bring his killers to justice today.'

"Riots broke out across Egypt yesterday in protest against President Mohammed Mursi’s ‘seizure’ of sweeping new powers. A day after Mr Mursi declared that the president’s decisions could not be revoked, even by the judiciary, tens of thousands of pro-democracy activists converged on Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Mr Morsi's opponents threw molotov cocktails at a police van and set fire to Muslim Brotherhood offices in the Suez Canal cities of Suez, Port Said and Ismailia. Violence also erupted between rival factions across the country. Anger: Fires were started at Muslim Brotherhood offices across Egypt including in the port city of Alexandria, pictured .

Flames: Protesters threw a molotov cocktail at a police van during clashes at Tahrir Square in Cairo this evening triggered by the president's new powers . Critics of Morsi accused him of seizing dictatorial powers with the decrees that make him immune to judicial oversight and give him authority to take any steps against 'threats to the revolution' - . rules that rights groups say are like 'emergency laws.' The president spoke before a crowd of his supporters massed in front of his palace and said his edits were necessary to stop a 'minority' that was trying to block the goals of the revolution. 'There are weevils eating away at the nation of Egypt,' he said, pointing to old regime loyalists he accused of using money to fuel instability and to members of the judiciary who work under the 'umbrella' of the courts to 'harm the country'. But the move has divided the country and . people for and against the reforms made by the Islamist president have . gathered in places such as Tahrir Square in Cairo and near the presidential . palace. In the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, anti-Morsi crowds attacked Brotherhood backers coming out of a mosque, raining stones and firecrackers on them. The Brothers held up prayer rugs to protect themselves and the two sides pelted each other with stones and chunks of marble, leaving at least 15 injured. The protesters then stormed a nearby Brotherhood office. In the capital Cairo, security forces pumped volleys of tear gas at thousands of pro-democracy protesters clashing with riot police on streets several blocks from Tahrir Square. Tens of thousands of activists massed in Tahrir itself, angered at the decisions by Morsi. Many of them represent Egypt's upper-class, liberal elite, which have largely stayed out of protests in past months but were prominent in the streets during the anti-Muabrak uprising that began Jan. 25, 2011. Protesters chanted, ""Leave, leave"" and ""Morsi is Mubarak ... Revolution everywhere.' 'We are in a state of revolution. He is crazy of he thinks he can go back to one-man rule,"" one protester at Tahrir, Sara Khalil, said of Morsi. 'This decision shows how insecure and weak he is because he knows there is no consensus.' 'If the Brotherhood's slogan is ""Islam is the solution"" ours is ""submission is not the solution"",' said Khalil, a mass communications professor at the American University in Cairo. 'And this is Islamic because God does not call for submission to another man's will.' Protest: Egyptian opponents of President Mohamed Morsi break into the office of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, in the city . Unrest: President Mohammed Morsi's policies are driving a wedge between religious and democracy groups in Egypt . Unrest: A man shelters as missiles are thrown by rival groups during the disturbances in Alexandria . President Mohammed Morsi was only elected to the top job a matter of months ago . Riding high on US and international . praise for mediating a Gaza cease-fire, the president put himself above . oversight and gave protection to the Islamist-led assembly - writing a . new constitution from a looming threat of dissolution by court order. But the move is likely to fuel growing public anger that he and the Muslim Brotherhood are seizing too much power. In . what was interpreted by rights activists as a de facto declaration of . emergency law, one of Mr Morsi's decrees gave him the power to take 'due . measures and steps' to deal with any 'threat' to the revolution, . national unity and safety or anything that obstructs the work of state . institutions. He framed . his decisions as necessary to protect the revolution that toppled Hosni . Mubarak nearly two years ago and to cement the nation's transition to . democratic rule. Many activists, including opponents of . the Brotherhood, criticise the judiciary as packed with judges and . prosecutors sympathetic to Mr Mubarak. Brotherhood supporters accuse the . courts of trying to block their agenda. 'He . had to act to save the country and protect the course of the . revolution,' said one of Mr Morsi's aides, Pakinam al-Sharqawi, speaking on . Al-Jazeera. In a nod to . revolutionary sentiment, Mr Morsi also ordered the retrial of Mr Mubarak and . top aides on charges of killing protesters during the uprising. He also created a new 'protection of the revolution' judicial body to swiftly carry out the prosecutions. But . he did not order retrials for lower-level police acquitted of such . killings, another widespread popular demand that would disillusion the . security forces if carried out. Liberal . politicians immediately . criticised the decrees as dictatorial and destined to divide a nation . already reeling from months of turmoil following Mr Mubarak's ousting. Some claim they exceeded the powers once enjoyed by the former . president. Violence: Egyptian supporters and opponents of President Mohamed Morsi clashed in Alexandria . Opposition: Many anti-Morsi campaigners believe the president is similar to former president Hosni Mubarak . Violence: An injured protester is taken to a field hospital in Tahrir Square, Cairo, during today's protests . Mock-up: A poster depicts Morsi as a Pharaoh during a rally in Garden City, Cairo . Support: Pro-Mursi protesters chant slogans as they praise a new decree issued yesterday . Power: Mr Mursi decreed that he was above the judiciary meaning that courts will not be able to challenge his decisions . Defences: Security forces sit at a blockade in a street leading to the Egyptian parliament and Tahrir Square . 'Morsi today usurped all state powers . & appointed himself Egypt's new pharaoh,' pro-reform leader Mohamed . ElBaradei wrote on Twitter. 'A major blow to the revolution that could . have dire consequences.' Mr ElBaradei . later addressed a news conference flanked by other prominent . politicians from outside the Brotherhood - including two presidential . candidates who ran against Mr Morsi - Amr Moussa and Hamdeen Sabahi. Security and military forces were today deployed outside the key state institutions . They . pledged to cooperate to force the president to rescind his assumption of . greater powers. They called for mass protests today to demand the dissolution of the declarations. The . prospect of large rival protests involving Mr Morsi's opponents and . supporters in Cairo today raises the likelihood of clashes. Thousands from the rival camps were already out on the streets of Cairo late yesterday in an increasingly charged atmosphere. A crowd of Brotherhood supporters . massed outside the Supreme Court building and offices of the prosecutor . general - whom Mr Morsi removed in Thursday's edict. In Tahrir Square, hundreds of . demonstrators held a fourth straight day of protests against Morsi and . the Brotherhood. 'Brotherhood is banned from entry,' declared a large . banner at the protest. The . Egyptian leader decreed that all decisions he has made since taking . office in June and until a new constitution is adopted and a new . parliament is elected cannot be appealed in court or by any other . authority. Parliamentary elections are not likely before next spring. The decree also barred the courts from dissolving the controversy-plagued assembly writing the new constitution. Several courts have been looking into lawsuits demanding the panel be disbanded. Critics fear Mr Morsi and the Brotherhood are trying to marginalise women and minority Christians, . infringe on personal liberties and even give Muslim clerics a say in . lawmaking. Liberal and . Christian members withdrew from the assembly during the past week to . protest what they say is the hijacking of the process by Mr Morsi's allies. The president has extended by two months, . until February, the deadline for the assembly to produce a draft, . apparently to give members more time to iron out their differences. He . also barred any court from dissolving the Islamist-led upper house of . parliament, a largely toothless body that has also faced court cases. Criticism: Former Egyptian presidential candidate, Hamdeen Sabahi, left, and Mohamed El Baradei (right), have criticised Mr Morsi's decrees . Fears: An Egyptian protester chants slogans and holds a cross and a Quran in Tahrir Square. Many Egyptian Christians fear being marginalised by the Muslim Brotherhood . Show of force: Protests were taking place today across Cairo after noon prayers had finished . The president made most of the changes on Thursday in a declaration amending an interim constitution that has been in effect since shortly after Mr Mubarak's fall. The moves come as Mr Morsi basks in lavish praise from US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for mediating an end to eight days of fighting between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers. Clinton was in Cairo on Wednesday, when she held extensive talks with Mr Morsi. Mr Morsi not only holds executive power, he also has legislative authority after a previous court ruling just before he took office on June 30 dissolved the powerful lower house of parliament, which was led by the Brotherhood. Thursday's decisions were read on state television by his spokesman, Yasser Ali. In a throwback to the days of the authoritarian President Mubarak and his predecessors Anwar Sadat and Gamal Abdel-Nasser, the television followed up with a slew of nationalist songs.","Anger flares across country after President Mohammed Morsi issues decree which puts him 'above judicial oversight'

"Accused: Annabel Karmel, 57, fired an employee after he rejected her sexual advances and only hired good-looking men, an employment tribunal has heard . She has made millions from her wholesome image as a mother and homemaker. But Annabel Karmel has been  accused of being a sexual bully who fired an employee, 18 years her junior, when he spurned her advances. The 57-year-old, who writes books on children’s food, was alleged to have made sexual comments to Mark Salter. The 39-year-old had told an employment tribunal that she wore provocative clothing in a bid to seduce him before dismissing him last July – just four months after he joined her firm. Mrs Karmel had tried to keep the hearing secret, obtaining a gagging order preventing publication of her name, her company’s name and the name of her former employee. Her legal team argued that her reputation and status as a ‘well-known media personality’ would be irreparably damaged regardless of the outcome of the case because it involved an  allegation of sexual misconduct. But the Daily Mail successfully  challenged the order. Employment judge James Tayler ruled it was ‘patronising to the British public to assume that they are incapable of understanding that an allegation is just that until it has been proved’. The judge said ‘the fact that a hearing will involve the airing of information that is personal and embarrassing and engages the qualified right to respect for private and family life’ is not ‘sufficient to outweigh the principle of open justice’. Mrs Karmel contested all the allegations made at the four-day employment tribunal hearing in central London. And last night she agreed terms with her former sales manager following hours of legal wrangling. He withdrew his claim of sexual . misconduct as part of an undisclosed settlement. In a statement issued . through her lawyers, Mrs Karmel said: ‘Mark Salter has withdrawn his . employment tribunal claim and unreservedly retracted the allegations . against me. Writer: Karmel, who was awarded an MBE in 2006, invited 39-year-old Mark Salter abroad on work trips as a 'personal chaperone', the hearing in London was told. Above, the cookery writer with her puppy Sabre last year . Mark Salter, who was in charge of sales for the company that handles Karmel's business, brought the sexual harassment, racism and religious discrimination lawsuit against Karmel last year after he was sacked . Mr Salter, 39, claimed that resisting the married mother-of-three’s suggestive behaviour towards him - including deliberately provocative clothing and inappropriate sexual comments - had cost him his job . ‘I have defended . his claim throughout and am glad this has now been resolved. It has . been agreed that neither party will make any further comment on this . matter.’ It has been . reported that Mr Salter claimed the celebrity author ‘only employed . good-looking men’ and made inappropriate comments about his good looks . in front of clients. The Mail on Sunday reported – without identifying . either party – that Mr Salter had accused his former boss of inviting . him on two foreign work trips, which he did not attend, as her ‘personal . chaperone’ and invited him to join her on a visit to a Playboy club. Mr . Salter was also reported to have alleged that she had confided in him . that she was having an affair and once tried to set him up on a date . with a celebrity friend. Mrs . Karmel appeared at the hearing yesterday dressed in a scarlet red, . fitted jacket, black shirt, black stockings and black stiletto heels. Claims: She also allegedly tried to set him up with a celebrity friend and told him that she having an affair . At work: The allegations were revealed today after a previous reporting ban - restricting the press from identifying Karmel and Mr Salter - was lifted. Above, Karmel is pictured with Stena Line chef Chris Evans . In . between discussions with her legal team she found time to tweet . nutritional advice for babies and young children, urging mothers to . ‘keep food in large chunks’ for youngsters to hold on to. The . food guru has published 37 books, is regularly on television, radio and . in the Press and her business has expanded to include baby products and . ready meals. Mrs Karmel says she was inspired to create healthy meals . following the death of her first child, Natasha, and because of her son . Nicholas’s fussy eating habits. She has two other grown-up children. Divorced . from their father, oil broker Simon Karmel, she lives in a £20million . home in one of London’s most sought after districts with film producer . partner Stephen Margolis.

"Many people set the mood for a romantic night in with candles, but now they could use a genetically engineered glowing plant for a date with a difference. A light-producing plant called Starlight Avatar that glows like a firefly has been created by U.S. scientists. Bioengineers spliced genes from bioluminescent bacteria with a pot plant to create the plant, which can be used as a lamp in the dark. A light-producing plant called Starlight Avatar that glows like a firefly has been created by U.S. scientists. It is pictured in daylight (left) when it looks like a regular pot plant, but it can be seen to emit light in darkness . Bioglow, the company behind the innovation, which is based in St Louis, Missouri, claim Starlight Avatar is the first light-emitting plant. It is a genetically-modified version of a regular pot plant called Nicotiana alata and glows continuously during its lifetime. The firm is auctioning the first batch of glowing shrubs and taking pre-orders for further plants it is are currently nurturing. The phenomenon of living organisms . glowing in the nature is called bioluminescence. There are over twenty . independently evolved bioluminescent mechanisms found in nature as seen in glow worms, bobtail squids, deep-sea anglerfish and . bacteria. Autoluminescent plants - shrubs that produce light - are . created by introducing the light-emitting pathway from marine bacteria . into a plant's chloroplasts. The company said that its plants are . similar to fireflies. Its light emission ‘machinery’ is encoded in its cells to . let it constantly emit visible light during its life cycle of between . two and three months. ‘The glow of Starlight Avatar is best described as comparable in strength to starlight,’ the company said. It . suggests that people should appreciate the plant’s ‘dim ambient glow’ in a darkened room and it might take a few minutes for their eyes to . adjust to appreciate the effect. The plant was created by splicing genes from a bioluminescent bacteria with a pot plant, allowing bioengineers to create the plant, which can be used as a lamp (pictured) ‘After the initial glow of the plant is visible, the plant’s features and glowing parts become increasingly more prominent as the eyes continue to adjust,’the company explained. It took Dr Alexander Krichevsk, bioengineer and the founder of Bioglow, several years to make the plant prototypes, which for the first time show that plants can emit light on their own. The findings of his research were first described in the journal PLoS One in 2010 but it was not until December of last year that he announced the first commercially available glowing plant, named Starlight Avatar. Scientists have been trying to create light-emitting plants for around 30 years, but Bioglow’s creation is not painted with dye and does not rely on ultraviolet light to trigger a temporary glowing effect like previous innovations. ‘Bioglow’s plants are the first autonomously luminescent, or autoluminescent, plants that emit light on their own without the need for chemicals or UV light,’ the company claims on its website.

It aims to bring cleaner, sustainable and affordable plant-based light alternatives to the world. The plants being auctioned will be shipped in transparent boxes containing nutrient-rich gel and will grow until they fill it up, when they can be transferred to a normal plant pot. While the plant glows in its box, the company said it improves with transfer to pots due to more open access to atmospheric oxygen.","Starlight Avatar claims to be the first light-emitting plant and was made by bioengineers at Bioglow, St Louis, Missouri .

"The mysterious UFO sightings in Europe around the 1950s have been explained by (yet another) mysterious Tweet from the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA gained 35,000 followers in the first half an hour they joined Twitter last month and now have more than 630,000 followers. Now the spy agency have helped solved what was a strange series of sightings in Norway over 60 years ago. At the time Norwegians documented what they believed were alien spacecrafts soaring across the sky. Makes sense: There were a series of UFO sightings in Norway in the 1950s. But with one post on Twitter, the CIA have explained them, saying they were merely testings of U-2 reconnaissance planes, such as the one pictured . The CIA tweets an explaination for some UFO sightings in the 1950s, complete with an official document . But thanks to one tweet, the CIA have explained exactly what was happening. 'Do you remember the reports of unusual activity in the sky in the 50's? That was us,' the Tweet said. Attached to the tweet was a government writeup about the sightings, showing that they were actually test flights of U2 reconnaissance planes. The planes flew above 60,000 feet, which wasn't thought possible at the time, so commercial pilots who saw something so far above them couldn't explain it. The effect was more pronounced at different times of the day and night, and if the U2 planes caught the rays of the sun, people on the ground were able to see silvery glints of light. The U-2 is a high altitude reconnaissance aircraft that reaches altitudes above 70,000 feet . The explanation was kept classified for decades to keep the spy programme a secret from the Soviets during the Cold War, according to the BBC. It is yet another tweet that caused a social media from the CIA since they joined Twitter. The agency joined the network in June with this script: 'We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet.'","There were a number of strange sightings in the sky around Norway in the 1950s .

"He saved the lives of countless youngsters through two decades of campaigning about road safety. So when a new generation of smartphone-obsessed grown-ups began ignoring simple rules for crossing the street, there was only one solution: send for the Green Cross Code Man! Today the fearless crusader dons his big green boots again for a new drive to persuade people not to text, make calls or listen to music while crossing the street. Scroll down for video . Actor David Prowse is making a comeback as the Green Cross Man after 40 years for a new safety campaign . He played the safety superhero in the 1970s and 80s - deaths and injuries involving children dropped dramatically during the campaign, sponsored by the Department of Transport . David Prowse, who played the safety superhero throughout the 1970s and 1980s, has come out of retirement at the age of 79 to reinforce the mantra that he drummed home all those years ago: ‘Stop, look, listen, think.’ And while we’re about it – watch where you’re going instead of at your phone. Granted, our resurrected hero is not quite as sprightly as he was. But anything he can do to halt the rise in accidents is surely good news for pedestrians (not to mention any drivers who don’t fancy getting a texting 20-something on their car bonnet.) Yesterday he told me: ‘You see people wandering across the road with their eyes glued to their phones, or oblivious to what’s going on around them because they’re wearing huge headphones over their ears. In real life I can’t really walk up to people and tell them off because I’d probably get punched. But road safety is a real passion point for me, so I’m happy to help.’ The crusader dons his big green boots again for a new drive to persuade people not to text, make calls or listen to music while crossing the street . It is hoped the online 21st century version aimed at grown-ups will be as successful as the 1970 campaign . Mr Prowse, a married father of three who is also celebrated for his role as Darth Vader in Star Wars, was made an MBE by the Queen in 2000 for his contribution to road safety. Deaths and injuries involving children dropped dramatically during the campaign, sponsored by the Department of Transport, which began in 1971. Now it is hoped an online 21st century version, sponsored by MORE TH>N insurance, will have similar benefits for grown-ups. One of the new films shows a young father pushing a pram into the road between parked cars while texting. Mr Prowse has not lost his ability to scold offending pedestrians: ‘What do you think you’re doing?’ he asks, before instructing him how to cross properly. The actor still owns his trusty Droid, a small robot that helped him underline the original road safety message. (He kept it in the shed at his South London home for 30 years before a Jedi society volunteered to restore it last year.) He has also kept hold of the original outfit, although thankfully he wasn’t required to wear the improbably tight leggings he sported as a younger crusader. ‘I’m afraid I can’t get in them any more,’ he admits.","David Prowse played the safety superhero through the 1970s and 1980s .
