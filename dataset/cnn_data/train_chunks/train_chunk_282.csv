"(CNN) -- For centuries, tales of the Yeti, an elusive but terrifying creature said to roam the inhospitable Himalayan Mountains, have enthralled curious minds. Now, research by a leading UK geneticist may have unlocked the truth about the Yeti, or Abominable Snowman, after hair samples from two mystery animals proved to be a genetic match to an ancient polar bear. Artist creates faces from DNA left in public . The findings, to be explained in ""Bigfoot Files,"" a documentary series on Britain's Channel 4 TV network, are the work of Bryan Sykes, a professor of human genetics at Oxford University. He put out a worldwide call last year for people to submit hair or other tissue from ""cryptids,"" or previously undescribed species, and collected more than 30 samples for analysis. Sykes' research focused on two samples in particular, both from the Himalayas but found about 800 miles apart, one in the Ladakh region and the other in Bhutan.

To his surprise, testing found a 100% match with a polar bear jawbone from Svalbard, the northernmost part of Norway, that dates back between 40,000 and 120,000 years, according to a news release from Channel 4. What Sykes called an ""exciting and completely unexpected result"" casts new light on the Yeti legend, although it may not satisfy the legions of ""Bigfootologists"" around the world. ""There's more work to be done on interpreting the results. I don't think it means there are ancient polar bears wandering around the Himalayas,"" Sykes said. Scientists map DNA of prehistoric animal . ""But we can speculate on what the possible explanation might be. It could mean there is a subspecies of brown bear in the High Himalayas descended from the bear that was the ancestor of the polar bear. Or it could mean there has been more recent hybridization between the brown bear and the descendant of the ancient polar bear."" Sykes' DNA testing forms part of the Oxford-Lausanne Collateral Hominid Project, which is also looking for genetic evidence of other mysterious creatures -- including the Sasquatch, or Bigfoot, in the Pacific Northwest and the Almasty in Russia -- to study their possible links to humans. Those who submitted samples to the project last year were asked to give a description of the material and details of where and when it was found, as well as their own opinion of its likely species type and the reasons for that view. Watson: 'DNA was my only gold rush' The analysis, which involves sophisticated DNA testing and comparison of the findings with a database of other animals' genomes, doesn't come cheap, costing about $2,000 for each hair sample. But it may finally allow scientists to pin down whether all those Yeti or Bigfoot ""sightings"" over the years -- often captured in blurred photos or shaky video footage -- are based on fact, mistaken identity or elaborate hoaxes. Chinese researchers to relaunch 'Bigfoot' search . "" 'Bigfootologists' and other enthusiasts seem to think that they've been rejected by science,"" Sykes is quoted as saying. ""Now I think that's a complete distortion of what science is about. Science doesn't accept or reject anything. All it does is examine the evidence, and that is what I'm doing."" Sykes has submitted the DNA results for publication in a peer-reviewed science journal and is also due to publish a book based on his research next year.","Geneticist: Mystery samples from the Himalayas match an ancient polar bear jawbone .

"(CNN) -- As a mom, I can tell you what a lot of us think but don't say out loud: Mother's Day only really works as a holiday the first five years you're a mother. The first year, it's a new milestone of your life. People want to acknowledge the fact that you're a mother. It's sweet. It's like they're saying, ""Hey! Pay no attention to the fact that you're perpetually sleep deprived and will be for the next 18 years. Or that your lactating mammaries no longer belong to you and, in fact, betray you at really inopportune times. Or that beyond here only lie skeletons of your former social life. It's your day! We fete you!"" Then for the next four years or so it's really cute to be brought breakfast-in-bed with homemade crayon-on-construction-paper cards and macaroni necklaces. Oh yes, that works. That tugs on every heartstring a mom has (disregarding that it will take you five hours to clean up the kitchen it took them exactly five minutes to destroy). It's pretty much every year after that which will end up in the ""disappointing holiday"" column. You know why? Because of Hallmark cards and grocery store bouquets, prepackaged chocolates and Mother's Day brunches at overcrowded eateries (because everyone else had the same idea: ""I know! Let's take mom out for lunch and pay someone else to do for her what she has done for years for us for free!""). Those pre-packaged gifts all let mom know that her offspring know what day it is, but lack the single quality all moms love in a present: effort. That's right, good ol' sacrificial time and effort that add up to the one sentiment we're really looking for -- undying gratitude mixed with just a pinch of sorrow for our stretch marks. Good Mother's Day gifts are like geometry class where you are required to show your work in order to get credit. Moms prefer the ""effort element"" because it's the only thing that remotely begins to balance out the fact that we get blamed for a LOT. OK -- really -- just about everything: what we ate while our child was gestating, how we did/did not discipline them, whether we did not give enough hugs, read enough bedtime stories, gave too much smothering love, what we did/did not expose them to. Also, opportunities we did/did not afford them. If we helped too much with the science project, did not feed them enough protein in their formative preadolescent years, rewarded them with M&Ms during potty training which led to their carb addiction as an adult. Fill in the blank with your own mother issues. So we get 364 days of blame and one day of sorta kinda culturally mandated praise. Somehow it doesn't really balance out. But I like to think of Mother's Day in terms of a really overused buzzword (isn't ""buzzword"" an overused buzzword?) these days: ""awareness."" It's great for the mothered of the world to be aware of their gratitude for their mother (or mother figure) in their life, but I enjoy it for the awareness it brings to me. Every Mother's Day I'm reminded of what an exhausting privilege it is to get a front row seat to watch these amazing people grow from helpless infants to become people I truly love to hang out with. It's a gift to see them growing into all their gifts and talents and to watch with pride (and let's be honest -- concern) as they begin their own family units. It makes me sharply aware of what motherhood really is : 1. the hardest job you'll ever love, 2. responsibility without control, and 3. a piece of your heart walking around outside your body. And having a daughter and daughter-in-love (I call her ""daughter-in-love because it's more than just a ""law"" thing) with babies, let me tell you what most every mother would really love this Mother's Day: a kiss, a hug and a nap.","Renfroe: Mother's Day gifts are like geometry class -- you have to show your work to get credit .

"(CNN) -- New tests suggest how a contaminant in heparin -- a blood thinner -- may be connected to dozens of deaths, FDA officials said Monday. Jin Shaohong, a Chinese health official, says he doubts China is to blame for the heparin problem. The Food and Drug Administration has ""now established a mechanism by which we think this contaminant could cause these adverse events,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. She said contaminated shipments of the blood thinner have been traced from China to 10 countries, including the United States. ""Contamination of the heparin supply is a worldwide problem,"" she said. Heparin containing oversulfated chondroitin sulfate -- a compound made from animal cartilage -- has been associated with hundreds of serious adverse symptoms, including allergic reactions that cause nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath and a severe drop in blood pressure. In addition, the FDA has tallied 81 deaths related to those symptoms in the United States, though no causal link has been determined. The severe reactions seem to be related to patients who were given high doses of the drug, Woodcock said. She said she would not detail the suspected problems with the contaminant in heparin until the information is published in scientific literature and other researchers have had a chance to weigh in on the matter. Contaminated heparin has been discovered in China, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Germany and the United States. Germany and the United States are the only countries that have linked adverse events to the drug, but cases in other countries may have gone unnoticed, Woodcock said. Still, agency officials stressed Monday that they cannot be sure the deaths are linked to the drug, which is made from pig intestines and is given to prevent clot formation. ""We are not able to rule out the fact that there could be other problems leading to these adverse events,"" Woodcock said. Earlier Monday, Chinese officials said they were doubtful a contaminant in heparin was responsible for the bad reactions, according to The Associated Press. They said the contamination might have occurred in the United States during the manufacturing process or patients may have had conditions that caused the symptoms.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta explain the controversy over heparin » . ""We are aware that our Chinese colleagues are skeptical that such a link has been established,"" Woodcock said. ""We are hoping for further scientific dialogue with them in the next few weeks to present the data."" The raw ingredient for heparin sold by Baxter International and ordered recalled came from Scientific Protein Laboratories, a Wisconsin company that owns Changzhou SPL Co. Ltd. The FDA posted on its Web site a warning letter to Changzhou SPL. The letter said the company has not instituted proper safeguards to ensure the raw materials are free of impurities. ""You fail to have adequate systems for evaluating the suppliers of heparin crude materials, and the crude materials themselves to ensure that these materials are acceptable for use,"" the letter said. It also cited equipment used in the manufacture of heparin as ""unsuitable for intended use."" For example, it said, tanks used to make heparin ""were identified as clean,"" but ""unidentified material was observed adhering to the inside surfaces."" Shipments of the company's materials made at the plant will be refused admission into the United States until the matter is corrected, the letter said. ""We regret FDA's decision to send a warning letter to Changzhou SPL, and we do not believe that the warning letter reflects Changzhou SPL's actual state of compliance with current good manufacturing practices,"" SPL said in a written statement. It added that it is ""committed to cooperating with FDA and will promptly provide a detailed response."" In a written statement, Baxter said its tests confirmed that the contaminant can cause drops in blood pressure, the most commonly reported adverse event. ""That means that the contaminant, which was introduced at the workshop of consolidator level, before it reached our API [active pharmaceutical ingredient] supplier and before it reached Baxter, is likely the cause of the increased adverse reactions to the heparin,"" said Norbert Riedel, the company's chief scientific officer. Because no method existed to test for the contaminant, the FDA last month developed one, and regulators are now confident current U.S. supplies of the drug are safe, Woodcock said. It remains unclear where the contamination occurred, but the contaminated products' active pharmaceutical ingredient came from 12 Chinese makers of crude heparin ""across a broad area of China,"" she said. The most persuasive evidence implicating the Chinese product, she said, is the fact that the increased number of deaths reported after heparin administration returned to baseline in March, after the FDA recall. Though Chinese officials have raised the possibility that clean and safe heparin may have also been linked to adverse events, Woodcock discounted that. ""We tested this lot and found contamination,"" she said. ""In their testing, they did not find contamination, but we are fairly certain because of multiple labs doing the testing that this lot contains contaminants.""

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Chemical dispersants keep flowing into the Gulf of Mexico at virtually unchanged levels despite the Environmental Protection Agency's order to BP to ""significantly"" scale back, according to a CNN analysis of daily dispersant reports provided by the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command. When the May 26 directive was issued, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said dispersant use should be cut by 75 percent. Public statements at the time made by the EPA administrator gave the impression that federal officials were trying to cut down overall dispersant use. ""We expect to see a substantial reduction in the overall amount of dispersant used,"" Jackson said in May. Before May 26, BP used 25,689 gallons a day of the chemical dispersant Corexit. Since then, CNN's analysis shows, the daily average of dispersant use has dropped to 23,250 gallons a day, a 9 percent decline. Gulf Coast environmentalists say it's another sign that the federal agencies monitoring dispersant use are not being tough enough with BP. ""I think the EPA has been struggling to respond to this crisis,"" said Aaron Viles with the Gulf Restoration Network. ""It's all really a giant science experiment and we're terribly concerned that in the long run the impacts are going to be significant and we really don't know what we're doing to the ecosystem."" But the EPA argues it deserves credit for getting alarming dispersant use under control. The directive states that BP must ramp down dispersant use by ""75 percent from the maximum daily amount used."" And that's the catch. The highest recorded amount of dispersant used occurred on May 23, when 70,000 gallons were injected into the Gulf of Mexico. EPA officials say they feared that number would have become the norm and that's why, they say, the directive was issued. ""This escalation was quickly reversed, ensuring BP only uses the lowest volume of dispersant needed,"" said Adora Andy, a spokeswoman for the EPA. But even by the EPA's own standards, BP still routinely exceeds the daily threshold. The EPA and Coast Guard say they're trying to keep dispersant use to around 18,000 barrels a day. But according to CNN's analysis, BP has gone over that amount 50 percent of the time since the May 26 directive was issued. To do so, BP must request permission from the U.S. Coast Guard. Coast Guard officials say dispersant use is ""evaluated daily"" and that it's using the ""safest and most effective methods available"" to protect the sea environment. ""The EPA-Coast Guard directive has been successful in ensuring that BP uses the lowest volume of dispersant necessary,"" U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Erik Halvorson, a spokesman with the Unified Area Command. The EPA continues testing the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500, which has been used by BP since the beginning of the oil disaster. So far more than 1.6 million gallons of the chemical have been injected into the Gulf of Mexico. But the struggle over daily dispersant use has caught the eye of Rep. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, one of the loudest critics of BP's response in cleaning up the oil spill. ""I think it is obvious we can never again allow for a repetition of what is happening right now, where the science experiment is being conducted without having any idea what the impact on marine life long term will be,"" said Markey.","Chemical dispersants keep flowing at virtually unchanged levels .

"San Diego (CNN) -- As a teenager, Alli Morgan lived for sports. She was a cyclist and a climber, and she played on her high school's softball and field hockey teams. That all ended abruptly her sophomore year, the day Morgan tore a ligament in her right knee during a field hockey game. She underwent ACL surgery, expecting a quick recovery. Instead, it led to 45 more operations on her knee, months in the hospital and a diagnosis of a rare genetic disorder. At 20, Morgan faced a difficult decision: Continue to undergo more surgery or consider amputation. ""I thought of what I wanted out of life. I was on crutches for six years. I had a leg that was basically dead weight,"" she said. Morgan opted to have her leg amputated above the knee. ""This was not about a loss of a limb,"" she said. ""It was about regaining my life."" During that process, Morgan found hope in Project Athena. The organization helps women who have survived medical setbacks achieve an athletic goal, whether it is participating in a triathlon or scaling the Great Wall of China. ""Very often people are saying, 'OK, I survived. But now what?' "" said Robyn Benincasa, the nonprofit's founder. ""We want to be that now what."" Since 2009, Benincasa and her group have helped 140 women fulfill their adventurous dreams. From a setback to an 'Athenaship' A firefighter in San Diego and a 10-time Ironman, Benincasa's own life is all about adventure. But like the women she helps, she, too, is a survivor. Seven years ago, Benincasa was running in an adventure race when her leg gave out. She collapsed and dragged herself to the finish line. Shortly after, she was diagnosed with stage-four osteoarthritis in both hips, and her doctor told her she would never run again. ""I was in shock, because my body had never betrayed me before,"" said Benincasa, 47. ""I always found a way to get through whatever it was, so I pretended it wasn't happening for a little while. And then I was being rolled into surgery for my first hip replacement."" Benincasa has since had three more hip replacements, but she never let it stop her. After the first one, she was inspired by a friend to start scheduling herself in events for which she could train. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . She realized it could also be a way to help inspire other women in their recovery. ""Maybe somebody always wanted to run a 10K but got cancer, and now they need the motivation to not let that dream fade,"" she said. ""It's not about the setback, it's about the comeback."" Project Athena provides grants, called ""Athenaships,"" that pay for coaching, travel expenses, entry fees or equipment -- whatever may be needed for a woman to live her adventure. ""Being an Athena, you're not just a survivor, you're an adventurer,"" Benincasa said. ""We give them a different label to put on themselves, and it's something they become on their way to the finish line."" Women can apply for a grant to do any event they wish, or they can participate in one organized by Project Athena. The group's events include a 45-mile Grand Canyon trek and a 100-mile kayaking, cycling and hiking/running adventure in the Florida Keys. Adventure becomes them . Benincasa has found that many of the women start small and then want to do more. ""We often hear, 'What else can I do?' It gives them a whole new perspective,"" Benincasa said. ""It's not about trying to get back what you were, it's about trying to be the best of what you're capable of today, this minute."" Morgan, now 23, credits Project Athena with helping her get her life back. In 2012, she was able to participate in the group's Florida Keys adventure with the assistance of a prosthetic leg. ""It was the most incredible feeling to be surrounded by so many like-minded people, the common bond of going through something,"" Morgan said. For Benincasa, helping the women gain a sense of rebirth motivates her. ""The most gratifying thing is the moment when you see someone realize they're going to make it, when you see the fear disappear ... and they realize how awesome they are."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- It's no secret among European football fans that for many years the U.S.'s attempts to embrace football -- or soccer as they like to call it -- were treated with derision. Their players weren't as good, the sport didn't have any history, the terminology was all wrong and the commentators would get way too excited over average plays. The ill-fated North American Soccer League, with its countdown clock and refusal to accept a draw as a genuine result, was proof to everyone else that they just didn't get it. But things have changed dramatically in recent years and overseas fans are now being forced to accept that the Americans may actually get it all too well. Major League Soccer has doubled its size in less than a decade, now claiming to be the seventh most supported league in the world. And the appetite to consume the game in any way possible has boomed, with the value of Premier League TV rights packages tripling. It won't have escaped the attention of many English football fans that their teams are now owned by American investors. This week's announcement that Manchester City will become majority shareholders in the league's 20th franchise in New York City is proof that the strongest football markets are now taking the U.S. seriously. Meanwhile, City and Chelsea's post-season tour of America, coming at the end of a long and tiring year for both sides, demonstrates how important the U.S. market is becoming for Premier League teams. It's good for business when NBC, Fox and ESPN fight over the right to broadcast their games from England, but those teams have to fly over the Atlantic in order to cultivate a fan base and stoke the interest. On Thursday, City and Chelsea wowed a crowd of almost 50,000 fans in St. Louis with a seven goal thriller and on Saturday, New York fans were lining up for more of the same at Yankee Stadium. But not everyone is a big fan of these post-season tours. The players are contractually obligated but surely many of them wouldn't be here by choice. And the England manager Roy Hodgson has expressed his concern with the ever increasing demands on club players, who are exhausted by the time they show up for international duty. But there may come a time when Premier League sides aren't made to feel quite so welcome on this side of the pond. In fact, we might be there already. As Major League Soccer grows in strength and stature, franchise owners want to build and promote their own fan base. They're not going to want their own potential supporters investing financially and emotionally in clubs from thousands of miles away in London and Manchester. At least not now, not while those teams are bigger and better, with players whose star appeal is significantly brighter. But Man City might just have struck the perfect balance. By owning a team in each league, they'll have a foot in both camps. The American team will benefit from City's scouting network and player development, and club Manchester will learn from the Americans' marketing expertise and reap the financial rewards of MLS success. And in Manchester, at least, English fans will no longer be laughing at their American cousins.","The U.S. has turned into an important market in the world of soccer .

"Washington (CNN) -- The same day a documentary that featured government whistle-blower P. Jeffrey Black premiered, an Internal Revenue Service agent came to Black's door for an audit. Coincidence? Black doesn't think so. Now he's taken his story to two congressional committees and a Treasury Department watchdog, a sign that the IRS will face new scrutiny after its admission that employees improperly singled out applications for tax-exempt status by tea party groups for extra review. Black retired from the Federal Air Marshal Service in 2010 after taking complaints about his agency to Congress. Six years earlier, he testified to a closed-door hearing into his complaints of ineptitude, favoritism and problems keeping marshals on flights. The same year he retired, he appeared in ""Please Remove Your Shoes,"" a documentary critical of the airline security measures travelers endure on every trip. An IRS agent showed up at his door ""almost to the hour"" that the movie bowed, he said. ""Being a veteran of extensive retaliation in my past, I am not surprised about this,"" Black told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""It is basically the only way they can retaliate against me after I retired."" Black said his supervisors wrongly suspected he had been leaking reports of cutbacks by the service -- something for which another air marshal was later fired. He said his home was placed under surveillance, his cable lines were cut and he was taken off of flight duty to perform menial tasks around his office. ""There I was in a suit and a tie, instead of being on a plane like I should be, painting scuff marks off the wall and washing cars,"" he said. Shifting IRS polls contradict key deposition . The audit led to a yearlong investigation that included the placement of a $24,000 lien against his home. In the end, the IRS found out Black owed them $480 -- while the government owed him $8,300. Black paid his $480; the government never paid him, saying the statute of limitations had run out. After the May disclosure by the IRS that some of its employees had singled out conservative groups that had applied for tax-exempt status, resulting in lengthy delays in their applications being processed, Black wrote to the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the IRS, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He told them he now thinks someone -- perhaps the Air Marshal Service, the Department of Homeland Security or elsewhere in the Obama administration -- was using the IRS to retaliate against him. When he raised his suspicions before, ""I always received the same reply: 'The IRS would never do that -- that would be just too obvious -- you are just paranoid,' "" he told the Ways and Means Committee. But now, ""I do not believe the previous actions taken by the IRS were 'just a coincidence.'"" And Black may not be alone. The committee is now soliciting details from people who think they were targeted for their political beliefs. And he's been contacted by investigators for the Treasury Department inspector-general's office that looked into the tea party complaints, indicating that probe may be heading in a new direction. GOP tries to keep focus on IRS targeting scandal . ""They wanted to know the history of my whistle-blowing, me testifying before Congress,"" he said. ""They wanted to get a whole history of my employment with the Federal Air Marshal Service. They also wanted to find out the origin of the audits. They were very concerned with who actually pushed the button to start the audit."" In a statement issued to CNN, the IRS says federal law prohibits it from talking about the cases of specific taxpayers. But it says audits ""are based on the information contained on the tax return and the underlying tax law -- nothing else."" ""The audit process is handled by career, nonpartisan civil servants, and the IRS has processes in place to safeguard the exam process,"" the agency said. ""We strive to be vigilant in our efforts to provide the best taxpayer service and enforce the nation's tax laws with fairness and integrity."" ""While it is too early in this investigation to determine what all of the facts are, some reports received by the committee support claims the IRS was targeting taxpayers for their beliefs,"" the committee told CNN in a written statement. Black may be worried about being seen as paranoid, but at a congressional hearing focusing on the tea party issue, Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady wondered whether the IRS scandal is just beginning. ""Is this still America?"" Brady asked. ""Is this government so drunk on power that it would turn its full force, its full might, to harass intimidate and threaten an average American who only wants his voice heard?""

"Paris (CNN) -- A furnace exploded Monday at a nuclear site in France, killing one person and injuring four, a spokeswoman for French energy company EDF told CNN. There was no radioactive leak or waste released, she said. The French nuclear safety agency also said there had been no radioactive leak. The explosion happened at a center for processing and decommissioning nuclear waste, said the safety agency, which is known by its French acronym ASN. The agency has sent inspectors to the site, it said in a statement. The explosion took place in Marcoule, in southeastern France, the EDF spokeswoman said, declining to give her name in line with company policy. The building housing the furnace was not structurally damaged by the explosion, an official at the plant said. Different activities take place at the large-scale site, including research by France's Center for Atomic Energy, said a spokeswoman for Areva, a nuclear company that has operations at Marcoule. Areva dismantles nuclear facilities at the site, she said. There are no nuclear power plants in Marcoule, the spokeswoman said, declining to give her name. Weapons-grade plutonium was once produced at the site, one of the oldest nuclear facilities in the country, but France no longer produces plutonium. The location is not far from the Cote du Rhone wine region. Ed Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists in the United States said he does not know of any comparable facilities there, but he said the incident in France shows that processing even low-level nuclear waste carries some risk. The incident could affect the debate over what the U.S. does with its spent nuclear fuel, said Lyman of the nuclear watchdog group. Currently, nuclear plants store the fuel in pools and in dry casks. Some say that it should be processed for reuse, as is done in France. But Lyman said that reprocessing creates large amounts of low-level waste and that Monday's incident shows the risk of dealing with even that kind of waste. France relies heavily on nuclear power, which now accounts for about 80% of the country's electricity production, according to the U.S. State Department. The French government has been reviewing the country's dependence on nuclear energy after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima in Japan in March 2011, which was triggered by an earthquake and tsunami. There have been no serious suggestions from mainstream politicians that France reduce its dependence on nuclear power, the State Department says. CNN's Dheepthi Namasivayam, Saskya Vandoorne, Jim Bittermann, Mike Ahlers and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: The blast could affect the U.S. debate about spent nuclear fuel, an expert says .

"Yaounde, Cameroon (CNN) -- Cholera has killed 297 people in the west African nation of Cameroon, health officials said Wednesday. The outbreak, which began in May, has exceeded 3,000 cases, said Dr. Eric Mintz, the leader of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's global water sanitation and hygiene epidemiology team. The agency has an office in Cameroon. ""It's a lot of cases and a lot of deaths,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""More deaths than should be expected under the best of conditions."" Under ideal conditions, cholera's fatality rate ought to be less than 1 percent, he said. But Cameroon's conditions are not ideal. Many people live far from the medical aid that could help them rehydrate and replace the sodium and potassium lost in their stools and vomit. ""That delay can be critical,"" Mintz said. ""If you don't get the fluids and the electrolytes replaced through hydration, you can go into shock and die as a result."" The country's northern region has been particularly hard hit. Three of 10 prisoners diagnosed with cholera at Maroua Central Prison in the far north were among the dead, the officials said. CDC's Mintz said the rugged and remote region has been affected repeatedly by cholera epidemics, most recently last year. About 70 percent of people living in the country's far north, bordering Nigeria and Chad and the Central African Republic, do not have access to potable water, according to a Ministry of Water and Energy official. Sanitation is also limited in the area and recent flooding has aggravated the situation. The affected area is home to some 5 million people, according to UNICEF. Outbreaks are now also occurring across the border in parts of Nigeria, Mintz said. ""There's a lot of people crossing over the border all the time,"" he said. ""So it's not surprising that the cholera is also crossing over the border."" The U.N. children's agency said it has dispatched emergency medical kits containing surgical gloves, water treatment tablets, cholera medicine, oral rehydration salts and educational materials. It said children are especially vulnerable to the disease. Cholera is spread via the oral-fecal route, through water contaminated with human waste. ""What puts people at risk is a lack of safe drinking water,"" Mintz said. Boiling the water or treating it with chlorine or filtration or some other method to remove the contaminants can make it safe. Untreated, cholera can kill within hours, according to the World Health Organization. Worldwide, as many as 120,000 people die each year from cholera.

The gardeners are following seed-strewn paths laid by Michelle Obama and Eleanor Roosevelt, both of whom have used the White House lawn to show the value of a garden during tough times. The scope of today's trend is shocking even to those in the gardening industry. W. Atlee Burpee & Co., the largest seed and gardening supply store in the country, says it has seen a 25 to 30 percent spike in vegetable seed and plant sales this spring compared with last. ""I've been in the business for 30 years, and I've never seen anything like it -- even remotely like it,"" said George Ball, chairman and CEO of the company. In 2008, there was a 15 to 20 percent uptick in seed sales because of high food and gasoline prices. Not since the '70s, when the company saw sales increases in the 10 percent range, has gardening seen such buzz, he said. The National Gardening Association expects 43 million American households to grow their own fruits, vegetables, herbs and berries this year. That's up 19 percent over last year, according to a 2,559-household survey the group conducted in January. Tell us about your garden on iReport.com . About a fifth of the gardeners this year will be new to the activity, the survey says. Most -- 54 percent -- said they will garden because it saves them money on food bills. A slightly larger group say they garden because homegrown food tastes better. There's evidence that recession gardeners stand to see substantial savings at the grocery store checkout. Last year, Burpee released a report saying a family will get an average 25-to-1 return on its investment in a garden. So, by that count, a family that spends about $200 on a medium-to-large garden, as Michelle Obama reportedly did, will save $5,000 in grocery bills over the course of a year. That statistic is inflated, said Mike Metallo, spokesman for the National Gardening Association. Metallo's group says a $70 investment in a garden will yield $600 in produce for the year. To get those savings, a gardener has to know what to plant, when to plant it, where to plant it, how to deal with different soil types and how to care for the garden.  Watch the community of Serenbe bring food from farm to table » . That knowledge isn't innate these days, especially for urban dwellers. Bobby Wilson, president of the American Community Gardening Association, says all of that interest is great, but he worries that Americans aren't equipped to grow their own food without some help. ""Many of the people that want to get into the gardening and greening movement right here have never gained the skills,"" he said. ""Many of them came up in an era where there was no vocational education, so there was no need to learn anything about horticulture or agriculture."" He said all of the country's elementary schools should have gardens so future generations will learn how to save money and fend for themselves. Susan Hopper, a 41-year-old elementary school teacher in Tampa, Florida, said she started a garden last year, partly to teach her family and her students about the food chain. See Hopper's garden on iReport.com . ""I have three children of my own, and they think chicken comes in tenders and nuggets,"" she said. ""I was concerned about their health, and I wanted them to understand that food is a process that we're a part of, and it just doesn't come in neat packages."" Hopper grew up watching her older family members garden, but when she first decided to plow a patch of her own yard, she wasn't too successful. Florida's growing season is somewhat reversed, she said, so even though she had read Internet articles about how to garden, she didn't know the local tricks needed to make her plants survive. In the process of digging back into the soil, though, some new gardeners are struggling with the fact that they're several generations removed from a farm. Pamela Price, a 38-year-old mom in San Antonio, Texas, said her garden isn't profitable just yet because of droughts in her state. See Price's ""victory garden"" on iReport.com . She grew up in a family of ranchers and farmers, but she's forgotten much of what she learned when she was young. ""We are fortunate that we don't have to rely on [the garden], but I certainly want to make sure that, in the event that something happens, we would know how to,"" she said. ""It's a life skill."" Price said she's started to look at her local environment anew as she learns which plants will or won't grow in the harsh climate. That gives her a connection with history, too, she said. She recently read a book about how some of Texas' residents a century ago had similar issues. Wilson, of the community garden association, said new gardeners should seek advice from neighbors. On every block, there's a gardener who is willing to talk about the process, he said. Face-to-face conversations are more helpful than Internet searches when it comes to learning about the local environment, he said. One way to tap local garden knowledge is to join a community garden, where neighbors turn up communal plots together. The activity is expected to see a fivefold increase this year, with 5 million households saying they're at least ""very interested"" in participating in a community garden, said Metallo, of the National Gardening Association. New gardeners should start out small, he said. That way you'll learn as you go and won't get as frustrated. ""You don't have to go hogwild crazy,"" he said, adding that people who tear up their entire yards are usually disappointed. ""Get comfortable with it.""","Americans are turning to gardens as a way to reduce food bills amid recession .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso fears Formula One is in danger of becoming a ""lottery"" and says it could lose its credibility. This season has produced six different winners in six races and, while conceding this was good for spectators, the two-time world champion told CNN it had produced disquiet in the F1 paddock. ""It's a fantastic season, it's so unpredictable. I think people stand in front of the TV, with some surprises every race. It's good for the audience, it's good for the sport to bring attention to the races,"" said the Spaniard, who leads the world championship by three points, with 14 rounds remaining. ""On the other hand we can lose credibility. We cannot lose that the best teams, the best drivers, the best strategies win the races, because at the moment from the outside it seems that in every race anyone can win. ""It doesn't matter the talent, it doesn't matter the team, the performance -- it's like a lottery. What you achieve in Formula One is not by chance. We need to make clear that if you win a race, it's because you did something better. And I don't think at the moment that this is clear for everybody."" Alonso's position at the head of the standings could not have been predicted at the start of this season, when he and his Italian team publicly doubted the race pace of the two Ferraris. ""We were not happy with the car at the beginning of the season. We were not rich with the expectations and the team tried to understand the problems as soon as possible and tried to make the changes,"" the 30-year-old said. ""They seemed to work but even if we are happy now with the position and with the points we achieved, we still know and are honest with ourselves knowing that we are not quick enough at the moment still. There is still plenty of work to do but we think a strong reaction is still to come from Ferrari."" F1 teams battle from race to race to make minor adjustments which often have a big impact on performance, and Alonso gave credit to Ferrari's technicians for improving the cars. ""We changed mainly aerodynamics. Formula One is dominated by aerodynamics and we had some areas of the car that were not working exactly as they were designed, so we did some tweaks there,"" he said. ""We changed some philosophies of working in the car and it started to work. But as I said it's not enough, we know that and we will keep doing upgrades to the car."" While Alonso has shown his ability in an underperforming car, teammate Felipe Massa is under increasing pressure to retain his place. The Brazilian, a world championship runner-up in 2008, has recovered from serious head injuries suffered the following year but has very much been the number two driver since Alonso arrived from Renault in 2010. ""We know that there has been some coincidences and some bad luck and moments in particular races that he didn't score points he deserved,"" Alonso said. ""We know that in practice and in qualifying we are much closer, we are fighting, we are together in some of the first corners, but then some factors make him always in some troubles, some incidents, and he lost points. ""But he has the talent, he has full support from our bosses, from me, from everybody in the team and we know the talent from Felipe. We know that before later he will shine."" Alonso became F1's youngest double world champion when he won back-to-back titles with Renault in 2005-06, but he was usurped by Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel last year. Now the German driver has been tipped to follow Alonso's footsteps and join the most successful team in the sport's history, reportedly in 2014. ""(It's) only speculation. Every year in Ferrari it is like this,"" Alonso said. ""I had this when I was with Renault in the past. Every year around summer always the speculations: 'Alonso will go to Ferrari.' I answered many questions over the years and now when I joined Ferrari it is the opposite. ""Every year someone is coming to Ferrari, it has been like this. I think it is something you have to deal also when you are in Ferrari."" Alonso is hoping, despite his car's weaknesses, that he can deliver Ferrari's first drivers' title since Kimi Raikkonen in 2007. ""Things are complex and not straightforward and I think it will be quite tight for the championship,"" said Alonso, who is 25 points ahead of Raikkonen, back on the grid this year with Lotus after a two-year absence. ""There is not one car dominating the season as we saw in the last couple of years. I think we will be there. I don't know if we will be champions but we will fight until the last race, I am sure.""","Fernando Alonso tells CNN that F1 may be becoming too unpredictable .

"(CNN) -- The Florida Board of Executive Clemency on Thursday voted unanimously to posthumously pardon Jim Morrison, the charismatic lead singer for The Doors, four decades after Morrison was convicted of indecent exposure and open profanity. Outgoing Florida Gov. Charlie Crist -- an admitted Doors fan -- proposed the official let-off for the late singer for a disputed incident during a Miami, Florida, concert. Morrison's widow, Patricia Kennealy Morrison, who opposed the pardon, said she was not surprised at the outcome, given the fans who were supporting it. ""Since the original charges and trial were a publicity stunt to begin with, it doesn't surprise me in the slightest that the pardon should follow in those footsteps,"" she told CNN. Her husband ""did nothing to be pardoned for"" and his record should have been expunged, Patricia Morrison said. Crist, who is set to leave office in January after losing his bid for the Senate in the recent midterm elections, said that after reviewing the case file, he felt compelled to get involved. ""What I do know is that if someone hasn't committed a crime, that should be recognized,"" he said before the vote. ""We live in a civil society that understands that lasting legacy of a human being, and maybe the last act for which they may be known, is something that never occurred in the first place, it's never a bad idea to try to right a wrong."" The governor said the conviction should have been dismissed after Morrison's death ""so that he was again presumed innocent."" ""A pardon corrects the fact that Mr. Morrison is now unable to take advantage of the presumption of innocence that is the cornerstone of the American criminal justice system,"" Crist said in a statement after the vote. Board member Alex Sink, the state's outgoing chief financial officer, said she spent the day Wednesday listening to The Doors. Crist, Sink, Attorney General Bill McCollum and Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson voted for the pardon. Morrison had been performing with the band at a typically raucous concert at Miami's Key Auditorium on March 1, 1969, when the incident took place. Reportedly drunk and slurring obscenities at the crowd, he was accused of unzipping his pants and simulating a sex act, a charge he denied. Despite being acquitted of lascivious behavior and drunkenness, Morrison was convicted of indecent exposure and open profanity and sentenced to six months in jail. He was still appealing the verdict in 1971 when he died in Paris of a heart attack at the age of 27. He would have turned 67 on Wednesday. Doors fans have long appealed for an official pardon for ""The Lizard King,"" petitioning previous Florida governors without success. Many argue that the trial was a sham and that there was no conclusive evidence supporting the exposure charge against Morrison. ""Since last month, about 130 people have written in favor of the pardon, and 70 are opposed,"" Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey said. Normally, Ivey said, up to 15 letters per case are received. ""It far exceeds the amount of input we usually have on clemency or pardon cases,"" he said. ""I just don't think there is sufficient evidence in the file or on the record, no photos or video that would indicate that the alleged act occurred,"" Crist said. ""My heart bleeds for (Morrison) and his family."" But Patricia Morrison, author of the book ""Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison,"" said he would reject such a pardon. ""I think he would reject this completely out of hand,"" she told CNN. ""He would just say, 'You know, no thanks. I can't be bothered.'"" Patricia Morrison wasn't at the concert where the incident took place, but said by most accounts, evidence that Jim Morrison exposed himself was slim, although she acknowledged he was drunk at the time. She attended his trial, and ""I saw a stack of photos that the prosecution was entering in as evidence."" The most compromising one, she said, ""was him with his hand stuck down the front of his pants."" ""Despite the fact that there were 10,000 people in the hall that night, funny thing, no one has a picture of the actual exposure of the Lizard King's lizard,"" said Patricia Morrison, who currently writes rock and roll mystery novels. She calls the idea of a pardon silly, writing in a letter to Crist that Jim Morrison ""would hate, loathe, detest and despise the whole idea. He would think it is yet another pathetic attempt by the State of Florida to use him for its own cheap and cynical publicity-hungry purposes, and I have no doubt but that he would rip the 'pardon' into tiny pieces."" ""He didn't do anything wrong, but he wouldn't want to be cleared,"" she told CNN. The late '60s and early '70s saw an evolving culture of drugs, hippies and rock-and-roll music that helped set a theme for that generation. ""Make love, not war"" was a popular slogan. However, following Jim Morrison's arrest several days after the concert, a decency rally was staged at the Orange Bowl. The trial took its toll on the singer, Patricia Morrison said. He moved to Paris during the appeal. Even today, The Doors' music remains popular. ""He was light years ahead of his time,"" Patricia Morrison said of her husband. ""Which, I think, is why people still identify so strongly with his art and what he was trying to do."" But she said it's hard for her to listen to the band. ""I don't listen, because I don't want to be surprised by Jim when I'm not really prepared to hear his voice,"" she said. ""It's very painful. ... That's the voice that sings all those wonderful songs. But it's also the voice that said all those really nice things into my ear. And that's really hard to get around sometimes.""

"London (CNN) -- A journalist at Rupert Murdoch's British tabloid newspaper The Sun was arrested Monday on suspicion of culling information from stolen cell phones. Police announced the arrest without naming the suspect, while a source close to the newspaper's publisher, News International, confirmed it was Nick Parker. The source asked not to be named discussing internal company business. Read more: Timeline of UK phone hacking scandal . The arrest is the latest in a long-running police investigation prompted by illegal eavesdropping at the defunct Murdoch tabloid The News of the World, which has expanded into probes of computer hacking, bribery and corruption. Parker was arrested earlier as part of the corruption investigation, the source close to News International said. He has not been charged. The first charges for phone hacking itself came last week, as prosecutors charged a former aide to British Prime Minister David Cameron and a close confidant of media baron Rupert Murdoch, along with six others. Cameron's former director of communications, Andy Coulson, and Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Murdoch's News International, were charged Tuesday. The announced names of the suspected hacking victims include some of the world's biggest celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Paul McCartney, soccer star Wayne Rooney and actor Jude Law. Read more: Full CPS statement . The phone-hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism, led to the closing of a major tabloid and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Murdoch. The charging announcement delivers one more public relations blow to Murdoch, who stepped down from a string of company boards of directors earlier this month and further distanced himself from the print business that first brought him fame and fortune. Coulson and Brooks are former editors of The News of the World, which was shut down last year in the face of public outrage at the hacking scandal. Parent company News Corp.'s multibillion-dollar bid to take over British Sky Broadcasting collapsed as the scandal spread. Brooks, who was charged with conspiracy to intercept voice mails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, vigorously denied the charges, saying she was ""distressed and angry."" Coulson said he ""wouldn't and, more importantly, that I didn't, do anything to damage the Milly Dowler investigation."" The scandal exploded with the revelation that the phone of Dowler, a 13-year-old British girl, was hacked after she disappeared in 2002. She was later found murdered. Indications that her voice mail had been accessed had given her parents the false hope she was still alive. Prosecutors allege there were more than 600 victims of phone hacking between 2000 and 2006.

"(CNN) -- The British tabloid News of the World hacked Kate Middleton's phone while she was dating Prince William, a prosecutor told a London court Thursday in a trial of the defunct newspaper's executives, according to the British Press Association. In one voicemail message that William left Kate -- the transcript of which was read in court by the prosecutor -- the prince calls his future wife ""Babykins"" and says he was almost shot by blank rounds during a military training exercise, the PA reported. The date of the message wasn't immediately clear, though the couple weren't yet married at the time, the PA reported. Middleton became the Duchess of Cambridge when she married William in April 2011. The transcript, dug up during a police investigation into the newspaper's alleged hacking practices, was one of several messages between the couple that were read at London's Old Bailey court, the PA reported. The revelation came at the trial of former News of the World editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson and the paper's former managing editor, Stuart Kuttner. All are accused of conspiring between October 2000 and August 2006 ""to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority."" They deny the charges. Glenn Mulcaire, a former private investigator for News International -- the then parent company of News of the World -- was convicted of phone hacking in 2006 and has already pleaded guilty to hacking charges in the current case. UK phone-hacking trial: Kate Middleton's name on 'target evaluation' list . Greg Miskiw, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup have also pleaded guilty in the case. Jurors were told that Ian Edmondson, who is also charged with conspiring to hack phones between October 2000 and August 2006, is ""currently unfit"" and will take no further part in the trial, the PA reported. He will be tried at a later date, the judge said. Brooks, her husband, Charlie Brooks, and her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter also face a separate set of charges of conspiring to obstruct the police investigation into phone hacking.

Among the allegations made in the trial previously: A police investigator testified that several hundred attempts were made to hack the cellphones of aides to princes Charles, William and Harry. Hacking allegations against the News of the World prompted British Prime Minister David Cameron to set up an independent inquiry, led by Lord Justice Leveson, to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the media with the public, police and politicians.

"(Fast Company)  -- Does Facebook really have more than 500 million ""active"" users? According to data from digital-legacy planning firm Entrustet, a big portion of these users will soon no longer be considered ""active,"" by any reasonable measure. The company compared Facebook usership data with average death rates from the Center for Disease Control, and discovered that this year, around 480,000 Facebook users may pass away in the U.S., and 1.78 million worldwide. These figures are only likely to grow year to year, especially as Facebook expands pass the 600 million user mark. So many profiles now fall out of the range of an ""active"" user. Beyond the deceased, there are endless duplicate accounts -- Entrustet found that 150% of 20- to 24-year-olds in the U.S. are on Facebook -- not exactly a plausible tally. Fast Company: The Facebooks of China . What's more, a recent Gartner report estimated that in the coming years, roughly one in every ten of your friends on Facebook and other social networks will be nonhuman, meaning they'll be ""social bots,"" automated profiles created by brands and organizations to engage consumers. With profiles of the departed presumably being left untouched, with social bots soon to be plaguing the network, and with duplicate accounts running amok, how can Facebook ever provide an accurate ""active"" usership count? For the deceased, Facebook has created a system of ""memorializing"" accounts, which adjusts a profile's privacy settings to be seen only by confirmed family and friends. Immediate family members may also request the removal of a loved one's account. But the onus is on the deceased's relatives -- if the ""memorializing"" feature is not activated, Facebook will continue to assume the profile still represents an active user. The same assumption goes for duplicate accounts as well -- Facebook relies on users to merge accounts and report fake profiles. To address this issue, Facebook has defined an ""active"" user as one who has logged in within the last 30 days. Thus, a month after a user passes away, that user is no longer considered ""active,"" appropriately. For organizations and businesses registered for the social network, Facebook distinguishes their accounts as ""profiles"" rather than ""user pages,"" and does not count them as active users. Fast Company: A graphic guide to Facebook portraits . But for duplicate and fake accounts, keeping them accountable is more difficult, as users might be willing to log in to multiple accounts. So while the company's latest partner Goldman Sachs has been boasting of Facebook's 600 million-plus userbase, it's unclear just how accurate those figures will be if investors -- and advertisers, for that matter -- ever choose to parse the details.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A U.S. helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan on Monday, but none of the 10 soldiers on board were killed, according to a U.S. military spokesman. File image of U.S. UH-60 helicopter in action. The Taliban claimed that its fighters used a rocket-propelled grenade launcher to shoot down a U.S. UH-60 helicopter in the Wardak province, about 30 miles (50km) west of Kabul. Maj. John Redfield, a U.S. military spokesman, told CNN a coalition helicopter went down in the Wardak province after an exchange of fire with enemy on the ground. All 10 soldiers on board were picked up and taken to safety, he said. He could not say if any were injured. Meanwhile, a suicide bomber on Monday killed two soldiers and wounded three others in northern Afghanistan, a spokesman for the U.S. military in Afghanistan said. The spokesman provided no further details. An Afghan official said the incident took place as U.S. officials gathered to meet with the police chief in Pul-e-Khumri in Baghlan province. One American soldier and an Afghan child were killed in the attack, Afghan officials said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Provincial Governor Abdul Jabar Haqbeen said a man wearing a police uniform detonated his explosive-filled vest when Afghan and American soldiers stopped him from entering the police chief's office. The chief and his American advisers were meeting inside at the time, Haqbeen said. The bomber also died in the attack, which wounded four police officers, said Abdul Rahman Sayed Khaili, the province's police chief. Pul-e-Khumri is located about 130 miles (209 km) north of the capital, Kabul. Attacks in northern Afghanistan are rare where militants have, until now, been relatively inactive. But officials say they are beginning to see a rise in incidents in the region and believe insurgents are gaining the support of the Pashtun minority there.

"(CNN) -- Languishing in the tennis equivalent of purgatory, the road to redemption for Viktor Troicki is likely to be a long one. The Serb returns to the professional tour after his contentious one-year doping suspension ended Monday, but at a time when he should be in his prime Troicki is ranked 842nd -- or in tennis' abyss. That means, without wildcards, he'll struggle to get into ATP and even second-tier events. It's a world away from when Troicki was ranked 12th or when he became only the seventh man in the Open Era to win the decisive fifth match in a Davis Cup final. ""Honestly, it's been a tough year,"" Troicki told CNN in a telephone interview. ""Mentally it was tough to handle everything but as time went on, I started preparing and practicing, and I was focused on my comeback and new start -- and looking forward to it."" From a financial standpoint, many might not have much sympathy for the 28-year-old. After all, he claimed $900,000 in prize money in 2011 and has pocketed $4.5 million in his career. Even taking into account expenses, he's probably made a nice profit, and Troicki acknowledged that during his time away from the game, he's been able to live a ""normal"" life. He felt wronged by his ban and in that respect, he has backers including good pal and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. Troicki's tale was a case of he said, she said. Feeling ill and saying he had a longstanding fear of needles, Troicki refused to take a blood test at the Monte Carlo Masters in April 2013. He submitted the requisite urine sample. He claimed doping control officer Elena Gorodilova told him he could skip the blood test that day without facing any punishment so long as he explained the situation to Stuart Miller, head of the ITF's anti-doping program. Gorodilova denied that claim but when the Court of Arbitration for Sport -- Troicki appealed his original 18-month ban from the ITF -- issued its irrevocable verdict in November, it stated: ""The CAS panel considered that the DCO should have informed the player in clearer terms of the risks caused by his refusal to undergo a blood test but that, despite the misunderstanding between the player and the DCO, there was no suggestion that Mr. Troicki intended to evade the detection of a banned substance in his system."" Still CAS ruled that Troicki ""did indeed commit an anti-doping violation"" and his sanction stood, though was reduced by six months. Troicki still ponders the ordeal -- and ""often."" ""I think about it a lot, I can't lie,"" said Troicki, who took his blood test the next day. ""For me it just feels unfair because I know what really happened in there. I know I never wanted to cheat. In the end I was totally clean and that's what hurts me. ""She informed me wrong and I paid a big bill for that. I was always compliant with the rules and anti-doping system."" Jack Reader, Troicki's coach, went as far as to say that what happened was ""disgusting."" ""It's laughable, it's disgusting, it's incredible how it is,"" Reader told CNN. ""He followed her advice. Okay, he was negligent of the rules, but not a year's worth. ""I think it's unbelievably exaggerated the whole thing. Now we're moving on and we'll just prove to people something else."" In response to Reader's comments, Miller said that all players were treated ""equally and fairly."" ""Mr. Troicki was afforded, and took, the opportunity to provide evidence to the Independent tribunal and the Court of Arbitration for Sport, both of which concluded that he had committed an anti-doping rule violation,"" said MIller in an emailed statement sent to CNN. CNN attempted to contact Gorodilova but a message left with International Doping Tests and Management Limited -- whom Gorodilova was working for -- wasn't returned. Early in his suspension, it was too painful for Troicki to watch tennis, he said, but he has done more of that in the last few months. Djokovic, meanwhile, has continued to help Troicki. After defending Troicki at the year-end championships, Djokovic has then practiced with his fellow Belgrade native. According to Troicki, some of their hitting sessions took place in Dubai, Miami and Monte Carlo -- just before qualifying began at those events. Under the terms of his ineligibility, Troicki wasn't breaking any rules. ""Novak helped me a lot when he had weeks of preparation, he always invited me,"" said Troicki. ""He really did a lot for me and I will never forget that."" Reader has stuck by Troicki, too. He told the New York Times he was entitled to 100,000 euros ($135,000) if Troicki was ever found guilty of doping, but hasn't cashed in. ""I could have had a nice holiday,"" Reader, a laid-back Aussie, told CNN with a smile in June at the AEGON Championships. ""I didn't think it was justifiable to use that part of the contract. ""I felt Vik had enough problems and I wanted to stand by him. Now it's up to me and particularly him, to get repayment."" Matching his monetary success of 2011 won't happen for a while. ""Financially it's been terrible,"" Troicki said. ""When I start playing I won't be able to compete at the level I was, at the biggest tournaments, biggest prize moneys."" He tried to get a wild card into the main draw at next week's ATP Swiss Open in Gstaad but was unsuccessful, and unless there are no shows, can't get into qualifying, either. The first priority for wild cards in qualifying are given to Swiss players, vice tournament director Julien Finkbeiner told CNN. Yet, ""it would be a good thing for us if he gets into the main draw,"" Finkbeiner said, presumably because of Troicki's standing as a former top-15 pro. ""He's going to need wild cards into anything, Futures even,"" said Reader, referring to the third rung of tennis' professional ladder where some titlists in the first week of July received about $2,000. That's a huge initial huge wage cut for Troicki given first-round losers at Wimbledon pick up $46,000. Troicki's suspension came with at least one positive. He went back to school, studying sports management at Alfa University in Belgrade, and Reader said the rest Troicki's body received should add a ""couple of years"" to his career.

"(CNN) -- Aaron Peirsol was the victim of the biggest shock of the world swimming championships so far when he failed to qualify for the final of the 100 meters backstroke in Rome. Defending world champion Peirsol reflects on missing out on the final of the men's 100m backstroke. The 26-year-old is the only man to have gone under 52 seconds for the event and is the winner of the last three world titles. The American has also won seven Olympic medals, five of them gold, as well as seven world titles and one silver  -- and holds the world records in both the 100m and 200m backstroke. But, lying second at halfway in Monday's semifinal, Peirsol miscalculated on the second length to find himself in fourth in 53.22 seconds and ninth overall -- missing out on a final place. Peirsol admitted he had made a major error, telling reporters: ""I thought I was going faster. The result has surprised me. ""I am very disappointed; I completely misjudged my race. I have to go on, pick myself up and focus on my next event."" Five world records were set in the evening session at the Foro Italico, with the first coming in the opening event. Australian Brenton Rickard set a new record in the 100m breaststroke, with two men dipping under Kosuke Kitajima's old mark. Rickard pipped France's Hugues Duboscq, who was seventh into the final, in 58.58 to take 0.33 off the old mark. Duboscq also bettered the old record in 58.64 -- with Cameron Van Der Burgh of South Africa third in 58.95. Eric Shanteau, who competed in the Beijing Olympics despite having been diagnosed with testicular cancer shortly beforehand, was touched out into fourth. The second event then saw Swedish teenager Sarah Sjostrom set her second 100m butterfly world record in 24 hours. Gabriella Silva was 0.71 under world record pace at halfway, with Sjostrom in eighth. Jessicah Schipper then powered down the final length but was overhauled by the 15-year-old in the final meters to touch in 56.06 -- 0.38 inside the mark she set on Sunday. Australian Schipper also went under the old mark in 56.23 to take her second successive world championship silver medal in this event. Ariana Kukors also set another world record in just 24 hours as she took the 200m individual medley title. She lowered her own mark to 2:06.15, meaning she had taken 2.30secs off Stephanie Rice's old mark over two days. Rice was second, matching the American's record from Sunday, with Hosszu in third. American Rebecca Soni consigned Leisel Jones' record to history in the semis of the 100m breaststroke, dipping 0.25 inside in 1:04.84. Jones is not competing in Rome, instead choosing to finish her beauty school studies in Australia.","Aaron Peirsol fails to qualify for the final of the 100 meters backstroke in Rome .

"(CNN) -- Call it one small step for a cheese, one giant leap fromage-kind. A wheel of Le Brouere cheese was the secret cargo aboard the SpaceX Dragon, the first commercial spacecraft to be recovered from Earth orbit, the company revealed Thursday. SpaceX co-founder Elon Musk hinted at the cargo after the capsule's successful splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday afternoon, suggesting it had something to do with the British comedy troupe Monty Python. The block of fermented curd was a nod to one of the group's best-known sketches, ""Cheese Shop."" The wheel, described only as ""very big,"" was being towed back to California aboard a barge along with the spacecraft and ""basking in the glow of being the first cheese to travel to orbit on a commercial spacecraft,"" company spokeswoman Kirstin Brost told CNN. In another comedy reference, the payload was bolted to the floor of SpaceX's Dragon 9 spacecraft in a circular drum bearing a picture of a cow and the warning ""Top Secret!"" -- a nod to the 1984 spoof by the creators of ""Airplane!"" The Dragon was launched into low-Earth orbit on Wednesday from Florida's Kennedy Space Center and splashed down about 500 miles off the coast of Southern California about three hours later. It was the first flight under NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program, which aims to develop commercial supply services to the international space station.

"(CNN) -- Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said early Tuesday that his country will not renew a cease-fire with pro-Russian separatists, vowing instead ""we will advance, and we will liberate our land."" The fragile cease-fire expired at midnight Monday -- hours after Poroshenko spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. The cease-fire -- agreed upon earlier this month amid a volatile political crisis -- raised hopes that Ukraine could be moving back from the brink of full-fledged civil war. The crisis has its roots in former President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to shun a European Union Association Agreement last year and work with Russia instead. The move unleashed deadly strife that led to Yanukovych's ouster, Ukraine's loss of Crimea and a pro-Russia separatist rebellion. Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since the Russian annexation of Crimea in March, when Russia also massed troops along its western border with Ukraine. After Monday's phone call, Poroshenko said his goal was peace, but said it takes the participation of all parties to maintain stability, noting violations of the cease-fire by pro-Russian separatists. A statement from Putin's press office about the call said the Russian President ""stressed the need to extend the cease-fire and also establish a reliable mechanism for monitoring"" it.","The cease-fire expired at midnight Monday .

"(CNN) -- With three police officers dead and two others wounded, Justin Bourque had finally admitted ""I'm done"" and given up. Two months later, he made it official. The 24-year-old Canadian man pleaded guilty Friday to three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, his lawyer David Lutz said. He is set to be sentenced October 27. Bourque's submission stands in contrast to the brazen relentlessness he showed in June, when he embarked on a grisly rampage through Moncton, New Brunswick, some 150 kilometers (93 miles) northeast of Saint John. The carnage prompted people to shutter themselves in their houses and barricades to spring up around Moncton, a city of 140,000 people that had no homicides at all in 2011 and 2012. It ended early June 7, when Bourque was arrested after yelling through a window, a nearby resident told CNN partner CBC. ""They (police) were screaming for about five minutes and they had their guns loaded,"" the resident, Michelle Thibodeau, told CBC. ""And eventually Justin came out with his hands up and he yelled, 'I'm done.' And they collected him and brought him to my front yard, where he lay sprawled out. "" The slain Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers were Constables David Ross, 32, Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, and Douglas James Larche, 40. Why did Bourque do it? A Facebook page that purportedly belongs to him has many posts with pro-gun photos and a few anti-police memes. There is also a photo where two men pose with shotguns in the snow. It was posted on February 25, six days after the Facebook page was created, and is used as the profile picture. According to CBC, the judge at Borque's hearing Friday told the defendant he could be facing consecutive life sentences with no chance of parole for 75 years for the three first-degree murder charges.

"(CNN) -- After two years of a virtual stalemate of progress in Washington, members of Congress are headed home for five weeks during August. The pressure is on for both parties to tell two very different stories to voters with only a short time before the election. So who will have the better narrative? And will Americans listen? Voters are unhappy with everyone, which includes President Barack Obama, Democrats and Republicans. According to Real Clear Politics polling average, President Obama's approval rating stands at 41.6% while Congressional approval is in the tank at 12.3%. Partisan warfare is a clear culprit to these low ratings. During August, voters should be prepared to take plenty of Advil, because their headaches are about to get worse. Expect to hear Democrats complain loudly that Republicans are going to try to impeach Obama, that an attempt to sue the President is a useless partisan exercise designed to fundraise from conservatives across the country and that women should be very afraid of the Supreme Court decision on contraceptives. Republicans will shout that Democrats are driving the impeachment story to fundraise off their liberal base, that the Senate is obstructing progress to protect their vulnerable members in red states from having to take tough votes and that suing Obama is necessary because he isn't doing his real job of working with Congress. The polarization merry-go-round in Washington can be very attractive for a member of Congress to fall into selling a partisan only message to their constituents. But, when Americans run into a TV show they don't like, they turn the channel. Voters are desperate to know about what can be accomplished to help them. Climate change isn't going to cut it for Democrats and abortion isn't going to work for Republicans. They simply don't connect to the average voter concerns. The issues that matter are front and center in everyday American life. Both sides are going to have to address the border crisis and their solutions to the problem. We are dealing with innocent children who are caught up in this mess. The news has saturated America and is a common topic around dinner tables and water coolers across the country. People are concerned and frustrated that Washington has spent too much time finger-pointing at each other. How do our elected officials plan to help create the conditions for more jobs, more money in their wallets and more food on the table? How can their lives be made better for themselves and their children? The Democrats will likely point to some positive economic indicators and rising consumer confidence to show that it is turning around. But they lack an overall agenda to demonstrate there is a future method toward achieving economic stability. Republicans can show they have a plan to turn around the economy faster, but rightfully point out the inaction by the Senate Democrats to address Republican plans. The House of Representatives, run by Republicans, has passed myriad bills dealing with job creation, gas prices and small business issues. These bills can be used as basis for a forward-looking agenda. The battle over the female voter will continue through August, with Democrats pointing to the Supreme Court Hobby Lobby decision on female contraception coverage as a threat to women's rights. The Democrats have also tried to push through votes appealing to the middle class on the minimum wage and the gender gap in pay. House Republicans finally wised up and recently offered a female agenda of their own right before the August break that would increase job training, incentivize flexible work schedules, provide tax breaks for children and families, and strengthens charter schools. The package also includes new legislation to prevent retaliation when women ask about equal pay. Beyond this rhetoric, there is a better opportunity for Republicans in this election cycle to sell a positive message to voters because Democrats are being forced to defend the White House and its handling of the crises at home and abroad. It's more difficult for a Democrat to have to answer questions about the missing e-mail scandal at the Internal Revenue Service or President Obama's handling of Israel or the Ukraine and then pivot to a positive message on female gender pay. Mad people vote. And people are mad at Washington. Republicans can blame the President for his failure of leadership, but the bulk of their arguments must be centered on positive solutions that connect with people who are tired of the finger pointing. This means that Americans could lean toward the GOP when they vote this November, if the focus is kept on what people are demanding to know, which is, ""How we get out of this mess?""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Rick Renzi has been indicted on charges he promised to support legislation in exchange for a land deal that netted the Arizona Republican more than $700,000, the Justice Department said Friday. In a 35-count indictment unsealed early Friday, Renzi, 49, is charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering, extortion and insurance fraud. Also named in the indictment is Renzi's former business partner and real estate investor, James W. Sandlin, 56, of Sherman, Texas, and Andrew Beardall, 36, of Rockville, Maryland. Renzi's attorneys, Reid Weingarten and Kelly Kramer, denied their client had done anything wrong. ""We will fight these charges until he is vindicated and his family's name is restored,"" the attorneys said in a statement. The attorneys said their client had buried his father, Eugene Renzi, at Arlington National Cemetery on Thursday. ""We are disappointed that the Department of Justice would not allow a decent amount of time to pass to allow a son to mourn the passing of his father,"" the statement said. At a news conference in Phoenix, Arizona, prosecutors said Renzi conspired with Sandlin to conduct a land swap in exchange for the congressman's push to get a House committee's approval for the deal. Federal prosecutors said Renzi received $733,000 in the deal but did not disclose the income to Congress in his 2005 financial disclosure statement. U.S. Attorney Diane Humetewa said that Renzi ""used his official authority as a United States representative"" to ensure that the 2005 federal land exchange included land owned by Sandlin. Another goal of the conspiracy was to conceal that Renzi received a portion of the proceeds from the deal, according to the indictment. Renzi was having financial difficulty in 2005 and ""needed a substantial infusion of funds to keep his insurance business solvent and maintain his personal lifestyle,"" the indictment said. The 26-page indictment outlines a series of transactions involving Renzi and Sandlin, who were co-owners of Fountain Realty and Development, until Renzi ran for a seat in Congress and sold his share of the company to Sandlin. Sandlin bought out Renzi's interest for $200,000 and a note for $800,000, according to a statement from the Justice Department. In 2005, when Sandlin still owed him $700,000 on the note, ""Renzi insisted that two separate entities doing business in Arizona purchase Sandlin's property in exchange for his support on land exchange legislation,"" authorities said. Renzi and Beardall are charged with insurance fraud, accused of embezzling more than $400,000 in insurance premiums from the trust account of the Patriot Insurance Agency, a business owned by the Renzi family in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, to fund his congressional campaign in 2001 and 2002. They're also accused of making false statements to influence state regulatory investigations, a statement said. ""There were concealment efforts, misrepresentations and fraudulent statements made,"" Humetewa said. If convicted, Renzi could face up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud and extortion and 20 years in prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering and concealing money laundering as well as lesser sentences for convictions on the other counts, prosecutors said. Renzi and the other defendants will be served summonses to appear in U.S. Magistrate Court in Tucson, Arizona, for an arraignment March 6, Humetewa said. Renzi has been under an ethical cloud since the FBI raided a family business last year. The FBI said it was investigating whether the congressman had used his office for personal gain. He stepped down from the House Intelligence Committee in April after the raid. Renzi, a three-term member of the House, announced in August that he would not seek re-election. He represents Arizona's 1st Congressional District.  E-mail to a friend . CNN's Terry Frieden and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: Rep.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban will permit a program of polio vaccination in the volatile Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, their spokesman told CNN in an e-mail Tuesday, after consistent pressure over the issue. The statement comes a day after Afghan President Hamid Karzai called on the Taliban and other insurgents to allow the vaccination teams to help save children from a lifetime of paralysis. It marks the Taliban's latest move to garner respectability amid attempts to get peace talks under way in the region. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said insurgents had been instructed to let the vaccinations take place provided aid workers do not use government facilities. ""The polio vaccinators must not use government resources, including vehicles and soldiers, and they should use their own resources so that they impartially execute their program,"" Mujahid said. He added the Taliban have always backed vaccinations. The statement to CNN came the same day that the presidential palace appealed to the Taliban to let the vital program take place unhindered. ""Despite all the past efforts to vaccinate millions against polio, there are still children suffering from the disease on both sides of the Durand Line,"" Karzai said. The Durand Line is the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The statement from the palace added: ""The president appeals to religious scholars, mullahs and community leaders and elders to cooperate with the immunization teams by persuading the opposition to allow vaccinators to administer polio drops to children against the permanent paralysis."" According to World Health Organization, there are four countries in which the transmission of polio has never been stopped: Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. They face a range of challenges, such as insecurity, weak health systems and poor sanitation. Polio could spread from these ""endemic"" countries to infect children in other countries with less-than-adequate vaccination, the organization says. Reports from the Afghan Ministry of Public Health show a threefold rise in the number of polio cases in 2011 compared with that of 2010. A ministry report that covered 2011 showed 80 cases in Afghanistan, 62 of which were in the south of the country, the government statement said.","Taliban spokesman: ""The polio vaccinators must not use government resources""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- ""Cloverfield"" is the first adrenaline-pumping monster hit of the year, bringing in more than $40 million dollars on its opening weekend. The thriller is told from the point of view of five young New Yorkers using their handheld camera. But for some viewers, being ""part"" of the movie is making them sick -- literally. Theaters showing ""Cloverfield"" are posting warnings of possible motion sickness. One blogger on the popular movie database IMDB.com said, ""I had to get up and leave the theater for nearly 20 minutes just to keep from hurling."" Other moviegoers have reported being nauseated and dizzy. Most viewers are unaffected by the film, but for those who are, experts say the problem is in their heads. ""This is a classic case of vertigo,"" said Dr. Michael G. Stewart, chairman of otorhinolaryngology (ear, nose and throat medicine) at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weil Cornell Medical Center. ""You can look around and feel like things are moving, when they aren't."" Vertigo is caused when a person's balance system gets confused. Your body feels a strong visual sensation of movement but in reality, you aren't moving at all. The disconnect confuses your brain sensors and can cause dizziness and nausea, Stewart said.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain what's making viewers sick » . AMC theaters across the country have posted signs warning moviegoers of potential ""side effects associated with motion sickness similar to riding a roller-coaster."" So why does the film style affect some viewers and not others? ""People have different levels of susceptibility, similar to how some people cannot ride on a small boat without getting sick,"" Stewart said. ""It's just a natural variation."" The good news is, experiencing vertigo is rare for most people. So if you are itching to see ""Cloverfield"" but are worried you might get sick, experts recommend taking a dose of over-the-counter anti-vertigo medicine, sold under such brand names as Bonine and Dramamine II. ""It might not protect you from all the symptoms, but it could, and it certainly can't hurt,"" Stewart said. Another tip is to briefly close your eyes during the movie. It may be enough to recalibrate your sensors and soothe your symptoms long enough to finish the movie. And if you're really concerned, just wait to rent the movie. ""A person would be fine watching from home,"" Stewart said. ""When you are on your couch, you have perspective around the screen so your mind knows the movie is moving and the room isn't.""

"(CNN) -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein is not a bomb thrower. As the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee she has, for instance, been a stalwart public defender of the National Security Agency's controversial bulk collection of phone data in the United States. That is why the verbal hand grenade she threw on the Senate floor on Tuesday is a device sufficiently explosive that it may represent the largest rupture between Congress and the CIA since the Church committee hearings of the mid-1970s, in which CIA officials were summoned to testify publicly about the agency's dirty tricks, such as its plan to assassinate Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. In an angry speech, Feinstein asserted that the CIA has violated federal laws by covertly removing classified documents from her committee's computers as it pursued a multiyear investigation of the CIA's interrogation and detention programs . Feinstein said that four years ago the CIA removed hundreds of pages of documents that were being reviewed by her staff on computers at a CIA facility set up for the Senate staff's use in Virginia. Feinstein says CIA spied on Senate computers . In 2009, Feinstein, a Democrat from California, assumed chairmanship of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which provides oversight on all 16 of the U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA. From that position Feinstein has often sided with the CIA on issues that are important to the agency, for instance, defending the CIA's use of armed drones to kill suspected terrorists in Pakistan and Yemen. If Feinstein's allegation about the CIA search of her committee's computers is correct, such an intrusion would likely violate laws that prevent the CIA from conducting domestic surveillance, not to mention that it would constitute a potential violation of the separation of powers. Walking with the help of a cane after a recent fall on black ice, CIA Director John Brennan made a rare public speech Tuesday at the Council on Foreign Relations in which he denied the charge. ""As far as the allegations of CIA hacking into Senate computers -- nothing could be further from the truth. We wouldn't do that."" This dispute between the Senate Intelligence Committee and the CIA is, in fact, part of a much larger dispute about the Intelligence Committee's investigation of the agency's post-9/11 secret overseas prisons housing al Qaeda detainees and the CIA interrogation program for those prisoners, some of whom were subjected to coercive techniques such as waterboarding. The yet-to-be released 6,300-page report by the Senate Intelligence Committee pours cold water on CIA claims that coercive interrogations yielded a great deal of useful information about al Qaeda plots and saved lives. In fact, according to one U.S. official familiar with the report, when so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" were used on one of Osama bin Laden's captured couriers, Hassan Ghul, they were actually counterproductive. Ghul was cooperative before these techniques were used, but he stopped talking after he was subjected to coercive interrogations. The official said the CIA also misled President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney about the efficacy of these coercive techniques. The CIA has prepared its own secret 122-page rebuttal of the Senate report. The Senate report also undercuts the claim that the hunt for bin Laden was helped by detainees in CIA custody who were subjected to coercive interrogations and that led the agency to focus on one of bin Laden's couriers, a notion that was popularized in the Oscar-nominated film ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Feinstein released a statement in 2012 saying, ""The CIA did not first learn about the existence of the Osama bin Laden courier from CIA detainees subjected to coercive interrogation techniques. Nor did the CIA discover the courier's identity from detainees subjected to coercive techniques. ... Instead, the CIA learned of the existence of the courier, his true name and location through means unrelated to the CIA detention and interrogation program."" If any good can come of this dispute one can only hope that a 300-page summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee report is released in some declassified form so the American public and the world can finally get a better sense of how useful the CIA detention and interrogation programs really were. To get this longstanding controversy resolved, the Obama White House should show some real leadership on the issue and step in to push all sides for the release -- at the very least -- of a declassified version of the 300-page summary of the Senate report as well as a similarly declassified version of the CIA's rebuttal.","Sen.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A drone strike in Yemen on Saturday killed at least 10 suspected al Qaeda militants but also inadvertently resulted in the deaths of three civilian day laborers, a high-level Yemeni government official told CNN. The strike targeted a pickup in al-Hazemiyah district of al-Bayda province, three Yemeni Defense Ministry sources said. The militants were heading to neighboring Shabwa province, a hotbed for al Qaeda, they said. ""The truck targeted carried 11 militants. The targeting came while they were in transit after leaving a training site. Ten were killed and one was injured,"" the government official said on the condition of anonymity. A civilian truck carrying five day laborers was also hit in the strike, the official said. Three died and two were wounded. A casualty toll released earlier by the three Yemen Defense Ministry officials was slightly higher, with 12 suspected militants and three civilians reportedly killed. ""The militants were on a coordinating mission, and we have had our eyes on them for quite a while now,"" a senior ministry official told CNN on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. Operatives targeted . A source from the region said the strike targeted three ""well-known"" al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula operatives linked to a training camp in southern Yemen. AQAP, considered the most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate, has repeatedly been targeted by drone strikes. None of those killed in the strike was believed to be among AQAP's senior leadership, the source said. The targets of the drone strike had been closely monitored for some time during their training camp activities, the source said. The drone strike came on the heels of the recent emergence of a video showing a large gathering of al Qaeda members in Yemen. There is no indication -- at this point -- that this strike had anything to do with the video, made last month and aired by CNN earlier this week. ""The strike today had nothing to do with the tape showing the gathering of AQAP,"" the government official said. ""This operation was in the making for some time, as AQAP has stepped up its attacks against military targets and government officials in Bayda."" Salem al-Kashm was driving behind the civilian pickup driven by a friend when he said the strikes occurred. ""Minutes after the first attack, a second attack took place, killing three of my friends,"" he said. ""The drone then kept going in circles after the attack to ensure that none of the militants were able to escape."" A Defense Ministry official said, ""It's unfortunate the civilians were there in the wrong time."" Yemen's al Qaeda threat . The United States is the only country known to have conducted drone strikes in Yemen. So far this year, including Saturday's strike, there have been eight drone attacks in the country, according to Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst. Only this week, Yemen's Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi said his country could handle the al Qaeda threat alone. ""Security is one of the main challenges facing Yemen,"" al-Qirbi said. Even though more voices have risen within Yemen in opposition to U.S.-led drone strikes, President Abdu Rabu Hadi has shown no sign his counterterrorism strategy will change, especially because al Qaeda has proved to be a bigger threat than anticipated. But his stance has angered some parliamentarians. ""It's a black dot for President Hadi to allow drones to roam our skies and kill our people,"" said Ali al-Mamari, a prominent member of parliament. New al Qaeda video signals new round of plotting . A video recently made public shows what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of al Qaeda in years. In the middle of the clip, the man known as al Qaeda's crown prince, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, appears out in the open, greeting followers in Yemen. Al-Wuhayshi, the No. 2 leader of al Qaeda globally and the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has said he wants to attack the United States. But in the video, he looks unconcerned that he could be hit by an American drone. In a speech to the group, al-Wuhayshi makes it clear that he's going after the United States, saying ""We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!"" The video started appearing on jihadist websites recently, drawing the attention of U.S. officials and global terrorism experts. U.S. officials believe the highly produced video is recent and authentic. With some fighters' faces blurred, there is worry it signals a new round of plotting. Every frame of the video is now being analyzed by the United States. CNN's Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa, Yemen. Barbara Starr reported from Washington.

"(CNN) -- When Josep Maria Bartomeu became the 40th president of FC Barcelona at the start of this year, he was paraded at the Camp Nou stadium in front of the waiting press, just as his predecessors before him had. The president of Barcelona, after all, has an exalted status. Usually they are voted for by the club's socios, or members, the president sets the tone of the club and the scope of its ambition. They are held to account, too, for their behavior off the pitch and results on it. A picture was taken of the 51-year-old engineer and entrepreneur, with the club's famous motto visible in the stadium seats behind him, to his left. Mes Que Un Club. More Than A Club. It is an invocation that sums up how Barcelona's fans and players believe that their club transcends soccer. How it represents a progressive Catalan political and social identity. The shirt was deemed so sacred that, for over a century, no sponsor was allowed to sully its famous stripes. But, in the same picture, to his right, the words ""Qatar Airways"" loom even larger. The same company now graces the front of Barcelona's shirts too. Crossroads . Bartomeu has taken charge of a club standing on the crossroads, not to mention at the end of one of the darkest periods in Barcelona's recent history. In little over a year the club has lost its position as Europe's most feared team, changed its manager, seen another beloved former coach die of cancer, seen Lionel Messi embroiled in an embarrassing tax case and been accused of complicity, at least, in tax avoidance surrounding the transfer deal that brought Brazil star Neymar to Spain. It was that final scandal that saw Bartomeu's predecessor Sandro Rosell resign in disgrace. Bartomeu was his deputy and took over, leaving many Barca fans unhappy they weren't allowed their traditional vote. Factor in the recent signing of Luis Suarez, a player still banned from all soccer related activity after biting a player at the World Cup finals, the third time he has bitten a player in a game during his short career, and the phrase ""Mes Que Un Club,"" for many, seems to be describing a time passed. Now Bartomeu has been charged with steadying the ship and making sure that isn't the case. ""Things have been very difficult for us,"" admits Bartomeu in an exclusive, wide-ranging CNN interview. ""Not only sporting. I mean we also had a lot of things not sporting that has been ... well, developing the club in another way that we were not planning. But everything [that] comes we try to solve."" Season ahead . Given what's on Bartomeu's plate, his immediate focus is the season ahead. After a barren year, and the resignation of former coach Tata Martino, the club has put its faith in former player Luis Enrique, returning to a time when coaches were nurtured and promoted from within. ""I learned very, very much from Pep Guardiola. He is a genius,"" Bartomeu said of Barcelona's former coach who, like Enrique, cut his teeth coaching the Barcelona B team. ""Then after Pep, Tito Vilanova, which was the natural continuation of this project but Tito had very bad medical problems. And (then) came Tata Martino. Tata Martino is a ... well, a coach from Argentina with another way of looking at football."" It was agreed that Martino, after a tough transitional season, would stand down. According to Bartomeu, there was only one choice. ""(Director of football) Zubizarreta told us: 'Luis Enrique is our man. Luis Enrique is our coach,' "" he recalls. ""He has been preparing himself in the last few years for this so we took him."" The Messi factor . There has been a changing of the guard on the pitch as much as off it. The biggest loss has been Carles Puyol, who took over as club captain from Enrique almost a decade ago but has now retired after struggling with injuries. All eyes will be on Lionel Messi, the team's focal point and the embodiment of the club's fortunes. ""It's unlimited,"" Bartomeu replies when asked how much Messi was worth to Barcelona now. ""Leo Messi came to our club when he was 13 years old. This year he will be 27 ... He has been growing within our club. He is one of us. ""Leo Messi represents something more than his goals or the titles he won. Leo Messi represents, a little bit, this spirit of a young player that comes to our Masia, to our youth academy, and learns."" Bartomeu says he is not worried about the tax case, based on offshore payments for image rights, that has dogged Messi since last year. ""That is something that belongs to his personal life, of course,"" Bartomeu says. ""He has our support, our help and, well, he's managing with his advisers, with his lawyers and of course anything he needs Barca is there to help him."" The Neymar deal . But it is another potential court case that has proved even more damaging to Barcelona's reputation. When details of the Neymar transfer deal was made public, with an alleged $10 million shortfall in what was paid and what was declared to the Spanish authorities, it caused a wave of outrage. Bartomeu, however, believes that the club didn't do anything wrong. ""This transfer is being investigated by a judge in Spain and we have different interpretations,"" he says. ""What we did, of course, being prudent as much as possible, we pay taxes in Brazil and also we pay the same taxes in Spain. So we paid twice just to avoid any misunderstandings for the judge. When the truth comes out then Barca will benefit from this truth."" This season Barcelona will try to accommodate three of the finest attacking talents in the world game: Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, even if the club will have to wait for the Uruguayan to serve his four-month ban for biting. ""When we approached Suarez, it was before the World Cup,"" Bartomeu says. ""We told him that he had the right age. He had the experience. Playing at Liverpool give him incredible performance also. And it was the right time for him to come to our club, to Barcelona. ""We knew from a lot of lot of years ago that Luis Suarez likes our club, likes our city. And we have the advantage. His agent is Pep Guardiola's brother ... He's from Barca in his heart, also, so everything was perfect and created the perfect atmosphere that Luis Suarez accepted. And we know that he had better offers than our offer but he came to Barcelona."" Suarez ban . Suarez's bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini became, for many, one of the defining images of the World Cup. But the incident didn't give Bartomeu any second thoughts. ""No, no. We didn't rethink this decision and we told Luis after the bite. He knows he did wrong,"" Bartomeu says. ""He apologized. That's very important for us. That means he knows that he did not do things properly -- and of course, coming to our city, coming to our club, there's going to be a way of managing Luis Suarez, because at Liverpool he was a perfect player. Liverpool fans can tell it, supporters can tell it."" On question remains: How would Barcelona react if he bit someone again? ""This is now a question,"" Bartomeu admits. ""This is a question that a lot of people now ask us. We cannot talk about something that could happen or not. We don't know. What we know is that we accept this responsibility and he also wants this responsibility of bringing Luis Suarez to the family of football."" So confident is Barcelona that Suarez will not err again, Bartomeu has not insisted on a ""no biting"" clause in the contract. ""No, there is no clause,"" he confirms. ""If the clause did exist we wouldn't say it, but it doesn't exist."" Guardiola's return? As the season approaches -- La Liga kicks off on August 23 -- many question marks remain over where Barcelona is headed and whether it is really ""more than a club"" or susceptible to the same shenanigans as any other team in the modern game. Luis Enrique will have to hit the ground running, but Bartomeu believes that the club's special ethos is such that few can resist its gravitational pull, even former coaches like Pep Guardiola. ""Oh I'm sure,"" Bartomeu says when asked whether Guardiola would ever return to Barcelona. ""I'm sure that all the people that are from Barca, they have Barca in their heart, they go back to Barcelona and help the club. It's something that has happened in the past and will continue in the future. ""I always say to a lot of people that I see a future of Barca. I hope that after 2022 ... with a lot of players that are right now playing or players that are training other teams, coming back to our team as coaches, as a sport director, as members or as presidents of the club. ""Because at the end, we are like a family."" Read Is Barcelona becoming 'Less of a Club'?","Barcelona president admits past year has been ""very difficult""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Ryan O'Neal told a jury on Monday that he is the rightful owner of an Andy Warhol celebrity portrait that hangs over his bed. It is of the woman he considers the love of his life, ""Charlie's Angels"" star Farrah Fawcett. Fawcett, who died of cancer in 2009, bequeathed her art collection to her alma mater, the University of Texas at Austin; the university is accusing O'Neal of stealing away with its Warhol. ""The painting is mine,"" testified the 72-year-old actor, who rose to fame as the impossibly handsome star of the 1960s television soap opera ""Peyton Place"" and the 1970 film ""Love Story."" He admitted taking the portrait, a striking black and white print with ruby red lips and turquoise eyes, from a wall outside the bedroom of Fawcett's Wilshire Boulevard condominium about a week after her death on June 25, 2009. ""I removed the painting a week or more after she died,"" he testified. Remembering Farrah Fawcett . The portrait now hangs over O'Neal's bed at his Malibu beach house -- just as it did from 1980 until 1998. Over the heated objections of O'Neal's lawyer, Marty Singer, the jury heard about how the portrait came to leave the beach house in the wake of the couple's infamous ""falling out"" in February 1997. The love affair between two baby boomer icons hit an extremely rough patch when she walked in on him in bed with a much younger woman. ""That person that was in her -- in your beach house at the time was 25 years old, right?"" an attorney for the university, David Beck, asked. Singer's objection was sustained before O'Neal could answer. Beck persisted, asking if Fawcett was ""furious."" ""No,"" O'Neal responded. ""She was hurt. She was in shock."" He added that she felt ""pitiful and disgraced."" Beck pushed on, asking whether the portrait was hanging over his bed at the time. ""It was,"" O'Neal acknowledged. But not for much longer. O'Neal battling prostate cancer . ""About a year after the incident I asked her to keep the portrait with her, store it for me, because my young friend was uncomfortable with Farrah staring at her,"" O'Neal testified. Fawcett's response, according to his testimony: ""I'd like you to leave it there because I want to make her uncomfortable."" By the time Fawcett moved into her L.A. condo in 1999, she had possession of the Warhol portrait -- as well as a twin print Warhol created at the same time. O'Neal insisted they reconciled a couple of years later. ""She forgave me."" Like so many of the facts in this case, the impetus for Fawcett's turn as a model for Warhol is in dispute. O'Neal says Warhol, an old friend of many years, approached him in 1980, about a year after he started seeing Fawcett. By then she was already famous for her role on ""Charlie's Angels"" and that ubiquitous red bathing suit pin-up poster. Farrah taken too soon . But Beck has suggested another scenario. He says Warhol approached Fawcett directly, at a luncheon at a Houston country club. Both O'Neal and Fawcett attended the two-hour session at Warhol's New York studio, known as The Factory. Dozens of Polaroid photographs were taken, but there wasn't much fuss. ""It didn't take long,"" O'Neal said. ""Doing her hair took longer than taking the pictures."" Later, he said, he received a call to pick up the paintings and saw them stacked with several others, including portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. O'Neal said he and Fawcett each received a painting as part of the deal. They carried them out and loaded them into a Checker cab. And so, O'Neal said, he can't steal what's already his. He also said it was his idea that Fawcett leave her art to the University of Texas, but that the Warhol portraits weren't part of the plan. O'Neal: I failed Farrah . The university sued O'Neal first, demanding in 2011 that he turn over the portrait so it could be displayed with its twin. The actor countersued, in turn seeking a court order giving him a tablecloth Warhol decorated with painted hearts. It is included in the Fawcett collection, but O'Neal insists Warhol painted it for both of them. The other portrait, which differs slightly from the one in O'Neal's beach house, hangs in the university's Blanton Museum of Art in Austin. Singer says the university's insistence on possessing both portraits is financially motivated, but O'Neal just wants to pass the portrait on to the couple's son, Redmond. That legacy brought the day's most emotional testimony. O'Neal struggled to maintain his composure as he read a letter Fawcett wrote their son at Christmas 2007, after her cancer was diagnosed. She had wanted to make him a sculpture as a gift but was too weak to complete it. ""Redmond,"" her letter began, ""It is important that you know that not only on this Christmas Day but in all that days since you were born and in all the years that follow, you, sweet boy, are the love of my life. My most special gift from God. I look at life differently now since I became ill. I look at every day with appreciation and gratefulness. It changed my outlook knowing that life could be taken away so easily. There is a quote that has more meaning to me now and I hope you will be able to use it at 22 years old instead of 60 years old. 'You don't get to choose how or when you are going to die. You can only decide how you are going to live.' I don't want any regrets because I waited too long. Life is a miraculous gift and as your mother I want to guide you to appreciate yours."" O'Neal was the first witness to take the stand Monday morning, followed by a high-end mover who handled both Warhols when Fawcett moved into the condo in 1999. Craig Nevius, a television producer who worked with Fawcett on the reality show ""Chasing Farrah,"" occupied much of the afternoon and is expected to return to the witness stand on Tuesday, when jurors will be shown video excerpts that include a trip with a celebrity auctioneer to a storage facility to view one of the Warhol portraits, Fawcett's famous red tank suit and other memorabilia.

"Tunica, Mississippi (CNN) -- As a historic crest of the swollen Mississippi River rolls southward, residents throughout the river region are on high alert and braced for the possibility of more flooding in the days ahead. Residents and officials are especially concerned about the Morganza Spillway above Baton Rouge, which was last opened in 1973. Opening it could help spare Baton Rouge and New Orleans from some damage, but it would flood populated and rural areas in the swampy Atchafalaya Basin. The basin is home to the Atchafalaya River and myriad tributaries. In Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, residents of towns emptied out by the waters of the Mississippi faced flood recovery even as they still remembered too well a series of earlier natural disasters. ""I went through (Hurricane) Katrina,"" said Lynn Magnuson, a New Orleans resident.  ""I would not wish flooding on anyone, and this city is the last place on Earth that needs any more high water."" The river crested Tuesday at Memphis, Tennessee, just short of a record set in 1937. ""We've never seen anything like this, I was scared not knowing what's going to happen or where we can go from here,"" said flood victim Tamara Jenkins of Frayser, Tennessee, who was evacuated from her house on Tuesday. Fourteen Mississippi counties affected by flooding have been declared major disaster areas eligible for federal assistance, Gov. Haley Barbour announced Wednesday in a statement released by his office. ""We are grateful to President (Barack) Obama and FEMA for quickly fulfilling our request for assistance,"" Barbour said. ""The flooding situation will last for several weeks, and this declaration gives Mississippians in flooded areas access to federal assistance that can help families through this difficult time,"" he added. The river in Memphis measured 47.8 feet Tuesday night, according to the National Weather Service.  Flood stage in Memphis is 34 feet. In Natchez, Mississippi, the river surpassed its record early Wednesday, exceeding 58 feet.  Forecasts predict the river will crest in Natchez on May 21 at an overwhelming 64 feet. Flood stage in Natchez is 48 feet. Mississippi has already had to close some of its casinos at Tunica, a key economic driver in that part of the state. Additionally, the Rainbow Casino in Vicksburg, Mississippi, was closed Wednesday. Only the Ameristar and Riverwalk casinos remain open. ""The gaming commission is conducting daily assessments at the casinos to determine their status,"" said Allen Godfrey, deputy director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. About 600 people in the community of Cutoff in Tunica have been driven from their homes, said Larry Liddell, a county spokesman. ""My house is completely submerged. You can't even see it from a photograph,"" said Michael Dewes, who fled the Cutoff community and is staying in a shelter.  ""It's completely gone."" In Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal said as many as 3 million acres could be affected by the flooding. Some 500 National Guard members have been mobilized so far, and 21 parishes have issued emergency declarations. The river's crest is expected to begin arriving in Louisiana next week.  Flooding is expected to be a major setback in the southern part of the state. ""After hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike -- as well as the oil spill -- Louisiana can ill-afford another large-scale disaster,"" said Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat.  ""Billions of dollars in property is at stake, not to mention the threat to human life."" The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it was closing a major lock that allows for the transfer of barge traffic between the Mississippi and the Red River Basin. The Corps opened 38 more spill gates to the Bonnet Carre Spillway in Norco, Louisiana, north of New Orleans on Wednesday, sending millions of gallons of water rushing into Lake Pontchartrain and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico. On Monday, 28 gates were opened and an additional 44 gates were opened on Tuesday to divert floodwater. As the swollen waters inch closer, anxious Louisiana residents are demanding answers. Some have posted on Facebook pages operated by the Corps, demanding answers about when certain spillways will be opened and what other areas are facing flooding. In Arkansas, meanwhile, the Farm Bureau estimated damage to the state agriculture could top $500 million as more than a million acres of cropland are under water. In Helena, Arkansas, the river was at over 56 feet Wednesday. Flood level in Helena is 44 feet. A crest is defined as the high point of the water during a flood before it begins to recede. Observers generally know that cresting is occurring when the gradual rise stops and the water level becomes stable. The crest is estimated to be in New Orleans on May 23, Jindal said. President Barack Obama has signed disaster declarations for Tennessee, which will help direct federal aid toward recovery efforts in areas hit by severe storms, flooding and tornadoes. Flooding also continues to be a problem in southeastern Missouri and southern Illinois, though the Mississippi and Ohio rivers have already crested in those states. The 4,800-foot spillway includes 125 gate bays, said operations manager Russell Beauvais.  In 1973, 42 of them were opened. At a news conference in Louisiana on Wednesday, Louisiana's Jindal said the decision on whether to open the Morganza Spillway is still under way but a ""necessary step."" The current flow is at 1.36 million cubic feet per second but when the river's flow reaches 1.5 million cubic feet of water per second at Louisiana's Red River Landing, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will open the spillway and send a torrent of water down the Atchafalaya River, Jindal said. The Corp predicts the opening threshold will be reached sometime between Saturday and Tuesday. ""If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decides to open the Morganza Spillway, it could take approximately a week from the day they start, and roughly 3,900 people and 2,600 structures would be impacted in by the high water,"" Jindal said. After gates are opened, Beauvais said, it would take about three days for the water to fully reach Morgan City, a town of about 12,000 near the coast. CNN's Dave Alsup, Craig Bell, Ed Lavandera and Tracy Sabo contributed to this report.","NEW: 14 Mississippi counties are declared major disaster areas .

"(CNN) -- Don't feed the bears! It's an admonishment heard over and over again from wildlife officials. But Florida resident Mary Musselman didn't listen, officials said. And it got her arrested at age 81. She is being held without bond, CNN affiliate WFTS reported. ""I think it is outrageous,"" said Karen Tedder. She and other former students of the retired gym teacher held a gathering Thursday outside Musselman's house in Sebring to pray for her. She must be released, they say, because her husband is dying of cancer and she's his only caregiver. But authorities had warned her multiple times not to feed the black bears coming onto her property. She did anyway. And she fed them a lot -- up to 17 to 18 bowls of dog food at a time, wildlife officials told the affiliate. The bears loved it and kept coming back. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission hated it and kept coming back, too. Killing a bear . Musselman's trouble with the law began last year, when wildlife officials had to put down a bear she was feeding, they said. They went to great lengths to explain to her why she shouldn't give the wild animals food, said FWC spokesman Gary Morse. They brought her informational videos and pamphlets, had conversations with her. ""Feeding bears results in bears losing their fear of people,"" Morse said. After they get used to living around humans and getting food from them, relocating them does not solve the problem. And when bears come too close to people, they do damage -- to property and to people, Morse said. The education they gave Musselman was all for naught. ""She told us she wasn't going to stop,"" Morse told the affiliate. Then, in November, they issued her an official warning. Weeks later, officers caught her feeding bears again. Out came the instructional videos once more. Still no change. The law steps in . In December, Musselman was ordered to appear in court, where -- this time -- a judge told her to stop feeding the bears. That didn't work either. On Christmas Eve, she was back in court; she left there on probation. Again, the problem persisted: More food; more bears. A judge sent wildlife commission officers to arrest Musselman. They said she fought them and told them she'd kill them. Now she is charged not only with feeding wildlife but also with battery against a law officer and violating her probation. Why wouldn't she stop? She thought the bears would starve without her, according to the affiliate. ""She didn't want to accept that fact that they'd be fine without her,"" Morse said. ""They hibernate when there is no food."" Her former students are trying to find a mental health professional to appear with her in court. Warm winters spur black bears to halt hibernating, start eating . CNN's Darrell Calhoun contributed to this report .","Mary Musselman put out 17-18 bowls of dog food at a time for black bears .
Officials tried to educate her on why she should not do it .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Monitoring the immigration crisis requires keeping one eye on Washington and one on the U.S.-Mexico border. One place is full of corrupt and mercenary characters who protect their interests, don't follow the rules, play with people's lives and who only care about making money and amassing power and ensuring their own survival. Then you have the border. Alarmed over tens of thousands of child refugees coming into the United States, House Republicans last week sent up a flare -- and wound up setting themselves on fire. With the Senate in recess until after Labor Day, Republicans approved a pair of show bills. The first bill -- a $694 million emergency spending measure to deal with the border crisis and approved by a 223-189 vote -- showed that House Speaker John Boehner could muster just enough support to overcome meddling by outsiders. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Jeff Sessions of Alabama lobbied to defeat the measure because they wanted to preserve the narrative that President Obama is solely to blame for the fact that at least 57,000 unaccompanied minors from Central America have streamed across the U.S-Mexico border since October 2013. They wanted to punish Obama by denying resources to house and care for the children. The second bill showed Latino immigrants how much contempt the GOP has for them. By a vote of 216-192, House Republicans and four Democrats -- Reps. John Barrow of Georiga, Nick Rahall from West Virginia, Mike McIntyre of North Carolina and Collin Peterson of Minnesota -- voted out of spite to end the administration's policy offering Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. For Republicans, it was a chance to use the border crisis to attack a dispensation they never liked which offers more than half a million undocumented young people a two-year reprieve from deportation. The bill will never become law, but the damage is done -- to the Republican Party. As if Latinos didn't have enough reasons to hate the GOP, the attack on the DREAM'ers gives them a fresh batch. Ironically, in 2016, that could benefit Hillary Clinton, who has decided that on the issue of the refugee children she is pro-choice. Unfortunately, it is multiple choice. In June, Clinton said in a CNN interview that the border kids ""should be sent back."" Then, in July, during an interview on Fusion -- the liberal cable network co-owned by ABC News and Univision and aimed at English-speaking Latinos -- Clinton claimed that she was talking about ""migrant children"" not ""refugee children."" Someone please tell her that Latinos are fond of both. If children don't have a claim to asylum or family members in the United States, Clinton told Jorge Ramos, they should be returned. Never mind that the kids would be going back into darkness. Democrats call this a humanitarian crisis. How do you humanely hand a death sentence to an 8-year-old? ""We send kids back all the time,"" Clinton said coldly. And to think, this woman began her career protecting children in America. Now that she's a politician, she thinks it's her job to protect America from children. Still, Clinton insisted, the United States could help set up a screening process in countries like Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to determine whether children qualify for asylum. In her clumsiness on immigration, Clinton takes after Obama, whose handling of the issue -- in a recent poll from AP-GfK -- earned the disapproval of 68% of Americans. Only 31% approve of the job he's doing. That's what happens when you can't decide whether you want to be tough or compassionate. No matter. Clinton, Obama and other Democrats have secret weapons. They're called Republicans. In this go-around, the Democrats played the opposition masterfully. Obama made an initial misstep, saying what Clinton said -- that the kids had to go home -- and setting in motion plans for their expedited removal, without due process. Then he got smart and returned to the Democratic script of doing nothing and watching the GOP implode. In the new narrative, Obama and other Democrats were actually seen by many Latinos as the good guys, fighting the good fight against those evil Republicans who wanted to send the kids back home. To think Republicans swallowed the line about how Obama was going to take executive action to loosen immigration laws. Would this be the same Obama who spent the last five and a half years fighting with immigration activists and insisting he didn't have this power? He never wanted to use it before. Why use it now? Democrats set a clever trap, and Republicans walked into it. The GOP will pay for that mistake for years, and deservedly so. The rest of us learned a lesson. The next time we face a crisis where desperate people fleeing violence and oppression look to us for help, the most we can hope for is that Congress do what's best for all concerned -- and stay out of it.","House votes for spending bill on border crisis and against reprieve program for ""dreamers""

"(CNN) -- The pilot at the helm of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was training to fly a Boeing 777 and was sitting next to a man in his first trip as an instructor pilot when their plane's main landing gear hit a seawall around San Francisco's airport, a U.S. official said Tuesday. Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, revealed these and other details during a news conference that included information about the pilots and their flying experience, based on the interviews they've conducted with investigators. Having finished classroom and simulator training, the ""flying pilot"" -- as Hersman referred to him -- was in the piloting portion of his training to fly a Boeing 777 at the time of Saturday's crash. He had flown 10 legs and had about 35 hours of flying time with the 777, which put him about halfway through the training required by Asiana of 20 legs and 60 flight hours, when the plane went down, Hersman said. Did pilot have enough 777 experience? Sitting beside him during Saturday's flight from Seoul to San Francisco was the instructor pilot. The trip across the Pacific was the first time he had been an instructor pilot and the first time he'd traveled with the flying pilot, according to Hersman. That seemingly uneventful, more than 10-hour flight ended in a few chaotic, panicked minutes of fury, after which two people were dead and 182 others were transported to local hospitals. ""Sections of the cabin ... are found very early in the debris field,"" said Hersman, who had walked a few hundred feet from the seawall where the plane's landing gear and then tail first slammed into the seawall to where it mercifully came to a rest. ""You can see aircraft parts, gallery materials, newspapers, magazines and flooring."" According to the pilots' accounts, the tensions started before the plane touched ground. The three pilots in the cockpit -- another was in the cabin -- told investigators they set the ""auto throttle"" speed to 137 knots (157 mph), which is the speed it should have been going. Akin to cruise control, auto throttles are used to maintain a plane's speed. At 200 feet above ground, the instructor pilot said he noted precision approach path indicator lights indicated the giant jet was too low. It was then ""he recognized that the auto throttles were not maintaining speed, and he established a go-around attitude,"" said the NTSB chief. ""He went to push the throttles forward, but he stated that the other pilot had already (done so)."" Hersman cautioned anyone from jumping to conclusions as to whether a mechanical or pilot error is to blame for the crash. She also spoke specifically about the auto throttles, saying investigators were delving into how they were working and how they were used. But Hersman also stated: ""The crew is required to maintain a safe aircraft ... One of the very critical things that needs to be monitored on an approach to landing is speed. So we need to understand what was going on in the cockpit, and also what was going on in the aircraft."" 2 dead, 182 injured -- including 2 ejected flight attendants . When it departed South Korea, Flight 214 had 307 passengers and crew aboard. Despite the scale of the wreckage -- a hole burned through much of the cabin's roof and the aircraft's back half lopped off -- 123 walked away. Others weren't so lucky, most of all the two Chinese teenagers who died in the crash. Girls killed in crash were headed for camp . Those working on the flight were among the injured. The third pilot in the cockpit cracked a rib. One flight attendant was temporarily trapped by an evacuation chute that opened inside the plane. Two other flight attendants were not in their seats at the rear of the aircraft when the plane finally ground to a halt, because they were ejected as the aircraft broke up. ""They were found down the runway and off to the side of the runway,"" Hersman said. Flight attendants hailed as heroes . Many of those hospitalized have been released. At San Francisco General Hospital, for instance, 50 of the 62 patients are now free to go home. But others still require care. Four adults and one child in critical condition are still at San Francisco General suffering from internal bleeding, fractures and spinal cord, abdominal and traumatic brain injuries, according to the hospital. Crew recall plane being too high, then too low . The ""flying pilot"" and ""instructor pilot"" who were in the front seat of the cockpit were not among the injured, according to Hersman. Asiana hired the flying pilot in 1994, after which he reported amassing nearly 10,000 hours of total flight time. That experience included time piloting 737, 747 and A-320 aircraft, and he was a ground school and simulator instructor for the latter model. The instructor pilot, a South Korean air force veteran with about 13,000 hours of flight experience, recalled Flight 214 being ""slightly high when they passed 4,000 feet (and) they set vertical speed mode at about 1,500 feet per minute,"" explained Hersman. But they ended up coming in low. The third pilot in the cockpit told investigators that, with ""the nose ... pitched up, ... he could not see the runway,"" said the NTSB chief. In the last few hundred feet before touchdown, the crew was making both lateral and vertical adjustments -- meaning they were both trying to move sideways to get toward the runway and adjust their height. Shock and survival: Plane crash through the eyes of children . When the aircraft hit, it spun 360 degrees. An oil tank ruptured and leaked fuel onto the plane's right engine, starting a fire. Eventually, evacuation chutes deployed, and at least seven of the aircraft's eight doors were opened. (An eighth was found on the ground, Hersman explained.) Very soon after the plane stopped, tending to the wounded and the investigation began. That probe will continue for months, though authorities have released significant details so far. So much information, in fact, the Air Line Pilots Association, for a second straight day on Tuesday, criticized what it called the ""NTSB's release of incomplete, out-of-context information"" that ""has fueled rampant speculation about the cause of the accident."" First responders describe eerie, chaotic moments after crash . The union further questioned whether some tools were available to the crew, claiming, for instance, that the ""Instrument Landing System, a critical aid to pilots, (was) out of service."" ""Without the full body of facts surrounding a catastrophic event, partial or incomplete information can lead to erroneous conclusions and, in turn, skew the perception of individuals' behavior,"" the pilots union said in its Tuesday statement. ""This could then lead to misguided assessments of the crew's intentions and actions."" Hersman disputed the union's claims earlier Tuesday on CNN, saying the agency believes that transparent release of information is crucial. ""We believe that it is always better to put out the correct information and factual information so that bad information is not able to propagate,"" she said. Aviation experts say that air crashes often involve several factors, and the San Francisco tragedy appears to be following form. Experience, training, crew actions, airport navigation, and now the possible role of a mechanical system are all in the mix. The NTSB is not expected to render a decision on probable cause for months. During her news conference later Tuesday, Hersman stressed that ""there's still a lot of work to be done."" ""We will not determine probable cause while we are here on scene,"" she said, adding there's a lot of information to collect and analyze.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two California residents are suing Anheuser-Busch, alleging the company waters down Budweiser and other beers ""significantly"" to boost profits, their attorneys announced Tuesday. The class-action lawsuit alleges that the maker of the ""King of Beers"" has the technology to precisely control the amount of alcohol in its beers but adds water so the alcohol is well below the advertised figure of 5% by volume, the suit said. ""There are no impediments -- economic, practical or legal -- to AB accurately labeling its products to reflect their true alcohol content,"" the 18-page lawsuit said. ""Nevertheless, AB uniformly misrepresents and overstates that content."" The beer maker rejected the lawsuit's allegations. ""The claims against Anheuser-Busch are completely false, and these lawsuits are groundless,"" said Peter Kraemer, vice president of brewing and supply for Anheuser-Busch. ""Our beers are in full compliance with all alcohol labeling laws. ""We proudly adhere to the highest standards in brewing our beers, which have made them the best-selling in the U.S. and the world,"" he said. The lawsuit alleges the other watered-down beers are Bud Ice, Bud Lite Platinum, Michelob, Michelob Ultra, Hurricane High Gravity Lager, King Cobra, Busch Ice, Natural Ice and Bud Light Lime. But the suit doesn't provide figures for the allegedly watered-down alcohol content. Nina Giampaoli and John Elbert, who reside in Sonoma County, California, are the plaintiffs who say they stopped buying Budweiser after learning of the alleged mislabeling, the suit said. Their suit, filed last week in federal court in San Francisco, alleges violations of California's consumer protection laws and Missouri's Merchandising Practices Act. ""I think it's wrong for huge corporations to lie to their loyal customers -- I really feel cheated,"" Giampaoli said in a statement. ""No matter what the product is, people should be able to rely on the information companies put on their labels."" The company's parent, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, is the world's largest producer of alcoholic beverages and made more than 10 billion gallons of malt libations in 2011, generating gross profits of more than $22 billion, the lawsuit said. The parent company's 13 U.S. breweries alone produced more than 3 billion gallons of alcoholic beverages in 2011, and Anheuser Busch has a 47.7% market share of the U.S. sale of beer, the suit said. ""Because water is cheaper than alcohol, AB adds extra water to its finished products to produce malt beverages that consistently have lower alcohol content than the percentage displayed on its labels,"" the suit said. ""By doing so, AB is able to produce a significantly higher number of units of beer from the same starting batch of ingredients. ""AB never intends for the malt beverage to possess the amount of alcohol that is stated on the label. As a result, AB's customers are overcharged for watered-down beer and AB is unjustly enriched by the additional volume it can sell,"" the suit said. The lawsuit, which says the matter in controversy exceeds $5 million, seeks unspecified amounts for compensatory and exemplary damages and asks the court to require the beer makers ""to fund a corrective advertising campaign,"" the suit said. In the aftermath of the lawsuit's announcement, National Public Radio and CNN affiliate KSDK conducted independent lab tests this week on samples of some Anheuser-Busch InBev beers and found their alcohol content matched the amount stated on the label.

"Perris, California (CNN) -- No one has ever intentionally taken a nose dive off the roof of the world before. In the 61 years since Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay reached the top of Mount Everest, most of the 5,000-plus people have descended from the summit the same way they came up: on foot. A few have paraglided down. Joby Ogwyn has other plans. Everest men: On top of the world in 1963 .

I'm not afraid to live my life on my own terms. And this is my dream and I am willing to risk everything to make it happen."" It's not like the 39-year-old Ogwyn is unfamiliar with the 29,035-foot tall mountain. He was 24 the first time he reached the summit, which at the time made him the youngest American to do so.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Cannibalism, Tasmanian tigers and a good dose of Australian humor: These are the ingredients of the latest film from down under, the intriguingly titled ""Dying Breed."" Left to right: producer Rod Morris, writer/producer Michael Boughan, director Jody Dwyer, and actors Nathan Phillips and Leigh Whannell . The film is inspired by the story of Alexander ""Pieman"" Pierce, who, in the 1820s, escaped from one of the most feared penal colonies in Tasmania and survived in the bush by eating his fellow escapees. ""Dying Breed"" suggests that ""Pieman"" Pierce's descendents today live deep in the jungle, feeding off the flesh of innocent travelers. Director, Jody Dwyer, Australia-born but raised in the UK, hopes that his first feature-length film has managed to steer clear of typical horror cliches. ""You have to acknowledge there is a certain formula [to the horror genre], but at the same time you need a point of difference. I wanted to present characters that were credible, that had depth,"" he told CNN. To further break away from convention, Dwyer has tried to make sure that this is not a typical Australian film. The cast don't ""feel"" Australian and it is set in lush jungle, not a red desert. The Australian lead sports an Irish accent, while in the jungle of Tasmania there isn't a kangaroo or cork hat in sight. ""I was very conscious of giving it a commercially viable feel by being international without being parochial,"" Dwyer explained. ""I think there is a real danger of Australian films becoming particularly art house because they present Aussies as battlers of the outback."" Dwyer questions whether Baz Lurhman's upcoming blockbuster, ""Australia,"" is doing anything to change this image: ""That movie deals with the slightly stereotypical image of Australia being a land of the farmer and the ground and the cattle,"" he told CNN. ""Dying Breed,"" as a horror, is already breaking from what most people consider an Australian film. ""Crocodile Dundee,"" ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" and ""Muriel's Wedding"" are the films typically associated with the Australian film industry. But comedy's hold on Australia has loosened in recent years. Since 2000 Australia has produced a series of successful horror flicks, culminating in 2005's ""Wolf Creek."" Made for a mere $1 million, it became the highest grossing Australian horror film of all time, making over $16 million at the U.S. box office alone. Neighboring New Zealand has also had a run of successful horror films in recent years. Before Peter Jackson took over Hollywood with his band of hobbits, he made his name in his homeland with 80's classic gore-fests, ""Bad Taste"" and ""Braindead."" A huge success internationally, the films have since spawned a whole generation of new horror directors in New Zealand. Even after nearly twenty years, Jackson's films remain hugely influential. 2006's ""Black Sheep,"" a film about genetically modified killer sheep, owed much to ""Braindead"" and used Jackson's special effects company, Weta Workshop. Horror has also seen a revival globally. ""Saw"", written by Dying Breed's own Leigh Whannell, grossed $55 million in the United States and has since spawned three sequels. The popularity of the series generated numerous other torture fests that seem to develop increasingly elaborate ways to mutilate hapless teenagers. It is a tough ask to make your film stand out in such a saturated market, and you have to wonder how a film that in essence deals with four adults going out into a haunted wilderness can really be unique. Dwyer believes he's done that by focusing on the film's characters: ""A community that seems normal but has some twisted alternative philosophy, which makes a much more horrific film,"" he grins. And Dwyer believes the setting has helped. Tasmania, an island that has rarely featured in films, has a rich history and a varied landscape. Would Dwyer, after spending so much time on the island, recommend it as place to visit? ""Bits of Tasmania are phenomenal in their beauty,"" he said. ""With that hanging mist, steep gradients and valleys, it's truly mythical.""","""Dying Breed"" is an Australian horror film set in the Tasmanian jungle .

"(CNN) -- The three soldiers killed Wednesday at Fort Hood, Texas, came from different places. Two grew up in small towns, and one came from a seaside city in Puerto Rico. They all died in a shooting rampage that also left 16 others wounded. Sgt. 1st Class Danny Ferguson . Ferguson was killed trying to hold a door shut to stop the shooter, his fiancÃ©e, Kristen Haley,  told CNN affiliate WTSP-TV in Tampa, Florida. ""He held that door shut because it wouldn't lock. It seems the doors would be bullet proof, but apparently they're not,"" Haley told the station. ""If he wasn't the one standing there holding those doors closed, that shooter would have been able to get through and shoot everyone else."" Haley, also a soldier, said Ferguson was a native of Mulberry, Florida, and an outstanding athlete at Mulberry High, where he graduated in 1993. The small town is about 30 miles east of Tampa. He'd just returned from Afghanistan, she said. ""This was his life. He was proud to be part of a great service,"" Haley told WTSP. CNN also spoke to Ferguson's parents in the Tampa Bay area. They declined to comment. Staff Sgt. Carlos A. Lazaney-Rodriguez . Lazaney-Rodriguez, 38, was from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, and planned to retire from the military soon after serving 20 years, Aguadilla Mayor Carlos Mendez told CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Mayra Cuevas. ""It was a very close-knit family,"" Mendez said ""Excellent, decent, very good people. I know his family and his parents. They are good people."" Lazaney-Rodriguez graduated from high school in Aguadilla and enlisted at 18, Cuevas reported. He had a wife and family. Aguadilla, a town of about 60,000 people, is on the northwest corner of Puerto Rico. His immediate family, including his father and three brothers, lives in Tampa, Cuevas reported, and his aunt still lives in Aguadilla. ""His aunt was destroyed; she almost couldn't speak,"" Mendez said. ""They weren't expecting this. It is a pity that seven months before that he was meant to leave the Army something like this happens."" Sgt. Timothy Owens . Owens, 37, was a counselor in the Army and had served in Iraq. ""Very terrible that they had to shoot my son,"" his mother, Mary Muntean, told CNN affiliate WICS-TV in Springfield, Illinois. ""He was a good person. Why would they shoot a good person that was helping them?"" Owens grew up in Effingham, a town of about 12,000 people in central Illinois. He got married in August and had two teenagers from earlier relationships, WICS reported. Owens loved the military and planned to make it his career, his mother told the station. ""He didn't answer the phone so I left a message on his phone. 'Son, call me so I know if you're OK or not.' Well, never got no call from him. I thought: 'Oh God, please don't let it be,' "" his mother said. The wounded . Three patients previously listed in critical condition at Scott & White Memorial Hospital have been upgraded to fair condition, according to the hospital's Twitter account. One other patient at the hospital is expected to be released Friday, the hospital said. Five others who were wounded had been released from Scott & White by Friday. One of the wounded was identified as Maj. Patrick Miller of Allegany, New York, according to CNN affiliate WGRZ-TV in Buffalo. Friends said Miller, 32, is expected to make a full recovery after the gunman shot him in the abdomen. Miller's hometown buddies organized a prayer service at the Allegany Baptist Church on Thursday night, WGRZ reported. ""He's like a brother,"" his friend Dustin Bottone said.

"TEL AVIV, Israel (CNN) -- Keep your shoes and belts on: Waiting in long airport security lines to pass through metal detectors may soon be a thing of the past. Airport security checkpoints may become opportunities for screeners to study passengers' intentions. Security experts say focus is shifting from analyzing the content of carry-ons to analyzing the content of passengers' intentions and emotions. ""We are seeing a needed paradigm shift when it comes to security,"" says Omer Laviv, CEO of ATHENA GS3, an Israeli-based security company. ""This 'brain-fingerprinting,' or technology which checks for behavioral intent, is much more developed than we think."" Nowhere is the need for cutting-edge security more acute than Israel, which faces constant security threats. For this reason, Israel has become a leader in developing security technology. Several Israeli-based technology companies are developing detection systems that pick up signs of emotional strain, a psychological red flag that a passenger may intend to commit an act of terror. Speedier and less intrusive than metal detectors, these systems may eventually restore some efficiency to the airplane boarding process. One firm, WeCU (pronounced ""We See You"") Technologies, employs a combination of infra-red technology, remote sensors and imagers, and flashing of subliminal images, such as a photo of Osama bin Laden. Developers say the combination of these technologies can detect a person's reaction to certain stimuli by reading body temperature, heart rate and respiration, signals a terrorist unwittingly emits before he plans to commit an attack. With these technologies, the emphasis is on speed and seamlessness. Ehud Givon, CEO of WeCU, envisions a day when a passenger can breeze through a security checkpoint in 20 to 30 seconds. Although traditional security profiling can discriminate by race and religion, security experts say behavioral profiling is more fair, more effective and less expensive. WeCU has received grants from the Transportation Security Administration within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which hopes to implement a system to pinpoint internal threats such as airline employees intending terrorist acts. Once these technologies are in place, a passenger may pass through a security screening without realizing it. For example, passengers could use an automated check-in system or gaze at a screen with departures information without realizing they've just been exposed to the words ""Islamic jihad"" written in Arabic. These stimuli, explains Givon, will intrinsically elicit some sort of biometric response -- whether the passenger knows it or not -- that can be picked up by WeCU's strategically placed sensors. ""I believe that we introduce a new layer in security,"" Givon says. ""This is something that couldn't be done in the past: finding the connection between a certain individual and the intent to harm."" The Orwellian-sounding startup has gone further to develop a system that detects a passenger's behavioral intentions by scanning their every step, literally. While walking around certain parts of the airport terminal, a passenger may not realize he has stepped on a ""smart carpet"" filled with hidden biometric sensors. The technology is still under development, says Givon, who believes it will be strong enough to pick up biometric information from a footstep. If a passenger is wearing heavy hiking boots, for example, WeCU will rely on biometric sensors combined with video and thermal biometric imaging to detect malicious intent. Another option from WeCU is a ""smart seat,"" or cushion full of hidden biometric sensors that could provide a more detailed read on someone sitting in an airport waiting area, Givon says. While the technology sound like something from a James Bond flick or even ""A Clockwork Orange,"" Givon insists that passengers will not find the techniques intrusive. ""We don't want you to feel that you are being interrogated,"" he says. Givon is negotiating contracts with airports worldwide and believes his company's technology may be implemented as soon as 2010. Nemesysco, another Israeli-based technology company, believes the key to a person's emotions and intentions lies in their voice. The company's patented LVA, or Layered Voice Analysis, technology can pick up verbal cues from a passenger who may pose a threat. Unlike a polygraph test, which checks for lies, Nemesysco's systems work as an ""emotion detector,"" says Nemesysco CEO Amir Liberman. In other words, it's not what passengers say, but how they say it. Nemesysco's devices use a series of patented signal-processing algorithms that can differentiate between a ""normal"" voice and a""'stressed"" voice. If emotional stress is detected, officials can determine if the passenger should be taken aside for further questioning. The system works on the premise that all voices have a certain frequency, and any deviation of that baseline frequency can indicate stress. Liberman says it takes approximately five to 10 seconds for their system to capture a ""normal"" voice in casual conversation, which establishes a baseline. Their system then measures changes from the baseline voice that signify an increase in stress, excitement, anticipation, hesitation or other emotions that can indicate a potential terrorism threat. A computer processes the voice patterns and then flashes words such as ""high risk,"" ""medium risk,"" ""excited"" and ""highly stressed."" Through his system, Liberman says, he ""can see what's going on in your brain."" Versions of Nemesysco's system already have been successfully tested at Moscow Domodedovo International Airport, where officials used it to target criminals and drug traffickers. A version was recently implemented at another major international airport which Liberman declined to identify. Layered Voice Analysis also has been used to test for insurance fraud and on the TV program ""Big Brother Australia."" Layered Voice Analysis has limitations, including the inability to trace the vocal patterns of a person with a speech impediment. But the system is more effective than current security measures, claims Liberman, who believes a terrorist currently can pass through airport security with explosive material ""that can take down any plane."" In fact, many experts express little confidence in the current state of airport security. Philip Baum, London-based editor of Aviation Security International magazine, says would-be terrorists could easily slip through security checkpoints, even with new regulations that check for liquids. ""The archaic system of an X-ray machine and metal detector cannot pick up other potential threats posed by passengers,"" Baum says. ""I can have a ceramic weapon or chemical weapons and walk through an archway metal detector and it won't be picked up. Yet we have huge faith in these metal detectors that can only pick up one substance."" Laviv, whose consulting firm focuses on securing mass transportation systems, is equally skeptical. ""It is possible today to hijack an aircraft using only five or six able-bodied passengers who are well-trained in Kung Fu fighting,"" he says. ""There is no technology in place in airports to detect a threat like that. ""The question is, should our desire be to look for each and every threat agent, rather than focus our efforts on identifying the [violent] intention of the passenger?""","Airport security screeners' focus is shifting towards studying passengers' intentions .

Systems can detect signs of emotional strain, which may signal a passenger's intent .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When it comes to making movies, Australia would appear to have it all. Baz Luhrmann's latest film ""Australia"" starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman is the first identifiably Australian blockbuster. A huge landmass with a location for every movie eventuality, from the post-apocalyptic desert seen in ""Mad Max"" to sophisticated central Sydney through John Woo's lens in ""Mission: Impossible II."" Compared with, say, the United States, it's a relatively cheap place to film. By filming sci-fi blockbuster ""The Matrix"" in Sydney, the Wachowski Brothers were able to keep their budget down to $60 million. Making the same film in the United States would have cost three times as much, they say. And then there's the talent. Directors like Philip Noyce (""The Quiet American,"" ""Rabbit Proof Fence"") and Baz Luhrmann (""Strictly Ballroom,"" ""Moulin Rouge!"") and stars including Cate Blanchett and Nicole Kidman all hail from Down Under. Over the years, the Australian film industry has produced groundbreaking and remarkable movies like ""Shine,"" ""Muriel's Wedding"" and more recently ""Lantana"" that have burst out of the domestic movie market and made a splash internationally. But breakout successes like these are few and far between. Despite the industry producing quality films since the 70s, it has failed to build its accomplishments into a sustainable domestic film market. Some of the problem is down to size. Australia may be big but its population is tiny, coming in at a little over 21 million -- just twice the number of people living in the city of Sao Paolo, Brazil alone. This has meant limited government funding for the film industry and over the last five years, an average of just $20 million (AUS) ($19 million) has been raised each year from private investors. So for domestic flicks there just isn't much money to go around -- average budgets are between $4-8 million (AUS) ($3.8-7.6 million). Although there are exceptions, low budgets mean Aussie filmmakers have struggled to come up with the kind of slick productions that make it to international distribution. ""Boutique"" is the euphemistic phrase bandied around to describe the country's industry, but Brian Rosen, CEO of Film Finance Corporation Australia (FFC), the government-backed film funding body, is more frank: . ""I would term [it] a cottage industry in that it is very hand to mouth for most filmmakers. We are limited with the kind of stories we can tell,"" he told CNN over the phone from Sydney. For big budget money, Australia relies on attracting Hollywood movies by competing with the United States on price. In the early 2000s, huge productions like ""The Matrix"" trilogy (the first film to be shot at the Fox Studios complex outside Sydney) and the ""Star Wars"" prequels were filmed over a number of years. While this was positive for the industry in terms of creating work, it hasn't succeed in putting identifiably Australian movies with bigger budgets onto the world stage. More recently, big Hollywood bucks have dried up as the drop in value of the dollar has created incentives to stay at home. But in the last two years, there have been some fundamental changes in the backing for films that give cause for hope in the industry. One of Australia's most famous film exports, director Baz Luhrmann's latest film, ""Australia"" is at the heart of the changes. Starring two of Australia's best-known Hollywood diaspora -- Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman -- it is billed as a sweeping Outback action-adventure romance. It is the story of an English rose who inherits a cattle station and then has to enter into a pact with a stockman to prevent her property from being taken over. With an estimated budget of $130 million, it is the most expensive film in the country's history. And it is the first Australian epic. ""The importance of that film is enormous. It's the first blockbuster that's identifiably Australian,"" Ian Robertson, head of the media division of Sydney-based lawyers Holding Redlich told Variety. It's not just the size of the film or its subject matter. While preparing to shoot, the kitsch-loving filmmaker was instrumental in lobbying the Australian government to introduce a new incentive scheme that gives filmmakers a 40 percent rebate on the budget of their film. This effectively allows Fox, the Hollywood studio behind ""Australia,"" to take back over a third of the film's total budget. The government and film officials hope that this new offset could be the catalyst for a turnaround in the industry's fortunes, increasing the production value of Aussie films from around $600 million (AUS) ($576 million) a year to $1 billion (AUS) ($960 million) over the next few years. ""We've made 'Crocodile Dundee' and 'Mad Max' and in the 90s we did 'Muriel's Wedding' and 'Strictly Ballroom' ... we need to be doing more of that, so what we're hoping with the offset is that we can move back up to doing 30 or 40 films a year. When you're only making 20 films a year it's hard to have any success,"" Rosen explained to CNN. Foreign investment into Australian companies is being encouraged by testing productions for ""Australian-ness."" To be eligible for the full 40 percent rebate, productions must pass a check that covers the film's subject matter, where it was made and the nationalities of the producer and director amongst others. This way, the government hopes to start building the sustainable industry that has eluded them so far. Aussie digital production company Animal Logic, the brains behind the 2007 hit ""Happy Feet,"" is producing the latest film to benefit from the new rebate. Animated feature ""Guardians of Ga'Hoole,"" which is projected to come out in 2010, is based on the American series of children's books by Kathryn Lasky set in the imaginary ""Forest of Tyto."" The film's makers say the forest is being designed to look like Tasmania and the majority of the cast is expected to be made up of Australian actors. Despite the apparent Aussie credentials, this latest offset award is causing some controversy. Critics say the film shouldn't be eligible because it has been in production by U.S. studio Warner Bros. since 2005. Some Aussie filmmakers are wary of the rebate being abused by foreign filmmakers. If it becomes too popular it could attract negative attention from the new money-conscious government. Nevertheless, exporting Australian culture is important to many in the country's film industry. Australian actor Kick Gurry, who recently starred in the Wachowski Brothers' latest film, ""Speed Racer"" told CNN: ""If Australian [movies] can go well internationally and support artists at home it's really important to the cultural identity of a place."" The powers that be in Australian cinema certainly seem to be doing as much as they can to raise the industry's international profile and attract foreign filmmakers. This year, the annual Sydney Film Festival launched a brand new official film competition. New South Wales Minister Linda Burney was at Cannes Film Festival to make the announcement and told CNN: ""Part of the reason for this announcement is to make it more attractive for international producers, international films ... to say to the international film community, 'We want your business.' We are saying to the rest of the world, 'Come to Sydney, come to our state, make films and we will look after you.'"" Brian Rosen hopes that more money will mean films with broader international appeal. ""We need to be making more ambitious films. I think we will be doing films with broader audience appeal which will have a much bigger success. So I see more ""Happy Feet"" happening,"" he said. Aussiewood could be awakening from its slumber.","Australia has great locations, talent and is a relatively cheap place to make films .
Despite movies like ""Shine"" the domestic industry remains small and hand to mouth .
Recent changes in the backing for films could be the catalyst for a resurgence ."
"(CNN) -- Some players might not have wanted too much court time in their first match back after a layoff, but Novak Djokovic didn't appear to mind being pushed to the limits by Gael Monfils at the Rogers Cup in Toronto. The world No. 1, who was playing for the first time since winning Wimbledon last month, was taken all the way by the Frenchman in their second-round match before eventually prevailing 6-2 6-7 (7-4) 7-6 (7-2) in two hours 41 minutes. ""In a way it was fun, of course, and entertaining to be part of this match,"" Djokovic said, the ATP Tour official website reported. ""I enjoyed it. I tried to take the positives from this long match, and those are obviously the fact that I stayed over two and a half hours on the court and I have not played an official hard-court match since the Miami final. ""That helps obviously to play a little bit more, to feel the court, to feel the conditions."" Djokovic has now won all 10 of his meetings with Monfils and will face another Frenchman, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the third round. Tsonga will be the fresher of the two after seeing off his countryman Jeremy Chardy 7-6(8/6) 6-4 in one hour and 37 minutes. Djokovic has a 13-5 head-to-head record against Tsonga and has won their last nine meetings, most recently in the fourth round at Wimbledon. But he is still wary of the threat posed by the 13th seed. ""My next opponent has a very similar game, power game like Gael's,"" Djokovic said. ""I'm not feeling tired, I'm not exhausted, I haven't played a tournament for four weeks. I of course look forward to compete more."" Djokovic was joined in the third round by two-time Rogers Cup winner Andy Murray, who crushed Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios 6-2 6-2 in less than an hour to set up a clash with France's Richard Gasquet. Wimbledon semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov was taken to three sets by American Donald Young before progressing to a clash with Spanish 17th seed Tommy Robredo. Last year's losing finalist Milos Raonic kept home hopes alive by overcoming young American Jack Sock 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (7-4) after two hours and 24 minutes. Canada's world No. 6, who won his sixth ATP Tour title in Washington last weekend, will next play French veteran Julien Benneteau. Fourth seed Tomas Berdych and No. 5 David Ferrer also went through, while Marin Cilic set up a meeting with Wimbledon finalist Roger Federer -- who is seeking to add to his 2004 and 2006 Rogers Cup titles. Serena eases into third round . Meanwhile in Montreal, world No. 1 Serena Williams was in ominous form in her second-round Rogers Cup match against Sam Stosur. The defending champion blew away the Australian in straight sets 6-0 6-2 in just under an hour to set up a meeting with Czech Lucie Safarova, who overcame Magdalena Rybarikova 6-4, 6-2. ""It feels great to be here,"" Williams said, speaking in French, the WTA's official website reported. ""I thought I played well tonight. She's won a Grand Slam title and she's a really good player, so it was important for me to play well. ""I love it here and I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight."" Serena's sister Venus is also safely through to the next round after beating Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan 6-3 6-2. She will next play Angelique Kerber, who was beaten by Serena in the Stanford final on Sunday. Fourth seed Maria Sharapova went through to round three despite losing the first set against 27th-ranked Garbine Muguruza, and the Russian will next play another SPaniard in Carla Suarez-Navarro. Second seed and 2012 Rogers Cup winner Petra Kvitova also progressed with a 6-3 6-2 win over Casey Dellacqua, and the two-time Wimbledon champion next plays Russia's Ekaterina Makarova. But No. 9 seed Ana Ivanovic is out after losing 6-7 (9-7) 7-6 (9-7) 6-4 to America's Coco Vandeweghe, who earned a clash with another Serbian, former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic. Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova was also knocked out, going down in three sets 2-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (5-7) to Britain's Heather Watson, who will now play two-time grand slam winner Victoria Azarenka.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods suffered a fresh injury setback Sunday after he was forced to pull out of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio, midway through the final round. Woods appeared to jar his back playing an awkward shot out of the bunker on the second hole. Evidently in some pain, Woods' round deteriorated as he found both a pond and the trees before eventually deciding he couldn't continue six holes later. By then he was four shots over par for the tournament. He was later seen struggling to get his shoes off, calling into question whether he will be fit for next week's PGA Championship and the up and coming Ryder Cup. ""I just jarred it, and it's been spasming ever since,"" he told the PGA's official website. ""It's just the whole lower back."" Woods had only just recently returned to competitive action after taking three months out to have microdiscetomy surgery. The WGC-Bridgestone Invitational was his third tournament since the procedure, which was needed after Woods had struggled with the pain for close to two years. ""I don't know,"" Woods replied when asked whether he would be fit for the PGA Championship.

"(CNN) -- After the highs of 2013, it hasn't been a great year for Serena Williams. However, the American tennis star says she is ""on the right track"" after getting back to winning ways at Stanford on Sunday. She won the Bank of the West Classic tournament for the third time, fighting back from a horror start to defeat German world No. 7 Angelique Kerber 7-6 (7-1) 6-3 in the final in California. It not only gave Williams a WTA Tour-leading fourth title this season, but helped her become just the fifth player to be ranked No. 1 for 200 weeks or more since the women's standings began in 1975. Having failed to make it past the first week at Wimbledon and the French Open, and losing in the last 16 at the season's opening grand slam in Melbourne, the 32-year-old is now seeking to resurrect her season by retaining her U.S. Open title next month. ""It would definitely make it better, but it wouldn't make it go away,"" she said when asked if success in New York would make up for her disappointing year so far. ""I feel like I'm on the right track again. I feel like I can play even better -- I wasn't serving my best, and I wasn't making as many winners off the return as I wanted to, but I think I'm getting there."" Stanford was her first tournament since a bizarre performance during a doubles match at Wimbledon, which she later explained as being due to a viral illness. Williams, who started her sixth spell at No. 1 in February 2013, trailed 5-1 in the opening set against Kerber, who she had beaten in all but one of their previous five meetings. ""I was just thinking I had to take it one point at a time,"" Williams said. ""I knew I just had to relax and not be so crazy. ""Up until that point I wasn't doing what I wanted to do, and what I had been doing in practice, so I knew I just had to start doing the right things going forward."" Williams now has 61 career titles, 39 behind third-ranked Steffi Graf on the all-time list. However, she is only five grand slams behind the German's record of 22 and Graf said she wouldn't bet against Williams closing on that milestone. ""While I don't have a crystal ball, living in Las Vegas I've come to appreciate odds,"" the 45-year-old told the WTA Tour website when asked about Williams' chances of extending her tally. ""My answer would be yes."" Graf holds the record of 377 weeks at No. 1 -- more than any player, male or female -- and paid tribute to Williams' achievement in passing the 200 mark. ""Being at your best all the time in a year-round sport is all-consuming,"" Graf said. ""Add to it being the best as you set the bar makes it more exhausting -- physically, mentally and emotionally. ""Keeping that up for almost four years is remarkable."" The tour now heads to Canada for the Rogers Cup in Montreal, where defending champion Williams faces a potential quarterfinal against rising star Eugenie Bouchard. Kerber is in the same quarter of the draw as Maria Sharapova, who she beat at Wimbledon, while the strong field also includes that tournament's champion Petra Kvitova and former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka.","Serena Williams wins her 61st career title in California on Sunday .

"(BudgetTravel) -- Street food is suddenly hip, but in New York it's as old as salt on pretzels. So we asked a Big Apple vendor for dirt on -- well, how dirty are those carts, anyway?

Yeah, I know I could serve it the next day -- and that might save me $10 -- but my customers would taste the difference.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It may lack the prestige of Cannes, but this year's Sydney Film Festival was an equally glitzy and glamorous affair, attracting some Hollywood heavyweights. Darlene Johnson is a rising star among the new wave of Aboriginal filmmakers currently being feted in the country. In its 55th year, the 10th oldest film festival in the world, showcased an array of Antipodean and global talent. But one group that has been woefully ignored by Australian cinema are its indigenous people or Aborigines as they are more commonly known. The indigenous cultures of Australia are said to be some of the oldest in the world -- going back at least 65,000 years, it is argued. However, throughout the country's history, Aborigines have been marginalized and discriminated against in Australia. In films, Aboriginal people were often portrayed as the threatening, primitive ""other,"" in need of civilization by the white settlers. Examples of this treatment can be found going back to the early 20th century, in the 1936 film ""Uncivilized"" and the 1950 film ""Bitter Springs."" Widely recognized as natural story tellers, with a long history of oral tradition, passed down through generations, indigenous people have fought to develop a distinctive voice and have a determining role in how they are represented in Australia. One of the earliest instances of filmmaking by an indigenous director was the 1979 film, ""My Survival as an Aborigine,"" by civil rights campaigner Essie Coffey. However, it was not until the early 1990s that the government made a commitment to encourage and nurture Aboriginal filmmakers with the foundation of the indigenous branch of the Australian Film Commission (AFC). Over the past ten years, the unit has discovered and nurtured a range of award-winning talents, like Tracey Moffat and Ivan Sen. Australia now has a growing number of outstanding indigenous actors and directors and there is a growing buzz around several films being developed by these filmmakers. Writer-director Richard Frankland, who recently finished a road trip comedy titled ""To Hell and Back,"" says he wants to do for Australian film ""what Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor did in the 70s and 80s [for black people in U.S. films]"" The interest in Aboriginal films has reached fever pitch with established white directors like Philip Noyce and Rolf de Heer also making films with indigenous themes. Noyce's powerful 2002 film ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" was based on the true story of the ""Stolen Generation"" of Aboriginal children, who were forcibly removed from their families and placed with white foster parents. While de Heer's successful 2006 film ""Ten Canoes"" was the first ever to be filmed entirely in one of Australia's indigenous languages. It was screened at the Cannes film festival, where de Heer received a special jury prize. Among the rising indigenous stars of the future is award winning director Darlene Johnson who is from the Dunghutti tribe. Johnson's documentary ""Stolen Generations"", was nominated for an International Emmy in 2000. She is currently working on her first feature film, ""Obelia"", which will be produced by Phillip Noyce. She told CNN her work is primarily driven by a passion to give a voice to her people. ""I have a love and a passion to tell indigenous stories on the screen. I basically want to see more black people on the screen and some of their stories represented."" ""We are very fortunate in Australia that we have funding from the government and the AFC, they have been instrumental in supporting indigenous filmmakers and developing their careers,"" she told The Screening Room. Her touching film ""River of No Return"" follows indigenous actress and star of ""Ten Canoes,"" Frances Djulibing as she strives to achieve her dream of becoming a movie star like her idol Marilyn Monroe. Watch an extract from River of No Return . Frances, a 42-year-old mother of three from the remote community of Ramingining in North East Arnhem Land, approached Johnson to make the documentary. ""Frances had an identification with Marilyn Monroe and skin color didn't seem to be an issue or a barrier, Johnson tells CNN. ""She wanted to look beautiful and be sexy and become a movie star, and I thought you can't get further away from Aboriginal culture than Marilyn Monroe and that got me into her story."" With several AFC funded projects, like ""Samson and Delilah"" in the pipeline and indigenous film festivals around the country, the current enthusiasm for indigenous filmmaking seems to know no bounds. One reason for this can, perhaps, be attributed to the fact that Australia seems to be in a state of flux. Under a new leadership, the country appears to be in a contrite mood of reconciliation -- not dissimilar to South Africa's post-apartheid years -- and is acknowledging past mistakes. In February, new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd issued an historic apology to Aboriginal people for ""the indignity and degradation inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture,"" over two centuries of white settlement. Arts Minister Peter Garrett is also a part of this new wave of politicians determined to reverse the divisive policies of previous decades. In his former incarnation as lead singer of Aussie rock band ""Midnight Oil,"" Garrett played an instrumental role in bringing global attention to the plight of indigenous Australians. The band's performance of their famous hit ""Beds are Burning"" at the 2000 Olympic Games was notable for their decision to wear tracksuits emblazoned with the words ""SORRY"". Garrett told CNN's The Screening Room, he is confident that indigenous filmmakers have a big future in Australian cinema. ""One thing that we do know is that the indigenous culture is incredibly important to Australians,"" he said. ""These people have been in this land for a very long period of time and they have many powerful stories to tell. ""And we are starting to see a generation of young film-makers coming through and they will be provided with particular support and opportunities to begin their craft by making short films and as they become more experienced, go on to make bigger movies as well. ""I confidently predict that we will see some absolutely outstanding films produced by our indigenous filmmakers in the coming years."" However, for all the buzz and optimism currently surrounding indigenous filmmakers, Johnson is keen to emphasize that life is still incredibly hard for Aborigines, especially those who live in remote parts of the country. ""One of the things I wanted to illustrate in the documentary was to show how hard it is in indigenous communities in remote Australia,"" she says. In her film, we see Frances struggle to readjust to her life in Ramingining after the glamour of traveling to cosmopolitan locations like Cannes with ""Ten Canoes"" and the profound difficulty she faces in applying for a performing arts course. It takes seven weeks and a 6 km trek into town just to get her application in. Frances also faces resentment from her neighbors who perceive her as becoming more like balanda (white) because she has traveled out of her community. ""If you want to do something with your life, like acting, it is much harder than most people realize. It doesn't matter if you have contacts like Rolf de Heer and Phillip Noyce like Frances has,"" Johnson added. ""I wanted to raise some questions about the cultural gap between traditional communities and white culture. ""I hope it brings some insight into the entrenched cultural and social problems that exist in these remote places.""","Aborigines have fought to develop a distinctive voice and tell their own story .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Sir Run Run Shaw, the media tycoon who helped bring Chinese martial arts films to an international audience, died at his home in Hong Kong on Tuesday at the age of 106, the television station he founded said on Tuesday. Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) said in a statement that the centenarian would be sadly missed: . ""Although we knew this day will come, no words can adequately express our sorrow and lessen our sense of a profound loss,"" it said. With his elder brother, Runme, Shaw co-founded one of the world's largest film studios, Shaw Brothers. The company has produced around 1,000 movies since 1958, and helped launch the careers of star actors and directors from across Asia. At its peak, in the 1960s and 1970s, the studios were making more than 40 films a year, according to a biography by film history writers Zhan Youpeng and Lan Chao. ""The Shaw brothers -- they created the martial arts action genre and made it huge. And it's been copied ever since,"" said Patrick Frater, Asia bureau chief at industry publication Variety. Shaw also has credits on several U.S. films, including Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner."" He was born in 1907 in the city of Ningbo, near Shanghai in China, although there is some confusion about his exact date of birth, Frater said. He was the youngest of six children fathered by a successful textile merchant. In the 1920s, he joined his brother Runje in Singapore in an effort to establish a market for Chinese-language films in Southeast Asia, according to a Hong Kong Film Archive chronology. By 1939, they had opened 139 cinemas across the region. ""Run Run Shaw was there at the beginning of the century when cinema first took off,"" Frater said. After World War II, Shaw moved to Hong Kong and began concentrating on film production, opening a world-class studio called Movie Town in 1961. Six years later, he co-founded Hong Kong's first free-to-air station, TVB. The network remains one of the world's most influential Chinese-language broadcasters. Shaw was a generous philanthropist, especially in the education sector. The Shaw Prize, an international science award that he established, has become known as the ""Nobel of the East."" The media mogul was knighted by the Queen in 1977. Shaw received Hong Kong's highest honor award, the Grand Bauhinia Medal, in 1998, after the territory returned to Chinese rule. He remained involved in Hong Kong's media industry well into his later years, retiring as chairman of the television station, TVB, only in 2011 at the age of 104. Shaw is survived by his wife, Mona Fong, and four children. People we lost in 2014 . CNN's Katie Hunt contributed to this report.","Hong Kong media mogul Run Run Shaw has died at age 106 .

"(CNN) -- If the Day of Judgment begins Saturday, as an apocalyptic Christian radio network has predicted, the community of Rapture, Indiana, will likely take it in stride. Perhaps that's because the souls who lived in 15 to 20 homes in the southwest corner of the state are long gone -- leaving only one family and the name Rapture on online maps. Curious about its history, CNN called area post offices, the town hall in nearby Poseyville and the local library. Nobody had heard of Rapture, much less knew how it got its name. But they did know of Bugtown, as the tiny community on Highway 68 is now known. Heather Gallagher, director of Poseyville Carnegie Public Library, did a little digging and suggested a call to Bugtown's sole resident, who splits his time between Indiana and Nashville. David Tanner gave up his law practice and moved to Nashville, where he plays upright bass and sings in groups Spaghetti Westerneers and Brazilbilly. He owns a home, rental property and an airplane hangar in Bugtown. ""The rest is grass,"" said Tanner. An atheist, Tanner is not fretting about Family Radio founder Harold Camping's prediction that Jesus Christ will return during the world's destruction and ascend into heaven with true believers. I'm not concerned if the world doesn't end and it's all a hoax,"" Tanner said from Nashville Friday. ""If it does (end), I've had a great time living to 46."" In nearby Griffin, Guy Carner, 77, said he is familiar with Bugtown. ""It's a dot in the road."" He, too, was philosophical about Saturday's predicted Rapture. ""I think the Bible says you never know when it will happen."" Tanner, whose Indiana home is 150 years old, said old-timers at some point began referring to Rapture as Bugtown. ""We'll never know exactly where the name came from,"" he said of Rapture. He does have a idea on why the area is called Bugtown. ""She said there was a lot of bugs,"" the musician said, quoting his grandmother. For several years, Tanner has held the Bugtown Jamboree the Sunday before Labor Day. Bluegrass and other musicians play. The event has included a square dance, two parachutists and a helicopter. All for a $10 donation. Tanner's not sure if he'll pull it together this year. ""It's a lot of beer bottles to pick up."" Saturday, meanwhile, should be pretty quiet in the Indiana farm country, with highs in the low 80s, but scattered thunderstorms in Poseyville are possible. The Poseyville library is planning to open at 9 a.m. Come rain or Rapture, postal carriers will deliver mail, said Postmaster Cecilia Luebke in nearby New Harmony. ""Absolutely,"" she said.","Rapture, Indiana, is in farm country a half-hour northwest of Evansville .

"(CNN) -- Arcade game-inspired fashionistas mixing with heavy metal bands grinding out tunes on street corners sounds like a scene you might find in New York's trendier locales. But this is South Africa -- a country with a young population and a thriving underground youth culture. Last year, Swedish filmmakers Teddy Goitom and Benjamin Taft traveled to Cape Town and Johannesburg in search of a different scene, one which steered clear of the ""media stereotypes of violence, AIDS and safaris."" The result is ""Stocktown X: South Africa,"" an uplifting and colorful 30-minute documentary which gives a snapshot of the exciting youth scene in some of Cape Town and Johannesburg's poorest districts. Here, you'll find artists and designers, musicians and photographers, all making their mark on the community and beyond, fashioning an identity for themselves through the things they create, says Goitom. ""I hope this film is an eye-opener to the stuff happening here, despite media reports of what is going on,"" Goitom said. He and Taft meet heavy-metal band Ree-Burth who play sessions to small, but highly appreciative crowds from a backyard in Pimville, Soweto, and Gazelle, an electro-pop band from Cape Town. Next, they drop in on the creators of fashion brand 2Bop, which designs street-wear inspired by 1980s arcade games such as Nintendo's ""Street Fighter,"" before catching up with Kepi Mngomezulu, founder of the Soweto-based ""Smarteez"" fashion collective. ""Our styles vary from person to person depending on how we absorb what inspires us. So we have different fashion icons, but the style definitely has a common thread giving an overall Smarteez aesthetic,"" Mngomezulu said. He says the street culture vibe is ""very unpredictable and evolving rapidly"" because people are realizing how self-expression can be used ""as a weapon to shoot your voice for the world to hear."" Smarteez, and other street culture movements, are giving voice to a new generation, Mngomezulu said. ""Day by day the youth of South Africa -- irrespective of their backgrounds and cultural differences -- are starting to take awareness in what's happening in the world,"" he said. ""They are starting to take a stand by voicing their opinions literally, or by other means of expression."" Goitom agrees, saying that the people he met while filming were incredibly well-informed about the wider social and political world. Stocktown X: South Africa is the latest in a series of documentaries in which Goitom and Taft have explored underground urban music scenes in Japan, Australia and Brazil and the United States. He hopes this latest film, which last week premiered at the CinemAfrica film festival in Sweden will, in some small way, encourage young people outside Africa to look in on the continent's growing pool of creative talent.","New documentary showcases the sights and sounds of South Africa's youth scene .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- An alleged drug kingpin was captured in his underwear Monday, hiding in a bush outside a house in western Colombia, government officials said in Bogota. Diego Leon Montoya Sanchez was captured in his underwear, hiding in bushes, Gen. Mario Montoya Uribe said. Diego Leon Montoya Sanchez, now 47 the FBI says, was taken into custody early Monday, Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos told reporters. ""He was considered the most sought-after narcotrafficker in the world,"" Santos said. The FBI had been seeking Montoya, known as ""Don Diego,"" for seven years and had him on the Most Wanted list. The FBI accused him of being responsible for shipping ""multiple tons of cocaine"" into the United States and called him ""one of the principal leaders of the Colombian North Valley drug cartel,"" which it said is ""the most powerful and violent drug trafficking organization in Colombia."" The cartel reportedly relies on right-wing paramilitary and left-wing rebel groups, the FBI said on its Web site, which had not been updated Monday evening. Montoya was responsible for as much as 70 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States and Europe and his organization ordered 1,500 assassinations, Santos said.  Watch Montoya being escorted under heavy guard » . The capture was the culmination of a plan months in the making, Santos said. Plans revved up three days ago, when informants told authorities that Montoya was in the town of Salsa in the department of El Valle, he said. On Sunday, intelligence narrowed his whereabouts to the Hacienda Pital, said Gen. Mario Montoya Uribe. ""With this information, we mounted the operation,"" he said. ""This morning, at 4:30 a.m., we got the green light."" Forty members of the army's special forces were flown past Montoya Sanchez's phalanx of security guards, and other soldiers were moved to other locations to distract them, he said. By 6:20 a.m. a commando team had surrounded the house as other troops stayed about 400 meters away. Inside they found three women, including Montoya Sanchez's mother, and two men, one of them his uncle. They also found his wallet and cell phone, but Montoya Sanchez was nowhere to be found, the general said. But a soldier searching outside the house saw leaves of a bush move and found the suspect hiding, clad in his underwear, Montoya Uribe said. The heavy-set man was taken to a helicopter and ferried to the capital, where authorities paraded him -- now wearing a black T-shirt and khaki pants, his hands bound before him -- before reporters. Asked if he wanted to make a statement, he said he did not. Montoya Sanchez's two brothers are also in custody on drug charges. Juan Carlos has been extradited to the United States and Eugenio is awaiting extradition. The U.S. State Department was offering a $5 million reward for Montoya Sanchez's capture. It was not immediately clear who, if anyone, would get it. Since taking office in 2002, President Alvaro Uribe, a key U.S. ally in Latin America, has approved the extradition of nearly 500 Colombians to the United States, the majority on drug-trafficking charges, according to The Associated Press. For his aggressive stance, the United States has awarded Colombia with more than $700 million in annual anti-narcotic aid.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona marked Pep Guardiola's final match in charge with a 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao to win the Copa del Rey Friday. It was the 14th trophy of Guardiola's remarkable reign at the Catalan giants which began at the start of the 2008/09 season when he succeeded Frank Rijkaard. To honor their departing coach, Barcelona turned on the style in the Vicente Calderon Stadium in Madrid and the match was effectively over inside the first 25 minutes as Pedro Rodriguez with a double and Lionel Messi scored to put them 3-0 ahead. The emphatic victory will be consolation in part for shattering defeats to eventual winners Chelsea in the semifinal of the Champions League and the concession of their La Liga title to arch-rivals Real Madrid. After the Chelsea reverse, the 41-year-old Guardiola announced he would be leaving at the end of the season, bringing to a close a 23-year association with the club as a player and coach. Guardiola cited tiredness and the need to take a break as reasons for his departure, but he has been linked with a number of vacant managerial vacancies, including Chelsea. His assistant Tito Vilanova will take charge of Barcelona next season. They shared the dugout for the final time as Barcelona rounded off their season and afterwards Guardiola said he left with a special sense of accomplishment. ""Fourteen titles in four years is a very high standard so I am very happy to leave the club in a good position, and tonight we played great for the first 35 minutes, we've had a good year with four titles so I leave very satisfied,"" he told gathered reporters. ""From (Lionel) Messi I have learned to be even more competitive than I ever was, without him we would not have won the number of titles we have and I'm very privileged to have coached who for me is the best player I have ever seen."" Barca's 2011/12 campaign had begun in the usual all-conquering fashion for Guardiola and his men as they collected the Spanish Super Cup, beating Real Madrid, the European Super Cup and their second Club World Cup. But Real took advantage of rare slips by the three-time reigning champions to forge clear in La Liga, the title sealed by a 2-1 win at the Nou Camp last month. A 2-2 home draw to Chelsea, losing 3-2 on aggregate, prompted Guardiola's shock departure and left the Copa del Rey as their only remaining target. Marcelo Bielsa's Bilbao were expected to offer stiffer resistance but defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Europa League final and disappointing late season form in La Liga was reflected in their performance. Pedro, who has endured a mediocre season, thumped home the first after three minutes and Messi made it 2-0 with his 73rd goal of the season for Barcelona soon afterwards. Pedro's low strike on 25 minutes settled all doubt about the eventual outcome although Fernando Llorente looked to have a strong penalty claim when pulled down by Gerard Pique. Bilbao had the better chances after the break but Barcelona's stars coasted to their third victory in Spain's domestic cup competition in four years to provide a fitting finale for Guardiola.

"(CNN) -- It's being presented as the future of cinema and a movie-going revolution. Specs appeal: 3D is on its way to being free of 3D glasses as the format is rapidly advancing. While literally adding a new dimension to cinema-goers' experience, 3D is also being touted as a means to help filmmakers reach new creative heights, make millions of dollars for Hollywood studios and curb the scourge of the industry -- piracy. Dreamworks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has likened the new 3D to the first sound and color in movies. Director James Cameron's $200 million-plus sci-fi epic ""Avatar"" is an expected genre-killer. The prestigious Cannes Film Festival this year opened with a 3D screening of Pixar's ""Up"". But even as Hollywood studios and producers embrace digital 3D, they admit they are still learning how to use it. ""We've really gone past the point of seeing the technology as a barrier,"" Phil 'Captain 3D' McNally told CNN. McNally heads Dreamworks' drive to produce all its animated features in 3D after this year's blockbuster ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" ""The challenge now is 100 years of experience in how to make movies in 2D,"" said McNally, speaking of a movie industry that has spent its existence flattening the 3D of real life for the silver screen. ""As filmmakers, we have very little experience in thinking spatially, unlike a sculptor,"" he said. ""There's going to be great filmmakers that are going to deliver experiences like you've never seen before,"" said Jason Clark, a motion picture producer who helped launch Dreamworks' 3D foray and worked on ""Monster House"" and ""Stuart Little,"" the first time a photorealistic character was spliced into a live action movie. But ""the storytelling is always king,"" Clark told CNN. ""You can use these techniques to create a unique experience that makes that story impact on a more personal level with the audience. But it should never take away from the experience or lead the storytelling."" Creative boom or creative killer? Filmmakers are greeting 3D with cautious excitement. ""2D is completely a mistake,"" said Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the Academy Award-nominated director of Babel, at a recent press conference in Seoul, South Korea. ""It's like when they criticized me because I use handheld, they said 'you're very gimmicky',"" the director said of his preferred camera style. ""The way I experience life is handheld. 3D is the way we experience life."" But, Inarritu noted, there was a risk that the technology could distract from the story's emotional catharsis, something that other creatives have also voiced concerns about. ""[3D] doesn't guarantee a success or a good movie or a good movie experience,"" said Syd Field, widely appreciated as a screenwriting guru. He noted that the talking pictures had their growing pains in the 1920's; Hollywood imported playwrights to craft dialogue but filmmakers paid more attention to cameras and sound recorders. ""As we learned to use the technology, then it began to become an art form,"" Field told CNN. ""3D right now is at its infant stages."" The rise of digital cinema has given 3D its legs. Gone are the days of struggling to synch two separate projectors to create a 3D effect that would sometimes come with nausea or headaches. The iconic kitsch of the red and blue-lense cardboard glasses has been replaced by sleeker polarized aviator models. The future is 3D without glasses, delivered through autostereoscopic displays. Digital projection is ""rock steady"" and could define how different generations take on 3D, said Clark. ""The way you interpret 3D images is that your brain looks at each separate image, the left and right image, and it stitches them together,"" Clark said, likening it to adults using muscles they don't normally use. ""But kids, it's all new to them, and they haven't had the painful experience of watching misaligned 3D in the 1970's, the 1980's, and the 1990's. So I think the experience for them is a lot easier to interpret."" It's no coincidence that animation is leading 3D releases, along with horror, Clark said, as the children who watched 2004's ""Polar Express"" are growing up. ""Now you're going to have to deliver them different kinds of content. So your audience is growing."" Eyes on the prize . For theatre owners, studios and distributors, 3D appears a healthy cash cow, with higher-priced tickets helping titles gross up to three times as much as their 2D counterparts. The United States will have around 3,000 3D screens by the end of this year when ""Avatar"" is scheduled for release, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO). About 90 to 100 screens are being added every month, though theatre operators are pausing in a tight credit market. ""Movie theatre owners are highly conscious of the expense involved in installing a 3D system,"" said Patrick Corcoran, Director of Media & Research at NATO, noting that out of approximately 600 theatrical releases this year, only 12 to 15 will be offered in 3D. ""No one knows right now how big the market will be,"" Corcoran told CNN. The studios are looking for scale. About ""5,000 screens in 2,000 to 3,000 locations"" is the tipping point that would allow an exclusively 3-D release, said McNally. ""That point should be reached within one or two years."" Filling those theatres will be people who don't want to watch bootleg versions, Hollywood hopes, as 3D comes with a promise that it's hard to pirate. ""If you are really determined, you can make a copy of anything,"" said McNally, suggesting that 3-D movies could be recorded through the same kind of lenses used in 3-D glasses, but pirates would have to be ""pretty serious"" to pull it off. The real deterrent appears to be the widening gap between home and theatre. Leaked DVD quality movies are being downloaded on better broadband Internet and played on surround-sound home entertainment systems. 3D promises to deliver a unique experience in theatres that could allow Hollywood to take something back. Studios and theatre owners insist there's no real comparison. ""Comedies are funnier when everybody's laughing. Movies are scarier when everybody's frightened. And that's something that can't be replicated in the home,"" Corcoran said. ""It comes down to the kind of enjoyment you want from your movie experience,"" McNally said, likening the choice to visiting the Grand Canyon or seeing a photograph, that ""doesn't capture the sense of the place, the space, how you felt when you were there.""","Digital tech impetus behind 3D films; studios still working out how best to use .

"(CNN) -- Dagestan has hit the headlines, but this obscure, impoverished southern Russian republic on the coast of the Caspian Sea won't be familiar even to those who pride themselves on being news nerds. Were it not for the fact that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the two brothers implicated in the deadly Boston Marathon bombing, lived briefly in Dagestan before coming to the United States, and had Tamerlan, the elder sibling, not visited there last year, most Americans would have been blissfully ignorant about this patch of the planet. But Dagestan has a special resonance to the people of the North Caucasus, especially to Muslims, the largest religious group in the republic. The legendary Imam Shamil, who led the war against the Russian Tsar's armies between 1834-1859 as they sought to conquer the area, belonged to Dagestan's Avar ethnic group. LATEST: Boston suspect says brother was mastermind . More recently, the August 1999 incursion into Dagestan by militants based in neighboring Chechnya was among the triggers of contemporary Russia's second war there. Russian military installations in Dagestan were attacked in 1996, 1999, and 2002. The Russian authorities linked the 2010 suicide bombings of the Moscow Metro to a Dagestani militant leader, and the two female suicide bombers hailed from Dagestan. Yet none of this explains why Dagestan is suddenly so prominent in international news headlines. What has made this little known place famous now is its connection to the Tsarnaevs, ethnic Chechens raised in the Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan -- particularly elder brother Tamerlan, who spent time in the poor Russian republic in early 2012. His recent turn to Islam and interest in radical Islamist websites has now raised question about what, if anything, connects the Boston bombings to distant Dagestan. Dagestan is one of seven small republics within the Russian Federation that together comprise Russia's North Caucasus region, a predominantly Muslim area which itself is wedged between the Caspian and Black Seas. Dagestan adjoins Chechnya, lies at the eastern extremity of the Caucasus mountain range, and the Dagestani capital, Makhachkala, sits on the Caspian coast. Smaller than West Virginia and with under 3 million people, Dagestan is an ethno-linguistic kaleidoscope of some 30 nationalities, among the largest being the Avars, Dargins, Kumyks, and Lezgins. Aside from the poverty of most of its inhabitants, several features mark Dagestan's recent history, few of them positive. Though Chechnya, in late 1991, was the first North Caucasus republic to try to secede from Russia, an anti-Russian insurgency now covers the entire North Caucasus. It has metamorphosed from a primarily nationalist, secular revolt into one driven by militant Islamists, whose goal is not just freedom from Russia but the creation of a sharia-governed ""emirate"" encompassing the entire region. Chechnya, ruled by the brutal, Russia-backed strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, is now relatively quiet, and its Islamist insurgents, while still active, are on the defensive. But Dagestan has gone in the opposite direction and is gripped by instability and violence. Radical Islamist groups tied to the war against the Russian state now have much deeper roots, and are far more active, in Dagestan than in Chechnya. Drive-by shootings, kidnappings, bombings, and slayings of local politicians and law enforcement personnel are commonplace. Much of this upheaval can be traced back to militant Islamist groups, but it also stems from organized crime and turf battles, often waged along ethnic lines, to control sectors of the Dagestani economy and smuggling routes. Corruption is pervasive, as is the brutality of the security services. Life in Dagestan, in a few words, can be chaotic and violent, and if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time, short. As for poverty, very few Dagestanis can escape it. TIMELINE: A look at Tamerlan Tsarnaev's past . This, then, is the setting Tamerlan Tsarnaev visited recently and where he spent a short time as a teenager. But it's unlikely that Dagestan is where he acquired the worldview that allegedly turned him into a terrorist or where he allegedly received the training to build the bombs that killed and maimed Bostonians. It's clear by now that Tamerlan felt estranged from American society and had become a devout Muslim before he returned to Dagestan. Indeed, he felt happy hearing the calls to prayer from Makhachkala's mosques because Islam had already become integral to his identity and outlook. Unfortunately, he seems to have been animated by variants of Islam espoused by extremists, not the Sufi Islam of the North Caucasus. Did Tamerlan associate with militant groups during his Dagestani sojourn? We don't know yet. But it's unlikely that he would have received sustained training from professional terrorists while he was there. The bombs allegedly made by the Tsarnaev brothers, while deadly, were primitive. The duo made no attempt to disguise themselves: Dzhokhar's friends reportedly spotted him in crime photos in which he wore his trademark baseball cap turned backward. The bombers killed an MIT police officer and carjacked a Mercedes SUV, not exactly an inconspicuous vehicle, while a massive manhunt for them was underway. Murderous as the plot the brothers allegedly designed was, professional it was notâ€”and that's fortunate. Many more people would have perished had Boston been targeted by a well-established international terrorist group connected to Al-Qaeda. There certainly is a violent Islamic insurgency underway in Dagestan and much of the rest of the North Caucasus, but the militants' main adversaries lie within Russia. America is peripheral to their pursuits. Dagestan has its fair share of problems, but the answers to why the Tsarnaevs may have turned to terrorism will likely have much less to do with the republic than the changes they, especially Tamerlan, underwent in America. The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of Rajan Menon.","Suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev visited Dagestan last year .

"(Wired) -- In theory, Origami is simple: Take a sheet of paper, follow the dotted lines and without the use of scissors or glue, you've got a paper crane. It stands to reason that if you're good at following instructions, you're good at origami. And that's trueâ€”anyone can fold their way to a simple paper crane. But truly grasping the geometric complexities of that crane? That's actually pretty brainy stuff. Nerdy Thanksgiving . Origami is arguably more math than art, so it makes sense then that MIT would have a thriving origami scene. Every Sunday, a group of around 20 to 30 people gather on campus to experiment with paper folding techniques. Most recently, the group folded a series of turkeys, cornucopias, pine cones and vegetables to create a gorgeously nerdy Thanksgiving tableau. Read more: Wildly detailed drawings that combine math and butterflies . If you're not a math person, it might seem incomprehensible to fashion a turkey out of a single piece of paper, but for Yongquan Lu and his fellow OrigaMIT members, it's an entertaining challenge. Lu, a sophomore mathematics major at MIT, is the incoming president of of OrigaMIT, and has been practicing paper folding since high school. ""I really love how systematic origami is,"" he says. ""It's the perfect combination of math and art."" The math behind the art . Every origami model you see relies on a blueprintâ€”a series of pre-determined creases that will guide the folder through the process. In the beginning, precise, careful folding can get you pretty far, but if you want to start riffing on designs or creating your own, you have to have more than an elementary grasp on some basic mathematical principles. ""I got more involved in investigating the connections between math and geometry behind it,"" he says. ""These days a lot of the stuff I fold is a lot more geometric, more tessellations."" For the Thanksgiving scene, Lu contributed the cornucopia basket, which he nonchalantly describes as a ""pretty well-known conical, flat tessellation pattern."" Read more: Mind-blowing portraits made of test tubes and pushpins . Most of the students at MIT approach paper folding with a highly-technical slant. It's not uncommon for the group to have a lengthy discussion about reverse-engineering each of the diagram's folds or talk about polyhedral shapes and hexagonal symmetry. ""We'll ask ourselves, 'Ok, where does this step come from, why does a designer choose to do it like this? Or I wonder if I started with these proportions, what would happen?"" Lu explains. ""That really comes out of the engineering background of a lot of our members."" No need for whizz skills . Lu is quick to clarify that though OrigaMIT probably tends to be slightly more math-centric than your typical origami club, you don't need to possess A Beautiful Mind-caliber math skills to join in. Sure, the peacock-like turkey took more than three hours to fold, but if you look around, there are tons of simple yet beautiful contributions like the vegetables, leaves and pine cones. ""We wanted to show that there are models of varying complexities. Sometimes people get intimidated because they think we're folding all of these complex models,"" he says. ""But actually everyone can get involvedâ€”it's not something that's exclusive and insular in any way."" Read more from WIRED: . Powerful Photos Go Deep Inside America's Fracking Boom .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian comedy promoter Maha Hosny is driving through the traffic-clogged streets of Cairo while talking to CNN on her cell phone, when there's a terrifying screech of tires and the line goes dead. Thankfully, she's unscathed, and within minutes is once again talking about her pioneering work bringing stand-up comedy to new Egyptian audiences -- and what tickles her funny bone. ""Just going through the streets of Cairo makes me laugh. The traffic here makes me laugh until dying,"" she said, her near miss with a ""crazy driver"" dismissed as just another joke. Later she emails to say she arrived safely at her destination. Just as well for Egypt's comedy fans, who will be looking to Hosny to help deliver the follow-up to the wildly successful ""Hysteria"" stand-up show held in Cairo earlier this year. Though little heard of just a few years ago, stand-up comedy is now serious business in Cairo and other cities across the Middle East, drawing huge crowds, according to comics in the region. And while western acts may have paved the way for this new enthusiasm for solo stage comics, the format has proved so popular that the region is now witnessing the rise of home-grown talent. ""It's a phenomenon,"" said Dean Obeidallah, an Arab-American comic whose 2008 ""Axis of Evil"" tour of the Middle East, featuring a cast of comedians from the region, is viewed by many as the catalyst for launching a new wave of comedy. Obeidallah will, next month, be reprising his role as executive producer of the Amman Stand-up Comedy Festival, a week-long event in the Jordanian capital. Perhaps aided by Jordan's more relaxed laws on censorship for the region, the Amman festival has, in three years, grown to become the biggest event of its kind in this part of the world, said Obeidallah. But Jordan is only the beginning, according to Obeidallah. ""The festival is representative of a bigger growth, a trend. In Saudi Arabia they have a thriving stand-up comedy scene with 10 or 12 comics doing regular shows. Same thing in Egypt, Lebanon, Oman and Qatar,"" he said. Though it might seem otherwise to outsiders, people in the Middle East are no strangers to humor, with rich traditions of comic storytelling. Veteran Jordanian comedian Nabil Sawalha has seen it all, performing in stage plays, television satire and sitcoms, but is now enjoying a new chapter in his long career thanks to stand-up. Says Sawalha, performances were initially held in English -- with comics drawing heavily on western influences -- but local language performers are now gaining confidence. ""Now it's taken off seriously in Arabic. I might be practically the only one who can do a whole evening, but there are a few young people coming up who can do five or 10 minutes here. ""They still need experience, but people are willing to venture and make a fool of themselves in front of other people, which is new."" While the language might have changed, the jokes themselves touch on themes familiar to western audiences, touching on the everyday topics of relationships, traffic, pop music, Facebook and Arabic culture. ""The Arabs in the region love to laugh at themselves, that's something we don't see in the Western media,"" says Obeidallah. ""If you don't do jokes about Arab culture in your show, they miss it because the level of laughs for those jokes are so much higher than for generic jokes about relationships or the state of the world."" Sherry Davey, a British-American comic who has been invited to perform in Amman for a second time, says her routine, which sees her offer ""comedy therapy"" to men in the audience, works equally well in Jordan as it does at home. ""Women all over the world are just as fed up of their husbands and tired of their bloody children as we are,"" she jokes. But, adds Obeidallah, in most Middle Eastern countries -- even in relatively liberal Jordan -- there are limits. Sex and cursing are to be avoided, as are jokes about religion and country leaders. ""I was in Lebanon and the producer of the show said say what you want but if you make fun of [militant group] Hezbollah you're on your own,"" he said. ""That was an effective message."" That said, some are already willing to take a few risks. ""I have been surprised by seeing some naught bits -- whether talking about farting or sex and some swear words here and there, and Jordanians take it and have a good laugh,"" says Sawalha, who refuses to remove political jokes from his own show. ""It's different elsewhere. I've performed in Beirut, Dubai and Qatar where the censors would cut a lot of my script -- but then I would go ahead and do it anyway."" He adds: ""In the Arab world we have so much political upheaval and so much tragedy that there is a lot of scope to turn these tragedies into comedy and laugh at them so that you can enjoy life.""","Stand-up comedy has blossomed over past five years in Middle East .

"London (CNN) -- When one looks back at humanity's great achievements, what do we think of -- the moon landings, decoding the human genome, elimination of small-pox, the invention of penicillin -- all have left their mark on our collective history. We can soon add a new defining achievement to this list -- everyone on the planet having access to clean, safe drinking water. All these achievements have required a great deal of effort, resources, and political commitment. Getting water to every person on the planet will be no exception, but it can and should be done, and done by 2030. Read/Watch: Welcome to Alakamisy . Over the last two decades an incredible two billion people have gained access to clean drinking water for the first time, so it's not such a pipe dream to argue that we should reach the remaining 783 million by this date. The difficulty will be that those who currently don't have access to this essential resource are the most difficult to reach, the most marginalized, the poorest, and the most politically disenfranchised. But that is also why getting water to those without is so important. Access to clean water has always been the foundation of human development, and it continues to this day, but thankfully, most of us can now take this for granted. Without water 'on tap' economies can't get going, children are more likely to drop out of school or just not attend in the first place and hospitals find it virtually impossible to cope with the spread of disease and infections. This has been and continues to be the reality for over one in ten people around the world. You can see for yourself, in WaterAid's new multi-media piece, the transformative impact that providing clean drinking water can have, by going on a virtual visit to the village of Alakamisy, a remote rural area of Madagascar that benefited from a WaterAid project in 2010. Don't take my word for it. Take a moment to listen to the story of Setraniona, who regularly suffered from water-borne diseases and had to drop out of school as a child before completing her education. Today because of the access to clean water in her community her own daughter will complete her education. Or Razanamalala who got a loan from the community water committee we helped set up. She invested that money in produce for her shop and six months on and she had paid back the loan in full. In a very real sense this is water promoting economic development. On a global scale the benefits in terms of money are enormous. As we have just highlighted in our new report, Everyone Everywhere, It's been calculated by economists at the World Health Organization (WHO), that we stand to gain $220 billion a year through universal access to both water and sanitation. For every $1 invested in water and sanitation results in an average of $4 in increased productivity. That is no drop in the ocean. Access for everyone to water, sanitation and hygiene would also save around 2.5 million lives every year. Currently diarrhoea alone kills around 2,000 children under the age of five every day, making it the second biggest cause of child death globally. So, why make this call now? Why put a time stamp on our endeavors to get water and sanitation to everyone? Well, world leaders are currently debating what to replace the Millennium Development Goals with when they expire in 2015. So the opportunity is there for our politicians to grasp. Back in 2000 when world leaders signed up to the original Millennium Development Goals, targets to tackle the sanitation crisis didn't feature. We at WaterAid and many other organizations around the globe convinced them to come back two years later and address this deficit, and in 2002 global targets were established to halve the proportion of the world's population without access to sanitation. We can't let this happen again, we cannot allow services as fundamental as water, sanitation and hygiene that have such a broad range of impacts across human development to be missed off the international agenda once more. So it's time to accept the challenge, in fact to rise to it. As an optimist, I believe fundamentally that our leaders have the capacity to get the job done, and then for time immemorial, we can stand back and acknowledge that we really have achieved something very special -- the end of thirst.

"Makhachkala, Russia (CNN) -- The building, No. 50, that members of the Tsarnaev family call home sits on a seemingly quiet street in Makhachkala. The capital of Dagestan, a semi-autonomous republic in southern Russia, borders the Caspian Sea on one side and on the other overlooks the Caucasus Mountains. For a time in 2012, Tamerlan Tsarnaev stayed here with his parents. He shopped at stores in Makhachkala, prayed at a local mosque. What authorities want to know is whether it was here that Tamerlan learned, or perhaps was inspired, to kill. The 26-year-old can't give an answer: He was killed after a shootout with U.S. authorities in Watertown, Massachusetts -- 5,500 miles from Makhachkala -- early Friday. Days earlier, authorities say, he and his 19-year-old brother, Dzhokhar -- who is in a Boston hospital -- blew up two bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Three people died and scores were wounded in that attack. FBI agents spent Wednesday in the Dagestani capital talking with Tamerlan and Dzhokhar's parents, according to an official in U.S. President Barack Obama's administration. The U.S. investigators were joined by members of Russia's Federal Security Service, human rights activist Kheda Saratova said. That ""conversation"" ended Wednesday evening, the suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, told Saratova. It's unclear what came of the parents' talk with U.S. and Russian authorities, though both parents had publicly insisted that their sons are innocent. But information has come out suggesting how Tamerlan Tsarnaev might have been influenced by his trip half a world from his Cambridge, Massachusetts, home. While Dagestan may be picturesque in many respects, it's also been home to violence and civil unrest. That includes gun and bomb attacks targeting security services, including a suicide bombing at a police checkpoint that left 12 dead and dozens wounded while Tsarnaev was believed to be here. After returning from his months-long visit to Russia, Tsarnaev created a YouTube channel that included two videos (since deleted) under a category labeled ""Terrorists."" Analysis by CNN and the SITE Intelligence Group has uncovered a screen grab from one of those videos featuring members of Imarat Kavkaz, a potent militant Islamist group in the north Caucasus, which includes Chechnya and Dagestan. Tsarnaev also appears to have posted and removed a video of a militant named Abu Dujan, a jihadist leader who was later killed by Russian troops. Did Tsarnaev interact with Abu Dujan during his time in southern Russia? Authorities haven't publicly said anything on that point, either way. Videos linked to his group show how to prepare homemade explosives from almost anywhere. Askhabali Saurbekov, the police chief in the Dagestani town of Kizilyurt, said Abu Dujan met with foreigners before his death. This group included men, like Tsarnaev, who were of Chechen origin. ""They met to exchange their bandit experience,"" Saurbekov said. CNN's Nic Robertson and Nick Paton Walsh reported from Makhachkala; Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","U.S. and Russian authorities interview Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's parents .

"(CNN) -- Britain's phone-hacking scandal has seen former tabloid editor Andy Coulson move from the newsroom into the full glare of its spotlight. Coulson was editor of the News of the World when evidence of illegal eavesdropping at the newspaper first emerged in 2005. As the fallout worsened, accusations of Coulson's involvement put even Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron - for whom Coulson later worked as communications director - on the defensive. On June 23, Coulson was found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones in a trial that opened last October at the Old Bailey in London, the UK's Press Association news agency reported. The trial saw prosecutors sift through Coulson's personal life as well as his professional career, with allegations, by prosecutors, that he and co-defendant Rebekah Brooks carried out a six-year affair being cited as evidence of their level of trust. Coulson began his career in journalism at The Basildon Echo in 1986, moving to the Sun in 1989 and the Daily Mail in 1993. In 1994, Coulson returned to The Sun, editing its ""Bizarre"" section, which focuses on showbiz news and gossip. Four years later he was promoted to the position of Associate Editor. He joined News of the World as its Deputy Editor in 2000, rising to the position of editor when Rebekah Brooks took the role of Chief Executive at News International. In January 2007, Coulson resigned from the News of the World after its then-royal editor, Clive Goodman, and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed for hacking into voice-mail messages left for royal aides. Coulson said he knew nothing about the hacking but resigned because he was editor of the paper at the time. In July of that year, then-opposition leader Cameron hired Coulson as his director of communications. Cameron became British prime minister in 2010, and Coulson moved with him to Downing Street. In January 2011, Coulson resigned as Downing Street spin doctor as coverage of the phone hacking scandal broadened. He insisted he was innocent but said he had become a distraction for the government. The original police investigation into phone-hacking had ended with Goodman and Mulcaire's convictions, but reports had continued to surface of the ""dark arts"" of the tabloid newsroom and a ""culture of phone hacking."" Police reopened their investigation the same month Coulson stepped down. In April 2011 News of the World officially apologized for hacking into voice mails from 2004 to 2006. The scandal exploded in July with the revelation that one of the hacking victims was Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old British girl whose phone was hacked after she disappeared in 2002. She was later found murdered. Arrest . Days later, Coulson was arrested in connection with allegations of phone hacking and corruption. ""I came in today voluntarily as I have been offering to do in the last few months,"" Coulson told reporters outside Lewisham Police station at the time. ""There is an awful lot I would like to say but I can't."" The scandal prompted questions over the British Prime Minister David Cameron's judgment in hiring Coulson. Cameron went on the defensive at a Downing Street news conference saying: ""The decision to hire him was mine, and mine alone."" He said he gave Coulson a second chance after receiving assurances that he had not been involved in wrongdoing at the newspaper. Questioned at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics the following May, Coulson said Goodman and Mulcaire's phone-hacking convictions did come up in discussions with senior party members before he was offered the job. He told the inquiry he had told them and Prime Minister Cameron that he knew nothing about the practice of hacking under his leadership of the paper. He also denied he was hired because of his links to News International [since rebranded News UK], the British arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which runs the UK's biggest selling daily tabloid, The Sun. Coulson said he had explained to Cameron and then-shadow chancellor George Osborne that his connections would not guarantee the backing of Murdoch's papers, and that they should reach out to a wide range of news outlets. The Sun switched its allegiance from the Labour Party to Cameron's Conservatives ahead of the 2010 election, which resulted in the formation of a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. Coulson said he never witnessed a conversation that was ""inappropriate"" between members of the government and News International. Cameron at Leveson . The following month, Cameron also told the inquiry Coulson had given him and others assurances that he knew nothing of the phone hacking while he was editor. Cameron said he knew that Coulson's appointment would be ""controversial"" but that the party felt his experience as a tabloid editor meant he was tough enough for the high-pressure role. The prime minister said he thought Coulson had done ""the honorable thing"" in resigning. Asked if he regretted the appointment, Cameron acknowledged it had come back to haunt both him and Coulson. ""You don't make decisions with 20/20 hindsight,"" he said. ""I made the decision I made,"" he said. ""I don't try to run away from it, I just try to explain why I made it."" While in the role, Coulson performed well and behaved entirely properly, he added. In July, 2012, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that eight people - including Coulson - would face charges related to phone hacking. Charges against one of the eight were later dropped. Coulson said he would fight the charges, stressing that he ""wouldn't and, more importantly, that I didn't, do anything to damage the Milly Dowler investigation."" He said his tabloid, quote ""worked on behalf of the victims of crime, particularly violent crime, and the idea that I would then sit in my office dreaming up schemes to undermine investigations is simply untrue."" Phone-hacking trial . The trial opened in October 2013. In November, prosecutors alleged that Coulson had a clandestine affair with co-accused Rebekah Brooks from 1998-2004, which they argued showed the pair's level of trust. Referring to a letter she had written to Coulson and which was produced in court, Brooks -- who was later cleared of all charges against her -- said: ""Andy and I were incredibly close at the time. He was my best friend. I think that comes across."" She denied there had been a long-standing affair but acknowledged there had been periods of physical intimacy. The alleged affair was seized on by UK media covering the case, with one newspaper - The Independent -- headlining its story ""The affair they didn't expose,"" a reference to the tabloid newspapers' history of revealing other people's cheating. The BBC and Guardian newspaper reported that when Coulson gave evidence in April - with his wife watching from the public gallery - he said the affair ""shouldn't have happened."" But he denied that it meant he and Brooks had shared sensitive stories, the outlets said. In January, a former News of the World journalist told the trial that his phone hacking skills were the main reason Coulson had hired him. Dan Evans testified that even ""the office cat"" knew about phone hacking at the tabloid. ""Coulson knew it,"" he claimed. However, Coulson has consistently denied any knowledge of phone-hacking. He claims he never heard the name of Glenn Mulcaire, the previously convicted private investigator, until Mulcaire's 2006 arrest for phone-hacking for News of the World. Coulson took the stand at the hacking trial in April. The Guardian reported that Coulson testified that ""with hindsight"" he had displayed some carelessness. "" Having being presented with all of this [as a result] of this very long investigation, I accept that I did not do enough. It doesn't mean I was party to [illegal activity at the tabloid],"" the Guardian quoted him as saying. Jurors disagreed, finding Coulson guilty of conspiracy to hack phones between 2000 and 2006. However, they were unable to reach a decision on charges of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office and he will face a retrial on those charges.","Andy Coulson left News of The World after its then-royal editor was jailed for phone hacking .

"(CNN) -- Sepp Blatter's controversial comments about racism in football are the latest in a long line of incidents that have embarrassed the FIFA president in the past decade. From matters such as accusations of financial mismanagement and corruption at world football's governing body, to his infamous declarations on homosexuality, women footballers, marital infidelity and sporting slavery, the 75-year-old is rarely out of the headlines. Blatter, now in his fourth and final term of office, has vowed to clean up FIFA's image but his legacy will forever be tainted by his public outbursts.

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Ethnic fighting once again engulfed Kenya's western Rift Valley on Sunday as witnesses and Red Cross officials reported brutal attacks by members of President Mwai Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe on other ethnic groups. The violence spread to the Rift Valley town of Naivasha on Sunday, where the Red Cross said there were reports of people being burned alive in their homes. Kenya's main opposition party and the Red Cross said as many as 30 people were killed. Ethnic killings continued in the nearby Rift Valley town of Nakuru, where another 47 people have died since the latest wave of violence began on Thursday, according to the opposition Orange Democratic Movement. The opposition death toll is much higher than police figures, which do not include Sunday's violence in Naivasha. Police say 31 people have died in the Rift Valley region since last Thursday.  Watch CNN's Zain Verjee report on the violence » . In a statement released Sunday, ODM leader Raila Odinga condemned reports of 30 people being burned alive in their Naivasha homes and blamed the Kibaki government for fomenting the violence in the region. ""I condemn this murderous and evil act in the strongest terms possible,"" he said. ""What is now emerging is that criminal gangs, in a killing spree, working under police protection, are part of a well-orchestrated plan of terror."" It is a dramatic turn of events, considering Odinga was shaking Kibaki's hand three days ago after the two met under the auspices of former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Many had hoped Thursday's meeting, arranged by Annan who is mediating peace efforts, would bring an end to the outbreak of bloody ethnic battles that followed last month's contested presidential vote. But it seems to have had the opposite effect. Odinga blamed Kibaki's government for orchestrating the Rift Valley violence ""to try to influence mediation efforts"" and ""to divert (attention) from election malpractice to security and violence."" ""After stealing the elections from Kenyans, Kibaki now wishes to deny them justice and peace,"" Odinga said. A Red Cross official said the agency had received reports of a non-Kikuyu family burned to death in their house in Naivasha. Television footage showed a man in the back of a police vehicle covered in blood with a large machete wound on the side of his head. Kenyan police dispersed large gangs and cleared rocks littering the streets of the lakeside town, which is dominated by Kikuyu. Tree branches, heavy boulders and oil drums littered the streets of Naivasha's town center as the Kikuyu gangs erected temporary road blocks, CNN correspondent Zain Verjee reported. She said the atmosphere was tense as the gangs checked cars to identify rival tribes. Verjee said there was a heavy police presence on the outskirts of the town. Some shops remained open but the town center was almost deserted except for the roaming gangs. It was a similar situation in Nakuru on Sunday, where ODM member the Rev. Mike Brawan said members of the Kikuyu tribe ""are flushing out the non-Kikuyus from their houses."" He said Kikuyus are going house-to-house, attacking civilians who are not members of the tribe, as well as looting and burning their property. Police, he said, ""are not doing much."" Brawan said he saw homes burned and people hacked to death in the violence. ""They just die with a lot of pain,"" he said. It is estimated -- depending on the source -- that between 500 and 1,000 people have been killed in the violence that followed the December 27 election in which Kibaki kept his post. Odinga, the OMD candidate for president, and his supporters claim the election was rigged. International observers noted some irregularities in the voting. Fighting, centered in western Kenya and Nairobi's slums, broke out between tribes loyal to Kibaki and Odinga after Kibaki was declared the winner of recent elections. E-mail to a friend .

"Washington (CNN) -- Move over, Elton John. Take a seat, Katy Perry, you left the Grammys last night without a golden gramophone. But Staff Sgt. Brandie Lane is returning to West Point clutching the golden hardware. The new soldier is living the Hollywood dream: She won a Grammy Award. Until she joined the U.S. Army last summer, Lane worked as head audio engineer at Sono Luminus, a record label in Winchester, Virginia, that specializes in classical and jazz music. And Sunday night, she won a Grammy for the Best Engineered Album, Classical category. Lane was one of four engineers to work on Quincy Porter's album ""The Complete Viola Works"" and was in charge of mixing and mastering the album. She was hired by Sono Luminus right out of the University of Miami in 2006. She's now an audio engineer for the West Point Band. ""I'm envious they got her but very proud,"" said Daniel Shores, the label's managing director. Lane was also the engineer on two other Grammy-nominated albums from the label. The Grammy for the Porter album is the first for the Sono Luminus label. Lane attended the ceremony at Los Angeles' Staples Center in a black gown, a stark contrast to stars' fashions, such as the translucent egg shell that Lady Gaga featured on the red carpet. She went to Saturday's special merit awards dinner in her formal Army band uniform, called ""Concert Blues."" ""The whole experience was literally a dream come true. Being honored among colleagues and living icons was purely inspirational,"" Lane said in a West Point news release Monday. ""I'm forever grateful to all those who have helped me and guided me through this aspect of my life."" Almost as big a thrill as winning the Grammy was the chance to see Julie Andrews in person. The 75-year-old actress and singer received a Lifetime Grammy Award. ""Julie Andrews is still as gorgeous as she ever was,"" Lane said. ""She's the classiest woman in the world."" Lane said she'd like to have a career in the Army but hopes to do some freelance work in the commercial music business, which her commanders at the West Point Band encourage. One thing she hasn't decided is where she'll put her golden gramophone. Her place is a little small, she said, but she'll ""figure it out.""","NEW: Staff Sgt.

"(CNN) -- The deal is off. The suit is on. Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling is withdrawing his support for the sale of his team and is asking his lawyer to go ahead with a $1 billion lawsuit against the NBA. ""From the onset, I did not want to sell the Los Angeles Clippers. I have worked for 33 years to build the Team,"" Sterling said in a statement, forwarded to CNN by his lawyer Max Blecher. Referring to NBA commissioner, Sterling added, ""I believe that Adam Silver acted in haste by illegally ordering the forced sale of the Clippers, banning me for life from the NBA and imposing the fine. ... The action taken by Adam Silver and the NBA constitutes a violation of my rights and fly in the face of the freedoms that are afforded to all Americans."" It's exactly the kind of move that made Silver wary of the litigious Sterling. ""He's unsold his club several times over the years,"" Silver told CNN's Rachel Nichols in an exclusive interview this week. ""There's well-noted incidents in the league when he was right there at a closing and at the last minute decided not to sell."" Sterling, 80, has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with friend V. Stiviano revealed he made a series of racist comments. The comments sparked outrage among NBA players, executives and fans. The commissioner fined Sterling $2.5 million and pushed to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise. ""To be clear, I am extremely sorry for the hurtful statements I made privately,"" Sterling said in his statement. ""I made those statements in anger and out of jealousy all in the context of a private conversation. While this is not an excuse for the statements, like every other American, I never imagined that my private conversation would be made public."" Back and forth . Sterling has seemingly changed his mind multiple times about what he wants to happen to the team. In late May, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer laid down a $2 billion offer to buy the Clippers. Sterling's estranged wife and co-owner of team, Shelly, agreed to sell the franchise to Ballmer. Sterling initially indicated he would fight that sale. He also filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the NBA for its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise. But his attorneys said last week that Sterling supported the team's sale to Ballmer. The attorneys said last Wednesday that the lawsuit had yet to be withdrawn, but said that would likely happen in the coming days. Now, it appears, the Sterling's fight is back on.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli police arrested Tuesday an immigrant from the former Yugoslavia who is suspected of participating in the 1995 massacre in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. Aleksander Cvetkovic immigrated to Israel with his wife, who is Jewish, and children in 2006 and received Israeli citizenship, said a statement from the Israeli Justice Ministry. The Israeli state prosecutor's office received an extradition request for him last August from the Bosnian government. The decision to open an extradition process came after months of examining evidence. That evidence exposes shocking details of the massacre of Muslims at Braniewo farm, the ministry said. ""Hundreds of Bosnian civilians were bused to the farm handcuffed and blindfolded. They were led to the killing fields where firing squads made up of Bosnian-Serb soldiers shot them in cold blood,"" the ministry said. Cvetkovic actively participated in the massacre and was one of eight soldiers in the firing squad, the state prosecutor's office said. The extradition process, it said, is part of ""an international legal action that investigates and prosecutes those responsible for planning and carrying out genocide."" About 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in Srebrenica in 1995. Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb president at the time, is accused of being responsible for the massacre. Srebrenica became an emblem for the dissolution of Yugoslavia -- once a multi-ethnic state of Serbs, Croats, Muslims and others -- into six countries during bloody and brutal conflicts in the early 1990s.

"(CNN) -- New York's governor, citing questions about the driver's ""criminal record and driving history,"" on Monday ordered the state's inspector general to investigate how a Brooklyn man got licensed to drive a bus that crashed over the weekend, leading to the deaths of 15 people. The driver, 40-year-old Ophadell Williams, has not been charged. Police said Williams told investigators that the incident occurred early Saturday after he swerved to avoid a tractor-trailer that might have clipped the bus. The bus then flipped on its side and smashed into the poles, which cut through two-thirds of the vehicle. Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed Inspector General Ellen Biben to ""commence an immediate investigation"" in light of issues related to Williams' ""criminal record and driving history."" In a statement, Cuomo questioned why Williams was able to get and keep a commercial driver's license. Staff from the inspector general's office will coordinate with the New York state police, as well as the Bronx district attorney's office, in the investigation, according to Cuomo. Williams fatally stabbed a man about 20 years ago, leading to a manslaughter conviction, said New York Department of Correctional Services spokeswoman Linda Foglia. He served three of the nine years he was sentenced, from 1992 to 1994. He was later convicted of grand larceny, leading him to spend parts of the years 1998 to 2002 behind bars, according to Foglia. A New York City official said Monday that a 15th person had died because of injuries related to the crash, which took place in the Bronx, about 5:30 a.m. on a stretch of I-95 called the New England Thruway not far from Westchester County. The bus had left the Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, and was bound for Chinatown in Manhattan, according to news reports. Along with those killed, at least seven of the 31 passengers suffered severe injuries and were transported to area hospitals with the remaining survivors. At least five people being treated at New York's St. Barnabas Hospital suffered skull and spinal fractures, internal bleeding and broken bones, Dr. Ernest Patti told reporters. Williams suffered ""non-life threatening injuries,"" police said. Police recovered a tractor-trailer that was traveling through the area at the time and interviewed its driver. The driver of the tractor-trailer denied that two vehicles collided before the bus crashed, a law enforcement source told CNN. Federal investigators are considering other potential causes of the crash, including mechanical problems, steering and brake issues as well as the possibility the driver fell asleep. Some surviving passengers, according to news reports, told police that they felt the bus roll over rumble strips before the crash. At a Sunday afternoon press conference, National Transportation Safety Board Vice-Chairman Christopher Hart said investigators are looking for video recordings taken at the casino and, possibly, an electronic hotel key card that might track some of Williams' activities within 72 hours of the accident. Investigators previously admitted they are examining Williams' background and testing his blood for the presence of alcohol. Police officials also have said they are looking into the possibility that Williams had been speeding prior to the accident. Two UPS couriers told CNN affiliate WABC-TV that they twice saw the bus traveling very fast on the highway before the accident. In addition, records on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website show that the bus line involved -- World Wide Travel -- was involved in a crash in New York in 2009 that resulted in one injury, and a crash in New Jersey in 2010 resulting in one injury. The company has been cited five times for ""fatigued driving"" between December 2009 and October 2010 -- twice in in New Jersey, twice in Pennsylvania and once in Connecticut, records show.","Gov.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has started a force to battle pirates attacking ships in and near the Gulf of Aden off Somalia's coast, the U.S. Fifth Fleet said Thursday. A U.S. Navy photo shows a ship held by pirates off the coast of Somalia in November. The unit -- called Combined Task Force 151 -- is a spinoff of an existing force in the region that addressed a range of security issues, such as drug smuggling and weapons trafficking, as well as piracy. The Gulf of Aden links the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. About 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year near largely lawless Somalia. The United States is among at least 20 countries that are trying to combat piracy in the region, including Russia, India, Germany and Iran. In December, German sailors foiled an attempt by pirates to hijack an Egyptian cargo ship off the coast of Yemen, according to the German Defense Ministry, and the European Union launched its first naval operation to protect vessels. That came just days after China revealed its own plans to patrol the Horn of Africa's volatile coastline. Task Force 151 will be devoted solely to counterpiracy efforts, said Lt. Stephanie Murdock, a Fifth Fleet spokeswoman. The United States anticipates other nations joining the force ""in the near future."" ""The problem of piracy is and continues to be a problem that begins ashore and is an international problem that requires an international solution,"" Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, commander of the Combined Maritime Forces, said in a news release from the Fifth Fleet in Manama, Bahrain. ""We believe the establishment of CTF-151 is a significant step in the right direction."" The financial and human costs of piracy are extensive. Ships ranging from luxury yachts to a Saudi supertanker have been held for ransom. At least one major company pulled its ships from the Gulf of Aden region in 2008, meaning cargo bound for Europe had to round the African continent rather than use the Suez Canal. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  See how pirate attacks peaked in 2008 » . ""The pirates are living between life and death,"" a pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah, told the Somali news organization Garowe Online late last year. CNN obtained the complete interview. ""Who can stop them?"" Boyah said. ""Americans and British all put together cannot do anything."" Boyah said that the piracy began because traditional coastal fishing became difficult after foreign fishing trawlers depleted local fish stocks. Traditional fishermen started attacking the trawlers until the trawler crews fought back with heavy weapons. The fishermen then turned to softer targets. ""We went into the deep ocean and hijacked the unarmed cargo ships,"" Boyah said. ""For the past three years, we have not operated near the Somali coast. We have operated at least 80 miles [out], in international waters."" British journalist Colin Freeman and Spanish photojournalist Jose Cendon, both working for London's Daily Telegraph newspaper, were released Sunday after being held by pirates who abducted them November 26 in the Somali city of Bosasso. Two Somali journalists, who have not been heard from, were also taken, according to the  New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Task Force 151 is an outgrowth of Combined Task Force-150, which was created to conduct security operations at the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom -- the U.S. effort in Afghanistan. The task forces are part of the Combined Maritime Forces, which includes naval ships and other assets from more than 20 nations. ""Some navies in our coalition did not have the authority to conduct counter-piracy missions,"" Gortney said. ""The establishment of CTF-151 will allow those nations to operate under the auspices of CTF-150, while allowing other nations to join CTF-151 to support our goal of deterring, disrupting and eventually bringing to justice the maritime criminals involved in piracy events."" Michael Howlett, divisional director of the International Maritime Bureau, said attacks haven't stopped, but they have not been as successful recently. He cited the presence of navies in the gulf and the fact that merchant mariners are taking more appropriate measures to avert hijackings as reasons for the decline. He welcomed the establishment of the task force. ""We strongly believe the navies are the only effective response against piracy,"" he said, adding that the navies in the region ""are doing a great job."" The U.S. Navy praised merchant mariners' measures against pirate attacks, such as raising ladders, posting lookouts, speeding up, taking evasive maneuvers and using fire hoses. ""The most effective measures we've seen to defeat piracy are non-kinetic and defensive in nature,"" Gortney said. ""The merchant ships have been doing a great job stepping up and utilizing these methods to defeat piracy attempts.""","U.S. Fifth Fleet hoping other nations will join anti-piracy force .

"(CNN) -- The phone hacking trial of Rebekah Brooks and other newspaper executives revealed much about the inner workings of Rupert Murdoch's sex-and-scandal tabloids the News of the World and the Sun. News of the World closed in July 2011, amid public revulsion at the hacking of a missing 13-year-old, Milly Dowler. The Sun, later also edited by Brooks, remains Britain's best-selling newspaper. Here are 7 eye-catching disclosures from Court 12 of the Old Bailey in London. 1. Hacking round the clock . The News of the World carried out phone hacking on a grand scale. A Metropolitan Police detective, Steven Fitzgerald, told the trial that in the two years before the police pounced on the operation in August 2006, News of the World's private detective, Glenn Mulcaire, and journalists made 6,813 calls to 281 unique voicemail numbers, or UVNs. Calls to UVNs were described as attempted or successful hacks of mobile phone messages. Among those whose messages were eavesdropped leading politicians, such as Home Secretary David Blunkett, in charge of police and the fight against terrorism, the England football manager Sven Goran Eriksson, and the actors Jude Law, Sienna Miller and Daniel Craig, the current James Bond. The Metropolitan Police estimate 1,000 people were hacked by the News of the World. 2. Hot line to Kate Middleton . The News of the World eavesdropped on the private world of Princes William and Harry -- and William's then-girlfriend Kate Middleton. Their hacking was kept secret during the first, limited police investigation into phone hacking in 2007. But it was revealed at the current trial that the paper's royal editor Clive Goodman had hacked Middleton, the current Duchess of Cambridge, 155 times -- including on Valentine's Day 2006. He hacked Prince William 35 times and Prince Harry on nine occasions. Among the exclusives the News of the World unearthed were that William got lost on an Army training exercise and that Middleton called him ""babykins."" 3. Rooting through bins . Although the News of the World portrayed itself as a beacon of morality in a sleazy world, it appears it was not averse to picking through people's bins in the search for a tale. On one of the whiteboards seized from his home in August 2006, the paper's private detective, Glenn Mulcaire, wrote the word: ""Binology."" The word ""binology"" -- rooting through people's rubbish to find interesting documents -- also appeared on an invoice submitted to the News of the World by a private detective in 2001, when it was edited by Brooks. She told the trial: ""There was a particular private detective who worked for various newspapers who would go through bins, lawyers' bins and high-profile people: Benji the Binman. And he would sell that information to newspapers."" She said she might have had some anxiety about using binology. 4. Cash for defense stories . While being edited by Brooks, The Sun paid a defense official for exclusive stories about the deaths of soldiers in Afghanistan, military scandals and titillating examples of indiscipline in the ranks. In all the Sun paid Â£100,000 paid to Bettina Jordan Barber, a mid-ranking official at Ministry of Defence official who liaised with the MoD's press bureau, between 2004 and 2012. The resulting headlines included: ""Mucky major's a sex swinger,"" ""Major feels privates' privates"" and ""The Lust Post."" 5. Close the News of the World ... and land a TV deal . A month before the News of the World closed, executives discussed closing it -- to help a controversial takeover. Jurors were shown an email from Simon Greenberg, director of corporate affairs at News International, News Corp's UK newspaper arm, to Brooks and another executive in early June 2011. At that time Scotland Yard had intensified its inquiry into hacking and a growing number of hacking victims were suing for breach of privacy. ""This is why we should consider the shutdown option,"" Greenberg wrote. ""Is the brand too toxic for itself or the company? I believe it is. Unparalleled moments need unparalleled action. You could be the person to save the Rubicon deal."" Rubicon was News Corp's codename for its Â£7 billion bid for the UK's biggest commercial broadcaster, BSkyB. News Corp abandoned the bid amid the furor over phone hacking allegations. 6. From Tony Blair with a kiss . News International had close links with politicians, particularly with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. On July 16, 2011 as the hacking scandal swirled around the company -- and on the eve of Brooks's arrest -- the former Labour leader offered to help her prepare for an appearance before a House of Commons committee at which she would be grilled about hacking. Blair texted Brooks: ""If you're still going to parliament you should call me. I have experience of these things! Tx"" She said she was ""feeling properly terrified,"" adding: ""Police are behaving so badly."" The former PM responded with help about the police interview: ""Everyone panics in these situations and they will feel they have their reputation to recover. Assume you have quality QC advice? When's the interview?"" Later, Blair added: ""I'm no use on police stuff but call me after that because I may be some help on Commons. Brooks replied: ""Great. Will do. X"" 7. The affair that dare not be printed . While the News of the World exposed other people's extra-marital affairs, its married leading executives were having one themselves, the court heard. On a computer belonging to Brooks, detectives found a draft letter written by the former News of the World editor to its then editor, Andy Coulson in 2004 which suggested they had been having an affair for six years. The prosecution suggested the closeness of that relationship meant Brooks must have known about phone hacking when her lover was editing the paper -- which she denied. In a passage from the letter read out to the court by a prosecutor, Brooks wrote: ""The fact is you are my very best friend, I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you, we laugh and cry together."" No British newspaper exposed their affair, though it made front-page headlines a decade later. When a lawyer suggested to Coulson that the relationship was ""pure hypocrisy,"" he replied: ""The irony is not lost on me.""","Jurors returned their verdicts in the UK's 8-month-long phone hacking trial on June 23 .

"(CNN) -- The businessman son of embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appears to be out of rebel hands and says he wants to negotiate a cease-fire to save Tripoli from ""a sea of blood."" In an e-mail exchange with CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson, Saadi Gadhafi -- whose capture had been announced by the rebel leadership on Sunday -- said he had the authority to negotiate and wanted to discuss a cease-fire with U.S. and NATO officials. ""I will try to save my city Tripoli and 2 millions of people living there ... otherwise Tripoli will be lost forever like Somalia,"" he wrote. Without a cease-fire, he added, ""Soon it will be a sea of blood."" Saadi Gadhafi was one of three sons of the now-hunted Libyan leader who the rebel National Transitional Council announced had been captured during their weekend advance on Tripoli. However, they said Monday that one of the other two, Mohammed Gadhafi, had escaped.

"(CNN) -- One of the most enduring mysteries of the 20th century has been put to rest: DNA analysis of bone fragments has proven that two of Czar Nicholas' children believed to have escaped were killed with their royal family during the Russian Revolution. Czar Nicholas II, from left, daughters Olga, Maria, wife Alexandra, kids Anastasia, Alexei and Tatiana in 1917. The chemically damaged and burnt remains were found in the Romanov family's makeshift grave outside the city of Yekaterinburg, Russia, in 2007. In 2008, scientists used bone and tooth fragments to identify the remains as those of the two missing children of Czar Nicholas II: 13-year-old Crown Prince Alexei, the emperor's only son and heir to the throne, and his sister Grand Duchess Maria, about 19. Researchers wanted to confirm their findings by comparing DNA from the remains with that of living Romanov relatives. The results of the DNA analysis were published online Tuesday in the journal PloS One. The Romanov family, the last Russian monarchy, was executed in 1918 by Bolsheviks in the basement of a home in Yekaterinburg, about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) east of Moscow. Several of their staff members and servants also were killed. Nicholas' reign had ended when he abdicated the throne in 1917 at the time of the Russian Revolution. The remains of the family were discovered in 1991, during the last days of the Soviet Union. In 1998, those remains -- of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and three daughters -- were interred in a cathedral in St. Petersburg that contains the crypts of other Russian royalty. At the time, many thought that Alexei and Maria might have escaped -- leading to hopes among royal supporters that one or both Romanovs were still alive. But clues left by one of the family's assassins led investigators to the grave where the remains of Alexei and Maria were unearthed in 2007. The drama surrounding the Romanovs has been the subject of many books, movies and documentaries. Several women have claimed that they were Anastasia, Nicholas' youngest daughter, contending that they escaped the executions. The body of one impostor, Anna Anderson, was cremated when she died in 1984. DNA tests showed she was not related to the Romanov family.","Researchers compared DNA of remains with that of living Romanov relatives .

"(CNN) -- Doctors in Spain say they have carried out the world's first full face transplant on a man who severely damaged his face in an accident. Doctors at Barcelona's Vall d'Hebron University Hospital say they were able to give the man a new nose, lips, teeth and cheekbones during 24 hours of surgery. Thirty doctors were part of the surgery that occurred in late March. The patient had undergone nine failed operations before being considered for the transplant. The medical team's leader, Joan Pere Barret, told reporters that the patient was satisfied when he saw his new appearance. He has scars on his forehead and neck, but they will be concealed in the future, Barret said. ""'The patient asked to see himself one week after the surgery, and he reacted very calmly and with satisfaction, and when we asked him -- in writing, because we communicate with writing and gestures -- he said he was very grateful and satisfied,"" Barret said. Although this is the first total face transplant, there have been partial face transplants in France, the United States, China and Spain. The first was when doctors operated on Isabelle Dinoire in Amiens, France, in 2005. She had been mauled by her dog. In 2008, the United States had its first-ever near-total face transplant. Connie Culp, injured by a bullet in 2004, received the nose, upper lip and cheekbones of a donor in a 22-hour operation at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- For more than 30 years, Betty Alonso has held on to a glittery concert scarf Michael Jackson sent her when she was 12 after the two met face-to-face after a concert in Caracas, Venezuela. But now Alonso, the mother of three, has decided to sell the scarf and the accompanying handwritten letter signed by the pop star to the highest bidder. ""I'll hold the memory in my heart and in my mind,"" Alonso said, but she added now she could use the money to help pay for her children's private school, or a new roof. She's among more than 30 fans, associates and family members of Michael Jackson who contacted Julien's Auctions to sell their gifts and collectibles tied to the King of Pop. An auction is slated November 21 at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York's Times Square. Some of the highlights of the more than 80 items are directly tied to the singer's legendary career: the white glove Jackson wore when unveiling his moonwalk to the world, his handwritten lyrics to ""Beat It,"" zombie costumes and the mold used to make his fangs for the video ""Thriller,"" and a fedora he wore during his lengthy performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1995. The auction is being handled by Julien's, the same company that had planned to sell about 2,000 items from Jackson's Neverland Ranch in April. That auction was canceled by Jackson the same week his belongings went on public display. ""We had been promoting this sale for four or five months all over the world. We had hundreds of thousands of people registering to bid for the sale,"" said Darren Julien, president and CEO of Julien's Auctions. ""All these people were hungry for something or a piece of Michael Jackson, so what it did was whet the appetite."" That's why, according to Julien, his company was tops on the list when people wanted to sell their belongings that had ties to Jackson after he died in June. ""Michael was very generous,"" Julien said. ""If you were friends with Michael Jackson or an important part of his life, occasionally he would give something away, and that's a very big reason that these things got out in the public."" That's apparently what happened with the white, jeweled glove Jackson wore when he amazed crowds by performing the moonwalk during the Motown 25th anniversary television special in 1983. Backstage, after the performance, Walter Orange of the Commodores said he asked for Jackson's autograph. Jackson gave him the glove instead. The two had a long history -- the Commodores opened for the Jackson 5 in the early '70s. ""The legacy that (Jackson) left behind is bigger than life for me,"" said Orange. ""I hope that through that glove people can see what he was trying to say in his music and what he said in his music -- we need to come together as one."" The glove is estimated between $40,000 to $60,000, but Julien said he expects bids to reach ""the six-figure range,"" Orange said. He plans to give a portion of the proceeds to charity. ""I had that. I owned it, and now the world should see it,"" Orange said. The auction also allows the world to see photographs of Jackson engaged in simple activities with ordinary items, thus increasing their value. That's the case of a 1985 Mercedes-Benz 500 SEL that Jackson owned and ultimately gave to an aunt as a birthday gift. She changed the license plate to an abbreviated form of ""Thanks Michael."" ""What's even more significant is that we have photos of Michael driving the car,"" Julien said. ""When have you seen Michael driving a car? He was always chauffeured or driven."" Julien said the car is in great condition with bells and whistles Jackson wanted, including tinted windows and an elaborate sound system. An acoustic guitar that Jackson was photographed playing during his breaks on the set of the 1978 film ""The Wiz"" belonged to a movie make-up artist and is estimated at $6,000 to $8,000. ""These were the very few times Michael ever played guitar,"" Julien said. ""He was a singer, a performer on stage, but not with a guitar."" Among the oddest item is a chocolate bar stamped ""Lisa Marie and Michael"" to commemorate Jackson's marriage to Lisa Marie Presley. The bar is estimated at a couple hundred dollars. Julien said he accepted that item because it reminded him of a piece of wedding cake from the marriage of Britain's Prince Charles and Diana that he auctioned for $7,000 years ago. Julien said there's another significant item tied to a fedora Jackson wore at the 1995 MTV Music Video Awards. The hat was auctioned at a charity event that same year and the letter of verification is signed ""Lisa Marie Presley Jackson."" ""To my knowledge, there were not a lot of letters that she signed with her full name,"" Julien said. There are a number of autographed photos, as well as signed books, collectibles and artwork. There are even a few two-fers for autograph seekers: a painting of Jackson with Elizabeth Taylor, signed by the celebrated friends, and a backstage pass to a Democratic National Convention fundraiser at the Apollo Theater in New York, autographed by Jackson and former President Bill Clinton. Even Jackson's doodles and sketches of the likes of Frankenstein, Mickey Mouse and Charlie Chaplin are up for sale. Julien said basically, anything the King of Pop touched is valued by fans and investors alike. ""He really was a living legend when he was alive, but now he's right there with the ranks of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe,"" Julien said. ""I think that Michael looking down on us right now would get a kick out of the fact that there are so many fans that just want a piece of him.""","Fans and associates of Michael Jackson have contacted Julien's Auctions to sell gifts, collectibles .

"(CNN) -- An Egyptian court has dissolved the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported Saturday -- the government's latest move against the Islamist movement whose fortunes have plummeted since former President Mohamed Morsy's ouster last year. The supreme administrative court's decision dissolves the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, which Morsy had once led. The development is another in a string of moves by the current military-backed government to force the Brotherhood underground. Hundreds of its members have been arrested since last year, and many sentenced to death. Morsy himself is in jail and on trial for allegedly inciting murder and other offenses. Egypt's rulers long suppressed the Islamist movement until 2011, when protests led to strongman Hosni Mubarak's ouster. Newly unfettered, Brotherhood members ran for office and Morsy, backed by the Freedom and Justice Party, became Egypt's first democratically elected president in June 2012. But he was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule, with opponents accusing him of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Since then, Cairo's military-installed government has banned the Brotherhood, branding it a terrorist group -- an allegation it denies -- and accusing it of being behind a wave of deadly attacks on the police and military. In June, a court upheld death sentences imposed on Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie and 182 of the group's supporters, who were convicted of taking part in a deadly attack on a police station last year. The men can appeal the verdicts to a higher court. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who led Morsy's ouster, was elected President in May after leaving the military to run for the office. Brotherhood supporters say the government that replaced Morsy has returned to Mubarak's authoritarian practices. Muslim Brotherhood leader, 36 others sentenced to life in Cairo .

"(CNN) -- He is self coached, he relies on YouTube videos to hone his technique -- and in running-mad Kenya, he had to plead with officials to win selection for the track and field team as a javelin thrower. Julius Yego may not have won a medal at the 2012 London Olympics but his achievement in just qualifying and then reaching the final in this specialist discipline was a triumph over adversity. ""I do not have a coach, my motivation comes from within. Training without a coach is not an easy thing,"" he told CNN's Human to Hero series. But this obvious handicap did not prevent him hurling the 800-gram spear 81.81 meters -- his personal best, breaking his own national record -- in qualifying in London to join his sport's elite. Yego eventually finished 12th in the final behind Keshorn Walcott of Trinidad and Tobago, who shocked the likes of two-time defending champion Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway to win a surprise gold. Walcott's upset victory, only the second by a non-European in Olympic javelin competition, should act as encouragement to Yego, who is not short of self belief. ""I want to be a legend and leave a legacy,"" he said. ""My focus now is on the 2013 World Championships in Moscow. I am trying to be in the top three. I have to move into the medal bracket, not just in the finals."" Yego had to battle ""a lot of challenges"" to gain acceptance in his own country as a world-class athlete. The 23-year-old hails from a village in the Rift Valley, the traditional breeding ground for the seemingly endless stream of Kenyan distance runners who have enjoyed such success in distances from 800 meters to the marathon. The fourth child in a family of nine, he took up the javelin at secondary school when he realized he wasn't going to be a successful footballer. ""My first-born sister used to encourage me, my mum also, but my dad sometimes was angry with me,"" Yego said. ""Most of my time I was going out of school, no learning, so he was a bit angry with me. But after I proved him wrong he let me continue with this sport."" Yego briefly dabbled with the track, but at a stocky 85 kg his physique is more suited to an event like the javelin and its incredible technical demands. It helped that an elder brother was also a javelin thrower at their elementary school, and he was also inspired by watching the 2004 Athens Games on the television. ""It just took me, I wanted to be like Andreas Thorkildsen,"" he said. Little could he have realized that eight years later, Yego would be competing against his hero in an Olympic final. With no specialist javelin coaches in Kenya, the then teenager turned to technology to see what Thorkildsen and other great champions such as Czech Jan Zelezny were doing. ""I watched YouTube and it really paid off for me, to see the training techniques and skills they are using,"" he said. Yego first made his mark with third place at the 2010 African championships in Kenya's capital of Nairobi, but disappointment followed at the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi later that year as he was well below his best in finishing seventh. His big breakthrough came in 2011 at the All-Africa Games, but he nearly did not make it to the championships in Mozambique, which were to prove pivotal to his career and eventual qualification for the 2012 Olympics. Yego was initially told he would be going with the Kenyan team to the event, but three days later came the shattering news that he would not be making the trip. ""I rang one of the officials in our federation and I asked what was happening,"" he recalls. ""He told me we don't have enough cash to accommodate all of you, so I told him you can remove one of the runners so you can give me a chance!"" Yego's confrontation with officialdom clearly struck a chord, and three days later he was reinstated on the team. He repaid their faith with a national record of 78.20m to become the first Kenyan to win javelin gold at the All-Africa Games. It also led to an invite from the IAAF, the world governing body of track and field, to go on a six-month scholarship to its center in Kuortane, Finland, the traditional home of javelin. Returning in the spring of 2012, Yego achieved the qualifying mark for the London Olympics and threw further than 80m for the first time later in the summer. Now he could not be ignored by the Kenyan selectors and his dream was about to become reality, admittedly as the only field event athlete in a 44-strong team. ""My Olympic experience is something I will never forget. I'm an Olympian now, not everyone can be Olympian,"" he said. Like many top Kenyan athletes, Yego has a job with the national police force, but is allowed ample time to train between four to five hours per day, working on specialist exercises in the gym, jumps over hurdles and a throwing routine. ""Javelin requires a combination of speed, skill and power, and if you don't combine all of them, you cannot get it right,"" he said. ""I was born with the talent, but the skills I have had to work on."" Thorkildsen remains his reference point. ""Andreas is a unique guy, he's very skilful,"" Yego said. ""He does some gymnastics (in training) you cannot do. ""When I watch his squats he's doing almost 200 kg and I was doing 90, so you can see it's a very big range, but now I'm doing 150. ""When I read his biography, he started training when he was just 11, so you can see he's far ahead of everybody."" Still battling the lack of specialist facilities, Yego goes it alone, spending hours every day training at the Kasarani stadium in Nairobi. ""What I love about the javelin, when you throw and you hit it right, when it's flying in the sky, you feel so nice.""","Julius Yego is first Kenyan to qualify for a field event at the Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Americans should avoid all but essential travel to all or parts of 14 Mexican states, the U.S. State Department warns as violence has spread. Shootouts, kidnappings and carjackings have climbed, as have cartels, also known as transnational criminal organizations (TCO), the State Department said this week in a broadened travel warning. While millions of U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico every year, the country's ongoing violence and security concerns pose risks for U.S. citizens, and travelers should take precautions, the State Department advises. ""The TCOs themselves are engaged in a violent struggle to control drug trafficking routes and other criminal activity. As a result, crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country and can occur anywhere. U.S. citizens have fallen victim to TCO activity, including homicide, gun battles, kidnapping, carjacking and highway robbery,"" its alert says. More than 47,500 people were killed in drug-related violence in Mexico between December 2006 and September 2011, according to the State Department. While most of those murdered were involved in criminal activity, innocent people were also caught in the crossfire, the State Department said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon declared a crackdown on cartels in late 2006. The number of Americans reported murdered in Mexico last year was 120 -- up from 35 reported in 2007. ""We strongly advise you to lower your profile and avoid displaying any evidence of wealth that might draw attention,"" the alert says. The travel warning urges Americans to defer nonessential travel to all or parts of the following 14 states: Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tamaulipas, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacan and Nayarit. Travelers should also exercise caution visiting all or parts of Baja California, Colima and Morelos, it says. The previous U.S. travel warning issued for Mexico by the State Department, dated in April, advised American to avoid travel to all or parts of 10 states.","Americans are urged to avoid travel to all or parts of 14 states .

"(CNN) -- Jefferson Thomas, one of the so-called ""Little Rock Nine,"" the nine students who integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957, has died, according to Carlotta Walls LaNier, president of the group's foundation. He was 67. Thomas died of pancreatic cancer on Sunday, the Little Rock Nine Foundation said in a statement. He was living in Columbus, Ohio. As a 15-year-old, Thomas was one of the nine African-American students who braved segregationist mobs to integrate the all-white school under the protection of military forces. A retired federal accountant for the Department of Defense, Thomas ""had spent the last decade of his life doing community service, traveling to promote racial harmony and supporting young people in seeking higher education,"" the foundation said. In 1999, he and the others received a Congressional Gold Medal from President Bill Clinton. Thomas' oldest sister, Alma Hildreth, told CNN she believes God protected Thomas so that he could accomplish a mission that God had given him: ""To stand up and do what he thought was right, [and to show] that education belonged to him and all the children."" ""He did a lot of good that he really enjoyed doing and wanted to do. He did a lot of speaking and encouraging young people to reach for the stars. That was his mission, to do that,"" Hildreth said. President Barack Obama expressed his condolences to Thomas' family in a statement issued Monday, and praised Thomas' bravery in entering Central High School. ""Mr. Thomas was just a teenager when he became one of the first African-American students to enroll in Little Rock Central High School.  Yet even at such a young age, he had the courage to risk his own safety, to defy a governor and a mob, and to walk proudly into that school even though it would have been far easier to give up and turn back,"" the Obama statement said. Obama said the action ""helped open the doors of opportunity for their generation and for those that followed."" The surviving members of the Little Rock Nine ""expressed their heartfelt sadness at the passing of the man they called their brother in a unique group for the past 53 years,"" the foundation's statement said. The nine have remained close, and through their foundation they provided college scholarships and mentoring to students. ""I will miss his calculated sense of humor,"" said LaNier, another member of the nine. ""He had a way of asking a question and ending it with a joke, probably to ease the pain during our teenage years at Central. He was a Christian who sincerely promoted racial harmony and took his responsibilities seriously."" ""Jefferson has always been, to us, a brother,"" said Melba Pattillo Beals, another one of the nine. ""He's funny and very strong, like when we would have a very difficult day, things were absolutely at their worst, he would say, 'Smile, you're on Candid Camera,' or, you know, 'Look at what you're wearing!' He was just really, really funny."" She said Thomas sent other members of the group funny e-mails almost until the day of his death. On September 4, 1957, a national furor erupted as the nine students attempted to enter Central High. Then-Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus, in defiance of a federal court order desegregating schools, called out the Arkansas National Guard to prevent them from entering. ""The nine students, chosen by Little Rock school system administrators for their excellent grades and records of good behavior, were stunned by the presence of hundreds of rioting segregationists and the Arkansas National Guard, the foundation said. The group was turned away. For two weeks, the group remained at home, attempting to keep up with their schoolwork. The federal court ordered Faubus to stop interfering with the court order, so he removed the guardsmen from the front of the school. On September 23, the nine entered the school for the first time, but an angry crowd outside beat African-American reporters who were covering the events, according to the encyclopedia. Little Rock police, who feared they could not control the mob, pulled the nine from the school that day, and they returned home. President Dwight D. Eisenhower then mobilized the Army's 101st Airborne Division to escort the nine into the school, calling the mob's actions ""disgraceful,"" according to the encyclopedia. The nine entered on September 25. The military presence remained for the entire school year, according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture. However, the harassment did not end after the nine integrated the school. Military guards were assigned to escort the nine students to classes, according to the encyclopedia, but could not go everywhere, and name-calling, kicking and shoving continued in restrooms and locker rooms. ""I do remember [the family] got a call that he had been knocked out -- someone had hit him on the back of head while he was at a locker in hallway,"" said Jessie Agee, another sister of Thomas'. ""But he wanted to continue on with it."" When it was time to leave school, he'd run home, and one of his older brothers -- armed with a tire iron -- would wait around a corner to escort him the rest of the way, Agee said. The following year, Faubus closed all the Little Rock high schools to avoid integration, the foundation said. When the high schools reopened for the 1959-60 school year, Thomas and LaNier returned to Central High and graduated in May 1960. ""We're very sad,"" Minnijean Brown Trickey, also a member of the nine, told CNN Monday. ""We were friends before the Little Rock Central crisis, and we've been very close over the years, so it's a great tragedy for us."" Thomas was a track athlete at the African-American Dunbar Junior High School in Little Rock when he volunteered to attend Central High as a sophomore, according to his biography on the Little Rock Nine Foundation website. Hildreth said one of the reasons Thomas was inspired to volunteer came to him in biology class. At his old school, the class and the teacher had to share one frog when it came time to dissecting an animal. ""But he heard at Central, all the students had their own frog to dissect. And he said he wanted to go to Central High because he would be in a class where each student had their own frog,"" Hildreth recalled. ""We would laugh about it [later]. He said, 'I just want my own frog.'"" ""He found out about the wonderful education they were getting there, and that's what he wanted to experience,"" Hildreth said. Agee told CNN that everyone in their family, except their mother, thought Thomas' attempt to go to Central was a good idea. ""She wasn't too keen on it, but she went along with it. His father wanted him to do it. She finally gave in. Him being the youngest, she was very protective of him. And he managed to do it,"" Agee said. After graduating from Central, he entered Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, but joined his family after they relocated to Los Angeles in 1961. He attended Los Angeles State College, where he was a member of the student government and president of the Associated Engineers. He was inducted into the Army in 1966, and was assigned to duty in south Vietnam with the 9th Infantry Division, the biography said. ""He served as an infantry squad leader and directed numerous field campaigns as they confronted enemy troops."" He returned to civilian life in 1968, where he helped his father run the family business and obtained his bachelor's degree from Los Angeles State College. He went to work as an accounting clerk and later a supervisor for Mobil Oil Corporation's Los Angeles Credit Card Center, while still working with the family business. When Mobile moved its operations to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1978, Thomas chose to stay in Los Angeles and went to work for the Defense Department. When the department relocated some of its Los Angeles operations in 1989, he sold the family business and moved to Columbus. In Columbus, he was active in education and community service. He received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Ohio Dominican University ""in recognition of his life-long efforts in human rights and equality,"" the biography said. Thomas was a recipient of the NAACP's Springarn Medal. ""Date and time are pending for a celebration of Thomas' life in Columbus, Ohio, and Los Angeles, California,"" the foundation said. Thomas is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Jefferson Thomas Jr.; and two stepchildren, identified as Frank and Marilyn by the foundation. ""We volunteered to go to Central, not anticipating the opposition that we would face,"" Trickey told CNN. It was only after Eisenhower sent in the 1,200 troops that the group was able to enter, she said. ""We stay in contact because we had that experience, and we grew up together in Little Rock,"" she said. ""... we cared so much about each other and felt that, that common experience bonded us in an amazing way."" In 1999, the group formed the Little Rock Nine Foundation, which according to its website aims ""to promote the ideals of justice and equality of opportunity for all.""

"(CNN) -- Italy beat England 4-2 in a penalty shootout to reach the semifinals of Euro 2012 after their match in Kiev Sunday ended goalless following extra time. Alessandro Diamanti converted the deciding penalty to give Italy a deserved victory after they had dominated for prolonged periods. They will play Germany for a place in the final in Warsaw Thursday. Portugal play defending champions Spain in the first semifinal in Donetsk Wednesday. The Italians were first to miss in the shootout when Riccardo Montolivo shot wide, but England's delight was short-lived when Ashley Young's well-struck spot-kick rattled the crossbar. Man of the match Andrea Pirlo then pulled Italy level at 2-2 with an impudent chip over Joe Hart, before Ashley Cole saw his effort saved by Gianluigi Buffon. Soccer Live: CNN's live blog of England vs Italy . Diamanti supplied the winning touch, prompting his teammates to charge forward in celebration as England were once again left to rue their failure to win a penalty shootout at a major competition. ""We've gone out without being beaten with our heads held high and making the country proud,"" a defiant England manager Roy Hodgson told reporters after their defeat. Cesare Prandelli's Italy had the better of the opening exchanges in regulation time, with Daniele de Rossi almost giving the Azzurri the lead after two minutes when his swerving volley hit the woodwork. England also went close when Buffon was forced to claw away a Glen Johnson effort. Manchester City's mercurial talent Mario Balotelli was a constant threat to England and saw a close range effort blocked by Hart, before Wayne Rooney set up his Manchester United teammate Danny Welbeck, only to see him to fire over from a good position. Italy ended the half the stronger team -- Antonio Cassano had a snap shot parried by Hart, while Balotelli ballooned over from close range. The pattern continued after the break with de Rossi guilty of a bad miss after Hart could only push out a Cassano corner. Balotelli, who might by that point have scored a hat-trick, was again frustrated with a volleyed effort, which Hart saved with his legs -- Montolivo then shot over the bar from the rebound. There was further frustration in the closing moments when Pirlo found space in the England box, but his goal-bound volley was blocked by Johnson. And into injury time, substitute Andy Carroll headed back for Rooney to scissor kick over in a rare England attack. In extra time, Diamanti saw his intended cross deceive Hart and hit the outside of the post, as the Italians continued to dominate possession. Italy thought they had won it in the dying minutes of the second period when Antonio Nocerino headed in Diamanti's dangerous cross, but he was ruled to be offside.","Italy beat England in a penalty shootout to reach Euro 2012 semifinals .

"New York (CNN) -- A flag that accompanied Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and his 7th Cavalry into their final battle 134 years ago will be put up for auction, the auction house that will handle the sale said Friday. Custer led more than 200 other other soldiers into battle against thousands of Lakota and Northern Cheyenne warriors on June 25, 1876, at the Little Bighorn River in what is now Montana. None of the U.S. soldiers survived the battle. The flag that will be sold in October is tattered and fragile, measures 27½ by 33 inches and may be stained with blood. It was found three days after the Battle of Little Bighorn -- or the Battle of Greasy Grass Creek, as the victors called it -- beneath the body of one of Custer's men killed in the battle. Sgt. Ferdinand Culbertson, a member of the burial detail assigned to retrieve the remains of the 7th Cavalry, found the Cavalry guidon, or swallow-tail flag, that was used by cavalry companies. The design reduced wind drag as the soldiers advanced. ""It's not a piece of decoration,"" said Sotheby's vice chairman, David Redden. ""It's a sacred relic. People died for this flag. This flag is really important as it symbolizes one of the great and mythological battles in American history."" Another flag from the battle site was found months later in an Indian village seized by U.S. troops and is now owned by the National Park Service, but Redden said it is in very poor condition. Custer's last battle was part of the United States government's 1876-77 campaign to retake the Black Hills region, ceded in perpetuity by an 1868 treaty to the Lakota. But when gold was discovered in the area, the army was sent to push the aboriginal Americans to a reservation set up for them. The 7th Cavalry surprised the Lakota and Cheyenne, camped on the river banks, but Custer vastly underestimated their number and was crushed. Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse were among the Lakota leaders who took part in the battle. The Detroit Institute for the Arts acquired the flag in 1895 for $54 but has decided to part with it and use the proceeds for future art acquisitions. The Institute's director, Graham Beal, says the flag won't be missed as it was often on loan to other institutions, most recently at the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument in Montana. ""The sale will help with future acquisitions,"" said Beal. ""With the proceeds we will get art for the collection. Even though we are in Detroit, we have one of the great universal collections including Baroque, African and early modern collections. We are right up there with Chicago, Cleveland and Philadelphia. Author Nathaniel Philbrick, whose book ""The Last Stand: Custer, Sitting Bull and the Battle of the Little Big Horn"" was released in May, said the significance of shabby flag is enormous. ""It's not only symbolic, but it's also just a terrific artifact,"" he said. ""It's pretty intact and given what it went through, it's amazing."" John Doerner, chief historian at the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, said he believes the flag is stained with the blood of a fallen soldier and that the banner belongs to the American people. ""It was an act of courage and bravery,"" said Doerner, a 20-year veteran of the National Parks Service. ""To lose the colors was really something that a soldier would give their lives [to prevent],"" he said. Doerner is helping oversee events for the battle's anniversary this weekend at the national monument, where visitors will hear symposiums and view re-enactments. He is hopeful that a benefactor will purchase the flag and loan it to a national museum. Redden said expectations are good that the Custer flag sale price might exceed Sotheby's $2 million to $5 million estimate, but the hope is that the sale will come close to the $12.3 million paid for a Revolutionary Battle flag in 2006, a record for any military relic at auction.","Lakota, Northern Cheyenne warriors crushed Custer's 7th Cavalry .

"Ventersdorp, South Africa (CNN)  -- Blacks and whites confronted each other Tuesday outside a courthouse where two people accused of killing a white supremacist leader in South Africa appeared and were charged with murder. The two groups outside the courthouse in Ventersdorp sang rival national anthems, with whites singing ""Die Stem van Suid-Afrika,"" an apartheid-era national anthem, while blacks sang ""Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika,"" which was sung as an act of defiance during the apartheid years. The songs were combined to create the country's current national anthem, according to the government's Web site. Analysis: Terreblanche's death stokes racial tensions . The two suspects, ages 15 and 28, were formally charged Tuesday with murder in the killing of Eugene Terreblanche. They also were charged with housebreaking, robbery, attempted robbery and crimen injuria, a count specific to South Africa in which someone deliberately injures another person's dignity. Prosecutors said the count of crimen injuria related to the two suspects allegedly leaving Terreblanche's body with the pants pulled down. The suspects, whom authorities have not identified, are accused of killing Terreblanche in a dispute over wages. Terreblanche, 69, was bludgeoned with clubs and stabbed with a machete during the attack at his farm near Ventersdorp in South Africa's North West province, police said. A new hearing has been set for April 14. Outside the court, blacks and whites faced off in a brief scuffle apparently sparked by a white woman who threw a bottle at the black group. Police erected barbed wire to separate the groups; the wire already surrounded the courthouse to prevent the crowds from swarming the building. Riot police stood between the wire and about 200 of Terreblanche's followers -- some of whom were wearing army uniforms with swastika-like emblems on caps and shirts. ""We are here to show our solidarity with Terreblanche,"" said Pieter Steyn, a spokesman for the supremacist's neo-Nazi group Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, also called AWB. ""The situation in this country is volatile,"" he said. Some protesters carried signs, including one that read, ""We are fed up with the new South Africa."" Another sign said, ""Soccer 2010, 65 days to chaos,"" an apparent reference to the start of the World Cup in the country. A few blacks watched nervously. ""These people are hurting. Their leader has been killed, and we don't know what they will do to us,"" one bystander said. The AWB retracted its vow Monday to avenge the killing of its leader. ""The statement was made by an emotional member of our organization,"" Steyn said. ""The person has been reprimanded. We want a homeland where we can govern ourselves, and violence is not going to do our cause any good."" The AWB has blamed the killing on the singing of a controversial African National Congress song, ""Shoot the Farmer."" Julius Malema, the ruling party's youth leader, had sung the apartheid-era song in recent weeks until a court barred him from doing so. Steyn urged South African President Jacob Zuma to intervene. ""We are finding it difficult to keep our members calm under the current circumstances. If farm murders continue, we cannot guarantee that our members will continue refraining from retaliating,"" Steyn said. Zuma has appealed for peace. ""I call upon our people, black and white, to remain calm, and allow police and other organs of state to do their work,"" Zuma said in a Sunday statement. The AWB is best known for trying to block South Africa's effort to end apartheid. The group used terrorist tactics in a bid to stall the country's first all-race vote in 1994, killing more than 20 people in a wave of bombings on the eve of the elections. Terreblanche was convicted of a 1996 attempted murder of a black man who worked as a security guard on his farm. He served about two-thirds of a five-year sentence. He was also convicted of setting his dog on a black man in an earlier incident .","Groups of blacks, whites sang rival anthems outside court .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A North Korean torpedo attack was the most likely cause for the sinking of a South Korean warship last month, according to a US military official. The US believes the ship was sunk by the blast of an underwater explosion, but that the explosive device itself did not come in contact with the hull of the South Korean ship, the official said. This is the same conclusion expressed by South Korean military officials.","U.S. official: North Korean torpedo probably sank S. Korean ship .

"(CNN) -- Fears of an imminent terrorist attack in Yemen caused the United States to order some Americans to leave the country on Tuesday, while Britain pulled out its embassy staff amid continuing strife. A pair of suspected U.S. drone strikes killed four al Qaeda militants, and a bomb tossed into a mosque west of the capital, Sanaa, killed one person and injured 12, police told the state news agency SABA. The U.S. security posture throughout the Middle East, and especially in Yemen, was heightened this week after officials intercepted a message from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to a top ally in Yemen telling him to ""do something."" According to sources, the message was sent to Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who U.S. intelligence believes was recently appointed the overall terror organization's No. 2 leader. A convergence of developments -- the intercept and increased intelligence ""chatter"" indicating final planning for an attack; a series of prison breaks linked to al Qaeda that freed hundreds of convicted or suspected terrorists in Iraq, Libya and Pakistan; and the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan -- caused U.S. officials to issue a worldwide travel alert and close embassies and consulates this week across Africa and the Middle East. Tuesday's withdrawal of non-emergency government personnel further escalated the security precautions. ""In response to a request from the U.S. State Department, early this morning the U.S. Air Force transported personnel out of Sanaa, Yemen,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said in a statement. CNN's Barbara Starr was told that two military planes carrying as many as 90 Americans from Yemen were enroute to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. At the State Department, spokesperson Jen Psaki said Tuesday that ordering out non-emergency personnel was in response to a ""specific, immediate"" threat that also caused other precautionary steps such as the extended closing of diplomatic facilities announced Sunday. The British Foreign Office also announced Tuesday that ""all staff in the British Embassy"" in Yemen had been ""temporarily withdrawn and the embassy will remain closed until staff are able to return."" It cited ""increased security concerns"" for the move. In Washington, the Yemeni Embassy issued a statement criticizing the foreign withdrawals. ""Yemen has taken all necessary precautions to ensure the safety and security of foreign missions in the capital,"" said the statement by Yemen's foreign affairs ministry. ""While the government of Yemen appreciates foreign governments' concern for the safety of their citizens, the evacuation of embassy staff serves the interests of the extremists and undermines the exceptional cooperation between Yemen and the international alliance against terrorism."" Psaki, however, said the decision to pull out non-emergency personnel ""doesn't have an impact"" on the broader U.S. relationship with the Yemeni government, noting that Secretary of State John Kerry spoke Monday night with Yemen's president ""to thank him for his efforts around this announcement."" Security sources who told CNN about the latest drone strikes provided no additional details. A Yemeni official said four drone strikes have been carried out in the past 10 days. None of those killed in the two strikes on Tuesday were among the 25 names on the country's most-wanted list, security officials said. Separately, American special forces units overseas have been on alert for the past several days awaiting a mission to attack potential al Qaeda targets if those behind the most recent terror threats against U.S. interests can be identified, a senior Obama administration official told CNN. The official declined to identify the units or their locations because of the sensitive nature of the information. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel put the units on alert last week, the official said. According to the White House and State Department, the substantial security steps reflect an ""abundance of caution"" over intelligence information that indicated final planning by al Qaeda in Yemen for possible terrorist attacks on Western targets to coincide with the end of Ramadan. On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that U.S. anti-terrorism efforts had decimated al Qaeda's global leadership and greatly diminished its core in Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying the threat had ""shifted to some of these affiliates, in particular AQAP."" 'Do something' The intercepted message among senior al Qaeda operatives over the past several days further intensified concerns already heightened by increased terrorist chatter detected by intelligence agencies, as well as the prison breaks. U.S. and Yemeni officials had already spent weeks watching a rising stream of intelligence about the possibility of a major terrorist attack in Yemen, so the message from al-Zawahiri to the AQAP leader caused them to fear imminent terrorist action. Along with the intercepted message, U.S. officials cautioned there may be multiple sources of intelligence, including intercepts of electronic information from phone calls and web postings and the interrogation of couriers or other operatives. Opinion: What's behind timing of terror threat . Asked Monday about the prison breaks, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf called them ""a concern for the international community"" that is ""separate and apart"" from the U.S. concern about the latest specific terrorist threat. CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen, however, noted that al Qaeda ""actually announced a year ago that they were going to do this campaign of releasing prisoners from prison and they conducted something like seven prison assaults -- a couple of which have been quite successful."" Prison breaks . A senior official with Iraq's interior ministry told CNN on condition of not being identified that top officials of al Qaeda in Iraq, including Adnan Ismail Najim Abdullah al-Dulaimi, escaped from Abu Ghraib prison during the jailbreak there last month and remains at large. Bergen noted that a 2006 prison break in Sanaa led to the creation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the terrorist organization's most virulent affiliates. Although the prison breaks are not the main reason for the raised terror threat, said CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank, ""it is part of the background music."" Prison breaks can often strengthen terrorist groups because ""some of these guys are likely to be seasoned operatives,"" he added. To CNN National Security Contributor Frances Fragos Townsend, the timing of the prison breaks and increased intelligence chatter building up to the end of Ramadan signaled heightened al Qaeda activity that required precautionary steps in response. She noted that in the run-up to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, ""the government failed to connect dots."" ""These seem like dots that ought to be connected,"" said Townsend, a former homeland security and anti-terrorism adviser to the Bush administration. ""You can figure out later whether or not you were right."" Is rash of brazen prison breaks related? Interpol wants to know . Another dot she cited was that al-Zawahiri recently appointed Wuhayshi to be the new general manager of the global al Qaeda network. A high-profile attack orchestrated by Wuhayshi would cement the Yemeni's new position in the al Qaeda hierarchy, Townsend said. According to a U.S. official with access to the latest intelligence, Wuhayshi's appointment as a top global al Qaeda figure would almost certainly have required back-and-forth communication between AQAP and al Qaeda central. Over the weekend, Interpol warned that al Qaeda has been tied to the prison breaks on July 23 in Iraq, on July 26 in Libya and four days later in Pakistan. End of Ramadan . Another factor prompting the embassy and consulate closures is the end of Ramadan. Depending on when a new crescent moon is seen, the Muslim holy month could end Wednesday or Thursday. Ramadan's end is celebrated with the Eid al-Fitr festivities -- a three-day holiday in most Muslim countries. The State Department, in announcing its embassy and consulate closures, said ""a number of our embassies and consulates were going to be closed in accordance with local custom and practice for the bulk of the week for the Eid celebration at the end of Ramadan."" Strategic reason . Townsend said there could be a strategic reason for shutting down the diplomatic offices. ""Once you take targets away, it buys you additional time to try and disrupt, to identify the cell, the operators in country and the region, and work with your partners in the region to try and ... get them in custody or disrupt the plot,"" she said. ""So, some of this operationally is about buying time."" List of closures . A total of 19 U.S. embassies and consulates will be closed Monday through Saturday. The following 15 were part of the original list of 20 diplomatic facilities closed Sunday: . U.S. Embassy Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates . U.S. Embassy Amman, Jordan . U.S. Embassy Cairo, Egypt . U.S. Consulate Dhahran, Saudi Arabia . U.S. Embassy Djibouti, Djibouti . U.S. Embassy Doha, Qatar . U.S. Consulate Dubai, United Arab Emirates . U.S. Consulate Jeddah, Saudi Arabia .

"(CNN) -- In less than a week, Turkey will hold its first direct presidential election, yet the mood about the country can hardly be described as electric. This is strange given the usual excitement around elections in Turkey, the historic importance of this poll, and the exceptionally high level of socio-political tensions in recent years. Besides the summer heat and the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, the relative lull might be explained by the widespread anticipation that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, candidate of the ruling AKP, will emerge triumphant from the ballot box, in either the first or the second round. Erdogan understands power and pursues it like no other politician in Turkey's modern history. He has a tightening grip over all key state institutions, save perhaps the Constitutional Court. He also has a deeply emotional relationship with his followers, who rally around their leader more passionately as he faces stiffer opposition to his increasingly personal rule. This is how he has survived massive anti-government protests, a damaging feud with former Islamist allies and a high profile corruption scandal, an appallingly mismanaged industrial disaster and successive foreign policy debacles -- latest being the abduction of 49 Turkish diplomats and consulate workers in Mosul by ISIS militants, whose rise some critics attribute in part to the AKP government's open border policy for jihadis fighting in Syria -- all in the space of a year. This might also explain the somber mood around many of his opponents, who seem to believe that having come so close to realizing his long standing ambition of becoming Turkey's first popularly elected president, Erdogan will not let the opportunity slip. But the lull should not overshadow the critical importance of the election. To be sure, an Erdogan victory would amount to no less than regime change for Turkey. It would mark the most crucial step yet in its decade-long transformation from an imperfect parliamentary democracy under military tutelage towards a ""plebiscitarian democracy"" -- characterized by a powerful executive, a weak or compliant legislative, and a charismatic leader-follower relationship that is periodically reaffirmed in general elections and referenda. One would be mistaken to think of the presidency, under Turkey's existing parliamentary system, as a ceremonial post that would deprive its occupant of the executive powers of a prime minister. Turkey has had ambitious presidents, such as Turgut Ozal (1989 -- 1993) and Ahmet Necdet Sezer (2000 -- 2007), whose influence was checked by hostile lawmakers or meddlesome generals. A President Erdogan wouldn't face these obstacles: his party controls the parliament and the military has been tamed through EU-backed reforms and two highly politicized court cases. The current constitution, drawn up by the military junta in 1982, gives the head of state significant authorities, which Erdogan would push to the limit by invoking the ""national will"" he claims to embody; a claim that would be further reinforced and personalized in the event of his election. Where would this scenario leave those who feel increasingly alienated, stifled and marginalized in Erdogan's new Turkey? Another electoral loss would be sure to further dispirit those who hoped to see some change to the political status quo after the Gezi protests of last summer. But in defeat, there might be a valuable and necessary lesson. The two main opposition parties -- the secular republican CHP and the nationalist MHP -- have formed an informal coalition for the sole purpose of posing a numerical challenge to the AKP's relative majority, with anti-Erdoganism being their chief unifying cause. Party leaders have handpicked candidates and determined election strategies with minimum public consultation. Only a handful of people were involved in the selection of Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, the former secretary-general of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, as the two parties' joint candidate for presidency. Predictably, this uninspiring, ultra-pragmatic, top-down tactic came short in the local elections (even when one takes into account the allegations of voting fraud, the AKP remains the clear overall winner) and risks failing in the presidential one. More importantly, this style of politics is inimical to the grassroots, democratic and pluralistic vision that the ""Gezi spirit"" has aspired to capture. Whatever the outcome of the presidential election, those who wish to see this vision transformed into reality would be better served by focusing on the long term process rather than short term gains, and on building organizational capacity at the level of local politics instead of obsessing over the control of state institutions in Ankara. Success in local politics paves the way for success in national politics, as Turkey's political Islamists have shown time and again over the past two decades. But a true democratic transformation also requires devolution of political authority. Since its foundation as a republic 91 years ago, Turkey's excessively centralized political architecture has allowed those who attain control of the state to force their will on the entire population. The machinery that repressed ethnic minorities and pious Muslims in the past is now alienating non-practicing Muslims, Alevis, LGBTI members and other social and political minority groups who do not fit in with Erdogan's vision of an overtly religious neo-liberal Turkey. Only a well-organized movement that takes its strength from local politics and stands for pluralism, decentralization and democratic rights and liberties of all citizens can break this vicious cycle of suppression and alienation.

"(CNN) -- After a fraught buildup and the razzmatazz of the opening ceremony, the real action gets underway Monday at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. Going for gold will be around 5,000 athletes from 71 countries, competing over the next 11 days in 17 sports. Eight gold medals will be awarded today; one in gymnastics, two in weightlifting and five in swimming, with English swimmer Rebecca Adlington expected to add to her Olympic gold medal won in Beijing in 2008. At the end of the competition it's the usual suspects of Australia, England and Canada that are expected to top the medal table, while hosts India are hoping to at least secure fourth place, as they have in the last two competitions in Melbourne and Manchester. India's sole gold medallist from the Beijing Olympic Games, Abhinav Bindra, who carried the flag at the opening ceremony, will also be carrying the weight of the nation's expectations of securing gold on home turf. Read more: India hope for glow after gloom . On Wednesday the fireworks and dancers from the opening ceremony at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium will give way to track and field athletes, but there will be a few notable absentees.

South Africa's 19-year-old world 800m champion Caster Semenya did not make it to the Indian capital also because of injury. The need to rest and recover after a long season has been the reason other medal favorites have given for missing the Games. Former sprint world record holder Asafa Powell, pentathlete Jessica Ennis and distance runner Mo Farah have decided against traveling to Delhi. Visit the official Commonwealth Games site . Others however won't be appearing for personal reasons. England's Olympic Triple Jump medallist in the Triple Jump announced on Twitter that he decided not to travel to the Games because of safety concerns. South African long-jumper Khotso Mokoena who won silver at the Olympic Games in Beijing was passed fit by South Africa's medical team but reportedly refused to join the team flying to the Indian capital. While some countries like Australia have hired private security companies and will be guarded by Australian federal police, an estimated 100,000 police and security personnel will be protecting the 17 competition venues as well as other Games-related sites. As well as athletics and other Olympic events, squash, lawn bowls and rugby sevens make up the sports at the Games.

"(CNN) -- All the self-righteous huffing and puffing in Washington over Ukraine jars on European and especially Russian ears after the multiple U.S.-led invasions and interventions in other people's countries of recent years. It's difficult to say what is more astonishing: the double standards exhibited by the White House, or the apparent total lack of self-awareness of U.S. officials. Secretary of State John Kerry risked utter ridicule when he declared it unacceptable to invade another country on a ""completely trumped-up pretext,"" or just because you don't like its current leadership. Iraq in 2003 springs instantly to mind. This is exactly what George W. Bush and Tony Blair did when they ""trumped up"" the supposed threat posed by the hated Saddam Hussein's fabled weapons of mass destruction. Like Saddam, the Taliban leadership in place in Afghanistan in 2001 was deeply objectionable. But instead of just going after Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda training camps after the 9/11 attacks, Bush (again abetted by Blair) opted for full-scale regime change. The lamentable consequences of that decision are still being felt 13 years later, not least by Afghan civilians who have been dying in ever greater numbers as the final Nato withdrawal approaches. U.S. President Barack Obama, a former law professor who should know better, has charged Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, with violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, in breach of international law. But it is Obama, following in Bush's footsteps, who has repeatedly and cynically flouted international law by launching or backing myriad armed attacks on foreign soil, in Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan to name a few, without U.N. security council authorization. It is Obama's administration which continues to undermine international law by refusing to join or recognize the International Criminal Court, the most important instrument of international justice to have been developed since 1945. And it is Obama's State Department, principally in the person of Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, that fatally overplayed its hand in the run-up to last month's second Ukraine revolution. Nuland's infamous ""f**k the EU"" comment revealed the extent to which Washington was recklessly maneuvering to undermine Ukraine's elected pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, by backing the Kiev street protesters' demands. The EU had wanted to take things more gradually, for fear of provoking the very Russian reaction to which the U.S. now so strongly objects. When the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland, acting for the EU, negotiated a compromise agreement on February 22 that envisaged early elections, the crisis appeared to have been defused. Russia did not like the deal, but seemed ready to go along. But within 24 hours, the opposition had torn up the agreement. It forced Yanukovych from power and sacked the government. To alarm in Moscow, where nightmarish World War II memories linger, Ukrainian neo-fascists were among those who seized control. They are now part of the new government in Kiev. The U.S. almost immediately gave its blessing to what the Kremlin later described as a ""coup d'etat"" while the EU, knowing this was what Washington wanted, just looked on. Little wonder the Russians were furious at what they saw as a western double cross. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, reflected these worries when he voiced ""most serious concern"" over Ukraine in phone calls to the French, German and Polish foreign ministers. ""The opposition not only has failed to fulfil a single one of its obligations but is already presenting new demands all the time, following the lead of armed extremists and pogromists whose actions pose a direct threat to Ukraine's sovereignty and constitutional order,'' Lavrov said. But it was already too late. Obama and Kerry seem to have calmed down a little since the crisis first broke. The self-righteous hyperbole about international rights is less evident, though it has not disappeared entirely. Obama has heard the many voices in the U.S. and beyond terming this the worst east-west crisis since the end of the Cold War -- and as the biggest foreign test of his presidency. So now he's doing what he does best: talking. In his latest phone call to Putin, on Thursday this week, Obama put forward a plan to resolve the stand-off diplomatically. It includes direct talks between Moscow and Kiev, the return of Russian troops to their bases, and the deployment of international observers to ensure the rights of all ethnic groups, including Crimean Russians, are respected. But don't hold your breath. Putin is in no hurry to back off or back down. He has his tail up after a fortnight in which he exposed the hypocrisy and hollowness of much of western policy and politicians. His behavior, especially in Crimea, has been dangerous, wrong-headed and irresponsible in the extreme. In many ways, Putin is an unredeemed Cold War throwback. He is definitely not the sort of chap one would invite round for dinner, as a former British diplomat commented. The crisis could still explode in his and everyone else's face. But it was not unprovoked. And the Russian leader has an eye for precedent. Similar battles over so-called ""frozen conflicts"" and the rights of isolated ethnic groups loom elsewhere on Russia's periphery, in Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and maybe Belarus and the Baltic states too. Putin is putting down a marker, even as he plays Obama and Kerry for fools. Whatever they think in Washington, and whatever the financial markets say, it's working for him personally. Latest opinion polls in Russia show Putin's popularity soaring. One of these days western leaders will drop the pious cant, learn to stop under-estimating him, and recognize Russia's leader-for-life as the canny, very dangerous, utterly unscrupulous opponent he is.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Flags lowered to half-staff Sunday across China and at the nation's embassies and consulates around the world to mourn the victims of deadly mudslides in northwestern Gansu provice. The mudslides killed 1,239 people and 505 are still missing, the state-run Xinhua news agency said Saturday. But residents of hard-hit Zhouqu County told CNN they believe the toll is much higher. Meanwhile, in southwestern China, already inundated by heavy downpours all summer, new rain-triggered landslides Saturday left at least 38 people missing, Xinhua said. Thousands of people and vehicles were stranded as roads become impassable in Sichuan province. The only highway linking Wenchuan County to Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan province, was submerged under 13 feet of water. About 10,000 residents have been evacuated, Xinhua said. The county government has designated schools and office buildings of township governments as temporary shelters. Students in Zhouqu will start the fall semester 10 days late because some schools were buried or suffered severe damage. Power had been restored to about 76 percent of affected homes, Xinhua said. Vegetables became available for the first time in nearly a week, the news agency reported. The Chinese government has banned public entertainment -- including movies, karaoke online videos and music -- on Sunday in remembrance of those who perished in Gansu province this week. Sunday is the seventh day since the Zhouqu mudslide and, according to some Chinese traditions, the seventh day after a death is the height of the mourning period. Large-scale national displays of mourning, however, are rare in China, though it held three days of mourning after a massive 2008 earthquake in Sichuan and a one-day mourning after a quake in Yushu earlier this year. China has been drenched by heavy rains and floods since the end of May. More than 400 million people in 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have been affected.","NEW: Death toll rises to 1,239 .

Inspired by the saying of the famous German writer, Awuah moved with his family back to Ghana. There, he invested his own money and with the help of other donors he founded Ashesi University. ""Africa needs to have a renaissance,"" says Awuah, as he explains what drove him to take the risky decision. ""The world needs to change in this way and I strongly believe that people like me who have had the privilege of a great education need to be part of the solution; that I need to be really actively involved in helping to drive this change in Africa so that 30, 50 years from now, the world will be a different place for all people of African descent in the world."" Fostering leaders . Located about an hour's drive from the capital Accra, Ashesi, which appropriately translates to ""beginning,"" is the first Ghanaian university to combine technical majors with a liberal arts approach. Its vibrant campus, set on 100 acres in a town called Berekuso, was designed to be inspiring for the more than 500 young Ghanaians studying there. Read this: Building a network of leaders . And while Ashesi has already come a long way -- when the school first opened in 2002 there was no campus, just a couple of rented buildings for its 30 students -- Awuah plans to expand his offering as part of his dream of finding and developing Africa's next problem solvers. ""In this country, only 5% of college-age kids go to college,"" he says. ""And there's two problems with that number: one is it's too small, but the second is that everyone who goes to college by definition is going to be running this country one day, the 5% -- they're going to be running the courts, they're going to be designing roads and buildings and infrastructure, they're going to be running the hospitals, the schools, the businesses. ""So when I look at universities I see Africa fast-forward 30 years. When this 20-year-old is now in his or her 50s, that person is going to be a leader. And so I felt that engaging how that leadership, that future leadership core, is educated could be catalytic."" Tough decisions . Awuah, who grew up in Accra, left Ghana in 1985 to pursue his own education in the United States. There, he got a job at Microsoft, spearheading software design for dial-up internet access, making millions in the process. He admits that quitting Microsoft was not an easy decision and credits his American wife for supporting him. ""I won't lie to you -- it was tough,"" says Awuah. ""But I can tell you that when I mentioned this idea to my wife, she immediately agreed,"" he adds. ""She'd never been to Africa before she met me and part of her conviction that this sounded like a good idea and her willingness to go ahead with it was very encouraging."" Read this: South Africa's outspoken educator . Committed to providing greater education opportunities in Ghana, he went back to school himself, earning a Master's degree at Berkeley, one of the world's top business schools. For his efforts, he's won many awards. Changing the continent . Today Ashesi, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, offers degrees in business, information systems and computer science, with plans to offer engineering and economics majors in the near future. Its graduation rate is between 70 and 90%, according to Awuah. Total fees costs $9,000 a year, including tuition, housing and meals. Awuah says the university brings together a diverse mix of students from different backgrounds, including scholarship-winning undergraduates from humble beginnings who are the first in their families to attend college. Read this: Young innovators can change how world sees Africa . ""Our last freshman class, 50% of that class paid full tuition, 25% were on full scholarships and 25% on partial scholarships,"" he says.""The reason why diversity's so important is that the most important conversation on campus is a conversation about the good society -- what is the good society we would like to see in Africa?' That conversation is a lot more interesting if you have diversity in the classroom,"" adds Awuah. ""Because each person has an important perspective to share, but each person also has certain blinders that need to be peeled away -- that can be peeled away if they're in a room with others who have other perspectives as they do."" Looking ahead, Awuah says he hopes Africa's universities will cultivate a new generation of bold and innovative leaders, helping the continent to transform itself. ""If you come back in 30 years, universities will be competing for the best and brightest students,"" he says. ""I hope that universities will also be competing on things such as whose students are the most ethical,"" he adds."" If that happens, it will change the continent.""","Patrick Awuah is the founder of Ashesi University in Ghana .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- On the same day yet another death was reported in China's bird flu outbreak, the World Health Organization warned the H7N9 virus was one of the most lethal that doctors and medical investigators had faced in recent years. ""This is an unusually dangerous virus for humans,"" Keiji Fukuda, WHO's assistant director-general for health, security and the environment told a news conference in Beijing Wednesday. ""We think this virus is more easily transmitted from poultry to humans than H5N1,"" he added, referring to the bird flu outbreak between 2004 and 2007 that claimed 332 lives. ""This is definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses that we have seen so far."" As investigations continue into the possible sources of infection, Fukuda warned that authorities were still struggling to understand the virus. The WHO said China must brace for continued infections. Fukuda's warning came as Taiwanese health authorities said they've confirmed the first human case of H7N9 in Taiwan -- one they said was imported from China. A 53-year-old Taiwanese man who worked in eastern China was confirmed to have H7N9 on Wednesday, the Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control said. His condition was described to be severe. He had been traveling back and forth regularly between China's Jingsu province and Taiwan, health officials said. ""According to the case, he had not been exposed to birds and poultry during his stay in Suzhou (in Jingsu province) and had not consumed undercooked poultry or eggs,"" the Taiwanese CDC said. Taiwanese health officials said they are screening travelers arriving from China for signs of H7N9. Fukuda, meanwhile, said WHO officials ""are at the beginning of our understanding of this virus."" ""(The situation remains) complex, difficult and it is evolving,"" he said. So far there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, the authorities say. ""We do want to note, however, that if limited person-to-person transmission is demonstrated in the future, this really will not be surprising,"" Fukuda warned, adding that it was critical to remain vigilant, monitoring the virus's spread and mutation. ""We are not sure that the clusters were caused by common exposure to a source of the virus or were due to limited person-to-person transmission,"" he said. ""Moreover we have not seen sustained person-to-person transmission."" While some elements of the outbreak have baffled investigators -- specifically why the virus tends to target an elderly demographic and the fact that it is asymptomatic or mild in some cases and lethal in others -- authorities have claimed some significant victories in the fight against a pandemic. Anne Kelso, the director of a WHO-collaborating research center, said researchers had seen a ""dramatic slowdown"" in human cases in Shanghai after the city's live poultry market was shut on April 6. Describing the finding as ""very encouraging,"" she said evidence suggests the closure of live poultry markets is an effective way to stop the spread of the virus. The joint inspection team from China's National Health and Family Planning Commission and the World Health Organization also found that, so far, no migratory birds have tested positive for the virus, taking another worrying route of transmission out of the equation. It said the H7N9 virus is only being found in chickens, ducks and pigeons at live poultry markets. WHO officials said there are already efforts underway in other countries to develop a vaccine after Chinese officials admitted international help would be needed with this. Meanwhile, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said in its daily update on H7N9 cases that a total of 109 H7N9 cases have been reported within mainland China, including 23 deaths. Most cases have been confined to Shanghai and neighboring provinces in eastern China. CNN's Ivan Watson and Feng Ke in Beijing contributed to this report.","NEW: First H7N9 bird flu case in Taiwan has been reported, health officials say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Recreational boating accident deaths are on the rise, the U.S. Coast Guard's Office of Auxiliary and Boating Safety announced in its 2009 Recreational Boating Statistics report Tuesday. The report states that deaths caused by recreational boating accidents have increased by 3.8 percent, with related injuries increasing by 0.8 percent, though the number of accidents actually decreased by 1.2 percent. A total of 4,730 accidents recorded by the Coast Guard in 2009 caused 736 deaths, over 3,300 injuries and about $36 million in property damage, according to the report. A number called the fatality rate, which compares the number of annual deaths against the number of registered boats, increased to 5.8 deaths per 100,000 registered boats in 2009. The top five contributing factors to the accidents included boat operator inattention and inexperience, excessive speed, improper lookout and alcohol consumption. The report states that alcohol consumption ""continues to be of major concern"" in fatal accidents, and was the leading factor in 16 percent of deaths. In addition, a full 86 percent of boat operators involved in fatal accidents had not received boat safety instruction. ""Nearly 75 percent of the 736 people who died in boating accidents in 2009 drowned, and 84 percent of those victims reportedly were not wearing a life jacket,"" said Rear Adm. Kevin Cook, the Coast Guard's director of prevention policy. ""The two most important things boaters can do to prevent the loss of life is to wear a life jacket and take a boater education course.""","Fatal accidents for recreational boaters increased by 3.8 percent in 2009 .

"Brattleboro, Vermont (CNN) -- Floodwaters brought by Tropical Storm Irene began to recede Monday in parts of Vermont, but the governor warned that further flooding and loss of life are likely ahead for the small, rural state. ""It's just devastating,"" Gov. Peter Shumlin said Monday. ""Whole communities under water, businesses, homes, obviously roads and bridges, rail transportation infrastructure. We've lost farmers' crops,"" he said. ""We're tough folks up here but Irene ... really hit us hard."" Hundreds of people remained trapped Monday in communities cut off by raging floodwaters that washed out or otherwise damaged 263 roads and bridges, Shumlin said. Exactly how many were stranded remained unclear, he said. ""It's hard for us to know, frankly, because it's hard for us to get into the communities we need to get to,"" he said. Highlighting the transportation problems, the Vermont National Guard had to travel through neighboring Massachusetts to get rescue crews to the small, cut-off town of Wilmington, the governor said. Three deaths had been confirmed as a result of the storm. A woman who was standing near the Deerfield River in Wilmington died after she was swept away by floodwaters. Her body was recovered, according to authorities. Also, a male was killed in Mendon after being swept away by floodwaters, according to Vermont Emergency Management. Another male was found dead in Lake Rescue in Ludlow earlier Monday, authorities said. Shumlin said Monday afternoon that authorities were searching for another missing person. Images of the flooding showed normally tranquil streams pouring through city streets and thrashing against buildings and bridges, including some of the state's iconic covered bridges. Four to six of the covered bridges were destroyed in the flooding, officials said. Even the state emergency management headquarters in Waterbury flooded Sunday night, forcing officials to evacuate to Burlington, about 20 miles away. ""The storm essentially shut southern Vermont down,"" said state police Capt. Ray Keefe. ""It's terrible."" President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration for the state on Monday, allowing federal aid to the state. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate planned to tour flooded communities in Vermont on Tuesday, according to the Department of Homeland Security. No specifics of Fugate's trip were given. The governor described conditions as ""probably the toughest flooding that we've seen in the state of Vermont in our history."" ""You've got to remember that Vermont is a lot of beautiful mountains with valleys and small brooks that run into bigger  rivers,"" Shumlin said on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" ""Our small brooks have crested (but) our larger rivers have not -- so we know there's more trouble ahead."" Ashley Grote lives in South Royalton, Vermont, along the White River. Her home is on a hill, so the only damages she suffered were a washed-out driveway and a ""small river running through our backyard."" But many others in the area were not so fortunate, Grote said Monday after taking a walking tour of the area. She saw washed-out roads, farm fields covered in silt and other damage. She said she knows some houses were swept away, as well. ""The massive amounts of damage caused by water is so unbelievable, and until you see it you would not believe it,"" she said. ""There are so many farmers whose fields are beyond repair, and are losing food for their animals or hay that they sell for an income."" Many areas of the state remained under flood warnings Monday, with the National Weather Service reporting continued record flooding in some locations. For instance, Otter Creek in Rutland, Vermont, went from a depth of less than 4 feet Sunday morning to more than 17 feet at 1:45 a.m. Monday -- nearly 4 feet higher than the record set in 1938, according to the National Weather Service. While it was falling Monday morning, it was still 8 feet above flood stage. Shumlin said additional flooding problems were likely as water poured out of smaller streams into larger rivers. CNN iReporter Andrew Cliver had been through a hurricane before, but he said Vermont's mountainous terrain amplified the effects of Irene's rains. ""Because it's so mountainous here, the water all drains into these little creeks and rivers with a rushing force that's powerful enough to move buildings that have been standing for 100 years,"" he said. Unlike many states, Vermont did not order or suggest evacuations. Many of the state's towns are in lowlands and there are few large areas of dry land, so large-scale evacuations are impractical, Shumlin said. Some towns did partially evacuate overnight, including the state capital of Montpelier, but the situation in the town of 8,000 located 50 miles from Canada was not as bad as feared, officials said. Floodwaters appeared to peak on the Winooski River early Monday. ""There does not appear to be much additional flooding from what has been previously reported,"" said City Manager William J. Fraser. ""Overall we do not expect conditions to get worse."" In Brattleboro, a city of 12,000 people on the New Hampshire border, Whetstone Brook flowed out of its banks and undermined a three-story building, threatening to bring it down. ""We've seen nothing like this,"" said Barbara Sondag, town manager for  Brattleboro. Lifelong resident Jesse Stone watched the White River rip away at the footings of the historic Quechee covered bridge as it washed through the heart of the town. ""It is just about impossible to imagine this bridge being taken out,"" Stone said in an iReport. ""It's usually (far) above the water level."" CNN's Greg Botelho, Phil Gast, Divina Mims, Ed Payne and Justine Redman contributed to this report.","Three dead in Vermont, rescuers search for another missing person .

"(CNN) -- We may finally be able to put this whole ""twerking"" thing to rest. Though it's been around for years, it wasn't firmly a part of the Zeitgeist until Miley Cyrus unleashed it upon the world. So we can probably thank Cyrus for a video of 68-year-old Helen Mirren twerking. Yes, you read that right. Dame Helen Mirren, Oscar winner, star of stage and screen and one of the most venerable actresses of our time, apparently doesn't mind dropping it like it's hot. On Thursday, Mirren was honored at Harvard University with the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year award. The Hasty Pudding group is the oldest undergraduate drama troupe in the U.S. Every year, it salutes -- and mocks -- performers who have made a lasting and impressive contribution to the entertainment industry. During the ceremonies to honor her, Mirren was presented with the task of twerking, and so she did. She later admitted that it was not her first twerk. ""I've tried in my bedroom in private in front of the mirror, very unsuccessfully,"" she said. ""Absolutely humiliating to have to do it in public in front of a whole load of people.""

"(CNN) -- If one legendary basketball superstar on the cover of your video game is great, what about three? 2K Sports announced Thursday that the cover art of their upcoming NBA simulation game, ""NBA 2K12,"" will feature not just the return of Michael Jordan but also covers featuring 1980s greats Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. Each athlete will be shown separately on three distinct covers of the video game packaging. The artwork of each athlete was created for 2K Sports by artist Adam Larson. Larson's sports work has been highlighted in a cover of ESPN Magazine, featured in art galleries and won numerous awards. Jason Argent, vice president of marketing for 2K Sports, said after the huge success of Jordan on the cover for ""NBA 2K11,"" the company signed His Airness to a multiyear partnership. But he said the company wanted to give fans more than just a repeat. ""We are constantly focused on breaking the mold, not falling into any sort of pattern,"" he said. ""We wanted to make a big statement and a big departure and continue to evolve and grow this franchise, which has been such a great level of success for us."" Argent said the three covers for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions will be shipped in equal numbers to each retail location in the U.S. He said all other platform versions and non-U.S. locations will only get the Jordan cover. ""The idea was to keep doing things bigger and better and continue to shake things up."" Argent said he thought the multicover approach was a first in the sports video game genre and extends the strong legacy established by ""NBA 2K11."" Last year's game sold more than 5 million units worldwide and won 14 Sports Game of the Year honors. He said they weren't ready to release gameplay details at this time, but the philosophy and success of the Jordan Challenge in ""NBA 2K11"" would be continued and expanded in the new version.

"(CNN) -- Prince William has arrived in the Falkland Islands for a routine deployment as part of a four-man search and rescue crew, Britain's Ministry of Defence said Thursday. The prince will begin his Royal Air Force search and rescue duties after undergoing briefings and a familiarization flight, the ministry said in a statement. A six-week deployment to the Falklands is conventional for search and rescue pilots at this stage of their career, it said. ""Flight Lieutenant Wales will be deploying purely in an RAF role and will not be completing any ceremonial roles as the Duke of Cambridge,"" the ministry said. However, the deployment has not been without controversy. This week, Argentina's foreign ministry criticized Britain over the matter. ""Prince William is coming ... as a member of the armed forces of his country,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""The Argentinian people regret that the royal heir is coming to the soil of the homeland with the uniform of the conqueror and not with the wisdom of a statesman who works in the service of peace and dialogue between nations."" Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinian and 255 British troops died. After the war, the United Kingdom retained control of the islands, which are off Argentina's coast in the South Atlantic. News of British plans to deploy the destroyer HMS Dauntless to the region did nothing to dampen the rhetoric from politicians in both countries. While British officials have said the ship's deployment is routine, according to Britain's ITN news network, some Argentinians see it as a provocation. British Prime Minister David Cameron has criticized Argentinian officials for their renewed claims to the island. ""We support the Falklands' right to self-determination, and what the Argentinians have been saying recently, I would argue, is actually far more than colonialism, because these people want to remain British, and the Argentinians want them to do something else,"" he told lawmakers last month. Demonstrators marching outside the British Embassy in Buenos Aires last month burned British flags and urged Argentina to sever ties with London. Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has said the British ""are preying on our natural resources, our oil, our fish"" in the Falklands, known as the Malvinas in Argentina. Fernandez's campaign has won some supporters. In December, members of the Mercosur trade bloc -- which includes Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay -- said they would stop ships bearing the Falkland Islands flag from entering their ports. The move angered some British officials. About 2,500 residents live on the islands, in addition to 1,700 people stationed at the British military's Mount Pleasant Complex there, according to the website of the islands' government.","British prince deployed as part of search and rescue crew .

"Washington (CNN) -- Parents who say that a range of preventive vaccines given their young children can cause serious health problems will have their appeal heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices Monday agreed to decide whether drug makers can be sued outside a special judicial forum set up by Congress in 1986 to address specific claims about safety. The so-called vaccine court has handled such disputes and was designed to ensure a reliable, steady supply of the drugs by reducing the threat of lawsuits against pharmaceutical firms. The questions in the latest case are whether such liability claims can proceed, if the vaccine-related injuries could have been avoided by better product design, and if federal officials had approved another, allegedly safer drug. Oral arguments in the dispute will be held in the fall. The lawsuit was brought by the parents of Hannah Bruesewitz, a girl from the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, area. They said she was in fine health as an infant in 1992 when given a series of DPT shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus. After the third series, according to court briefs, the child began having seizures and became disabled. Now a teenager, Hannah continues to suffer what is described as ""residual seizure disorder."" The Bruesewitzes alleged Wyeth Laboratories failed to adequately warn them and other parents of the risks associated with the vaccine. The vaccine court rejected the initial claim, so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in the federal courts. Their lawyers said the 24-year-old law does not ban all lawsuits, especially those filed when the harmful side effects were avoidable. A federal appeals court eventually ruled for Wyeth, now owned by Pfizer Inc., concluding that all design-defect claims were barred under statute. Despite that victory, the company urged the high court to hear the case, saying it seeks final resolution on broader legal questions. The Obama administration also urged review and is supporting the company and the federal law in question. Wyeth and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe, but side effects can occur in very rare cases. They also say that the vaccine industry is generally not profitable, but that the health benefits for society in general have kept them in the business. For that, they say, legal protection provided by Congress is essential to ensure such drugs are widely available and affordable. The high court did not act immediately on a another related, pending appeal. The Georgia Supreme Court last year became the first appeals court in the U.S. to allow families to sue outside the special vaccine court. That case involved Atlanta-area parents who said their son Stefan Ferrari suffered severe neurological damage 12 years ago from booster shots, by Wyeth and GlaxoSmithKline, containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal. Now 12, the boy is unable to speak, say his parents, Stefano and Carolyn Ferrari. The preservative has since been taken out of nearly all standard vaccines. Despite winning at the state level, the family has since withdrawn its case, but the liability on drug companies resulting from that decision remains in force in Georgia. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act was passed to establish a nationwide strategy to ensure a secure vaccine supply, promote safety and future research, and compensate innocent victims. Those goals were listed at the time as a ""top public health priority."" Lawmakers acknowledged the vaccine supply was suffering under rising company costs from potential liability claims. Despite Food and Drug Administration approval for the vaccines, companies said they were being driven out of the market. The special federal court created under the legislation was a liability shield, designed to be a reliable, relatively quick, no-fault solution to various claims. Unresolved over the years is whether and when certain exceptions to liability should be in play in specific cases. The case accepted is Bruesewitz v. Wyeth (09-152). The pending case is American Home Products Corp. v. Ferrari (08-1120).","Latest case involves liability claim, product design, drug safety questions .

"(CNN) -- Ryan Giggs is venturing where few footballers have gone before. On Friday the Welshman turned 40, marking the start of a new chapter of a career which has seen him achieve unprecedented success with Manchester United. Twenty two years, eight months and 27 days on from his debut for the Old Trafford club, Giggs is officially the most decorated player in English football history. The explosive winger turned midfield playmaker has won 13 Premier League titles, four FA Cups, four League Cups and two Champions League titles, not to mention numerous personal accolades. Whle most middle aged men are worrying about their waistlines, Giggs seemingly remains impervious to the ravages of time. So just what is his secret? According to the man himself -- yoga . ""You can feel it working and you can feel the benefits straight away,"" he was quoted as telling the Manchester Evening News. ""My body feels so much better having done the yoga. ""I still get the odd hamstring strain, which you are going to get playing football, but it wasn't about curing the problem, but making it less frequent. I wish I had done it from the start of my career."" At an age where most players have long since hung up their boots, 8308 days on from his first United appearance as a substitute in a 2-0 defeat by Everton, Giggs is demonstrating rare longevity. ""Ryan is obviously a different player now compared to when he broke through as a 17-year-old winger,"" Henning Berg, who played alongside Giggs at United between 1997 and 2000, told the club's official website. ""But that says a lot about how football has developed in terms of sports science to make sure that players still have enough power and energy to play the physical part of the game."" Even accounting for advances in sports science, Giggs' ability to remain effective at the top level as he enters his fifth decade is still exceptional. Italian defensive stalwart Paolo Maldini, a picture of durability and the rock of a successful AC Milan defense for 24 years, called time on his own glittering career at Giggs' age. Brazilian striker Romario retired in 2008 aged 42, before making a one-game comeback in 2009, saying he was unable to regulate his body weight while not playing regularly. It is Giggs' ability to remain in peak physical condition which sets him apart from other aged soccer stars. Few players could have controlled a top-level match the way Giggs did this week, orchestrating United's 5-0 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in a Champions League group match. United manager David Moyes, who took over from Ferguson at Old Trafford, is still a keen admirer of Giggs' talents. The Scot highlighted Giggs as the perfect role model for any young player looking for a long, successful career in the sport. ""People mention his age but all you should mention is his football ability,"" Moyes, who has appointed Giggs as a player/coach, told a press conference. ""He's an unbelievable footballer. All round he is a wonderful player and I am really fortunate to be working with him. ""Ryan will tell us when he has had enough, or when he thinks his time is up,"" the former Everton manager added. ""He keeps training day in day out and his performances since I came to the club in the summer have been excellent. ""I think, when you get to Ryan's age, it's best to make decisions at the end of the season. It's how you feel, how you've done over the year and what your body is telling you. ""There's no quick decisions on that one. He's on the staff now, so we can always use him at any time!"" Giggs also credits his continued influence and fitness to spending his entire career at one club, avoiding the upheaval which can accompany numerous transfers. ""If I'd moved from club to club I'd be finished by now,"" Giggs said after his virtuoso performance in Leverkusen. ""I'm lucky that I have been at one club, where I am surrounded by good players. I also have a good manager. ""I look after myself and try to train every day in order to make myself available for selection. ""I enjoy it as much as I can and, of course, try to contribute to the team."" For much of his time at United Giggs was part of a group of homegrown players affectionately known as the ""Class of 92"" -- referring to the year United won the FA Youth Cup. Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville all broke into the first team together and went on to achieve era-defining success under the tutelage of legendary United manager Alex Ferguson, who retired last season after 26 years at the helm. In his recently-released book Ferguson refers to Giggs as the leader of the group, who are celebrated in the forthcoming documentary ""Class of '92."" ""He was the King, the man,"" says Ferguson when referring to his longest serving players. On Sunday Giggs could make his 954th appearance for United in its match against Tottenham Hotspur. At 40, he is four years older than Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas, a statistic which puts Giggs' incredible staying power into perspective.","Manchester United midfielder Ryan Giggs celebrates 40th birthday on Friday .

"(Health.com) -- Many radiologists rely on specialized computer software to pinpoint suspicious areas in routine mammograms. But in a large new study, the technology failed to improve breast cancer detection and also increased a woman's risk of being told she had an abnormal mammogram when she was, in fact, cancer free. The study analyzed 1.6 million mammograms taken at 90 radiology facilities in seven states between 1998 and 2006. The findings, which appear online in the ""Journal of the National Cancer Institute,"" extend and confirm the results of a controversial 2007 study from the same research team that cast doubt on the value of the technology, known as computer-aided detection, or CAD. ""Women should probably understand that CAD is probably being used to interpret their mammogram and that it's probably not helping detect breast cancer earlier,"" says Joshua J. Fenton, M.D., the lead author of both studies and an assistant professor of family and community medicine at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine, in Sacramento. Health.com: Simple things that could cut your breast cancer risk . Routine annual mammograms are widely recommended for women 40 and older. The breast X-rays can detect cancer at an early stage, when it's most treatable, but they aren't perfect; they miss up to 20% of breast cancers, according to the National Cancer Institute. Having two radiologists interpret a mammogram has been shown to improve the detection rate. In recent years, studies have found CAD software -- which scans mammogram images and highlights areas that may require a closer look -- to be just as effective in detecting cancers as a second pair of eyes. Vijay M. Rao, M.D., chair of the radiology department at Jefferson Medical College, in Philadelphia, says that in light of the new evidence, radiologists should use more discretion in interpreting CAD results. ""Is it a legitimate pair of eyes? Is it really doing the job that the radiologists want it to do?"" Health.com: Celebrities who battled breast cancer . The Food and Drug Administration approved the first CAD software in 1998, after a series of small clinical studies found that CAD could boost breast cancer detection without causing an unacceptable number of false-positives, cases in which doctors mistakenly identify benign abnormalities as cancerous. CAD is now used in roughly three of every four screening mammograms, according to a 2010 analysis of Medicare data published in the ""Journal of the American College of Radiology."" Medicare pays doctors an additional $12 per mammogram for CAD over and above the reimbursement for the mammogram itself, which ranges from about $80 (for conventional film-screen mammograms) to $130 (for newer digital mammograms). In the new study, which included more than 680,000 women, the researchers examined film mammograms because too few digital mammograms were conducted during the study period to allow a thorough analysis. (Breast X-rays produced on film must be converted to digital images before they can be analyzed by the computer software.) The detection rate for noninvasive breast abnormalities improved at radiology facilities that adopted CAD technology, but, crucially, the rate did not improve for invasive breast cancers, the dangerous type that invade healthy tissue in the breast or other parts of the body. Health.com: Understanding your breast cancer diagnosis . Moreover, in facilities that began using CAD the percentage of women with abnormal mammograms who were accurately diagnosed (a measure known as ""positive predictive value"") dropped, from 4.3% to 3.6%. Rates of false-positives and ""recalls"" -- being called back for further testing -- increased slightly after facilities implemented CAD. However, the biopsy rate declined over time regardless of whether CAD was used. In a similar study published in the ""New England Journal of Medicine"" in 2007, Fenton and his colleagues reported that CAD reduced the accuracy of mammograms and led to a higher rate of false-positives. Health.com: How to help a loved one cope with breast cancer . The new investigation shared the same overall design, but the researchers addressed criticisms directed at the earlier study by including a larger number of CAD screens and by excluding mammograms interpreted in the first three months after a facility adopted CAD, when radiologists were becoming accustomed to using the technology. Despite these improvements, it's still unclear from the new study whether individual radiologists used CAD correctly, or even whether they used it at all, says Carol H. Lee, M.D., chair of the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Commission, and a New York City-based breast-imaging specialist. ""It makes me think that we as a medical community need to further evaluate the use of CAD,"" says Lee, who does not use CAD in her own practice. ""But I don't know that just based on this study that we should abandon this technology."" Health.com: 25 breast cancer myths . The Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance, an Arlington, Virginia,-based trade association that represents medical imaging developers and manufacturers, said in a prepared statement that other recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of CAD. Women should have access to the ""right scan at the right time,"" the association said, whether it's mammography with CAD or another imaging technique. In an editorial accompanying Fenton's study, Donald A. Berry, Ph.D., chair of the department of biostatistics at MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston, says economic incentives -- including the use of CAD as a defense in malpractice suits -- ""may stoke its continued proliferation."" Researchers and device companies should work to make the software better, but in an experimental setting and not while exposing millions of women to a technology that may do more harm than good, Berry writes.

"(CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray was suffering financially with nearly $435,000 in judgments and liens against him over the past two years, according to court documents. Then he decided to leave his practice and work for Michael Jackson, getting paid $150,000 a month. Dr. Conrad Murray was with Michael Jackson on the day that he died. Before working with the King of Pop, Murray spent most of his time operating clinics in both Nevada and Texas after graduating from Meharry Medical College, a historically black school in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1989. He spent his internship and residency years in California. At the clinics in Houston, Texas, and Las Vegas, Nevada, his patients had been surprised to learn that he would be leaving his private practice to work with Jackson.  Watch profile of Dr. Conrad Murray » . Many told news outlets they support their former physician as he faces scrutiny by authorities investigating Jackson's death. ""I don't care what nobody says. He's a damn good doctor,"" Mary Webb, a former patient, told CNN affiliate KTNV-TV. But he was a doctor with financial woes that became evident not long after he graduated from medical school. He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1992 and accumulated $44,663 in state tax liens in Arizona and California from 1993 until 2003, according to court documents. The doctor, who was with Jackson on the day he died, has offices in Houston and Las Vegas and specializes in cardiology and internal medicine, according to state medical boards. Murray's financial troubles continued after opening the clinics -- though outsiders may not have known it, based on his million-dollar home in a gated community next to the Red Rock Country Club in Las Vegas. Murray has been hit with several judgments related to unpaid bills, child support payments, defaults on educational loans and payment for equipment said to have been rented to him. In a statement on his Web site, Murray's attorney said that the doctor continues to travel to see his patients in Houston. The cost of maintaining those relationships exceeds any payment or income he receives for his work, attorney Ed Chernoff said in the statement. Murray saw his patients in addition to his new role as Jackson's doctor. He was hired by promoter AEG to work with Jackson for this summer's ""This Is It"" tour, after the 50-year-old singer requested Murray be around to care for him during the grueling rehearsal and mammoth 50-show tour. The pair met in Las Vegas in 2006, when Murray treated one of Jackson's children at the recommendation of one of Jackson's bodyguards. Murray's attorney says the relationship went beyond just a doctor and a patient. ""Dr. Murray was not a doctor first,"" Chernoff told CNN four days after the entertainer's death. ""He was a friend first. They were close personal friends. Michael Jackson really treated him as family.""  Watch discussion of doctor's relationship with Jackson » . But now, some Jackson family members have accused the doctor of wrongdoing. He has also been the target of three searches by police . Murray's office in Houston was searched last week, and on Tuesday, authorities searched his Las Vegas home and office. No charges have been filed against Murray. The searches came a day after a source confirmed to CNN that Murray administered a powerful drug that authorities believe killed the singer. The drug, known as Diprivan or propofol, is an anesthetic that is normally administered in a hospital setting. But Murray also has no hospital privileges in California, so he could not have treated Jackson in a hospital setting, even on the day he died. Murray hasn't spoken publicly since Jackson's death. Chernoff, his lawyer, told CNN that Murray did not ""prescribe or administer anything that should have killed Michael Jackson."" He also said Murray did not prescribe any powerful painkillers to the star. John Thomas, Murray's friend, said he spoke to the doctor three days before Jackson died to invite him to an event in Las Vegas. Thomas, a regional sales manager for Pit Bull energy products, met Murray when the doctor invested with a distributor to try to bring Pit Bull to his native Trinidad, Thomas told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""He couldn't have been happier then,"" Thomas told the newspaper, reflecting on their last conversation. ""He was apologetic about not being able to come to the opening, but he said he was busy with Michael."" In their last phone call, Thomas told the newspaper, Murray seemed upbeat and said and he ""liked being in the limelight, meeting all the celebrities."" Thomas added that it was also clear in their last conversation that the celebrity salary he was receiving was aiding Murray with ""some of the financial troubles he talked about."" Although Murray remains the target of authorities' scrutiny, those who knew him before Jackson's death struggled to comprehend what could have happened. Webb, one of Murray's Las Vegas patients, said he helped save her life. Webb told CNN affiliate KTNV-TV that she has coronary artery disease and went to Murray, who put in five stents. Through all the pain, Webb insists, Murray would tell her to take only ibuprofen or Tylenol. ""One time I told him, 'If you don't give me something for this pain, I'm checking out,' "" she told KTNV. ""[But] because he did not believe in giving drugs, he did not."" One of Murray's former patients in Houston also praised the doctor, saying he helped save her life when he discovered blockages in her heart. ""If I had to rate Dr. Conrad Murray from 1 to 100,"" Ruby Mosley told CNN affiliate KHOU-TV, ""I'd give him every bit of 100."" Mosley said that without the discovery, she might have had a heart attack, a stroke or an aneurysm. ""He found them,"" she said. ""I credit him and God."" Webb told KTNV that her faith in her doctor remains strong despite the allegations lodged against him. ""If there was any way in Dr. Murray's power to save Michael, he would've,"" she said.","$435,000 in judgments, liens against Dr. Conrad Murray .

"(CNN) -- The number of bird flu cases in China jumped Sunday to 102, including 20 deaths, the World Health Organization announced. Seventy patients remain hospitalized with the virus. The WHO said there is still no evidence of human-to-human transmission. So far the virus has mainly affected eastern China, with 11 deaths and 33 infection cases reported in Shanghai, 24 cases, including three deaths, in Jiangsu Province, 38 cases, including five deaths, in Zhejiang Province, while Anhui Province has confirmed three cases, with one ending in death. Further afield, four people -- including one in Beijing in northern China and three in central Henan Province -- have tested positive for the H7N9 virus. The current strain of bird flu, H7N9, was not detected in humans until last month. A team of international experts are currently in China conducting a week-long assessment of the virus, the WHO said on Friday. ""Right now it is still an animal virus that rarely infects humans,"" Dr. Michael O'Leary, the head of the WHO's office in Beijing, told reporters. On Thursday, the central government suspended wild bird sales to try to prevent the spread of the virus, although many questions remain as to the source of infection. It follows a ban on live poultry trading in affected provinces. A large number of birds have also been slaughtered, state-run Xinhua said. O'Leary said there was legitimate reason for concern about the new virus, but suggested it was premature to begin mass culling of poultry. ""I eat chicken every day,"" O'Leary said with a laugh. ""Chicken is of no concern at all."" Until March, the virus had only been present in birds, which is why they've become the focus of the investigation. However, 40% of patients with H7N9 had not come into contact with poultry, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Authorities are continuing to monitor more than 1,000 people who have come into close contact with confirmed cases. CNN's Miriam Falco and Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.","The cases include 20 deaths, and 102 infection cases .

"(CNN) -- Still think Halloween is just for the kids? You won't -- not when you've seen CNN's gut-twisting, down-right disgusting mob of morbid maniacs. It's that time of year when revelers can let loose with their desire to shock. Getting dressed up ready to terrorize friends, family and strangers in the street has long been the goal for the holiday -- but a few partiers are taking it to another level, with masterfully executed, Hollywood-standard disguises. This Halloween, CNN Celebrates challenged you to scare us stiff. And iReporters from across the globe delivered -- with a ghoul's gallery of ghastly getups, macabre makeup, and grotesque prosthetics, guaranteed to cause some sleepless nights . This Halloween, there'll be tricks... ""What is a Halloween costume if not to be scary?"" asked 26-year-old Californian Amada Kroon, whose ripped-off flesh makeup shocked and turned stomachs. Jennifer Kirkland, an amateur paranormal investigator from Kentucky, agrees: . ""I love scaring people!"" She says. ""For my costume, I wanted something that would send grown men running to their mommas."" Her creation ""Sightless"" succeeded -- a blood-dripping horror with gouged-out eyes, which she turned on unsuspecting visitors at Devine's Haunted Corn Maze in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. There's a perfect form of trickery and illusion required to create a properly adult scare -- although, children and (ahem) dogs aren't afraid to get involved -- but Kirkland says the secret behind truly terrifying outfits is all too simple: . ""I think the more realistic the costume is, the better. Sure, vampires and zombies are cool, but what is really freaky are the costumes that are basically normal people, but with some type of creepy or disturbing element added."" ...and treats . But there's more to the night than shock and disgust. For Jeff Wickliffe (a photographer for 364 days a year -- Pirate Zombie for October 31st) it's an outlet for his gruesome creativity: . ""I'm a creative person and Halloween allows me to let my imagination run wild and display it in a very public way that can't be done the rest of the year,"" he says. ""It's a chance to change into someone else entirely and take a vacation from yourself and enjoy being a character for a night or more"" For others, Halloween holds the opportunity to get together and share in the scares: whether in a family group (like the gloriously grizzly, undead Rausch family), or in a terrifying mass with Berlin's Zombie Walk mob. There, hundreds of undead tricksters gathered together -- ready to groan, share their common interests (like braaaains), trudge menacingly through sightseeing spots, and dance to Michael Jackson's Thriller. And, in the true spirit of the holiday, scare strangers to death.","Every Halloween, horror fans take the opportunity to scare others stiff .

"(CNN) -- Well, it was big. The Michael Jackson memorial service, where daughter Paris spoke briefly, was a big draw on TV and online. The biggest ever? Probably not. Tuesday's memorial service for Michael Jackson was expected to set some high marks for viewership -- and it did. But, based on information gathered by various meter-readers, it was no moon landing or Princess Diana funeral -- events whose audiences, by some reckonings, pushed 1 billion viewers. In the United States, the Jackson memorial aired during the late morning and afternoon, when most people are working. Nielsen, the television ratings service, said that 31.1 million watched: not as many as the Obama inauguration (38 million) but more than the 2009 ""American Idol"" finale (28.8 million). In all or in part, the program was aired on 19 U.S. television networks. In Europe, where the show aired in prime time, the memorial service also did well. The BBC reported that 5.2 million people watched the show on the network BBC2, and 2 million more watched on the British networks Five and Sky News. The service also aired on channels in Germany, France, Australia and Japan, testifying to the King of Pop's worldwide reach. But it was the Internet where the Jackson memorial really hit the heights. Global Web traffic ranged from 19 percent to 33 percent above normal during the event, according to Internet monitoring firm Akamai Technologies. CNN.com reported 9.7 million live video streams between midnight and 5 p.m. PT, as well as 81 million page views, according to internal data. Yahoo News had 5 million live video streams, according to the publication Media Life. The publication also reported that FoxNews.com and MSNBC.com combined for 6.4 million video streams. Anecdotally, Jackson also fared well. Jackson-related topics were highly ranked on Twitter, Google Trends and Alexa. Facebook, which partnered with CNN.com to let friends and family share commentary during the service, reported 800,000 status updates by 1 million users. The Obama inauguration, by contrast, had 600,000 status updates during the event, though there were 1.5 million for the day of the inauguration, according to TechCrunch. Jackson does outrank the president as the most popular person on Facebook, with 7.7 million fans, versus 6.4 million for Obama. In Los Angeles, the Jackson memorial proved to be less of a draw than locals had hoped -- or feared. Though the city staffed the area around the Staples Center, where the memorial was held, with 3,000 police officers -- 1,000 more than had been on hand for the Los Angeles Lakers' victory parade -- the crowd without tickets may have numbered in the thousands, according to unofficial estimates, and not the hundreds of thousands that had been feared. Even inside the memorial, which was held at the Staples Center and the adjacent Nokia Theatre, not every seat of the 20,000 available appeared to be taken, according to CNN observations. The Jackson memorial also drew hundreds of fans, respectively, to gatherings in New York's Times Square, Detroit's Motown Historical Museum, London's O2 Arena and a Tokyo Tower Records store. Jackson is still reigning on the music charts. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the singer had the two best-selling albums in the United States last week -- ""Thriller"" and ""Number Ones"" -- and 13 of the top 20 catalog albums. On iTunes, he has four of the top 10 songs on iTunes and four of the top 10 albums. Finally, where there's a big event, there's at least a little money to be made off the spectacle. At the Staples Center on Tuesday, vendors sold Michael Jackson T-shirts, artwork, decals and even beverages. For the real spectacle, though, one must turn to eBay, where there were at least 50,000 Michael Jackson-related items up for auction as of Wednesday afternoon. Among them: 1984 Topps trading cards ($15.50), official memorial service programs (from $2.99 to at least $10,000, some with wristbands and tickets) and even Web domain names -- one of which, MichaelJacksonForestLawnCemetery.com, can be yours for $650,000. The Jackson magic may have been dominant Tuesday, but someone is obviously expecting it to continue for quite some time longer.","Michael Jackson memorial watched by 31.1 million in U.S.

"(CNN) -- Germany 4-2 Greece . Germany cruised into the semifinals of Euro 2012 as Greece's unlikely run in the tournament was ruthlessly brought to a halt in Gdansk. Philip Lahm's long-range strike, Sami Khedira's superb volley, Miroslav Klose's header and a Marco Reus thunderbolt sealed a comfortable victory. The result only looked briefly in doubt when Giorgios Samaras brought Greece level for six minutes in the second half, while Dimitris Salpingidis made the Greek deficit respectable with a late penalty. Germany's win vindicated a pre-match selection gamble from their manager Joachim Low, who surprisingly rested his three main attackers Mario Gomez, Thomas Mueller and Lukas Podolski. They will all expect to return to the starting line-up when Germany take on either England or Italy in next Thursday's semifinal. ""I thought I had to change things after three wins,"" said Low following the victory. ""That was a class performance. We failed to take an early lead, but we did not panic. We can be proud of the team."" Soccer Live: CNN's blog from Friday's second Euro 2012 quarterfinal . The pre-match talk had centred on political tensions between the two nations over Greece's debt. But the Germans were anything but economical in the opening exchanges as a series of chances went begging. The most inviting fell to Mesut Ozil, who sidefooted weakly at the keeper from 12 yards, while Reus was also wasteful. Greece's players, meanwhile, were models of thrift and caution, with five across the midfield and lone striker Salpingidis subsisting on the merest of scraps. But for all Fernando Santos' side's diligent defending, it was a lack of concentration at the back that led to Germany's opening goal. Lahm was allowed the time and space to cut inside from the left and unleash a swerving 20-yard strike with his lethal right foot. It meant Greece, who had failed to carve out a single chance of note in the first half, needed to revamp their gameplan after the break. Yet even while behind, the underdogs seemed content to keep players back and not leave themselves open to a fatal second goal. This minimalist approach to attacking appeared to be paying off when they equalized courtesy of three touches of real class. The first was a sumptuous pass from Georgios Fotakis into the path of Salpingidis, who burst down the right and delivered a wicked low cross for Samaras to slide the ball home from close range. It was one of the most astonishing moments of the tournament so far, but the Greek jubilation was short-lived. Six minutes later, German superiority was restored when Jerome Boateng crossed and Khedira hammered in a spectacular volley from the edge of the box. Germany's third goal was as soft as their second was brilliant, Klose nodding home from Ozil's corner after the hapless Greek goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis recklessly tried to claim the ball. Reus then added a fourth with a blistering volley after Sifakis parried a Klose strike into his teammate's path. There was time for Salpingidis to grab a consolation from the spot after Boateng was adjudged to have handled in the box. But it would have taken more than that to dent the spirits of a German side who, having been confident enough to rest three key players of a quarterfinal of a major championship, will now have a strong belief they can win it.","Germany beat Greece 4-2 in Euro 2012 quarterfinal .

"New York (CNN) -- You might not know it to read the news of the discredited research that had long linked vaccines to autism, but there really is good progress on the autism research front. • A study published last year in the journal Nature identified a genetic variant that could account for up to 15 percent of autism cases. Once we can determine which proteins are associated with various risk genes, we can start to understand the mechanisms of action that may cause autism. And once we understand the mechanisms of action, we can start to develop targeted therapeutics. • Elsewhere, researchers working with the younger siblings of children with autism are identifying biomarkers that could enable autism to be detected as early as the first few weeks of life. • Clinical trials are under way investigating a compound that has proved effective at rescuing mice from the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, which may be related to autism. • In addition, stem cell and genome scanning technologies hold great promise for autism research. But all of this has been overshadowed by a seemingly relentless preoccupation with the notion that vaccines might cause autism, despite mountains of scientific evidence that have concluded there is no link. It's time for us all to put that behind us. On Tuesday, the medical journal The Lancet retracted the controversial 1998 paper that linked the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism. Last week, the British General Medical Council ruled that Dr. Andrew Wakefield's ""conduct in this regard was dishonest and irresponsible"" when he published the research. The panel's chairman said he'd shown a ""callous disregard"" for the suffering of children. The original Lancet publication had launched an era of anti-vaccine activism. At a news conference after the publication, Wakefield said there were ""sufficient anxieties for a case to be made"" to separate the three vaccines. Vaccination rates plummeted, and measles outbreaks swept across the United Kingdom. Hundreds of children were hospitalized, and several died. Across the country and around the world, parents became stricken with an unfounded fear of vaccination. Because my older daughter had been diagnosed with autism, I read Wakefield's study carefully. I followed his advice to separate the shots when it came time for my younger daughter to be vaccinated in 1999. Looking back, I realize now that that decision left her needlessly vulnerable to vaccine-preventable disease and, frankly, did nothing to reduce the likelihood that she too might be diagnosed with autism. Eventually, Wakefield's collaborators withdrew their names from the Lancet paper. Later it was revealed that he had received funds from lawyers representing the children enrolled in his study and that he obtained control blood samples from children who attended his son's birthday party, paying them 5 pounds apiece. Since the publication, millions of dollars have been spent on multiple international studies examining the Wakefield hypothesis. No study has ever replicated his results. In fact, one study published in 2008 specifically tried to replicate Wakefield's original work and found no evidence that the vaccine had a connection to either autism or GI disorders. (You can read all the autism/vaccine studies here.) At this point, we have to be willing to accept what legitimate science tells us. The science is clear regarding MMR and autism, just as it is with thimerosal (a vaccine preservative that has also been implicated in the past) and autism. Multiple studies have failed to show a causal link. Unfortunately, we still don't know what causes autism, and that is one reason the vaccine hypothesis has been so sticky, even in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence. But we will never find the answers we need about autism if we keep asking the same questions over and over. We need to move forward. The problem is, we can never prove a negative. Science doesn't work this way. We will never be able to say we have done a definitive study showing vaccines don't cause autism. All science can show is the absence of a link. Whereas anti-vaccine parent advocates cite personal anecdotes and state that they know with certainty that their child's autism came from vaccines because ""they know their child,"" scientists talk about the ""preponderance of evidence"" and ""statistical significance."" That is not the stuff from which good soundbites are made. Once you put a scary idea in someone's head, it is very hard to reassure them, even in the presence of compelling science. Anti-vaccine autism activists continue to view Wakefield as a hero willing to take on the establishment and fight for their children. In the meantime, his research has had a lasting negative effect on children's health in that some people are still afraid of immunizations. In some cases, the younger siblings of children with autism are being denied lifesaving vaccines, despite mountains of scientific evidence indicating no link between vaccines and autism. This is the Wakefield legacy. But the aftereffects of Wakefield's false claims don't stop there. Thousands of parents of children with autism were persuaded to pursue ""detoxification"" treatments to reverse nonexistent vaccine damage. At best, these treatments waste time and money. One child died from this ""therapy."" In addition, pediatricians have found it hard to maintain constructive relationships with some families given their implicit accusations that mainstream medicine had harmed their children. It's my hope that today marks a turning point. A staggering amount of work needs to be done to make life better for our families, and we may now be able to focus on moving forward with good science as our guide. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alison Singer.","Alison Singer says link between autism, vaccinations debunked but research progressing .

"(CNN) -- The trial of British mercenary Simon Mann continued Thursday, a day after Mann implicated former friend Mark Thatcher in the alleged plot to overthrow the president of Equatorial Guinea. Simon Mann was arrested after a plane carrying him and about 60 mercenaries landed in Zimbabwe. Mann, a former British army commando, was arrested four years ago in Zimbabwe and extradited to Equatorial Guinea's capital of Malabo earlier this year to face trial for the alleged coup. The trial began Tuesday and a verdict was expected within days. Thatcher, the son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was arrested along with Mann in 2004. He pleaded guilty in South Africa the following year to unwittingly bankrolling the alleged coup plot; he escaped jail time by paying a fine. Thatcher said he had given $275,000 toward the charter of a helicopter, which he originally thought was to be used for commercial purposes, but later suspected was to be used by mercenaries. But Mann said Thatcher knew much more than he claimed, and even helped plan the operation. ""He was not just an investor,"" Mann testified Wednesday. ""I mean, he came on board completely and he became part of the management team."" Excerpts of Mann's testimony were broadcast by Britain's Channel 4 news, which says it has the only camera in the courtroom. Thatcher paid $350,000 in total, Mann said. The money paid for an Alouette III helicopter and a King Air plane which were to be used in the plot, he said. Mann said he brought Thatcher to London to meet with Lebanese businessman Eli Calil. Mann said he himself met with Calil three times in London's Chelsea neighborhood and that, during the third meeting, Calil requested his services. ""He asked me if I would assassinate the president. He also talked about the possibility of a guerrilla war in Equatorial Guinea,"" Mann said in the footage broadcast by Channel 4. Mann testified that he refused both requests, considering them both unethical, but he did agree to help stage a coup -- an idea which he said foreign governments including Spain and the U.S. supported. Mann testified that a scout had been sent to the U.S. to gauge the government's reaction to a possible coup. ""The opinion in Washington, the Pentagon, Langley, and the oil companies was basically all the same, which was that the situation, the political situation, in Equatorial Guinea was very unsatisfactory, very dangerous, and that a well conducted change of government would be welcome,"" he said. The courtroom did not appear packed, with several of the bright red fabric-covered chairs empty. Bespectacled Mann was dressed in a gray prison outfit, clean-shaven, with his hair combed back. Channel 4 said Mann testified for four hours. He spent the first two standing up but he was ""clearly uncomfortable"" and suffering from a hernia, so the judge let him sit for the last two hours, the broadcaster said. Equatorial Guinea prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty for Mann, the country's U.S. ambassador told CNN Tuesday. Mann was arrested four years ago after a plane carrying him and about 60 mercenaries landed in Zimbabwe. The government of Equatorial Guinea said the group was on its way to overthrow its president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, but Mann said at the time that they were going to guard a diamond mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A Zimbabwe court convicted Mann of trying to buy weapons illegally, and he served four years in jail there before his extradition to Equatorial Guinea to face charges of leading an abortive coup. Britain's Foreign Office said it was offering consular assistance to Mann and a consular representative had visited him in prison to check on his welfare. The British consul from nearby Nigeria was attending the start of the trial in a consular capacity, said a Foreign Office spokesman, who declined to be named in line with policy. Britain has no embassy in Equatorial Guinea. Mann once served in the British army and was later affiliated with the South Africa-based mercenary firm Executive Outcomes. The firm described itself on its now-defunct Web site as a ""military advisory service"" that had played a ""crucial"" role in ending two African civil wars. At the end of his testimony Wednesday, Mann offered an apology. ""I would like to say that I am very, very sorry for what I tried to do in 2003 and 2004. I'm very sorry for what I've done,"" he said. ""I'm also very happy that we failed, that it didn't work, that nothing actually happened. I'm very happy that that is the case."" Mann also said that those involved in the plot who had not been prosecuted should now face justice. ""I've been in prison for four years,"" he said. ""I'm not the same man as I was, and that is what I think -- I think they should all face justice."" Equatorial Guinea -- slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Maryland -- is the third-largest oil producer in Sub-Saharan Africa and a supplier to the U.S. and Europe. The former Spanish colony gained independence from Spain in 1968. Obiang seized power in a 1979 coup after which President Francisco Macias Nguema was arrested, tried and executed. Obiang has remained in power despite several reported coup attempts, Britain's Foreign Office says.","Mercenary Simon Mann implicates former friend Mark Thatcher in coup .

"(CNN) -- After two years of bitter legal wrangles, the start of the 33rd America's Cup has been delayed yet again by a lack of wind off the coast of Valencia in Spain. Swiss team Alinghi had been due to begin the defense of their title on Monday morning against American challenger Oracle, but the two giant multihulls were sent back to their bases in the afternoon. Race organizers announced that the opening clash of the three-race series will take place on Wednesday. ""Principal Race officer Harold Bennett and his team on the water had made continuous attempts to seek out a breeze which was of sufficient strength and settled enough in direction across the proposed 20 miles windward Leg One to allow a fair race to be started,"" the event's official Web site reported. ""But, despite their best efforts, the variance at times was over 100 degrees between the gentle breeze at the committee boat some 25 miles offshore, and the planned position of the turning buoy where there was a breeze of around 10-11 knots sometimes."" Alinghi won sailing's premier prize from Team New Zealand in 2003, and then successfully defended it in Valencia in 2007. The syndicate, set up by Ernesto Bertarelli under the auspices of the Societe Nautique de Geneve (SNG), immediately accepted a challenge from Spain's Club Nautico Espanol de Vela (CNEV). This was immediately disputed by the Golden Gate Yacht Club, the organization behind Oracle, setting off a chain of disputes that have lasted right up until the eve of the scheduled races. First off, CNEV were deemed not be acceptable challengers, with a New York court ruling that Oracle should take their place. Alinghi invited multiple challengers before finally agreeing to take on the Americans in a multihull challenge, instead of the usual monohull boat format. Since then the two sides have battles over the date and venue, and more recently over the technical aspects of their boats. Alinghi have entered a 90-foot (27 meter) catamaran, which measures about 120 foot when the bowsprit is taken into account. Oracle will be racing a 90-foot trimaran, which has been significantly modified since its launch almost two years ago. The series has added spice as Oracle is now led by Russell Coutts, who won the cup twice with Team New Zealand and then guided Alinghi to victory against his compatriots in 2003. He was sacked by Alinghi in 2004 but joined Oracle in 2007 to head their challenge. Coutts has yet to indicate if he will be involved in the actual racing, with his team including helmsman James Spithill, a former world match-racing champion, and Volvo Ocean Race winning skipper John Kostecki as tactician. Alinghi is led by skipper/tactician Brad Butterworth, another New Zealander, who has been involved in four America's Cup triumphs, while Bertarelli is helmsman. Oracle are seeking to bring the prestigious event event back to its traditional American home for the first time in 15 years. The cup itself dates back to 1851, making it the oldest competed for in international sport, and was for a long time fought for by British and U.S. syndicates. Alan Bond's Australia II became the first nation outside those naval superpowers to win it in 1983, with the San Diego Yacht Club holding the coveted crown until the emerging Team New Zealand came to prominence in 1995. Races One and Three will be contested over a 40-mile upwind-downwind loop, while Race Two covers 39 miles around an equilateral triangle course comprising a 13-mile beat and two 13-mile reaches.","Start of the 33rd America's Cup has been delayed yet again by a lack of wind in Spain .

American challengers Oracle cruised home by a three kilometer margin despite a poor start -- and now look poised to take the title from their Swiss opponents in the second race on Sunday. The opening race had twice fallen victim to adverse weather conditions this week, and more rough weather delayed proceedings once again. But when the flag eventually came down, Oracle stormed to victory, coming home over 15 minutes ahead of Alinghi. Winning captain James Spithill told the official America's Cup Web site: ""This was one of the hardest days I've had on the boat with the pressure and direction changes. ""But all in all it was a good day. I'm sure there are some improvements we can make, but obviously it was great.""

"(CNN) -- As the U.S. continues limited, targeted airstrikes for the third day in Iraq, political divisions around the scope of U.S. involvement are emerging in Washington. Top-ranking Democrats who appeared on political talk shows Sunday advocated for a limited mission and insisted that the Iraqi government must respond to the growing threat of the extreme militant group ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State but formerly was known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Republicans, meanwhile, are advocating a far more aggressive stance, insisting that ISIS poses a direct threat to the U.S. They urged President Barack Obama to do more than the limited airstrikes he announced Friday. ISIS, which obtained sustained power in parts of Syria, has expanded its deadly grip on parts of Iraq, especially the Kurdish north, where tens of thousands of Yazidi minorities had been forced into mountains, where they're stranded without food and water. Up to 60 children are among those who have died from the extreme conditions. Thousands of Yazidis rescued, Iraqi Human Rights Ministry spokesman says . Dehydration or massacre: Thousands caught in ISIS chokehold . The militant group executes civilians who don't adhere to its version of Sunni Islam. Its goal is to create an Islamic caliphate, which it claims it has already done, calling the regions they control in Iraq and Syria the Islamic State. Obama announced airstrikes to protect the hundreds of Americans working in the region and said humanitarian assistance to Kurdish minorities would be part of a limited mission that he described as a ""long-term project."" But in Washington, Republicans harshly criticized the President and his mission, saying it is too little, too late. The U.S. role . ""ISIS continues to make gains everywhere,"" Republican Sen. John McCain said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Obama's approach to protect military and diplomatic personnel in the area, McCain said, is ""narrow"" in scope and ""clearly very, very ineffective, to say the least."" ""That's not a strategy,"" he said, calling for additional airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to dismantle ISIS and to provide additional military equipment to the Kurds and the Syrian fighters who oppose ISIS. Officials: U.S. airstrikes pound ISIS militants firing at Iraq's Yazidis . That sentiment for an expanded involvement was echoed by Rep. Peter King, R-New York. ""I am saying we should do whatever we have to do,"" the House Homeland Security Committee member said on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" including, ""we take nothing off the table."" On Sunday, Democrats, however, expressed support for the President's targeted airstrikes and cautioned against any broader involvement. ""Escalating it is not on the cards,"" Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, said on ""Meet the Press."" ""We cannot send the troops. We must not send the troops."" But King insisted his support for a broader operation, which includes ""massive aircraft,"" does not involve U.S. combat troops back into the country after nearly a decade of war and three years after the troops left. ""Let's not set up the false argument that there have to be troops on the ground,"" he said. The role of Iraqis . Democrats said Sunday that the U.S. can do little beyond provide humanitarian assistance and protect American personnel. They said it is ultimately up to Iraqis to address the crisis engulfing their country. ""Only Iraq can save Iraq,"" Durbin said. ""If Iraqis come together, al-Maliki put in power someone in power with the Shias and Kurds, perhaps they can do it themselves."" The U.S. relationship with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has deteriorated. He has been blamed for escalating tensions between religious and ethnic sects within Iraq between the Shia majority, the Sunni minority, the Kurds and smaller groups of minorities, causing the destabilization of the country. The Iraqi Parliament is expected to choose a new prime minister soon, and Democrats say that the new leader should unite the shattered country. Democrats say that political reconciliation in Baghdad would be able to address the crisis, which Sen. Ben Cardin, D- Maryland, called a ""civil war."" ""The real cause is that the Iraqi government has not performed the way it should to protect the rights of all Iraqis,"" Cardin said on ""Fox news Sunday."" Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, agreed that the U.S. is not responsible for repairing a country fraught with political divisions. ""This has to be a political strategy that takes place in Baghdad and not in Washington,"" he said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" But King lambasted the Democrats, saying they are providing a limited view of Iraq and the threat of ISIS. He insisted that the problem is much deeper than intra-Iraq turmoil. Threat to the U.S. He called the Democrats' position, which is similar to the one Obama expressed this past week, a ""shameful abdication of American leadership."" King said ISIS is a threat beyond Iraq and Syria, calling the group more powerful than al Qaeda was on September 11, 2001, when the U.S. was attacked. ""I want to hear what he says when they attack us in the United States,"" King said of ISIS. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, offered a similar, dire sentiment of the threat from the militant group shunned by al Qaeda because of its extreme, violent tactics. ""I think of an American city in flames because of the terrorist ability to operate in Syria and Iraq,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Whatever you want to call these guys, they are coming here."" Mideast spiraling in war and terror . CNN's Ashley Fantz, Barbara Starr and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Political divisions around the scope of U.S. involvement in Iraq are emerging in Washington.

"(CNN)  -- Michael Jackson's personal chef Kai Chase says June 25 was shaping up as another typical day in the superstar's usually peaceful and orderly home until an urgent plea from Jackson's personal doctor sent panic sweeping through the household. Michael Jackson's personal chef Kai Chase appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Thursday night. In an interview with CNN's Larry King that aired Thursday night, Chase described the chaotic events that fateful day and what life was like inside the Jackson family before the singer's shocking death. Chase said she was downstairs preparing lunch for Jackson -- being sure to wrap it in Saran wrap because the singer liked his meals served room-service style -- when Dr. Conrad Murray called out for her. Murray is the central focus of a federal investigation into the singer's death, a law enforcement official told CNN on Wednesday. Around noon or a little after, Chase said, ""Dr. Murray comes down the stairs. There was a stairwell that leads into the kitchen. And he's screaming: Hurry! Go get Prince. Call security. Get Prince."" Chase said she quickly got Jackson's oldest son. ""Within minutes, the paramedics are there. And the security is running upstairs, skipping stairs and all of a sudden we're all, you know, panicked,"" Chase told King. ""So the energy in the house had just kind of changed from that happy kind of day that we were having and preparing lunch and having a good time to just kind of eerie.""  Watch Chase's interview with Larry King » . Chase said Jackson's daughter, Paris, started crying and calling out for her father as people in the home came to realize how serious the medical situation was. ""We started crying and we all come together in unity in a circle and we started holding hands. And we started praying,"" Chase said. The chef said she was not allowed into the upstairs quarters of the home, but she had seen Michael Jackson downstairs on Wednesday, June 24. Nothing she saw the day before cause her alarm. ""He ate lunch with his children at the dinner table. And then I packed ... his dinner for him to go to his rehearsal. He seemed like he was just, you know, tired,"" Chase said. She attributed the way he felt to his long rehearsals. Chase said Jackson did complain once about his demanding schedule. ""The third day I was there, when I came back, he had told me, 'You know, they're killing me. They're killing me because I'm working too much. I'm rehearsing too much.' "" Between 1 and 1:30 p.m. June 25, Chase said security asked her to leave the home, and she never saw Michael Jackson being transported to the hospital. She didn't learn of Jackson's death until later that day on the radio. Chase said that Murray was in the house often in June and she attributed the doctor's frequent presence to Jackson's rigorous rehearsal schedule for an upcoming series of concerts in London, England. Search warrants filed Thursday in court in Clark County, Nevada, and carried out at Murray's offices imply that investigators looking into his death believe the singer was a drug addict. In his interview with Chase, King pressed for details of evidence of drug use by Jackson: . King: Did you notice oxygen tanks, because if it was Diprivan and they have to measure ... your blood pressure? They also need oxygen tanks if you're giving that drug. Did you notice them? Chase: I saw the oxygen tanks, yes. King: Where were they? Chase: I would see Dr. Murray carrying the oxygen tanks down in the mornings. King: On that morning or other mornings? Chase: No. I didn't see him that morning. I saw him in the afternoon, but other mornings. King: He would carry them down? Chase: Carry them down. King: They were portable oxygen tanks? Chase: Yes. Chase said she just recently learned the warrants to search  Murray's offices cited her name as a suspected alias for Michael Jackson. ""I was just made aware of that from my publicist. I think that is ... appalling. I have no clue what that is about,"" Chase said. She said detectives came to her home right after the death but did not ask her about her name being on any prescriptions. ""I don't know what make of it,"" Chase told King. Chase, who said she's been a professional chef for about 14 years, said she's seen the Jackson children since June 25. ""They're doing great. And I saw them a couple of weeks ago,"" she said. ""And they look great and they're playing with their cousins and having a good time."" Chase said she was first employed by Jackson in March but was let go. She said Jackson asked her to come back to their California residence in June and that the children were happy about her return. She said the children gave her a ""box of happiness"" on return that contained little gifts and letters. One of them read in part: . ""Dear Kai, thank you for the gifts and the gumbo. I hope you enjoy the gift. I think you'll like it. Love, Prince Jackson."" Chase said she said no evidence that Michael Jackson was a poor eater. In fact, she said just the opposite was true from her observations. ""He ate very well,"" she said. ""He ate organic and fresh. He [was] into the health foods and juices and things of that nature."" Chase briefly addressed other subjects: . • On Katherine Jackson, Michael's mother: ""I saw the interaction with them when I went to the home. ... They love their grandma, you know. It's a beautiful bond that they have together."" • On Jackson's ex-wife having visitation rights to her children: ""I think Debbie Rowe should see and raise her children."" • On Jackson's planned London shows: ""We started talking about bringing, you know, video games and stuff to the private jet. And it was just, you know, he was very excited about going on this -- doing this tour. This is his comeback."" Life in the Jackson household -- from Chase's account -- was a loving and cheerful one and that he loved his three children. ""You know, I would bring ... the lunches and set them on the table and they'd all come in and sit, close the door and they'd dine privately. And you would just hear laughter and story-telling and just beautiful things. Those were his babies.""","Kai Chase served as Michael Jackson's personal chef, said he ate well .

"(CNN) -- Great survivors were molded from Liberia's bloody war that ended just six years ago. Among the violence and tragedy, new leaders emerged, including youth activist Kimmie Weeks. ""Going through the war and having that experience of nearly dying, essentially made me a stronger person,"" he told CNN. At the age of 9, civil war entered Weeks' life. He had to flee his family home during the fighting, turning his life upside down. Weeks published a report on the Liberian government's involvement in training child soldiers in 1998 and was then forced into exile in the U.S. The experience of finding other children his age engaged in the fighting, and being so close to death himself, was a profound one. Since the war in Liberia he has dedicated his life to saving the country's children from war and its devastating long-term effects with Youth Action International.","Kimmie Weeks experienced Liberia's bloody civil wars first hand .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Nearly 150 former employees of Japan Airlines sued the company Wednesday, demanding their jobs back. The 146 pilots and flight attendants filed suit in Tokyo District Court on the first anniversary of JAL's filing for bankruptcy protection. The airline underwent major restructuring in 2010. Most of the staff reduction came through voluntary retirements, but the airline fired 165 employees at the end of 2010 to achieve targets. The airline cut nearly 30% of its workforce -- more than 16,000 employees -- based on a court-approved restructuring plan. JAL representative Hideo Seto urged people to focus on the positive. ""We would like you to understand the fact that we have protected 36,000 jobs rather than how many people we laid off,"" Seto said. ""We used the public money and eliminated many aircraft. Therefore we need to cut staff who works there. We have no other way than firing the employees."" The airline's chairman, Kazuo Inamori, said Wednesday JAL had a ""bright outlook."" ""We all have worked hard to reduce costs and, as you know, we have achieved a financial result far exceeding the rehabilitation plan,"" the 78-year-old chairman said. ""In that sense, we have a bright outlook for JAL's reconstruction,"" he said after a visit to maintenance crews working on a jumbo jet. ""My biggest concern was how the morale of workers was affected by the major restructuring, which was really a tragedy,"" said Inamori. ""Fortunately, they are all in good spirits and working hard for the company's reconstruction."" Under the drastic restructuring plan based on the Corporate Rehabilitation Law, the former national flag carrier got a debt waiver of 520 billion yen (about $6.3 billion) from banks. It also got a 350 billion yen (about $4.3 billion) cash injection from the quasi-governmental Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation of Japan (ETICJ) in return for delisting its stocks, cutting more than 16,000 employees, 44 aircraft and 51 flight routes in 2010. It achieved a dramatic turnaround in the first 8 months, making 146 billion yen in profit. It is aiming to list its stocks again by the end of 2012. Japan's airline industry expects even tougher competition as low cost airlines are trying to join the market. ""Competing only in low price would be very dangerous as we are not yet strong enough financially and structurally. Rather than becoming such an airline, we would like to aim to remain as a high-quality airline,"" said Inamori. Meanwhile, JAL announced a new logo in a news conference. ""We will depart from the past and create a new JAL,"" airline president Masaru Onishi said, expressing JAL's ""gratitude for the chance given to us a year ago."" The new logo is a soaring Japanese red-crown crane with its wings extended in full flight. The design was changed a little from the original trademark that went out of use in 2008. ""We decided to employ the logo design using JAL's original trademark crane motif to symbolize our determination returning to the challenging spirit we had at the foundation of this company,"" said Onishi.","The suit comes on the anniversary of JAL's filing for bankruptcy protection .

The alleged leader of the group was a Pakistani man based in Thailand. He allegedly gave orders to other suspects in Europe about the type of passports to be stolen -- including the nationality and age of the passport holder -- so they could be sent to Thailand, forged and later used by terrorists to cross borders more easily in Europe and the West, the statement said. ""This operation has neutralized an important cell that provided passports to al Qaeda, so that the forgery apparatus of this organization is weakened internationally, and also its operational capability,"" the statement said.","The man, 30, was missing when police arrested 10 suspects in December .

"(CNN) -- Venus Williams rolled back the clock at the Rogers Cup in Montreal Saturday to claim victory over her younger sister and World No 1. Serena Williams for the first time in five years. The unseeded Venus lost the first set of the semifinal matchup on a tie break but battled back to win 6-7 (7/2) 6-2 6-3 in just over two hours. Venus secured what was effectively the match-wining break in the sixth game of the final set before holding her nerve to serve out. Despite firing down 19 aces, Serena will be left to rue making considerably more unforced errors than her sister, including nine double faults. ""The level of game we played was pretty high,"" Venus was quoted as saying by the WTA website after the match. Venus has struggled for form in recent years and has suffered from injury and illness. But she has bounced back in 2014 and already has one WTA title for the year under her belt. On finding her way back in to the game, she said: ""I've been working hard, and more importantly I've been feeling better. ""I hope I can keep some of this control in my life. If I have that control, I can enjoy being on the court, and I can win as well."" Although she came up short on Saturday, Serena still leads the family head to head in competitive matches by 15-11. The pair have won 26 major singles titles between them (17 for Serena and nine for Venus) and first faced off in the Australian Open in 1998. Speaking on court after the match, Serena described being disappointed with some of her own play but was happy to see her sister perform so convincingly. ""She was really opening the court well,"" Serena said. ""She (Venus) is such a good mover. ""I think her serve was way more consistent than mine. I had more aces, but she was just serving better. ""Ultimately I think she returned better as well."" Venus will now play either Agnieszka Radwanska or Ekaterina Makarova, who meet in the day's other semi-final.","Venus Williams defeats her sister Serena in Rogers Cup semifinal .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams maintained her dominance of Denmark's former world number one Caroline Wozniacki with a typical fightback in the quarterfinals of the Rogers Cup in Montreal. Williams has only lost once to Wozniacki in eight meetings, back in 2012, but looked in danger of a rare defeat when she trailed a set and 4-2. The world number one fell 15-30 on her next service game before hammering home one of her 15 aces of the day on the way to a run of 10 straight points to level at 4-4. A further break of service saw Williams take the second set and she led 2-0 and 4-2 in the decider. Wozniacki, who was playing some of her best tennis of the year, twice leveled but the top seed pulled ahead again to close out the match 4-6 7-5 7-5 in two hours 41 minutes. It was to set up a semifinal match with her elder sister Venus, who later also came from a set down to beat Carla Suarez Navarro. The Spaniard had put out Maria Sharapova in the last 16 and she led Williams a set and 2-0 before the seven-time grand slam champion hit back. She won 10 of the next 11 games to go 4-1 up in the decider and although Navarro briefly rallied she was always trailing. Venus eventually closed it out 4-6 6-2 6-3 in two hours 11 minutes to earn her 25th career match up with Serena, who leads 14-10 in wins. At the men's Rogers Cup tournament, the Masters 1000 event in Toronto, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga continued his fine run with a three-set victory over former Wimbledon champion Andy Murray. 13th seed Tsonga had won the first set on a tiebreak, but after Murray had leveled at one set all, the Frenchman trailed 0-3 in the decider and looked set to go out. However, he rallied to win six of the next seven games to reach the semifinals. Tsonga, who beat top seed Novak Djokovic in the previous round, will take Bulgaria's rising your star Grigor Dimitrov for a place in the final. Dimitrov, the seventh seed, accounted for South Africa's Kevin Anderson in a marathon three-setter 5-7 7-5 7-6.","Serena Williams beats Caroline Wozniacki in Montreal .

"(CNN) -- Sergio Garcia could lose a lucrative sponsorship deal after his ""fried chicken"" jibe directed at golf's World No.1 Tiger Woods. Garcia apologized Wednesday for his off the cuff remarks at an official dinner, but the Spaniard's equipment and clothing sponsor TaylorMade-adidas has gone public with its displeasure over the remarks. ""Sergio Garcia's recent comment was offensive and in no way aligns with TaylorMade-adidas Golf's values and corporate culture,"" said a statement released by the company. Its long standing backing of former World No.2 Garcia stretches back to 2002 but appears to have been placed under strain over the controversy. ""We have spoken with Sergio directly and he clearly has regret for his statement and we believe he is sincere. ""We discussed with Sergio that his comments are clearly out of bounds and we are continuing to review the matter,"" it concluded. There was more embarrassment for golf Thursday afternoon when European Tour chief executive George O'Grady issued an apology for using the word ""colored"" during an interview defending Garcia. O'Grady claimed that many of Garcia's friends were ""colored athletes"" and has since apologized. He said: ""I deeply regret using an inappropriate word in a live interview for Sky Sports, for which I unreservedly apologize."" Garcia, who finished with a level par 72 in his first round of the European Tour's flagship PGA Championship at Wentworth Thursday, was clad from head to foot in the products of his biggest sponsor. But he has admitted that the racist row which exploded after his comments had left him severely distracted. ""It was tough to hit a shot (in the pro-am) without thinking about it,"" the 33-year-old told gathered reporters. Garcia has had an uneasy relationship with Woods for a number of years and it deteriorated to an all- time low after the Tour's annual dinner Tuesday night. Answering questions from the media, he was asked if he would invite his American rival to dinner at next month's U.S. Open. Garcia quipped he would have him round every night and serve fried chicken, a remark associated with racial stereo typing when used in reference to African Americans. Woods responded on his twitter account, saying the comments were ""hurtful and inappropriate"" but later tried to diffuse the row. ""I'm confident that there is real regret that the remark was made. ""The Players ended nearly two weeks ago and it's long past time to move on and talk about golf."" Woods, who won the Players Championship, was involved in a spat with Garcia after the third round at Sawgrass -- where they were paired together. Garcia claimed he was disturbed by Woods as he hit a shot and later admitted his relationship with the 14-time major winner was strained. ""You can't like everyone,"" he said. The saga echoes a 1997 incident after Woods won his first U.S. Masters title. Former Masters champion Fuzzy Zoeller was asked what choice Woods might make at the major's annual dinner the following year -- as would be his right as the holder. ""You pat him on the back and say congratulations and enjoy it and tell him not serve fried chicken next year. Got it? Or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve."" Zoeller's reputation took a battering in the row that followed and despite issuing an apology, which Woods accepted, he also later shed a key sponsorship deal with K-Mart. On the course, South Africa's James Kingston ended the first day at the top of the leaderboard after carding a six-under 66. Kingston, who lost his card last season, hit four birdies in his final seven holes. ""You are not automatically invited into most of these events, so it's tough to plan your schedule,"" he told reporters after carving out a one-shot lead over Finland's Mikko Ilonen. ""It takes one good week and things change, so I am hoping to make the best of this week. World No.2 Rory McIlroy endured a disappointing day, finishing the day on two-over par following his round of 74. He told reporters: ""It was tricky. The conditions obviously were not ideal, so it is tough to shoot a low score out there. I felt I was doing well after the first 12 holes but I just let the round get away from me. ""In the first 12 holes I didn't really miss a shot, but I am not getting as much out of my rounds as I should do.""","Sergio Garcia's clothing and equipment sponsor places his deal under 'review'

"(CNN) -- Day after day, men and women from Soweto, a township near Johannesburg, wake up at the crack of dawn to battle bumper-to-bumper traffic and cramped public transport to show up at work in time. For Mxolishi Colossa, who works at a Johannesburg home furniture store, it's no different. Every morning, he quietly slips out of his house at 6 a.m. and heads to the nearest main street. There, standing by a dusty road, he waits patiently for a minibus taxi to pass by and carry him to the local train station. But it's not just the waiting that tests Colossa's early start to the day -- the high cost of the ride and the dangerous driving can be equally distressing. ""All of them, same style,"" says Colossa, referring to the perilous way in which many of the taxi drivers navigate the area's roads. As the dawn fades away, Colossa jumps off the taxi to catch a train to Johannesburg. Fourteen stops later he pulls into the city but he still has to get another taxi to take him to the other side of Johannesburg, to Melrose Arch, the plush shopping area where he works. He finally arrives at the store at 8.30 a.m. -- a full two-and-a-half hours after leaving his home. ""It's not acceptable for people to have to take multiple legs of a journey to get to work,"" says Rehana Moosajee of the Mayoral Committee for Transport in Johannesburg. See more: Concerns over 'insanity' of Shell South Africa fracking plans . Despite some of the best roads on the continent and a number of high-profile infrastructure projects, including a high-speed train and a bus service built for the 2010 football World Cup, commuting in Johannesburg is often an arduous task for millions of people. The slick new services often don't connect with each other and older public transport systems, leaving poor and working-class people struggling to get to work. Last year, in IBM's Commuter Pain Survey, Johannesburg was ranked fifth worst in terms of the amount of pain commuters suffer getting to and from work. Moosajee admits that the current transit situation doesn't cater well to the economic needs of Johannesburg, adding that the city is working to better integrate its transport system. ""We are now trying to transform our cityscape to bring communities together, and the impact of the number of transfers that people have to do means that people are spending less quality time with their family, that they're spending more and more time in transit, affecting productivity, affecting the economy,"" she says. For Colossa, the grind of commuting means he has to dedicate five hours a day to travel to and from work. The fragmented journey also means that he has to spend a third of his salary on public transport, with the remainder spent on food, bills and rent. Colossa's story is echoed not only around Johannesburg but in many other economic hubs across Africa. In Nairobi, home to three million people, citizens face the fourth most painful commute, according to IBM's survey. Two out of three people in Kenya's capital say that congestion has a negative impact on their work, family and health, IBM reports. Read more: Can Kenya avoid Africa's resource curse? But besides nerves and frustration, traffic jams in Nairobi cost the economy over 50 million Kenyan shillings ($600,000) per day in lost productivity, fuel consumption and pollution, according to official figures. Andre Dzikus, of U.N. Habitat, says the organization is helping Kenya to tackle some of the challenges brought about by population growth, urbanization and a rapid increase in motor-vehicle ownership. Its ""Promoting Sustainable Transport Solutions for East African Cities"" project aims to reduce growth in private motor vehicles, thus reducing traffic congestion and greenhouse-gas emissions. In Lagos, one of the world's megacities, getting to work often requires strong nerves. Snail-paced traffic and high costs test commuters' endurance as millions of people cram the streets of Nigeria's economic nerve center on a daily basis. Commuters often depend on a ragtag array of service providers, such as minibus operators, who can charge whatever prices they want. ""They might charge $1 in the morning for one trip one way and by afternoon they can go to $3,"" says Dayo Mobereola, managing director of the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority, noting that commuters spend on average 40% of their income on transportation. Mobereola says that in recent years the city has taken a series of steps to improve its public transportation offering, including the launch of a regulated bus rapid-transit system in 2008. Read more: Underwater cables bring faster internet to West Africa . More recently, it has begun work to develop a reliable and affordable urban rail system. Two railway lines are already under development as the ambitious project, which will eventually consist of seven lines, aims to relieve Lagos of chronic gridlock and unregulated services. ""The people of Lagos are yearning for regulated means of transportation,"" says Mobereola. Back in Johannesburg, Colossa is about to begin his journey back to Soweto.

"Washington (CNN) -- The chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee is accusing the VA of ""what appears to be an attempt to mislead Congress and the public"" by manipulating the number of veterans who died as a result of delays in care. In a letter to the VA secretary, Chairman Jeff Miller says the VA gave questionable information on a fact sheet distributed during a briefing to his committee in April and has consistently repeated that information in congressional testimony and to journalists. The VA's ""fact sheet"" from April 7 confirms 76 patients were harmed as a result of delays in gastrointestinal care and ""of these 76 patients, 23 have passed away,"" citing a ""national review ...of all consults since 1999."" But more recent documents from the VA sent to Miller, a Florida Republican, show those deaths actually came from a much shorter period, from 2010 to 2012, which may indicate there could be more deaths because of delays than the VA has reported. Even former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki repeated the questionable information during a news briefing on Capitol Hill. ""We went back in time 15 years. Out of that, we probably looked at 250 million consults. That was narrowed down to 76 institutional disclosures, of which there were 23 deaths that had occurred,"" Shinseki said in May, about two weeks before he resigned because of systemic delays in care and findings that VA schedulers manipulated patient wait times. In a statement to CNN, Miller said, ""The VA scandal was created by selfish bureaucrats who lied in order to hide problems. Now it appears those involved in the creation of this fact sheet, including a number of folks who work in the department's central office headquarters, engaged in a similar sort of reprehensible behavior. ""This is further proof that VA's statistics -- and certain department employees -- simply cannot be trusted. If VA Secretary Robert McDonald can't offer a logical explanation for what happened, he needs to act quickly to hold those responsible for this misdirection accountable."" Senate confirms Robert McDonald as VA secretary . CNN reached out late Tuesday afternoon to the VA for comment but hasn't received a response. CNN has been investigating and publishing reports of wait lists and deaths of veterans across VA hospitals across the country for nearly a year. Since August 2013, CNN has repeatedly requested records from the VA through the Freedom of Information Act, but the agency so far has not provided many key documents. Miller's letter to McDonald on Monday asks for more information on what he describes as ""an incredibly serious matter."" Miller requested the VA provide the House Veterans Affairs Committee with details on the total number of deaths and serious ailments caused by health care delays by next week. To ensure accuracy, Miller asked the VA to clarify whether the numbers provided are ""self-reported"" because of evidence of widespread data manipulation at many VA facilities. Miller also asked that the VA share the names of the employees responsible for creating and reviewing the fact sheet that stated the 23 deaths dated back to 1999. ""Our committee has learned that none of the deaths identified by the review of high interest consults occurred prior to 2010,"" Miller said. ""By name, what specific person is was responsible ...?"" Miller learned that the 23 deaths occurred from 2010 and 2012 in a letter he received in July from the VA's then interim under secretary for health, Dr. Carolyn Clancy. That letter also reported 24 deaths, instead of the previous 23, perhaps indicating another veteran has died since April. Clancy's letter also stated 20 veterans in Columbia, South Carolina, and seven veterans in Augusta, Georgia, suffered ""death or serious injury"" because of delays in colonoscopies and endoscopies. A lack of gastrointestinal doctors and an inefficient ""tracking"" system caused the delays, among other factors, according to her letter. In a response to a previous question from Miller about how the VA disciplined those responsible for the delays in Columbia and Augusta, Clancy wrote that the chief of staff at the Augusta VA medical center received ""verbal counseling"" and voluntarily stepped down. An employee in Columbia, whose name was redacted, ""received a reprimand and continues to be employed at the medical center,"" and two other employees there voluntary retired, according to the letter. The letter does not say any employees in Columbia or Augusta have been fired because of the delays in patient care. The VA's letter also said delays in gastrointestinal appointments in Columbia and Augusta have been resolved, but data recently released from the VA shows that about 11,000 patients in Columbia are waiting more than 30 days for various appointments and about 3,000 in Augusta are waiting this long. A recent report compiled by the office of Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, found that more than 1,000 veterans might have died in the past decade as a result of malpractice or lack of care from VA medical centers. In his confirmation hearing in July, McDonald vowed to transform the embattled federal health care system. ""The seriousness of this moment demands urgent action,"" McDonald wrote in his testimony.

"(CNN) -- For decades, residents in Makoko have boarded wooden canoes to navigate through a labyrinth of narrow waterways crisscrossing a floating shanty town perched on stilts above Lagos Lagoon's murky canals. Lacking access to basic infrastructure, including clean drinking water, electricity and waste disposal, and prone to severe environmental and health hazards, Makoko is one of the many chaotic human settlements that have sprouted in Lagos in recent years. Its makeshift shacks shelter thousands of people fighting for space in one the world's most crowded cities. But in late July, scores of Makoko dwellers were left homeless after Lagos authorities swooped into the low-lying coastal community and demolished many of the community's houses and other illegal structures. Interactive: Lagos - Engulfed by floods . Officials cited security concerns for the operation -- the water village had grown dangerously close to a major bridge and the electrical towers surrounding it. In the past, local authorities have also said that the ever-growing slums built on flood-prone wetlands put an additional burden on the city's inadequate drainage systems. Yet the demolition left a large number of people displaced and homeless overnight, their possessions disappearing into the water. Without a place to go, many have since taken to their canoes for shelter or squatted with neighbors. ""We can't keep living like this,"" says Makoko resident Paul Adiroba. ""We are human beings, we are not animals."" Related: A look inside Nigeria's floating slum . Some say that Makoko residents are paying the price of an ambitious urbanization effort. Felix Morka, executive director of the Social and Economics Rights Action Center, says that Makoko residents were given just a 72-hour notice to evacuate their homes. ""The government has a duty to organize its resources and mobilize its resources to improve this city,"" he says. ""But destroying people's homes without due process is not the way to go about it -- that is counterproductive."" Read related: Africa's daily commuting grind . But for others villages like Makoko need to be torn down if Lagos is to develop into a world class city. Nigeria's commercial capital and economic nerve center, Lagos has a population of some 15 million people, making the sprawling city bigger than London, Buenos Aires and even Beijing. In Metropolitan Lagos there are 20,000 people per square kilometer while authorities estimate that some 3,000 people from other states of the Nigerian federation enter the state every day without leaving. Read more: Nigeria's growth leaves elderly behind . Professor Johnson Bade Falade, Habitat Program Manager for Nigeria, says that a number of socio-economic factors have led to Lagos experiencing an ""astronomical growth"" between the 1960s and now. ""At the time Lagos was growing there wasn't too much importance attached to physical planning,"" he explains. ""We were left with the kinds of challenges that cities are growing, planning is not complete."" About 70% of the city's population is believed to live in slums, while a 2006 U.N report estimated that only 10% of households in the Lagos Metropolitan area were directly connected to a municipal water supply. Beset by a swelling population, expanding slums and crumbling infrastructure, Lagos authorities have undertaken a series of urbanization efforts in recent years to modernize the sprawling city's facilities. Read related: Underwater cables bring faster internet to West Africa . Falade says that ""a breath of fresh air has come over Lagos,"" in the recent years. ""The difference is clear, the evidence is the improved landscape of Lagos in the urban regeneration project."" The city has launched a regulated bus rapid-transit system and has begun work to develop a reliable and affordable urban rail system as part of efforts to sort out its legendary snail-paced traffic. A gleaming fleet of new garbage trucks is also being deployed to deal with the 10,000 tons of waste generated every day. But perhaps the most impressive project for the Lagos of tomorrow is no other than the Eko Atlantic, a pioneering residential and business development located on the Victoria Island, along its upmarket Bar Beach coastline. The ambitious project is being built on three and half square miles of land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean and is expected to provide accommodation for 250,000 people and employment opportunities for a further 150,000. ""This is a city for the 21st century, we are not using an old model,"" says David Frame, managing director of Eko Atlantic. ""We are finding ways and means to produce a city that will reach international standards."" Many hope that urban renewal projects like the Eko Atlantic will bring more investment opportunities to the city. ""So we have a lot of opportunity for recreational facilities as well as providing a core business center and a good place to live right on the coast of Lagos,"" says Frame. It's clear Lagos needs to quickly develop its overburdened infrastructure to accommodate the needs of a rapidly increasing population and provide jobs, education and proper infrastructure or risk significant social upheaval. But it also seems that in the race to rebuild some, like the Makoko residents, may be left behind. ""There is a more responsible way to engage in development activity,"" says Morka. ""The government must see the people not as marginal to the city, they must be seen as integral to the city. They are part of this population.""","Lagos authorities have demolished houses in one of the city's coastal slums .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- French rescue workers pulled a 24-year-old man alive from the rubble of a hotel in Haiti on Saturday, 11 days after an earthquake devastated much of the country. Wismond Jean-Pierre, who had no visible injuries but was severely dehydrated, was immediately loaded into an ambulance and taken to a hospital for treatment. Lt. Col. Christophe Renou, a rescuer with the French team, called the three-hour effort ""a miracle"" as he was briefly overcome with emotion. Other members of the team -- assisted by American and Greek workers -- were seen weeping with joy following the rescue. ""This is God,"" Frank Louvier, the chief of the French rescue team, said as he pointed to the sky. Full coverage | Twitter updates . The man's brothers said they reported hearing tapping from within the ruins of the Hotel Napoli Inn for several days but struggled to get authorities to the scene. A Greek journalist said he alerted Greek rescue workers after hearing the tapping for himself. Jean-Pierre was a clerk at a store in the hotel. After the building collapsed, he searched in the dark and found some soda that sustained him, his brother said. His rescuers told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that cookies and beer were also found in the pocket after Jean-Pierre was rescued. In video shot by French Civil Protection, Jean-Pierre is seen wriggling out of an opening in the rubble no wider than his shoulders, a big smile on his face as he sees his rescuers for the first time. Renou said Jean-Pierre was found in a pocket in the rubble and was able to move all of his extremities. A doctor who examined him said Jean-Pierre was protected by a desk. Renou said Jean-Pierre did not say much when he was pulled out but indicated that there were three or four people around him when the building collapsed. However, Jean-Pierre told rescuers he had not heard any sounds around him for a couple of days. Workers were going into the rubble with radar equipment to check for any other possible survivors. The emotional rescue came a day after the Haitian government said that more than 111,000 people died in last week's earthquake. It is the worst death toll from an earthquake since the 2004 Asian tsunami and the second-highest death toll from an earthquake in more than three decades, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Meanwhile Saturday, much of Haiti was mourning as rescue operations turned into recovery missions and the country's president attended the funeral of an archbishop who was one of the victims. A Mexican rescue team pulled the body of 63-year-old Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot from ruins near the national cathedral, which he oversaw as archbishop of Port-au-Prince. The cathedral was destroyed. Read more about the funeral . At the funeral, President Rene Preval was asked to respond to criticism that he has not shown strong public leadership and been largely unseen in the aftermath. ""This is not about politics today,"" he said. Friday night's star-studded ""Hope for Haiti"" telethon raised a record-breaking $58 million, with more donations continuing to pour in from around the world, the benefit's organizers announced Saturday. Additionally, the ""Hope for Haiti Now"" album, a compilation of the night's musical performances made available on Apple's iTunes, was the No. 1 album in 18 countries Saturday. Read more about the telethon . Before the search-and-rescue effort ended Friday afternoon, the U.N. office said, rescuers had managed to pull more than 130 people alive from the rubble. ""Rescue teams continue to work in Port-au-Prince. We continue to hope that they will be able to find people still alive, but as time passes, we must gradually shift our resources from rescue to recovery,"" Nick Birnback, spokesman for U.N. peacekeeping operations, said Saturday. Some families of Americans who were staying at the collapsed Hotel Montana started an online petition Saturday in an effort to continue search efforts there ""until all the survivors are accounted for."" As of Saturday night, the petition had generated nearly 1,400 signatures and 3,600 messages to U.S. government officials, according to Sue Keller, a friend of a family whose relative is among the missing. Keller said the families hope to have at least 5,000 signatures by Monday. Meanwhile, 120 to 140 flights a day are regularly arriving at the single-runway Port-au-Prince airport, compared with 25 the day after the quake struck January 12, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. To relieve congestion at the airport, humanitarian cargo is being moved to a forward dispatch area at one end of the runway. The Las Americas airport in Santo Domingo, in the neighboring Dominican Republic, is starting to report congestion as it becomes increasingly useful as an alternative airport, the U.N. office said. It will now be open overnight to accommodate the extra traffic. The U.S. military has obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic's air base at San Isidro, about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Port-au-Prince. Port-au-Prince's main port is now working at 30 percent capacity, which should increase in the coming days, the U.N. agency said. The port is handling only humanitarian cargo and is still closed to commercial traffic. See where aid is available . Haiti is negotiating with the Dominican Republic to use the port at Barahona, about midway between the two countries' capitals, for more humanitarian deliveries. Those managing the land transport of supplies will need fuel, and the U.N. agency said there is enough in Haiti to last an additional 18 to 19 days. But it expects no shortage of fuel because supplies of fuel will be able to enter the port during that time. iReport: List of missing, found | Are you there? One concern with cross-border traffic is the unauthorized departure of Haitian children. Charities and aid groups have said in recent days that they are concerned about the danger of child trafficking after the earthquake. Groups including Save the Children and World Vision have called for a halt to adoptions, saying many children may appear to be orphaned but in fact have simply been separated from their families. ""If children must be evacuated from Haiti because their protection needs cannot be met in country, the evacuation must be carefully documented, the children must be registered with the proper authorities, and all efforts must be made to reunify them with family before any adoption proceedings are considered,"" the U.S.-based Women's Refugee Commission said. The number of unaccompanied children needing support is greater than the capacity to respond, the U.N. office said. Authorities are working with unaccompanied children who are being released from hospitals, it said. There are now 47 hospitals, 11 mobile clinics and two floating hospitals -- from the United States and Mexico -- in and around Port-au-Prince. One of those floating hospitals is the USNS Comfort, a U.S. Navy ship just off the Haitian coast. Capt. James Ware, the commanding officer, oversees a team of 80 doctors, including 24 surgeons and 140 nurses. Ware said Friday that the hospital had received about 240 patients over 36 hours. In the next few days, he said, he expected the ship to treat about 150 patients a day. About 609,000 people have also been left homeless in and around the capital of Port-au-Prince, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius was in a ""loving and caring relationship"" with Reeva Steenkamp, the girlfriend he is accused of murdering, the sprinter's agent testified Tuesday. Pistorius involved his girlfriend in conversations about business and wanted her to travel with him so she could see what his life was like, Peet van Zyl said on the stand at the athlete's murder trial. He was excited about taking her to a concert by Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli, the agent said. The double amputee sprinter is on trial for killing Steenkamp in February last year. He admits killing her but says he mistook her for a burglar and thought he was defending himself. The prosecution says the two had an argument and he killed her intentionally. Van Zyl described the sprinter as ""hypervigilant"" and ""always fidgety,"" saying Pistorius once grabbed his arm when they heard a bang on a street in New York, and liked to sit where he could see the exits when they went to restaurants. But he denied that the athlete was prone to outbursts of anger. Van Zyl had lost his temper more often than Pistorius during the years they worked together, he said. The main Pistorius defense lawyer, Barry Roux, questioned van Zyl Tuesday morning before handing him over to prosecutor Gerrie Nel. Nel, an aggressive, sometimes sneering interrogator, attacked van Zyl from the outset, pressing the agent to say part of his job was to deal with Pistorius' bad press. But Nel did not question van Zyl for long before requesting an adjournment for the rest of the day. He said he was not expecting van Zyl as a witness and needed more time to prepare to question him about the athlete's character. The hearing concluded for the day before lunch and will resume on Wednesday for its 36th day. Screams like a woman? Van Zyl took the stand after an acoustics expert, Ivan Lin, was cross-examined about sounds on the night of killing. Some neighbors have described hearing a woman's screams between shots the night Steenkamp died, which the prosecution suggests was the argument that led to her death. But the defense has argued that Pistorius sounds ""like a woman screaming"" when he's anxious, and says it was his screams that ear-witnesses heard. On the stand for the defense Monday, Lin said ""typically"" one can differentiate between male and female screams, but not without exception. Nel pressed him on the point but made little headway on Tuesday. The prosecutor did get Lin to concede that state witnesses could have heard screaming from the Pistorius house on the night of the killing from their homes up to 177 meters (580 feet) away. Mentally sound . The trial restarted Monday after a monthlong break when Pistorius was evaluated by mental health experts at the prosecution's request. They found he was not mentally incapacitated when he shot and killed Steenkamp. According to the findings by an independent panel of doctors, Pistorius did not suffer from a mental defect or mental illness at the ""time of the commission of the offense that would have rendered him criminally not responsible of the offenses charged."" The report added that ""Mr. Pistorius was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act."" Had the doctors deemed Pistorius mentally incapacitated during the shooting, the trial would have immediately ended in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness. Verdict . At the trial's conclusion, Judge Thokozile Masipa will have to decide whether Pistorius genuinely made a mistake or killed Steenkamp intentionally. If she does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder, she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to at least 15 years in prison and possibly life. South Africa does not have the death penalty. If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps. A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion. Read more: Judge sends Pistorius for psychiatric tests .

He broke him early in the first set and was never headed, admitting afterwards that reaching the final of the prestigious event was one of his ambitions. ""I always wanted to be in a final out here, stepping on there on Sunday means a lot to me, especially out here,"" he told the ATP Tour website. ""I don't know why I have such a strong intuition about this tournament. It has always been one of the biggest events for me, for some reason. There's nothing better than to be in the final.""

Stepanek, who beat home hope Andy Murray in the second round, lost a narrow first set tiebreaker 9-7 and a single break of his service was enough to see Lopez home in one hour 42 minutes. Meanwhile Federer, back on his favorite grass, needed just 73 minutes to fend off Nishikori 6-3 7-6 and will be bidding for his seventh title at the Gerry Weber Open tournament.

The parliamentarian provides nonpartisan advice to help lawmakers understand the ins and outs of the legislative process. It's up to the Senate parliamentarian, Alan Frumin, to advise lawmakers on what can and cannot be passed via reconciliation, which requires a simple majority of 51 votes instead of 60 to advance legislation in the Senate. With reconciliation a likely step on the path to health care reform, expect to see Frumin in the headlines for a while. Keeper of the stationery . The keeper of stationery, like many positions on Capitol Hill, dates back to the early days of Congress. Back then, the secretary of the Senate was hired to buy papers and pens and ink for lawmakers, Ritchie said. Clerks were hired based on penmanship since everything was handwritten. The secretary of the Senate still has a stationery room, which is looked after by the keeper of stationery. Today, that room is more of an office supply shop, where lawmakers' staff can pick up computer paper and ink cartridges. The House and Senate each have similar stores, which are not open to the public. Cloakroom personnel . The cloakrooms are off the floor of the House and Senate chambers, and they are similar to what other offices call break rooms. Lawmakers might work on cutting deals in the cloakroom, or they might just kick back and watch television. Each party has its own cloakroom. Floor assistants and cloakroom attendants are among those who work in the rooms. Their duties include alerting lawmakers when votes are coming up, telling them whether the chamber will be open on a snow day and working with pages to deliver messages. Senate hair care staff . Hairstylists have worked on Capitol Hill since the 19th century, Ritchie said. Although haircuts were free for lawmakers when the shop first opened, that's not the case anymore. In addition to hairstylists, the Senate hair care staff also includes a shoe shiner and a manicurist. The barber shop and beauty parlor are open to the public. Reading clerk . The reading clerk, also known as the legislative clerk, reads the titles of bills. In the Senate, the clerk also calls the role when votes take place. The reading clerk is also the lucky person who has the task of reading aloud 1,000-plus-page bills when lawmakers request it. Gift shop workers . The Senate and House each have their own gift shops. There are also two gift shops at the Capitol Hill Visitor Center. These shops employ gift shop assistants, sales associates and shop directors. Architect of the Capitol . The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for the upkeep and the preservation of landmarks throughout Washington, including the Capitol, Visitor Center, Supreme Court, Library of Congress and U.S. Botanic Garden. The agency employs 2,500 workers. Sergeant-at-arms . The House and Senate each have a sergeant-at-arms, who handles security for lawmakers, their staff and visitors. The sergeants, along with the Architect of the Capitol, serve on the Capitol Police Board. The House sergeant-at-arms introduces the president at the State of the Union address. When the office of the House doorkeeper was abolished in 1995, the House sergeant-at-arms absorbed some of that position's duties, along with the clerk of the House and the chief administrative officer. Subway operators . There are multiple subways that run to the Capitol from lawmakers' office buildings. A driver operates the one from the Rayburn House Office Building. The Senate has three office buildings. Subways running from the Hart and Dirksen office buildings are mechanically operated. The original Russell Senate Office Building still has an operator on its subway, Ritchie said. The subways shuffle lawmakers from their offices to the House and Senate floor. Maintenance staff . ""Anything you need to have an office going, we've got people doing it here,"" Ritchie said. From carpenters to book binders to upholsterers to picture framers to light bulb changers -- the maintenance workers try to counter the wear and tear of the millions of people who visit the Capitol.","Capitol Hill ""like a little city full of people,"" Senate historian says .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal court ruled Friday that the evidence supporting an alleged causal link between autism and a mercury-containing preservative in vaccines is unpersuasive, and that the families of children diagnosed with autism are not entitled to compensation. Special masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims released more than 600 pages of findings after reviewing three test cases and finding all the claims wanting. ""Petitioners' theory of vaccine-related causation is scientifically unsupportable,"" wrote Special Master Patricia Campbell-Smith in her conclusion about William P. Mead, whose parents, George and Victoria Mead, had brought one of the suits. ""In the absence of a sound medical theory causally connecting William's received vaccines to his autistic condition, the undersigned cannot find the proposed sequence of cause and effect to be logical or temporally appropriate. Having failed to satisfy their burden of proof under the articulated legal standard, petitioners cannot prevail on their claim of vaccine-related causation."" In the second test case, Special Master George L. Hastings Jr. wrote, ""The record of this case demonstrates plainly that Jordan King and his family have been though a tragic ordeal,"" referring to the minor, whose parents, Fred and Mylinda King, had brought suit. ""After studying the extensive evidence in this case for many months, I am convinced that the opinions provided by the petitioners' experts in this case, advising the King family that there is a causal connection between thimerosal-containing vaccines and Jordan's autism, have been quite wrong."" The special master italicized the last two words. ""Nevertheless, I can understand why Jordan's parents found such opinions to be believable under the circumstances."" ""In this case, the evidence advanced by the petitioners has fallen far short of demonstrating such a link,"" he said. In the final test case, Special Master Denise K. Vowell wrote of Colin R. Dwyer, a minor, that his parents, Timothy and Maria Dwyer, ""have not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Colin's condition was either caused or significantly aggravated by his vaccinations. Thus, they have failed to establish entitlement to compensation and the petition for compensation is therefore denied."" Congress set up the special judicial forum, sometimes called the ""vaccine court,"" in 1986 to address claims over vaccine safety. Rebecca Estepp, who attended the hearings and said her 12-year-old son, Eric, has been diagnosed with autism she blames on vaccine, described herself as ""devastated"" with the rulings, but not surprised. ""The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court,"" she said in a telephone interview from her home in Poway, California, about 20 miles north of San Diego. ""You have government attorneys defending a government program using government-funded science before government judges. Where's the justice in that?"" Tom Powers, a Portland, Oregon-based lawyer for the families involved, said his clients were disappointed. ""All three families are committed to following the appeals process, and pursuing that avenue to get justice and compensation for their kids,"" he said. The special masters' decisions are subject to review by judges in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Within the next 30 days, attorneys for the families will ask the claims court judges to review the decisions and rule that the children are, in fact, entitled to compensation. After government lawyers have a chance to respond to the motions for review, the judges will schedule oral argument and hearings, probably in the summer, Powers said. Though Friday's decisions do not end the legal battle, Dr. Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was optimistic. ""Parents should take heart in this decision and continue to immunize their children with the confidence that they are the safest, most effective way to protect against dangerous diseases,"" the pediatrician said. ""It's time to move forward and look for the real causes of autism,"" said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation. ""Our children deserve real answers and at this point doing more and more studies of vaccines, when the science is so clear, would be allowing politics to triumph over science."" The three test cases represented thousands of children who have autism and whose parents contend their disorder was triggered by an early childhood vaccination. The vaccines contained thimerosal, a mercury-derived compound the parents say helped bring on regressive autism, in which normally developing children suddenly exhibit learning disorders and behavioral problems, typically between ages 1 and 2. The theory that vaccines or thimerosal can cause autism is rejected by most medical experts, including the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Multiple scientific studies also have failed to prove a link. Thimerosal was removed from infant vaccines in 1999. In February 2009, the court's special masters concluded that the evidence supporting a link between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, or MMR, combined with thimerosal-containing vaccines, was also unpersuasive. This week, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal of parents who say that a range of vaccines administered to their child caused serious health problems. The justices on Monday agreed to decide whether drug makers can be sued outside the vaccine court. The lawsuit was brought by the parents of Hannah Bruesewitz, a girl from the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, area. The parents said she was healthy as an infant in 1992 when given a series of DPT shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus. After the third series, according to court briefs, the child began having seizures and became disabled. Now a teenager, Hannah continues to suffer what is described as ""residual seizure disorder."" The Bruesewitzes alleged Wyeth Laboratories failed to adequately warn them and other parents of the risks associated with the vaccine. The vaccine court rejected the initial claim, so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in other federal courts. A federal appeals court eventually ruled for Wyeth, now owned by Pfizer Inc., concluding all design-defect claims were barred under statute. Despite that victory, the company urged the high court to hear the case, saying it seeks final resolution on the broader legal questions. The Obama administration also urged review and is supporting the company and the federal law in question. Wyeth and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe, but side effects can occur in rare cases.

"(CNN) -- Venus Williams could not find the energy and inspiration which had seen her defeat sister Serena in the last four as she slipped to a straight sets defeat to Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska in the final of the Rogers Cup in Montreal Sunday. Maybe the effort of three straight three-set matches took its tool, but the seven-time grand slam champion was rarely a factor as she lost 6-4 6-2 in 81 minutes at the hard court tournament. ""I am sorry. I fell a little short. I didn't have as much to give as I would have liked,"" Venus said. She took the opening game of the match before Radwanska went on a run of four straight to take an early stranglehold. Williams broke back for 4-3, but the third seed rounded out the set 6-4. The pair exchanged breaks at the start of the second, but Radwanska broke again in the fifth game and did not drop another to claim her 14th WTA career title. The Wimbledon 2012 runner-up to Serena Wlliams was delighted by her victory and a check for $467,000 for the win. ""Everything was working for me today,"" she said. Consolation for Williams is that she will improve her current ranking of 26 after her fine run at the tournament and an earlier title in 2014. Later Sunday, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga completed a triumphant week at the men's Rogers Cup in Toronto with a straight sets victory over Roger Federer. The Frenchman had beaten world number one Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray on his way to the title match at the Masters 1000 tournament and Federer went the same way in a 7-5 7-6 victory. The 13th seed had also gone into this match as the underdog, with Federer looking for a remarkable 300th win at this level. But a single break after a pair of errors from Federer saw him wrap up the opener. The second set went with service with Tsonga wrapping up the tiebreaker 7-3 to win his second Masters 1000 crown and to climb back into the top 10 of the world rankings. Tsonga had not won a title in 18 months after struggling with injury and loss of form, but has returned to his best with a vengeance ahead of the U.S. Open later this month.","Agnieszka Radwanska wins Rogers Cup in Montreal .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona has appointed Luis Enrique as the club's new manager just days after losing out on the La Liga title. Enrique, who has resigned from his role at Celta Vigo following a successful season in charge, returns to the club where he starred as a player between 1996 and 2004. The 44-year-old has signed a two-year deal and replaces Tata Martino, who left the club after just one season at the helm. In a statement, the club confirmed that Enrique was appointed following an endorsement from sporting director, Andoni Zubizarreta. Barcelona endured a disappointing season, failing to retain its league title and crashing out of the Champions League following a defeat by Atletico Madrid. Atletico also pipped Barca to the league title by securing a final day draw at Camp Nou on Saturday. Martino's side was also beaten by arch-rival Real Madrid in last month's Copa del Rey final. His departure, which came following Saturday's draw, raised few eyebrows following a reign perpetuated by rumors of unrest within the camp. The attention will now turn to Enrique, who guided Celta to an impressive ninth place finish in La Liga. Enrique, who arrived at the club for the first time as a player in 18 years ago following a move from Real Madrid, became a huge favorite with the club's supporters. He won two league titles, two Spanish Cups, a European Cup Winners Cup and a European Super Cup during his eight years at the Camp Nou. Enrique played 300 games for the club, scoring 109 goals and captained the side between 2002-2004 before retiring. In 2008, the former Spain international coached Barcelona B, winning promotion in his second season in charge before leaving to take over at Italian side Roma three years later. At Roma, he guided the club to a seventh place finish in Serie A and into the semifinals of the Italian Cup. He left his post after citing fatigue. The confirmation of Enrique's appointment came shortly after Lionel Messi signed a new deal with the club, which reportedly takes his net annual salary to $27.4 million. Messi agreed the deal last Friday but put pen to paper on the new contract Monday. The Argentina striker has had a lean season by his own impossibly high standards, but has still scored 28 La Liga goals in his 30 games. Messi joined the Catalans in 2000 at the age of 13 and has gone on to win 21 trophies with Barca, including six La Liga titles and three European Champions League crowns. The 26-year was also voted World Player of the Year in four successive seasons, between 2009 and 2012, and will be one of the biggest names at the World Cup in Brazil. Barcelona has also announced the signing of Borussia Mönchengladbach goalkeeper Marc-André Ter Stegen, who is expected to become the club's first-choice next season.","Luis Enrique appointed new manager of Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Scientists have unearthed a giant virus more than 30,000 years old from the frozen soil in a remote region of Siberia. While this ancient virus is harmless to people, the scientists behind the discovery warn that the discovery suggests that the thawing of permafrost in polar regions, as a result of either climate change or mining, could bring threats to human health. The ancient virus, named Pithovirus sibericum, infects amoebas, not humans or animals. It survived in the Siberian ice from a period when woolly mammoths and saber-tooth cats roamed the earth. The scientists found it in the Chukotka Autonomous Region, the most northeasterly region of Russia, which lies across the Bering Strait from Alaska. Its discovery was reported by the researchers, from French and Russian institutions, in an article published this week by the U.S. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Reemergence . The discovery of Pithovirus ""shows how incomplete our understanding of microscopic biodiversity is when it comes to exploring new environments,"" France's National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) said. And the potentially bad news: the reemergence of other viruses ""is no longer the domain of science fiction,"" the center said. These include viruses that were long considered eradicated, such as smallpox, whose replication process is similar to that of Pithovirus, according to the scientists. ""This is an indication that viruses pathogenic for human or animals might also be preserved in old permafrost layers, including some that have caused planet-wide epidemics in the past,"" said Jean-Michel Claverie, one of the study's co-authors. Far more genes . Scientists were previously aware of two distinct families of giant viruses, Megaviridae and Pandoraviridae. This latest discovery establishes the existence of a third family. Giant viruses contain far more genes than common viruses. Pithovirus has about 500 genes, dwarfing viruses like those that cause AIDS or influenza, which contain about 10 genes, according to Claverie. But Pithovirus is in turn comfortably eclipsed by a previously discovered giant virus, Pandoravirus, which contains roughly 2,500 genes.","Researchers find a giant virus that survived in the Siberian permafrost .

"(CNN) -- Severe flooding across Serbia has prompted the evacuation of at least 16,300 people -- including 1,100 whisked away on helicopters -- the government said Saturday. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry confirmed there have been at least 15 deaths in Serbia and another five in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. Unconfirmed reports put the numbers even higher. It's the worst flooding Serbia has seen since the country began keeping records 120 years ago, according to meteorologists. The catastrophic weather has prompted authorities to declare a state of emergency in Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to a government statement. Bosnian authorities say the flooded town of Maglaj received the average rainfall for a two-month period in less than two days. Speaking at a press conference, Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said that the situation in his country is ""difficult,"" but that Serbia is prepared for the next wave of floods. More rising waters are expected Sunday evening near Sabac, a city in western Serbia near the Sava River. Vucic said that Sabac is well fortified and that authorities had done ""everything that could be done."" The Prime Minister pointed out that a dam 7.3 meters tall (24 feet) has been erected, but that the current level of the Sava River is over 6.3 meters -- a historic high. The river is expected to rise. He warned that it is difficult to predict what will happen if the river reaches 6.8 meters, or slightly more than 22 feet. Rescuers in the hard-hit town of Obrenovac, 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) southwest of Belgrade, have recovered the first bodies of flood victims, according to Vucic. He expressed concern over how many may eventually be found once waters subside. Authorities estimate that 90% of the town has been flooded. The Prime Minister thanked the many countries that have already come to Serbia's aid. He was especially grateful to members of the Russian special forces, highlighting one member who swam 200 meters in cold water to save several people. According to Finance Minister Dusan Vujovic, more than 10,000 troops have already been involved in rescue and assistance operations.","Worst flooding the region has seen in at least 120 years .

"(CNN) -- IOC president Thomas Bach has condemned the ""despicable attack"" on Volgograd which has raised fresh fears about security at the forthcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi. At least 31 people have been killed in two separate explosions Sunday and Monday within the space of 24 hours, with the main railway station and a trolleybus targeted. Volgograd is 690km from the Black Sea resort where the Winter Games is due to begin on February 7, but it is a public transport hub where people traveling to Sochi by rail would likely use. Bach, set to take charge of his first Games since being elected to the top job at the International Olympic Committee in October, issued a strongly-worded statement Monday in reaction to the bombings. ""This is a despicable attack on innocent people and the entire Olympic Movement joins me in utterly condemning this cowardly act. Our thoughts are with the loved ones of the victims,"" Bach said. ""I have personally written to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, to express our condolences to the Russian people and our confidence in the Russian authorities to deliver safe and secure Games in Sochi. ""I am certain that everything will be done to ensure the security of the athletes and all the participants of the Olympic Games. ""Sadly terrorism is a global disease but it must never be allowed to triumph.

""The many declarations of support and solidarity from the international community make me confident that this message of tolerance will also be delivered by the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi."" Russian authorities have reacted to the attacks by stepping up security at major train stations and airports. No group has to date claimed responsibility for the attacks, but suspicion has fallen on Chechen separatist groups. The leader of one of the groups, Doku Umarov, has ordered rebels to target civilians outside of Russia's North Caucasus and to disrupt the Winter Games.

"(CNN) -- The fight to point blame in the deadly last voyage of the HMS Bounty is headed for federal court. Family members of deckhand Claudene Christian, one of two Bounty crew members who died in the sinking, filed a $90 million civil lawsuit this week against the owners of the three-masted square-rigger, which appeared in several Hollywood films, including the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. The suit alleges the Bounty was unseaworthy and its captain -- Robin Walbridge -- was negligent when he set sail with his crew of 15 as Hurricane Sandy steamed toward the U.S. Eastern Seaboard. Walbridge was also lost in the shipwreck. His body was never recovered after the vessel took on water in stormy seas and sank on October 29. Wind gusts above 100 mph and waves as high as 30 feet flipped Bounty on its side, tossing Walbridge and his 15 shipmates into the Atlantic off the coast of North Carolina. Fourteen crew survived. The lawsuit accuses the Bounty's owners of ""intentionally placing the lives of the crew at extreme risk for the sole purpose of financial gain."" It also provides detailed examples of allegedly poor maintenance and inadequate crew training, which it says contributed to the sinking and Christian's death. ""As much as I would like to speak my mind, I can not make any comments as of yet,"" wrote Bounty owner Robert Hansen in an e-mail to CNN. Arguably the best-known traditionally rigged wooden 18th-century replica ship in the world, the Bounty belonged to the New York-based HMS Bounty Organization, which sailed it from port to port as a tourist attraction. Christian, a 42-year-old former teen beauty queen, had been hired as a Bounty deckhand just five months before. It was her first job aboard a ship. The Bounty was a replica of the 18th-century British vessel that was rocked by an infamous mutiny. Christian, drawn by the romance and adventure surrounding wooden sailing ships, claimed to be a descendent of Bounty mutineer Fletcher Christian. During her college days, she cheered for the University of Southern California as one of its Song Girls. Christian also launched a doll-making company. At one point, she co-owned a bar in Los Angeles. The idea of crewing on a tall ship dawned on her after she visited a replica of Christopher Columbus' famous wooden vessel La Nina. Her shipmates aboard the Bounty grew to like her always upbeat personality. Read more about Christian and the final voyage of the Bounty . The lawsuit comes three months after U.S. Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board launched hearings aimed at learning what contributed to the sinking. Crew members testified that Walbridge knowingly set sail toward Hurricane Sandy from New London, Connecticut, en route to St. Petersburg, Florida. He's featured in a YouTube video where Walbridge explains how to ""get a good ride"" out of a hurricane, by sailing ""as close to the eye of it as you can."" ""We chase hurricanes,"" Walbridge said in the video. Multiple witnesses also testified that the captain chose to sail knowing there was rot infesting the key parts of the Bounty, including the ships wooden ribs -- known as the frames. Hansen, representing the Bounty's owners, declined to testify at the hearing, pleading their Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. The storm that broke records -- and hearts . The lawsuit alleges the owners and Walbridge committed ""negligence"" and acts of ""reckless conduct"" by ""ignoring unmistakable evidence of rot and deterioration"" and the ""clear adverse consequences of concealment rather than proper corrective repairs."" Two days after leaving Connecticut, heavy seas from the approaching storm increased seawater leaking into the ship. The rising water began to overwhelm Bounty's pumps. Later, the ship's generators and engines failed, leaving the Bounty at the mercy of Sandy's fury. Built in 1960 as the featured prop in the Marlon Brando film ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" the 108-foot vessel had been overhauled in 2001 and again in 2006. The vessel wasn't licensed to carry passengers out to sea, which allowed operators to avoid requirements reserved for higher classified ships -- including a sometimes expensive, time-consuming Coast Guard hull inspection every two years. The ship's classification also allowed it to hire less experienced crew to serve in officer positions. The Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board are expected to issue final reports on their investigation as soon as the end of the year.

"(CNN) -- Last Friday, I was in Uganda's Constitutional Court as a member of the legal team that persuaded its judges to overturn our country's inhumane anti-homosexuality law. Today, I am in Washington for the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit ""Investing in the Next Generation"" with a message: Invest in human rights in Africa. It's hard to believe that African leaders and some development experts still debate whether human rights is a ""Western concept"" and whether countries can grow without human rights. African leaders have been too eager to advance their own economic and security agendas without consideration of the rights of their citizens. Let's take the record of my country, Uganda, and its Anti-Homosexuality Act. This law codified rampant discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, who were targeted by police and arrested, detained for prolonged periods, extorted and blackmailed by those who should have been guaranteeing their rights under our constitution. The law stipulated punishments of up to life in prison for gay people engaging in sex and long sentences for ""attempted homosexuality"" or even promotion of it. Although the Constitutional Court invalidated the anti-homosexuality law, it did so on a procedural point, not on the grounds of human rights. And a law that criminalizes sex acts ""against the order of nature"" dating back to colonial times is still on the books. We do not know if the Ugandan parliament will vote on this law again in a way that would pass scrutiny by the Constitutional Court. The fight might not be over. But if supporters of this law reintroduce it, or if it is appealed, we will fight it every step of the way again. The Ugandan government's intolerance of homosexuality created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation for nonprofit Ugandan organizations as well. It recently ordered the well-respected Refugee Law Project at Makerere University to suspend its work over the ridiculous allegation that it was promoting homosexuality and lesbianism. Even health and development projects funded by the United States have not been spared. In April, the Ugandan police raided and closed the Walter Reed Research Clinic in Kampala because it works in partnership with the LGBT community to combat HIV-AIDS and was ""training youths in homosexuality."" Sadly, human rights violations in Uganda are not limited to the government's prejudicial and irrational treatment of LGBT people. For instance, our constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, guarantees freedom of assemblyâ€”but in practice, the Ugandan government restricts this right. In recent years, my country's police have used violence more and more frequently against opposition protesters, going as far as breaking up public meetings and arresting and intimidating pro-democracy activists. This trend is only likely to increase with the enactment of the new Public Order Management Act. This law grants even more power to the Ugandan police to regulateâ€”and in practice, to stifleâ€”public assemblies and demonstrations, with no legal recourse for the protesters. I love my country, Uganda, and don't mean to focus on it unfairly. One need only look to recent excesses in Nigeria and Zimbabwe to gain a broader view. Our leaders in Africa selectively demonstrate their support for human rights, often when the continent is reminded of its obligations under international and regional human rights treaties. This limited conception of human rights so often means that unpopular people and ideas find themselves attacked and abused. In Uganda and across the continent, civil society organizations are looking to African leaders and the United States to join us in making history. The summit's website accurately describes Africa as ""one of the world's most dynamic and fastest growing regions."" We are all proud of that, and understand that the summit must address crucial issues of economic development. But to make this summit truly historic, the United States and African nations must work together to promote democracies rooted in national constitutions and human rights, committed to protecting the dignity of all their citizens.","President Obama holds first-ever U.S.-Africa summit in Washington this week .

The black and white aerial footage, which Iran claims was from a RQ-170 spy plane, was aired by Iranian news agencies and placed on YouTube. Iran said it downed the drone on December 4, 2011, near Kashmar in the country's northeast, some 225 kilometers (140 miles) from the border with Afghanistan. At the time, U.S. officials acknowledged that the drone was missing and President Barack Obama asked Iran to return it. Iranian military officials vowed not to return the plane. In December 2012, Iran's navy claimed that it had captured another U.S. drone, after it entered Iranian airspace over the Persian Gulf. However, a U.S. defense official, who could not be named because the official was not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN that whatever the Iranians claim to have, it is not an actively operating U.S. Navy drone.","Incident reportedly took place during military maneuvers in southern Iran .

"(CNN) -- Father, son, husband of a Spice Girl, fashion icon, role model, sporting ambassador. It is sometimes easy to forget that David Beckham was ever a midfielder of the highest caliber with more than 100 appearances for England. He wore a sarong, a headscarf, nail varnish, adorned his body with tattoos and changed his expertly coiffured hair-do practically every week. He spoke sparingly and, when he did, it was with a high-pitched, slightly effeminate whine. And, as far as anyone could tell, his female partner seemed to make all the important decisions. And yet his masculinity was never in doubt. Can you bend it like Beckham? Prove it! Send us your videos . In the 1990s, we called Beckham a New Man, or a metrosexual. He was evidently straight, but never aggressive or even assertive in a traditional masculine way. In fact, he seemed mild-mannered. He dressed stylishly -- if a little too flamboyantly for many tastes -- groomed himself painstakingly and appeared unembarrassed when asked about his formidable following of gay fans. There was a shimmering complexity, a quiet elegance, and perhaps even a sly wit about Beckham. Footballers, as the world knew them, were hard-boiled characters, who liked a drink and a good play up, especially after a game. Their reputation was hewn from the granite of working class tradition -- men were tough and affectless. We can barely imagine the reaction in the locker room when Beckham unpacked moisturizer, bronzer, and assorted hair products from his kit bag. In the late 1990s, when he first surfaced, only Beckham could get away with it. After all, he enjoyed the adoration of women all over the world, had a pop star girlfriend and soon-to-be wife, and had to fend off advertisers who clamored for his endorsement services. He was a man with the world at his feet. He still is. Today, cultural history is unimaginable without Beckham -- because he helped change that history. He slew the image of the unrelentingly macho sport hero and emerged heroically as the world's first all-purpose celebrity athlete. A symbol of a new masculinity. And still we have to remind ourselves: Beckham was never rated as the best footballer in the world. And, far from being a hellraiser or a serial womanizer like many a notorious sports figure, he was squeaky clean. Well, at least until 2004 when the News of the World tabloid alleged that he had an affair -- something he denied. Paradoxically, the alleged affair added rather than subtracted from his already iconic status, introducing a dash of devilry and rescuing Beckham from a kind of borderline piousness, and perhaps issuing a reminder that, despite all the affectations, his manhood was beyond doubt. So why is Beckham the game-changing celebrity athlete? There were two David Beckhams: one the flesh-and-blood mortal who kicked a ball around for a living, the other a character that existed independently of time and space -- a product of our imaginations. Everyone thought they knew Beckham and enjoyed a secret relationship with him. He was like a blank canvas. Had he espoused his own views, or aligned himself with great causes he would have spoiled it. But he was silent, giving interviews rarely -- and, I suspect, at Victoria's discretion. And while he stayed largely unknown, the Beckham mystique grew. When Beckham first entered the popular consciousness it was amid feelings of hate and revenge. Red-carded in a crucial England game against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup, Beckham was blamed for his team's exit. Effigies of him were burnt and he was forced to retreat. It's difficult to imagine the intensity of the loathing back then. Yet it was crucial in generating interest, even, passion. The sight, even the name of Beckham stirred up powerful feelings. Football fans may have despised him, but others were just curious. And they became more curious as Beckham defiantly refused to give interviews or make public appearances, save for at the occasional fashion launch or a party hosted by a rock star or designer. All this was very un-footballer-like and faintly unmanly. By the time Beckham and Victoria were married in 1999, interest in him had extended far beyond the football fraternity. His most devoted followers knew nothing of football. Unlike traditional sport fans, they were not interested in how he played: they were interested in him -- just Beckham. At the start of the 21st century, there was only an embryonic celebrity culture; the fascination we now have for people who make no material impact on our lives and, in many cases, had no accomplishments of note was a new and perplexing development. Fans knew famous sportsmen and women by their talents and achievements. Beckham was different, he was known for being Beckham and, in this sense, he was among the first generation of celebrities. Beckham's departure from football will not mean his disappearance. He will remain on our TV screens, in our magazines and on advertising hoardings the world over. But most significantly, he will remain in our imaginations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ellis Cashmore.","David Beckham's masculinity was never in doubt, writes Ellis Cashmore .

"(CNN) -- A conservative leader Friday laid the Republican Party's poor showing at the polls at the feet of moderates who, he argues, led the party away from its core principles. Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council says the GOP must return to conservative principles. Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council told CNN that conservatives need to take back control of the GOP if the party is to return to its winning ways. ""Moderates never beat conservatives. We've seen that in past elections,"" he said. Rejecting suggestions that the conservative movement was viewed as being out of touch with the electorate, Perkins says the Republican Party needs to go back to basics. ""It's a return to fundamental conservative principles that Ronald Reagan showed work and that people can be attracted to,"" Perkins said. Pointing to measures in California, Florida and Arizona barring same-sex marriage that passed Tuesday, Perkins said President-elect Barack Obama's election did not mean the country had embraced liberal social views. ""There was clearly no mandate to shift the country to the left on social issues,"" Perkins said. ""What Tuesday was, was a fact that people wanted change, and it's a rejection of a moderate view.""  Watch what went wrong in the McCain campaign » . David Keene of the American Conservative Union also said the idea of the Republican Party as the party of smaller government was undermined by the rapid increase in government spending over the last eight years. ""Republicans in Congress began to act like the Democrats they'd gotten rid of in the '90s. The president began to spend money like he was Lyndon Johnson, and the result was that voters began to get very upset,"" Keene said. ""So, yes, you have to go back to your basics."" Perkins' comments come after a post-election conservative conclave met at an undisclosed location in northern Virginia on Thursday. One of the prominent conservatives who attended the meeting, Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, said the group's goal was to rebuild the conservative movement in all 50 states. ""There's no one leader. There are many leaders,"" Norquist said. ""One of the things that the meeting decided is they wouldn't decide something. They won't endorse a candidate. It was the first meeting of a series of meetings of how do we structure, how do we increase building."" Perkins also said the meeting was meant to get the various wings of the conservative movement talking again. ""What has made the conservative movement strong is when you have social conservatives, fiscal conservatives and foreign policy conservatives working together,"" he said. ""This was the first step in what will be a long journey in rebuilding that communication and that common vision.""  Watch the fighting between the McCain and Palin camps » . Norquist said one of the lessons the conservatives took away from Tuesday night's results was that they focused too much on the presidential race and not enough on helping congressional candidates. In addition to Sen. John McCain, a Republican standard bearer, losing his bid for the White House, House Republicans will have at least 26 fewer seats in the next Congress, and Republicans could have a few as 40 seats in the Senate. ""As a national movement, a conservative movement, as a national Republican Party, it was certainly a mistake to focus on the presidency. It would be a mistake to focus on the elected officials in Washington,"" Norquist said. ""So we rebuild, not just in Washington, but in all 50 states.""

"(CNN) -- Is a woman's virginity worth $3.8 million? That's how much a 22-year-old from San Diego, California, said she has been offered through an auction she announced in September. Natalie Dylan, 22, said she has put her virginity up for auction through the Moonlite Bunny Ranch. The woman, who goes by ""Natalie Dylan,"" set up a private auction through the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, a legal brothel in Nevada. The auction has given her lots of ""business opportunities,"" she said. Her top bid comes from a 39-year-old Australian, but she has no immediate plans to settle the auction, she said in a recent interview with CNN. Some men may seek virgins because they want them as trophies, or desire purity. But as to why men would bid so much money on virginity, she said she has no answer. ""I honestly don't know what they see in it,"" she said. If you think Dylan's auction amounts to prostitution, she completely agrees. She also said she's not breaking any laws -- after all, prostitution in Nevada is legal. ""I feel people should be pro-choice with their body, and I'm not hurting anyone,"" she said. ""It really comes down to a moral and religious argument, and this doesn't go against my religion or my morals. There's no right or wrong to this.""  Watch for more on Dylan » . The idea that virginity has a high value harkens back to the days of early humans -- if a man has sex with a virgin woman, he knows for sure that her children will be his, anthropologists reason. In early civilizations, women were also considered the property of men, said Laura Carpenter, assistant professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. Through the 1950s in America, women were expected to remain virgins until marriage, Carpenter said. But with the availability of the pill and the IUD in the 1960s, combined with youth counterculture and gay rights movements, it became more common for women to engage in premarital sex, she said. Attitudes shifted toward the conservative side in the 1980s with the worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic, which made the stakes much higher for choosing a sex partner, especially for men. Abstinence-based education programs also took off around that time, with government support, she said. Today, about 95 percent of Americans have sex before they're 25, Carpenter said. But worldwide, virgin prostitutes can claim larger fees, certain cultures still attach larger dowries to virgin brides, and some women undergo reconstructive surgery to restore their hymens. In looking at Dylan's auction, ""To some extent it's not new. The new part is the Internet,"" Carpenter said. Dylan is not the first to hold a public sale for her sexual innocence. An Italian model reportedly had plans to sell her virginity for more than $1 million in September. Dylan said she was inspired by a report of a Peruvian woman who put her virginity up for sale. Some think Dylan's auction may be indicative of a shift in the way society treats sexuality. ""In a world that is teeming with brand messages, with sponsorships everywhere, intimacy is really just the next thing to go,"" said Jon Ray, a 24-year-old marketing consultant in Austin, Texas, and author of the blog Who is Jon Ray? Brett Austin Vanderzee, a 19-year-old student at Oklahoma Christian University who has pledged to stay a virgin until marriage, finds Dylan's actions somewhat appalling, but not shocking. ""It's kind of crazy, but I think it's the general direction that society has been heading in for a while,"" he said. ""We're becoming more accepting of things that normally would have been considered unwise."" Kiara Daines, a 17-year-old from Detroit, Michigan, said she's saving herself until marriage for personal and religious reasons. Both Vanderzee and Daines said they have endured teasing from their peers because of their choice to remain abstinent. Others say there's just too much hype around virginity. Martha Kempner, vice president for information and communications for the nonprofit Sexuality Information and Education Council of the U.S., said telling a young woman to stay""pure"" misses the point that sexuality will influence her long after she loses her virginity. ""By putting the emphasis there, [on virginity], we're actually devaluing the rest of women, the rest of her, and the rest of her sexuality for the rest of her life,"" she said. A recent study in the journal Pediatrics showed that religious teens who take virginity pledges are as likely to have sex before marriage as their religious peers, and less likely to use condoms or birth control when they become sexually active. Many people say losing one's virginity has different implications for men than women. While young women see the act as a symbolic giving of themselves, young men are more prone to want to get it over with and brag about it. Similarly, says Kempner, women are taught to keep themselves ""pure"" and help men exercise control, while there's a ""boys will be boys"" attitude around men. Do men really think that virginity is worth millions of dollars? Audacia Ray, a 28-year-old former sex worker from New York and author of ""Naked on the Internet: Hookups, Downloads and Cashing In on Internet Sexploration,"" is skeptical. She views Dylan's auction as a publicity stunt and doesn't anticipate she'll ""continue in the industry."" The importance of a woman's virginity may vary in different cultures, but generally there's not the high value there used to be, Ray said. ""It begins to be viewed more as a burden over time -- a burden in that losing virginity is an event, so that it has to somehow mean something, which is part of the reason why people are all up in arms about Natalie,"" she said. How do Dylan's friends and family feel? Dylan, who said she was raised in a conservative, non-Christian religious household, said although her mother doesn't agree with her, she still loves her as a daughter. Generally people have been supportive, Dylan said. ""I've talked with my exes, some different guys, and they understand it's just a business deal, and they know me, and they know I'm not this promiscuous girl. Honestly, even if I didn't do this, I'd always be the girl who thinks prostitution is OK,"" she said. ""I would always want to find a partner that can accept me for me.""","Natalie Dylan has put her virginity up for auction; says top bid is $3.8 million .

"London (CNN) -- We hear of tremors that shake, rattle and roll, but really cause no damage. Then there are the big quakes that hit offshore and cause a scare, but nothing more. So, will the ""earthquake"" of the fringe parties coming in first in France, the United Kingdom, Greece and others be a tremor, or will there be damage? That now depends on whether these parties can translate their momentum into seats in their national parties. In many countries the fringe parties already have seats. In Greece, Syriza should not even be called a fringe party, though they do occupy a space in the European parliament on the far left. I'm thinking more about UKIP. Call them populist, call them fringe -- the UK's other parties must respond. For the first time in more than a century, a third party In the UK has come in front in a national election. UKIP has already had the desired effect of changing the national debate in Britain. Both Labour and the ruling Conservatives have for the past few years had to defend their policies on Europe and immigration. The Conservatives have had to move closer to UKIP's anti-EU and strong anti-immigration stance. All this before a single ballot was cast. Now, UKIP will the largest number of MEPs from Britain. But unlike many other fringe parties in Europe, UKIP does not have one single seat in Westminster, the national parliament. Westminster is controlled by the three main parties, with a smattering of seats going to regional parties from the far reaches of the UK, and just one to the Green Party. UKIP would have to create a massive earthquake to pick up even one seat during next year's general election. But if you believe all the buzz from the elections, UKIP is about to form the next government. This reminds me of five years ago when the ""Rise of the Right"" in Europe was the screaming headline after the last EU Parliament election. Then most people forgot all about the EU Parliament, only for it to rise up the agenda when parliamentary expenses are criticized. The difference this time is perhaps, that the parties have gained more seats. They have the momentum. France's National Front has gone from 6% to 25% of the vote. UKIP has gone from 16% to 27%. Geert Wilders' PVV, in the Netherlands, appear to have lost votes, but not seats. They are predicted to retain their four seats. In Hungary, the Jobbik party remained steady with three seats, but has become the second biggest Hungarian party in the parliament. It should also be noted that the far, far right British party, the BNP, lost both of their MEPs and will have none in the new parliament. So, what about the left? In Greece, Syriza has gone from one seat to six. It has already polled well in national elections. Its leader Alexis Tsipras had put himself up at the next president of the European Commission, and, it must be said, has made himself a credible candidate to be a future prime minister of Greece. Now, it will be up to the centrist parties, in the European Parliament and in national parliaments to cobble together coalitions if they want to thwart the rise of fringe parties. But they cannot ignore the reasons these other parties continue to gain in popularity; austerity, unemployment, slow growth, immigration. You may or may not support these party's views, but they are tapping into a growing resentment in Europe. The new parliament will have more powers than its predecessors, but it remains to be seen if it also have a bigger voice.

"(CNN) -- Obsessed with keeping social order, China is now pushing to revise its laws in ways that will broaden police powers. The National People's Congress last week released a proposed revision of the Criminal Procedure Law that would allow the police to detain suspects for up to six months, at a location determined by the police, in cases that involve state security, terrorism or serious cases of corruption. The existing law requires the police to notify families of detainees within 24 hours. If revised, the law will allow police to secretly detain suspects, if they believed notifying relatives or a lawyer ""may hinder the investigation."" Critics say the proposed legislation could legitimize and potentially increase the number of secret detentions. ""(It) would give the security apparatus free rein to carry out 'disappearances' lawfully,"" said Sophie Richardson, China director of Human Rights Watch. ""Legalizing secret detention puts detainees at even greater risk of torture and mistreatment."" Nothing better illustrates such concerns than the case of Ai Weiwei, the high-profile artist who was detained by Chinese authorities in April as he was about to board a flight for Hong Kong. He was released in June -- after 81 days in police custody. He was later accused, but not formally charged, of tax fraud. His family denies the allegation and believes he was targeted due to his social and political activism. In a commentary published last week, Ai complained that ""the worst thing about Beijing is that you can never trust the judicial system."" Pu Zhiqiang, Ai's lawyer, says the proposed revision has grim implications. ""Ai Weiwei and I have been through secret detentions,"" Pu tells CNN. ""The police said they could do so because we're endangering national security. They've always resorted to such measures, but the revision will legalize them, which is horrifying."" ""While being held in an unspecified location, the detainee will be subject to mistreatment that might not be possible if he or she were in a proper detention center,"" says human rights researcher Joshua Rosenzweig. In recent days, China's mainstream media have run stories saying that the revisions were meant to improve protection of individual rights, and that police powers to carry out secret detention would be limited to exceptional cases. Xinhuanet.com, citing an article published by Huaxi City Paper, says the concerns and criticisms are ""due to misreading of the revision."" China's legislature has enjoined the public to comment on the proposed revisions until the end of September, before lawmakers formally take them up. On Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, many netizens are already giving the proposed revisions a thumbs-down. One ""laohu lushi"" writes: ""If you follow the logic of the new amendments, it would be secret detention, secret arrest, secret imprisonment followed by secret trial and eventually secret execution."" Yaozhuaide Fenghua asks, ""Who has the right to interpret 'suspected of crimes against national security and terrorism?' The officials. How much longer than 24 hours can secret detention exceed? The police decide too. They can extend your detention at their will a month, 10 years -- without telling your family!"" In fact, several revisions to the Criminal Law have been recently enacted, including a reduction in the number of non-violent economic crime punishable by death and the addition of some new criminal offenses, including drunk driving and endangering food safety and damaging the environment. ""It's fair to say that there are welcome changes,"" says Joshua Rosenzweig, citing examples such as excluding confessions or testimony obtained through torture. ""But the effectiveness of those changes will depend on how uniformly the provisions are enforced."" The past 25 years China has come a long way in improving the country's legal system and replacing ""renzhi"" (rule of men) with ""fazhi"" (rule of law). China has issued a plethora of laws and statutes covering everything from crimes to intellectual property infringement. The legal profession has regained its status. Chinese leaders see the need for such a legal system to manage China's intractable problems -- including endemic corruption, social injustice, wealth inequality and environmental degradation. Last March Premier Wen Jiabao warned that the party needed to tackle ""excessive concentration of power and lack of check on power,"" if China were to have a socially stable society. Yet, despite guarantees in the country's 1982 constitution that ""no organization of individual may enjoy the privilege of being above the law,"" critics complain that due process is still applied capriciously. In recent months, China's rulers have increasingly relied on criminal and administrative punishment to suppress growing demands for social justice, honest government and political freedom. Jittery over rising social unrest, they have taken tough measures to avert any kind of Middle East-style ""Jasmine Revolution,"" detaining dissidents, harassing their lawyers and supporters and tightening political control. Giving the police more power, critics say, is one such measure. Can the revisions be blocked? ""We will voice our opinions, but we are not optimistic it will make an impact,"" said Pu, Ai's lawyer. ""We'll try our best."" In China the end can always justify the means. Nowadays, the end is social and political control.","If revised, law will secret detention, if notifying relatives or lawyer will hinder probe .

"(CNN) -- Already dubbed a horse racing ""rock star,"" California Chrome's owners are laying plans to maximize the thoroughbred's rising profile ahead of the colt's bid to win the Belmont Stakes and the Triple Crown. Having won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes -- the other two legs of the Triple Crown -- California Chrome would become the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to achieve the ultimate feat in thoroughbred racing should he triumph in New York next month. Owners Steve Coburn and Perry Martin and their wives Carolyn Coburn and Denise Martin, have registered the name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, according to records filed on Thursday May 15. The move will give the owners license to use the name ""California Chrome"" on athletic apparel including shirts, pants, jackets, footwear, hats and caps. The three-year-old colt is arguably rapidly becoming the biggest racing sensation since the retirements of Frankel and Black Caviar. Frankel, who retired undefeated after winning all 14 of his races in October 2012, was estimated to be worth $168 million. Black Caviar, the mare who dominated Australian racing, retired in April 2013 after 25 consecutive victories and amassing nearly eight million dollars in prize money. She was featured on the front page of Australian Vogue magazine and was even voted as the country's top sportswoman. Only 11 of the 38 horses who have won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes have gone on to complete the dream treble with victory at the Belmont Stakes. The colt coasted to victory in Baltimore last Saturday to win the 139th Preakness Stakes -- and is now favourite for victory in the $1.5 million race in New York on June 7. California Chrome was born to a mare named Love the Chase, purchased by Coburn and Martin for $8,000 with a view to breeding. She was bred to the stallion Lucky Pulpit for a reduced fee of $2,000, the first breeding the novice pair had ever undertaken. Their offspring had earned Coburn and Perry more than $2.3 million in prize money before the Preakness, also chalking up wins at the Santa Anita Derby, San Felipe Stakes and California Cup Derby. After its Preakness success California Chrome became front page news after New York racing officials decided to allow the three-year-old to wear a breathing strip during the Belmont Stakes. His owners might not have allowed him to race without a strip, which the manufacturer says allows horses to breathe more freely and reduces the risk of bleeding in the lungs during heavy exertion. California Chrome has worn the strips during his last six wins, including those first-place finishes at the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.","Owners to trademark name ""California Chrome""

"Beijing (CNN) -- The foreign invasion of China's professional football league reached fever pitch this week with the announcement that former Chelsea forward Didier Drogba will play with the Shanghai Shenhua team next season. ""Drogba will be the highest profile player to join the China Super League,"" said Titan sports commentator Yan Qiang. ""He is going to get about 12 million euro (US$15 million) per season, the highest salary ever offered by China sport."" This continues the spending spree on foreign coaches and players by Chinese tycoons who have been acquiring sports teams for commercial and branding purposes. Last year reigning champions Guangzhou Evergrande imported a South American superstar who led the team to the championship. In May, the team pulled off another coup by securing the services of World Cup-winning Italian Coach Marcello Lippi. Bankrolled by Zhu Jun, a charismatic tycoon who co-owns Nine City, an online games company, Shenhua has been languishing near the bottom of the China Super League, with only three wins in 13 games. Chinese soccer: Vanity project or emerging superpower? Drogba, 34, will join his former Chelsea teammate Nicolas Anelka in the attacking line of the Shanghai team. Drogba says he decided to move to Shanghai to experience a new culture, promote Chinese football around the world, and further improve China-Africa relations. ""When Chelsea went to China last year, we had a great time and met some amazing fans,"" he wrote on his personal website. Football is considered the No. 1 spectator sport in China. Large crowds go to games and even larger audiences watch televised games featuring teams in professional leagues at home and in Italy, Germany and Britain. But interest in soccer has waned in recent years. This is partly due to the scandals that have plagued the ""beautiful game."" Last week, two former top officials of China's football association and four ex-members of the national team were convicted of corruption and match-fixing. They were sentenced to long prison terms. Poor performances by China's national teams haven't helped the cause either. China has repeatedly failed to qualify for the World Cup, prompting popular frustration and anger. In 2010, after the game that doomed China's chances of qualifying for the World Cup, a local newspaper ran a large, bold black headline, ""The National Soccer Team Lost Again. We Have Nothing to Say."" That year, China was ranked 84th in the world, just ahead of Mozambique. There has been little progress since then. In November last year, Team China was again eliminated from their 2014 World Cup qualifying group. Qualification for the World Cup remains an elusive goal, and the fans are not happy. I have seen Chinese soccer fans get angry when their team loses. In May 1985, minutes after an underdog Hong Kong team knocked China out of contention for the 1986 World Cup, hundreds of angry fans stormed onto the field and besieged the winning team -- and the home team. Outside the Beijing stadium, mobs went on a rampage, smashing vehicles and attacking journalists and diplomats. It was the worst sports riot in decades. Some China-watchers suggested it was a cathartic release of pent-up emotions over social and political controls and other complaints, coupled with an ugly display of jingoism. Others viewed it as evidence of simple fans' disappointment at their national team. With no home team to root for, Chinese fans have turned to other teams overseas—or to local teams featuring international idols. ""I bought Drogba to make supporters happy,"" Shenhua owner Zhu Jun wrote in his microblog. ""I believe his professionalism is not just on the field -- his other strengths will also have a great impact on other players. His values are many, he has an international vision as well as international recognition."" Fans hailed the move. ""It is a good thing for Chinese football and fans,"" wrote microblogger Jiaojiandefengzi. ""Big-shot players will definitely improve attendance in stadiums, boost ratings and bring considerable commercial benefits."" It is not a novel idea. In 1975, Brazilian super-hero Pele signed with the New York Cosmos and for years he gave the nascent professional soccer scene in the U.S. massive publicity and a significant boost in popularity. In 2007, David Beckham left Real Madrid to join Major League Soccer team LA Galaxy. Beckham, then 31, signed a multi-year, multi-million-dollar deal that included sponsorship and merchandising contracts. ""They worked in the sense that everyone made a lot of money, and they helped raise the profile of soccer in America and the U.S. league abroad,"" said Sports Illustrated writer Grant Wahl. ""There's no magic bullet, however. The U.S. league is still growing, but slowly,"" he added. But sports analysts wonder if importing big-name stars necessarily boost the teams commercially or competitively. Yan Qiang says it made sense for Guangzhou's Evergrande team. ""They were doing the Manchester City model,"" he explained. ""They made huge investment into the first team to gain instant result on the pitch and thus promote Evergrande's brand in China and Asia."" But Yan finds Shanghai's strategy off-target. ""Shanghai is a weak team, even though the club has some pedigree. Signing Drogba and Anelka would not make Shanghai a top team because it takes more than two world-class strikers to make a powerful team."" To give China's soccer a genuine boost, Yan said, ""the key is grassroots participation and youth development."" Jiang Yi, the managing editor of Sports Illustrated China, said importing big names ""is only good for Chinese sports if more big businesses and rich entrepreneurs wanted to get involved with sports in China. The reality is, however, that many of them don't want to."" Commercial goals aside, David Pan, formerly a professional basketball player in China and now a business professor at Prince Sultan University in Saudi Arabia, believes getting Drogba is largely a vanity project.  ""I think it is a stunt for Shanghai to reposition its city's image in China and the world in the post-Yao Ming era."" Pan likens it to the concept of bringing Formula 1 racing to Shanghai, which over the years has failed to gain popular and commercial appeal. ""I voiced my concern but they went ahead anyway,"" he said. ""Looking back, it's clear that the F1 race track was only for face-lifting of Shanghai.""

"(CNN)   -- Sasha drags bulging shopping bags onto a trishaw as he heads back to his hotel, ending another hectic day in Beijing. It's hectic but lucrative. He typifies the transient traders who come to Beijing on shopping expeditions, making hefty profits buying goods and reselling at home. Beijingers used to call them ""da daoye"" (big traders). Now they are simply ""hao pengyou"" (good friend) -- favored customers and trading partners. They congregate in Yabaolu, once a quiet Beijing neighborhood of mostly one-story courtyards, now a bustling trading hub dotted with shops and high-rise shopping malls. Much of China-Russia trade is done along their border crossings in northeastern China. In the Chinese capital it all happens in Yabaolu. ""Most of the people here are Russians buying clothes, leather, and furs,"" says a Ukrainian trader nicknamed Alex. ""They ship to all Slavic countries and Russia."" Here bargaining is tough but business is good. The most successful, traders say, can resell their items for 20 times their investment. Small wonder many Poles, Ukrainians, Yugoslavs and other East European traders make the long trip, too. Local Chinese make money as well. Pedicab drivers, speaking in pidgin Russian, offer to haul the traders for about $2 a ride. Local shop keepers and restaurant owners also make brisk business. The Chocolate -- an over-the-top nightclub that features scantily dressed Russian women dancing burlesque-style and a Russian band singing Russian and Western songs -- attracts a regular stream of Chinese and Russian customers. Over the years, I've observed trading in Yabaolu grow from small to big. Twenty years ago, traders loaded up scores boxes of goods -- mostly cheap clothes -- onto decrepit trailer trucks bound for train stations. Now, they employ shipping companies to move various goods that include silk dresses and shirts, fur jackets, toys and handbags. Vladimir Turkov is the general manager of Express Capital Trading, a company that exports steel from China to Russia. His 5-year-old company now employs 15 people in Yabaolu and has opened a Moscow branch to handle marketing and distribution. ""Everyone here got into the business around the same time,"" Turkov said, ""and because of that, we grew in success together. There was a need for products, and there still is."" Turkov's success is emblematic of the improved China-Russia ties that over the years have zigzagged between cooperation and conflicts. In the 1950s, China and the former Soviet Union were locked in a bear hug as firm Communist comrades. But in the 1960s, they turned into bitter foes, even fighting over a border dispute in 1969. Ties have since improved and Sino-Russian relations look more promising. They have settled border disputes, struck multi-million-dollar energy deals and have agreed to drop the U.S. dollar in favor of their own currencies to boost bilateral trade. Last year, China overtook Germany as Russia's largest trading partner. On a visit to St. Petersburg last June, Chinese president Hu Jintao told a gathering of business executives that China and Russia now seek to increase bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2015 and $200 billion by 2020. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union twenty years ago, Sino-Russian borders have seen a spike in traffic. Some 3 million people from China and Russia now visit each other's country annually. They include traders like Turkov and Sasha. Turkov attributes his success to good inter-personal relations between Chinese and Russians. ""We've all been in China for so many years,"" he says, ""We know how to interact with the Chinese. We may have differences but we also have much in common and have learned to live with our differences."" Turkov says he is not deterred by problems of bureaucracy, corruption and business conflicts that sometimes bedevil businessmen in China. ""If you play according to the rules, you won't get into trouble,"" he says. ""Many traders are only interested in coming to Beijing, buy products, and then go back to Russia to sell them,"" says Ekaterina Davydova, marketing manager at Express Capital Trading. But Russians like Turkov, she says, are in China for the long haul. ""We are helping the Chinese economy and our success is obviously dependent on the world economy,"" Turkov says. Will business remain bullish, given the economic downturn in the U.S. and Europe? ""Business is good, at least for now,"" he says, ""While you can't always foretell the future, I'm optimistic.""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- In a round-table meeting with government advisers and researchers of a government-run think tank on April 14, Premier Wen Jiabao enjoined them to listen to people's voices and relay these truthfully to top leaders. Wen's call to speak the truth comes at a time when the Chinese authorities are rounding up dissenters and muzzling whistle-blowers. A contradiction? Analysts say Wen's statement is designed to counter public scepticism and to warn officials against lying or pandering to higher ups. Others suggest it may just be part of Beijing's crisis management. A People's Daily commentary explains that Wen's appeal is meant to elicit accurate assessment of the situation so authorities can deal with problems effectively. ""I don't think it is in contradiction to the party's crackdown on dissents,"" says Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at Ohio University. ""Wen is trying to promote the legitimacy of the party, at least on the surface, whereas the dissidents want to destroy it."" In recent years, China has seen communist governments in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan swept by political turmoil called the ""color revolution"". Beijing has also watched authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and North Africa toppled by popular uprisings. The fall of these regimes has raised the spectre of a Chinese ""jasmine revolution."" That does not seem likely--yet. More than 30 years after Chairman Mao's death, the Communist regime has built one of the most successful authoritarian governments in the world, delivering double-digit economic growth while keeping its one-party grip. Still, China's leaders fear outbreaks of luan (chaos). ""They are not complacent,"" says a retired Communist Party official, who declined to be identified. ""They may disagree on the ways and means but they agree on one goal that anti-government acts will be nipped in the bud at all cost. They do not care what other people and countries will say."" They have good reasons to fret. The country is grappling with high inflation, endemic corruption, growing pollution concerns and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. They fear outbreak of ethnic strife in Tibet and Xinjiang, which experienced bloody street riots in 2008 and 2009, respectively. China's leaders have been trying to ease the pressure. ""Their calculation is that if the government can keep the economy growing and jobs and wages increasing, the legitimacy of the CCP will be maintained,"" says China-watcher Drew Thompson. ""But the challenges of growing social injustice, environmental damage and sustaining high economic growth will continue to haunt the leaders."" To avoid its own ""jasmine revolution,"" Beijing is taking firm measures to nip dissent in the bud. Police have detained scores of dissidents, including lawyers and prominent artist Ai Weiwei. Censors block Internet and social networking sites like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. At the same time, Chinese leaders try to project a sense of calm and normalcy. Party insiders say this tactic is known as neijin waisong--""tight inside, appearing lax from the outside."" At the press conference at the end of the annual session of China's legislature last month, I asked Premier Wen if he thought political reform was urgently needed so the leadership could better address the people's grievances and avert social unrest. The solution, he replied, was political reform--but reform that is gradual and led by the Communist Party. ""It's not easy to pursue political restructuring in a country of 1.3 billion people,"" he said. ""It needs to take place in an orderly way, under the leadership of the party."" Wen added: ""At present, I think the biggest danger lies in corruption, and eliminating the breeding ground of corruption needs systemic and structural reform."" Premier Wen is not necessarily pushing for radical political reforms, analysts say. Instead, says the retired Communist Party official, ""he advocates transparency and accountability so as to effectively solve problems, avoid chaos and consolidate the Party's leadership."" Wen's admirers say he is a reformist at heart. However, he sounds like a lonely voice among China's top leaders. Wu Bangguo, chairman of China's parliament and No. 2 in the party's hierarchy, in March ruled out the possibility of a multi-party democracy in China. Says Professor Wenfang Tang: ""The question is whether Wen's effort to promote inner-party democracy will have a spill-over effect on political opposition outside the party. His style is different from Hu Jintao's and other technocrats. He is emotional and immensely popular, likes to appear in front of cameras and create sound bites."" Some observers wonder if Wen's pronouncement is just part of a ""good cop, bad cop"" charade, with Wen playing the reform-minded leader and President Hu Jintao playing the hard liner. But there may be one other reason why the 69-year-old Wen feels freer to speak out in recent months. His two five-year terms will end in March 2013, after which he is expected to go into semi-retirement.","Premier Wen Jiabao tells government advisers and researchers: ""Speak the truth""

"(CNN) -- Channing Tatum's ""Magic Mike"" is back in action. On July 3, 2015, Tatum's stripper with a heart of gold will be back in theaters with a new story after winning over audiences in 2012's ""Magic Mike."" And instead of simply calling the sequel ""Magic Mike 2,"" Tatum and his team have conjured up a more memorable title: ""Magic Mike XXL."" Because of course. In the first ""Magic Mike,"" 33-year-old Tatum starred as the titular Mike, a construction worker and aspiring furniture designer by day and magical male stripper by night. Directed by Steven Soderbergh and including stars like Matthew McConaughey, Joe Manganiello and Alex Pettyfer, ""Magic Mike's"" summer 2012 debut was hot enough to earn $113 million domestically. According to Tatum, ""Magic Mike XXL"" will shift the action from Florida nightclubs to the road. ""This one will be a road trip movie,"" he told MTV on Sunday, when he was honored with the network's Trailblazer Award at the 2014 MTV Movie Awards. ""We don't want to make it a serious, slice-of-life movie. We want reality in it, but we don't want to make it some dark drama. There was some darkness in the last one, and I think it surprised people and shocked people. This one, we want there to be a lot of conflict and struggle, but we also want a s***-ton of fun. Just ridiculous stuff that you would never see in a movie."" Tatum is again writing and producing ""XXL"" with Reid Carolin, with Gregory Jacobs directing. As far as the cast, ""I think everyone's going to be back,"" Tatum said, although he cautioned that deals aren't set in stone. ""Magic Mike XXL"" will follow a very busy few years for Tatum. On the heels of success with 2012's ""21 Jump Street"" and ""Magic Mike,"" the actor has starred in no less than eight films, with three of them still to come this year.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- In Egypt, television is a big deal. This is especially true during Ramadan, when networks spend an estimated $140 million on TV programming -- a sum nearly matched by what's spent on advertising. ""Ramadan is still the biggest TV season. It's the Super Bowl of Arab TV, except that it goes for an entire month,"" explains Joseph Fahim, a prominent, Cairo-based film critic. It used to be that the plotlines for the myriad soaps and commercials that aired during Ramadan adhered to similar clichÃ©s: Family, unity, community, charity. Lately, with the region in upheaval, Ramadan television has acquired a distinct edge. Actor Amr Youssef is a TV and film actor whose Ramadan dramas have helped him shoot to national fame. Halfway through the Holy Month, he was filming ""Aad Tanazoly"", or ""Countdown"", in which he plays a university professor who is tortured in prison and ultimately driven to a life of terrorism. ""There's definitely been a radical improvement in (television) quality -- aesthetically, narratively, conceptually and especially acting-wise,"" says Fahim. Assir Yassin, a former soap star who has since broken into the film industry, found himself playing a similarly meaty role in last year's movie, ""Rags and Tatters"", in which he played a convict who escaped prison during the 2011 revolution. Though the unrest from that period forms the backdrop of a lot of film and TV coming out of Egypt, particularly during Ramadan, Yassin notes that people, not politics, are the main themes. ""(My movie) has a very subliminal message. (It's about) the people who went to the revolution, and those who didn't go. It's about the conditions of poverty and illiteracy. It was about people. Definitely it wasn't about revolution,"" he says. Many are taking advantage of Egypt's more experimental approach to subject matter during the holy month. Two years ago, J. Walter Thompson's Middle East division (JWT MENA) ran a series of humorous commercials for Vodafone Egypt featuring the country's most famous soap actors. In one, one of the actors gets hit by a Vodafone sign, and is left buried under the ruble. Vatche Keverian, the company's CEO, noted that Egypt makes it easier to try out new formats. ""In the Gulf region, you still don't really have the freedom to explore new ideas when it comes to Ramadan because it's still a bit more conservative. In cultures such as Egypt, you find a lot more engaging content than anywhere else in the world,"" he says. As the subject matter matures, many actors are taking Ramadan as an opportunity to prove themselves, and ultimately further their career. ""It's a lot of pressure, definitely,"" says Youssef. ""You are competing with superstars and with very professional people, and all this is happening in 30 days,"" he says.","Ramadan is the most lucrative TV season in Egypt.

"(CNN) -- Tests show products at a Peanut Corporation of America subsidiary in Texas may be tainted with salmonella, state health authorities said on Tuesday. The Texas Department of State Health Services said on Tuesday it requested that the plant be closed after the company reported the findings of a private lab. Doug McBride, a health services spokesman, said the positive samples were taken last week and the private company's lab results came back on Monday. State test results were expected to come back on Tuesday. The company voluntarily closed its Plainview, Texas, plant on Monday night ""after laboratory tests of sample products from the plant indicated the possible presence of salmonella in some products,"" state health officials said. A Blakely, Georgia, peanut processing plant is under investigation in connection with a salmonella outbreak that has been linked to eight deaths and has sickened about 600 people nationwide. That facility is not operating at this time, the FDA said on Tuesday. Operations of the Plainview Peanut Co. have been halted while state investigators and the FDA ""complete their investigation of the plant's procedures and records of food safety."" The state health agency said it is unaware of any illnesses linked to Plainview products and ""is developing specific criteria the company must meet before it can resume production."" ""The peanut meal and granulated peanuts had not been shipped out of the Plainview facility. The dry roasted peanuts had been shipped to a distributor but were detained and recalled before further distribution. It is not yet known if the salmonella possibly found in the product testing is the same strain of the bacterium implicated in a 43-state outbreak of salmonellosis,"" Texas authorities said. The Peanut Corporation of America, which runs the processing plant, said on its Web site on Tuesday that the Plainview plant is making the move voluntarily to cooperate with authorities. The original peanut butter recall launched weeks ago has expanded to include more than 1,000 products. The Peanut Corporation of America originally said tainted peanut butter and peanut paste were shipped by Peanut Corporation of America to institutions such as schools, nursing homes and prisons but not grocery stores. But on Sunday, the company revised its recall notice to say products were in fact sold to some retail outlets, dollar stores, such as 99 Cent Stuff, 99 Cents Only Stores, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree Stores. Products include Casey's, Parnell's Pride, Reggie, and Robinson Crusoe labels. Companies that make peanut butter are reporting a dip in sales despite the FDA's assurances that major-label peanut butter in grocery stores is safe. See FDA's list of recalled peanut products. Peanut butter makers not affected by the deadly salmonella outbreak are trying to get consumers to keep buying peanut butter. Companies such as ConAgra Foods Incorporated and J.M. Smucker Company have been running ads and offering coupons, trying to lure peanut butter customers as sales have plunged at least 20 percent since the salmonella outbreak. The Blakely plant was raided by the FBI Monday morning, a CNN affiliate reported.","NEW: Officials: Lab tests of sample products from the plant were taken .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- One of my first jobs in China was teaching English through songs on CCTV, China's national television station. That was in 1979, when the People's Republic was just coming out of the tumultuous Cultural Revolution. Ordinary Chinese still wore drab Mao tunics, and top officials debated whether the foreign cultural influences seeping into China were ""spiritual pollution."" Still, the CCTV station producers wanted to use national television to popularize English language, and they wanted a light program. I was recruited to join a group of amateur musicians to produce ""Let's Sing,"" a series of 30-minute specials to complement its weekly program, English on Sunday. Along with three Chinese performers, I would strum my guitar and sing English songs, including ""Clementine"", ""Puff, The Magic Dragon"" and ""El Condor Pasa."" Viewers learned new words, grammar and syntax as they learned the songs. Station producers closely vetted the lineup of songs and narration we prepared. They vetoed a few, including Bob Dylan's ""Blowin' in the Wind."" We produced 10 shows, which aired for weeks and replayed many times. We became local celebrities, occasionally recognized and stopped in Beijing's shops and alleys. Even today, the odd Beijing resident occasionally stops me and says he or she first learned English through my TV show. ""It opened a new world to me since you guys were always in costumes and staged the shows differently,"" recalled Karen Cai, who watched the show as a Beijing high school student. ""I remember you clearly because you usually played hero or prince-like role. Until the launch of 'English on Sunday,' I did not have the opportunity to watch people speaking English without any Chinese translation."" English -- and other foreign languages -- were virtually taboo when I first arrived in China in 1971. Years earlier, foreign-language books were burned or impounded as ""poisonous weeds."" Only authorized translators and academics dared to use English. President Richard Nixon's China visit in 1972 caused a brief ""English craze"". The late Premier Zhou Enlai, who had lived abroad in his youth and spoke a bit of English and French, encouraged this and even launched a program where young children of Chinese elite were sent to the U.S. to live with families and attend local schools to learn English. Some Chinese schools taught English, but students' vocabularies were limited to rudimentary greetings (""How do you do?"") and political slogans (""Long live Chairman Mao!""). When the Cultural Revolution reached another xenophobic height in the mid-1970s, English again became politically incorrect. English regained popularity after Chairman Mao died in 1976 and Deng Xiaoping launched his economic reforms and opened China to the outside world. In today's China, English is king. ""It's important to get a good job and even just get information from various sources,"" says Chen Lu, a 19-year-junior at Peking University. ""It gives me an advantage in a very competitive environment."" More than 400 million Chinese, about a third of the total population, are studying English, says China Education Daily. China's rapid economic growth and the boom in global trade and tourism have made fluency in English a much-valued commodity. Small wonder that pushy parents in Beijing are willing to fork out 300 RMB ($45) for a six-hour English course in schools who have hired native speakers from the U.S., U.K. and other Western countries. ""They want to learn another language to be more adaptable to an increasingly global world,"" says Mikala Reasback, an American college graduate who came to China to teach English. ""It's usually upper middle class and elite families sending their children to private lessons and taking adult lessons."" An English language teaching industry has flourished, involving universities, foreign-financed training institutes and countless private language schools. The market for China's English teaching business, experts estimate, has doubled in the last five years to over $3 billion. However, experts say, the quality of teaching varies widely, citing the need to set up a credit-rating system. The rush to learn English has also created a shortage of good English teachers, especially native speakers. Reasback, who taught in a private language school in Beijing for four years, says that compensations for teachers vary widely. Most legitimate companies offer from $1,200 to $1,800 per month (before taxes) for a 40-hour work week. They also cover visa fees, paid national holidays and an end of contract repatriation bonus. However, she tells CNN, the rates of pay vary from city to city -- English teachers in Chengdu or Qingdao are paid less than those in Beijing. In some cases, English teachers are given housing allowances and reimbursed for medical expenses but, Reasback says, these have to be negotiated in contracts. English-teaching has apparently become a popular if not lucrative profession in China. Who would have thought? When I was recruited to teach English songs on Chinese TV, we did not negotiate nor signed a contract. I was all too glad to be paid the equivalent of $10 per program and fed steamed pork buns during the taping.","In 1979, CCTV producers sought to use national television to popularize English .

"(CNN) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters over the weekend that ""deliberate"" action by somebody on board accounted for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 veering off course. Could the mystery of Malaysia Airlines 370 then be explained as an act of terrorism? To answer that you have to assess both the capabilities and the intentions of the known terrorist groups that might want to hijack such a plane. And you have to ask the question: Cui bono? For whose benefit? The al Qaeda-affiliated group, Jemaah Islamiyah, has a presence in Malaysia as well as in the Philippines and Indonesia. But the group has been under sustained law enforcement pressure for more than a decade after it bombed nightclubs on the Indonesian island of Bali in 2002, killing more than 200 people, mostly Western tourists. The group has also carried out bombings at the Australian Embassy in Indonesia and the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Hotels in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. However, the capabilities of the once-potent Jemaah Islamiyah have eroded over time. And would Jemaah Islamiyah, an Islamist militant group, target for attack the air carrier of a majority Muslim country on which quite a number of Muslims were likely traveling? It is more plausible that the group would select a Western airline because Western embassies and Western brand-name hotels have been the focus of their previous attacks and plots. A terrorist group that might have a motive is the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a separatist group in China founded by Uyghurs that has had some historical ties to al Qaeda and the Taliban. The Uyghurs are an ethnic group in western China who are Muslim. The group has conducted a number of terrorist attacks in China. Uyghur terrorists might have a motive to hijack the Malaysia Airlines flight as it was bound for Beijing and most of the passengers were Chinese. But Uyghur militants have operated almost exclusively inside China. And when they have tried to mount hijackings in the past they have been complete flops. On March 9, 2008, a 19-year old Uyghur woman attempted to set off some kind of explosive device on a flight from the Xinjiang Uyghur region en route to Beijing. The flight crew detained the woman before she could detonate the device. Four year later, on June 29, 2012, half a dozen Uyghur men attempted to take control of an aircraft flying in the Xinjiang Uyghur region using pieces of a metal crutch that had been sharpened to make crude weapons. This plot was also foiled. Bolstering the view that Uyghur terrorists did not hijack the Malaysia Airlines flight, on Tuesday a Chinese official said that background checks on the passengers on the plane produced no evidence that any of the Chinese citizens on board were involved in terrorism. Beyond Uyghur militants or operatives of Jemaah Islamiyah, might there be other terrorist groups with the motivation and capability of pulling off the hijacking of the Malaysia Airlines flight? It doesn't seem so. If this were a hijacking for political purposes, the hijacking would have been followed by an act designed to send a political message, such as the planes hijacked on 9/11 that were then flown into the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Or there would be set of demands, as was the case with the Indian Airlines flight that was hijacked to Kandahar, Afghanistan, by militant Kashmiri separatists in December 1999. They demanded the release of leading militants in Indian jails, a demand to which the Indian government acceded. Or there would be a credible claim of responsibility. The one claim of responsibility so far is from an outfit calling itself the Chinese Martyrs' Brigade. This claim is not deemed to be credible. Malaysian Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters last week: ""There is no sound or credible grounds to justify their claims.'"" If the diversion of Malaysia Airlines 370 was not an act of terrorism, the other likely scenarios are a pilot suicide attempt, the piracy of the plane for some kind of economic reason or the commandeering of the aircraft by someone with an idiosyncratic motive that will only become clear over time.","Officials say Flight 370 was diverted, but how likely is it that terrorists were responsible?

"(CNN) -- Turkey is no Egypt and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan no Hosni Mubarak. This is not a ""Turkish Spring,"" but a message to an elected leader to reign in his hubris and his divisive politics. These are some of the central messages, which both Turkish commentators (ourselves included), and the international media have brought across. Erdogan still has a choice, as the Financial Times reminds us, between rising to the highs of statesmanship of former French President Charles de Gaulle or spending his remaining political life as a Turkish likeness of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The question now being asked in Turkey's capital Ankara, on Istanbul's Taksim Square and in the occupied Gezi Park, where the initial protests started, is whether Erdogan has the political determination and the nerve to accept the demands of the initial protestors. WATCH MORE: 'Lady in red' does not want to be a symbol . That would mean giving up on his personal dream to build the Ottoman barracks on the park and turn it into a shopping mall. His track record would suggest otherwise. Probably the single most important trigger for the rapid spread of events was the prime minister's inability to listen to critique and disagreement, and the way in which this inability has manifested over the last few years. His rhetoric has been spiraling out of control and has ranged from lecturing women on how many children to bear to calling everyone who enjoys drinking a beer in a sidewalk cafe an alcoholic. READ MORE: Erdogan defends handling of protests . Further, the country has used an excessively violent policing strategy, with which the government has oppressed almost all legitimate protest by trade unions, political movements and student groups. All this extreme use of force looks awkward in a country where the government was re-elected with almost 50% of the vote only two years ago and where its macro-economic development indicators tell a story of unfettered progress. One might wonder why a government that still enjoys such popular support is unable to tolerate a few protests here and there and is incapable of giving into what are often very reasonable demands against the excesses of environmental degradation and rent-based urban renewal policies. Why would an elected prime minister, who has, until now, been respected abroad and at home, use the force of his security apparatus to crush so brutally any popular dissent, which is far from threatening his place at the top of Turkey's political system? WATCH MORE: The week that changed Turkey . Part of the answer lies in Turkey's recent record of undemocratic manipulations to bring the government down. Kemalist elites, the military, the judiciary and the so-called ""deep state"" rogue elements acting within the visible state structures, conspired to terminate the Justice and Development Party's (AKP) government from the very moment of its first election in 2002. Ever since, the party had to face several attempts at power grab, from an ultra-nationalist conspiracy in the mid-2000s based on unresolved assassinations of Christian missionaries and the murder of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink to the so-called Republican Marches against the election as President of Abdullah Gul to the Constitutional Court's only narrowly averted closure case against the ruling party in 2008. All of these experiences have led Erdogan and many members of the AKP government to look at Turkish politics through the prism of conspiracies, and the blame for this shift does not lie only with the AKP. More significantly though, the manipulations they faced from the judiciary and the military have led the AKP government to fill both institutions with sympathizers, thereby removing the already weak system of checks and balances in Turkey. READ MORE: Erdogan: Leader or 'dictator'? The confluence of both the conspiratorial mind-set and a lack of checks and balances has created the ground for Erdogan's unhealthy mix of extreme self-confidence on the one side and his insecurity vis-Ã -vis criticism on the other. The shopping mall in Gezi Park, the third bridge over the Bosporus, the new airport and a canal project that is supposed to connect the Marmara and the Black Sea have been devised without any consultation and public debate. That the prime minister sees any criticism of these projects as manipulations by domestic and external enemies is a sign of his insecurity. That he failed to grasp that the Taksim protests were not started by undercover military agents, die-hard Kemalists, Iranian agents or Syrian provocateurs may yet mark the beginning of his undoing. Will Erdogan be able to arrive at a sober consideration of the situation and give in to the demands of the protestors in Gezi Park, call an impartial review of police brutality and reconsider the heavy policing strategies, which have turned Turkey into a police state? WATCH MORE: Turkey as a 'pivotal' country . If he did, he would still have a chance to enter Turkish history as a statesman who carried his country into the 21st century, disassembled the military's tutelage, ended the Kurdish War and granted long-fought-for rights to the country's largest minority, the Kurds. If he fails, and drags the country towards polarization and political unrest, his government, the economy and hence the people of Turkey will lose. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kerem Oktem and Karabekir Akkoyunlu .","Turkey is no Egypt and Erdogan no Hosni Mubarak, Kerem Oktem and Karabekir Akkoyunlu write .

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- A deadly typhoon that slammed into China's coastal provinces and Taiwan over the weekend has displaced nearly one million people and left dozens missing, state-run media reported Monday. Residents gather to remove a fallen tree blocking a road in Changle, China, in Fujian province on Saturday. High winds and torrential rain of Typhoon Morakot hit coastal provinces Fujian and Zhejian hardest, and caused the worst flooding in decades in Taiwan -- where flood waters as high as 7 feet were reported, China Daily reported. The deadly typhoon swept across the Philippines and Taiwan's Hualien region before crashing into eastern China, claiming nearly two dozens lives along the way, the newspaper reported. The storm -- measuring about 1,600 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) across -- continued to pummel coastal China Monday, but forecasters said it is unlikely that Morakot would reach Shanghai, the country's largest city, which sits further north along the coast. Government officials expect the typhoon to cause more than 8.5 million yuan ($1.2 billion) in damages, the newspaper said. The storm made landfall in the coastal area of Beibi Town, Xiapu County in Fujian province at about 4:20 p.m. Sunday (0820 GMT), according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. Morakot's winds were clocked at 118 kilometers per hour (73 mph) in its eye, according to the province's meteorological bureau as cited by Xinhua. Video from Taiwan showed a six-story hotel crashing into the floodwaters coursing below. The well-known hot springs resort had evacuated before the collapse. At least seven people were killed, 32 wounded and 46 unaccounted for, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. In China, five houses were destroyed as the front of the typhoon brought flooding rains to Wenzhou City in neighboring Zhejiang province just after 8 a.m. Sunday, Xinhua said. Three adults and a 4-year-old boy were buried in debris about 8 a.m. Rescue workers were unable to save the child, and he died, the city's flood-control headquarters told the news agency. A ""red alert"" -- the highest degree in danger levels -- was issued in Zhejiang, where more than 35,000 vessels were called back from sea, China Daily reported, citing provincial flood control officials. More than 300 homes collapsed, and more than 16,000 hectares (39,500 acres) were flooded, Xinhua said. The city's airport was closed and 56 roads were rendered impassable. As the eye of the storm reached Beibi, the sky turned completely dark, and people caught in rainstorms staggered as they used flashlights to see, Xinhua reported. Trees were being uprooted and torn apart by damaging winds. Farmers were attempting to recapture large amounts of fish, flushed from mudflat fish farms by high winds, Xinhua said. Nearly a million people were evacuated from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces as Morakot approached. Late Friday, the storm lashed Taiwan, killing two people, wounding 15 and knocking off power to about 650,000 households, according to Hong Kong's Metro Radio. Meanwhile, another typhoon hit west Japan on Monday, with 12 people confirmed dead. Two others are missing, police said. Among the victims of Typhoon Etau was a 68-year-old woman who died when a landslide caused a hill to collapse on her home in Okayama prefecture, police said. In neighboring Hyogo prefecture, an 86-year-old woman was found dead in her flooded house and a 54-year-old man in his submerged car. Officials expect the number of victims to rise as torrential rains continue.

"(CNN) -- Some hobbies take talent, others don't, but the real skill is turning your weird past-time into an international event. Whether one's passion is to sculpt masterpieces out of sand or charge at Dapper Dans with an umbrella, somewhere, there's a festival dedicated to honing those skills. Few hobbies invite ridicule like air guitar. Yet the Air Guitar World Championships in Oulu, Finland, regularly attracts over 10,000 ""airheads"" (this year's event, which took place last week, was no exception). Though the judges seem to take the sport seriously, judging contestants on their technical skills, stage presence and ""airiness,"" the festival started as a bit of a lark. ""We started out in 1996 to promote the Music Video Festival. It was a half joke,"" says Hanna Jakku, the event's co-founder. Since those early days, however, the championship has matured. Contrary to popular opinion, says Jakku, air guitar takes talent. ""When it comes to competitive playing, the standard is quite high. It's a contest of showmanship. It's very well timed and choreographed and there's drama to each performance. Think of it as a combination of stand-up comedy and rock opera,"" she says. True aficionados can even earn a little extra cash. Last year's winner, Justin ""Nordic Thunder"" Howard, scored a contract with soft drink brand Dr. Pepper and, like many of his contemporaries, routinely works the festival circuit. The strange hobby capital of the world, however, is Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales. The tiny town hosts the Man versus Horse Challenge, the Welsh Open Stoneskimming Championships and the ever-popular World Bogsnorkelling Championships, the latter of which was held on August 25. Read more: World's weirdest food fests . ""It came about through drunken discussion in a local pub with a man who was trying to bring in more business to the village,"" explains Bernice Benton, from Llanwrtyd Tourism, of the bogsnorkelling contest, which last year attracted 177 entrants. The event requires snorkeled and finned-participants to swim two laps in a 180-foot peat bog. ""It's muddy, so it's dark and you can't see, and a lot of people aren't used to breathing through a snorkel. Generally, it's pretty cold, and you also have to deal with the leeches and water scorpions,"" says Benton. Contestants don't do it for the money (all proceeds go to charity), as much as the glory. According to Benton, some train quite hard for the event, and go as far as to snorkel blindfolded for practice. Even those competitions that are today taken in earnest have some pretty arbitrary origins. In 1933, Ohio-based photographer Myron Scott came across a group of boys racing in homemade vehicles, and decided to stage an impromptu race. The event has since morphed into one of most popular events on the DIY calendar, the All-American Soap Box Derby, in which kids and teenagers race homemade cars. Despite its name, the event attracts an international crowd, and many of the pre-adult contestants have grown up to become famous racers and engineers. ""Soap Box Derby racing teaches you not only the racing, but how to build a car, and what goes into making it fast,"" says Bobby Dinkins, the marketing director for the event. Contestants range in age from 7 to 17, and all have to qualify either by winning their local race, or racking up enough points in a rally race. As scholarships make up the winning booty, there's a lot at stake for potential winners. As a result, Dinkins notes, many practice pretty hard. Read more: Summer solstice: It's all about sex . ""These kids are racing all year long to qualify,"" he says. In Baltimore, Maryland, children and adults alike take part in a more whimsical dash: the Kinetic Sculpture Race. The race is composed of human-powered works of art designed to travel over land, mud and water (Fred Flintstone's car would qualify). Sculptures resemble anything and everything, from flying pigs to fluffy pink dogs. Prizes are awarded for conking out first, for maintaining middle ground, and for keeping all feet off the floor. ""We give out almost as many awards as there are vehicles,"" explains Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, founder of the American Visionary Art Museum, which hosts the event. The race incorporates 15 miles of downtown Baltimore and the harbor and, if not Baltimore's biggest sporting event, it is certainly its wackiest. Volunteers dressed as chickens help guide vehicles along the right path, while bearded doctors in nursing uniforms are on standby should any injuries occur. ""So much of art is self-involved,"" explains Hoffberger. ""This is a masterpiece of how to bring joy to an entire city.""","Good at air guitar?

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- As the Middle East erupts into turmoil, and protesters take to the streets, China's fear of ""luan"" (chaos) has resurfaced, analysts say. There have been whispers of a ""jasmine revolution"" on the internet and although calls for street protests have fallen flat so far, no matter: China appears jittery. The turmoil in the Middle East hasn't gotten much coverage in state-run media. There have been more police on the streets, dissidents reportedly under house arrest and social networking sites selectively blocked. Why? What does China fear? China has had a history of walling itself from the outside world, fearful of foreign invasion and domination, from the times of the Mongols to the Opium Wars against the British through the brutal Japanese imperialism of the 20th century. Despite the Chinese fascination with things foreign, historically there has been a fear among authorities of the influence of Western culture. Within its Great Wall, China has exerted strong control over its people. From the era of feudal warlords to modern China, rulers have been obsessed with avoiding bottom-up peasant revolts. ""The perpetual question in the minds of all Chinese was how chaos could best be avoided,"" writes Erik Ringmar in ""The Mechanics of Modernity in Europe and East Asia."" ""Political thought as it developed from the earliest times onward, including Daoism, Legalism and Confucianism, was more than anything attempts to answer this question."" These dual fears -- domination from without and revolution within -- have been inherited by successive national leaders, especially after Chairman Mao. For two decades until his death in 1997, Deng Xiaoping was driven to modernize China quickly while maintaining stability, ordering the brutal Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 while single-mindedly pushing the reforms that opened and transformed his country. President Hu Jintao, seeking to build a ""harmonious society,"" last month called on Chinese officials to learn ""social management"" to maintain stability. In his book ""The Beijing Consensus,"" Joshua Cooper Ramo wrote that ""the fear of chaos, of losing political and social control ... runs like an iron spine through the entire Chinese body politic."" China's economic transformation has been extraordinary. Market reforms have unleashed individual initiative and entrepreneurship. Hundreds of millions of farmers have been lifted out of poverty. Gleaming new cities have been built. China's economy is now the second biggest in the world after the United States. Yet despite these achievements, the Communist Party remains sensitive to criticism. Analysts say the lack of a popular mandate through direct elections makes the party unsure of its own legitimacy and fearful of overthrow and disintegration. ""They have no ideological justification for being in power,"" said David Zweig, social science professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""Their political institutions -- the parliaments, courts, police --are not independent ... They are often forced to rely on coercion to maintain power."" China's problem, Zweig said, is that the country is undergoing the most rapid social change in history but with a weak legal system. ""So problems like pollution, land transfers, urbanization all lead to grievances that have no medium through which people can have their grievances resolved, other than local protests and state repression,"" he explained. But the government is apparently trying to address those issues. To meet the challenge of governance, China has been advocating ""rule by law"" instead of ""rule by man."" To better manage rural affairs and address the farmers' day-to-day concerns, China has been experimenting with direct village elections. When successful, the system allows many grievances to get addressed on the grassroots level. Still, citizens complain about a slew of socio-economic concerns, among them inflation, jobs, housing, education and affordable health care. The gap between rich and poor remains the country's biggest fault line. Many have compared the protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square to those in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. China today shares many of Egypt's problems -- income inequality and corruption among them -- but analysts say the Chinese leadership is in little danger of becoming the next failed regime. The Chinese people themselves don't appear to have an appetite for revolution. ""I think most Chinese do feel that things are going pretty well in China, economically at least to date,"" said Orville Schell, director of Asia Society's Center on U.S.-China Relations. ""Obviously there are some dissatisfied elements, but I don't think that there's the same level of cause for a populist uprising."" The Chinese economic reform has trickled down to benefit the majority of the population, analysts said, while the Communist Party's grip on military, state media and the internet is a lot tighter and more sophisticated. In the Middle East, the poor and the disenfranchised have risen up in revolt. In China, many of those same people have risen from poverty. Analysts say continuing to spread the wealth remains one of China's biggest challenges.","Turmoil in the Middle East hasn't gotten much coverage in state-run media .

"(CNN) -- ""He who has not climbed the Great Wall is not a real man,"" the Chinese like to say. I've taken up that challenge many times over. I first climbed the Great Wall in August 1971, soon after I arrived in China as a tourist. I still remember my excitement and awe when I scaled its Badaling section, 85 km northwest of Beijing. It is, after all, the longest man-made structure in the world, stretching 8,851 km (5,500 miles) long. It is said to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World. I've lost count now but in the 40 years that I've lived in China, I must have climbed it about 80 times. That includes a trip onto the Shanhaiguan section, where the wall starts near the seaside resort of Beidaihe in the east and a trek to the Jiayuguan Pass in Gansu Province, where the wall ends in the west. In Beijing and its surroundings, the Great Wall is 629 km (391 miles) long with five sections, including the Badaling, the first one opened to tourists in 1957. I've climbed the major sections but one thing remained on my wish list: to sleep overnight on the Great Wall. It's one of those rites of passage, especially for adventure enthusiasts, history buffs and adrenaline seekers. One sultry summer day recently, I joined members of the Philippine Overseas Photographers (POP), a group of professional and amateur camera buffs, and embarked to realize my wish. We rented a mini-bus that took us at the foot of Jinshanling section, located in the mountainous areas in Luanping County, Hebei province, 125 kms (78 miles) northeast of Beijing. The Jinshanling section was first built in 1368 during the Ming dynasty and was rebuilt and restored over the centuries. Now it is 10.5 km (6.5 miles) long with five passes, 67 towers and two beacon towers. I traveled light, with one backpack (spare clothes, boiled eggs, fruit, chocolate bars, and bottled water) and a sling bag (cameras, a whistle, small flashlight, knife, wipes, pen and notebook, and a photocopy of my passport.) Of course, I lugged a sleeping bag. We were lucky to have several trained mountaineers among us who gently reminded us of their maxim, ""take nothing but picture, leave nothing but footprint, kill nothing but time."" It turned out to be a moderate trek, although some sections were steep and treacherous. Bricks and rubbles in some parts were loose due to wear and tear. Some 4,632 steps later (according to my mini-pedometer), we reached the Flowers Tower, a two-storey watch tower built in 1579. We chose as our camp site. On top of the tower, half as big as a tennis court, we staked our sleeping areas. We caught our breath and took pictures to catch the spectacular scenery as the light fades. Gazing at the panoramic view atop the rampart, I was reminded of an ancient phrase, ""land is under my feet; the world is mine."" I felt like a real man. Come nightfall, we looked up the sky dotted by stars and listened to the silence of the night. We took a lot of pictures. Combining long-exposure and light-painting techniques, our intrepid POP photographers took stunning souvenir photos, including a few frames featuring our favorite acronyms, CNN and POP, in the background. As we all tried to sleep, someone suggested that I recount to the group how I came to China 40 years ago and what I've been doing since then. It turned out to be a good way to put some members to sleep. We all woke up to an overcast day, but still one with unique hues. As we walked home, Jinshanling beckoned like a dragon snaking along the lush and rugged hills. All these years, the Chinese government has used the Great Wall as an iconic symbol of national pride and unity. Still, China struggles with how to manage and protect the Wall as it promotes mass-market tourism. During the climb, we encountered several workers who were repairing the steps of one steep section of Jinshanling. ""We are doing this to make it safe for hikers,"" one worker told me. I pointed at a half-collapsed rampart nearby and asked if they planned to restore it too. ""No,"" he said, ""we will keep its original state."" I felt relieved. What makes climbing the Great Wall, specially the unrestored sections, so special? ""Appreciating history and escaping the hustle and bustle of the city and the pollution,"" POP stalwart Owen Tiam tells me. A professional photographer, Tiam has climbed the wall more than a dozen times and has camped on it three times. What advice can we offer to people who wish to follow our steps? ""Three tips,"" says Tiam. ""Food and water (to share); a sleeping bag or a warm hug (to share) and friends and stories (to share).""","The Great Wall of China is symbol of national pride and unity .

"Washington (CNN) -- In 1994, on the eve of his trip to North Korea to persuade Kim Il Sung to negotiate with the Clinton administration over its nuclear program, Jimmy Carter had a series of briefings at the State Department. After several hours, Carter looked around the room at the group of diplomats assembled and said, ""None of you have told me what I need to know,"" according to a former State Department official involved in briefing the former president. ""You haven't told me what Kim Il Sung wants,"" Carter told his briefers. ""What he wants is my respect. And I am going to give it to him."" Sources knowledgeable about Carter's trip to Pyongyang this week to free American Aijalon Mahli Gomes expect the former president to take the same approach he used with Kim Il Sung in dealing with his son, current leader Kim Jong Il. Carter, they say, will give the North Korean leader the respect he craves, giving him a face-saving way to release Gomes. As with last year's mission by former President Bill Clinton to free journalists Laura Ling and Euna Less, the deal with North Korea was already done before Carter boarded the plane. In fact, the North Koreans have been looking for a visit from Carter for some time. University of Georgia professor Han Park, who helped arrange Carter's 1994 trip and played a role in this one, said he brought up the possibility of high-level talks with the former American president during Park's trip to Pyongyang in July. Park said the release of Gomes was actually a secondary reason for Carter's visit, the first being restarting talks with the United States. ""The release was not the North Korean purpose,"" said Park, who has visited the communist nation 52 times. ""They wanted to have a much more substantive discussion when the official line is seemingly blocked."" There was no shortage of envoys ready to travel to North Korea and negotiate Gomes release. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has gone on previous missions to North Korea, including the negotiated release of a detained American. He continues to hold occasional talks with North Korean diplomats. Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was also closely involved in coordinating efforts with the White House and State Department to free Gomes, who is one of his constituents, said his spokesman, Fredrick Jones. It was Kerry, Jones said, who informed the State Department about Gomes' arrest and has been urging the department to do ""whatever it takes"" to secure Gomes' humanitarian release, including sending an envoy if appropriate. Although he offered to go himself if that was the best option, aides say Kerry assisted with the search to find a suitable envoy. In the end, the North Koreans are exacting the highest possible price they thought they could get for the release, securing what they see as the credibility a former leader of the free world can provide. Last year, the North Koreans rejected several lower-level envoys before settling on Clinton, who returned with the two American women after three hours of dining and photo-ops with Kim Jong Il. Carter's 1994 trip to Pyongyang was successful in defusing the first North Korean nuclear crisis, paving the way for the 1994 Agreed Framework in which North Korea pledged to give up its nuclear weapons in return for aid. But it was also controversial because Carter reached a deal with Kim Il Sung and announced it without checking with the Clinton administration. Obama administration officials don't expect a repeat performance but have kept mum about Carter's trip, saying only if such a mission took place it would be purely a ""humanitarian effort."" The United States wants to ensure the likely success of any effort to secure Gomes' release and doesn't want to tie the mission to America's tensions with North Korea over its nuclear program. Those tensions have escalated in recent months with the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan, which the international community has blamed on Pyongyang. While the Obama administration recognizes the North Korean regime will likely use Carter's trip for propaganda purposes, officials say the most important thing is for Gomes, whose health is deteriorating, to be released. They caution against any expectation of a breakthrough between the two countries, insisting there is no change in U.S. policy toward North Korea. That policy has included tougher sanctions against Pyongyang and joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises off the Korean coast. But Han Park views Carter's trip as significant, as it comes at a time when negotiations between the United States and North Korea are at an impasse. Carter, he said, is not likely to succeed in obtaining North Korean concessions on defense issues, but nevertheless, his trip could help influence public perceptions of North Korea and eventually lead to direct dialog. ""I think President Carter has a keen interest in reducing tensions on the [Korean] peninsula,"" Park said. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report .","Carter likely to repeat his 1994 tactic: Give the North Korean leader respect .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Celebrating the traditional Lantern Festival this week, many Beijing residents spent a lot of money dining out and setting off fireworks to mark the end of the Chinese Lunar New Year. ""For the rich the money they spend is mere peanuts,"" says Mei Yana, a migrant from rural Henan province working as a restaurant waitress. Aren't Chinese getting battered with high inflation? ""That's the ordinary people's worry,"" she said. The annual ""Blue Book of China's Society"" compiled by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences noted that last year rising prices topped the list of the public's concerns. The consumer price index, a gauge of inflation, hit 5.1% last November, despite government pledges to rein it in at just 3 percent. Now hovering around 5%, CPI may seem manageable, but its food component is around 10%, with certain items soaring even faster. ""Prices of meat, fish and vegetables have gone way up,"" complained Wang Rongfang, a 68-year-old pensioner shopping at the Xinyuanli market in Beijing. Sometimes inflation pinches in disguised ways. In local retail stores visited by a Chongqing Evening News reporter, prices of some instant noodle brands were unchanged, while the weight of their packages fell from 95g to 85g. Some residents make ends meet by scrimping, others with black humor. Jokes circulating on Chinese-language websites offer suggestions on how to save money in inflationary times. ""Tell disgusting jokes to stop your wife from eating,"" says one. Another, in citing the soaring prices of meat, goes: ""My son has graduated with a PhD. He is considering whether to work for a software company or the pork business."" But inflation is no joking matter for China's Communist Party rulers, as soaring costs could trigger social instability. ""The Communist Party came into power in 1949 in part due to hyperinflation after World War II that broke the back of the Chinese economy and the Nationalist regime,"" says Patrick Chovanec, associate professor at Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management in Beijing. ""They know they nearly lost power in 1989 in part due to anger over rising inflation that fueled the Tiananmen protests."" The Chinese government has taken measures to curb inflation, from offering more subsidies for farmers to produce more essential goods to imposing price controls on scarce goods and government services. In recent months, China has tapped on the brakes to cool the overheated economy, albeit with limited success. Some analysts say prompt government measures are mitigating risks to avert a repeat of the Tiananmen Square unrest in 1989, when Beijing witnessed massive street protests that ended in a bloody crackdown on June 4. ""The current 5% inflation rate is far below the 20% in May 1989,"" said Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at the University of Iowa in the United States. ""Prices have been rising continuously in the past several years, so it is not a shock to most people in China."" Still, some economists say the CPI is only one measure of inflation and does not capture the full inflationary pressure in China's economy today. China's money supply, they say, has expanded by more than 50% over the past two years -- the stimulus fueling China's red-hot growth rates. With such monetary expansion, the question isn't why China is battered by inflation, but why China hasn't seen more inflation sooner. One explanation: All the new money printed went mainly into an investment boom, not a consumption boom. State banks lent out new money, which went to bid up the price of land, the price of commodities -- into so-called ""asset inflation."" Asset inflation, experts say, does not feel like inflation. ""When the price of bread doubles, it feels like it's getting harder to make ends meet,"" says Chovanec of Tsinghua. ""When the price of high-end condos doubles, it feels like smart investors are getting rich -- it feels like a boom."" Eventually, the asset inflation spills into the general price level. ""In my view, that's the real worry in China -- that what we're seeing in terms of CPI rates could just be the tip of the inflation iceberg,"" Chovanec added. By incrementally raising interest rates and reserve requirement ratio for banks, China has slowed down its inflation rate but only modestly. Ultimately, experts say, what China needs to do is tighten its money supply, which is still growing at nearly 20% yearly.","""Blue Book of China's China's Society"": Rising prices topped public's concerns last year .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- As the Communist Party of China (CPC) celebrates the 90th anniversary of its founding, party officials are pledging to continue the fight against corruption. ""Anyone who is corrupt, no matter who is involved, will be resolutely investigated to the very end,"" said Wu Yuliang, deputy secretary of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's anti-corruption body. As the CPC enters the 21st century, it will ""comprehensively tackle corruption from both its roots and symptoms, combining punishment with prevention,"" Wu added. It's a daunting task. Despite repeated campaigns to stamp out corruption, it remains rife and is one of the most incendiary sources of public anger. ""(Corruption) is so entrenched that honest officials are now part of a minority that risks being left behind,"" wrote the Economic Observer, a Chinese-language paper. ""It is a system where corruption is the rule rather than the exception."" Rampant corruption, officials say, is an unintended consequence of change. ""We're in the midst of major socioeconomic transformation,"" said Wu, the anti-corruption official. ""We are at a stage where corruption is frequent and prone to happen."" ""In the centrally planned economy,"" retired official Tang Wenjun said, ""there was no market and the government officials could not sell or buy much of anything."" Now, it's different. Corruption thrives, he says, in part because opportunities have expanded. China's GDP per capita, adjusted by purchasing power parity, reached $7,517 in 2010, according to the International Monetary Fund. That's up from $250 in 1980. The economic boom and the general rise in prosperity have made bureaucrats increasingly greedy. The result is corruption on a scale more pervasive than the founders of the Communist Party could ever have imagined. Graft and corruption includes nepotism, accepting bribes and kickbacks, lavish spending of public funds, and laundering of profits and public money overseas. Official abuse extends to all levels of officialdom, in and outside the party. A sampling of recent scandals: . • Liu Zhijun, sacked last February as China's railways minister, is now under investigation for corruption, according to Xinhua, the official news agency. • Huang Guangyu, the founder of home appliance retailer GOME, remains detained on charges of insider trading and stock manipulation. • Huang Songyou, former vice president of China's Supreme People's Court, was jailed for life, convicted of taking bribes totaling over $500,000. • Chen Tonghai, the former head of oil giant Sinopec, was given a death sentence, later converted to life in prison, in 2009 after being convicted of taking nearly 200 million yuan (nearly $30 million) in bribes. • Li Peiying, former president of the Capital Airports Holding Company, was executed in August 2009 after he was convicted of receiving 26.61 million yuan ($4.1 million) in bribes. • Kang Rixin, former head of the China National Nuclear Corporation, was sentenced to life last year for taking almost $1 million in bribes between 2004 and 2009 when he was general manager of the huge state-owned company. Kang, a former member of the policy-making CPC central committee, is thought to be the most senior CPC official to be investigated and punished since a former Shanghai mayor and party chief, Chen Liangyu, was sentenced to 18 years for bribery. With most of the populace suffering from rising inflation, complaining of the gap between the rich and the poor and worrying about their economic future, resentment of corruption is high. One popular saying in Beijing puts it bluntly: ""If the Party executes every official for corruption, it will overdo a little; but if the Party executes every other official for corruption, it cannot go wrong."" A public opinion survey conducted by Horizon Research Consultancy last year cites corruption as the worst problem tarnishing China's image. In response to the public outcry, the CPC is vowing to sniff out corrupt officials. Wu says his anti-graft group last year investigated 139,621 cases of malfeasance and punished 146,517 people. Of those cases, 5,373 have been referred to the courts for criminal persecution. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, speaking this week to a group of party members, pledged to give top priority to the anti-corruption drive. ""Each party member and cadre must abide by the law, be cautious and prudent and practice self-discipline."" The press, aided by netizens, has been working zealously to expose the corruption cases. Internet users have set up websites designed to help blow the whistle. Public relations consultant Chen Hong started a website -- www.ibribery.com -- allowing visitors to anonymously post their experiences of bribing officials. Some netizens exposed officials who demanded cars and villas, police officers who asked for cash incentives to not issue traffic tickets and doctors who wanted money to ensure safe surgical procedures. His site drew 200,000 unique visitors in two weeks, but censors have started to block access to his site. Worried that he was courting trouble, Chen closed it down last week, hoping to apply for a license and restart his site. Meantime, other netizens have set up copycat sites like www.522phone.com and www.wohuixingle.info vowing to out corrupt officials. Anti-corruption official Wu Yuliang acknowledges the role of the netizens and general public -- with a caveat. ""We hope the authorities will supervise the internet,"" he says. ""We hope they can guide the netizens, so they will air opinion through legal means, and the information they reveal are accurate and reliable.""","Corruption remains rife and is among one of most incendiary sources of public anger .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Misery hates company. Following the nuclear power plant crisis in Japan, China has ordered safety inspections of its existing nuclear plants and suspension of new plant approvals. The decision was made on March 16 during a meeting of Premier Wen Jiabao with the State Council, China's cabinet. ""Development of nuclear power must put safety the top priority,"" the government said on its website. Beijing's top nuclear power regulatory body quickly unveiled a series of guidelines advising nuclear power plants to take disaster stress tests on planned and existing projects. Changhua Wu, the Greater China director of The Climate Group, a non-profit group advocating environmental protection, applauded the decision. ""They are reviewing and reassessing nuclear power plants,"" she says. ""I believe they are going to find a lot of issues there."" Read whether the fear for nuclear disasters is realistic . China operates 13 nuclear reactors, a small number compared to the 104 in the United States, but China is poised to catch up. It's building more than two dozen others -- roughly 40 percent of all the reactors under construction worldwide -- and 50 more are being proposed. Read more special coverage on China . Such an aggressive nuclear power program is understandable. In the last two decades, China's energy needs have grown exponentially due to its rapid economic boom and urbanization. China last year overtook the United States as the world's largest consumer of energy. It depends on fossil fuel for 91% of its needs. China has turned to alternative sources of energy -- wind, solar and nuclear power -- to improve air quality and curb global warming. ""Nuclear power is seen as cost-effective, low carbon, and more reliable than renewable energy such as solar and wind power, which can only provide power some of the time,"" noted Century Weekly, a Chinese-language magazine popular among intellectuals. In light of the human and environmental disaster looming in Japan, however, many Chinese are asking: How safe are China's nuclear plants? Japan's nuclear crisis has served as a wake-up call, said Wu. ""As in Europe and other countries, people here are saying, 'Wait a second, let's really think about it,'"" she said. Experts say China is now reviewing the risks associated with earthquakes and tsunamis. It has had its share of major earthquakes, like the 7.9-magnitude quake in 2008, which killed over 80,000 in Wenzhou, Sichuan province. Its existing and planned nuclear plants are all located along its eastern and southern coastlines -- prompting questions of whether they are vulnerable to a tsunami. Another concern is lack of transparency. Although China has signed and ratified the International Atomic Energy Agency's Convention on Nuclear Safety, critics say China is slow in providing public information on safety and waste-management. Corruption is another worry. Kang Rixin, a senior Communist Party member and head of China's nuclear power program, was convicted last November in a $260 million corruption case in which he was accused of rigging bids connected to nuclear power plant construction. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but his case raised concerns about lack of supervision. ""Do we have enough manpower to manage and monitor so many nuclear plants?"" Wu of The Climate Group asked. ""If accidents happen, do we have emergency response in place? Are we ready? I am not so sure."" These questions are causing public concerns, Wu said. ""Already we have started to see the 'not in my backyard' mentality,"" she noted. ""Before the Japan disaster, most people do not necessarily understand the risks they are facing, but now people are actually more alert."" There is little public debate, except in cyberspace, where some netizens anonymously resort to sarcasm. Some expressed surprise to find themselves living in close proximity to nuclear plants. Other blogs listed locations of plants, with maps attached as well. One posting suggested that ""China should put all government officials' homes next to the plants."" Experts say there are robust debates among Chinese policy-makers, too. ""Some are quite convinced that the third generation technology in China's nuclear plants currently under construction is superior than Japan's,"" said Wenran Jiang, a political science professor at the University of Alberta. ""Others are more cautious, calling for more reviews and more safety measures."" Still, China is not about to abandon its nuclear power ambitions. ""The construction of nuclear plants will continue, but it will be a more cautious process,"" he said. ""Call it lessons learned from Japan."" Advocates of clean energy hope those lessons will inspire China to switch to renewable energy sources. ""Hopefully we need not panic and kill nuclear energy altogether,"" said Wu of The Climate Group. ""In the long run, we hope wind, solar and other safer renewable sources of energy will grow really fast to replace high-risk energy sources like nuclear and large-sized hydropower projects.""","Top nuclear power regulatory body unveils guidelines on nuclear power plant stress tests .

"(CNN) -- What do you remember about April 20, 1999? Families visit the graves of the Columbine shooting victims at Chapel Hill Memorial Gardens in 2007. If you recall that two unpopular teenage boys from the Trench Coat Mafia sought revenge against the jocks by shooting up Columbine High School, you're wrong. But you're not alone. Ten years after the massacre in Littleton, Colorado, there's still a collective memory of two Goth-obsessed loners, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who went on a shooting rampage and killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher, injured 23 others and then turned their guns on themselves. Journalist and author Dave Cullen was one of the first to take on what he calls the myths of Columbine. He kept at it for a decade, challenging what the media and law enforcement officials reported. ""Kids had never been attacked in this kind of way until Columbine,"" he recently told CNN. ""I just had to find out what happened to those kids.""  See if you know what really happened at Columbine » . Cullen's book,""Columbine,"" was released this month -- just in time for today's 10th anniversary of the shooting at the Colorado high school. While tackling popular misconceptions, Cullen also gives a riveting account of what happened that day and how the survivors view the event that marked their lives forever. Cullen concluded that the killers weren't part of the Trench Coat Mafia, that they weren't bullied by other students and that they didn't target popular jocks, African-Americans or any other group. A school shooting wasn't their initial intent, he said. They wanted to bomb their school in an attack they hoped would make them more infamous than Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. The Columbine tragedy left a lasting mark on many Americans, largely because of the media's around-the-clock coverage in the days and weeks following the shooting. Columbine was named the top news story of 1999 with nearly 70 percent of Americans saying they ""followed [Columbine] very closely,"" according to a Pew Research Center study.  Watch parents reflect on children lost at Columbine » . When media coverage faded, reporters and investigators soon learned that some of the initial reports were wrong. Cullen writes about the misperceptions: ""Facts rush in, the fog lifts, an accurate picture solidifies. The public accepts this, but the final portrait is the farthest from the truth."" Officials at the Jefferson County Sheriff's office agreed that the Trench Coat Mafia, among other myths, were false. Lead investigator Kate Battan said the 10-year anniversary offers a chance to clear up the misconceptions. ""It was the first big event where cell phones were around, and I had witnesses giving information to the media before I even got to it,"" she said. ""A lot of that information was wrong."" For example, many in the media initially reported that 17-year-old Cassie Bernall, a Christian, answered ""yes"" when asked if she believed in God before she was shot to death. She became a poster child for the Evangelical movement after her death. But investigators and student witnesses later told Cullen that it was another student, Valeen Schnurr, who avowed her belief in God as she was shot. Schnurr survived. Cullen's first book reading was in Denver, Colorado, a few weeks ago. He said most of the 150 guests, despite their close proximity to Littleton and the shootings, still believed that Harris and Klebold targeted certain classmates, among many other misperceptions. Today, after carefully combing through the boy's diaries, school assignments and police documents, journalists and investigators agree there is no evidence the killers singled out the jocks in a hit list. In fact, their victims varied in race, popularity, religion and age. Cullen said the myths were so widely reported that they were hard to take back later. ""You would have to go through a lot of corrections,"" Cullen said. ""You would need to have something blockbuster to shake them [the public] up and say 'Everything you know about Columbine, let it go.'"" Psychologists who study memory say people tend to remember first impressions. In the case of Columbine, what the public first saw and heard in the news tended to stick with them. Professor Elizabeth Loftus at the University of California-Irvine, who specializes in memory, said myths continue to be validated when people start talking with others about an event. Once memories are embedded, people resist changing their minds, experts say. ""Memories often fade and get more distorted as time passes,"" Loftus said . Five months after Columbine, Cullen wrote an article published on Salon.com revealing that most members of a group dubbed the Trench Coat Mafia had graduated years earlier. The Trench Coat Mafia was a nonviolent school group of computer gamers established a few years before the shooting, Cullen said. They feuded with the jocks and wore black trench coats. Harris and Klebold were not members, Cullen concluded after talking to students at the school and analyzing police documents. Neither boy appeared in the Trench Coat Mafia's yearbook group photo in 1998. iReport.com: How did Columbine affect you? The two killers were far from normal teens. Harris was a psychopath and Klebold battled depression, according to psychologists cited in the book. Even so, they also weren't the extreme social outcasts and loners depicted in the early days of media coverage. Records released later by the Jefferson County Sheriff's office showed that Harris and Klebold had their own circle of friends. Klebold took a date to the prom, riding with a dozen friends in a limo, just days before the shooting. ""I don't believe bullying caused Columbine,"" Jeff Kass, who covered the story for the Rocky Mountain News, told CNN. ""My key reason for that is they never mentioned it in their diaries."" After a decade of research, including hundreds of interviews and relentless requests for evidence and documents, Kass also released a book this month called ""Columbine: A True Crime Story."" It provides comprehensive profiles of the killers and their motives. Kass was able to get Klebold's college application essay through public records requests. The essay indicated he was a complex teen, who acknowledged hanging with the wrong crowd during his sophomore and junior years. Cullen, the original Columbine debunker, theorizes that the public was afraid to believe Harris and Klebold weren't total outcasts. By identifying them as goth loners who were ""weird"" or ""oddballs,"" it was easier to set them apart from other students and for schools to distinguish future potential shooters, he said. ""The bombs were inconsistent with what we remember,"" Cullen said. ""We dropped the one that was true and kept the myth."" Kirsten Kreiling, president of the Columbine Memorial Foundation, said she believed the initial reports that the killers were in the Trench Coat Mafia and targeted jocks. So did many other people in the community. Ten years later, Kreiling, who has diligently kept up with news reports on Columbine, knows those initial reports were false. She realizes many people still accept the myths and hopes the truth of what happened at Columbine will some day replace the popular misconceptions. ""Understanding what happened can help us try to prevent these things from happening again in the future,"" she said. ""If you don't understand history, you are doomed to repeat it.""","Columbine was named the top news story of 1999, according to the Pew Center .

"(CNN) -- Forget the English Premier League title -- Manuel Pellegrini wants to build a dynasty at Manchester City. The 60-year-old, fresh from leading City back to the top of English football at the first attempt, is already planning for next season -- and, by the sound of it, many years to come. Pellegrini, who signed a three-year deal last June after replacing Roberto Mancini, also won the League Cup and reached the last-16 of the European Champions League. And now, with his players enjoying an end-of-season break in Abu Dhabi, home of owner Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Pellegrini is plotting further success. It comes at a time when city rival Manchester United is in disarray, struggling to fill the vacuum left by Alex Ferguson, who led the Old Trafford club to unparalleled success over two decades. ""It depends on the owners of the club,"" Pellegrini told CNN when asked about his plans to take City forward. ""My way of thinking is that if you want to develop a club, the best way is to keep the manager for so many years if you can. ""Of course, at important clubs, the results are always very important, but with patience I think you can do better. ""A big club must always have ambition. We will start thinking about how we can improve, we will analyze a lot of things and will try and be a very competitive team next year in the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League."" Under Pellegrini, City has become a far more attractive side to watch and the team's goalscoring record has been remarkable. In the Premier League alone, City plundered 102 goals in 38 games, while also triumphing at Wembley by defeating Sunderland 3-1 in the League Cup final. Yaya Toure scored 20 league goals from midfield, while Sergio Aguero -- who missed a large part of the season through injury -- hit 17, and fellow striker Edin Dzeko came up trumps with 16. The shift in style from a more cautious approach adopted under Mancini has been well received by the City fans, and Pellegrini feels vindicated after the early doubts surrounding his appointment. ""It's a style of football that I've played wherever I've worked in South America and different countries such as Chile, Argentina and Ecuador,"" said Pellegrini, who then went on to manage Spanish clubs Villarreal, Real Madrid and Malaga. ""I also tried to play attractive football in Spain and be an offensive team. So doing it in a new league and the most difficult league in the world, it's not just about winning the title it's about winning with a style of football. ""I don't want to compare one with the other. Roberto won a title before me and had another idea of the best way to play. I think he was very important for the club also."" One area in which City is yet to taste success is the Champions League -- which its owners are desperate to win. In May 2013, chief executive Ferran Soriano stated that he wanted the club to win ""five trophies in the next five years."" ""I think we were very unlucky in the Champions League,"" added Pellegrini, whose team lost to Barcelona in the second round. ""But I'm sure that we've made a step forward this year and I hope next year will be better, including the Champions League."" In recent weeks City has reportedly been in discussions with UEFA as to the severity of sanction it will face under the European governing body's Financial Fair Play regulations. That wait appears to have been increased following Thursday's death of former Belgian Prime Minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene. The 73-year-old was presiding over the investigatory chamber of the Club Financial Control Body, and was expected to sign off any agreement with the Premier League club.","Manuel Pellegrini is preparing long-term vision for English champion .

"(CNN) -- Umma Azul, whose godmother is the county's President, on Saturday became the first child of a lesbian couple to be baptized by the Catholic Church in Argentina. Carina Villarroel and Soledad Ortiz asked Archbishop Carlos Jose Nanez for the blessing, according to national news agency Telam. The bishop reportedly said their marital status has no bearing on the child. A priest performed the baptism at the cathedral in Cordoba, Telam said. Same-sex marriage has been legal in Argentina since 2010, but is not sanctioned by the Catholic Church. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the baby girl's official godmother, could not attend but sent a representative, according to Telam. Ortiz had personally asked the President to be the godmother ""because it is a way to thank her and former President Nestor Kirchner for that law that gave us rights,"" she said. Ortiz told reporters that ""now we hope to get married by the church and we will fight for that."" Argentina is home to Pope Francis. Last summer, he told the media aboard a flight to Rome, ""Who am I to judge"" gay people? Two months later, in September 2013, Francis said the church has the right to express its opinions but not to ""interfere spiritually"" in the lives of gays and lesbians.

"(CNN) -- It was the most neck-breaking assignment I've ever covered. For 15 long minutes I strained my neck looking upwards as I interviewed the seven-foot-six Yao Ming just after he was drafted to the North American National Basketball Association's (NBA) No. 1 pick in 2003. Yao was the first ever NBA No. 1 pick from overseas. ""I'm happy to join the Houston rockets,"" he told me. ""Hi, Houston. I'm coming."" That was all he could say when I asked him to say something in English on camera. As an NBA rookie, he was then about to sign a four-year contract with the Rockets worth about $9 million, a mind-boggling bonanza considering the average yearly income per person in China then was less than $1,000. The Shanghai phenomenon confessed to feeling the pressure of representing one billion Chinese in the NBA. Yao Ming's lost legacy . But he had other pressing matters in mind. ""I have to learn to drive,"" he said. Not everyone believed Yao could make the grade in the NBA. Charles Barkley, a retired NBA star and a TV commentator, was so skeptical he promised to kiss a donkey's behind if Yao scored more than 19 points in a game in his debut season. Yao did and Barkley kissed a donkey's rear end. ""There are very few people that skilled at that size,"" basketball commentator P.J. Carlesimo, observed then. ""He has a lot of things you can't teach."" I quickly became a Yao fan. I watched every Yao game I could catch on TV. But I, too, wondered: Could Yao adapt to the rough-and-tumble world of the NBA? Is he tough enough to play against chest-thumping superstars like Shaquille O'Neal? And how long before he will be talking trash, shoving referees and snubbing fans? Yao turned out to be a real giant in every way. Yao was such a towering presence he could easily dunk the ball unless he is double or triple-teamed. You cannot teach height, as they say in basketball. But he was also equipped with a soft shooting touch that enabled him to score from the outside. ""For a big guy, Yao had excellent basketball IQ,"" says Ma Jian, 41, a retired national team player who played for Utah in the NCAA in the 1990s. ""He worked the hardest, too."" In the nine years he played in the NBA, Yao averaged 19 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks. His field-goal average: 52.4%. He was voted an All-Star player in the league eight times. I also admired Yao for his maturity and modesty. On court, Yao was pugnacious but never repugnant. Off court he was witty but never smart-alecky. When the Shanghai Sharks, his former basketball team in China, retired his number, Yao took out a full page thank you ad in Chinese newspapers that said: ""How does a single blade of grass thank the sun?"" Next to the giant panda perhaps, Yao is the most recognizable -- and likable -- Chinese face. ""He's just such an affable person with a great sense of humor,"" recalls Colin Pine, who served as Yao's personal translator during his first few years at Houston. Often described as the ""Smiling Giant,"" his wholesome image helped change some of the stereotypical images of China overseas. Admirers say Yao has done more for improving China's image overseas than any modern-day politician or diplomat. ""Yao has become a cultural ambassador who promotes Chinese culture to the world,"" writes the Chinese-language paper Basketball Pioneer. ""To quote Kobe Bryant, he has 'built a bridge between each of us.'"" Yao, 31, is scheduled to meet the press on July 20 to talk about his ""future personal development plans"". If he retires this summer, Yao would leave behind a giant void. ""He is the core of China's basketball,"" says Ma Jian, who often works as a sports commentator. ""He is the face of basketball and the NBA in China."" Will Yao Ming's departure endanger the NBA in China? He is also one of the richest men in China, having made millions of dollars in NBA salaries and commercial endorsements. He endorses Chinese brands like China Unicom and China Life Insurance, and global brands like Pepsi, Visa and McDonald's. He has even bought ownership of his old team, the Shanghai Sharks, a title-contender in China's local basketball league. What kind of legacy will Yao leave behind? ""Too soon to tell,"" says Jiang Yi, managing editor of Sports Illustrated China, a bimonthly Chinese-language magazine. ""He's just starting to make greater things happen."" Observers here say Yao can make a huge impact even in retirement. ""He can use his experience, resources and influence to do many things,"" says Ma Jian, who works as a sports newscaster and promotes a high school-level league. ""We need a lot of good coaches, teachers, grassroots programs -- just some of things he can support. We need a lot of Yao Mings who have the passion for basketball."" We in the media have dubbed the Yao years the ""Ming dynasty."" To the Chinese he has indeed been a regal presence. They just wish the dynasty wasn't ending so soon.","China's Yao Ming to announce on July 20 his ""future personal development plans""

"Beijing (CNN) -- Beijing and the Vatican are again shadow boxing over the ordination of a new Chinese bishop without the Pope's blessing. After years of quiet diplomacy and a tacit agreement to jointly appoint Chinese bishops, the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association -- which oversees the country's state-sanctioned church -- in recent days ordained one bishop over the Vatican's objections, while another was reportedly detained after resigning from the CPA. ""It's worrisome,"" said a Catholic priest in Beijing, who asked not to be identified. ""Are we going towards confrontation again?"" Bishop detained after shunning Party control . The two sides have been estranged since 1957, when China broke off relations with the Vatican. Beijing then accused Rome of engaging in anti-socialist activities. In recent years, they have been talking quietly about restoring official relations. One big stumbling bloc remains the Vatican's official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province. Analysts say the two sides are close to reaching a modus vivendi on the diplomatic issue, but remain far apart on the ordination of bishops. The CPA said last year that it would press ahead with plans to appoint 40 new bishops, a challenge to the Holy See's authority. ""It's a question of religious freedom and leadership of the Chinese church,"" explained the Catholic priest. China's 10 million or so Catholics remain divided between those who worship in illegal ""underground' churches""-- loyal to the Vatican, defiant of Communist Party control -- and those in a state-approved churches. Despite the division, and the festering spat between China and Rome, Chinese Catholics remain devoted to their faith. In recent years, Catholicism as other religions, are seeing a revival as more and more Chinese turn to faith. Congregations seem to be thriving, as I observed on a recent visit to the Yongning parish, about two hours drive north of Beijing. A choir sung the Chinese version of ""Morning Has Broken,"" as 200 churchgoers heard Father Francis Zhang Tianlu deliver a Sunday mass. Since he moved to Yongning last year, Zhang, 45, has turned a lethargic church into a vibrant congregation, as I discovered. ""When I moved here, this church building was so old, its roof was collapsing,"" Zhang told me during a tour of the area. The Yongning church was originally built in 1873 by the French religious order of Vincent Depaul, before it was destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 when members of an anti-foreign Yihetuan attacked foreign missionaries, diplomats and traders, as well as Chinese Christian converts. More than 600 Catholics were killed in Yongning and buried in the ground where the church now stands, Zhang said. Rebuilt in 1902, the church had been in disrepair until last year. ""We repaired it without government help,"" Zhang said proudly. ""Individuals and groups contributed, in cash and in kind and with volunteer work."" More are joining the church. ""When I just got here, there was only one 85-year old lady who attended the daily mass,"" he recalled. Last year, 268 older residents were baptized, and this year over 50 young city-dwellers converted, too. ""Finally I can see some faces of young people,"" he gushed. A Western Catholic priest, who asked to remain anonymous, credits the 45-year priest for adapting well to China's rapidly changing society. ""Father Francis is creating new urban congregations and that is exactly what the church in China should be doing -- continuing to minister in the old existing churches, or building new churches in old villages."" Zhang noted that his diocese used to be home to at least 2,000 Catholics. ""Many of them are still going to the underground churches,"" he said. ""Sometimes they invite me to their homes for a meal. They tell me they are eager to turn theirs into an open church, to worship God openly and devoutly."" His mission now, he said, is to encourage them to join the open churches. Zhang used to worship underground. ""For ten years, my family provided four houses for underground assembly,"" he recalled. ""In 1988, we decided to worship openly."" That means joining the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. A fourth-generation Catholic, Zhang attended a Beijing seminary for five and a half years. He later enrolled in British and Belgian universities, where he studied philosophy, psychology and church management. He also attended the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing to learn about diplomacy. ""Merely preaching is not enough,"" Zhang said. ""You have to learn some knowledge of international relations."" Zhang has also learned how to balance his faith with the authority of the state. Zhang disagrees, diplomatically, with Beijing's defiance of the Vatican in the ordination of bishops. ""I think it's not a good idea,"" he said. ""I do hope Chinese government will pay attention to the universal idea, the universal church law of the Holy See. ""At the same time I hope Holy See can really understand the church in China and find out what it really looks like. ""Of course we follow China and we also follow the Roman Catholic way,"" he added. ""Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. What belongs to God, return it to God. The state and church interaction is very dialectical."" For the foreseeable future, it seems, Chinese Catholics will just have to continue the balancing act between church and state.

"(CNN) -- Sarah Cymbaluk of Fosston, Minnesota, is a frustrated mom who took matters into her own hands. After claiming that her daughter was repeatedly bullied on the school bus and the school did nothing about it, she posted a video on Facebook. In the video, Cymbaluk asked her crying daughter, ""Tell me how it makes you feel."" Her daughter, who turned 9 on Tuesday, responded, ""It makes me feel sad and scared, and I don't like it."" ""She's been called into the principal's (office) and made to feel like it's her fault,"" Cymbaluk told CNN affiliate KXJB, claiming the bullying has gone on since December. ""She's been told to ignore it. She's been told to disregard it. Basically she's been told to stuff her emotions and get on with life."" Fosston Schools Superintendent Mark Nohner, who said he thinks the situation could have been resolved without going to Facebook, said he learned about this issue only recently but conceded ""somewhere along the line"" the case ""fell through the cracks."" Are we too quick to cry 'bully' these days? ""And so we need to review our procedures and policies and maybe do a better job of articulating to the parents what we're doing,"" said Nohner. While Cymbaluk has come under some fire for posting the video of her tearful daughter, this case demonstrates how angry and helpless parents can feel when they believe their child is being bullied and that nothing is being done to stop it. 'You want to do something to help your child' Becki Cohn-Vargas, a parent of three grown children, is a former principal, superintendent and teacher with more than two decades of experience in education. She is now director of Not in Our School, a program that works to create networks of schools that are free of bullying and offers a guide to parents on how to deal with bullying behavior. ""Without knowing all the details of the case, what I can say is that I can understand a parent's frustration because I, as a parent, have moved my child from a school ... so I know that you feel desperate,"" said Cohn-Vargas, who transferred her own daughter to another high school years ago because of a bullying incident. ""You want to do something to help your child."" Police file raises questions about Rebecca Sedwick's suicide . The key is focusing on the most effective methods to make sure your child feels safe. That begins with talking with your child and determining whether they have, in fact, been bullied, she says. ""It isn't supportive to your child to just jump in and defend when you don't know exactly what happened,"" said Cohn-Vargas, co-author of the book ""Identity Safe Classrooms: Places to Belong and Learn,"" who says she's had her share of experiences as a principal with parents coming in with ""guns blazing."" ""I had so many cases where parents ... felt like they had to defend their child because they thought that was support."" Parents might first encourage children to try and handle the situation by standing up for themselves and telling the bully to stop. If that doesn't work, the next stage would be working up through the chain of command, said Cohn-Vargas, beginning with the person closest to where the alleged bullying took place, such as a teacher if it took place in the classroom or a bus driver if the incident happened on a bus and then moving on to the principal and the school district. ""I am not trying to underestimate that it's hard because school districts sometimes put their head in the sand, they don't want to see what's happening, but I think more and more school districts are very pro-active,"" said Cohn-Vargas. When friends become bullies . 'Document, document, document' Nancy Willard, director of the group Embrace Civility in the Digital Age, which works on combating cyberbullying and author of ""Positive Relations @ School (& Elsewhere),"" doesn't totally agree. She says she hears from far too many parents who say schools are rationalizing bullying behavior, saying things like ""It wasn't that big of a deal"" or ""You're overreacting"" or ""Your kid needs to learn how to deal with it."" Willard, who has created her own empowerment guide for parents, says her first advice is to ""document, document, document."" Parents should chronicle what happens, what staff were around and what they did, what the impact has been in terms of emotional distress, how the alleged bullying behavior may be interfering with the child's education and after-school activities and what the school response has been, said Willard. If the school is not responding, a parent can go the person charged with responsibility for ensuring safe schools at the district level, she said. ""If you don't get help at the district level, then you go to the State Department of Education."" Parents, beware of bullying on sites you've never seen . If a child is being bullied and there is a civil rights violation, a parent can file a civil rights complaint either at the state or federal level, she added. ""Parents need to know that they have more power,"" said Willard. A focus on reconciliation, not punishment . She said parents should not be focused on punishment, which could lead to retaliation and more pain for the bullied child. Instead, they should ask the school to see that the person responsible for the hurtful behavior gets help since other problems may be pushing them to bully and work with the school to create an opportunity, at some point, for the child who caused the pain to make amends. Cohn-Vargas adds that parents should refrain from immediately trying to schedule a meeting with the parents of the child doing the bullying. ""It's because it can turn into conflict between adults,"" she said. ""It just can get ugly really fast."" Willard said part of the reason why she created her parent guide in the first place is because she believes parents can help schools make positive change. ""If we've got 1.2 million kids who are experiencing hurtful acts at school each week, that's a fair number of parents who if they got motivated could encourage and empower change,"" she said, citing numbers from a 2011 Department of Justice report. Cohn-Vargas believes schools and school districts are ""in the beginning stages of addressing bullying effectively."" She believes only a multifaceted approach will succeed -- one that includes empowering students to identify issues and solutions, teaching bystanders to stand up against bullying and looking at bullying as a learning experience where kids can move on and change. She cited a recent case involving a middle school, which worked with her program, Not in Our School. Three boys photoshopped a picture of an eighth- grade girl, adding a swastika, a naked image and an anti-gay slur, and circulated the photo. When telling bullying victims to 'just fight back' doesn't work . School officials identified three students were responsible, including one Jewish student, and wanted the children to really learn from the incident. They came up with the idea of having the students do research on the topics involved including the history of the swastika, said Cohn-Vargas. ""So what does the school do to handle it right? They take it seriously, they investigate. They look at it as a learning experience,"" she said. ""All children at some point end up being either a victim, a bystander or someone who does the bullying and so it's a matter of creating a learning opportunity for the kids.""

"(CNN) -- Once the ultimate power couple in China, Bo Xilai and his wife Gu Kailai have now vanished. Bo has been stripped of his top Communist Party posts for unspecified ""serious violations of discipline,"" while Gu has been detained in connection with the death of Neil Heywood, a British businessman. The scandal has rocked the Chinese leadership to the core. But weeks after the shocking news of the couple's fall from grace broke, little substantiated information has come out. It has mostly been rumor and speculation. Some people at the center of the story have been silenced. Others have been locked up. Inside murder mystery hotel . But one insider who has dared to speak is Wang Kang, a self-described ""independent thinker,"" who seems to move in and outside Communist Party circles. Born and bred in Chongqing, a sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million where Bo served as party chief for four years, Wang, 64, knows what makes the city tick. In recent weeks, while China's official media have remained tight-lipped on the Bo scandal, Wang has talked with numerous overseas media, revealing tales of scandal, blackmail, murder and arrests. 'Party boy' son hits back at allegations . ""I know I'm taking a little risk by agreeing to take your interview,"" Wang told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""But what I'm saying is basically in line with the central government. Several foreign media told me they couldn't find one single interviewee in the vast city of Chongqing. They dare not sound off their opinion. This is sad."" Wang acknowledged he is not personally familiar with Bo. He met him only once many years ago, before Bo moved to Chongqing. But he boasts a network of ""guanxi"" (connections) -- academics, writers, journalists, businessmen and officials -- some of whom claim to have knowledge of the Bo scandal. China enters internet 'battlefield' over Bo . ""I'm stronger at analyzing,"" he said. ""As for the truth, many other people know much more about it than I do."" Still, Wang talked expansively about the unfolding political scandal. He said Bo portrayed himself as a modern-day Mao Zedong. ""Bo borrowed Mao's ideology as the core of his own governing,"" he said. ""But going back to Mao's path was definitely not an option. It was a dead-end."" Bo's campaign of smashing gangs and reviving Communist, Mao-era songs -- ""smash black, sing red,"" as he called it -- caused a lot of damage in Chongqing, according to Wang. ""Extortion of confessions through torture was commonplace,"" he added. ""Too many unjust and mistaken cases were made in the process."" Why did Bo seem to enjoy public support? ""He gained some support from a certain crowd, which is pathetic,"" Wang opined. ""Deng Xiaoping didn't conduct a thorough reform to erase Mao's impact, and the opening up [of China's economy] has led to a huge rich-poor gap and enormous corruption in the Communist Party. ""It's natural that some people would want to go back to the egalitarian Mao era because Deng brought back capitalism which some people didn't welcome. ""Bo gained support in Chongqing in part because Beijing never effectively reformed its political system,"" he claimed. What about Bo's ties to Neil Heywood? Was he a British spy? ""Personally I don't think Heywood was a spy,"" he said without elaborating. The China-based businessman reportedly moved in the orbit of a company known as Hakluyt and Co., a British strategic information consultancy formed by former officers of the UK's spy agency MI6. Hakluyt recently released a statement saying: ""Neil had a long history of advising western companies on China and we were among those who sought his advice. We are greatly saddened by his death."" Meanwhile, Wang expressed doubts Bo was involved in Heywood's murder. ""If it's like what was reported, that Bo was shocked on learning of Heywood's murder, he may not have been involved previously but may have tried to hide or minimize its impact,"" Wang said. As for Bo's wife, Wang noted official Chinese reports allege Gu may have been complicit in Heywood's death. ""As for her motive, I think it's either struggling over financial interests or disagreements related to their personal affair,"" he said. ""It somehow became impossible for Gu to end this relationship with Heywood. My guess is both factors exist. They were involved both financially and romantically."" Was Bo involved in corruption and bribery? Wang could not say for sure. ""I don't know whether he's interested in money, but my understanding of politicians of his kind is they are not impressed much by money, maybe by women -- think about Hitler or Mao -- but by power,"" he said. ""Money is a significant factor nowadays, for sure, but I don't know about Bo's attitude on this."" Wang then proffered lessons that could be learned from the Bo saga. China, he said, needs political reform. ""Bo is not so extreme, he is still reasonable,"" he said. ""If some Maoists like those online bloggers of 'Utopia' came to power, it'll be a disaster. This is what we can learn from the Bo Xilai case: start political reform immediately and return power to people."" Another lesson, he said, comes from censorship. ""The lack of free flow of information and expression channels are blinding people,"" he explained. ""'Rumors stop at the wise mind', an old Chinese saying says. In modern days they stop when there are open channels, media freedom and transparency."" As the hour-long interview came to a conclusion, Wang declined to speculate on the outcome of the Bo scandal. He said only the main characters in this saga can possibly know more -- the deceased Heywood, Gu and Bo himself.","Bo Xilai stripped of his top Communist Party posts for unspecified ""serious violations of discipline""

"(CNN) -- The United Kingdom won't compromise over the sovereignty of Gibraltar in the latest row with Spain over the rocky outcropping on its southern tip. ""Our differences with Spain on Gibraltar will be resolved by political means through our relationship as EU partners, not through disproportionate measures such as the border delays we have seen over the past week,"" the UK Foreign Office said in a statement. Spain recently ramped up border checks, leaving drivers languishing in line for hours on end. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Garcia-Margallo also has suggested imposing a 50-euro fee on every vehicle entering and leaving Gibraltar. A spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron called the prospect of fees worrisome. ""Clearly, we remain seriously concerned by the events at the Spain/Gibraltar border on this issue of border fees. The Spanish have not raised the prospect of introducing border fees with us. We are seeking an explanation from them regarding reports that they might target Gibraltar with further measures."" Garcia-Margallo said the money would go to help fishermen whose fishing grounds have allegedly been damaged by authorities in Gibraltar. The British territory has been working on an artificial reef. ""We will be seeking an explanation from Spain following reports that the Spanish government might target Gibraltar with further measures,"" the Foreign Office said. The history . Britain's 300-year-long control of the Mediterranean colony has been a persistent irritant in its relations with Spain. Talks on its fate re-started in July 2001 after breaking off in 1987. London and Madrid came close to a deal on joint sovereignty in 2002, but it collapsed after an unofficial referendum showing that 99% of Gibraltar's 30,000 residents opposed the change and feared they would be abandoned by Britain. Britain gained possession of Gibraltar in 1704 and legal control of the strategic port with the Treaty of Utrecht nine years later. The treaty granted Spain the first right to reclaim Gibraltar if its status changed.","NEW: British PM wants to hear what Spain has to say about Gibraltar border fees .

"(CNN) -- The decision on whether Medicare pays for sex-change operations is now in the hands of regional administrators, thanks to a decision Friday by a federal board that overturned a national policy of not covering such surgeries. The ruling by the Departmental Appeals Board of the Department of Health and Human Services gives authority to 15 regional contractors who administer the Medicare program to decide whether sex-change surgeries will be covered in their territories. ""The national policy barring Medicare from covering gender transition surgery has been invalidated,"" said Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesman Aaron Albright in an e-mail to CNN. ""As with all such determinations, CMS will carry out this independent board's ruling through Medicare Administrative Contractors, who manage Medicare claims payment systems. These contractors may cover this care case-by-case or under a local coverage determination based on clinical evidence to determine medical appropriateness,"" added Albright, whose agency administers Medicare and Medicaid. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), and the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) responded with a joint statement praising the move: . ""This decision removes a threshold barrier to coverage for medical care for transgender people under Medicare. It is consistent with the consensus of the medical and scientific community that access to gender transition-related care is medically necessary for many people with gender dysphoria,"" the statement said. ""The removal of the exclusion of coverage for surgical care for Medicare recipients means that individuals will not automatically have claims of coverage for gender transition-related surgeries denied. They should either get coverage or, at a minimum, receive an individualized review of the medical need for the specific procedure they seek, just like anyone seeking coverage for any other medical treatment."" The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force issued a statement that concluded, ""The dominoes are falling rapidly.""","Until Friday, a national policy barred Medicare from covering sex-change surgery .

"(CNN) -- Ever since the early 1960s when we were glued to the animated sitcom ""The Jetsons"", whimsical visions of a futuristic space utopia filled our imaginations leaving people asking themselves: ""Where's my flying car?"" Point taken, but perhaps now, as our childhood dreams move slowly closer to reality, we should also start pondering this: if a flying car was here today, in the real world and not in the realm of science fiction, would we feel comfortable controlling it safely while cruising thousands of feet up in the air? Would we possess the technical skills required to even get it off the ground, let alone land it without a scratch? Before you dash to the door and sprint to your nearest pilot school to sign up for flight lessons, take a moment to meet Carl Dietrich, the chief executive and co-founder of aerospace company Terrafugia. Dietrich and his team are working to bring consumers closer to the prospect of a practical flying car, envisioning a vehicle that does not require its operator to be a trained pilot. Thus, Boston -based Terrafugia announced last May it had started working on the concept of TF-X, a four-seat, plug-in hybrid electric car that can do vertical take-offs and landings. Who makes the calls? Although not driverless, Dietrich says the TF-X could increase the level of so-called ""human directed local autonomy,"" a term he describes as a ""big fancy phrase"" that essentially means that the vehicle's operator won't need to have the knowledge or skills of a pilot. ""They don't need to know those things because the computer is plugged in to a data network that automatically helps them plan the flight path, avoid other air traffic and air space restrictions, things of that nature,"" says Dietrich. He explains that operators would still have to make high-level, critical decisions, like determining whether it's safe to take off and land or approve the landing zone in advance. ""Anything that happens on the ground, the person is going to make a call,"" says Dietrich. ""Once you're flying, the actual operation of all the flight control surfaces is going to be computer controlled because, frankly, the computer can do it better than a pilot."" Yet, if you have the vision that the semi-autonomous vehicle would help you escape annoying traffic jams by simply taking off the ground, you'd better think again. ""That's science fiction and that will always be science fiction,"" says Dietrich, explaining that vertical liftoffs require a lot of air to be blown down which is not practical and can cause damages to neighboring vehicles. Instead, TF-X would be able to take off in airports and helipads, as well as specially designed spaces -- the size of a tennis court -- that would be devoid of street lights, road signs and power lines. From dreams to reality . Yet, the TF-X concept is not Terrafugia's first attempt to take to the skies. Founded in 2006, the company made headlines in recent years with Transition, a street legal airplane that can be flown in and out of general aviation airports. More like a driveable plane than a flying car, the two-seat vehicle can fold up its wings -- just like putting the top down into a convertible car -- and fly with a cruise speed of 100 miles per hour; it can also be parked inside a single car garage, driven on the road on a highway speed and run on automotive gasoline. Terrafugia has been flying prototypes of Transition since 2009 and is now very close to getting it to the market. ""We have over 100 orders for Transition,"" says Dietrich, adding that Transition costs $279,000. ""We are expecting to ship the first products to customers in the second quarter of 2016."" But in order for users to be able to fly the Transition, they would need to have at least a sport pilot's license, which requires 20 hours of flight time -- most sport pilots take 30-35 hours to get their sport pilot certificates. With its new prototype, however, Terrafugia believes that just five hours would be enough for users to learn how to operate the TF-X vehicle, appealing to a broader segment of the population. Dietrich says all operators will need to know is how to interface with the vehicle, how to determine if it's to safe to take off and land and what to do on the event of an emergency -- in those cases, operators would be able to pull a handle which would be able to activate a parachute system for the entire vehicle by pulling a handle. Future is now? So, how far away are we from our first ever TF-X air cruise? ""It's hard to say exactly, but we estimate eight to12 years,"" says Dietrich, who admits that even if Terrafugia had all the capital required to develop TF-X -- which it doesn't -- the realization of the project depends on technological developments as well as regulators changing the way aircraft are currently certified. Dietrich says Terrafugia is ""heavily involved"" with international committees to write new certification standards that account for some of the new technologies that are increasingly coming to the market for manned and unmanned aircraft, and which also apply to TF-X --- things like electric motors and batteries for general aviation aircraft. ""Those sort of things have never been certified before so we don't know how long it will take for regulatory bodies to adapt to the new technology,"" he says. ""The rules are all very old, the rules need to be updated,"" adds Dietrich. ""If the rules are successfully updated then we see the possibility for somebody to get what we call a TF-X operator's permit in as little as five hours."" Ultimately, Dietrich says, the goal of the whole TF-X program ""is to make the idea of the flying car a reality."" ""In order to do that, we have to lower the barrier entry to aviation,"" he adds. ""We have to make it easier, we have to make it safer, we have to make it faster than driving your car, and we have to make it significantly more convenient than operating an airplane today,"" continues Dietrich. ""It's going to take a while to get there, but that's the goal.""","Aerospace company Terrafugia is working on the concept of a flying electric car .

"(CNN) -- It used to be a writer wrote something, the program aired, and that was pretty much it. ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" airs frequently on cable as well as on NBC. Sure, there was the possibility of syndication, but there weren't cable channels that ran ""Law & Order"" marathons. There weren't DVD box sets of a program's season-by-season run -- a huge source of revenue. There weren't video games that began where a TV series left off, or on-demand TiVo subscriptions that allowed viewers to catch up with that episode they missed, or Internet sites that downloaded, highlighted and offered behind-the-scenes glimpses of a 38-second guest-star appearance. There wasn't all this ... technology. And, by the same token, all that technology wasn't splitting the audience for TV and movies into smaller and smaller pieces. Consider how the world has changed since 1988, the last time the Writers Guild went on strike. ""The Cosby Show"" was America's No. 1 TV program. Fox, just ending its first season with a weekend-only lineup that included ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The New Adventures of Beans Baxter,"" was barely a blip on a TV screen dominated by ABC, NBC and CBS.  Watch the writers strike in 1988 » . And if a household had cable -- and just a bare majority did -- channel selections didn't include much beyond CNN, HBO, ESPN, MTV and the Weather Channel. Bruce Springsteen's song ""57 Channels [and Nothin' On]"" didn't come out until 1992. Now Bruce, and the rest of us, are staring at 500 channels and countless media permutations. About the only thing that's remained consistent are fickle viewers, who now have more means to channel-surf -- indeed, media-surf -- than ever before. And if they leave their TV shows behind, they might be hard to get back. ""Once another medium, particularly cable, gets a chance to draw viewers away, they don't come back, and that wasn't the case in 1988,"" TV historian Tim Brooks told the trade publication Multichannel News. (Actually, Brooks is a little off: Broadcast viewership did decline slightly after the 1988 strike, according to Multichannel News, and has been trending downward since the early '90s.) The catch today is that there are far more media than just cable. Indeed, the media conglomerates have caught on to this fact, allowing viewers to watch programs over the Internet and through podcasts. (Indeed, with the strike affecting late-night talk shows, movie and music promotion has gravitated to the Web. ""Traditional media needs the exposure on the talk shows, but what they really need is to go where the audience is migrating to, and that is the Internet,"" Jerry Del Colliano, a University of Southern California music-industry professor, told The Associated Press.) The residuals due for airing over the Internet is a key issue the writers want tackled. In a pre-strike post on his New York Times blog, Times technology writer Saul Hansell observed that the Web is a knife that cuts both ways. If the writers get a cut of Web revenues -- an unknown value since nobody knows what Web syndication is worth -- the value of broadcast and cable syndication could decline. Or if the price the writers receive is perceived to be too high, new, nonunion talent could establish a beachhead. Or, he adds, ""bored viewers may suddenly start deep explorations of puppy punting and other specialties of YouTube.""  Watch a writer talk about how ""nobody wins"" » . Robert Thompson, the Syracuse University pop culture expert, doubts things will come to that: ""When you think about the shows we loved best ... they were told by brilliant writers,"" he told Multichannel News. ""I think the industry is going to have to cede that fundamental basic value, and in doing so cede some of the real estate of these new technologies."" Certainly, there's always going to be a market for well-told stories. ""There is no dream until we dream it. There is no word written until we write it,"" the commentator and science fiction writer Harlan Ellison (""Babylon 5,"" the story ""A Boy and His Dog,"" the TV column collection ""The Glass Teat"") told CNN during the 1988 strike. But the earlier strike -- which began March 7 of that year, lasted 22 weeks, postponed the beginning of the 1988-89 TV season and cost an estimated $500 million -- gave rise to a group of low-budgeted shows, including ""America's Most Wanted,"" ""Cops"" and ""America's Favorite Home Videos,"" which became the forerunners of the reality show trend. Reality shows, of course, are now one of TV's most prominent genres. They're generally inexpensive to produce -- and, as many writers noticed during the reality craze earlier this decade, they don't need writers. So there's a lot at stake. And watch out: On June 30, 2008, the contract for TV and film actors comes up for renewal. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

""Can't you stop staying fudge all the time, Tony?"" a tiny and angry Elvira Hancock says to pint-sized Cuban druglord Tony Montana. ""You do coke and you kill people. That's wonderful, Tony ... I'm leaving you, mother-fudger!"" Yes, it's ""Scarface,"" but not director Brian DePalma's remake of the 1932 gangster film. And the diminutive actors are children -- elementary-age children. They're appearing in one of the hottest current viral videos, ""Scarface: The School Play."" Watch the video . But it's not really a school play, says producer Marc Klasfeld of Rockhard Films. It's just a video aimed at illustrating the pervasiveness of sex and violence in our media culture -- and how it blankets children on a daily basis. Klasfeld, a commercial and music video director, says his first love is viral videos. ""I love the aesthetics, and it's a brand new avenue of expression for filmmakers to express themselves freely,"" says Klasfeld, whose previous video statements include ""Hammer Pants Dance"" for A&E, featuring a group of people invading a clothing store in gold lame ""Hammer pants"" -- a la M.C. Hammer, circa 1989 -- and dancing, much to the surprise of shoppers. OK, but Scarface? With children? ""It's the most in comedy and satire and opposite attracts,"" he said. ""What is the most opposite film there is to children? It's Scarface."" With two young children, Klasfeld said the issue of what is and isn't permissible in media content is a key issue. The Scarface video, he said, might launch a dialog. ""What's interesting to me and my wife is that the video is shocking, yet everyday, we have to guard what our children view from television commercials or video game violence,"" he said. ""So, it's interesting to me on a lot of levels and it's creating that debate."" The children in the video are between the ages of 7 and 10, Klasfeld said. He collaborated with a Los Angeles, California, casting director, with whom he's worked on several projects, to find talented children for the video. The children's parents, he said, have not complained about the content, but then again, the casting was in Hollywood, where ""we're asked to do all sorts of things."" ""Obviously there are people who find it outrageous and provocative, but there are a lot of parents, who are like me and my wife, who see all the violence on television and all the different things that are sold to children and that's a thousand times worse than this video.""","Video is brainchild of producer Marc Klasfeld of Rockhard Films .

"Editor's note: Mark Sanford, a Republican, is governor of South Carolina. Gov. Mark Sanford says opposition to the stimulus bill doesn't mean doing nothing to fix the economy. COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- When a debate as important -- both in terms of policy and politics -- as the one currently rolling around our nation regarding the president's ""stimulus"" plan takes place, emotion often takes precedence over fact. Words are ripped out of context, motives ascribed where none may exist, political strategies implemented with limited regard for actuality. This, then, is the playing field we step onto -- as it has long been. But, as those in South Carolina have often heard me say, it is important to disagree without being disagreeable. So let's take a clear-eyed look at Paul Begala's recent defense of the president, which happened to refer to me by name -- because what I and others have suggested is far from ""doing nothing."" First, dispense with the notion that there are simply two options here: Support the stimulus package or do nothing. The Washington Post debunked that idea quite convincingly earlier this week. In truth, there are a variety of options outside a spending bill of unprecedented scope available in this time of considerable economic distress, including, but not limited to, cutting the payroll tax, opening foreign markets through an expansion of our trade agreements, and reducing our corporate tax, which is among the highest worldwide. Second, we should all be skeptical of any argument centered on the idea of doing something for doing something's sake. We can't focus on the why and simply ignore the what. And what does this particular rendition of ""doing something"" actually do? According to the Congressional Budget Office, the effects of the bill on job growth as early as 2011 would be miniscule. More distressingly, CBO's long-term projections estimate that due to ""crowding out of private investment,"" the package will result in a reduction of our GDP as early as 2019. As for the jobs created in the short-term, what's the cost? The Heritage Foundation crunched the president's own numbers and came up with this startling figure: for every single job the bill creates, American taxpayers will spend $223,000. Examining the bill's contents makes clear just how foolhardy that is. What stimulant effect will we get from the $180 million of spending on ""diplomatic and consular services?"" Should taxpayers really be doling out $300 million for what one newspaper described as ""streamlined golf carts?"" And, even though it didn't make it into the final version of the bill, why would anyone even consider letting the very investment bankers whose companies just pulled down a few hundred million dollars in TARP funds to be in line to receive a $15,000 government credit for buying a new Hamptons beach house? Finally, history shows us quite clearly that a government cannot spend its way out of an economic downturn. It didn't work in Japan in the 1990s, when the 10 stimulus packages implemented over an eight year period failed to prevent the ""lost decade."" And the New Deal, which the president's supporters are so quick to point to? Here are the thoughts of Henry Morgenthau, FDR's Treasury Secretary: ""We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. ... I say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started ... And an enormous debt to boot!"" The president's stimulus represents the largest and most invasive economic action in our government's history. For a relatively small number of short-term jobs, this administration and this Congress are poised to mortgage the economic future of my four boys and the millions of young Americans just like them. To me, that's simply not a morally acceptable outcome. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Sanford.","Mark Sanford: Opposing the stimulus isn't an argument for doing nothing .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Twenty-two people, mainly children below the age of 5, have died of measles in Zimbabwe, the country's state media reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) said two weeks ago it was ""deeply frustrated"" by the measles outbreak, which came after it sponsored a vaccination program in the African nation. WHO's head in Zimbabwe, Dr. Custodia Mandlhate, told journalists in Harare the outbreak has totaled more than 340 suspected cases this year, and ""this is not acceptable."" She said the outbreak came about ""mainly because of people who have denied their children vaccination."" The Herald on Tuesday reported the 22 victims had not been vaccinated, quoting health officials in the troubled country. Ninety cases have been confirmed nationwide, Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare Minister Henry Madzorera told the newspaper. ""This is an unwarranted loss of lives given the fact that measles is a preventable disease,"" he said, according to the state-owned Herald. ""In Zimbabwe, outbreaks of measles were rare because of sustained high vaccination coverage among all children. It is therefore important for parents to realize that vaccinating their children protects the individual children"" from the disease and its complications,"" he said. The outbreak has hit five districts in Zimbabwe, Madzorera said. It is likely to further strain Zimbabwe's health system, which last year linked nearly 5,000 deaths to a cholera epidemic. In the past three months, five people have died from cholera, but the WHO said the situation will not be as bad as last year.","Twenty-two people, mainly children aged below 5, die of measles in Zimbabwe .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan man accused of gunning down an unarmed young woman on his front porch took the stand in his own defense Monday. Theodore Wafer, 55, told jurors he feared for his life when loud banging on his front and kitchen doors startled him awake in the early morning hours of November 2, 2013. Wafer is facing charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter for killing 19-year-old Renisha McBride, who prosecutors said was on Wafer's porch in Dearborn Heights seeking help after a car accident. On the stand, Wafer said he thinks of McBride daily. ""This poor girl, she had her whole life in front of her,"" he said, wiping his eyes. He could face life in prison if convicted. McBride had a blood-alcohol level of 0.218 at the time of her death and had smoked marijuana earlier in the evening, according to testimony. Witnesses said she crashed her vehicle into a parked car just before 1 a.m. and wandered off disoriented and bloodied. Some three hours later, she was hit in the face by a fatal shotgun blast on Wafer's porch. The incident sparked protest and drew the attention of activist Al Sharpton, likened by some to the shooting of unarmed Florida teen Trayvon Martin in 2012. McBride was African-American. Wafer, who is white, was criminally charged more than two weeks after the killing. In the Detroit courtroom Monday, Wafer described feeling the floor vibrate under his feet from the violent banging, which moved back and forth between the front and kitchen doors. He said he couldn't find his cell phone to call 911, but retrieved his Mossberg 12-guage shotgun from a closet and opened the front door at a quiet moment. ""I was not going to cower. I didn't want to be a victim in my own house,"" he said. Wafer claimed he had forgotten the weapon was loaded and hoped only to scare the trespassers. When a figure appeared from around the corner, he said, he pulled the trigger as a ""reflex reaction"" due to fear: ""It was them or me."" Earlier in the trial, prosecutors called police witnesses who said they found no pry marks, kick marks or damage to the locking mechanisms of the front door. Wayne County Medical Examiner Dr. Kilak Kesha testified he saw no injuries to McBride's hands during her autopsy that could have been caused by violent pounding. A defense expert disputed that characterization. Dr. Werner Spitz, who held the medical examiner's post in Wayne County for 16 years, told jurors he in fact saw injury, swelling and fresh blood in a photograph of McBride's hand, saying those were not the products of the car wreck hours earlier. Wafer's attorneys also called to the stand crime scene reconstructionist David Balash, who testified the screen in Wafer's front door was already damaged and knocked out of its frame when Wafer fired through it. The distance from the muzzle of Wafer's weapon to McBride's face, said Balash, would have been no more than two feet. Throughout the case, defense attorneys have fought to admit cell phone ""selfies"" of McBride taken weeks before the incident, that they say point to criminal and aggressive tendencies. The selfies show the teen ""flashing hand signals and exhibiting 'wannabe' elements of gang culture,"" with ""piles of marijuana and packaging materials indicating marijuana distribution,"" with wads of cash and pointing a handgun at the camera, according to court documents. Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Dana Hathaway has not allowed the photographs despite repeated motions by the defense. Starting her cross examination Monday afternoon, Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Athina Siringas questioned whether Wafer's tears on the stand were genuine and played a lengthy video of his police interview done within hours of the shooting. ""Do you remember ever crying within two to three hours after you shot Renisha McBride?"" she asked. ""No, I don't think so,"" replied Wafer. ""You didn't cry, right?"" continued Siringas. ""There's no jury there?"" Her cross examination of Wafer will continue Tuesday morning.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A senior operative of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula wanted for his role in the USS Cole bombing was killed by an airstrike in Yemen on Sunday, Yemeni officials said. Fahd al Quso, 37, was killed while riding in a vehicle in the Rafdh district in Shabwa province, according to the officials. He was killed by a CIA drone strike, U.S. officials told CNN. Al Qaeda members confirmed the death in text messages to local media, saying al Quso died along with a companion identified as Fahd Lakdum. Drone strike kills 13 suspected militants last week . Al Quso was indicted by a federal grand jury in New York in 2003 on 50 counts of terrorism offenses for his role in the October 12, 2000, bombing of the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen. The bombing killed 17 U.S. sailors. The FBI had offered a $5 million reward for any information leading to the capture of Al Quso, who was among the most-wanted terrorists in Yemen. He had been at-large since escaping in April 2003 with eight others from a Yemeni prison, where they had been held on suspicion of involvement in the Cole bombing. Earlier Sunday, two security officials told CNN that four Yemeni airstrikes killed six suspected al Qaeda militants and wounded two others in Lawder district of Abyan province. The Defense Ministry said that 10 other suspected militants had been killed since Saturday morning in the same province's Zinjibar district. The ministry said that the strikes were targeting two locations: a militant hideout and a training site. Nine troops were wounded in Abyan's capital of Zinjibar when a mortar exploded, a senior Defense Ministry official told CNN. Two of the wounded were in critical condition, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the news media. Local security officials said that the offensive has been the fiercest since last year, when the country began its anti-terrorism efforts. More than 240 militants have been killed over the last month in Abyan alone, the security officials said. ""Al Qaeda has been greatly weakened over the last two months, and we expect them to evacuate strategic positions over the next two weeks,"" a senior official in Abyan who is not authorized to speak to the news media told CNN on condition of anonymity. He said that 24 soldiers were killed during the same period. Yemeni government military planes roam the skies of Abyan throughout the day, residents said. ""We wake up in the morning and see bodies laying on roads or near our farms. Most of the attacks take place late at night or early morning,"" said Yasser al-Numairi, a resident of Abyan. The violence comes as newly elected President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi has vowed to increase the pressure on al Qaeda until they are eradicated from every Yemeni village. ""Our fight against al Qaeda will continue until the displaced citizens can return safely to their homes and terrorist operatives surrender and lay their arms,"" Hadi said Saturday night in a speech broadcast on Yemen Television. The Interior Ministry said on Sunday that 14 suspected al Qaeda militants were arrested in April and that it will continue hunting down terrorists nationwide. Al Qaeda is seeking to take advantage of the political unrest in Yemen to expand into new areas of southern Yemen. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Fahd al Quso was killed while riding in a vehicle, Yemeni officials say .

"(CNN) -- The former New York nightclub hostess who gained fame when she was named as one of golfer Tiger Woods' alleged mistresses could soon be helping clients track cheating spouses. Rachel Uchitel graduates from the DGA Detectives Academy in Los Angeles next month, according to school director Dale Gustafson. ""She's smart,"" Gustafson said Wednesday. ""One of her strengths is field interviews and getting information from people."" A job with Gustafson's agency is waiting for Uchitel, he said. ""She's expressed an interest in doing that, but it's still up in the air."" Uchitel, halfway through the 10-week course, has already studied asset recovery, criminal defense, family law, skip tracing and missing persons investigations, he said. ""I have a feeling she's going to be specializing in missing persons,"" he said. ""She really does have a strength there."" Next week's classes will focus on personal injury investigations, he said. In the days after Woods was injured in a November 2009 car crash in his Florida neighborhood, rumors surfaced about an alleged affair between the golfer and Uchitel. She initially denied the relationship and has refused to publicly talk about it. Before starting the detective training, Uchitel was a cast member of the current season of TV's ""Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.""

"(CNN) -- A 13-year-old Minnesota boy who has cancer has resumed chemotherapy treatments and is not responding well, a family spokesman said Friday. Doctors say Daniel Hauser's lymphoma responded well to a first round of chemotherapy in February. Danny Hauser started a second round of chemotherapy treatment this week, Jim Navarro said in a statement on the family's Web site, dannyhauser.com. ""The doctor changed the number of chemotherapy drugs in the protocol submitted to the court. Danny is not tolerating the drugs well and has been vomiting all day. He is understandably angry and depressed about being forced to go through the ravages of chemotherapy again."" Daniel underwent his first round of chemotherapy in February, a month after he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. But his parents were concerned about the treatment's side effects, which typically include nausea, and decided to end the chemotherapy regimen and pursue holistic treatments instead. When Daniel's oncologist learned of the decision to reject standard treatment, which doctors say is associated with a cure rate of as high as 90 percent, he asked a court to intervene to ensure the teen got chemotherapy. Doctors say that, without it, the disease would likely prove fatal. But last week, before the court could act, Colleen Hauser packed up her son and flew with him to Southern California, from where they were planning to continue to Mexico to seek alternative alternative medical treatment. She said he would have run on his own had she not helped him flee. She changed her mind before crossing the border and returned this week with Daniel to Minnesota, where the family agreed to comply with whatever treatment the court ordered. A medical examination revealed that the boy's tumor had grown since he was diagnosed and the boy's doctor recommended he resume chemotherapy. After examining the boy on Monday, Dr. Michael Richards estimated the tumor's size at 5.3 inches by 5.1 inches by 6.3 inches, and said it was ""protruding outside the chest wall."" He said initiation this week of standard chemotherapy treatment was ""imperative."" Richards recommended at least another five cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiation, and added that the ""goal will be to include alternative therapies in which the family is interested, as long as there is not data to suggest that a particular danger exists with any alternative medicine."" District Court Judge John Rodenberg originally took custody of the boy away from his parents, but returned him to his family on the condition that they comply with the recommendations of the cancer specialist. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which is part of the immune system. As the disease progresses, it compromises a body's ability to fight infection.

"(CNN) -- Billy Joel's daughter with Christie Brinkley fainted on a New York cabaret stage Saturday, her rep said Monday. An emergency room doctor concluded that Alexa Ray Joel, 28, experienced vasovagal syncope, a common cause of fainting that ""is usually harmless and requires no treatment,"" Joel rep Claire Mercuri said. In vasovagal syncope, according to the Mayo Clinic website, a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure can cause reduced blood flow to the brain, which results in a brief loss of consciousness. Joel was performing to a sold-out crowd at The Café Carlyle on Manhattan's Upper East Side when she collapsed and was rushed to the emergency room at New York Presbyterian Hospital, Mercuri said. ""Ms. Joel was taken ill earlier in the afternoon and announced from stage that she pulled out her back and neck, but wanted the show to go on,"" she said. It was closing night of her two-week run at the venue. ""I wanted to thank everyone for coming out to support me,"" Joel said Monday.  ""I was excited and determined to fulfill my final performance and I really wanted to end my run with a bang, but this was not what I had in mind and hope I have the opportunity to make it up to the wonderful audience very soon."" The songwriter and singer launched her performance and recording career in 2006. Alexa Ray Joel speaks up on depression . She suffered from what she called ""heartbreak-related depression"" after a break up with longtime boyfriend and former bandmate Jimmy Riot in 2010. She was rushed to a New York hospital on December 5, 2009, after swallowing a handful of homeopathic pain pills, her publicist confirmed at the time. The pills were not considered to be life-threatening. After media reports suggested that her depression was sparked by a fight with her mother, Christie Brinkley, the former model and her ex-husband Billy Joel released a public denial. ""As much as we hate dignifying tabloid stories with a response, we feel we must set the record straight,"" Joel and Brinkley said in 2009. ""Every parent can imagine the pain and anguish ... of a daughter who is working to recover from the dangerous actions she took while suffering a devastating heartbreak.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson's music sales keep soaring as fans purchased more than 800,000 of his albums last week, Billboard magazine said. Fans sign a memorial wall for Michael Jackson this week near the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. Jackson's albums hold all 10 top positions on Billboard's top pop catalog albums chart, according Nielsen SoundScan sales data released Wednesday. That feat broke a record Jackson set last week when he had eight albums on that chart. Jackson's albums are not eligible for the Billboard 200 chart, which is for newer albums. Jackson's ""Number Ones"" sold a whooping 339,000 copies last week. Two other Jackson albums, ""Thriller"" and ""The Essential Michael Jackson,"" sold more than 150,000 copies.  Watch family, friends and fans pay tribute » . Physical albums constituted 82 percent of Jackson's sales last week -- 656,000 of those versus 144,000 download albums.

But the ""King of Pop"" still had five singles on the Top 10 list of digital downloads.

"(CNN) -- It was just after lunchtime, and 17 kindergartners huddled around a table marked with paint. Teacher Lindy Shoemaker held a vase covered in small objects: an ""I <3 Tennis"" keychain, a LEGO flag and other goodies the students brought from home. It might seem like any art class, but the students' piece was inspired by the work of folk artist Howard Finster. The children knew about his colorful, eclectic art because they'd seen them up close that day at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. This, their teachers said, is the kind of learning that happens only when schools cut out the classroom and take learning on the road. In late February, students from the independent, private Galloway School in Atlanta spent the entire school day inside the museum. It was closed to the public but wide open to Galloway's 750 students, ages 3 to 18, for a day of ""school without walls."" This was no ordinary field trip, school leaders said. A museum visit typically means a bus ride, a few hours for students to observe the same exhibit, and a lot of reminders to stay quiet and not touch anything. On this day, hundreds of students, teachers and staff members flooded the museum, wearing white T-shirts with red logos that read ""HIGH Energy."" Movement and noise filled the wings as teachers and students explored lessons in art, music, history, geometry, physics -- all of them designed by teachers in collaboration with the museum's education department. The experience pushed the boundaries of the usual field trip, Galloway Head of School Suzanna Jemsby said, even in an era when many schools are cutting trips entirely. The school was ""rethinking about it as a carnival of learning,"" Jemsby said. ""There will be chaos, and that belongs to experiential learning, and that is what we're looking for. We're looking for a hubbub of activity and student inquiry."" Teaching from reality . The idea for the ""school without walls"" started simply, with a meeting of the Galloway School leader and the museum director. By allowing students to visit on a Monday, when the museum is typically closed, they could assure more freedom and security for students while still relying on the education and catering staff, they decided. Teachers visited during a professional development day and worked with the museum's education department to design courses that paired existing exhibits with lessons their students would need even in their regular classrooms. The final schedule spanned 87 sessions for students in pre-K through high school, far more than could be offered during a standard school day, sometimes allowing teachers to break out of their typical subject matter. At the museum, Galloway health and physical education teacher Denny Beatty led a session about the civil rights movement called ""Walking in Someone Else's Shoes."" Bayless Fleming's students searched for shapes in the museum and wrote riddles that incorporated math vocabulary. Jemsby, the school leader, explored the color blue with young students. Museum workers pitched in, too: Director Michael Shapiro analyzed work by Western bronze artist Frederic Remington while Rhonda Matheison explained the business model for museums. ""Teachers had to think outside the box, teach from real things, teach in different ways than they have before, so it's a big growth experience for them,"" said Virginia Shearer, director of education at the High Museum. ""The difference is that students get to see the real thing up close and personal, and they get to connect all of that background learning to the real thing."" READ: Students, say goodbye to snow days . It didn't take long for teachers to zero in on unique learning opportunities or for students to break out of a desk-and-classroom mindset. ""They're much more excited by the learning, so it'll stick with them more,"" teacher Susan O'Shields said. The hardest part, some teachers said, was to remember what to pack: Without their usual classroom supplies available, they had to plan ahead. ""We kept being like, 'Oh, we need to get this. Oh, we need to pack that,' "" Fleming said. The value of a field trip . Gas costs, budget cuts and jam-packed school days loaded with tests have all cut back on field trips that used to dot educational calendars. But if schools find a willing partner, they could easily replicate the idea behind the ""school with no walls,"" Shearer said. Some schools are turning to technology, using Google Glass or Skype to take students to faraway places they couldn't otherwise go. But even visits to local cultural institutions can hold tangible educational value, said Brian Kisida, an education reform researcher at the University of Arkansas' College of Education and Health Professions. In a recent study involving nearly 11,000 students from 123 schools, he found that students who visited the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, demonstrated stronger critical thinking skills, higher levels of social tolerance and greater historical empathy than those who didn't. They also developed a taste for art museums and cultural institutions. He found that benefits were even greater for students who came from high poverty or rural schools, minority students and those who had never before visited a museum. Those students are especially reliant on their schools to provide those experiences, he said. Some have come to see field trips and time in cultural institutions as ""unnecessary frills,"" Kisida said, that slice away at time needed to maximize test scores. He says they're not. ""Schools certainly have to deal with tight budgets, but they also have to prioritize different ways of spending their resources,"" Kisida said. ""If school leaders are able to see the benefits of these types of trips, they might be able to prioritize them."" Kisida hadn't heard of other schools hosting entire days of school at museums, but some programs are trying to emphasize learning outside the classroom, like the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum School Partnership Program in Boston and Embarc in Chicago, he said. ""It's a great thing that should be replicated and serve as a model for other institutions and schools looking to expand the types of learning that they're doing for their students,"" he said. READ: Would you want Google Glass in your child's school? Sherri Breunig, a former public school teacher who's now the director of communications for the Galloway School, said she can understand why some schools would be reluctant to try an entire school day away from the classroom: Worry about ""what-ifs"" can get in the way of experiments, she said. ""There's an element of fear, whether it's an independent or a public school, that they have to stay within the lines when working with kids,"" she said. ""You don't have to be bound by these artificial lines when it comes to educating kids."" Nourishing the learning process . Throughout the day, the museum was busy not with the usual crowds but with fifth-graders stretching in their movement class, sixth-graders pounding drums and first-graders painting polygons on T-shirts. Cutting out the classroom took some getting used to for some students. First-grader Jake Isenberg commented that he liked the size and variety of shapes inside the museum, while his classmate Nate Oertell said he preferred their regular classroom because it ""feels like more time at school."" Sixth-graders Vivi Malkonian and Lily Siegel, who went to sessions about African-American art, music and photography, agreed that the museum took them outside their comfort zones. ""At school, we've been there forever, and we know it like the back of our hand, but here you get to explore and see new things you've never seen before,"" Malkonian said. ""I got to see a lot of new students I haven't worked with and their outlooks on the art,"" Siegel said. READ: How one teacher is innovating his classroom . Some high school students enjoyed the environment, but with their minds already geared toward college, a day in the museum didn't always help much. High school freshman Alexander Nieves said he saw some limitations to the event. He and his classmates are used to to the speed of laptops and other technology to move them efficiently through material, and with some students minds' already on college, they struggled to connect with the offerings. Personally, he enjoyed the challenge. ""In school, you're really just sitting down in a chair getting exercises drilled into your head, but this really allowed creative flow,"" said Nieves, 15. ""The main idea of school is to prepare someone for life, and the best way to do that is to not have the same environment. Experimenting with different environments gives students a sense of a new area and working and learning in different ways."" ""Variety,"" he said, ""nourishes the learning process.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A huge storm that collapsed part of a cliff on Israel's central coast led to the discovery of a statue dating back to the Roman period, the Israel Antiquities Authority said Tuesday. The white marble statue of a woman wearing a toga and sandals is estimated to be 2,000 years old. It stands 1.2 meters tall, weighs about 200 kilograms and was found with no head or arms, according to a news release by the authority. A person walking on the shore of the southern city of Ashkelon made the discovery, the authority said. ""The statue fell into the sea when the ancient maritime cliff collapsed as a result of the storm,"" said Yigal Israel, the Ashkelon district archaeologist. ""The collapse also ruined a bath house and mosaics that had been in the cliff for many hundreds of years."" The storm, one of the strongest Israel has experienced in recent years, brought winds of more than 100 kph that sent 10-meter waves crashing into Israel's coast.","The statue of a woman dates back about 2,000 years .

"(CNN) -- You can keep them for only a week. But T-Mobile is handing out free iPhones, along with a trial run of its cellular service, in the latest in a string of unorthodox promotions for the No. 4 wireless carrier in the United States. Through ""T-Mobile Test Drive,"" curious consumers will get an iPhone 5S loaner and seven days of unlimited data to check out the service. Starting Monday, people can sign up for the program online. If they're not impressed, they can drop the phone off at any T-Mobile store, at no charge. People must give T-Mobile a valid credit card number to get a phone. If they return a cracked or water-damaged phone, they're billed $100. If they don't return the phone at all, they're billed $700, plus tax. In trying to crack the Top Three, T-Mobile has taken on the mantel of ""The Uncarrier"" under the guidance of CEO John Legere, a nontraditional business executive if ever there was one. Witness his slightly off-color quote promoting the new deal: . ""The way this industry forces Americans to buy wireless is completely, utterly broken. I'm here to tell you there's a better way,"" he said. ""While the carriers ask you to buy blind, the Uncarrier gives you transparency. Our network kicks ass, and now people can experience for themselves what a data-strong network can do with T-Mobile Test Drive."" Since March 2013, T-Mobile has eliminated binding contracts and launched deals like Jump, which lets customers upgrade phones twice a year for a modest fee instead of once every two years. On Wednesday, the carrier also announced that it would let customers stream unlimited music via Pandora, Spotify and other services without it counting against their data plans. And that's in addition to Legere, known for sporting a pink T-Mobile t-shirt under a suit nearly every time he's in public, engaging in stunts like crashing AT&T's private concert for developers at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. This newly aggressive push comes even as Sprint, the third-place U.S. carrier behind AT&T and Verizon, is reported to be working on a plan to buy out T-Mobile for as much as $20 billion.

"(CNN) -- The ""King of Pop"" had been topping music charts long before he ever pulled on that white-sequined glove, made the moonwalk a household move and sent screaming fans into a frenzy. In spite of all of the rumors and his ""Wacko Jacko"" persona, Jackson's musical draw remained strong. But the spotlight that followed Michael Jackson, earned him headlines and made him a tabloid favorite as an adult, often had little to do with the artistry. While filming a commercial for Pepsi in 1984, a pyrotechnic accident set his hair ablaze, leaving him with second-degree burns on his scalp and igniting what would eventually became an odyssey of reconstructive work. Rumors about his face, the ever-changing nose and lightening skin fueled the ""Wacko Jacko"" persona, a moniker he'd be given later and seem to embrace. There was, for instance, Bubbles, a chimpanzee he adopted, befriended and allowed to share his toilet. Jackson didn't fight and even perpetuated claims, even though they weren't true, that he'd bought the remains of The Elephant Man and slept in a hyperbaric chamber -- although he would deny both years later during an interview with Oprah Winfrey. It was then, in that 1993 interview, that he also shot down rumors that he was dying his skin to make it lighter. Instead, he spoke for the first time about having vitiligo, a skin pigmentation disorder. iReport.com: Share your favorite Jackson memory . Meantime, he had designed his dream home, the Neverland Ranch in Santa Ynez, California, as if he were the Peter Pan he so admired. Replete with a zoo, his own amusement park and the bevy of children who surrounded, played and sometimes slept over with him, he proudly set out to recapture the childhood he publicly said he'd never had. Allegations of what went on privately, however, landed him in a big-boy pool of legal hot water. He was accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old boy. Soon after came talk about his addiction to prescription drugs. He settled the civil lawsuit with the accusing family in 1994 and was never charged criminally. Then came the shocking, albeit relatively short-lived, marriage to Lisa Marie Presley -- a move that set off a whole new round of speculations.  More facts about Jackson's life » . Did he tie the knot to fight the child abuse speculations that dogged him? Was this eccentric ""King"" aspiring to be the son-in-law of ""The King,"" Elvis Presley? Or could it have been true love? Despite this two-year marriage, and the reported relationships he'd had earlier with Tatum O'Neal, Stephanie Mills and Brooke Shields, Jackson remained sexually ambiguous and, in many people's eyes, sexless altogether. He'd later marry once more for several years, this time a nurse named Debbie Rowe. People debated whether they consummated that marriage or if artificial insemination played a role, but Jackson left in 1999 with custody of two children, a son known as Prince Michael and a daughter named Paris. For years when they appeared in public, the children wore veils or masks. Prince Michael II was born in 2002. An unidentified woman gave birth after reportedly being artificially inseminated with Jackson's sperm. His second son was semi-revealed to the public in Berlin, Germany, when Jackson momentarily dangled the baby, his face hidden beneath a blanket, over a balcony four stories above the ground and a mass of fans.  Watch Jackson introduce Prince Michael II » . It was yet another move that spawned talk and accusations, and it was one he'd apologize for later. In recent years there was yet another child sexual abuse accusation, one Jackson was acquitted of in May 2005. The trial was a media spectacle, and one where the fashion icon wore his pajama bottoms to court and danced atop a car. He also had enormous financial problems to deal with and narrowly escaped bankruptcy and foreclosure on his Neverland property. But in spite of all of this, Jackson's draw remained strong. More than 25 years after the release of his epic album, ""Thriller,"" it was being celebrated again. He was scheduled to start what he described at a March press conference as his ""final curtain call"" concert tour, which had recently been postponed to next year.

"(CNN) -- There's a photo of the Jackson family on the cover of the September 24, 1971, issue of Life magazine. In it, Joseph and Katherine Jackson stand at the foot of a set of stairs, their star children -- known as the Jackson 5 -- arrayed behind them. The Jackson brothers, here in the 1970s, were driven to be great by their father, Joseph. They appear to be the all-American clan, gold records arranged behind them, the boys loose and smiling, the parents more awkward and serious in their demeanor. Over the years, that façade crumbled. The brothers bickered; some made accusations of abuse. But the group remained tight-knit through crises, including Thursday's tragedy, when Michael Jackson collapsed at his house and later died at UCLA Medical Center. The journey began with music in Gary, Indiana. Joseph Jackson, the patriarch, played in a short-lived band called the Falcons (no relation to the Detroit-based group featuring Wilson Pickett) in the 1950s. His primary job, however, was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel. Katherine Jackson, the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949, tended to the couple's large family: Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Michael and Randy, all born between 1950 and 1961. Daughter Janet arrived in 1966. By that time, the three oldest boys -- Jackie, Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group, which Marlon and Michael eventually joined. Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he'd found elusive. Joseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster. He drove his sons hard, forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity. He wasn't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child, Michael. ""My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day,"" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993. He said his father also beat him: ""He was very strict, very hard, very stern. ... There's been times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick, I'd start to regurgitate."" He quickly said, imagining his father's reaction, ""Please don't be mad at me."" Joseph Jackson disputed the word ""beat,"" but didn't question Michael's account. ""I whipped him with a switch and a belt,"" he told the BBC in 2003. He added, ""I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick."" In a 2005 interview with CNN's Larry King, Jermaine defended his father's actions. ""We grew up like any other black family. You did something, you got your butt tore up, and it wasn't tore up, it was just, you got a spanking,"" he said. ""I will say this. He kept us off of the streets. He kept us away from drugs. He kept us away from gangs and ... we've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world."" By 1968, when Michael turned 10, the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine. They'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the ""chitlin circuit"" of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group. Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them ""the last big stars to come off my assembly line,"" according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site. The group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base, along with an animated TV show. But success took its toll, particularly when it wasn't so easy to come by. In the mid-1970s, the band -- minus Jermaine, who'd married Gordy's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records, where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions, which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit ""Enjoy Yourself."" ""It was a collaboration,"" Gamble said. ""They all participated in creating. Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians."" Huff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting, complete with a ""fantastic meal"" cooked by Katherine Jackson. ""I've got nothing but respect for the father,"" added Gamble. ""He's a great man. He made something out of nothing."" Even during that era, however, Michael was standing out. Gamble and Huff recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded. Going solo with Quincy Jones producing, as he did in 1979, was the right move, Gamble and Huff said. The family dynamics kept changing as the siblings grew older. After Michael's ""Thriller"" became the biggest album of all time, the brothers -- including Jermaine -- regrouped for a new album, ""Victory,"" and accompanying tour. But Michael, now the undisputed draw, disagreed with some of the tour plans and ended up donating his earnings to charity. Michael's brightened spotlight boosted the careers of his siblings; even Rebbie had a hit. But it was Janet who broke out with the most success, including the No. 1 singles ""Miss You Much,"" ""Black Cat"" and ""Again"" in the 1980s and '90s. With the increased interest in the Jacksons came tabloid scrutiny of the family's every move. When La Toya appeared nude in Playboy magazine, the story made headlines. She later criticized Michael and was on the outs for several years. Jermaine put out a song called ""Word to the Badd,"" an attack on Michael, in 1991; he later changed the lyrics. Janet's relationships were probed in detail, as were the brothers' marriages. And Michael, of course, was seen as increasingly eccentric, his personality overwhelming his music. But for all their own bickering, the family closed ranks when a member was attacked. In 1992, Jermaine co-produced ""The Jacksons: An American Dream,"" a TV miniseries based on Katherine Jackson's memoir, which chronicled their rise to stardom. When Michael faced molestation allegations in the early '90s and was tried in 2005, the family rallied around. ""The Jackson family was groomed to be a team,"" said Linda Johnson Rice, president and CEO of Ebony and Jet magazines' Johnson Publishing and a longtime family friend. ""As you can see through their performances, they were always there for each other."" In recent years, La Toya has appeared on the reality shows ""Armed and Famous"" and the UK ""Celebrity Big Brother."" She originally had a scene in the forthcoming Sacha Baron Cohen movie, ""Bruno,"" but CNN confirmed the scene has been cut, ""out of respect for Jackson's family,"" the studio told The (UK) Guardian. Jermaine, who converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Abdul-Aziz, appeared on ""Celebrity Big Brother"" in 2007. Jackie runs a record label, Tito remains involved in the music business, and according to a 2008 article in the New York Post, Marlon and Randy have struggled financially. In the hospital emergency room Thursday, Randy and Jermaine were witnessed hugging and crying over their late brother. ""We're a family,"" Jermaine told Larry King in the 2005 interview. ""We're no different than any other family who has feuds and problems. ... But at the same time, we're united, and we have a united front that is very, very strong, and it's supported by God. ""My mother and father did a great job in instilling the morals and principles in us from the very beginning. We feel that with that, that's all you need to go through life."" CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this article.","Jackson family has been in spotlight along with Michael .

"Dubai, UAE (CNN) -- Call it a perfect market storm of wealth creation. Since the start of 2013, the Dubai stock market has registered a near 200% gain to become the best performing financial market in the world. The Gulf emirate's securing of the World Expo in 2020 is likely one factor behind this success as is the wider UAE's reputation as a safe-haven in a region riddled with uncertainty. Oil averaging more than $100 a barrel for three years running, meanwhile, is driving growth towards record spending on infrastructure. The UAE has ""a strong balance sheet"" and lot of ""promising prospects,"" said Alia Moubayed, research director at Barclays when asked about the reasons behind investor bullishness over the last 18 months. Some even believe there's more to come before the Dubai Index tops out. ""The Dow Jones exceeded 165,000 points,"" said veteran Dubai trader Zakaria Al-Assar. ""Still, Dubai (is at) 5,000, we are looking for more, inshallah."" These strong expectations have led to an upgrade for the UAE from the riskier investor category of frontier market to emerging market by financial index firm, MSCI. Alongside neighboring Qatar, which was also upgraded this week, the UAE is now considered by MSCI to have the same investment status as the likes of China and Brazil. This change while likely increase investor confidence in the region leading to an increased flow of investment dollars into the Persian Gulf states. ""You will get a level of comfort as an EM (emerging market) fund manager when you are upgraded to this level,"" said head of equities at NBAD Asset Management, Saleem Khokhar. ""On top of that you will see more and more institutions beginning to play in this space so yes it is a game changer but don't bring it into a short time frame."" Achieving emerging market status has been a long journey for both Qatar and the UAE. The UAE has been knocking on the door since 2009. But some fund managers suggest this delay actually helped the country's markets and companies mature. Nine companies will represent the UAE in the MSCI index, including property groups Aldar, Arabtec and Emaar. The gigantic port company DP World and the Dubai Financial Market itself will also feature. Yet with recognition comes attention and volatility. The trading floors in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha may be quaint, with limited trading sessions, but they are active. On the day CNN visited the Dubai exchange, banking stocks were trading up 15% after a wild correction earlier in the month. ""You have to remember just a couple of weeks ago we went through quite a correction and a number of blue chip stocks we were looking at came down between 20-30%,"" said Khokhar. After being overlooked for many years, these markets are just coming into focus for many international investors. Expect more bumps, shocks and opportunities along the way.","Dubai stock market is best performing in world over last 18 months .

"(CNN) -- It's been more than a week since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 seemingly vanished into thin air. Clues are few and far between. Yet we remain glued to the story -- hungry, some almost desperate, for any tidbit of news. Why? ""I think the most fascinating aspect of this story now is that it's become ... transcendent. And by that, I mean, it's no longer a story about an airplane crash; it's a mystery story,"" Patrick Smith, an airline pilot, blogger and author, told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" The story of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has dominated headlines and social media since it broke. By Sunday night, it was no longer trending on Twitter in the United States, but it remained among the top stories in Malaysia and India. Folks are using the hashtag #MH370 to connect. And people are doing more than just watching, or reading, the news. They're getting involved. Thousands of aspiring good Samaritans volunteered their time to scour part of the plane's search zone using detailed satellite images posted online by DigitalGlobe, a Colorado firm that owns one of the world's most advanced commercial satellite networks. In fact, so many people joined the effort that the firm's website -- with its pinpoint pictures of everything floating in the ocean -- crashed. One volunteer, Mike Seberger, 43, found a fascinating image in a matter of minutes: the silhouette in the ocean has the scale of a Boeing 777-200, the same model of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. His discovery can be seen on his CNN iReport page. It's both the flight's commonness and its rareness that might have us gripped. One the one hand, many people travel by plane who can relate easily to the experience of flying. Until the mystery is solved, who among us isn't going to jump the next time we're on a plane and feel a bump of turbulence? That's what happened to Brian Stelter, host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" ""We tend to identify with these kinds of disasters, and so the fear of flying may go up for many people,"" psychiatrist Gail Saltz said on that program. On the other hand, cases such as the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 are extremely rare. ""This is a very strange event,"" said aviation historian Carroll Gray. ""It doesn't lend itself to the normal sets of explanations."" Such mysteries are ""phenomenally gripping,"" Gray said. ""Things that are unsolved just sort of grab people, especially when you have the common experience of flying."" Saltz agreed. ""They want someone to hold accountable. It's a very disturbing thought, and right now we can't figure out who's to blame,"" she said. The psychiatrist summed up our fascination: ""I think this nebulousness keeps us riveted.""

"(CNN) -- Few have had a bigger influence on today's musical artists than Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson performs with Usher in September 2001 at Madison Square Gardens in New York City. Younger singers, from Justin Timberlake to Usher and Chris Brown, have emulated his dance moves, his look and his sound. He was, for many, the ultimate performer. ""[His influence] feels like something that is instilled and embedded in anyone who wanted to create anything musically,"" said Marsha Ambrosius, one half of the duo Floetry that wrote the single ""Butterflies."" That single appeared on Jackson's 2001 ""Invincible"" album. ""He will always be the King of Pop, and no one will ever be able to fill those shoes with those shiny socks and that glove,"" Ambrosius said. For many of the younger generation, he was the first to not just cross over but  explode onto the pop charts from the R & B scene. His phenomenal talent and worldwide appeal made his throne one to be aspired to even as they stood in awe of him. ""If you're a singer and you don't want to be like Michael Jackson, something is wrong,"" said 19-year-old singer and rapper Sean Kingston, who scored a hit in 2007 with the song ""Beautiful Girls."" ""He's a huge influence."" Sonia Murray, a longtime Atlanta-based music columnist, said Jackson was for the younger set what James Brown had been for Jackson: an inspiration. ""It was the many dimensions he had as a performer,"" Murray said. ""A lot of those artists strive to be all around entertainers. Michael looks to James Brown and Sammy Davis Jr. and for the younger guys, he was the closest thing they had."" His music videos were must-see TV, and aspiring artists learned that it took more than just holding a microphone if they really wanted to make it big. ""He was the total package,"" said Gail Mitchell, senior editor for R & B and Hip-hop for Billboard. ""I was talking to somebody the other day about what trends they were seeing, and they said that a lot of the acts these days seem to going back to the whole entertainer thing."" ""It's not just good enough anymore to lip-synch or program your computer, but some of these newer artists are more concerned about putting on a great show for their fans."" Steve Greenberg, founder and CEO of S-Curve Records, was a disc jokey in Tel Aviv, Israel, when ""Thriller"" first dropped and witnessed first-hand how Jackson became an international icon. Greenberg said Jackson ""influenced everyone who has come after him."" ""He's been around so long that everyone on the contemporary scene has come after him,"" Greenberg said. ""His was the first very contemporary, very exciting dance music to emerge after the death of disco."" His was a global appeal, Greenberg said, among fans and artists worldwide. ""He was as big in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as he was in America and Europe,"" Greenberg said. ""He had that universality that not many people had. The Beatles had it, Muhammad Ali had it, but not many other people have had it."" His music also crossed genres. He was a favorite of rappers to sample and working with him was a badge of honor in the industry. Producer Dallas Austin worked with him on Michael Jackson's ""HIStory: Past, Present and Future"" and, like the rest of the world, was stunned by his death. ""Michael Jackson was a magical person to work with,"" Austin said in a released statement. ""I am saddened by his death. The world won't be the same without him."" Even for the most hardcore in hip-hop, there was no shame in admitting love for the King of Pop. ""Michael Jackson has always been an inspiration to me as far as his music is concerned,"" Rapper Snoop Dogg told MTV in 2001. ""You can't take nothing from him."" Wyclef Jean released a statement saying ""Michael Jackson was my Musical God."" ""He made me believe that all things are possible, and through real and positive music, he can live forever,"" Jean said. ""I love Michael Jackson. God Bless him."" Floetry member Marsha Ambrosius said she felt blessed to have spent two weeks working with Jackson in New York City a few years ago after he fell in love with a song she had written. She had the opportunity to get to know him, not just as a superstar, but as a fun-loving family man who stayed in touch with her even after the project was finished. ""He was one of the most amazing people you would ever want to meet ,"" she said. ""I can say I worked with the most incredible artist on planet Earth.""

"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- You expect a motorist to shell out a little extra cash for a vanity license plate. Number 5 fetched $6.75 million, now the UAE is likely to set another record. But nowhere is the craze for a unique plate more intense than in the United Arab Emirates, the oil-rich Persian Gulf nation that holds the world record for the six most expensive plates. Here, it's all about how low you can go -- with people battling it out at auctions to win the chance to show off license plates with the lowest digit. The numbers ""5"" and ""7"" have already been snapped up, sold for 25 million dirhams ($6.75 million) and 11 million dirhams ($2.97 million) respectively. Next week, the country will put up for auction the mother of all vanity plates: the number ""1."" It is expected to immediately set a new record for the most expensive plate in the world. ""As low as the number goes, as high the price goes also,"" said Abdullah Al Mannaei, who runs the license plate auctions in the capital city, Abu Dhabi. ""If it's a two-digit number, if it's similar like '99' or '22,' that goes (for) a higher amount."" It's no surprise that license plate craze has such a grip on the United Arab Emirates. The tiny nation, slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Maine, is prone to thinking big. It is already home to the world's largest mall, the world's largest tower, and -- despite being in the Middle East -- boasts the largest indoor snow park in the world. Talal Khouri, a stock broker in Abu Dhabi , is the proud owner of ""5"" and ""7."" He sheepishly admits that yes, it's a status thing. The license plate ""5"" hangs from his shiny red Rolls Royce. An expensive car, but still, 10 times less so than the plate itself. It's not all ego though. The money that the government raises auctioning off plates goes to a fund that helps victims of car accidents. Abu Dhabi has held five such auctions, selling 300 plates and raising an astonishing $56 million. For the business savvy, there's an added attraction: it's a good investment. ""I have a number plate on my car, which was worth 35,000 (dirhams) four years ago,"" Al Mannaei said. ""And I have an offer now for 400,000."" Khouri has his eyes set on snagging the number ""1,"" but he is being practical about how much he is willing to spend. ""Um, I (will) not pay more than, maximum 15 (to) 20,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Germany has canceled a decades-old agreement on information-sharing with Britain and the United States, in the wake of controversy sparked by American leaker Edward Snowden's disclosures about mass surveillance programs. Germany's Foreign Ministry announced the move Friday, saying it was effective immediately. Foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said cancellation of the pact -- which dates back to the late 1960s -- ""was a necessary and a correct consequence resulting from the latest debates in regards to protect privacy."" The move is largely symbolic but reflects the public pressure Germany's leaders have been under following the revelations by Snowden, a former U.S. National Security Agency contractor. Europe furious, 'shocked' by report of U.S. spying . A UK Foreign Office spokesman said the 1968 agreement had been stopped after a request from Berlin. He described the arrangement as ""a bit of a loose end"" which ""hasn't been used since at least 1990."" The issue dominated a conversation last month between President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Other European nations, including France, have also voiced concern. All nations collect intelligence, Obama says . The White House last month promised joint EU-American discussions on the collection and oversight of intelligence, and questions of privacy and data protection. The row blew up after German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that classified leaks by Snowden detailed NSA bugging of European Union offices in Washington and New York, as well as an ""electronic eavesdropping operation"" that tapped into an EU building in Brussels. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has said that Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency operates within a strong legal framework. A UK parliamentary committee found last month that media claims GCHQ had made use of a U.S. mass surveillance program known as PRISM to illegally spy on UK citizens were ""unfounded.""

"(CNN) -- That Chris Smith made an inspiring, gorgeous video of himself juggling around Iceland earlier this year, and that it's been viewed more than 700,000 times on YouTube, isn't all that surprising once you get to know him. The 28-year-old from Lake Tahoe, California, has been juggling for 16 years, performing at Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers basketball games, in Las Vegas and abroad. With his skills, it was a natural transition to audition for the Blue Man Group, which promptly cast him and sent him to perform in Blue Man theaters in New York, Chicago and Orlando, and as part of a national tour. Now in Los Angeles to pursue acting and writing (in between Blue Man fill-in work), Smith is still basking in the midnight sun of Nordic stardom. CNN: How has becoming an Internet sensation changed your life? Chris Smith: I now only eat the finest meats and drink only vintage wines. Hardly. Haha, nothing is different. I just think it's a nice feeling that people took something positive away from the video. That maybe they got to see that juggling can be more than just a guy in a sequin tie performing as an opening act for a magician. Not that there's anything wrong with that! CNNGo in Reykjavik . CNN: Is juggling a normal part of your travels or was this just a one-off bit of inspired fun? Chris Smith: Juggling is a part of my life! I always carry some beanbags around with me, but I juggle mostly just to relieve stress and have fun rather than perform. Iceland was an exception. I had just purchased a new camera and the idea struck me while I was driving around the country. It was really supposed to be a fun way to show family and friends my trip, and to try an experiment with the camera. CNN: Did your juggling attract attention from locals? Chris Smith: For the most part in Iceland, I was on my own. I did, however, have to accept the fact that I was some random dude juggling for goats in the middle of nowhere. How to be a Reykjaviker . CNN: With all the juggling near cliffs and water, did you lose any balls while shooting the video? Chris Smith: I can proudly say that I didn't lose a single one. I definitely dropped them down hills and ravines, but I managed to get them back. CNN: Juggling aside, what was the best part of Iceland? Chris Smith: The dramatic beauty of the country. I literally felt like I was on another planet. Driving around, you get this feeling sometimes like you're the only one in the world who knows this place exists. It kinda feels like a well-kept secret. 11 of Reykjavik's coolest bars . CNN: Has the popularity of this video inspired more travel/juggling projects? Chris Smith: Absolutely! I made another POV video immediately afterward that tracks my journey from Hawaii to New York City, which garnered quite a few strange looks, as there are a few more people in New York than the countryside of Iceland. CNN: How long have you been juggling? Chris Smith: Since I was 12. I learned on a family road trip to Yellowstone (National Park) as our RV kept breaking down, stranding us in repair shops across America. In a cafÃ© in the middle of nowhere I found a book called ""Juggling for the Complete Klutz"" that came with three beanbags. I begged my dad to get it for me, to which he said the magic words: ""Yeah, right. Like you'll ever use that."" The gauntlet was thrown. I haven't stopped juggling since. CNN: Do you perform live? Chris Smith: I don't perform as often as I did in college, when I was known as The UCLA Juggler. You can Google image it for a laugh. It was a position I pitched to the marching band director as a potential ""alternate option"" to a baton twirler. He went for the idea, and as a result, I ended up performing with the UCLA marching band at football and basketball games around the country. That branched out into solo performances at Lakers and Clippers games as well as some gigs in Vegas and abroad. Since doing Blue Man, I haven't had as much time. Elf School spills secrets of Iceland's 'Hidden People' CNN: How many countries have you been to? Chris Smith: Probably 20. CNN: Best country/destination for juggling? Chris Smith: That's tough to say. Iceland is obviously up there because of the response to the video, but I'd probably have to say Nepal is the best/most memorable juggling location for me. I went trekking there for a month in 2010 with a couple friends and brought five juggling beanbags along. I pulled them out on occasion and performed at various villages up in the Himalayas -- it was pretty clear that most of the locals had never seen anything like it. One time that sticks out in particular, was when our bus from Kathmandu to Duerali [a village in the mountains] got a flat tire and we had to pull off while they fashioned some sort of janky, quick-fix to keep the bus from falling apart. The bus was packed inside, and there were about twenty people sitting on the roof. While we were waiting, I stepped outside and did an impromptu juggling show. More people crammed on top to watch, and after the bus was fixed, they stayed sitting up there. A few miles down the road, blood started to drip down the front windshield. Which, we later found out was because too many people were on the roof and someone sat on a chicken cage. I still carry a little bit of guilt for my association with that chicken's death. Although, they cooked it up in the next village and all was right again. CNN: Where can people see more of your work? Chris Smith: My juggling persona is That Juggler Guy.

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- An 80-year-old Japanese man on Thursday became the oldest person to reach the top of Mt. Everest, officials said. Yuichiro Miura reached the top of Everest Thursday morning with his physician son Gota, mountaineering official Gyanendra Shrestha said from the base of Everest. Miura's achievement eclipses that of a Nepali man who climbed Everest at age 76 in 2008. The oldest woman to climb Everest is also a Japanese. She was 73 when she reached the top last year. Miura broke his hip in an accident two years ago, and he underwent heart surgery in January. ""I am still healthy and strong. I think I have a good chance to reach the summit of Everest,"" he said via phone earlier this month. To prepare, Miura walked three times a week with loads of 25 to 30 kilograms (55 to 66 lbs) on his back. He reached the top of the 8,848-meter (29,035-foot) peak twice before: in 2003 at age 70, and in 2008 at age 75. ""I have a dream to climb Everest at this age,"" he said. ""If you have a dream, never give up. Dreams come true."" This year marks the 60th anniversary of the first expedition to reach the summit of Everest: Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top of the mountain on May 29, 1953.

"(CNN) -- Having worked in government for more than two decades on the foreign policy side, one of my key takeaways is that the world is a cruel and unforgiving place. And with apologies to Clint Eastwood, more often than not, United States policy options are choices not among the good, bad and the ugly, but just between the last two. The deal to bring Bowe Bergdahl home was one such tortuous choice. Let's be clear: This is a very bad, even ugly deal. The United States undercut almost every principle we claim to adhere to on negotiating with terrorists (in this case, the Haqqani network, the militant group that was holding Bergdahl, has plenty of American blood on its hands) and let out some very bad guys who are almost certain to direct any number of enterprises to attack Americans and weaken the U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. And the administration carried out the Bergdahl deal with its characteristic lack of tactical dexterity and smarts, failing to brief key members of Congress appropriately and perhaps even violating U.S. law. Finally, for all its effort, given the strange and confusing facts surrounding Bergdahl's own actions, the Obama administration is being severely criticized for what it has done. But notwithstanding all that, and however distasteful the deal, it was both a moral and necessary one. And here's why: . Written or unwritten, traditional code or assumed values, in an America-initiated war there are American responsibilities and commitments to those who fight it. We didn't seek out the Afghan campaign. It was a legitimate response to the 9/11 attacks, regardless of how badly managed and unattainable its objectives became over the past decade. And it matters not a whit that we have a volunteer military and that Bergdahl willfully stepped up or that he may have turned against the war or perhaps even deserted his post. These are matters that may or may not be sorted out later. What counts are the responsibilities and obligations the U.S. military and political establishment -- in this case, the commander in chief -- have to those whom they put in harm's way. This relationship between the state and those it marshals and mobilizes to defend the country -- draft or volunteer military -- is a fundamental and contractual obligation. That tradition was established in our own Civil War, in which the magnitude of the death and human misery fundamentally changed the relationship between the federal government and its citizenry. As the extraordinary PBS documentary ""Death and the American Civil War"" makes clear, before 1861, ""there were no national cemeteries in America. No provisions for identifying the dead, or for notifying next of kin, or for providing aid to the suffering families of dead veterans. No federal relief organizations, no effective ambulance corps, no adequate federal hospitals, no federal provisions for burying the dead. No Arlington Cemetery. No Memorial Day."" That war created a new frame of reference for soldier, citizen, and the state: a new set of commitments and undertakings at the national level that have broadened and deepened to this day. That Bergdahl may have violated his part of the contract is dismaying, even perverse, under the circumstances. But it is really not the point. He's one of ours in a war we may not have sought but that our military fought; we made his presence on the field of battle possible and we are responsible for getting him back. Does that mean paying any price and sacrificing countless Americans lives in the process? Of course not. But it does mean undertaking a determined -- even relentless -- effort to look for opportunities and ways to accomplish it consistent with our interests and values. Now for the price that was paid. The details of the urgency, timing and opportunity to trade for Bergdahl are not at all clear. The state of his health, the accuracy of Qatari warnings that his life was in danger, growing frustration on the part of his captors are all missing pieces. And we may never know them fully. The end results are clear though. Did the Haqqani network score a propaganda victory in this trade? Yes, they did. Did the United States weaken its own hand by showing that it will trade kidnapped U.S. soldiers for Afghan prisoners? Sure it did. Is there a risk that those we released will conspire again to kill Americans? You bet there is. But these are contingencies, possibilities in a world of uncertainties that must be measured against the certainty and reality of recovering an American life and redeeming a soldier after five years of captivity. We will never know whether, had the United States not cut this deal, Bergdahl would have been irreparably damaged or killed. Under these circumstances, the decision to redeem Bergdahl was not only compelling, it was a moral imperative. We are not the Israelis. We do not live in an environment of threat and insecurity, one in which our citizens serve in the military and that service is inextricably linked to our culture, values and perception of the world. We do not face existential threats. Nor is our political establishment conditioned to accept asymmetrical trades with terrorists that can reach such proportions as the prisoner deal with Hamas for kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilead Shalit, who was traded for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners. But we claim to be a moral nation with values and principles that coexist alongside our interests. Indeed, many argue that our values are our interests. I cannot think of many foreign policy actions in recent years in which the United States acted principally for moral, ethical or humanitarian considerations. This is one of those rare occasions. And instead of beating ourselves up -- and the President, too -- for acting according to values that we purport to cherish, we need to face up to the fact that we had the conviction and courage to act in a way that was both moral and necessary, however messy the process and the price we may yet pay.","Aaron Miller: U.S. deal to free Bergdahl was ugly, but it was moral and necessary .

"(CNN) -- With more than 1,000 hot springs gurgling beneath 80% of the country, a trip to Hungary isn't complete without one thing: a visit to a spa. The Romans chanced upon Hungary's healing waters more than 2,000 years ago, but the Ottoman Turks really got things going in the 16th century, importing their social spa culture. While the word ""spa"" can conjure images of being pampered in a luxurious setting, in Hungary it's quite different. There's an emphasis on health and well being, so many of the facilities are more functional than plush. A few charge for towels, although the fee can be less than $2. That said, the natural beauty of the country's spas makes up for a certain clinical air. And admission prices, even for a full day, are often less than $15. Bathing and board games . Whereas the French pop into their cafes for a coffee and a chat, Hungarians catch up with the latest gossip while having a soak. They can be seen playing chess in the warm waters of the huge Szechenyi complex in Budapest -- one of the biggest in Europe and one of the most beautiful. They're also taking advantage of the restorative properties in the thermal water. Szechenyi, Allatkerti korut 11, Budapest; +36 1 363 3210 . Salty soaking . One of Hungary's most unusual spas is the open-air complex at Egerszalok, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) east of Budapest . It's obvious why they've nicknamed it Salt Hill: centuries of mineral deposits left by flowing springs have turned the surrounding mounds white. Visitors can take a dip in these hot springs or use the 17 indoor and outdoor pools at the adjoining Saliris Resort. Just five miles away is the incredibly pretty town of Eger, which has a 16th-century Turkish bath and outdoor thermal pools. On offer is the heavy-handed pummeling of the Turkish massage experience, or a chance to relax and gaze at the ornate interior of bright mosaics. The outdoor pools are more boisterous, with plenty of play areas for kids. Egerszalok Spa, Forras ut 4, Egerszalok Hungary +36 36 688 500 .

Another 40 miles (64 kilometers) east past the Bukki National Park is the underground water world at Miskolctapolca. The name doesn't trip off the tongue easily, so many simply call it the Cave Bath. Thermal waters flow through a huge series of limestone caves, all heated at a comfortable 84 F (28.9 C). In summer months, there's an outdoor complex with family pools. Cave Bath, Pazar Istvan setany 1, Miskolctapolca; +36 46 560 030 . Thermal lake . West of Budapest lies the opportunity for a leisurely swim in the largest thermal lake in Europe. Heviz Lake is just beyond the westernmost point of Lake Balaton, about 120 miles (193 kilometers) southwest of Budapest. Hot springs fill this 10-acre lake surrounded by woods and parkland -- these springs work hard enough to change the water every three days. Bathers share the lake with some flora and fauna, namely the resident ducks and water lilies. They must also tolerate the whiff of sulfur that comes from the mineral-rich water. There's a lot going on indoors at the large complex overlooking the lake: seven thermal pools, mud baths and treatments for conditions that can be helped by a therapeutic dip.

A different bathing experience can be found at Europe's largest bath complex at Hajduszoboszlo, 13 miles (21 kilometers) southwest of Debrecen, Hungary's second city. Hungarospa is a giant shrine to water and all the fun that can go with it. It includes Aquapark, where children of all ages -- including babies -- can frolic on water slides and in the bathing pools. Its indoor thermal baths offer treatments for people with various ailments that can be alleviated by water therapy. The Aqua Palace has 20 themed pools recreating everything from a Roman bath to a tropical pool. From May to September, the park's 75 acres become an enormous outdoor water playground. Thirteen pools sprawl around the park, including a mammoth one built to resemble a Mediterranean beach. It's all topped off with an immense pirate ship to keep kids entertained.

Within the 35-acre complex are 32 pools, a sauna big enough for 150 people and plenty of paddling pools for small children. The town is also home Greenfield Golf, Hungary's first 18-hole championship course, so golfers haven't got far to go to soothe tired muscles after a game.

Among the city's charming 19th-century architecture is the neo-Renaissance Anna Thermal Bath. These warm bubbling pools, steam rooms and saunas evoke the charm of Budapest's famous spas such as Szechenyi and Gellert. Across the Szeged Tisza River lies the Napfenyfurdo Aquapolis water park.

"(CNN) -- My participation in the British Invasion came as a total surprise to me. I am indeed British, with an English dad and a Welsh mum. In the mid-1960s, having married a Frenchman, I was living in Paris with two small children and enjoying a highly successful career in Europe, singing in French and other languages. But despite all that, when Tony Hatch, also a Brit, presented me with a song called ""Downtown,"" I knew I wanted to record it. So we went into the studio in London and came out with a hit. It was rapidly picked up by Warner Brothers in the United States, and without any promotion from me, took off to the prized No. 1 spot. And so I was propelled into this amazing and exciting ""love in"" with America. Of course, it changed my life. Suddenly, I was juggling two careers and a family. It was exhilarating, too. I loved performing to American audiences, and I still do. They are the most generous in the world. I was spending more and more time in the States, working with some of the best American musicians and certainly listening to the great American bands of the day: The Beach Boys, The Mamas and the Papas and more. It was wonderful to feel I was in some way part all that was happening at that iconic moment. The spearhead of the ""Invasion"" was of course the Beatles. They opened the floodgates, and the world became aware of British talent almost overnight. Americans seemed to embrace us Brits with something close to a passion. How could we resist? Of course ""Downtown"" was only the beginning. There was ""I Know a Place,"" ""Don't Sleep in the Subway,"" ""Colour My World,"" ""Days"" and more. Tony Hatch went on to write a dozen more hits for me. These songs have survived the '60s, and I still sing them today with much affection. Those days were pretty hectic. I seemed to be constantly bouncing around between the United States and Europe and was jet-lagged most of the time! As for ""the scene"" in the Sixties, I didn't get too involved in it. Of course, there were the inevitable parties and general madness, but I could take it or leave it. I mostly left it. Probably that I was married with a young family kept me on an even keel. For me, the buzz was and still is all about the music and being around people who feel the same way. The British Invasion came and went, but left behind a body of music that lives on today. For those of us who were there, how could we ever forget it?","Petula Clark was living in Paris with her family and had a successful European career .

"(CNN) -- White House officials and some members of Congress reacted strongly Sunday to news that insurance giant AIG had intended to pay out $165 million in bonuses and compensation.  The company has received at least $170 billion in federal bailout money. In a letter to the White House, AIG Chairman Edward Liddy, shown here in December, vows to curb bonuses. Under pressure from the Treasury, AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or ""retention payments"" -- by at least 30 percent. That did little to temper outrage at the initial plan, however. In a letter Sunday to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold urged the Obama administration to explore ""legal options"" to prevent the millions in AIG payouts. ""I write to ask why any bonuses would be legally required, given the company's abysmal performance,"" says Feingold, D-Wisconsin. Feingold asked whether the bonuses could be canceled or recouped from recipients, and whether the administration will sue AIG executives for breaching their duties to shareholders . ""There are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last 18 months, but what's happened at AIG is the most outrageous,"" Lawrence Summers, head of the National Economic Council, told ABC's ""This Week."" ""What that company did, the way it was not regulated, the way no one was watching, what's proved necessary, it is outrageous."" And on ""Fox News Sunday,"" White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was ""really upset by the news."" ""He stepped in and berated them, got them to reduce the bonuses following every legal means he has to do this,"" Goolsbee said. In a letter to Geithner, obtained Saturday by CNN, AIG Chairman and CEO Edward Liddy said his company was taking steps to limit compensation in AIG Financial Products -- the British-based unit responsible for issuing the risky credit default swaps that have brought the company to the brink of collapse. The default swaps amount to insurance against losses from bad loans, which have increased dramatically since the U.S. housing boom peaked. In the letter to Geithner, Liddy said the unit's 25 highest-paid contract employees will reduce their salaries to $1 this year and all other officers in the unit will reduce their salaries by 10 percent. Other ""non-cash compensation"" will be reduced or eliminated. But he told Geithner that some bonus payments are binding legal obligations of the company, and ""there are serious legal, as well as business consequences for not paying."" Rep. Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told Fox that bailout recipients should have to follow stricter compensation rules, and said Congress should look into whether the bonuses are ""legally recoverable."" ""We can't just violate legal obligations, I understand that,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said. ""But I do want to find out at what point these legal obligations were incurred. Who said, and at what point, 'We're going to give these bonuses no matter what?' And I do think it's inappropriate for those people to stay in power at that company."" Frank said that if banks complain that the Obama administration has made things too tough, ""They can give the money back. We made that easy."" Goolsbee said AIG was following ""a policy that's really not sensible, is obviously going to ignite the ire of millions of people."" ""We've done exactly what we can do to prevent this kind of thing from happening again,"" Goolsbee said. Summers told ABC that the administration was taking ""every legal step possible to limit those bonuses."" Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, told ""Fox News Sunday"" he believes it's important to know whether the bonuses are actually commission payments for products sold by brokers, saying he would withhold judgment until that is clarified. However, ""I do think that these entities that are receiving government money, our money, I do think they have to play by a different set of rules,"" Corker said. Hopefully, those different rules will discourage companies from accepting bailout funds, he said. Liddy, however, makes clear in the letter that he took steps to limit his employees' compensation with trepidation. He said the company will have trouble attracting and retaining ""the best and the brightest ... if employees believe that their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury."" AIG lost a record $62 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. It has more than 74 million insurance policies issued in 130 countries around the world. CNN's Elaine Quijano contributed to this report.","Insurance firm's vow to reduce, but not eliminate, some bonuses causes uproar .

"(CNN) -- If there is one man who knows how to spoil a Parisian party then it's Andy Murray. While the majority of the 15,000 crowd packed inside Court Philippe Chatrier roared their home favorite Gael Monfils at every opportunity, their hopes of a French champion were extinguished once again. This was a pulsating clash between two men straining every ounce of energy from their tired bodies and stretching every sinew. Murray, so dominant for so long after taking the opening two sets 6-4 6-1, appeared set to return to his hotel early enough for a night out on the Champs-Élysées. But Monfils, as infuriating as he is talented, did what he does best -- he entertained. The Frenchman, playing to the crowd, took the next two sets 6-4 6-1 before imploding when the tie looked his for the taking. Not since Yannick Noah was crowned champion in 1983 has France witnessed one of its own triumph on the clay. Alas, the wait will now extend into a 32nd year. Murray, who seemed to thrive on the partisan nature of the contest, eased to a 6-4 6-1 lead and seemingly had the match all wrapped up. In 2012, Murray defeated Frenchman Richard Gasquet in a similar setting, and that experience appeared to allow him to settle rather quickly. The World No.8, who was so impressive during his victory over Spain's Fernando Verdasco, looks to be far more comfortable with his game following a troublesome back injury. Against Monfils, a player he often practiced with and competed against as a child, he showed a maturity which the Frenchman sometimes lacks. Nobody can doubt Monfils' ability to entertain but with that comes a constant frustration to combine his style with substance. After conceding the first set, Monfils lost the plot completely in the second before rallying to ensure he at least won a game. The third was more competitive with the home crowd urging the World No.28 to respond and take the contest into a fourth set. And their hero finally responded, converting the third of three set points to take the third 6-4. With the momentum firmly behind him, Monfils broke to take a 4-1 lead in the fourth. Suddenly, playing with the joie de vivre which had been missing earlier in the contest, Monfils appeared unstoppable. He claimed the fourth set 6-1 and appeared set to apply the coup de grâce. But just as the home crowd was about to celebrate a famous victory, Murray wrecked any thoughts of popping Champagne corks. He swept Monfils away with disdain -- 6-0 to secure the match, finish the contest and throw down the gauntlet to his next opponent -- champion Rafael Nadal. Nadal . Can anybody stop Nadal? That's the question Murray will have to answer. David Ferrer, the man vanquished in last year's final by the eight-time French Open champion, was the latest man to feel the wrath of the ""King of Clay"". After a slow start in which he conceded the first set 6-4, Nadal hit back to take the next three sets 6-4 6-0 6-1. The World No.1, who was beaten at Monte Carlo in April by Ferrer, remains a huge favorite to win the title. Petkovic progresses . Andrea Petkovic nearly quit tennis a year ago -- now she stands on the verge of reaching a first grand slam final. The German, who lost in qualifying at Roland Garros 12 months ago, made the last eight at three of the four grand slams in 2011. But her career threatened to derail when she suffered back, knee and ankle injuries and spiraled down the rankings to 177 -- before returning to the tour in March 2013. The 26-year-old, ranked 27, proved too good for Italy's Sara Errani as she carved out a 6-2 6-2 victory. ""Today I was in a real zone,"" she told reporters. ""I stepped up my game when I needed to. That gives me confidence. ""I don't think I'm coming from nowhere to the semifinals. It's a very special moment, I haven't been there before."" Petkovic, who is the first German lady to reach the semifinals since Steffi Graf in 1999, now faces a showdown with Romania's Simona Halep. Halep, the highest seed left in the draw, overcame 2009 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia 6-2 6-2 to claim a place the semifinal of a grand slam for the first time. Halep, ranked fourth in the world, won the junior event on the clay in 2008 and is now hoping to do the double by winning the French Open proper. ""I felt very good on court. It was a perfect day for me. I played really well and stuck to my gameplan,"" she told reporters. ""I was very aggressive. I played very fast. So it was a good match, and I'm really happy that now I can play in the semifinals in Paris.""","Rafael Nadal to face Andy Murray in semifinals .

"(CNN) -- The bitter family dispute over the care of renowned radio announcer Casey Kasem got more bizarre Sunday. Before paramedics wheeled Kasem to an ambulance, his wife, Jean, threw a hunk of meat at one of his daughters who had come to accompany her father to the hospital, officials said Monday. It is the latest incident in the feud between Kerri Kasem and Jean Kasem, who has been married to the former host of ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40"" since 1980, over who should decide his medical care. Casey Kasem has Lewy body disease, the most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's. He is in stable condition at a medical facility in Washington, according to a representative for Kerri Kasem. She claims her father's health has worsened since the last time she saw him weeks ago at a nursing home in Santa Monica, California. She had won a California court order in May to become the temporary conservator for her ailing father, but he went missing for a few days from a nursing home there before being found in Washington state with his wife, Kerri's stepmother. On Friday morning, a Kitsap County, Washington, judge granted Kerri Kasem permission to take her father to a doctor. Kerri Kasem went to the home Sunday, her representative, Danny Deraney, said. She stayed on the street while paramedics went to get the 82-year-old icon, Deraney said. As she waited, Jean Kasem approached and hurled something at Kerri Kasem while referring to King David of the Bible, saying she was throwing the meat at ""the dogs."" A video provided to CNN by Deraney showed part of the incident, and in it, Jean Kasem walks down a driveway, throws underhanded a block of meat, which skips on the pavement toward the person holding the camera. Kerri Kasem said it was a pound of hamburger. A spokesman for the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office said no deputies saw the meat thrown but several witnesses described it. There was no assault complaint, Deputy Scott Wilson said. CNN attempted to contact Jean Kasem's attorney, Craig Marcus, on Monday but didn't get an immediate response. Wilson said the Kasems are due in Kitsap County court again on Friday. Three weeks ago, a California court awarded Kerri Kasem temporary durable power of attorney and health care directive and has ordered Jean Kasem to surrender Casey Kasem's passport to the daughter. The California judge also ordered that Casey Kasem can't travel anywhere without a court order until a doctor clears him. One of Casey Kasem's other daughters, Julie Kasem, and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, have said her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. But Julie and Kerri Kasem and their brother, Mike Kasem, have contended since last year that Jean Kasem has prevented the three siblings from visiting their father. Jean Kasem said in court papers last year that the three children ""single-handedly and irreparably shattered"" the couple's lives by deploying public demonstrations and attacks in the media, according to CNN affiliate KCBS. Kerri Kasem's temporary conservatorship over her father is in effect until June 20, when another California court hearing is scheduled on whether to make the conservatorship permanent.

"Washington (CNN) -- A National Security Agency program for collecting phone and Internet communications of suspected security targets outside the United States has the potential to infringe on the privacy rights of U.S. citizens, according to a report released Wednesday by an independent government review board. The NSA's Section 702 program is still lawful, ""valuable and effective"" in protecting national security, according to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PDF), which noted that ""no evidence of intentional abuse"" was found in the program. However, ""certain aspects of the program's implementation raise privacy concerns,"" according to the report. The large scope of that collection of Americans' information that is supposed to be off-limits -- and uncertainty about the amount of information being gathered -- ""push the program close to the line of constitutional reasonableness."" Despite procedures to minimize collection of domestic and Americans' communications at home and abroad, the government doesn't know precisely how much data and content of Americans' communications is being collected, the report says. The Section 702 program is derived from a section of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that was amended in 2008 and gave the attorney general and the director of national intelligence the authority to authorize ""surveillance conducted within the United States but targeting only non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States."" Even though the 702 program isn't aimed at collecting domestic communications or those of Americans abroad, ""incidental"" collection of such data does occur, according to the report. The board expressed concern over the use of ""about"" collections -- those that lead to a person who may not be involved to a suspect communication -- ""and the use of queries to search for the communications of specific U.S. persons within the information that has been collected."" Among the board's conclusions was an affirmation that the ""core"" of the 702 program -- that is, narrowly defining those subjects targeted as non-U.S. citizens living abroad and submitting to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court rules and oversight -- ""fits within the 'totality of the circumstances' standard for reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, as that standard has been defined by the courts to date."" The report lists 10 recommendations for strengthening privacy protections, such as revising the criteria for selecting targets for intelligence-gathering, limiting FBI use of Section 702 data, using more advanced ""upstream"" filtering technology to protect communications that are off-limits and requiring the government to supply random samples of targeting decisions to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court when reapplying for certification of the Section 702 program. The nation's top intelligence official praised the report, but civil liberty advocates said the board failed to make effective proposals to protect privacy rights. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement that the report ""confirms that Section 702 has shown its value in preventing acts of terrorism at home and abroad, and pursuing other foreign intelligence goals."" ""We take very seriously the board's concerns regarding privacy and civil liberties, and we will review the board's recommendations with care."" Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law said the board ""has failed to fulfill its responsibility here, which is to ensure that counterterrorism policies safeguard privacy and civil liberties."" ""The collection of Americans' phone calls and e-mails without a warrant is unconstitutional,"" Goitein said, ""regardless of whether they are communicating with their next-door neighbor or a suspected terrorist overseas."" ""The Board made a critical point that has often been overlooked in the NSA debate: that privacy is a human right protected under international law,"" said Faiza Patel, also with the Brennan Center. She added that the issue ""is much larger than simply the implementation of the directive and the Board should take it on directly and expeditiously."" ""We urge Congress to recognize the gaps and shortcomings in the Board's recommendations,"" Patel said, ""and provide a more meaningful level of privacy protection for Americans and foreigners alike."" The independent panel began reviewing NSA surveillance at the requests of Congress and President Barack Obama last year. The requests stemmed from media reports on two NSA programs that were based on the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The first report, released in January, centered on the program implemented under Section 215 of the Patriot Act (PDF), in which domestic telephone metadata (i.e., call records) are collected in bulk.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- The Los Angeles Times' headquarters aptly sits where the U.S. Army corralled camels during the Civil War, when Southern California was a desert with no natural resources. A new film on PBS explores how the Chandler family helped develop Los Angeles through their newspaper. Los Angeles' development from an arid wasteland to a world metropolis and cultural capital is closely linked to the newspaper's rise under the ownership of one family. ""It would still be a desert,"" documentary filmmaker Peter Jones said, if Gen. Harrison Gray Otis didn't arrive in the 1880s to take over the bankrupt Los Angeles Times and his son-in-law, Harry Chandler, wasn't there to follow him. Jones' documentary is a saga of four generations of the region's most powerful family shaping Los Angeles as they pursued their own civil agendas -- and accumulated wealth. ""Inventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times"" premieres Monday on PBS. Historian David Halberstam said in the documentary that the Chandlers dominated Southern California as no other family has dominated any major region of the United States. ""They did not so much foster the growth of Los Angeles as invent it,"" said Halberstam, who died in 2007. Harrison Gray Otis, Harry Chandler, Norman Chandler and Otis Chandler succeeded each other at the helm of the Los Angeles Times over a span of 100 years. The city grew from a small desert town to the nation's second-largest city, while the family became one of the nation's wealthiest. The Chandler family dynasty ended when the general's great-grandson Otis Chandler was ousted as chairman of the Times board of directors in 1985. The family eventually sold its Times-Mirror Company to Chicago's Tribune Company -- which is now in bankruptcy. Each man's personality and strengths were tailored for what was demanded of their time, said Jones. ""For each era, they were up to that particular era,"" he said. ""You couldn't actually rearrange them,"" said Harry Chandler's namesake and the great-great-grandson of the general. ""You couldn't have a General Otis in late 20th-century America,"" Chandler told CNN, referring to the dynasty's founder who served as an Army general in the Philippine-American War before taking over the Los Angeles Times. ""His character was one of the period. 'I have a vision and everything I touch needs to support that vision and damn the consequences.'"" Otis used his newspaper to scare the public about the threat of drought, drumming up support for a 230-mile aqueduct -- one of the modern engineering marvels -- to divert water from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles, Jones said. He was part of a syndicate that bought vast tracts of barren land in the San Fernando Valley with the inside knowledge the Los Angeles Aqueduct would bring water there. The scandal later inspired Roman Polanski's award-winning film ""Chinatown."" Otis also used the Times to influence the federal government's decision to build the Port of Los Angeles, Jones said. ""He had the foresight to say 'We have to build a man-made harbor here in Los Angeles if we want to become a major port of trade,' and today the Port of Los Angeles is the busiest port in the United States,"" Jones said. The general and his successor son-in-law promoted investment in and migration to the Los Angeles area with stories of sunshine and opportunity. More people moving in meant more readers for their newspaper and demand for the real estate empire they were building. Harrison Gray Otis and Harry Chandler used their newspaper to create a vision of Los Angeles as ""America's Great White Spot"" -- free of crime and communism. They fought a decades-long battle against labor unions -- a battle that included the 1910 bombing of The Los Angeles Times headquarters. The Los Angeles film, aviation, high technology, shipping and oil industries grew from the Chandlers' influence, Jones said. As a conservative Republican family, they helped launch Richard Nixon's political career in post-World War II California. The story is not all about the men. Dorothy Chandler -- the strong-willed wife of Norman Chandler -- waged a relentless campaign to turn Los Angeles into a world-class cultural center, Jones said. She led a campaign to raise money to save the Hollywood Bowl and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In doing so, she brought together the Westside Jewish community with the white Protestant establishment based in Pasadena, Harry Chandler said. Tom Johnson, who became first nonfamily publisher of the Times in 1980, said one of Dorothy Chandler's ""most remarkable"" contributions was the successful effort to make sure her son Otis succeeded her husband as publisher in 1960. ""The very new approach that Otis took and his leadership of the newspaper was just astounding,"" Johnson said in an interview with CNN. Otis Chandler gave reporters editorial independence, opened news bureaus around the world and strengthened the paper's coverage of the suburbs, Johnson said. Under Otis Chandler, it rose from being one of the worst major papers in the country to being one of the top three, Johnson said. ""It was his goal to make the Los Angeles Times one of the best newspapers, and he did it in 20 years, being the right publisher at the right time,"" Johnson said. But Otis Chandler's transformation of the Times from a conservative newspaper into a Pulitzer Prize-winning rival to the New York Times and Washington Post angered many Chandler family members. ""Some Chandlers were members of the John Birch society; his paper did an expose on it,"" Johnson said. Otis Chandler's newspaper looked closely at the Los Angeles Police Department, ""which had a reputation to shoot first and ask questions,"" Johnson said. The deep family rift eventually led to the sale of the Times-Mirror Company to the Tribune Company -- and the end of the dynasty. Johnson, who left the newspaper in 1989 and later became chairman of CNN, said the paper declined in the years since because ""rather than going for people who were superb newspaper people, they went outside to pick people who, in my opinion, blew the place apart."" Some Chandler family descendants cooperated with Jones' efforts to explore the Chandler family's dealings. ""He doesn't whitewash, but he doesn't dig into the dark side and linger too long,"" said Harry Chandler, the son of Otis Chandler. The documentary is ""on whole, a very balanced, very accomplished, incredibly well researched"" documentary, Chandler said. Jones said he avoided judging the motives of Gen. Otis and his successors. ""When these guys were going about building the city, sometimes they did things, I wouldn't say in an underhanded way, but in a very private way,"" Jones said. ""How do you ascribe motives to people who did things 100 years ago? Was it for greed, avarice and duplicity? History in general is this tangled web of good and evil.""","""Inventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times"" premieres Monday on PBS .

"(CNN) -- The head of an al Qaeda-inspired militia fighting in Syria is giving a radical splinter group five days to end infighting and accept arbitration from Sunni clerics or face expulsion from the region, according to an audio message posted online Tuesday. Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the chief of al-Nusra Front, called on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to stop turning its guns on its allies and return to the fold of al Qaeda's central command. ""I swear by God, if you again refuse God's judgment, and do not stop your plague and pushing your ignorant ideology on the Muslim nation then you will be expelled, even from Iraq,"" al-Jolani said in the more than eight-minute message produced by al-Nusra Front's media wing al-Manara al-Baydha. Earlier this month, even top al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri weighed in on the situation, and the group's central leadership posted a notice online saying ISIS ""is not a branch of the al Qaeda group."" The al-Nusra Front and ISIS are both fighting in Syria. Al-Nusra and other Islamist insurgents argue that the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad's government is the top priority, but ISIS wants the formation of a radical Islamist state to be the main goal. Apparently, ISIS also has been fighting against al-Nusra members and against civilians who support the opposition. A conflict in Islamic jurisprudence appears at the core of the long-standing dispute between the Iraqi-born extremist group and its former comrades in al Qaeda. ""Know that we have patiently waited for a whole year while you committed violations, made false accusations, and misconstrued the truth to justify your greater corruption. We relinquished many of our rights,"" al-Jolani said in the audio message. ""You know that until now we have not turned away from the frontlines or fighting the regime as you have done."" The order comes just two days after a suicide bombing allegedly carried out by ISIS killed a mediator representing al-Zawahiri in northern Syria. Abu Khaled al-Souri's assassination dashed hopes for a political resolution to months of open warfare between ISIS and rebel factions that has claimed the lives of at least 2,000 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and culminated in the expulsion of the renegade group from al Qaeda's general command earlier this month. ""Al-Zawahiri is clearly fed up with ISIS's open rejection of his overall leadership of the al Qaeda network. Moreover, he is likely quite concerned about how ISIS is alienating ordinary Syrians by a brutal campaign that has involved the public beheading of opponents and the imposition of Taliban-style rule on the population, including the banning of smoking, music and unveiled women in public,"" Peter Bergen, a national security analyst for CNN, wrote earlier this month. The bad blood between the two groups started last April when ISIS Chief Abu Bakr al Baghdadi announced his group's expansion into Syria and claimed to absorb al-Nusra Front into his ranks. Tensions rose after al Baghdadi openly refused to heed al-Zawahiri's directive to disband and leave Syria. Analysts say the factional fighting strengthens the government's hand in the country's nearly three-year civil war by distracting insurgents from engaging in combat with Syrian troops and diverting resources and manpower to the war within a war.","Radical Islamist group in Syria is warned to accept arbitration or leave country .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius needs to undergo mental health examinations, the judge in his murder trial ruled Wednesday, putting a halt to the proceedings after nearly two months of testimony. The very unusual move throws the trial into confusion. How long's the trial delayed? We don't know yet. Judge Thokozile Masipa will formally issue her ruling on Tuesday. By that time, she should know who will do the evaluation of Pistorius and when and where it will take place. At that point, it should be somewhat clearer when the trial will resume -- if it does at all. How long will the evaluations take? A minimum of 30 days. Will Pistorius have to live in an institution? Judge Masipa hopes he will not. She said she did not intend to ""punish the accused twice"" by putting him in a situation where he had to be locked up, and asked if he could be evaluated as an outpatient. Pistorius should learn the answer on Tuesday. Neither side believes he's mentally ill, so what's this all about? The defense team put a psychiatrist, Dr. Merryll Vorster, on the stand to testify that Pistorius suffers from ""generalized anxiety disorder."" The disorder means he has ""excessive"" concerns about security, and that he felt threatened even when, objectively, he was not, she testified. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel seized on the psychiatrist's testimony, arguing that if the defendant's mental health is even potentially an issue in the trial, he needed to be referred for expert evaluation. The defense is not arguing that mental illness played a role in Pistorius shooting and killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, so they opposed the motion. But after considering the question overnight, Masipa granted the prosecution request. Was Nel's push for tests a total surprise? What's his strategy? Yes. It's incredibly unusual for the prosecution -- rather than the defense -- to argue that a defendant might have defense of insanity. Nel seems to be placing a high-stakes bet that experts will disagree with the evidence of Dr. Vorster. How will finding on mental state affect the trial? The expert panel evaluating Pistorius has three options. They could find that Pistorius was mentally incapacitated when he shot Steenkamp, which would end the trial immediately in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness. That would lead to the athlete being committed to a mental institution until he is ruled not to be a danger. The doctors could also find that he had ""diminished responsibility"" at the time he killed Steenkamp. In that case, the trial would resume, and the experts' finding would be taken into consideration during sentencing if he is found guilty. The third possibility is that the experts could disagree with the defense psychiatrist and say that Pistorius' mental health is not an issue at all. If that happens, Vorster's testimony could be disregarded. The experts might not all agree with each other, and lawyers on either side could disagree with the experts' report, leading to any number of possible outcomes. If there is any dispute, the final decision about what to do with the experts' report lies with the judge. Is this good or bad for Pistorius? It all depends on what the mental health experts decide. If they agree with Vorster or find he was incapacitated, that will help Pistorius. In one respect, though, the ruling is not to his advantage: It pushes off the end of his trial, leaving him in legal limbo at least another few months.","A surprise order for mental testing for Oscar Pistorius raises questions for his trial .
Testing will last at least 30 days, pushing off the end of the trial .
A prosecution move for mental observation is very unusual .

"(CNN) -- High-stakes lawsuits, overlapping investigations and a bitter battle over blame are spreading across Europe in the wake of a scandal that has rocked the meat industry. Horse meat was discovered in products that are supposed to be 100% beef, sold in Sweden, the United Kingdom and France. On Sunday, a major company under scrutiny called one of its suppliers a ""villain"" responsible for the fraud. The supplier, in turn, insisted it was ""fooled"" by a subsupplier. While authorities say there is no immediate cause for health concerns, the discovery was a new shock to an industry already reeling from a bombshell last month when Irish investigators found horse and pig DNA in numerous hamburger products. The blame chain . Swedish food producer Findus has been a focus of the uproar since it announced Thursday that it had withdrawn its lasagna from stores as a precaution. The products were pulled Monday after French supplier Comigel raised concerns about the type of meat that was used, Findus Sweden said. Findus said a letter from Comigel dated February 2 informed Findus that the contamination may date back to August 2012. Horsemeat found in hamburgers in Britain and Ireland . Findus is only one of several companies that receive products from Comigel. Others include Axfood, Coop and ICA, which have recalled some meat products in Sweden, and Aldi, which has pulled some products from shelves in Britain. Six big French retailers -- Auchan, Casino, Carrefour, Cora, Picard and Monoprix -- said Sunday that they were recalling lasagne and other products. Findus Nordic, which oversees Findus throughout the Nordic region, said it has begun legal action against Comigel and its subsuppliers. ""We are only at the beginning of our legal process. Comigel will end up in a lot of legal processes going forward, I imagine,"" Findus Nordic CEO Jari Latvanen said Sunday in an interview with CNN. ""Comigel is the villain."" Comigel has not responded to CNN's requests for comment. The company did not answer its phones when CNN called repeatedly, and did not respond to an e-mail request for comment. Neither did CEO Erick Lehagre. But Lehagre told French news agency Agence France-Presse on Sunday that his company had been ""fooled"" by a French supplier. ""We were victims,"" he said, according to AFP. Comigel apparently took its website down, posting a sign that it is ""under construction."" Previously, the site described the company as offering a wide array of products through partners, including major European retailers. Criss-crossing investigations . Probes are under way in France, Sweden, and Britain. The supply chain being studied includes still more countries. France's consumer affairs minister, Benoit Hamon, ordered an immediate investigation and said results will be available by midweek. In a statement, Hamon said a provider in Luxembourg and traders in Cyprus and the Netherlands are part of the chain being probed. The Swedish National Food Agency announced Sunday that it is reporting Findus to police, which is the standard course of action when products have been sold with the wrong labels. British police are investigating as well. British officials held an emergency meeting Saturday in London. Participants agreed ""meaningful results"" must be achieved by Friday, UK Food Standards Agency spokesman Brad Smythe said. Officials discussed what tests are possible, what laboratory capacity is needed, and what can be done to protect consumer confidence, he said. The evidence so far suggests ""either criminal activity or gross negligence,"" Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said, adding that ""more bad news"" could come. UK food businesses have been ordered to test all processed beef products for authenticity and report back to the authorities by Friday. ""I am determined that we get to the bottom of this and that any wrongdoing discovered is punished,"" Paterson said in a statement. Prime Minister David Cameron weighed in Friday on Twitter. ""This is completely unacceptable -- this isn't about food safety but about proper food labeling and confidence in retailers,"" he wrote. Legal action under way . Latvanen credits his company with uncovering ""a serious case of fraud."" ""What has happened with Comigel is a crime, a scandal,"" he said in an interview with CNN. Burger King finds horse meat at European supplier . While Findus has begun legal action in Sweden, Findus France previously said it will file a legal complaint Monday against a Romanian business that is part of the supply chain. It did not name the business publicly. ""There are two victims in this affair: Findus and the consumer,"" Findus France said in a statement. The British arm of Findus said it is considering legal action against suppliers as well. Early results of an internal investigation ""strongly suggest"" the horse meat contamination of a beef lasagna product ""was not accidental,"" the company said. Tests showed up to 100% horse meat . Aldi said tests on random samples demonstrated that the withdrawn products contained between 30% and 100% horse meat. ""This is completely unacceptable and like other affected companies, we feel angry and let down by our supplier. If the label says beef, our customers expect it to be beef."" Samples of the affected Findus lasagna contained between 60% and 100% horse meat, according to UK and Irish food safety inspectors. In January, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland found that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study contained horse DNA, while 23 of them -- or 85% -- tested positive for pig DNA. In nine out of the 10 burger samples, the horse DNA was found at very low levels, the inspectors said. But in one sample from Tesco, Britain's largest retailer, the horse meat accounted for about 29% of the burger. Tesco apologized and vowed to make sure it never happens again. Irish officials blamed ingredients from Poland. Concerns about a veterinary drug . While horse meat is not itself a food safety hazard, food inspectors are concerned it may contain the veterinary drug phenylbutazone, or ""bute,"" commonly used to treat horses. Meat from animals treated with phenylbutazone may pose a risk to human health and is not allowed to enter the food chain as it may pose a risk to human health. Findus has been ordered to test the lasagna withdrawn from shelves in the United Kingdom for the drug's presence. The revelations have revolted many meat eaters in the United Kingdom, where horse meat is generally considered taboo, although it is commonly eaten in neighboring France, as well as countries including China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Italy. The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products. Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horse meat. The UK Justice Ministry confirmed last week that a number of meat pies and similar items supplied to prisons in England and Wales were labeled and served as halal -- prepared in compliance with Islamic dietary law -- but contained traces of pork DNA, the Food Standards Agency said. Horse meat is not commonly eaten in the United States, but the country does export it to Canada and Mexico. Congress passed a bill in November 2011 that lifted a 5-year-old ban on the slaughter of horses for meat in the United States. Horse: Coming soon to a meat case near you?

"Wimbledon, London (CNN) -- If Novak Djokovic wants to win a second Wimbledon title, he'll have to perform better in the final against Roger Federer than in his semifinal Friday. He admitted as much. While seven-time champion Federer eased past big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic 6-4 6-4 6-4, top-seed Djokovic struggled to overcome much-hyped Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 3-6 7-6 7-6 in a nonetheless highly memorable encounter. Not for the quality of tennis, mind you, but for the momentum shifts, some of the unforced errors and the number of slips. On one occasion, Dimitrov and Djokovic took a tumble at almost the same time and faced each other close to the net, much to the crowd's delight. For the combatants, the court must have felt like a skating rink. Maybe playing in front of Maria Sharapova -- Dimitrov's girlfriend -- was just too much for the duo. Sharapova is also friends with Djokovic, though her loyalties weren't divided on Center Court. ""At a certain stage of the match I was frustrated because I again allowed my opponent to come back to the match,"" Djokovic, referring to his quarterfinal against Marin Cilic, told reporters. ""That's something that I definitely cannot allow myself in the finals against Roger."" The conditions weren't easy. It was windy and hot. But Djokovic was in control, leading by a set and break, and he led by a break in the fourth set before needing to rally from 6-3 down in the tiebreak. Indeed, when it looked like Dimitrov would force a fifth set, the match resembled last year's Wimbledon semifinal between Djokovic and Juan Martin del Potro. Djokovic also held the advantage in the fourth set then but lost it and was forced into a fifth, which no doubt affected his display in the finale against Andy Murray. The silky smooth Federer had no such problems with his footing, his court positioning further up than Djokovic and Dimitrov. Raonic and Dimitrov, part of the younger guard, played in their first grand slam semifinals. Djokovic hired Boris Becker in the off-season -- the German was one of the best volleyers of his generation -- but the Serb only won 57% of net points Friday. On a first match point in the fourth-set tiebreak, he failed to put away two volleys, temporarily keeping Dimitrov in the affair. Becker declined an interview request from CNN after the match. Djokovic put in a worrying display (for his fans at least) Wednesday too, taken to five sets by Cilic. He won the first set against Cilic and had a 9-0 record against the Croatian prior to Wimbledon. If this was 2011, when Djokovic won three majors, he'd have coasted. ""When Novak is at his best, you think, 'How can anyone beat him?"" asked Wally Masur, an Australian tennis analyst who won three titles during his playing days. ""But hanging on to his best for long periods of time is something that has really kind of eluded him since he had that brilliant year. ""I don't know why that is. He smoked Cilic in the first set and the next thing you know they're in a dogfight."" And had it not been for a lucky Djokovic shot in the third set, Dimitrov might have advanced to a maiden grand slam final. Staring at a break point at 3-3, Djokovic didn't hit his backhand down the line cleanly, but it went over the net and gave the speedy Dimitrov no chance. Dimitrov then imploded in the third-set tiebreak. What significantly helped Djokovic was hitting 17 aces. Dimitrov's serve, meanwhile, let him down. At 6-6 in the fourth-set tiebreak, he gifted Djokovic a double fault for a second match point. Federer, who improved to 9-0 in Wimbledon semifinals, handled Raonic in as routine a fashion as the score suggested. He broke once in each set and wasn't broken himself. Federer leads Djokovic 18-16 head-to-head -- including 2-1 this year -- but the last time they squared off in a grand slam final was at the 2007 US Open. ""We've played a lot actually in the last six months,"" Federer, bidding for a record-extending 18th men's major, told the BBC. ""It's gone back and forth. He's a great champion and has been around now for a long time, so he's used to these occasions. I hope it's going to be a good match."" An even more relevant statistic? Djokovic is 0-5 in his last five grand slam finals outside Australia. ""I don't want to sound like I'm not appreciating to play finals of a grand slam,"" said Djokovic. ""It's already a huge result. We cannot take that for granted. But I know that I can win the title. ""I should have won a few matches that I lost in the finals of grand slams in the last couple of years. It's a learning process. ""It's understanding, identifying where the problem is, pushing for it, working on it. It's mental in the end of the day."" Masur didn't think Djokovic's laborious semifinal outing would necessarily carry over to Sunday. ""It's very hard to transfer what's occurred today and take it into another match because I really think the conditions were a factor,"" Masur told CNN. Djokovic hopes he's right.","Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer reach Wimbledon final .
