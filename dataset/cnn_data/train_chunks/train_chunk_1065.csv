"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Tuesday criticized President Barack Obama's initial handling of the Ebola crisis as 'incompetent,' saying it gave rise to unneeded fears among the American public about the virus. Bush, who is the latest potential Republican presidential candidate to attack the president over Ebola, also said in a wide-ranging discussion at Vanderbilt University that he supports travel restrictions for people who have been to the most severely affected countries in Africa. Bush said Obama should have been more 'clear and concise' about his plans, and lent more credibility to health officials leading the response. Jeb Bush spoke at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Monday. He slammed Barack Obama's handling of Ebola a day later, in what sounded like a campaign message trial balloon . GUV TO GUV: Bush seemed to support fellow Republican Chris Christie (left), the New Jersey governor who instituted an Ebola quarantine policy beyond what Obama's CDC said was prudent . 'It looked very incompetent to begin with, and that fueled fears that may not be justified,' Bush said. 'And now you have states that are legitimately acting on their concerns, creating a lot more confusion than is necessary.' Obama has tried to place his own imprint on the government's response, making sure photographers captured images of him meeting with the Ebola team and embracing Nina Pham, one of the Dallas nurses who recovered after contracting the disease. On Tuesday he called U.S. workers in West Africa and delivered a statement from the South Lawn before leaving on a campaign trip to Wisconsin. Bush contrasted what he characterized as the president's indecisive approach on Ebola to his own actions as governor when anthrax was mailed to a supermarket tabloid in Florida after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. 'We gave people a sense of calm, what the plan was,' Bush said. 'We talked in plainspoken English. We were totally engaged.' Bush also criticized Obama's foreign policy as lacking clear 'guiding principles,' which he said has created a power vacuum that has been filled by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Time for choosing? Fifty years after an history Ronald Reagan speech kicked off the modern conservative movement, Jeb Bush inched closer to a presidential run . 'It's been an unmitigated disaster in that regard,' Bush said. 'And he now is paying the price.' Bush concluded the talk by saying that he would wait until the end of the year before consulting with his family about whether to make a run for president. 'If it's a yes, I guess you go in the Batcave,' he said. 'You try to acquire some superhuman skills, which I definitely will need, because I'm imperfect in every way.' But Bush said he wasn't overly consumed by the heavy speculation about whether he would seek to follow his father and brother to the White House. 'I'm totally blessed,' he said. 'So I'm not like really freaking out about this decision.'","Former Florida governor is rumored to be a 2016 presidential contender and the THIRD Bush to take the presidential plunge .

"In the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations, a San Franciso privay group has revealed that all of the major messaging apps have fundamental flaws. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) released its Secure Messaging Scorecard today, evaluating dozens of messaging technologies on a range of security best practices. The scorecard includes more than three dozen tools, including chat clients, text messaging apps, email applications, and technologies for voice and video calls - and found all of the major players were left wanting. Scroll down for video . The big players: EFF examined them on seven factors, like whether the message is encrypted both in-transit and at the provider level, and if the code is audited and open to independent review. not of the big players, all shown here, scored aperfectly. The EFF looked at the following when assessing the security of various tools: . 1. Is your communication encrypted in transit? 2. Is your communication encrypted with a key the provider doesn't have access to? 3. Can you independently verify your correspondent's identity? 4. Are past communications secure if your keys are stolen? 5. Is the code open to independent review? 6. Is the crypto design well-documented? 7. Has there been an independent security audit? 'The revelations from Edward Snowden confirm that governments are spying on our digital lives, devouring all communications that aren't protected by encryption,' said EFF Technology Projects Director Peter Eckersley. 'Many new tools claim to protect you, but don't include critical features like end-to-end encryption or secure deletion. 'This scorecard gives you the facts you need to choose the right technology to send your message.' The scorecard includes more than three dozen tools, including chat clients, text messaging apps, email applications, and technologies for voice and video calls. EFF examined them on seven factors, like whether the message is encrypted both in-transit and at the provider level, and if the code is audited and open to independent review. Six of these tools scored all seven stars, including ChatSecure, CryptoCat, Signal/Redphone, Silent Phone, Silent Text, and TextSecure. Apple's iMessage and FaceTime products stood out as the best of the mass-market options, although neither currently provides complete protection against sophisticated, targeted forms of surveillance. The tool was launched in the wake of revelations from Edward Snowden . Many options—including Google, Facebook, and Apple's email products, Yahoo's web and mobile chat, Secret, and WhatsApp—lack the end-to-end encryption that is necessary to protect against disclosure by the service provider. Several major messaging platforms, like QQ, Mxit, and the desktop version of Yahoo Messenger, have no encryption at all. Both WhatsApp and Facebook messenger scored poorly in the tests . 'We're focused on improving the tools that everyday users need to communicate with friends, family members, and colleagues,' said EFF Staff Attorney Nate Cardozo. 'We hope the Secure Messaging Scorecard will start a race-to-the-top, spurring innovation in stronger and more usable cryptography.'","Electronic Frontier Foundation created scorecard for messaging systems .

"Eight schools across three New England states have been forced to evacuate students after receiving bomb threats in just the past four days. It all began Wednesday morning, when a bomb threat led to the evacuation of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Monroe, Connecticut. That same day, Ross A. Lurgio Middle School and Bedford High School in Bedford, New Hampshire and Bedford High School in Bedford, Massacusetts were all evacuated for the same reason. Then, this morning, Westwood High School, Thurston Middle School, and Xaverian Brothers High School, in Westwood, Massachusetts received threats as well. Scroll down for video . Number 2: Sandy hook Elementary had a bomb threat called in Wednesday morning . First: Franklin High School in Franklin, Massachusetts had a bomb threat emailed in Tuesday morning . Authorities are still uncertain if these threats are connected or just some awful coincidence. A bomb threat was also emailed to Franklin High School in Franklin, Massachusetts on Tuesday morning, again forcing an evacuation, but principal Peter Light quickly realized it was a hoax after searching the school. At Sandy Hook,  Monroe Police Lt. Brian McCauley says the threat was called in to the school at 9:30 a.m. and the evacuation was ordered as a precaution. He says the school building and grounds were checked and no evidence of danger was found. The former Chalk Hill Middle School in Monroe, Connecticut was repurposed for use by Sandy Hook students after their school in Newtown became the backdrop for America's most horrific school shooting to date in 2012. Number three: Bedford High School in Bedford, Massachusetts received a bomb threat via email . Number four: Another Bedford High School, this one in new Hampshire, received a threat that day as well . Number five: Ross A. Lurgio Middle School in Bedford, New Hampshire was also evacuated . That same day in Bedford, New Hampshire, Principal William Hagen received a bomb threat via email, and cancelled classes at the high school as well as Ross A. Lurgio Middle School. It contained some details in it that gave us pause,' McGee said, including the time that the threat would be carried out, which McGee said was in the afternoon according to the New Hampshire Union Leader. After an intense search, authorities determined there was no evidence a bomb had been planted. The fourth school to receive a threat that day was also in Bedford, but this time Bedford, Massachusetts, as Bedford High School was evacuated after, again, an email threat. And, again, authorities found no reason to believe there was a bomb. Number six: Students at Thurston Middle School in Westwood, Massachusetts, were told to shelter in place after a threat this morning . Number seven: Nearby Westwood High School was evacuated . Number eight: The most recent to receive a threat is Xaverian Brothers High School, also in Westwood . Now this morning three more schools, Westwood High School, Thurston Middle School, and Xaverian Brothers High School, all in Westwood, Massachusetts, received threats, though students at Thurston were not evacuated and instead told to shelter in place. Once again, the threat came over email. Public safety officials determined the threat to be unsubstantiated, Westwood High School Principal Sean Bevan told WCVB. After the incidents that happened on Wednesday, the FBI announced it would be investigationg further into the threats in both Bedford towns. It seems likely that investigation will also include Westwood now. There have been no arrests made in any of the cases.","Eight schools in three New England states have received bomb threats over just the past four days .

A small group of volunteers spotted that the Victorian villa, formerly owned by Manchester University, had fallen into serious disrepair in the 1990s and formed a group to save it . The battle to rescue the house on Plymouth Grove from decay and demolition has taken a small band of volunteers more than 20 years. They spotted that the Victorian villa, formerly owned by Manchester University, had fallen into serious disrepair in the 1990s and formed a group to save it. More than £3.5million later, the house has had its roof completely replaced, been replastered on the outside and completely restored inside. Volunteers worked with John Rylands Library to examine Gaskell's letters and books, carpets and furnishings have been especially made to resemble those she described.

The Grade II house, owned by Manchester Historic Buildings Trust who battled to save it, will now host a book club and literary events, as well as being open to visitors on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. A scene from a BBC adaptation of North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell . Novelist and short story writer Elizabeth Gaskell, often referred to as just Mrs Gaskell, was born Elizabeth Stevenson on September 29, 1810. Her novels offered portraits of the lives of people in the Victorian era - including the very poor - and was the first to write a biography of Charlotte Bronte. She married Unitarian minister William Gaskell in 1832 and the pair later settled in Manchester. The industrial surroundings of the city influenced the writer's work. But it was the death of her son William in 1845 which proved the catalyst for her first novel, Mary Barton. The couple went on to have four more children, Marianne, Margaret Emily, known as Meta, Florence Elizabeth, and Julia Bradford. They moved to their third home was a large house near open fields in Plymouth Grove. The family entertained a stream of visitors, including a number of eminent figures. Her connections included such the Wedgwoods, the Darwins and the Nightingales. Charles Dickens and John Ruskin visited Plymouth Grove, as did the American writers Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles Eliot Norton, while the conductor Charles Hallé, who lived close by, taught piano to one of their daughters. Her close friend Charlotte Brontë stayed there three times. Built between 1835-1841, Gaskell House is seen as rare example of the elegant Regency-style villas once popular in the city. It was here that she would go on to write some of her most famous works, including Cranford and North and South. Her other works included Lizzie Leigh, Lady Ludlow, and her last novel Wives and Daughters. Elizabeth Gaskell died of a heart attack in 1865, while visiting a house she had purchased in Holybourne, Hampshire. Janet Allan, 79, chair of the Trust who has led efforts to save the house, said: 'This is a triumph - we have been very fortunate to work with skilled professionals but also volunteers without whom we could not have done this. 'I should love to know what Elizabeth Gaskell would think of the house now. Some places have an atmosphere all of their very own and this is one of them. 'Elizabeth Gaskell said she wanted the house to give as much pleasure to others as it did her and that is our motto.' Descendants of Elizabeth Gaskell returned to the house where she lived to see its transformation. Visitors can now see digitised copies of Gaskell's early drafts, letters and manuscripts, along with exhibitions on the history of the area .

"A pair of amorous tram riders in Melbourne have been caught engaging in sex acts during a commute. The couple were reportedly spotted  engaging in the inappropriate behaviour on the number 55 service, said The Courier Mail. The pair boarded the tram line, which runs from Colburg to Domain, at Flagstaff Hill Station, and quickly proceeded to start performing the intimate acts on each other. A pair of amorous tram riders in Melbourne have been caught engaging in sex acts during a commute. Passengers on the tram have been reported as seeming uncomfortable, and while no official action has been taken, a spokesperson for Yarra Trams has said that the company was checking whether a formal complaint had been lodged. Commuters on Melbourne public transport may not be unfamiliar with this type of incident, after reports surfaced of an amateur pornography film being taped on an inner city train. The film was uploaded to a popular internet site, and had attracted more than 200,000 views before police took action against the couple and the production company. In the footage, a man and a woman are clearly shown engaging in sex acts in broad daylight on a train carriage travelling along the Epping route, before making their exodus at Reservoir train station. The couple faced fines of $563 each for behaving in an insulting or offensive manner, an indication of the penalty that could face the couple in the most recent incident. Sergeant Kris Hamilton spoke on behalf of Victoria police, and said the pair should be ashamed of themselves, reported The Herald Sun. 'It is offensive and inappropriate and people caught will be dealt with by police by either copping a fine or being arrested,' he said. 'I use public transport daily and I’m sure I speak on behalf of other commuters when I say this is not what you want to be subjected to en-route home after a tough day in the office.'","Spotted engaging in inappropriate behaviour on the number 55 service .

"Four young children were today being cared for by friends after their father was arrested on suspicion of stabbing their mother to death. The woman, named locally as Raheela Imran, 41, was pronounced dead by paramedics at her large, end-of-terrace home at 4.50pm yesterday. Thames Valley Police were called and a man, named locally as the victim’s husband Imran Sharif, who celebrated his 44th birthday last Monday was arrested on suspicion of murder today. A body believed to be that of Raheela Imran, 41, is removed from her home in Slough.  A man aged 44, named locally as her husband Imran Sharif has been arrested on suspicion of murder . The semi-detached property where the family lived in Slough, Berks, was cordoned off with police standing guard as forensic investigators searched the red brick home for clues. The next door house, which was owned by the couple but rented out to tenants, was also cordoned off. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: “They had three daughters and a son, the youngest was about four and the eldest 13 or 14.

Forensic technologists leave the semi-detached house where Mrs Imran lived . “They were great people, it is really shocking. I didn’t sleep the whole night as a lot was going on. “There were 15 police cars and vans down here from about 5pm.” Another neighbour said the couple, who were originally from Pakistan, had lived at the house for 12 years and Mrs Imran worked part-time at Curry’s electrical store in Bath Road, Slough. A resident of neighbouring Bell Close said: “I walk my dog around past the house and the kids were always outside playing, there were always lots of people running in and out. “The children always came out and played with my dog. I really hope they weren’t around to see anything.” A policeman stands guard at the house where Mrs Imran died.

"A federal judge on Sunday struck down Alaska's first-in-the-nation ban on gay marriages, the latest court decision in a busy week for the issue. The state of Alaska will begin accepting those applications first thing Monday morning, according to Phillip Mitchell, with the state Department of Vital Statistics. Alaska has a three-day waiting period between between applications and marriage ceremonies. The late Sunday afternoon decision caught many people off guard. No rallies were immediately planned, but some plaintiffs celebrated over drinks at an Anchorage bar. Matthew Hamby, who along with his husband Christopher Shelden was one of five couples to sue, was 'just having drinks with friends, enjoying it.' He said he was 'elated' that U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Burgess sided with them, and he planned to among the first in line to apply for a license Monday. 'This is just an amazing day for Alaska. We're just so fortunate that so many have fought for equality for so long — I mean, decades,' said Susan Tow, who along with her wife, Chris Laborde, were among couples who sought to overturn Alaska's ban. Scroll down for video . Alaska couple Tracey Wiese (left) and Kat Cortez were among the group who sued to strike the state's ban on gay marriages. U.S. District Judge Timothy Burgess said the ban violates the U.S. constitutional guarantee of due process and equal protection . Chris Laborde and Matt Hamby celebrate after a judge struck down Alaska's ban on gay marriage. Hamby, his husband and Laborde with her wife, along with two of the five couples who sued to overturn the ban . Earlier in the week, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear appeals from several states that were seeking to retain their bans on same-sex marriage. The move on Oct. 6 means that gay marriage is now effectively legal in about 30 states. But much of last week was marked by confusion as lower courts and states worked through when weddings can begin. On Tuesday, a federal appeals court in the West overturned marriage bans in Nevada and Idaho. On Thursday, West Virginia officials began issuing gay marriage licenses, and Kansas' most populous county issued a marriage license Friday to a gay couple, believed to be the first such license in the state. Sunday's ruling in Alaska came in a lawsuit brought by five gay couples who had asked the state in May to overturn a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 1998. The amendment defined marriage as being between one man and one woman. The lawsuit sought to bar enforcement of Alaska's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. It also called for barring enforcement of any state laws that refuse to recognize gay marriages legally performed in other states or countries or that prevent unmarried gay couples from marrying. Burgess heard arguments Friday afternoon and promised a quick decision. He released his 25-page decision Sunday afternoon. 'Refusing the rights and responsibilities afforded by legal marriage sends the public a government-sponsored message that same-sex couples and their familial relationships do not warrant the status, benefits and dignity given to couples of the opposite sex,' Burgess wrote. 'This Court finds that Alaska's same-sex marriage laws violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment because no state interest provides ""excessively persuasive justification"" for the significant infringement of rights that they inflicted upon homosexual individuals,' he wrote. Gov. Sean Parnell said in a statement Sunday he was appealing to defend and uphold the law and the Alaska Constitution. Couple Matthew Hamby (left) and Christopher Shelden speak during a news conference following a hearing in federal court in Anchorage as part of their lawsuit against the state's gay marriage ban . 'Although the district court today may have been bound by the recent 9th Circuit panel opinion, the status of that opinion and the law in general in this area is in flux,' he said. State lawyers were reviewing Burgess decision and working on the next steps to appeal. Joshua Decker, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, said Alaska has no legal chance of prevailing at either the 9th Circuit Court or with the U.S. Supreme Court. 'It's really unfortunate the governor wants to continue to swim against the tide of history and try to perpetuate discrimination against Alaskans,' said Decker. 'We're disappointed but that's not going to dampen our elation.' Hamby said the appeal was 'ridiculous and futile.' He also called it misguided 'because it continues to injure same-sex couples who love each other and just want to get married.' If the state does appeal to the 9th Circuit Court, chances of winning were slim since the federal appeals court already has ruled against Idaho and Nevada, which made similar arguments. Alaska voters in 1998 approved a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as being between one man and one woman. But in the past year, the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that prevented legally married same-sex couples from receiving a range of federal benefits. Federal courts also have since struck down state constitutional bans in a number of states. The plaintiffs are Hamby and Shelden; Laborde and Tow; Sean Egan and David Robinson; Tracey Wiese and Katrina Cortez; and Courtney Lamb and Stephanie Pearson. Lamb and Pearson are unmarried. Tow on Sunday said she was happy for the children of Alaska gay couples who will now see their parents recognized. 'We never thought we'd see this in our lives,' she said.","U.S. Judge Timothy Burgess on Sunday sided with the 'elated' couples who sued to have the right to marry their partners in Alaska .

"Three friends are safely back in the UK after an incredible 11,000 mile, 38 day journey across 17 countries in a 1976 Austin Allegro Estate. Simon Kuznetsov, Vincent Cook, and Alastair Adams drove the classic motor - which they purchased for just £651 on eBay and nicknamed Melanie - from Leeds to Ulan Bator, Mongolia as part of the famous Mongol Rally. The trio burned through nine tyres, battled faulty brakes and lost the exhaust pipe 27 times during the journey. Epic journey: Three friends have completed an 11,000 mile journey from Leeds to Mongolia in a 1976 Austin Allegro . By the time the 38-year-old car spluttered across the finish line in 118th place it had lost its suspension, fuel tank, electronics and windscreen wipers. Racing as 'Lost in Allegro', the team, from Leeds, raised almost £3,000 for their chosen charities Alzheimers Research, Friends of Alfie Martin, Cool Earth and Shelterbox. Engineering teacher Simon, 26, said: 'It was absolutely falling to bits and it’s just amazing that it made it to the finish line. 'Our car limped there and we were determined to get it over the finish line on its own steam.' Incredible feat: The 'Lost in Allegro' team were competing in the Mongol Ralley, crossing the line in 118th place after losing the car's suspension, fuel tank, electronics, windscreen wipers and nine tyres . Vincent, 25, said: 'The best bits were the people we met and the welcomes we received, seeing the world from a new perspective, challenging ourselves, making light of tough situations and raising money for great charities.' The much-loved car is still in Mongolia and waiting to be shipped home so the team can restore it. Teammate Alastair, 25, said: 'It would be way cheaper to just buy another but the car holds a sentimental value now.' Speaking about the experience, he added: 'We learned that the world is a very small place if we can drive a third of it in just over a month in a battered old Allegro. Value for money! Simon Kuznetsov, Vincent Cook, and Alastair Adams purchased the 38-year-old motor for £651 on eBay . 'People are amazing all over the world, especially the lesser-travelled countries like Iran and Turkmenistan. We met some of the most hospitable, kind and helpful people in these countries.' The Mongol Rally, which typically begins in the UK and ends in Mongolia, is described as the 'greatest motoring adventure on the planet'. Participating cars have to be deliberately unsuitable for the challenge, and there is no set route. There are just three rules, as described on the website. Participants must 'take a farcically small vehicle', are 'completely on their own', and must raise at least £1,000 for charity. Adventure: The Mongol Rally is described as the 'greatest motoring adventure on the planet' 'The Mongol Rally is about getting lost, using your long neglected wits, raising shedloads of cash for charity and scraping into the finish line with your vehicle in tatters and a wild grin smeared across your grubby face,' the website states. A feature length documentary of their journey is currently being edited and will be shown released later this year.

"Criminal gang members who arranged to test-drive more than 20 high-value cars before distracting the salesmen and driving off with the vehicles have been jailed. The gang targeted both dealers and private sellers around Yorkshire and Derbyshire, stealing a total of 23 new and second hand cars worth almost £300,000 including a £28,440 Land Rover, £15,750 Audi and a Mercedes C220 sports car. They would arrange for test drives in secluded areas before stealing the cars using a variety of methods to distract salesman or the owners. Ringleaders: Dean Harding, 33, (left) and Ernest Moate, 61, (right) were part of a criminal gang which arranged test-drive more than 20 high-value cars before distracting the salesmen and driving off . Most of the cars taken by the gang between January and April last year were quickly stripped down for parts and only three were recovered. Jailing three of the gang members, Recorder Richard Wright QC told Leeds Crown Court that he was satisfied Ernest Moate, 61, and Dean Harding, 33, played the leading roles in the operation, with Harding the main thief supported by Moate and another man, Richard MacInnes, 38. Gang members would approach car dealerships or private sellers advertising on Autotrader or Gumtree, with the caller giving a false name and background explaining why he wanted the car. Often the caller would pretend to be working as a contractor somewhere remote in Yorkshire or Derbyshire, asking the seller to to bring a vehicle to him for a test drive. The court was told that one of the thefts took place on Janurary 31 last year, when a salesman from the Farnell Land Rover dealership in Bradford dealership was tricked into taking a £28,440 Land Rover to a farm in the village Denby Dale after a potential buyer claimed he was doing some logging in the area. There he met Harding, who was using a false name, and together they drove five miles to nearby Bretton before pulling into a layby. After distracting the salesman, Harding made a dash for the vehicle and sped off. Gang members: A stolen Land Rover was traced to a garage belonging to Daniel Banks, 24, (left). He was jailed for 18 months for handling stolen vehicles, while Richard MacInnes, 38, (right) was jailed for two years, four months for conspiracy to steal vehicles and failing to attend court . Stolen:  A salesman from a Bradford dealership was tricked into taking this £28,440 Land Rover for a test drive, only for it to be stolen by Harding. By the time it was found in Banks's garage it had been fitted with false number plates and the doors and bonnet had been removed . Matthew Donkin, prosecuting, said the salesman alerted his manager and because the vehicle had been fitted with a tracker, activated after the theft was reported, police traced it to a garage belonging to another gang member Daniel Banks, 24, within half an hour. By then the car had been fitted with false number plates was already being stripped down, with the bonnet and doors missing. On February 8 last year another garage, Perry’s Motors in Huddersfield, was contacted by a man who asked for a vehicle to be taken to a quarry at Grange Moor. When the salesman arrived with a Vauxhall Astra a man matching Harding’s description got in for a test drive. He drove to a gated driveway and while the salesman was out to open the gates, Harding drove away. The vehicle was never recovered. The court heard that a private seller in Holmfirth was also contacted about a test drive of his £15,750 Audi, but when the seller went to lock his front door the man drove off in the car. Other cars stolen in the operation included a Mitsubishi LC200, a £14,990 Mercedes C220 sports car, a Ford Transit van worth £20,000, a Range Rover Sport worth £29,000 and a £22,000 Mitsubishi Barbarian. Ringleader Moate, described in court as a 'professional criminal' was jailed for five and a half years after he was convicted of conspiracy to steal motor vehicles. MacInnes was jailed for two years, four months for conspiracy to steal vehicles and failing to attend court, and Banks was jailed for 18 months for handling stolen vehicles. All lived in Barnsley. Harding had been sentenced at a previous hearing when he was jailed for three years and four months for conspiracy to steal vehicles, handling and robbery. Four other gang members were also sentenced for their part in the thefts. Brett Williams, 24, was jailed for two years for handling stolen goods and Robert West, 28, was given a 15 months sentence suspended for two years with 300 hours unpaid work for handling stolen goods. Craig Williams, 25, and Gary Williams, 32, who were each given 10 months in prison suspended for two years with 200 hours unpaid work for handling stolen goods. 'We worked for several months to investigate these offences and as we dug further it became increasingly apparent there were clear links between what at first seemed like isolated offences committed across the Yorkshire region,' said Detective Constable James Bellhouse, who headed the investigation, named Operation Trimgill. 'The investigation was extremely complex and our enquiries included visiting scenes, recovering and viewing hours of CCTV, house to house, forensic opportunities, receiving and evaluating intelligence obtaining and executing warrants, mobile phone work, liaising with other forces, surveillance and also a bit of luck. 'It highlights once again that today’s criminals can operate in a sophisticated fashion, targeting those who are vulnerable. It also demonstrates how well police officers can collaborate across districts and indeed police force areas to catch them.'","Gang targeted car dealers and private sellers in Yorkshire, taking 23 cars .

"A 22-year-old girl who has never had a boyfriend due to a decade of crippling insecurity has had a nose job in the quest to find love. Fiona Todd, who lives in Farnham, Surrey, with her mother, hated the way she looked because of her nose ever 'since she can remember'. At just 12-years-old, Fiona suffered cruel taunts from school bullies who picked on its size and shape, knocking down her self esteem. Scroll down for video . Fiona, pictured before the op, left, and after, right, hated her nose for 10 years and has always wanted surgery . Fiona has never experienced being in a relationship, and felt if she had nose operation she would gain the confidence to go out and seek love. While she has 'always wanted surgery', Fiona finally booked herself in for an operation in March. Two months ago, the public relations executive underwent a rhinoplasty procedure performed by cosmetic surgeon Nick Percival FRCS of Cosmetic Surgery Partners in London. Her family, including an older brother and sister, were concerned. 'I didn't really speak with them. They said I didn't need it done, but that's their point of view,' says Fiona. 'For a decade people have been making comments on it. It made me feel worse about it than I already felt. She says her nose made it difficult for her to talk to people or feel good about herself . Fiona's nose before surgery (left) and how the surgeon predicts it will look after swelling has gone down (right) 'One boy at school would comment on it... My nose made me really lacking in confidence. It made it more difficult to talk to people or feel good about myself. 'Whenever I would meet someone new I would immediately think ""Are they going to think I've got a big nose"". 'It was the first thing I worried about. I would just feel really insecure. 'I'd always wanted the operation but in March this year I decided I was actually going to do it and booked myself in. 'I wanted to raise my confidence and help me find a man.' Fiona went in in the morning, the operation was two hours, and was home by 8pm . Her close friends would say her nose was fine. But they would sometimes make jokes about it, and paranoid Fiona took these to heart. 'My friends were probably saying it was fine to be polite. They knew I hated my nose and wanted it done,' she says. 'I went for the consultation and Dr Nick Percival looked at my nose and what needed to be done, and explained the process. I trusted him on that - at the time that's all that mattered. 'I went in in the morning, the operation was two hours, then my friend came to pick me up and I was home by 8pm. 'When I first woke up I was in pain, but I was on painkillers straight after that. 'Two months on, the results are only going to get better. 'I still can't move the tip of my nose, it's absolutely solid. That can take 6 months to go down,' says Fiona. 'Some people say it doesn't look very different, but the surgeons do it so subtly so as not to make a drastic change. When I look at pictures before and now, that's when I really notice it. 'While I feel much more confident, I haven't been on any dates yet - but I am very fussy and picky, I just haven't found the right one. 'I've tried dating sites but would rather meet someone in person. The operation has given me the confidence to actually go out and meet people and hopefully end up in a happy relationship. 'And when I am with someone one day, to not feel insecure about the way I look.' Fiona, pictured just after surgery (l) and recently (r), can't feel the 'solid' tip of her nose yet, but feels much more confident about her appearance .","Fiona Todd, from Farnham, Surrey, hated her nose for 10 years .

"For TV and movie addicts, it could be the ultimate gadget. A Kickstarter project is aiming to build a robotic projector that can move around the home, taking its TV picture and sound system with it. The $1,900 robot, called Keecker, is controlled by an app. The robot can roll between rooms and project onto any surface . It has a 1080p HD projector built in, as well as a 360 degree sound system. Two wheels allow the robot, which the firm said is a 'home pod' to move around. It will also will have a mapping mode, where it defines where the rooms and walls in your house are, so you can press a button called 'living room' and have the robot wheel over on its own. According to founder Pierre Lebeau, Keecker is hoping to ship its robots in six to eight months. 'We all love the experience of the big screen and great sound in out living room, but elsewhere the experience is just not the same,' he said. The robot can even roll outside and project onto walls . It has a 'short throw' projector so it can still create an image even when close to the surface . The Keecker also acts as a 360 speaker to play music . 'This is why we created Keecker. 'It's a totally new type of computer, we call it a home pod.' Keecker projects any content anywhere you want, it can turn any surface into a screen. 'Keecker is creating something new - imagine your kids going to sleep with the milky way on the ceiling, or waking up to the maldives,' said Lebeau. It's makers say it will also work as a remote security camera, and will even allow them to check on their pets. How it works: The Keecker has a fully functioning Android computer on board . The robot can also project web pages onto any surface . 'When you're away, you can video chat and see what goes on at home . 'Check your pets and talk to them, ensure your house is safe, see if you forgot to lock the window and project yourself back at home from anywhere for live conversations.' The Keecker is a fully functioning Android computer, and can run apps downloaded from the Google Play Store. An app is used to control the gadget and summon it to every room.","Keecker has a projector and 360 sound system built in .

"Despite reports Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus bends in a pocket, and critics claiming its a carbon-copy of Samsung devices - its popularity hasn’t been dented. T-Mobile boss chief executive John Legere has revealed that the larger, phablet device is 'exceeding expectations' - and is on par with the smaller iPhone 6 model. He said he had expected the Plus model to make up around 20 per cent of sales, but this figure has been closer to 45 per cent. Scroll down for video . T-Mobile boss chief executive John Legere (pictured) has revealed that the iPhone 6 Plus is exceeding expectations, and is on par with the smaller iPhone 6 model. He said he had expected the Plus model to make up around 20 per cent of sales, but this figure was closer to 45 per cent . Mr Legere was talking at Recode’s Code/Mobile event in Moon Bay California. He admitted the figures were more than twice the sales his firm had expected. These figures bolster those observed on the weekend the two devices were released back in September. A Piper Jaffray survey found the larger model was outselling the smaller version, and analyst Gene Munster said at the time the Plus was ‘more popular’. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 6 Plus 5.5-inches. Both models include the Apple-designed A8 chip with second generation 64-bit desktop-class architecture, said to boost performance and power efficiency. They also have advanced iSight and FaceTime HD cameras, and users in the US will also be able to use the devices to pay for goods using Apple Pay. Besides larger screens, the new phones offer faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments. In the US, the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for 32GB on a two-year contact, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB. A SIM-only handset starts at £539 in the UK. The iPhone 6 Plus costs $299 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $399 for 64GB, $499 for 128GB. Unlocked, the handset starts at £619 in the UK. In a survey, 57 per cent of shoppers intended to buy the iPhone Plus. With the larger screen, as well as the storage options, cited as the main driving forces. Prior to the release, the firm said it expected customers would ‘overwhelmingly’ prefer the smaller iPhone 6 - seen as the direct upgrade to the iPhone 5S. Figures from marketing firm Localytics earlier this month, however, reported a skew in the opposite direction. By studying app usage and analytics across a range of devices, its figures show the iPhone 6 taking 6 per cent market share, compared to the Plus model’s one per cent. The firm also found that the iPhone 6 is being adopted at twice the rate of its iPhone 5S predecessor - which had a 3 per cent share of all iPhones at this time last year. Although people who have bought the larger model are using it more. According to Localytics, the iPhone 6 Plus has ‘stronger user engagement’ with 13 per cent longer session length, and 11 per cent more app launches than the iPhone 6. Currently, last year’s iPhone 5S is the most popular model among consumers at 27 per cent of all iPhones. Following the launch in September, Apple reported it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models over the first weekend - a three-day record for a new model. According to app analytics firm Localytics, the iPhone 6 Plus has ‘stronger user engagement’ too, with 13 per cent longer session length, and 11 per cent more app launches than the iPhone 6 . Following the launch, Apple reported it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models (pictured) in a weekend - a three-day record for a new model. This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C . This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C. And during initial benchmark tests by Anandtech, the iPhone 6 was found to have the fastest web browsing and page loading times on any device, just ahead of the iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 also performed well in graphics testing, coming second with an average frame per second rate of 49.5. This was only behind the NVIDIA Shield tablet, on 57.1. The iPhone 5S was third, on 40.2, followed by the iPhone 6 Plus on 34.4. Furthermore, the display on the iPhone 6 Plus was praised by experts at DisplayMate, who called the screen ‘the best performing smartphone LCD’ the site has ever tested. But, other figures from Localytics report a sales skew in the opposite direction.

"It sounds like they're not 'lovin' it' as much as they used to. The world's biggest fast food chain has unveiled a new slogan in an attempt to stop its sales from sinking. 'Lovin Beats Hatin' will be launched next year, and is a campaign aimed to spread happiness in the face of Internet hate. Scroll down for video . According to reports. McDonald's new slogan 'Lovin Beats Hatin', will be launched next year at the Super Bowl . According to the Wall Street Journal, the roll-out will include a spot during Super Bowl XLIX on February 1. The marketing ploy comes at a time when worldwide sales dropped by 30 per cent in the third quarter of last year. The current catchphrase 'I'm Lovin' It' will still remain as a global slogan. An inside source said the change is aimed 'to spread happiness in the face of Internet hate,' but the WSJ did not elaborate on what that precisely means. Officially, the company is staying mum about the possibility. 'We're always working with our partners on great new creative,' said a spokesperson. 'It's highly speculative and premature to talk about Super Bowl ads and future campaigns for next year.' The reported change will come during a tough time for the world's largest hamburger chain. After posting yet another disappointing quarter, McDonald's CEO Don Thompson admitted last week that the company hasn't been keeping up with the times and that changes are in store for its U.S. restaurants. BAD FOOD IMAGE . To defend the image of its food, McDonald's launched a social media campaign last week inviting customers to ask questions about the ingredients it uses. Showing just how bad perceptions can be, among the first questions McDonald's addressed were 'Why doesn't your food rot?' and 'Do you use real chicken in your Chicken McNuggets?' The company has run similar programs in Canada and Australia, where it says the program has built trust with customers. LACK OF FLEXIBILITY . Consistency has long been one of McDonald's attractions - people like knowing exactly what they'll get when they order a Big Mac. But now people are gravitating toward places like Chipotle that let people tailor their orders. To offer greater customization down the line, McDonald's recently rolled out prep tables in its kitchens that can hold more toppings and sauces. The company is also testing a build-your-own-burger offering in southern California that lets people pick the bun, patty and toppings they want. In Australia, McDonald's has already said it plans to roll out the format nationwide. SLOW, INACCURATE SERVICE . McDonald's executives have said they introduced too many items too quickly last year, such as McWraps and the option to substitute egg whites for its breakfast sandwiches. That slowed down service and led to inaccurate orders. On Tuesday, McDonald's said it would focus on a simplified menu that highlights its most popular items but did not give specifics. PRICE SENSITIVITY . Raising prices without driving away customers has been tricky for McDonald's. At one time, for instance, the popular Dollar Menu included a Big N' Tasty, which was made with a quarter-pound of beef. But over the years, McDonald's has had to swap out items as costs for beef and cheese have climbed. Late last year, McDonald's revamped its Dollar Menu to be called the 'Dollar Menu & More,' with a range of prices up to $5. INCREASED COMPETITION . In addition to newer players like Chipotle, longtime rivals Burger King and Wendy's have been intensifying competition, too. And Taco Bell launched a national breakfast menu to go after the growing breakfast market. Business Insider reports that the new slogan has received negative comments online, with Twitter users condemning the chain for their decision. Thompson said that starting in January McDonald's will 'simplify' its menu to make room for restaurants to offer options that are best-suited for their regions. To offer greater customization, he also said the company planned to expand its 'Create Your Taste' offering that lets people pick the buns and toppings they want on burgers by tapping a touchscreen. The program is currently being offered in Southern California, and McDonald's has said it will roll it out nationally in Australia. 'We haven't been changing at the same rate as our customers' eating-out expectations,' Thompson conceded during a conference call outlining the changes. Feeling the pinch: While McDonald's sales tank, restaurants with a more 'wholesome' image are flourishing. As a result, people have been gravitating to places like Chipotle, which markets its ingredients as being of superior quality . As more and more consumers turn their backs on the Golden Arches, McDonald's recently launched its first ever consumer outreach exercise, inviting customers to ask questions on their Our Food Your Questions website. The remarks came after McDonald's said sales at established locations fell 3.3 percent globally and in the U.S. division, marking the fourth straight quarter of declines in its home market. Profit sank 30 percent. The changes come as McDonald's continues to struggle with myriad problems. One of its biggest challenges in the U.S. is long-held perceptions around the freshness and quality of its ingredients. The chain has been fighting to boost sales as people gravitate toward foods they feel are more wholesome. As a result, people have been gravitating to places like Chipotle, which markets its ingredients as being of superior quality. McDonald's, which has more than 35,000 locations around the world, said it expects its challenges will continue into the current quarter, with global sales down for October as well. For the quarter, revenue declined to $6.99 billion, short of the $7.23 billion Wall Street expected. Net income declined to $1.07 billion, or $1.09 per share. Adjusted for one-time costs, earnings were $1.52 per share. Analysts expected $1.37 per share.","Fast food giant's new catchphrase 'Lovin Beats Hatin' will debut next year .

"Mark Llewellyn, the executive producer of Seven’s prime time current affairs current affairs program Sunday Night apparently was involved in a newsroom brawl at the program's Sydney headquarters this week. Lewellyn, a highly-regarded professional, who has been working as executive producer of the show since 2006, apparently had a disagreement with producer Paul Waterhouse over a story Mr Waterhouse had been researching. It is alleged that Mr Llewellyn was unimpressed with the angle of the story and 'threw' Mr Waterhouse against a wall, tearing his shirt. Mark Llewellyn, the executive producer of Channel 7's prime time current affairs show, Sunday night, has been accused of physically attacking a producer at the station's Eveleigh headquarters . The altercation began in the Sunday Night newsroom and carried on into Mr Llewellyn's office. Things apparently escalated quickly and Sunday Night reporter Ross Coulthart and producer Nick Farrow were forced to step in to break the two producers apart. It is understood that Seven’s human resources department is investigating the incident, after some members of staff threatened to walk off the show in protest. Following formal procedure, it is believed that the Seven Network asked Mr Llewellyn to take a two-week advance on his annual leave. Mr Llewellyn reportedly sent an email around the office yesterday to inform staff that he is now on leave. It is believed Mr Llewellyn has been under immense pressure following extreme budget cuts at the station and huge amounts of tension in a dwindling office. Sunday Night has reportedly been under pressure recently after it became locking in a ratings battle with rival show Nine's 60 minutes . 'They had a dust up in the newsroom in a production meeting in which Llewelyn threw him (Mr Waterhouse) into a wall,'a Channel 7 source told Daily Mail Australia. One member of staff reportedly commented on how ironic it was that the office had recently been compelled to attend a bullying and conflict resolution workshop. Mr Llewellyn has carved out an impressive career within the media industry since he began in 1983. He was the first Australian journalist on the Iran-Iraq border at the end of the first Iraq war. Mr Llewellyn has also covered the Cannes film festival for Today Tonight and produced the network’s acclaimed 2008 Anzac Day coverage live from Gallipoli. The TV news boss left Nine in difficult circumstances in 2006 after he revealed in court documents that Nine’s CEO Eddie McGuire wanted to “bone” the Today show host Jessica Rowe. Sunday Night has reportedly been under pressure recently after it became locking in a ratings battle with rival show, Nine's 60 minutes. It is understood Mr Waterhouse has raised the possibility of pressing charges against Llewellyn.","Executive producer of Seven's Sunday Night show, Mark Llewellyn, reportedly got involved in a newsroom brawl with producer Paul Waterhouse .

"Millions of Australians could be at risk of credit default, as changes in credit reporting regimes tighten the reigns on payment records. New reports reveal that 13% of the estimated 16 million Australians who use credit are at risk, with nearly 600,000 being considered facing 'high risk' of defaulting. This means that nearly two million Australians could be refused credit applications unless immediate action is taken to improve their financial records. New reports reveal that 13% of the estimated 16 million Australians who use credit are at risk, with nearly 600,000 being considered facing 'high risk' of defaulting. Analysis conducted by credit agency Veda indicates that 16% of Queensland residents are at risk of defaulting within the next year. In Victoria and NSW, the likelihood is 13%, and in the ACT 10% are at risk. The figures also show that Australians in their 30's and 40's are in the highest risk bracket, as they tend to have young families and may be facing higher levels of financial stress. 'They need to make sure they pay the minimum balance on their credit card, pay their utility bills including electricity, gas and phone bills on time and make sure they keep track of the credit commitments,’ Veda spokewoman Belinda Diprose told The Herald Sun. 'For people who are struggling they should talk to their credit provider and don’t suffer in silence.' 'There’s often hardship requirements that a credit provider can activate and it can help consumers ride themselves out of what potentially could result in a default on their credit file.’' The new credit reporting scheme was lobbied for by many credit agencies within Australia and was launched in March. Under the scheme, a comprehensive payment history will be recorded and will mean that a credit default will occur sooner. Missed payments will be recorded, resulting in a default, after 14 days, rather than the previous allowance of up to 60 days . Comprehensive reporting has been utilised within the United States for many years, and uses a credit score, among other factors, to determine whether to approve a loan. Within Australia, this credit score comes under the VedaScore system, which is a number up to 1200 that encompasses an individual's credit record. On average, the national credit score is 760, with a score of 200 or less meaning that a person has a 50% chance of experiencing an 'adverse credit event' within the next year. Figures show that Australians in their 30's and 40's are in the highest risk bracket, as they tend to have young families and may be facing higher levels of financial stress. Once an individual is listed as having defaulted, they will be listed on the BayCorp, the national default register, for 5-7 years. The new scheme may provide some benefits to Australians, as it collects more information and will allow people with poor credit ratings to prove they have improved their financial behaviour. As the information collected will include detailed repayment history on credit reports, it will make applying for mortages and loans simpler. In June this year, lender SocietyOne announced that it would be using risk-based pricing for determining the outcome of loan applications. Under this scheme, borrowers with the highest credit ratings will receive lower interest rates in contrast to those with lower credit ratings.

"The heartbreaking wills of soldiers who fell on the Western Front have been revealed for the first time, 100 years after they were written. The documents, some penned by boys as young as 14, offer a rare glimpse into what life was like for many of the soldiers before war began on July 28, 1914. Among them are emotional farewells from teenagers to their mothers and romantic pledges from husbands and lovers leaving their possessions to the women they left at home. The last testaments of soldiers on the Western Front have been revealed to commemorate the centenary of the First World War . Each member of the British and Commonwealth Army was required to compose a will following the outbreak of war. Kept in their pocketbooks, many of the surviving documents bear signs of the battlefield be it bullet-holes or dust. One letter, written by a Private Horace Henry Cook who died in the first battle of Ypres on November 1, 1914, reveals his love for a girlfriend he would never be able to make his wife. Writing of Beatrice Brown from Westham, London, he instructed: 'She is to be treated in all possible respects as my wife, which would have been the case.' Another soldier's final letter to his mother describes the torrid conditions endured by servicemen at the beginning of the First World War. 'We have to fight like tigers to get our food here. 'This war is going to be worse than I thought. Some seem to think it won't last a month and some say it will last three years. 'If I never come home again I leave the boy in your charge and I know you will do your best to him. 'I have got to make my will this afternoon. I shall make it out to you everything of what I possess. So if I go under and you do not get anything you must apply for it. Among the letters and wills are those from young men to their mothers to whom they leave all their possessions . The letters are among millions of records which have been made public to commemorate the war . One of the letters was written by a young man who  died in the Battle of Ypres (depicted) on November 1 1914 . 'If I get killed in Active Service, there will be a medal for me somewhere and I hope you will try and get it and keep it for the boy to wear when he grows up. 'We carry a little book with us to enter all payments and made to us and it has got a poem of will in it.' Courts Minister Helen Grant said: ‘This fascinating project has opened the door to a whole new insight on our war heroes – it has given us the opportunity for the first time to hear the thoughts and emotions of the brave soldiers who died for this country in their own words. ‘It is a great example of the innovation going on throughout Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service to provide a modern and efficient service to the public.’","Letters revealed to commemorate 100 years since the start of the war .

"A helpless lion was crushed to death by a relentless stampede of buffalo who gored him and jumped on his head. The lion, who had earlier been forced out of his pride, was spotted by the large group of buffalo, who are thought to have picked up on his scent in the Kruger National Park in South Africa . As the stampede moved closer, the lion tried to make a run for it but as he was injured from a previous fight, he was too slow. Scroll down for video . The lion, who had earlier been forced out of his pride and beaten, attempts to hide from the herd of buffalo in the long grass . But after a change in wind direction, the buffalo pick up on the lion's scent and begin to stampede towards the big cat . The lion attempts to run away from the incoming buffalo, even though he was weak and sore from a previous attack by other lions . The lion then lay down in the long grass in a bid to hide but he was eventually spotted by the herd. Eventually the buffalo caught up with him, before goring him, jumping on his death and crushing him to death. The moment the lion was trampled was caught on camera by game ranger, Lyle Gregg, who had spotted the animal during an early morning drive. The 37-year-old added that the lion was well-known to rangers in the area as he had been deposed from his pack. But despite the lion's best efforts at running away, the buffalo catch up with him, and initially knock him on to the ground . The buffalo then begin to gore the lion with their horns to make sure he can't escape as more animals begin to charge in . The stampede was captured on camera by game ranger Lyle Gregg, who had spotted the animal during an early morning drive around Kruger National Park . He explained: 'This male belonged to a pride which I knew very well, I had seen him everyday for two years. 'He had just been forced out by a coalition of five males from a different pride and we were concerned about him because he had taken a huge beating by the coalition just days before. 'As we sat there watching him I heard buffalo calling and remember saying to my guests that if this is a big herd he could be in trouble."" He added: 'The herd got to about thirty metres away and were walking past him when all of a sudden the wind changed direction and the buffalo picked up on his scent. After goring him, Mr Greg said that the buffalo then began to stamp on top of the lion's head and added that the attack on the big cat was relentless . The management of Kruger Park in South Africa, where the attack took place, confirmed that the lion did not survive the buffalo attack . 'They moved closer towards him until he decided to make a run for it but he was too weak and too sore. 'The attack was relentless from about two dozen of the buffalo. After the initial hit they just gored him on the ground until a big bull jumped on his head.' Kruger Park Management confirmed that the lion did not survive the attack. However, they added that he did have four male offspring, who have begun mating with females and have inherited a vast territory.","Lion had earlier been forced out of his pride and was spotted by an incoming large herd of buffalo .

"Japan's Crown Princess is back in the public eye after 11 years as she continues to recover from a stress-related illness. Princess Masako accompanied her husband, Crown Prince Naruhito, at an imperial banquet for visiting King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands. It was her first appearance at an imperial banquet since she attended one for the Mexican president in October 2003 having lived largely as a recluse since then. Scroll down for video .

The 50-year-old became ill soon after giving birth to the couple's daughter, Aiko, now 12, and largely withdrew from official duties. The princess, in a silky white formal dress and a silver tiara, smiled as she talked with Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders, seated next to her, over French food at the banquet, part of which was shown on television news. About 160 guests, including other royals and political leaders such as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, also attended. Earlier on Wednesday, the princess attended a welcoming ceremony for the king hosted by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. She greeted Queen Maxima, with both women wearing hues of orange, the Dutch national color.

Akihito, in his banquet-opening speech, touched on Japan's aggression during World War II in the Dutch-occupied Indonesia, where many soldiers and civilians from the Netherlands were taken prisoners. 'It was most unfortunate that these long friendly relations between Japan and the Netherlands should have been marred because of World War II,' Akihito said. 'While never forgetting this past, we hope to give more attention than ever to the promotion of good will between our two countries.' Willem-Alexander said the Dutch people's ordeal should not be forgotten, but understanding of each other's pains is the foundation of reconciliation.","Princess Masako has attended first imperial banquet in more than a decade .

"An anthropologist has found that when it comes to stereotyping the English, the use of the word 'typical' is as much a tell tale sign of nationality as a love of tea and a Sunday roast. Social anthropologist Kate Fox said the word could almost be a 'national catchphrase', such is its popularity. Miss Fox, the author of bestseller Watching The English, told the  Cheltenham Literary Festival that a love of 'typical' stems from the collectively enjoyed feeling that the English have the power of foresight over our lives. Just typical: Social anthropologist Kate Fox said the word 'typical' could almost be a 'national catchphrase', such is its popularity among the English . She described the word as being 'quintessentially English', according to the Telegraph, and said it was suitable as a response to 'any disaster, from a burnt bit of toast to the outbreak of World War Three'. She added: ‘You have to be able to say it in a way that sounds simultaneously peeved but also stoically resigned and shruggy. 'And at the same time smugly omniscient - almost pleased that your predictions have been fulfilled. Study: Miss Fox's book Watching The English was first published in 2004 . 'Everything may have gone pear shaped but you have not been taken unawares.' In her book, first published in 2004, Miss Fox adds that other commonly used English catchphrases included 'oh come off it', 'mustn't grumble', 'Sod's law' and 'bound to rain: it's a bank holiday'. She has also said that amongst the English, vocabulary can be an indicator of class, with the higher classes preferring to use 'loo' or 'lavatory' to 'toilet', and 'napkin' rather than serviette'. Those in the lower-middle and middle-middle classes eat their food in portions, while upper-middles and above have helpings. Miss Fox, co-director of the Social Issues Research Centre, also told her audience on Sunday that she had underestimated the ‘magical properties’ of tea - the nation's favourite drink - when she joked about it in the first edition of her book. She said: ‘Of course, the next thing I saw was that, in the 7/7 bombings in London, concerned shop keepers rushed out to give aid and comfort to the walking wounded. ‘What did they take apart from blankets? Cups of tea. ‘You can imagine those shop keepers looking out and thinking oh God, I’ll put the kettle on.’ Typical . Oh come off it . Mustn't grumble . Sod's law . Bound to rain: it's a bank holiday . Never mind . Better make the best of it . There's always something . As per usual . I could have told you . She also spoke about the impact of the internet and social media on our national identity, saying it had helped us become less reserved. She said: ‘The only thing that’s significantly changed is the advent of social media, where the English lose some of their Englishness. It’s a bit like being drunk. ‘The English online are uninhibited. ‘It’s like you’re down the pub.’ And she added that almost one third of English people would not display the Cross of St George because it has become associated with football fans and lager louts,while a quarter were put off by its links to far-Right extremists. Miss Fox said 83 per cent of the English feel some pride in their country, with only 3 per cent never feeling proud of it. She told the Cheltenham Literature Festival most in England were ‘closet patriots’, but two-thirds did not know the date of St George’s Day (April 23), and three-quarters did not mark it.","Social anthropologist Kate Fox says 'typical' is 'quintessentially English'

"A new disposable paper cone that helps men to urinate accurately could save 'millions of lives', by detecting the early signs of diabetes and prostate cancer. The flushable invention is slipped on to the penis to ensure a straight aim while urinating. But the device goes further than merely preventing unhygienic splashes in the bathroom. The device harbours a number of reagents which react to foreign bodies, including blood and glucose, in urine causing the paper to change colour, alerting men to potentially life-threatening health problems. Aim-Straight is the brainchild of UK inventors Michael Shelton and Peter Maxwell. They believe it could also help stop the spread of sexually transmitted infections, as well as cut drink-drive convictions. A new disposable paper cone that helps men to urinate accurately could 'save millions of lives', by detecting the early signs of diabetes and prostate cancer, its makers claim . In the last seven years, the product has evolved from a simple paper cone helping men urinate more accurately, to the flushable diagnostic medical device it is today. Mr Shelton told MailOnline: 'With the stigma of a visit to the doctor, along with the saving in the doctor's valuable time in the earliest stage of diagnosis, this could really be a game-changer for preventative health. 'A user of the product would be able to see any immediate change in the reagent and then make the call to the GP for further investigation.' In developing Aim-Straight, the company carried out market research in Japan, identified as a key market with more than 40 million adult males. They found that 84 per cent of those surveyed approved of the product, with 71 per cent confirming they would use the device. Various reagents - substances used in a chemical reaction to detect or measure other substances - are incorporated into the lower tip of the paper cone. They react to irregular levels of foreign matter, including blood, protein and glucose, in the urine allowing Aim-Straight to signal an early warning for conditions including diabetes and prostate cancer. The company behind the invention claim it can also promote penile health. They say the paper cone can clean, medicate and dry the penis thanks to a hypo-allergenic antibacterial agent it contains. A spokesman said: 'Gynaecologists have recommended regular use of the product since Aim-Straight's sanitising action can help to stop the spread of sexually transmitted infections including chlamydia, herpes, and genital warts. Aim-Straight is a flushable cone that is slipped on to the penis to ensure a straight aim while urinating . Special substances in the cone react to abnormal levels of sugar, blood and protein in urine changing colour to alert a person to the early signs of illnesses including diabetes and prostate cancer . 'It can also prevent the spread of the human papilloma virus (HPV) that leads to cervical cancer.' Another key use, the company says, is that the reagent can be one specifically designed to detect alcohol levels. It means Aim-Straight could aid a man's aim after a couple of pints, while also acting as a means of measuring his blood alcohol level, indicating whether he is over the legal drink-drive limit. The spokesman said: 'As well as potentially saving lives, companies that demonstrate a corporate responsibility to staff welfare by installing dispensers will, not only benefit from reduced illness due to early diagnosis and therefore saving thousands in lost productivity, but will also positively impact the finances of health care service providers globally. 'Aim-Straight helps men aim accurately minimising any unhygienic splash back or drips, a benefit not just to all ages but also for those with degress of disability, and the obese. 'Accurate urination reduces the hazard of wet floors, cuts cleaning and the need for air fresheners. 'After a single-use, the Aim-Straight flushes away and disintegrates so is environmentally friendly. 'Wives, mothers, partners and cleaning contractors around the world will applaud this apparently simple invention.' The disposable cones stack easily inside one another and are intended to be sold for domestic use in packs of 28, with dispensers also available. The company say their innovative product is inexpensive, equating to just pennies per use, 'a small price to pay for daily health checks'. And there are plans for flat-packed versions, suitable for those in the armed forces, sportsmen, travellers and commuters. The company are currently in the process of finalising development of the product in order to bring it to market. Men suffering prostate problems can urinate faster and more effectively by sitting down rather than standing up, a new study has found. For those suffering conditions including lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), sitting down will allow them to urinate faster, with greater force, while leaving less urine behind in their bladder. A team of scientists at the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands sought to investigate the benefits of men sitting down while urinating compared to standing. A new study published in the journal PLOS ONE found men suffering prostate problems can urinate faster and more effectively by sitting down rather than standing . They searched 14 medical databases, selecting 11 viable studies from 96 different studies from 2,352 publications. The researchers said: 'We found that in patients with LUTS the sitting position is associated with a trend towards a more favourable urodynamic profile.' Their findings confirmed men with LUTS who sat down while urinating did so faster, for longer, with greater pressure and released more urine than those with LUTS who stood. The team suggest one reason sitting is more effective, is due to the fact typical LUTS patients are elderly males who are prone to fall. 'It is suggested that the fear of falling while standing can result in involuntary contractions of the pelvic muscles to stablise one's position,' the researchers said. 'Contraction of the pelvic muscles is related to disturbed urinary flow.' The study was published in the PLOS ONE journal.","Manufacturers claim the single-use product will save millions of lives .

"With Sainsbury’s already facing increasingly tough competition from low-cost supermarkets, the staff motivational poster accidentally placed in its shop window earlier this week did it no favours. And now the sign - which promoted the ‘Fifty Pence Challenge’ campaign, urging Sainsbury’s employees to encourage their customers to spend more money in store - has been mocked by Lidl. The budget store took out a half-page advert in two national newspapers today, which contained similar images to the Sainsbury’s poster, and also had the heading ‘Fifty Pence Challenge’. Scroll down for video . Mockery: The budget store Lidl took out a half-page advert in a national newspaper today, which contained similar images and layout to the Sainsbury’s poster, and also contained the heading 'Fifty Pence Challenge' But the wording of the advert said: ‘Let’s encourage every one of our lovely customers to save as many 50ps as possible. #LidlSurprises’. Arnd Pickhardt, advertising and marketing director of Lidl UK, told MailOnline today: ‘We saw an opportunity to show - in a light-hearted way - how our customers can make savings of 50p and beyond by shopping with us. ‘As part of our #LidlSurprises campaign, we're always looking for fun ways to surprise and delight our customers.’ And Lidl was not the only firm enjoying the gaffe, with delivery service iPostParcels posting a tweet saying: 'Fifty pence challenge - save 50p with us, you may need it when you shop at Sainsbury's'. Along with this was an image with the words: 'Fifty pence challenge: Let's encourage every customer to save 50p during each parcel booking between now and the month-end. Use code: Save50p.' It comes after the Sainsbury's poster - which encouraged staff to try to make shoppers ‘spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip’ - was accidentally placed on the front window of a store. On display: The sign in the window of a Sainsbury's store in Stratford, east London, urged staff to try to make shoppers 'spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip'. This photo was taken by passer-by Chris Dodd . The sign was spotted by TV freelancer Chris Dodd outside the store in Stratford, east London. He posted a photograph of the sign on Twitter and it has since been retweeted almost 5,000 times, with Sainsbury's confirming that the poster was ‘intended for colleague areas in the store’. The sign - with pictures of a purse and 50p coin - said: ‘Fifty pence challenge: Let’s encourage every customer to spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip between now and the year-end.’ Mr Dodd tweeted Sainsbury's on Monday, saying: ‘Not sure this is supposed to be in your window’, before an employee replied: ‘Yeah, I don't think so either. Which store was this? I'll give them a call.’ But responding to the worker - who identified himself as ‘Ross’ - Mr Dodd then said: ‘Oh I'm not sure about that, Ross... I kinda (sic) like that they're giving folks a heads up!’ Ross replied: ‘Understood. I'd really appreciate you letting me know which store though.’ Getting involved: Lidl was not the only firm enjoying the gaffe, with delivery service iPostParcels posting a picture on Twitter, saying: Fifty pence challenge: Let's encourage every customer to save 50p' Mr Dodd, enjoying the discussion, went on to ask Ross a further question and decided to create his own hashtag: ‘How are staff supposed to encourage the extra 50p spend? #50pChallenge.’ But Ross replied: ‘This is clearly a poster meant for staff areas. I'd really like to make sure it gets to where it should be.’ On Tuesday, after the picture went viral on Twtitter, Mr Dodd said: 'Astonished by all the RT's (retweets) of #50pChallenge - I think I now qualify to go on Celeb Big Brother - so that's a bonus.' And, speaking to The Daily Telegraph after the fallout over the Sainsbury's gaffe, said: ‘I think the real mistake Sainsbury's has made is to present this to staff as a challenge. ‘As a customer, I don't want to feel like I'm being forced or tricked into spending extra by staff who have been challenged to make me do so. Error: The poster was ‘mistakenly put on public display’ at this Sainsbury’s store in east London (file picture) ‘Had the poster encouraged better customer service, or more effective promotions, I doubt there would have been this kind of reaction.’ A Sainsbury’s spokesman told MailOnline earlier this week: ‘We often use posters to make store targets fun and achievable for our colleagues. ‘They are intended for colleague areas in the store, but this one was mistakenly put on public display.’ The company added that nobody was facing disciplinary action over the error, but it would be ‘reminding teams on the guidelines for displaying internal posters’. PR expert Mark Borkowski told The Guardian that the error was ‘embarrassing and not useful’ for Sainsbury’s - but the retailer had ‘much bigger issues’ such as competition in the grocery business. Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s has launched a strategic review which could see Britain’s third-largest grocer cut its dividend as it became the latest big chain to announce a disappointing trading update. Conversation: Mr Dodd tweeted Sainsbury's on Monday to say: 'Not sure this is supposed to be in your window' The supermarket cut its annual sales forecast and also said the review would leave ‘no stone unturned’. It is clear that shoppers in Britain are changing the way they do their food shopping. They are switching to the discounters and smaller convenience stores as well as online. This has hurt established players with both Morrisons and Tesco having issued a raft of recent profits warnings. Sainsbury’s said that more consumers were now choosing to go to restaurants rather than eat at home and this was one of the factors behind underlying second quarter trading falling 2.8 per cent. First-half sales fell 2.1 per cent. The news sent the shares down 7 per cent or 17.5p to 234p to a six-year low. This morning, Sainsbury's fell by another 1.5 per cent or 3.4p to 230.5p. More than £1billion was wiped off the value of Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrison combined yesterday.","Sainsbury's sign urged staff to encourage customers to spend more money .

"Women dislike having a female boss at work even more than men do, a new study has revealed. Nearly 40 per cent of female workers in America would rather be led by a man, a Gallup survey found. In contrast, just 26 per cent of men would prefer a male boss, with 58 per cent not caring either way. Scroll down for video . Findings: A new study has found that only one-fifth of people would prefer to have a female boss if they were to take a new job, compared to one-third who would prefer male. Forty six per cent would not mind . Contrast: Overall, women were more likely than men to want a male boss in the workplace, with 39 per cent wanting to be led by a man, 25 per cent preferring a female boss and 34 per cent having no preference . The study, which collected responses from 1,032 U.S. adults, found that only one-fifth of people would prefer to have a female boss if they were to take a new job. This included a greater percentage of women than men, at 25 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. However, overall, women were more likely than men to want a male boss, with 39 per cent wanting to be led by someone of the opposite gender, and 34 per cent having no preference. In the past 60 years that Gallup has conducted the annual survey, women have never preferred a female boss. But support for female management has grown among both men and women over time. Dislike: Over the past 60 years, women have never said they would prefer to have a female boss (file image) In the first study in 1953, only five per cent of Americans preferred having a female boss, 66 per cent wanted a male boss and 25 per cent did not mind either way. The recent survey also revealed workers who currently have a female boss were more likely to opt to be led by a woman, compared to those with a male boss, at 27 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. Women's dislike of female bosses in the workplace could be partly due to widespread negative perceptions of women in management positions, BusinessWeek.com reported. According to Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's book, Lean In, women can mistrust, and undermine each other at work - with 95 per cent of working females having encountered this. Figures: The recent survey also revealed workers who currently have a female boss were more likely to opt to be led by a woman, compared to those with a male boss, at 27 per cent and 15 per cent respectively . Meanwhile, although the number of female CEOs of Fortune 500 companies has this year reached a historic high, only 4.8 per cent of this elite group are women. Earlier this year, a Cancer Research UK study found that women are still lacking in self-confidence, not putting themselves forward for promotion, and perceive men to have advantages over them. A quarter of the women (26 per cent) interviewed said they felt that adopting stereotypical male characteristics could help them to get to the top of their field. Meanwhile, One in five women (20 per cent) believed gender discrimination at work had made it more difficult for them to reach their career goals. Preference: Women's dislike of female bosses could be partly due to  negative perceptions of women in management positions. Above, nearly 40 per cent of women would rather be led by a man (file image) And over a third (38 per cent) said lack of confidence in their own abilities and a reluctance to push for promotions (37 per cent) was making it harder for them to reach progress up the ladder. Other potential barriers for women making the leap into management positions were found to include lack of flexible working arrangements to allow for childcare and the 'negative' attitudes of employers and colleagues with regard to balancing work and family life.","Nearly 40 per cent of women would rather have a male boss, study found .

"A schoolteacher from New Jersey has returned from her trip to South Africa with a remarkable up-close photo of a great white shark that has been making waves on social media. Amanda Brewer, 25, an art teacher from Gloucester County, traveled halfway across the world to volunteer as a scientific data collector for White Shark Africa - an organization dedicated to animal conservation and eco-tourism. Brewer, a lifelong shark enthusiast and amateur photographer, was enjoying cage diving in Mossel Bay off Seal Island one day hoping to catch a glimpse of the much-maligned sea creatures - and she didn’t have to wait long. Cue 'Jaws' muisc: Amanda Brewer, 25, an art teacher from New Jersey, took this incredible picture while cage diving in Mossel Bay, South Africa . Shark selfie: Brewer, pictured here with a much smaller shark, traveled to Africa to volunteer as a scientific data collector for White Shark Africa . Bait: The female shark was lured with two fish heads being pulled on a rope around the cage . The daredevil teacher had her new GoPro trained on the surface of the water when a hulking female shark appeared directly in front of her, its enormous maw bristling with razor-sharp teeth open wide. In Brewer's photo, which has since become a viral sensation, the steel-grey beast emerges from emerald-colored waters, lured by a pair of fish heads tied to a rope as bait. ‘I wasn't even a little bit frightened,’ Brewer boasted to Time Lightbox about the fateful moment. ‘When you're there and you're in their presence, it's not scary. They're beautiful and graceful, and you can see how intelligent they are.’ The art teacher said she took about 30 shots with the camera in burst mode, but none was as dramatic as that one toothy picturet. Best in show: With her GoPro camera in burst mode, Brewer took 30 snapshots, but only one stood out . Behind bars: Brewer photographed the graceful sea creature from the safety of a partially submerged cage . Sharkservationist: The art teacher described herself as a life-long shark enthusiast . Matter of perception: Brewer noted that the fish eye lens on her camera made the shark appear closer to the cage than it was in reality . 'I knew immediately that that photo was going to do something,' Brewer told Time Lightbox. Upon her return home, Brewer hung her now-famous picture of the shark with its mouth agape in her classroom at Whitman Elementary School in Washington Township to inspire her young students. The vivid snapshot has been shared thousands of times on social media sites and has been the subject of fawning news articles, blog posts and TV segments. But Brewer also has been subjected to criticism from shark advocates over the use of bait in the taking of the photo. Speaking to GrindTV, the New Jersey educator explained that the fish heads used to lure the shark were pulled around and out of the way of the cage to make sure the sea creature didn't lunge and the steel bars. Courting controversy: Some people have criticized Brewer for using bait to lure the hulking fish, but the shark enthusiast pointed out that precautions have been taken to make sure the shark stays away from the cage . ‘That’s one thing that we learned right off the bat, is that you never want the shark to make contact with the cage,’ she noted. ‘And you also don’t want the shark to eat the bait. You don’t feed the sharks; that’s not what we want to do.’ Brewer added that the fish-eye lens on her camera made the shark appear closer to her than it was in reality, which was about 3 feet from the cage. She said the shark came out of nowhere, and she was simply at the right place and at the right time with her trusty GoPro at the ready. ‘I’d been waiting for this kind of experience my whole life,’ Brewer told LightBox. The makers of GoPro took notice of Brewer's ringing endorsement of their camera and featured her photo on their Twitter account, which helped the shark-tastic snapshot go viral.","Amanda Brewer, 25, an art teacher from New Jersey, took the snapshot with a GoPro camera in Mossel Bay off Seal Island .

"Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is considering matching online prices from competitors like Amazon.com, to raise the stakes for the holiday shopping season. The world's largest retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, has matched prices of local store competitors but has not followed other retailers including Best Buy and Target in matching prices of online rivals. But last month, Wal-Mart started to test the strategy in five markets: Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas; Phoenix; and northwest Arkansas. A shopper is pictured at Wal-Mart ahead of Christmas last year, as the store tries to match online prices for this year's holiday wars . The move was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday. Wal-Mart is trying to rev up sluggish sales in the U.S. as it battles competition from online retailers, and dollar chains and drug stores. Wal-Mart's namesake business, which accounts for 60 percent of its total business, hasn't reported growth in a key sales measure in six straight quarters. But matching prices from sellers who don't have the costs associated with running brick-and-mortar stores could also hurt profits. Deisha Barnett, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman says many store managers have matched online prices for customers on a case-by-case basis. 'Taking care of the customers who shop our stores is what we always aim to do,' she added. Wal-Mart has been trying to reclaim its role as the low price leader. This year, it rolled out an online tool called Savings Catcher that compares prices on thousands of products with those of some of its store competitors. If the tool finds a lower price elsewhere, it refunds the difference to shoppers in the form of a store credit. That's different from traditional pricing matching because Savings Catcher does the work for the customer. Wal-Mart has had a price-matching strategy with physical stores for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.","Wal-Mart stores are set to match prices with Amazon.com and other rivals .

"Top fashion brands are on the cusp of designing larger pockets for jeans in order to fit Apple's new iPhone range. At 5.5 inches the iPhone 6 Plus is larger than most other  smart phones on the market. It's also going to be one of the most popular on the market. Some users have claimed it's too big to fit into their jeans without causing damage and others have gone as far as saying it can even bend if you sit down with it in your skinny jeans pocket. But now it turns out some fashion designers are prepared to bend themselves towards the iPhone. Scroll down for video . Top fashion brands are on the cusp of designing larger pockets for jeans in order to fit Apple's new iPhone range . The iPhone 6 Plus (left) and iPhone 6 (right) are considerably larger than previous designs . Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo recently told Quartz that the company was in talks about clothing comparability. '(The company is) having conversations currently with the product development team regarding technology overall, and how our clothes can provide compatibility from a user perspective. Jean pockets is one of those conversations,' they said. Five other brands told Mashable they were looking at re-engineering their pants around bigger phone handsets. At 5.5 inches the iPhone 6 Plus is fairly large compared to other smart phones on the market . Some users have claimed it's too big to fit into their jeans without causing damage and others have gone as far as saying it can even bend if you sit down with it in your skinny jeans pocket . 'Without being iPhone 6-specific, our mantra, like (Steve Jobs), will always be to design products that make people's lives a little better, Levi's Head of Global Design, Jonathan Cheung, said. Lee Jeans designer, Whitney Neary, said the company started talking about pocket size when the new iPhones were released, but they haven't committed to anything just yet. 'It's something that we always are considering, in terms of the functionality of our garments. Of course, we're always going to make sure that we're going for something that's flattering for the consumer,' she said. Apple's newest additions, which were released on September 19, are larger and lighter than the iPhone 5 (left) which was 4 inches, compared with the iPhone 6 Plus (right which is 5.5 inches . 'But we're always thinking about how she wears the garment, what occasion she's wearing the jeans for and what she needs to just make them work for her everyday life.' An American Eagle's spokesperson said 'Currently our men's pockets already accommodate the larger phones including the iPhone 6. Women's is still being evaluated'. 'Within certain product lines, such as our men's active apparel for instance, we do use iPhones and Samsung phones in our fit sessions to ensure that the pockets are large enough to accommodate these larger phones. The iPhone 6 would fit in the pockets now,' a spokesperson for L.L. Bean said. The iPhones went on sale on September 19 and those in Australia were among the first to get their hands of the new Apple products . The size of the handset didn't stop thousands from queuing for hours outside Apple stores around the world to be the first to get their hands on the new devices . J. Crew's head of women's design, Tom Mora, said the company tried to consider every aspect of a customer's life through the design process and phones 'is no exception'. 'We think about all of these details - whether it's introducing new tech accessories for the new iPhone 6 - or special interior pockets to carry the various generations of iPads or tablets,' he said. It comes after social media was abuzz with #bendgate when people claimed the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus could bend if you wore jeans or had it in your pocket for long periods.","Several fashion brands have indicated they are looking at re-engineering their jeans to fit bigger handsets like the iPhone 6 Plus .

"Victim: Melissa Bonney Ratcliff, 45, a one-time aide to former Vice President Al Gore, has been killed by an elderly motorist's out-of-control car in San Diego . Melissa Bonney Ratcliff, a one-time aide to Vice President Al Gore, has been killed by an elderly motorist's out-of-control car in San Diego. The coroner's office says the 45-year-old Ratcliff was struck by the Sedan, being driven by a 91-year-old woman, Tuesday afternoon as she got out of her vehicle in the La Jolla area. From 1999 to 2000, mother-of-three Ratcliff was deputy director of communications for Gore. She was also a press secretary for the Democratic National Committee. U-T San Diego reports  that Gore issued a statement saying Ratcliff was an integral part of the White House team. He said: 'Melissa was an integral part of our team in the White House. A loyal and dedicated colleague, her counsel, foresight and determination were indispensable. All of us who who worked with Melissa send condolences to her family.' A San Diego police spokesman told the newspaper the accident is under investigation but the driver could face vehicular manslaughter charges. Mrs Ratcliff was also an executive with the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. Jerry Sanders, the chamber president and chief executive officer, sent an email to chamber members today expressing 'great sadness' over Ratcliff's death.

"A woman was killed in a crash at a police roadside checkpoint while returning from a countryside picnic with her boyfriend. Melanie Lakin, 29, was riding her motorbike when she hit a stationary car at the roadside police checkpoint. An inquest heard boyfriend Oliver Dudley, 30, was following behind - and witnessed the fatal crash. Melanie Lakin, 29, was killed riding her motorbike, with her boyfriend, Oliver Dudley, 30, following behind . The couple were motorbike enthusiasts and were returning from a country picnic on the shore of Lake Bala . A police motorcyclist was carrying out routine checks and a cars were in a line of traffic waiting to be questioned by the officer. Dyfed Powys Police voluntarily referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) because a police vehicle was nearby at the time of the crash. But the IPCC ruled it was not a matter for them and Ms Lakin's death was being investigated by Dyfed-Powys Police. The inquest on Wednesday heard police inquiries are still continuing into the crash on the A458 near Welshpool and the hearing was adjourned until December. Ms Lakin, 29, a radiographer, hit a stationary car at the roadside police checkpoint on June 1 . The radiographer was riding her 600cc Yamaha Faser, which she called 'Bumblebee' because of its colours . Ms Lakin, a radiographer, and Mr Dudley, had  just enjoyed a picnic on the shore of Lake Bala and were returning home to the Midlands when the accident happened on June 1. Ms Lakin, from Tamworth, in Staffordshire, was riding her 600cc Yamaha Faser which she had nicknamed Bumblebee because of its striking black and yellow paintwork. An ambulance was called but she was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family said in a statement: 'Melanie was a keen motorcyclist who loved life, people, nature and animals especially her cats Hector and Cleo. 'She was kind, caring and generous and had just completed her first year in diagnostic radiography at Birmingham City University. 'Melanie was looking forward to a successful career in the NHS, combining her love of helping people and a technical, visual subject. 'She had a keen eye and appreciation for photography, music and art and managed to combine all three by photographing some of her favourite bands and musicians at music festivals.'","Melanie Lakin, 29, crashed her motorbike returning from a country picnic .

"The leaves are still on the trees and much of Britain is bathed in sunshine, yet the Co-op cannot wait for Christmas. The grocer is stocking ‘Luxury all butter mince pies’ some three months before Santa is expected to slip down the nation’s chimneys. The pies certainly look very tempting with the ‘Truly Irresistible’ brand packs presenting them as Christmas tree ornaments or fresh out of a gift box. Co-Op is stocking 'Luxury all butter mince pies' three months before Christmas . However, anyone thinking of stocking up on the festive favourite should beware about hanging on to them for festive parties, for the best before date is October 29. The early arrival of the mince pies provides yet further evidence of how retailers, particularly the big supermarkets, see special holidays like Christmas and Easter as key to their entire annual sales performance. The run up to Christmas and New Year accounts for more than 40per cent of annual sales and profits at the major grocers, so they are keen to extend the buying period for as long as possible. Shopper Sandra Thompson said she was 'shocked' to come across mince pies for sale, saying she would be 'sick of the sight of them' by Christmas . Shopper Sandra Thompson was looking for sun tan lotion - as she is about to go on a summer holiday to Spain - when she saw the mince pies on sale at a Co-op in Battersea. She said: ‘I was shocked to come across these mince pieces so early in the year. It’s still summertime for goodness sake. Christmas is months away. ‘I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw boxes of mince pies piled up in the shop. I’ll be sick of the sight of them by Christmas. And the irony is this lot won’t even last until Christmas. The Co-op said it has been putting two brands of mince pies in stores since early September, the ‘Loved by Us’ brand, priced at £1 per box, while the more upmarket ‘Truly Irresistible’ brand are £2 per box. A spokesman said this was part of a wider trend common across supermarkets to 'introduce a small number of popular Christmas lines at this time’. The spokesman added: ‘Our customers love them and whilst it may seem early to think about Christmas, especially with the unusually warm weather at the moment, we have seen a high demand for the mince pies. Indeed, sales are over 60 per cent up on the same time last year.’ Despite the good sales, the chain says it currently has no plans to stock them all year around.","Co-Op says sales of mince pies are up 60 per cent on last year .

"Tesco Bank is set to pay out £43million in compensation after a loan statement blunder left 175,000 customers out of pocket. The supermarket giant's banking arm has offered an apology to customers after a 'technical breach' meant they failed to send out personal loan and credit card statements. It is the latest in a string of errors to hit Britain's largest retailing group, currently under criminal investigating for 'cooking their books' - illegally overstating profits. Pay out: Tesco have made a £43million provision to reimburse customers illegally charged interest on loans . Online Tesco Bank has admitted the breach of industry rules and those who accrued interest on loans during that time must now be refunded - with the average payout £228. Last week, one customer received a cheque for £100 in the post, becoming the first person to receive compensation for the mistake - which breached the 1974 Consumer Credit Act. Another customer, Stuart Gibson, wrote on Twitter: 'Apparently Tesco bank forgot to send me an annual statement for five months on a loan I had. So they’ve sent me £450 instead. That’s nice.' Another, Steve Sharp, posted: 'Strange day as got a refund cheque from Tesco Bank for interest on a loan i had in 2011 cos they didnt send me an annual statement.' Under the Act, failure to provide prompt ‘post-contractual’ information is viewed as a statutory breach. An offending bank or building society is then obliged to refund any interest or charges that were incurred in the period between when the information should have been sent and when it actually went out. By failing to send prompt ‘post-contractual’ information to customers regarding their personal loan and credit card statements, Tesco bank breached the Consumer Credit Act. Customers accrued interest on loans without receiving any documentation on what they owed. Other banks and building societies are in the process of making similar refunds. In March, the Office of Fair Trading (now no more) confirmed that just short of 500,000 customers would be receiving £149 million from 17 unnamed financial institutions as a result of Consumer Credit Act violations. A Tesco spokesman said: 'As stated earlier in the year, we have put in place a redress programme to return interest and charges to customers who did not receive documentation in line with the requirements of the Consumer Credit Act. 'This redress programme has commenced and we are writing to all of those customers affected. Customers do not need to take any action however if they do have questions they can contact us as normal. 'It's not an incident of mis-selling. This is an industry-wide issue.' Other banks and building societies are in the process of making similar refunds. In March, the Office of Fair Trading confirmed that just short of 500,000 customers would be receiving £149 million from 17 unnamed financial institutions as a result of Consumer Credit Act violations. But for Tesco, the blunder is a fresh blow after it was recently plunged into crisis for 'over-stating' its profits. The group has formally been placed under criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) following its discovery of a £263 million black hole in profit expectations. Crisis: New Tesco boss Dave Lewis launched an inquiry into the supermarket's profit overstatement crisis last month . Following the allegations, eight of Tesco's executives have been suspended and last month the supermarket revealed its half-year profits had slumped 91 per cent to £112m. The bank has already set aside £240million for customers who were miss-sold payment protection insurance. September 22: Four executives at Tesco suspended after the supermarket giant admitted it overstated its profits guidance to the City by £250million. Shares dived to their lowest level in 11 years as the revelation triggered its third profits warning in as many months. September 23: Firm plunged into further crisis as it emerged the chain's sales had fallen at their fastest rate in more than 20 years. Figures showed total spending by shoppers over the past 12 weeks was down 4.5 per cent year on year - the worst trading fall seen by the retailer in more than two decades. October 1: Britain's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, started a full investigation into the company in the wake of the accounting scandal . October 2: Billionaire investor Warren Buffett conceded that his investment in Tesco was a ‘huge mistake’ October 7: Tesco asks a fifth senior executive, commercial director Kevin Grace, to step aside .

"Scientists have mapped the best positions for women suffering back pain to have sex. Despite the popular belief that 'spooning' is the best position for those suffering aches and pains, this new study dispels that theory. The researchers at the University of Waterloo in Canada found depending on the type of low-back pain a woman experienced, doggy style or the missionary position were the best to ease pain. Their findings - part of the first-ever study to document how the spine moves during sex - found 'spooning' was among the worst positions. A new study by scientists at the University of Waterloo in Canada documented exactly how the spine moves during sex. They found contrary to popular belief 'spooning' is not the best position for those with back pain . The new recommendations, published in the European Spine Journal, come after comparable guidelines for men were released last month. Natalie Sidorkewicz,  who led the study, said: 'Traditionally, spooning was recommended by physicians to all individuals with back pain because it was thought to reduce nerve tension and load on the tissues. 'But when we examined spine motion and muscle activity, we found that spooning can actually be one of the worst positions for certain types of back pain.' To compile their recommendations the team used pioneering research combining infra red and electromagnetic motion capture systems to track how 10 couples' spines moved while having sex in five common positions. The results were used to create an atlas, or illustrated set of guidelines, that can be used to recommend different sex positions based on what movements trigger a patient's pain. Last month, the same team revealed doggy-style is the best position for men suffering back pain. Those findings, published in the journal Spine, recommended men who were flexion-intolerant should replace spooning with doggy-style. They should also try a 'hip-hinging motion rather than thrusting with their spines', the authors said. The atlas suggests that women who are extension-intolerant - meaning their back pain is made worse by arching their backs or lying on their stomachs - should replace spooning with the missionary position. Adding a low-back support, such as a pillow, can also help keep the spine in a more neutral position. For those women who are flexion-intolerant - those whose back pain is made worse by touching their toes or sitting for long periods of time - the atlas recommends doggy-style, where the woman supports her upper body with her hands, not her elbows, or spooning. Ms Sidorkewicz said: 'What we know now is that sex positions that are suitable for one type of back pain are not appropriate for another kind of pain. 'These guidelines have the potential to improve quality of life - and love life - for many couples.' Four of every five people will experience at least one episode of disabling lower back pain in their lifetime, according to statistics. Up to 84 per cent of men with low-back pain and 73 per cent of women report a significant decrease in the frequency of sex when suffering back pain. The findings recommend women suffering low-back pain made worse by arching the back or lying on their stomach should opt for the missionary position, while those with pain aggravated by touching their toes or sitting for long periods of time, should have sex 'doggy-style' Professor Stuart McGill, of the Faculty of Applied Health Sciences at Waterloo, added: 'Primary care physicians report it is common for couples to seek their advice regarding how to manage their back pain during and after sex. 'Many couples will remain celibate because the pain resulting from one night of lovemaking lasts months. Now doctors have solid science to guide their recommendations.' He said the next phase of the study will involve recruiting patients with different categories of back and hip pain, as well as additional sex positions, to further develop the recommendations. Last month the team revealed doggy-style is the best position for men suffering back pain. Those findings, published in the journal Spine, recommended men who were flexion-intolerant should replace spooning with doggy-style. They should also try a 'hip-hinging motion rather than thrusting with their spines', the authors said.","Scientists at the University of Waterloo in Canada conducted first comprehensive study of how the spine moves during sex .

"Branislav Ivanovic has revealed how Jose Mourinho tore into his Chelsea players in Slovenia and admits a repeat of the performance will result in disappointment at Liverpool. Mourinho was furious with what he saw during a goalless first 45 minutes in the Champions League against Maribor. He hauled off Andre Schurrle and Willian during the break and accused his team of being 'very slow' and lacking 'intensity' and 'creativity'. 'He was not happy and at half-time he showed it,' said Ivanovic. 'He told us exactly what he wanted in the second-half. We tried to play more offensive. He wanted to win the game and we tried to do that. Jose Mourinho was left fuming after Chelsea's 'slow' first-half performance in Maribor on Wednesday . Branislav Ivanovic (second right), seen high-fiving Nemanja Matic after his equalising goal, revealed Mourinho tore into his players during his half-time team talk . Matic equalised for Chelsea after 73 minutes but they were unable to push on and win the match in Slovenia . 'For us, it was a massive game. It was very important and we didn’t win. It is a reminder. We know how our performance has to be to get the points. If we play like that against Liverpool, we know it’s not possible to win.' Maribor took the lead early in the second half through Agim Ibraimi before Nemanja Matic equalised and Chelsea summoned a desperate finish. Eden Hazard missed a penalty five minutes from time and Diego Costa had a goal ruled out for offside. It was close. Mourinho was convinced it was onside and was criticised Italian referee Daniele Orsato, but Ivanovic said: 'We didn’t perform how we know. In the end, with the penalty, we should have won. To be honest, maybe we didn’t deserve to win. Mourinho was not impressed by Chelsea's poor start to the game and let his players know at half-time . Mourinho - and Didier Drogba - were not impressed by referee Daniele Orsato . 'We didn’t have enough stability in our game. When we conceded the game changed and we changed the shape, playing three at the back with more risk and we scored a goal. 'When you change the shape, you always have the risk of conceding a goal and that’s why in the second half we didn’t look how we normally do. We cannot be relaxed and we have to learn from every game. 'Every time when we come into the game relaxed and not play for 90 minutes we are struggling with results. So we have to be smart in that part and we have to play every game, 90 minutes.' Chelsea are still strong favourites to qualify from Group G . Diego Costa had a late goal ruled out for offside as Chelsea pushed forward in search of a winner . Despite dropping points, Chelsea are in a healthy position. They are top of the Barclays Premier League and travel to Liverpool on Saturday.

"Georgia Sigourney, 12, has been left with horrific scars after her face was brutally mauled by a friend's Siberian Husky . A 12-year-old girl has been left with horrific scars and narrowly avoided being blinded after her face was brutally mauled by a friend's new Siberian Husky. Georgia Sigourney was lying on the floor at her friend's house watching X Factor when she accidentally nudged the dog, causing it to tear the flesh around her mouth and cheeks. The schoolgirl ran screaming in tears with blood pouring down her face from the house in Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, after the animal attacked. Her father Chris, 34, said: 'It's horrendous, I was absolutely devastated. She's very upset and scared of dogs now. She's really nervous. 'It's just started to sink in. She's a pretty girl and she's obviously worried how she's going to look. 'If it was just a bit lower down it could have killed her or if it was a bit higher up she could have been blinded. 'It is horrible to say but she is lucky to have it where it is. She really is lucky to be alive when you think about it.' He said that Georgia was sitting on the floor with the dog asleep behind her. She then stood up and nudged the dog, which suddenly flipped and clamped its jaw down on her face. Mr Sigourney said: 'She screamed and screamed. Her friend just locked herself in the bathroom so she was alone with the dog.' Georgia was rushed to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, where she was put on a drip and given 31 external stitches and 20 internally. She is finding it difficult to eat because of the pain of opening her mouth and has to drink through a straw. She was sat on the floor at her friend's home when she accidentally nudged the dog, causing it to lunge at her face and tear the flesh around her mouth and cheeks . This is believed to be the dog that attacked Georgia. A member of her friend's family posted this picture of the Siberian Husky, saying: 'We got a new dog today, love her' 'It's ruined her life. This is going to haunt her for the rest of her life even if she was really brave at the time,' said Mr Sigourney. 'I want to say thank you to the doctors because they pretty much pieced her face back together. Police have now seized the dog, which apparently belonged to a friend of the family who lived at the house where the attack happened. Mr Sigourney said his daughter's friend had posted on Facebook that day saying 'this is our new dog Dakota'. 'But now they are claiming it's not their dog and have given it to police to destroy,' he added. 'They only live two minutes down the street. My daughter said she and her friend had been left alone in the house for two hours.' Georgia's father Chris (left) said his daughter, pictured with her brother Callum, is lucky to be alive . 'We have two dogs of our own and Georgia knows how to behave around animals. She's never been involved in an incident before. 'We are just leaving the police to deal with it. I just want to warn other people to be careful. Do not leave your dogs alone with children because they can get hurt.' A spokeswoman for Cambridgeshire Police said: 'The dog has been seized by police. 'We are awaiting advice from the dangerous dogs officer as to what should happen to it.' The family who owned the dog refused to comment on the incident.","Georgia Sigourney, 12, needed 50 stitches after her face was mauled by dog .

"The Hollywood cast of the new Dad's Army film have been spotted out on manoeuvres as they begin shooting the movie remake of the classic comedy series. Stars including  Michael Gambon, Daniel Mays and Toby Jones were seen in their Home Guard uniforms after they began making the new film in the Yorkshire countryside. There was criticism of the film's world-famous cast when it was announced last month, with fans of the original saying big-money stars and expensive production would ruin the memory of the much-loved comedy. But producer Damian Jones insists the remake will remain faithful to the original and pictures of the set appear to show the look of the new film is similar to TV series. Scroll down for video . The Hollywood stars remaking Dad's Army have been pictured in their Home Guard uniforms for the first time. Toby Jones (left) was spotted as Captain Mainwaring - originally played by Arthur Lowe (right) - during a shoot in the Yorkshire countryside this week .

Inbetweeners actor Blake Harrison (left) chats to a member of crew on set. He is playing Pike, the character made famous by Ian Lavender (right), who is one of the few members of the original cast who is still alive . Photos taken in Yorkshire show Sir Michael Gambon - best known for playing Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films - getting used to his new role as frail medic Godfrey. Bill Nighy - famous for starring in Love Actually - is meanwhile  playing Sergeant Wilson, the aristocratic but charming second in command to Captain Mainwaring. Mainwaring himself, the character brought to life by Arthur Lowe in the original, is now being played by Toby Jones, who recently starred in blockbuster The Hunger Games. The pictures show the Home Guard soldiers dressed in various forms of camouflage for an apparent exercise in the countryside. Walker, now played by Daniel Mays, wears a strange leafy head-dress, while Private Pike, originally played by Ian Lavender but now by Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison, appears to be dressed in a sack.

Catherine Zeta-Jones - who is set to play a new character, a journalist who sends pulses racing when she is sent to Walmington-on-Sea to write about the unit - was also spotted on set. Despite being given only 13 weeks when it was first aired in 1968, Dad's Army ran for 11 years and became one of the nation's favourite comedies, attracting 18million viewers at its height. Scripts originally written by David Croft and Jimmy Perry made famous catchphrases such as 'you stupid boy', 'put that light out' and 'they don't like it up 'em'.

"Nearly three-quarters of American adults who use the Internet have witnessed online harassment, while 40 per cent have experienced it themselves, according to a new first-of-its-kind report. Young adults, aged 18 to 29, were the most likely age group to see and undergo online harassment. Women aged 18 to 24 were disproportionately the victims of stalking and sexual harassment, according to the survey by Pew Research Center. Women aged 18 to 24 were more likely to be the victims of stalking and sexual harassment online according to the survey (stock image posed by models) The types of harassment Pew asked about range from name-calling to physical threats, sexual harassment and stalking. Half of those who were harassed said they didn't know the person who had most recently attacked them. When asked to describe their experience of harassment, respondents referred to social media in their answers. Graph showing age groups of Internet users being harassed on different web locations . 'I was harassed and threatened through messages and comments on my Facebook page', one wrote. 'I had someone use Facebook to try to spread nasty rumors about me', another wrote. Although women were found to be the victim of stalking and sexual harassment more often, men were more likely to be called offensive names than women. Graph showing harassment on social media, online gaming and comments section of websites . Of all Internet users (89 per cent of the U.S. population), 32 percent of men and 22 percent of women were called names. Men were also more likely to be physically threatened. People who have more information available about them online, and those who work in the tech industry and promote themselves online, were also more likely to be harassed on the Internet. Thirty-eight percent of people who were harassed online said a stranger was behind the threats, and another 26 percent didn't know who the person was. Two-thirds of those who were harassed said the most recent incident took place on a social networking site or app, while 22 percent saw it happen in the comments section of a website. Meanwhile, 16 per cent said it happened in online gaming. Just five per cent of those who were harassed reported the incident to law enforcement, while nearly half confronted the person online. Just under half (44 per cent)  said they un-friended or blocked the person. Not everyone said they were hurt by online harassment but 14 per cent of people found their most recent incident 'extremely upsetting,' and 22 percent said it was 'not at all upsetting.' The rest of the people surveyed had reactions in between. The telephone and online survey was conducted between May 30 and June 30 2014 among 3,217 respondents.

"James Norton's acting career has recently seen a complete turnaround. Having played the psychopathic killer Tommy Lee Royce in the BBC series Happy Valley, his latest project has seen him take on a more angelic role. James has recently been filming the new series of Granchester where he plays the troubled Reverend Sidney Chambers. James Norton, who played the psychopathic killer Tommy Lee Royce in the BBC series Happy Valley, looks cool and casual as he poses for Marks and Spencer's online magazine . In his interview with Marks and Spencer's online magazine, James admits that his recent change in character has confused some of his fans. He said: 'The funniest is when people see me in a dog collar, when the public gather on set when we're filming Grantchester, and you can see them looking at me, and trying to process this memory of a psychopath now wearing a dog collar and trying to marry the two together.' Playing the local vicar should come as a welcome relief to the 29-year-old actor, who says that his role in Happy Valleys occasionally took its toll. James explained that getting into character was something that required a great amount of investment from him. 'Getting into the mindset of a guy like Tommy, who I played in Happy Valley, it's a lot of work. I was put in touch with a psychologist and watched lots of films, and you have to try and empathise as much as you can with his position.' Making a name for himself in the acting industry is something that is really important to James, who has spent his life trying to prove himself as a thespian, he reveals in the candid interview . James, who looks dapper in a series of suits from M&S, explained that getting into character was something that required a great amount of investment from him . He says that although his part was testing, the experience taught him a lot about the human psyche and he even began to sympathise with Tommy. 'I think the mistake lots of people make when it comes to a psychopath is that they completely write off their actions as cruel, callous and completely calculated but actually the truth is that they have interests and reasons behind their actions. 'They commit these acts of brutal murder and cruelty in order to survive, because they see the world as inherently hostile and if they don't attack, the world will attack them.' James' understanding of the role hadn't always been so well educated and he explained that perhaps his desperation to play Tommy showed in his first audition, where he admits to coming across as a little try-hard. 'I was desperate to show them that I could play a ruthless psychopath, so I turned up at the read-through with these big black boots on and a trench coat and sat by the tea table, and didn't look or speak to anyone. I just tried to be really enigmatic and dark and sinister and then, eventually, of course, they found out.' He revealed that he really admires Richard Wilson, who played Victor Meldrew in One Foot in the Grave. 'He's become a mentor,' he said of the actor . James reveals that he is a huge fan of clothes, and loves M&S. 'All my underwear is M&S,' he shared as he poses in trunks by a pool . Before his stint as a kidnapper, James took on several other television and film roles and even appeared in Doctor Who, but Happy Valleys was easily his big break. Making a name for himself in the acting industry is something that is really important to James who has spent his life trying to prove himself as a thespian. James says that he has always had extremely supportive parents, with his father even appearing as an extra in several productions, but the British actor admits that not everyone is as understanding when it comes to pursuing a career in the arts. 'It takes a lot of courage, when everyone is asking you what you want to do, if you say that you want to be a musician or an actor, people can be very condescending and say, ""oh, that's so sweet, good luck with that!"" It can be very frustrating. 'I think that's one of the most important things about studying drama at an institution, you go, ""I am now a professional."" I can say that to people and I don't care if they're condescending because I know that this is my life and this is what I've dedicated those three years to.' James says that he has always had extremely supportive parents, with his father even appearing as an extra in several productions . The actor explains that he had the acting bug from a very early age and loved storytelling as a child . Despite his success, James has his head screwed on and remains humble. 'I've been pretty lucky, the last few years with Happy Valley and then Grantchester have been very special, so I'm waiting for that duff job or the diva-ish cast or aggressive director!' It's no wonder he's loving every minute; James, who admires Richard Wilson, says that he had the acting bug from a very early age and was always the kid who loved telling stories, putting them on as theatre and then insisting that his parents and all their friends would sit down and watch them. 'I grew up in the countryside so I had quite a feral life up until the age of about fourteen,' he recalls. 'I had the safety of that environment so I was able to run wild and let loose. It was totally idyllic, like an Eden that was mine with no dangers or threats. And then at the age of fifteen, I realised there was a party going on elsewhere that I wasn't invited to, and suddenly the Eden-like paradise of the countryside felt incredibly limiting - I became very oppressive and adolescent, and then was a nightmare for the rest of my teenage years.' Today, he is loving every minute of his acting career and feels blessed to be among so much British talent. 'As far as people I'd like to work with, the list is endless,' he says. 'I think to work with Steve McQueen would be amazing, and then some of the UK talent we have; Eddie Marsan, Olivia Colman, both of whom I have met and admired for a long time. We're very blessed in this country, there is so much talent for people to work with and learn from.' Like what James is wearing? You can find the looks from his shoot on the M&S website.

"A sleeping couple in a Denver suburb were jolted awake by the sound of their car horn at 3am on Monday and called 911 fearing their car was being stolen. Instead they found a black bear sitting behind the wheel. The smarter-than-average bear had managed to open the unlocked door attracted by the smell of food the couple had left, but managed to lock himself in and started frantically flailing around, setting off the car horn. When wildlife services arrived to the Castle Pines North, Douglas County home, they simply opened the door and let the agitated bear run away, leaving behind damage to the tune of $15,000.' Scroll Down for Video . 'I am in!' The bear was photographed by the Douglas County Sheriff's Office stuck inside the couple's car after letting himself in through an unlocked door . 'Our bears are really smart,' said Jennifer Churchill, a public information officer for Colorado Parks and Wildlife. 'If the door’s not locked and it’s one of those lift-latch doors they can get in there.' Churchill told Fox 31 that in future, the couple will take care to not only lock their car door but not leave food sitting inside - especially as it has cost them a small fortune. 'For the most part, when animals are trapped like that, I think they can get pretty stressed out and agitated,' said Churchill. 'Just like we would.' 'Where to?' The couple were woken up by the sound of their car horn and thought their car was being stolen. It wasn't . Temper: The black bear became agitated inside the SUV and caused $15,000 worth of damage trying to get out . Despite the mildly comical nature of the bear break-in, Churchill said she doubts the bear will ever come back. 'A few years ago in Highlands Ranch, a bear got into a car, flipped the emergency break and rolled all the way down a hill in the car,' said Churchill to Fox 31. 'It was still locked in when our officer came to get it out. 'I don’t think we’ve ever heard from that bear in Highlands Ranch again,' said Churchill. 'I think he took off like a shot.' Parks and Wildlife in Denver also took the opportunity to remind the public to be especially vigilant now with their property, because of bears looking for food. 'It’s important to keep in mind that this is the time of year,' said Churchill to Fox 31. 'Hyperfasia is when the bears need to eat like 10,000 calories a day, in order to pack on pounds to get through their hibernation during the winter.' Obstacle: In San Jose, David Tang was woken by the sound of his car alarm and checked his surveillance cameras and saw this mountain lion. The date is incorrect because Mr. Tang has never set it to the correct one . The mountain lion checked out Mr. Tang's car, but failed to find a way inside the inviting car . And in San Jose, California, on Tuesday, a man was startled awake by the sound of his car alarm, only to check his home surveillance footage to find a mountain lion had set it off by climbing on the roof. David Tang was woken at 2.50am, but thought nothing of it, assumming a passer-by had caused the alarm to go off. 'I didn’t expect that,' he said to the LA Times after reviewing the footage. 'I thought someone passed by.' Tang also passed on the video to his neighbors to warn them to beware over the coming days. 'People walk around here at night time and walk with their dogs, so it's dangerous for the people if they don't know,' said Tang to ABC News. While Tang's neighbors said they think the big cat came out of Almaden County Quicksilver Park, they have only ever seen Coyotes and wild boar.","Black bear opened unlocked door to find food left inside the SUV .

"Orbital Sciences says it will 'likely' stop using the type of engines that were employed when its unmanned Antares commercial supply rocket bound for the International Space Station exploded moments after liftoff last week. The company says its investigation of the crash is continuing, but preliminary results point to a failure in one of its two main engines involved in the first stage of launch. 'As a result, the use of these engines for the Antares vehicle likely will be discontinued,' it said. The Orbital Sciences Corporation Antares rocket, with the Cygnus spacecraft onboard, explodes moments Preliminary results from the investigation point to a failure in one of its two main engines . The Antares rocket was due to launch an unmanned Orbital-3 Cygnus spacecraft to deliver more than 5,000lbs of supplies to the International Space Station - including science experiments, experiment hardware, spare parts, and crew provisions - as part of a $1.9billion deal with NASA. Outfitted with a new, more powerful upper-stage engine, the Antares rocket was packed with 5,055 pounds (2,293 kg) of supplies, science experiments and equipment, a 15 percent increase over previous missions. Orbital says it still plans to fulfill its contract with NASA to deliver all remaining cargo to the Space Station by the end of 2016. 'Orbital is taking decisive action to fulfill our commitments to NASA in support of safe and productive operations of the Space Station,' David Thompson, Orbital's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said. 'While last week's Antares failure was very disappointing to all of us, the company is already implementing a contingency plan to overcome this setback. 'We intend to move forward safely but also expeditiously to put our CRS cargo program back on track and to accelerate the introduction of our upgraded Antares rocket.' The engines involved are liquid oxygen and kerosene-fueled AJ26 engines made by Aerojet Rocketdyne. The engines were originally designed and produced during the Soviet era in Russia, though modifications have been made. On its website, Orbital said each AJ26 engine was sent from the Aerojet Rocketdyne facility in Sacramento, California, to the NASA/Stennis Space Center in Mississippi for hot fire acceptance testing, prior to heading to the Wallops Island, Virginia, launch site. The investigation is focusing on fact the Antares rocket that blew up on the launchpad on its way to the International Space Station last night was using a 40-year-old Russian engine of a similar design to those used during the Soviets' disastrous attempts to beat America to the moon in the 1960s, it has emerged. Old technology: The engines in question are of a similar design to those used to power Russia's ill-fated N1 series rockets which the Soviets hoped to use to beat America to the moon in the 1960s . Dulles-based Orbital Sciences, which has a $1.9 billion contract to make eight supply missions to the international space station, purchased a number of the engines which had been mothballed by Russia in the 1970s, the Washington Post reports. 'They were in fact built in Russia about 40 years ago and stored in plastic bags after their Moon program was cancelled,' Jonathan McDowell, of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told NPR. Earlier incarnations of the engines had been designed to power Russia's enormous N1 rockets into orbit - however all four launches of the N1, which took place between 1969 and 1972, failed, leading the Soviet space programme to abandon attempts to put a cosmonaut on the moon. However, the Russian maker of the engine denied its product was at fault for the catastrophe. The Kuznetsov company in the Russian city of Samara suggested that modifications carried out in the US could be to blame, the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported. 'Due to certain specifics, it's not possible to talk about the construction details of the rocket itself and the interaction of its systems during launch, since this is the field of American specialists,' Kuznetsov's press service said, according the The Guardian. 'However, it's important to note that during yesterday's launch, the AJ-26 first-stage engines, which are a modification of the NK-33, were functioning normally.' 'While the work of the AIB continues, preliminary evidence and analysis conducted to date points to a probable turbopump-related failure in one of the two Aerojet Rocketdyne AJ26 stage one main engines,' Orbital said. Dulles-based Orbital Sciences, which has a $1.9 billion contract to make eight supply missions to the international space station, purchased a number of the engines which had been mothballed by Russia in the 1970s, the Washington Post reports.

It will introduce an already-planned upgrade to the Antares propulsion system early in 2016. Orbital Sciences Corp., based in Dulles, Virginia, says there will be no cost increase for NASA and it doesn't expect costs related to the accident to be material for Orbital in 2015. Shares of Orbital Sciences rose $1.06, or 4.2 percent, to $26.18 in morning trading Wednesday.

"The residents of a Welsh village feared they would not be buried alongside their ancestors after a historic graveyard was put up for sale as a domestic garden. However, a generous farmer and his wife have now stepped in and saved the cemetery - ensuring that future generations of local families will be laid to rest together. Vince and Elaine Stephens are believed to have spent as much as £100,000 buying the land, which is attached to a disused Protestant chapel in the village of Talgarth, near the Brecon Beacons. Saved: This graveyard in the Welsh village of Talgarth has been bought by a local farmer . Disused: The Bethania United Reform Church has not been used as a Protestant chapel since 2009 . The Bethania United Reform Church was put up for sale earlier this year, after falling into disuse around 2009 when a new church was set up elsewhere in the village. In the prospectus for the property, prospective buyers were told that although they would have to maintain the graveyard there was no obligation to allow new burials there. Mr Stephens, 59, whose parents are buried in the cemetery, decided that he should buy it so that villagers could be buried in the same place as their relatives for decades to come. He and his wife negotiated with the trustees of the chapel to split off the graveyard and buy it separately, for a price believed to be around £100,000. 'The graveyard is an essential part of our community,' Mrs Stephens said. 'My husband's parents are both buried there and he went to Sunday school in the chapel. 'It is an important place for villagers, just about everyone here has someone who is buried there.' Threat: The graveyard was going to be sold to the new owners of the chapel, who would not have had to allow new burials there . The couple have now put the cemetery into a trust which will ensure that it remains available for the use of the local community. 'The chapel has been closed for a few years and up until we bought it, the graveyard has been closed since July,' Mrs Stephens added. 'We are very pleased to have secured it on behalf of the local people. 'We've had a wonderful reaction from the village. We've had phone calls, cards and been stopped in the street. Everyone is very grateful.' Mr Stephens, a dairy farmer, said: 'We are pleased with the way it's turned out but we don't want to make a big fuss. 'It means there could be more burials there so people can be laid to rest with their loved ones. It's a family graveyard.' Trust: Vince and Elaine Stephens have guaranteed the future of the graveyard for decades to come . However, Mr and Mrs Stephens have not yet decided whether or not they will be buried in their own graveyard, as they are regulars at a church elsewhere. Suzanne Cole, property officer for the United Reformed Church National synod of Wales, said: 'We are pleased to confirm that a local farming family have set up a trust which has purchased the burial ground. 'The declared objects of the group are to manage the land - primarily as a private burial ground.' The chapel, which was originally founded in the early 19th century and rebuilt in 1891, is being sold at auction with a guide price of £80,000. It is set to be converted into a four-bedroom family home - but the graveyard will no longer be part of the property.","Bethania United Reform Church in Talgarth, Wales was put up for auction .

"Just days before Ohio inmate Dwayne Wilson was to be released from prison he was charged with 14 new counts of rape and kidnapping following cold-case DNA testing. The 54-year-old has now been ordered to remain in custody, after thousands of previously untested rape kits linked him to the rapes of four adults and one teenager over a three-year period. Wilson, who was indicted by a Cuyahoga County grand jury last week, was otherwise scheduled to be released on Friday after serving five years in jail for sexual assault. Ohio inmate Dwayne Wilson was due for release on Friday before cold-case DNA testing linked him to a string of rape and kidnapping offences that involved attacks on victims aged 16 to 34 . In the five newly discovered attacks, prosecutors say Wilson pulled up to his victims in his vehicle before sexually assaulting them at either knifepoint or gunpoint. The victims were aged 16 to 34. State Attorney General Mike DeWine said Wilson's dark past was unearthed among 5,023 rape kits that have been tested since October 1. From that batch, there have been 1,861 hits to DNA already in the Combined DNA Index System, authorities said. Mr Dewine said Wilson's case highlights 'exactly why' the thousands of previously untested rape kits needed to be looked at. In the five newly discovered attacks, prosecutors say Wilson pulled up to his victims in his vehicle before sexually assaulting them at either knifepoint or gunpoint . He said: 'Had these kits not been tested, this defendant would have been released from prison and given the opportunity to attack again. Now he's looking at spending the rest of his life behind bars.' Mr DeWine said he's told law enforcement to send him previously untested kits for testing, free of charge. Cuyahoga County Assistant Prosecutor Rick Bell, who heads the DNA Cold Case Task Force, praised the testing project as a monumental step in the right direction. He said: 'We have learned that serial offenders like Wilson simply will not stop committing sexual assaults. 'By pursuing these indictments and keeping Wilson behind bars, we can not only obtain justice for these five victims, we can ensure that no other women will have to suffer at the hands of this vile cretin.'","Sex offender Dwayne Wilson was meant to be released from jail on Friday .

"A number of meteors created by the remnants of Halley's Comet have been snapped streaking over Britain's skies. The famous comet was last seen in 1986 and is not due to brighten the Earth skies until 2061, as it appears once every 75 years. But each year in mid-to-late October, Earth passes through the comet's dusty debris, and the pre-dawn sky can light up with a stunning display of shooting stars. Scroll down for video . Wayne Perry from Plymouth told MailOnline that this was just the second attempt at photographing a meteor shower. He waited in a field in Princetown, just outside Plymouth, from between midnight to 1am this morning to take this image using a Nikon d7100 . John Maclean of Exeter Meteor Detection system in Devon was able to capture the phenomenon above Exeter last night. 'As the Earth moves through this dust in its orbit, we see meteors in a shower named the Orionids, because they seem to radiate from the constellation of Orion,' said Mr Maclean. His image of a fireball was captured at 5:44am on Wednesday morning. 'I wonder if my neighbour realised what was heading for his house!' Mr Maclean said. John Maclean of Exeter Meteor Detection system in Devon captured the phenomenon above Exeter during a meteor shower. The spectacular show was the result of Earth's encounter with the remnants of the tail of Halley's Comet which last passed the planet in 1986 and left behind a trail of dust . When rock particles break away from the comet and pass through the Earth's upper atmosphere, it appears that the sky is full of 'falling stars'. The meteors are known as 'Orionids' because they seem to fan out from a region to the north of the constellation Orion's second brightest star, Betelgeuse. Comet of origin: 1P/Halley . Radiant: Just to the north of constellation Orion's bright star Betelgeuse . Active: 2 Oct. - 7 Nov. 2014 . Peak activity: 21-22 Oct. 2014 . Peak activity meteor count: Approximately 20 meteors per hour in moonless skies. Meteor velocity: 66 km (41 miles) per second . Another image was taken by Wayne Perry from Plymouth who told MailOnline that this was just the second attempt at photographing a meteor shower. He waited in a field in Princetown, just outside Plymouth, from between midnight to 1am this morning to take the images using a Nikon d7100. 'It would be absolutely beautiful for a little while and then the cloud came over and covered it,' he said. 'I was obviously on my own, but when I saw it, I just shouted out ""Whooaa!"" It was amazing.' The Orionid meteor shower is not the strongest, but it is one of the most beautiful showers of the year, according to Bill Cooke, the head of Nasa Meteoroid Environment Office. Sky watchers may also be able to catch the shower between midnight and dawn on 22 October. This image was taken by Wayne Perry in Plymouth as he was waiting for the meteor shower earlier this morning . This is because shower is framed by some of the brightest stars in the heavens. Constellations such as Taurus, Gemini and Orion provide a glittering backdrop for the display. The brightest star of all, Sirius, is located just below Orion's left foot. The comets rained down between midnight and dawn this morning with as many as 25 meteors appearing each hour. Sky watchers may also be able to catch the shower again between midnight and dawn on 22 October. People living in North America, Europe, most parts of Asia, and northern parts of South America will be able to see the meteor shower by looking towards the south-eastern sky. Those who live in the southern hemisphere can see see the shower by looking to the north eastern sky. Pictured is a Orionid meteor captured by a Nasa all sky meteor camera located in southern Arizona in the pre-dawn hours of October 12. Those who live in the southern hemisphere will be able to see the shower tonight by looking to the north eastern sky .","Meteors were created by remnants of Halley's Comet last seen in 1986 .

"A conservationist embroiled in a multi-million pound court battle with her estranged husband over funds from the charity they set up with the aim of saving endangered Chinese tigers had become 'blinded by her desire for revenge', a judge has said. Sir Paul Coleridge, sitting in the Family Division of the High Court in London, said that desire had led Li Quan - a 'very intelligent person' - to 'fabricate where she thinks it will assist her case'. The judge was giving his findings in a round of a legal fight between Ms Li, a Chinese conservationist, and former banker Stuart Bray - who are both in their 50s and live in London, which followed the collapse of their marriage. Ms Li told the judge during proceedings earlier this year that money put into the Save China's Tigers charity was used to fund their personal lives. Li Quan claimed that money put into the Save China's Tigers charity was used to fund the personal lives of her and her husband former banker Stuart Bray. A divorce judge said she was 'blinded by her desire for revenge' The judge said Li Quan was 'passionate' about not only saving the Chinese tiger from 'disappearing from the planet altogether' Mr Bray, who comes from America and used to work for Deutsche Bank, hotly disputed her case that a trust was established not only to advance the cause of the tigers, but also to provide financial benefit and support for the husband and wife personally over the long term. In a written ruling, Sir Paul said today that there was 'no evidence of past, present or future benefit to the parties'. He said the trust has assets 'which are worth tens of millions of dollars or pounds'. The precise figure 'is far from agreed, but on the most optimistic view not more than £25m, but there are now almost no assets, relatively speaking, outside it'. The judge added: 'Accordingly, the determination of this preliminary issue necessarily has a profound impact on the wife's claim.' The couple lived together from 1997, marrying in 2001. In 2000 Ms Li established Save China's Tigers in the UK. File picture . Giving the background to the case, the judge said the wife was 'passionate' about not only saving the Chinese tiger from 'disappearing from the planet altogether', but also breeding them for reintroduction into wild reserves in China - the Chinese tiger (panthera tigris amoyensis) no longer exists in the wild. He added: 'To that end she has invested huge amounts of time and energy and some money.' She met Mr Bray in 1990 and 'he too, over time, became infected with the same passion for the cause of saving the Chinese tiger'. The judge said: 'And he too has invested even greater sums of money in the venture, loosely and frequently described as the Chinese Tiger Project, and a great deal of his time and energy.' The couple lived together from 1997, marrying in 2001. In 2000 Ms Li established Save China's Tigers in the UK (SCT UK), which secured UK Charity Commission registration the following year. 'Between that time and July 2012 the husband and wife worked tirelessly and more or less cooperatively on this patently bold, imaginative, charitable and laudable venture', said the judge. Sir Paul continued: 'The wife's expertise in the field of tiger conservation and her Chinese contacts and cultural background combined with the husband's profound understanding of, and experience in, complicated international finance and financial structures undoubtedly produced a dynamic partnership.' But he said: 'Tragically for all involved the personal relationship of the wife and husband deteriorated over time. Part of the problem seems to have been disagreements over the future policy and precise presentation of the project.' Sir Paul said that in July 2012 the wife was removed as director of SCT UK and the following month filed a divorce petition. He said: 'From the word go the wife has been beside herself with grief and anger at the way that she has been unjustifiably, as she sees it, removed from SCT UK and the Tiger project which she has always seen as 'her baby'. 'She has gone as far as saying that if she cannot lead the project she would rather it was destroyed. 'She has since her departure set up another charity with similar objectives and which the husband believes is an attempt to try and usurp SCT UK's function.' The judge said he was 'driven' to find 'overall' that 'she is an unreliable witness upon whom the court cannot rely'. That was 'especially so' when it came to deciding where the 'truth lies' about the underlying purpose of the trust 'and any discussion which took place at the time of its creation'. Sir Paul said: 'The wife is a very intelligent person but she has become blinded by her desire for revenge and this has led her to fabricate where she thinks it will assist her case.' He said that in contrast, he found the husband's evidence 'bore all conventional hallmarks of honesty and accuracy'. In a statement issued after the decision, Ms Li said: 'I am surprised and disappointed by the now retired judge's decision. 'I want to ask the Court of Appeal to right this wrong. 'It is a terrible precedent. However as there will probably be an appeal, I am advised that it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further at this time.'","Li Quan is embroiled in divorce with former banker Stuart Bray .

"A cruel or thoughtless comment about a woman's size can stay with her for life, let alone one made at a particularly vulnerable time such as in the bedroom. But one woman has turned a crushing comment by her then boyfriend into an incentive to get fit and lose an incredible 13st. Paige Way, 22, who once weighed 23st, was left humiliated when her boyfriend told her her stomach was getting in the way of love making during a romantic getaway to celebrate their one-year anniversary. Paige managed to turn the cruel comment about the size of her stomach into motivation to change her life for the better, transforming herself from a size 28 to a size 12 . Despite being hurt, Paige was prompted to embark on a diet that has seen her drop an amazing eight dress sizes from a size 28 to size 12. Paige, from Sydenham, South East London, said: 'It was absolutely mortifying when my boyfriend told me that my belly was getting in the way, but it gave me the push I needed to finally do something about my weight. 'I'd always been big as a child, and then I was 'the fat one' in my bunch of friends. Men would say horrible things about me on nights out, like 'God, look at the size of her.' 'I had no confidence whatsoever, but I tried to kid myself that I was happy being fat. 'Even when I broke a sun lounger at a family barbecue by sitting on it, I just laughed it off. Paige originally lost 8st on a juice diet but after suffering detrimental health effects switched to a more sustainable healthy eating plan and lost a further 5st,  in total dropping from 23st (left) to 10st (right) 'However, when my boyfriend made that comment, I knew I couldn't kid myself any longer.' Office worker Paige had spent years gorging on shop-bought sandwiches, biscuits and chocolate. A regular visitor to McDonald's, she would eat two burger meals and fries, followed by a McFlurry and a large milkshake. And during the day, she would guzzle a 2-litre bottle of full-fat Coke. By the age of 21, her weight had soared to 23st and her BMI was a dangerous 57 - nearly three times the recommended range of 18.5 to 25. Paige Way, aged 7, (left) with her little sister Darcy (right) says she was always the 'fat one' out of her friends . In March 2013, doctors diagnosed 5ft 3in Paige as morbidly obese and told her she was at risk of having a heart attack. They also warned her that if she didn't ditch the fizzy drinks, her teeth would fall out. Paige said: 'I was absolutely mortified. Deep down I knew that my health was suffering because of my weight, but I'd always tried to deny it. 'I was constantly tired and short of breath. If I was walking for the bus, I'd have to stop for a break. And my feet were covered in massive blisters from the pressure of carrying my body around. 'By the time I got to work, I was dripping in sweat and my makeup was running off my face. It was horrible.' Her diet has totally changed, having ditched the fast food and fizz and adopted a diet of fresh healthy foods . In July 2013, Paige decided to finally do something about her size. She ended her relationship and embarked on a diet that has seen her more than halve her body weight. Initially, she began a juicing diet and lost 8st in just 90 days. But she suffered horrific side effects, including hair loss and stomach cramps. Paige said: 'It was horrendous. I was pleased that the weight was coming off, but I felt terrible. My periods stopped, and I was an emotional wreck. 'After three months, I just couldn't cope with it any longer and decided to lose weight in a healthier way.' For the next eight months, Paige ate small portions of healthy food such as fruit, salad and bran flakes. Combined with a weekly five-mile walk with her younger sister, Darcy, 19, Paige lost a further 5st  - taking her total weight loss to an impressive 13st by May 2014. Paige, who now weighs just 10st, says that her weight-loss has completely changed her life and she regrets waiting so long to make a change. She said: 'I've never felt better about myself. All of my family keep telling me how great I look, and for the first time in my life, I actually feel it. 'I think that anyone who feels uncomfortable about their body should take the plunge and do something about it. If I can do it, then anyone can.' Paige, who now weighs just 10st, says that her weight-loss has completely changed her life and she regrets waiting so long to make a change . Now on the lookout for Mr Right, single Paige said that she is actually grateful to her ex for shaming her into losing weight (left, Paige before, right, her now) However, Paige admits that her transformation has also led to the loss of friends, who are jealous that she now steals their limelight. Paige said: 'When I go out now, I like to look glamorous. I finally feel confident in myself and I like showing off my body. 'I never used to get any attention from men, so it's nice to get the odd wolf-whistle or guy asking for my number. 'I have had friends come up to me and tell me that they can't go out with me anymore because I'm getting all of the attention that they used to get. 'It's a shame that they can't be happy for me, but at least now I know who my real friends are.' Now on the lookout for Mr Right, single Paige said that she is actually grateful to her ex for shaming her into losing weight. She added: 'Every time I think back to the night at the hotel, it makes me cringe. But it made me make a change. 'Now I'm happier than I've ever been - and I definitely haven't had any complaints about my belly since!'","At 5ft 3 and 23st Paige's BMI was 57, making her morbidly obese .

'The hard thing for me about this game is the relationships and how you get used to seeing people every day,' Yankees manager Joe Girardi said, 'and how abruptly it ends. 'Since (he was) a young man signing, really a teenager, it's really what he's known. It's what we've known him to be, the Yankees' shortstop, and it's hard to believe that it's coming to an end.' Before the game, Boston manager John Farrell praised Jeter for 'a grace and a dignity, an integrity that probably is unmatched by others.' Girardi had expected Jeter to receive a warm reception in enemy territory. 'Boston understands what Derek has meant to the Yankees playing him all these times,' Girardi said.

"Frank Mankiewicz, the press secretary who went before television cameras to announce the death of Senator Robert F Kennedy, died yesterday aged 90. The former  political director for presidential candidate George McGovern died of a heart attack at George Washington University Hospital, according to family friend and journalist Adam Clymer. Mankiewicz was a longtime Democratic political operative as well as a lawyer, journalist and author. McGovern once recalled his former campaign aide as a perceptive, straightforward political adviser. Frank Mankiewicz, Senator Robert F. Kennedy's press secretary, tells a news conference outside Good Samaritan hospital in Los Angeles, in 5 June 1968  that Kennedy is in 'extremely critical condition' 'I never got any bad advice from Frank,' said McGovern, a senator from South Dakota who was the Democratic nominee for president in 1972. 'I found him just fascinating to travel with during the campaign. I picked up a lot of perspective, a lot of insights and a lot of humor from Frank.' The son and nephew of Hollywood filmmakers, Mankiewicz studied journalism and law. He worked for newspapers in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles before assuming the role of President John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps director in Lima, Peru, in 1962 and later was a regional director in Washington. He was also political director for presidential candidate George McGovern who ran in the 1972 election . In 1966, he became press secretary to Senator Robert Kennedy, who was assassinated two years later while campaigning for the party's presidential nomination. In June 1968, Kennedy had just won the California primary and finished his victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Mankiewicz left the entourage for a moment to help the candidate's wife, Ethel, step off a platform. 'She was at the time three months pregnant, although I don't think anybody knew it, except the inside group,' Mankiewicz recalled on the 30th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination. 'We helped her down. And then she said, 'Go on,' and we started to move off quickly to catch up. And that's when we heard the shots.' Kennedy was gunned down in a kitchen pantry by Sirhan Sirhan, a young Palestinian later convicted of his murder. In 1966, he became press secretary to Senator Robert Kennedy, who was assassinated two years later while campaigning for the party's presidential nomination . Mankiewicz has a few words with presidential candidate George McGovern before his appearance NBC . Mankiewicz issued medical bulletins throughout the day as Kennedy lingered near death at The Good Samaritan Hospital. Some 26 hours later, Mankiewicz emerged, pale and haggard but poised, to deliver tragic news. 'I have a short announcement to read which I will read at this time. Sen. Robert Francis Kennedy died at 1:44 a.m. today, June 6, 1968. ... He was 42 years old,' Mankiewicz said. He would later recall: 'That, in many ways, was the shaping influence in my adult life.' Mankiewicz went to work for McGovern in 1971, reflecting some time afterward that he 'thought McGovern had the right issues, and history has tended to bear him out.' An outspoken critic of Richard Nixon, Mankiewicz wrote two books about the disgraced president: 'Perfectly Clear: Nixon From Whittier to Watergate' and 'U.S. v. Richard M. Nixon: The Final Crisis.' He was delighted when Nixon resigned. 'I think we should celebrate Aug. 9 as a day of national liberation every year,' he told the Philadelphia Bulletin. 'Every country celebrates the day the government got rid of its tyrants. We should too.' After McGovern's decisive defeat, Mankiewicz wrote a column for The Washington Post and in 1976 made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for a House seat from Maryland. The political adviser went to work  for McGovern in 1971, reflecting some time afterward that he 'thought McGovern had the right issues, and history has tended to bear him out' Mankiewicz is seen on the right of this picture with Edwin Schlossberg, husband of Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, left, with their children, Rose, Jack and Tatiana . He was named president of National Public Radio in 1977 and was credited with strengthening its news operation and doubling its audience.

"More than one in six civil servants has been sacked under the coalition’s austerity cuts, new figures revealed today. Since 2010 more than 87,000 staff have been laid off, taking total headcount to under 440,000. The government boasts that the civil service is now smaller than at any point since the Second World War but unions warn services will suffer. Since 2010 more than 87,000 staff have been laid off, taking total headcount to under 440,000, according to the Office for National Statistics . Deep spending cuts since the 2010 election have cut the deficit from £140billion to around £94billion this year. While tax rises and benefit cuts have saved billions, big reductions have been made in the number of people on the public sector payroll. In March 2010, just before the general election, there were 527,500 people employed in the civil service. New figures from the Office for National Statistics today show the number is down 17 per cent to 439,900. A Cabinet Office source said: ‘As part of this Government’s long-term economic plan we are making Whitehall more efficient. ‘This year the Civil Service reached its smallest level since the Second World War with productivity significantly increased since the 2010 General Election. ‘Our overall efficiency reforms helped save taxpayers £14.3 billion last year alone, compared to spending under Labour in 2009-10.’ Overall the number of full-time civil servants fell by 7,353 to 332,692 between March 2013 and March 2014. The number of part-timers fell by 1,540 to 107,250. Workers classed as being at the ‘administrative responsibility level’ saw the biggest job losses in the last year, down 9.4 per cent. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said cutting civil service jobs is not 'glamorous headline-grabbing stuff' but is needed to cut the deficit . At the same time the number of employees working at the Senior Civil Service responsibility level increased by 11.8 per cent. There was an increase of 7.9 per cent in the number of Grades 6 and 7 – some of the best paid people in Whitehall - and an increase of 7.3 per cent in the number of Senior and Higher Executive Officers, the ONS said. The number of people working in the civil service aged over 50 rose, but the number of employees in all other age bands fell. Cabinet office minister Francis Maude used his speech to the Tory conference last week to insist there was more to do to reduce numbers. 'We’ve cut the size of the Civil Service - down 17 per cent so far, with more to come,' he said. 'None of this is glamorous headline-grabbing stuff. It’s hard detailed grind. Getting deep into the numbers; asking tough questions; long meetings renegotiating over-rich contracts with some of the biggest companies in the world. 'And it won’t surprise you that not everyone in Whitehall was as enthusiastic as we were. So I’m really grateful to the Prime Minister and Chancellor for their unstinting support for the difficult things we were driving through. 'This is about efficient and effective government, government that cares about public services and cares about the taxpayer.' The number of civil servants in most regions fell, but in London, the South West and Northern Ireland there were small increases. The North East, widely seen as one of the regions most reliant on state-funded jobs, saw the largest percentage fall, down 7.8 per cent in the year to March. Pay also rose in the Civil Service, up by £350 or 1.5 per cent in a year to £24,730. Next week up to a quarter of a million civil servants will stage a strike in protest at pay restraint and job cuts. A spokesman for the PCS union said: ‘The focus of the strike next week is pay but we include in that cuts to jobs as well because all of those cuts flow from the decision to cut public spending which we say is not necessary. ‘Where services are being provided to the public, if you cut the number of people doing it, inevitably services will suufer. ‘The headline figures on job cuts are pretty shocking. But if you look at something like the Passport Office, at the start of the summer we saw exactly what the impact of job cuts was.’ Thousands of people faced delays in applying for passports as officials struggled to get a grip on a mounting backlog.","Since 2010 more than 87,000 staff have been axed, ONS figures show .
The total civil service headcount has now dropped to to under 440,000 .
Biggest falls among full-time staff and those in administrative roles .

"Self-confessed adrenaline junkie great-grandmother Nora Brier celebrated her 100th birthday by doing a loop-the-loop in a glider, saying she 'loved every minute of it'. Former nurse Nora had previously enjoyed going up in a glider, which inspired her daughters Kay Draper, 58, and Sonya Long, 52, to arrange the surprise flight at Wattisham Airfield in Suffolk. Nora, from Hopton, Suffolk, took two eight-minute flights, getting a chance to control the aircraft on the first time up and with a pilot showing her an entire new angle on the world from 11,000ft with a loop-the-loop on the second. Scroll down for video . Nora Brier celebrated her 100th birthday with a loop-the-loop in a glider in Suffolk . Nora took two flights at Wattisham Airfield in Suffolk, first controlling the craft and then doing a loop-the-loop . 'I'm so grateful to my daughters who got it all planned for me,' she said. 'I'd been in a glider several years ago and they knew I liked that sort of thing so thought it would be a good gift. 'I wasn't nervous at all, I really enjoyed it. Although I had no idea it was going to be any different to before so I was really shocked when I did a loop-the-loop. 'I would say I am a bit of an adrenaline junkie, I always look forward to my birthdays where I get to do something a bit different.' For Nora's 95th birthday she went on the back of a Harley Davidson motorbike while on her 80th she took a hot air balloon ride - she's also flown in a microlight and a helicopter. Nora's two daughters, Kay Draper and Sonya Long, gave her two eight-minute flights as a surprise present . Nora, a former nurse from Hopton in Suffolk, says she is 'a bit of an adrenaline junkie' Daughter Kay, a glider pilot herself who works as an occupational therapist, said the loss of her second husband Tom Brier, who died at the age of 78 in 1982 with emphysema, contributed to  Nora becoming the adrenaline junkie she is now. Nora's first husband died in a Japanese prison camp during World War II in 1943. 'She spent many years looking after [Tom],' said Kay. 'She was always very very busy when we were younger and I suppose it was only after all of that her horizons opened up and she had time for herself. 'She is completely fearless and that had a wonderful influence on us growing up. 'I took her flying in a glider once and she really liked it and I thought her 100th birthday would be a great time for her to do it again. 'She asked me if she could paraglide with the Red Kites but I told her a line had to be drawn somewhere and it wouldn't be sensible at her age. But she would do it all if she could.'","Nora Brier celebrated her 100th birthday with a loop-the-loop in a glider .

"Senator Nova Peris has denied using taxpayer money to facilitate an extra-marital affair with Trinidad and Tobago sprinter Ato Boldon during an address to the Federal Senate. The former athlete defended herself against the charge following the publication of a string of emails by NT News which also revealed she was allegedly having a sexual relationship with Boldon in 2010. The exchanges - which Ms Peris said she could not authenticate because she did not have them to hand - which also included derogatory remarks about her friend and fellow Olympian Cathy Freeman. During her address to the Upper House in Canberra on Thursday, Senator Peris said the emails were leaked as part of a long-running family dispute. Scroll down for video . Northern Territory senator Nova Peris has denied she misused public funds to carry out an affair . Australia's first female indigenous senator fought back tears as she told her colleagues that the accusations about her misusing taxpayer funds were 'baseless'. 'I categorically object to any wrong doing,' Senator Peris said. Senator Peris said she was never responsible for the money used to bring Boldon over for an athletics program. 'Athletics Australia has confirmed that my role was establishing initial contact with Mr Boldon,' she said. Senator Peris added Australian Sports Commission had confirmed Athletics Australia had 'fully acquitted the funds provided, including independent auditor confirmation, that they were spent for the purposes they were provided'. In the email exchanges, it is also claimed Ms Peris compared her alleged sexual relations with Boldon as being 'just like a tim-tam… black on black' and boasting that 'white men can't control black women'. Through tears, Ms Peris said the emails were meant to 'embarrass me and my family' Senator Peris said she did not have a copy of the emails and could not comment on their 'thoracity'. 'What I can say is that views attributed to me based on selected words... in private emails certainly don't reflect my views, my values and the evidence of this is the life I have continued to lead,' she said. In her address, Senator Peris said she was told in 2010 via a representative that an 'aggrieved party' who was in possession of the leaked emails was prepared to take action that would 'only result in trauma for everyone, especially the children, and damage the reputation of some stakeholders'. She was contacted again on October 9 this year and read the correspondence between them to the senate. 'The first line read: ""I am sending this communication to you today to ensure there is no mistake as to who is responsible for releasing the information in relation to you"",' Senator Peris recited. Senator Peris said the NT News was aware the emails were part of the family dispute when they published the emails. 'The release and publication of these emails [was an] attempt to extract money from me, and embarrass me and my family,' she said. The emails contained derogatory comments about Cathy Freeman and emerged less than a fortnight after they were photographed smiling and embracing at a function in Melbourne on October 17 . The Northern Territory senator is accused of carrying out an affair with former sprinter Ato Boldon (pictured here in 1997) The senator said she had also talked to former Olympian Cathy Freeman about the emails. One of the emails described the Australian gold medallist as 'so so dumb' who had 'zero communication skills'. After speaking with Freeman, Senator Peris told the senate: 'Our friendship remains strong and we will continue to support each other.' The emergence of the emails came less than a fortnight after they were photographed smiling and embracing at a function in Melbourne on October 17, which was posted on the senator's Facebook page and on the official Cathy Freeman Foundation. On Thursday, Senator Peris said she remained proud of who she was and would continue to protect her children - describing them as her 'universe'. 'Despite the hopes of some, this incident will not stop me from serving the people of the Northern Territory and advocating on behalf of Aboriginal Australians,' she said. Senator Peris said she had been overwhelmed by the support she had received from the public and colleagues on both sides of politics during the past couple of days. After her statement to the senate, Labor senators comforted her.","Senator Nova Peris was accused by a newspaper of using taxpayer money for sexual liaison .

"A series of online ads  released this week by a Republican organization for college students are being called 'sexist' by some women for the way they believe the commercials talk down to young, female voters. The minute-long ads, created by the College Republican National Committee, spoof the TLC show Say Yes to the Dress and feature a recent college grad shopping for a wedding dress with her mother and friends. For anyone who's ever seen the popular reality TV program on which the ads are based, the CNRC Say Yes to the Candidate videos are a spot-on parody of the drama that typically plays out in each episode of the show. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The College Republican National Committee is getting flak from some women over the way it recently spoofed the TLC show Say Yes to the Dress as part of an election-year ad campaign . The online ads, which are running in 16 states, feature a recent college grad shopping for a wedding dress with her mother and friends. Each dress is named after a candidate in November's elections. The prettier dress, shown above, is always a Republican candidate . A mother and daughter bicker over which dress is the 'one' as the bride's mother insists 'I know best,' the bride-to-be's tag alongs take the side of their friend, and in the end, the woman walking down the aisle settles on the dress she wanted all along. The wedding dresses in the ads serve as metaphors for various political candidates in November's elections, and locally targeted versions of the campaign spots are running online in 16 states. The more attractive wedding dress in the ad is favored by an undecided voter and young bride identified as Brittany. The uglier, more expensive dress, which comes with 'additional costs, including '$2 billion in taxes, $3.6 billion in debt and 15 percent tuition increases' is her mom's first choice. Notably, the simple dress in the spoofs represents Republican candidates, and the frumpy dress always shares a name with a Democratic candidate. While conservatives and Republicans are lauding the ads as quirky and refreshing, the CRNC has taken flak for the million-dollar ad campaign from women who perceive the commercials as demeaning to female voters. Time magazine's Charlotte Alter called the campaign the 'Most Sexist Republican Ad of the Year' and blasted the CRNC for belittling women. 'Because women don’t like dirty old politics, women like wedding dresses!' she sarcastically wrote. Alter also took issue with the way the ad boils down financial issues to 'an ugly veil, ugly sash, and ugly necklace. Because veils are easier to understand than debt, obviously,' she opined. A writer for the New Republic, a left-leaning publication, also labeled the ads as 'offensive' in a piece and 'condescending' in her headline. Elle's Sally Holmes trashed them as a 'half-a**ed attempt at brainwashing' and claimed that the videos make 'NO SENSE. None, zero, zilch.' The Democratic Governor's Association piled on, saying in a statement that the ads are 'further evidence' that Republicans 'still have no idea how to communicate with women voters.' 'That’s because it’s not just their attitudes that are condescending and insulting, but because their policies – from deep cuts to education to opposition to equal pay for equal work, to mandatory ultrasounds and defunding Planned Parenthood – are deeply out-of-touch with the concerns of women and families,' spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said. The frumpy dress, featured here, is always a Democrat running in that state's election . The mother and daughter bicker over which dress is the 'one' as the bride's mother insists 'I know best' and tries to push the bride-to-be to pick the dress named after a Democrat . CNRC Chair, Alex Smith, the first woman to be elected to the organization's top spot, defended the campaign in the Wall Street Journal as an attempt by her majority-female staff to speak to young women in a 'culturally relevant way.' Smith was backed up by a spokeswoman for Young America's Foundation, another conservative organization for college students, on Twitter. 'So clever. Nice work. Way to reach young females in a creative way,' YAF's Ashley Pratte tweeted. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus also thew his support behind Smith and the CRNC. 'I think it's a pretty clever ad,' he said, according to the Washington Examiner's Betsy Woodruff. Making fun of the attention being heaped on the controversial set of ads, Susan J. Demas, a columnist for MLive.com, a website that focuses on news related to Michigan, joked that she was bothered by the way her state's male governor, Rick Snyder, a Republican, was objectified in the Michigan-based version of the ad and treated with 'disrespect.' 'Yes, she's actually comparing the governor of Michigan to a shiny piece of fabric. I was flabbergasted,' Demas stated. 'How can they get away with such patronizing tripe?' Demas went on to say Snyder 'is more than just a pretty face' and points out that he earned three degrees in six years from the University of Michigan.","Some female writers have taken offense to the ads because they of what they perceive as talking down to women .

"These dazzling needle-like icicles that adorn the cliffs of Lake Superior draw almost 150,000 visitors every year. It allows them to explore waterfalls frozen in place, entire cliff faces encased in inches of ice and breathtaking icicles glistening in the milky sun. The geological marvels at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore have proved popular since they opened to winter travellers in 2009. Visitors to the site take in spectacular views such as waterfalls frozen in place - to manage the growing number of visitors, the National Park Service has proposed a $5 special recreation fee . The stunning icicles and views have seen almost 150,000 visitors marvel at the sights since it opened to winter travellers in 2009 . Pillars of ice hang from the cliff edge where waterfalls have hardened in place, bringing with it jaw-dropping views . But now, the National Park Service which operates the park in northern Wisconsin, has proposed a $5 special recreation fee to see the jaw-dropping site. The current $3 parking fee at the trail head lot brought in $47,000 last year, which was only a fraction of what it costs to manage about 138,000 visitors, according to the agency. The proposed permit fee would allow the park service to provide sufficient staff and infrastructure during open ice caves season, although it wouldn't cover all of the associated costs. During the summer, the caves are a popular destination as they can be accessed by kayak, but they're even more of a draw during winter when as many as 1,000 people a day make the trip on the weekend.

The park service plans to hold two open houses this month, one in Ashland and the other Bayfield, where the new fee will be discussed and members of the public will be able to put forward their views. Because of ideal weather last winter, the lakeshore's mainland sea caves were open for the first time since 2009, when they saw fewer than 10,000 visitors.

"A member of Warren Jeffs' polygamous sect who oversaw an Idaho home where nine boys were sent on 'repentance missions' by their parents has been given jail time on child abuse charges that included locking one teen in a furnace room for two days. Nathan C. Jessop, 49, was sentenced to 90 days in jail Tuesday after previously pleading guilty to three counts of misdemeanor injury to a child. Another 360 days in jail were suspended. Jessop belongs to Warren Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, whose members believe polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. Abuser: Nathan Jessop will serve 90 days in jail for pleading guilty to three counts of injury to a child and is barred from having any children live in his home, other than his own . Sick fantasies: Nine boys were pulled from a Pocatello, Idaho home back in July after one of them escaped . Jessop told police the boys are members of Warren Jeffs' (pictured) Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, based on the Utah-Arizona border, and sent to him by their parents because they had been disobedient . Sect leader Warren Jeffs was a notorious child abuser and it would appear his vile habits also spread to several other of his followers . He is the son of high-ranking FLDS member Merril Jessop, who is serving 10 years in a Texas prison for presiding over the marriage of his then-12-year-old daughter to Jeffs. Nathan Jessop told police the boys, ages 12 to 17, also were church members and were sent to him by their parents because they were disobedient. He acknowledged physically disciplining them, saying the boys were hard to handle and had not learned to behave. Nathan Jessop acknowledged in court that he locked one of the boys in the furnace room. Prosecutors also said he failed to report that two other boys ran away. The nine boys were pulled out of the Pocatello home in July after a boy who escaped reported the abuse. Bannock County Prosecutor Stephen Herzog said the case wasn't about religion. Eastern Idaho has a large Mormon population. 'What we are talking about is just an individual and what our basic assumptions are about how we treat kids and how we protect their health and safety, and I think that's really what the case was all about,' he said. Seized: The notorious Temple of the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints at the Yearning For Zion ranch in Eldorado, Texas was seized after allegations of the abuse of young girls . Jeffs' many wives, some of whom helped him assault younger women by holding them down while he raped them, pose for a picture . Repeated assault: Jeffs repeatedly assaulted young girls and told them if they didn't cooperate, then they would be punished by God . Two of the boys are with foster families. The others returned to family members who belong to the FLDS church, which is based on the Utah-Arizona border. 'Nathan Jessop is a good man, and he is a good person in a bad circumstance, and there are always two sides to every story, and I believe that he is a very good person and he has taken full responsibility for what he did,' said his attorney Ron Tyler Bird. One of Nathan Jessop's wives, Tammy Jessop, lived in the house too. She told police she was in charge of preparing meals and being the boys' home school teacher. She also taught them to make furniture that was sold in Idaho and Utah. The boys told police they wouldn't get a breakfast if they didn't wake up by 6 a.m. and that the pantries were locked so they wouldn't eat between meals. They said they sneaked out to get fast food using money they earned doing odd jobs. They got no money from the furniture sales, the report said. Neighbors Stephen and Roma Hurley said the boys would do odd jobs for them, such as mowing their lawn, to make money. They said they didn't know much about Nathan Jessop. 'I just never saw the man,' Roma Hurley said. 'I think he was extremely secretive.' Jeffs is in a Texas prison, where he is a serving a life sentence for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered brides. He still reportedly gives orders from there. Polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the mainstream Mormonism church and its 15 million members worldwide abandoned the practice in 1890 and strictly prohibit it.","Nine boys were pulled from a Pocatello home back in July after one of them escaped .

"The pilot of a holiday jet to Tenerife declared a Mayday emergency after one of its two engines failed at 35,000ft over the Atlantic. The Jet2 flight from Glasgow was packed with families – including three babies and 47 children aged two to 16 – heading for sunshine breaks during the half-term school holiday. The drama began as the Boeing 737-800 with 197 people on board – 191 passengers and six crew – was 30 minutes from its destination. Scroll down for video . The pilot of a Jet2 flight from Glasgow to Tenerife declared a Mayday emergency after one of its two engines failed at 35,000ft . The airline confirmed to the Daily Mail that the pilot of the aircraft, registered G-GDFY, had issued a Mayday alert three-quarters of the way through the three and a half hour flight to the holiday isle on Monday after the engine failed. It said there had been an 'engine oil pressure issue' which led to the 'controlled shutdown' of one engine as a 'precautionary measure' following a 'technical fault indication'. The incident has been logged with UK and Spanish safety authorities, it said. As a UK registered plane, the pilot has to file an incident report within four days to the Civil Aviation Authority. The drama on board flight LS155, which took off on Monday at 9am, happened just north of the Portuguese island of Madeira. The aircraft descended quickly by 10,000ft to 25,000ft to stabilise. The drama on board flight LS155, which took off on Monday at 9am, happened just 30 minutes before it was due to land when flying  just north of the Portuguese island of Madeira . An airline spokesman said there had been an 'engine oil pressure issue' which led to the 'controlled shutdown' before landing at Tenerife Airport (pictured) One insider said that in addition to the verbal Mayday the pilot had issued a 'Squawk 7700' digital alert code to warn air traffic controllers on their screens of the emergency. 'There were oil pressure warnings on the Number 1 engine which was subsequently shut down,' said the insider. 'The pilot issued a Squawk 7700 Mayday emergency warning to air traffic controllers.' A spokesman for Jet2 said: 'Flight LS155 departed Glasgow on Monday morning at 9am local time. 'Around 30 minutes prior to landing in Tenerife passengers were informed there would be a controlled shutdown of one of the engines as a precautionary measure, due to a technical fault indication. The aircraft landed safely at 13.38.' Jet2 said its aircraft are always within 60 minutes' flying time of an airport if flying on a single engine, adding: 'Flight Ops (operations) confirmed the pilot carried out a precautionary engine shutdown in line with Boeing procedures.' Last week, angry Jet2 passengers said they were left to wait an hour in the cold at Manchester Airport after their Alicante flight was diverted there. Holidaymakers returning from Spain on Thursday night described the scenes as 'total chaos'. The flight was originally scheduled for Blackpool but Jet2 changed the destination after an announcement the airport would be closing when no buyer could be found. Passenger Jackie Hughson said people, including those who were elderly and infirm, had to walk a long distance to the terminal, adding: 'People had to struggle on a long walk to get to where the coaches were supposed to be and there were no wheelchairs.' Jet2 apologised for the disruption, adding: 'The Alicante flight was originally set to return to Blackpool Airport. However, restrictions in place at Blackpool meant we had to return to Manchester.'","Holiday jet flying from Glasgow to Tenerife declared a Mayday emergency .

"The terror suspect who was shot dead by a policeman was on top of a second officer, stabbing him in the chest and face when he was gunned down, an inquest into his death has heard. Numan Haider, 18, was killed with a single shot to the head after pulling a knife from his jacket and attacking the officers outside Endeavour Hills police station in suburban Melbourne on September 23.

"A grandmother and her four-year-old granddaughter have drowned after they went to a lake to feed the ducks. Relatives suspect that Laura Zulema Fleming, 59, jumped into the water at Silver Lake, a gated community in Miramar, Florida, on Sunday after her granddaughter Leila  fell in, WSVN reported.

Autopsies were carried out on Monday and they were both found to have drowned, Miramar police spokeswoman Tania Rues said, the Sun Sentinel reported. 'Unfortunately, it appears they had been deceased for a period of time,' she said. 'Based on accounts from family members, neither the grandmother nor the 4-year-old knew how to swim.' Fleming had taken her granddaughter out to the water around 7pm on Sunday. 'The information that we gathered from the family is that she was a very doting grandmother, was always with the grandchild and they would go out on occasion,' Rues said. 'It was not something the family thought was unusual for them to do.' Missed: Leila is pictured with her father George, left, and mother Ashli, right, who does not live with the family.

"GPs have been told to ask teenagers if they have been victims of revenge porn. New guidelines have been drawn up to spot youngsters being made ill as a result of anxiety caused by sexting, cyber-bullying and radicalisation online. The pressures of young people's lives played out online means they could be the trigger for headaches and stomach pains, or the reason while children start to play truant, the Royal College of GPs warns. Family doctors should look for signs of modern social problems such as sexting and cyber-bullying, the Royal College of GPs has warned . A shocking study earlier this year found children now see 'sexting' as part of normal life. The anti-bulling charity Ditch the Label found that 62 per cent of young people had been abused through a smartphone app, while 37 per cent had sent a naked photo of themselves, and 24 per cent had seen that image shared without their consent. Girls were twice as likely to send a naked photo to someone than boys, the report said. Now family doctors have been asked to look for signs of fears about internet pressures causing health problems. Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'Children and young people today are facing unprecedented pressures from all angles at a younger and younger age. 'The arrival of the internet and social media has opened up so many opportunities but has also brought many threats, including cyberbullying, sexting and revenge porn. 'The unique relationship that GPs have with our patients means that we build up their trust and confidence over time and this places us in an ideal position to identify potential risks to the physical and mental health of our young people.' The RCGP and children's charity the NSPCC have launched a 'toolkit' of advice today for doctors to help them identify issues, which also include female genital mutilation and forced marriage. With doctors said to be on the 'front line', the RCGP said it was issuing the guidance, taking in advice from police, social workers, schools and government agencies, so they were better informed about what to do if they had concerns for a child. Dr Baker added: 'As GPs we are trained to treat the 'whole person' and that means now taking into account a number of societal, as well as health, factors,' she said. 'A consultation with a GP may be the only time that young people can be alone with a trusted adult and we have a number of roles to play in providing understanding, compassion and support.' Worries about online bullying can lead to health problems including anxiety, headaches and stomach pains . According to latest figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), 43,140 children were subject to a child protection plan and 68,110 children were 'looked after' in England in 2013. Dawn Hodson, the NSPCC's neglect development manager said: 'GPs play a very significant role in keeping children safe, previous NSPCC research found that for every child subject to a child protection plan or on a child protection register, we estimate that another eight have suffered maltreatment.' Doctors say sexting cases have become a major problem among two age groups. Children aged between six and eight swap intimate pictures of themselves out of curiosity about the differences between the sexes. But young teenagers know the images are sexual and share them with a boyfriend or girlfriend, but face devastating consequences if the pictures are later shared without their consent.","Royal College of GPs issues guidance to look for signs of cyber-bullying .

"Crown these Royals the American League champions. After nearly three decades spent trying to return to the playoffs, Kansas City is taking its perfect postseason ride all the way to the World Series. With more dominant defense, an opportunistic offense that plated two runs in the first inning, and a bullpen that shut down the Baltimore Orioles once again, Greg Holland and the wild-card Royals wrapped up a sweep of the AL Championship Series with a 2-1 victory on Wednesday. Royals relief pitcher Greg Holland (left) hugs catcher Salvador Perez (right) in celebration after defeating the Baltimore Orioles in game four of the 2014 ALCS playoffs at Kauffman Stadium as the team advances to the World Series for the first time since 1985 . Paul Rudd takes a selfie photo with  manager Ned Yost (right) after the Royals complete their sweep . Catcher Salvador Perez races across the field as the Royals take the game 2-1 . Next stop: The Royals' first Fall Classic since 1985. They'll face the winner of the NLCS between the Giants and Cardinals. San Francisco leads 2-1. 'It's been an amazing run. This is great,' said left fielder Alex Gordon, who made another jarring catch. 'We've been playing pretty good baseball. It's nothing better than when you win. Today, same old story: good pitching, good defense and scratch out a win.' After holding the Orioles to three hits in Game 3 on Tuesday night, Jason Vargas and the Royals bullpen nearly turned the trick again. Kelvin Herrera and Wade Davis ushered the game to Holland, who matched Dennis Eckersley's record by saving his fourth game in the ALCS. After Holland got J.J. Hardy to ground out to third base for the final out, the Royals spilled onto the infield in a wild celebration. Fireworks shot over the crown-shaped scoreboard in center field, and a blue-clad sellout crowd that included Royals great George Brett let out a roar. Kansas City will host the first two World Series games beginning Tuesday. Coincidentally, it was the Cardinals who the Royals beat for their only World Series title in a dramatic seven-game series. In the first inning, Royal Nori Aoki was struck by a pitch . The Royals will face the winner of the NLCS between the Giants and Cardinals. San Francisco leads 2-1. Regardless of the opponent, the Royals will carry an 11-game playoff win streak into the World Series, one shy of the major league record. That includes winning their first eight games this season, something that had never been done in postseason history. Kansas City beat Oakland in the wild card and swept the Los Angeles Angels in the Division Series. 'We know once we have the lead, we've got the best pitching staff and the best bullpen around. So we've got to get them the lead,' said Eric Hosmer, who drove in a run. 'We're not done. We ain't done yet.' That includes winning their first eight games this season, something that had never been done in postseason history . Kansas City beat Oakland in the wild card and swept the Los Angeles Angels in the Division Series . The Orioles, meanwhile, will limp into the offseason after their first sweep in 21 playoff series, dating to the days when the club was called the St. Louis Browns. Making his first start in nearly two weeks, Vargas shut down the vaunted Orioles lineup. The only damage he allowed came in the third inning, when Ryan Flaherty led off with a home run that just skirted the foul pole in right field. By that point, the Royals had already manufactured a pair of runs. Now, just four more stand in the way of an improbable World Series championship . Alcides Escobar singled off Orioles starter Miguel Gonzalez to open the game, and Nori Aoki was drilled on the right knee a couple pitches later. Royals manager Ned Yost then opted to bunt with Lorenzo Cain, one of his hottest hitters, to advance both of the runners. It was a questionable decision so early in the game. But like almost every unorthodox move that Yost has made this postseason, it worked out perfectly. Hosmer followed with a chopping groundball, and first baseman Steve Pearce went home with it. Escobar slid safely and the ball bounded away from catcher Caleb Joseph, allowing Aoki to follow his teammate home and giving the scrappy, small-ball Royals a 2-0 lead. After that, it was up to their defense and bullpen. Fireworks shot over the crown-shaped scoreboard in center field, and a blue-clad sellout crowd that included Royals great George Brett let out a roar . Kansas City Royals owner David Glass holds up the trophy after the Royals defeated the Baltimore Orioles 2-1 in Game 4 of the American League baseball championship series . Escobar turned a pair of double plays early in the game to help Vargas escape jams, and Gordon made a spectacular catch while crashing into the left-field wall to rob Hardy of extra bases leading off the fifth inning. In the sixth, second baseman Omar Infante was in perfect position to snag Nelson Cruz's line drive and leave runners on the corners. Herrera breezed through the seventh and Davis handled the eighth, just as they have all season, and Holland slammed the door on his fourth save of the series. And set off of a wild celebration that had been 29 years in the making. In the midst of it all was Yost, the often-criticized Royals manager who has guided a collection of budding young stars to baseball's grandest stage. In doing so, Yost became the first manager in major league history to win his first eight postseason games. Now, just four more stand in the way of an improbable World Series championship.","Wild-card Royals wrapped up a sweep of the AL Championship Series with a 2-1 victory on Wednesday .

"Real life Baywatch hunk Michael Newman has given a fascinating glimpse behind the scenes of the 1980s TV hit. The former LA lifeguard starred in a never-before seen 'teaser tape' that was used to sell Baywatch to TV chiefs, which today he unveils to MailOnline. Now 59, Michael was a regular stand-in for David Hasselhoff because of the star’s ‘chicken legs' - and even taught Baywatch bombshell Pamela Anderson how to run on the beach. Stand-in: Michael Newman with Baywatch star David Hasselhoff. Newman's legs were used to cover up The Hoff's 'chicken legs', he says . Chicken legs: Professional lifeguard Michael Newman (right) said he often stood in for 6ft 4ins tall David Hasselhoff (left) due to his skinny legs . Michael - affectionately nicknamed Newmie - said: 'There were many times when Alex Daniels, who was David’s stunt double on the show, and I filmed dangerous scenes together, and I would be driving a powerful race boat and Alex would be having to jump down into the boat going at some 60mph from a 70ft cliff edge and not land in the ocean, then he has to trust me to the right place at just the right time. ‘Most of the time, when you saw Hasselhoff’s legs, you were often looking at my own legs. Hasselhoff always had very skinny chicken legs!' Newmie also worked as a technical advisor on Baywatch and admitted that although slender, many of the actors weren't fit enough for the show - so he had to put them through his own training camp. He said: 'I’d teach them how to run with the lifeguard can and how to swim with your head up and get the basics down, so that when Pamela Anderson ran with the can it didn’t look like she was holding a purse!’ ‘I was technical consultant on the show and was constantly asked by the writers about every action scene we shot. 'The head writer on the show would call me up and say: ""Ok Mike, what kind of equipment would we use in this scene? What kind of radio equipment would the actors use? What would the traffic sequence be? What would they be saying on the radio?"" And I would dictate all this information to these guys and they would repay me by writing me some good stuff in the show.’ The show never did win an Emmy as Newmie says: 'It’s so hard to remember all the storylines, but one thing I will say about the scripts is that we used to laugh because they they would adapt stories from all over the place and make them work for Baywatch. ‘There was an episode with an electric eel that was attacking one of our guys in a cave, and so we used defibrillator patterns, the heart shocking device, to shock the eel and kill it, but it was a rubber eel. It was the stupidest thing I had ever seen!' You get the idea: Michael Newman starred in a 'teaser tape' for what his childhood buddy and fellow lifeguard Greg Bonnan would use to sell his idea for Baywatch to TV chiefs . Co-stars: Michael Newman with Baywatch bombshell Pamela Anderson. The professional lifeguard trained Pam and other show stars . Baywatch was the brainchild of his schoolpal and fellow lifeguard Greg Bonnan, who got him on board to film a trailer on Santa Monica beach - complete with the now famous slow-motion running. Bonnan, Newmie said, had long dreamed of making a show about lifeguards, telling his pal: ‘You know, if that piece of s**t show CHIPS can be so popular, why can’t we make a television show about lifeguards?’ After a busy day on the Santa Monica shore, Newmie said: ‘We’d had one of those days where we’d had lost kids and rescues and fights and drunks and people breaking into cars and umbrellas stabbing people - it was just a crazy chaotic day. ‘And so we decided to go and have a beer after work and think some more about it.’ Fate dealt a hand when Bonnan rescued the 13-year-old son of TV executive Stu Erwin in 1978. When asked how he could repay him, Bonnan asked for help with his TV idea, which the pair worked on for 10 years. Fun in the sun: Greg Bonnan's tape of course included glimpes of bikini-clad girls on the beach . Eighties-style: Baywatch became a byword for scenes of scantily-clad girls . A smash hit: Baywatch was axed by NBC after its first season in 1989 - but Hasselhoff and the show's creators teamed up with producters FreemantleMedia to turn it into a syndicated, international hit . Newmie also reveals that fate again stepped in when Bonnan’s sister married a successful TV writer called Doug Schwartz, who ended up becoming a producer on Baywatch. Greg sold the show to NBC after showing them the tape and the show launched in 1989. But even though it featured the star of Knight Rider, Baywatch was axed after one season, prompting Hasselhoff and the producers to sell it to FreemantleMedia which sold the show internationally and created a syndication deal. It went on to become the most watched TV series in the world, running up until 2001, and Hasselhoff, who played Mitch Buchannon, is believed to have made $70 million from the series. Key player: Michael Newman with Baywatch star Alexandra Paul, who played Lt. Stephanie Holden . Today: Michael Newman, now aged 59, is battling Parkinson's Disease.  A trained lifeguard and firefighter, he ended up being the technical advisor on Baywatch and appeared in 159 episodes . Despite his long history on Baywatch - Newmie appeared on 159 episodes - he would never quite make it to stardom - or achieve the same pay as the show stars. He says: ‘The ratings went up, and then the ratings came down. And as the ratings came down, their way of fixing that problem was by firing everybody and getting a whole new crew, and one of the best ways to do that is to get the hell out of town, so that’s when they took the show to Hawaii.' And he smiles: ‘To give you an idea of the kind of money I made, I bought a property next door to my house and renovated it and sold it. ‘I made more money building that one spec house than I made in all the years that I worked on Baywatch. If I hadn’t been wasting my time on Baywatch and had been building spec houses instead, I would have made some real money.’ Fit: Michael Newman, a trained firefighter and lifeguard, subjected all new cast members to his boot camp as he says none of them were fit enough for the series! Star: Pamela Anderson had her breakout role on Baywatch as C.J. Parker. Michael Newman says his show pay rate was 'quite a bit less' than hers . He continued: ‘The way I was treated on Baywatch, they didn’t give me a lot of respect and it would have been real easy for them to thank me, but for the seven years I was a screen actor, I got paid the absolute legal minimum, which when I started was like $350 per day. ‘I have no idea what it is now, and it’s obviously gone up since then, but just the stinginess and the lack of grace on the show wasn’t great. My rate was quite a bit less than Pamela’s. I have no idea what she was on, she may have been up at the $60-80k mark, where other girls on the show were on $1,000 an episode, so that could be seen as quite disrespectful, but it didn’t really have to be that way.’ Similarly, he says, some of the actresses would only end up making $50,000-a-year, when the taxman took his slice. After Baywatch, Newmie became of one of Hollywood’s leading water star trainers. Copied: The final scene on the Baywatch teaser tape shows Newman standing against the sunset - an image copied on Baywatch's titles . He trained Ashton Kutcher in The Guardian, Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks for his role in Angels and Demons. However, Newmie, married to his wife Sarah with two children, is now battling Parkinson’s Disease. He was diagnosed in 2011 after seeking help for a tremor in his leg and is retired, dividing his time between homes in Hawaii and the Pacific Palisades, California. He says: ‘I suffer with the shaking and get tremors, I also don’t walk very well due to an accident I had a few years before I got Parkinson’s and although I had the foot treated it was always weak, and now the Parkinson’s just makes worse. He adds: ‘But as soon as I step into the ocean, I don’t feel like I have Parkinson’s. I can still swim, surf and enjoy the life I love and know.'

I don't want him to be serious. I would want him to play the role tongue-in-cheek. If they want to do comedy, then they can do comedy. But if they're going to do a lifeguard movie, it better show some respect towards the profession of lifeguards in some way. I'm not asking for much.’ Newmie’s charity work is done with the Cedars Sinai Regenerative Medicine Institute and he works closely with Dr Clive Svendsen, PhD, who is the Director of Regenerative Medicine Institute.

"At 106 Betty Lowe refuses to let the cold weather and her failing eyesight stop her from keeping the Girl Guide promise she took almost a century ago to do all she can to help others. And now Britain's oldest Girl Guide has received the ultimate accolade - an honour from Prime Minister David Cameron. The centenarian is still volunteering and will be given a Point of Light Award, which recognises those who make an exceptional difference to their community. And she shows no signs of stopping, saying the award is a 'big honour.' Betty Lowe says she has no plans to retire and has been rewarded for her work in the community, which has seen her volunteering to help others for almost 100 years since she joined Girl Guides in 1919 at age 11 (right) 'I have no plans to retire,' said Ms Lowe. 'My sight isn't very good, but I can use my hands. As long as I can keep volunteering, I will.' Ms Lowe joined the Girl Guides in 1919 when she was 11 and is still a member. She is currently volunteering at a cafe at Salford Royal Hospital with the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS), which she joined more than 40 years ago. She added: 'I really enjoy volunteering. I would be lost if I didn't come to the hospital to volunteer. 'It's something to occupy my mind. I enjoy the company and you meet people here who you would not normally meet. Ms Lowe pictured in her early 30s digging on a Salford allotment used by the Girl Guides during World War Two . After 95 years as a Girl Guide the pensioner now volunteers at a cafe at Salford hospital once a week . 'It keeps me from being lonely and I don't like being lonely. 'There might be one or two days in winter when I can't come, but I won't let anything stop me.' The Point of Light is not Ms Lowe's first award, as she was honoured with an MBE in 86. Ms Lowe has vowed not to let anything stop her . She added: 'This award is a big honour for me. It's nice to know that other people are thinking of me.' Ms Lowe, who never married, volunteers at the hospital once a week, providing company and support for elderly patients and visitors. She worked her way up from Girl Guide leader to become Vice President of Girlguiding in Greater Manchester West. She also trained leaders and promoted the growth of the guide movement in Salford. Mr Cameron said: 'Betty is an incredible woman, who has dedicated her life to volunteering. As an RVS volunteer for 40 years and as a Guide for 95 years, Betty has lived and breathed serving others.' The pensioner is believed to be Salford's oldest resident. Hazel Blears, MP for Salford and Eccles, said: 'I know everyone in Salford will be thrilled her hard work has been recognised at the highest level. 'She's a real inspiration.'","Betty Lowe has been a Girl Guide for 95 years after taking promise in 1919 .

"Atletico Madrid were beaten at home to Villarreal on Sunday with an 85th minute strike from Luciano Vietto. The 21-year-old striker broke past Diego Godin and placed the ball beyond Miguel Angel Moya sixminutes from time in a game that Diego Simeone's side struggled to get a grip of. The result means the defending La Liga champions were unable to capitalise upon Barcelona's goalless draw with Getafe on Saturday.

Villarreal were denied a penalty in the first half when Gabi appeared to nudge the ball out of the way of Ikechukwu Uche on the stroke of half time with his arm. In truth Atletico had the better of the chances, but Villareal denied them too many clear-cut opportunities during a lack-lustre first half. And the visitors began the second half spiritedly, as the lively Vietto ran at Atletico's defence on 52 minutes and shot narrowly wide from the edge of the area.

"The new wife of Hollywood superstar George Clooney said yesterday that Greece has ‘just cause’ in its fight for the return of the Elgin Marbles. And lawyer Amal Clooney claimed Britain should be embarrassed about how some works of the 5th-century B.C. Parthenon Sculptures have been split between London and Athens. Mrs Clooney is part of a high profile legal team from London advising the Greek government on possible action in the international court to force the British Museum to hand over the marbles. Scroll down for video . Amal Alamuddin Clooney and president of the Acropolis museum Dimitris Pantermalis inspect some of the marble sculptures still left in Greece . Surrounded by the kind of media frenzy normally reserved for her husband, she told a packed press conference in Athens it was an ‘injustice’ that the works of art had not been returned. ‘The Greek government has just cause and it’s time for the British Museum to recognise that and return them to Greece,’ she declared. ‘The injustice has persisted for too long. ‘The Greek government has the right to ask for the return of the marbles, 200 years after they were taken to the United Kingdom,’ she told the gathering at the Acropolis Museum where Greece displays the friezes that it kept when Lord Elgin took half of them in the early 1800s. Admiration: Amal is guided around the Acropolis museum to look at some of the classical pieces of sculpture . The fact that individual friezes had been split between London and Athens should be embarrassing to the British Museum, she continued, highlighting an example of the figure of a horseman, whose head is in Athens and body in London. ‘That means that nobody can celebrate the marbles united, in the place that they came from,’ she said. Mrs Clooney, who married the Hollywood heart-throb in Venice last month, said she and the respected, veteran human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC, had first been asked by the Greeks for advice on the contentious issue in 2011. ‘It is sad to note that three years later, one of the most beautiful pieces of art in the world has still not been reunited for everyone to behold,’ said Mrs Clooney. Fellow lawyer Norman Palmer said he hoped a ‘conciliatory and amicable resolution’ could be found. Mrs Clooney said she became involved in the 'just cause' of returning the Elgin Marbles to Greece three years ago, and described it as 'sad' that no progress had yet been made . ‘If it cannot, then other considerations will have to be examined,’ he added. Greece has delighted in the celebrity of Mrs Clooney – yesterday she met with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras - and her association with the long-running dispute is certain to raise its profile. After more than a century of fruitless lobbying, Greece is now pinning its hopes of reclaiming the sculptures from Britain on a mediation effort backed by the U.N. cultural agency and advised by the London-based lawyers. Culture Minister Costas Tassoulas said yesterday UNESCO has urged Britain to consider a year-old mediation proposal to resolve the world’s most famous heritage dispute. The marble sculptures were removed to Britain - illegally, according to Greece - from the Parthenon temple on the Acropolis in the early 19th century. The British Museum, where they are displayed, and the British government say the works are better off in London. International debate: Amal with Geoffrey Robertson (L) and Greek Culture Minister Konstantinos Tasoulas . Mr Tassoulas has played down taking the issue to the international court. The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, removed the Parthenon Marble sculptures from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803. In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon and his agents removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum. They were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting. They were bought by the British Government to be displayed in the British Museum. Mrs Clooney told a packed news conference that the British Museum should be 'embarrassed' that individual friezes had been split so viewers in neither country could fully enjoy them . The marble sculptures were removed to Britain from the Parthenon temple on the Acropolis in the early 19th century - illegally, according to Greece . George Clooney himself backed the campaign earlier this year, when asked by a reporter at the Berlin Film Festival. ‘I think you have a very good case to make about your artefacts,’ he said. ‘Maybe it wouldn’t be a bad thing if they were returned. That is a good idea, a fair thing to do.’ A video presentation watched by the 1.2 million tourists who visit the Acropolis Museum each year describes the ‘systematic looting of the Parthenon, especially by Lord Elgin.’ The British diplomat ‘proceeded to violently remove and carry off much of the sculpture,’ the documentary explains. ‘The stone blocks were too heavy to carry away so Elgin’s team used iron bars to detach the friezes’” said the museum official. ‘By just taking the most beautiful, sculpted part, he ruined the whole block each time.’ The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, removed the Parthenon Marble sculptures from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire .","Mrs Clooney says Greece has 'just cause' in argument to get marbles back .

"A Coalition row has broken out over terror laws as David Cameron prepares to set out new counter-terrorism measures. Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown - a long-standing ally of current leader Nick Clegg - has denounced the Conservative's 'knee jerk' response to the jihadi terror threat level after it was raised from 'substantial' to 'severe'. But Tory Defence Secretary Michael Fallon today denied the claims and said the country faced 'very real threats' amid warnings the UK's defences against jihadis from Britain and western Europe needed to be stiffened up. Former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown, pictured, has questioned the Tory response to the terror threat level. Hitting out at the Tory response, Lord Ashdown claimed ministers including Mr Cameron had set out to frighten people in an effort to secure support for new powers. Changes will be announced by the Prime Minister in a Commons statement tomorrow, after a weekend of discussions with the Liberal Democrats about the details of the package. It is understood the measures under consideration would make it easier to remove people's passports through temporary seizure powers at the border in order to prevent them travelling to the Middle East trouble zones. Officials are also looking at the prospect of a 'temporary bar' on British citizens suspected of terrorist activity abroad returning, a measure which would stop short of stripping them of citizenship and rendering them stateless. The package could also include beefed-up powers under the terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) regime. There have been calls, including from the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation David Anderson, for the ability to impose 'internal exile' on suspects, a key part of the old control orders regime, to be restored. David Cameron is set to announce counter-terrorism measures in a Commons statement tomorrow . Mr Fallon told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News: 'These are very real threats. We have had Tube trains blown up, London buses, Glasgow Airport attacked, a soldier murdered in broad daylight. 'These are very real threats we are dealing with. 'This isn't any kind of knee-jerk response. The Prime Minister made clear on Friday we need to be calm and measured about the way that we do this. 'But when we look at our current instruments, our armoury of things or how we deal with these threats, there are some gaps. 'We've had a number of young men going off to fight in Syria, a number of them slipping back home again. 'We need to make sure that, where we can, we plug those existing gaps and the Prime Minister is going to go into more details about that to Parliament tomorrow.' Several hundred British nationals are estimated to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State (IS) uprising, and other western European countries have also been a source of foreign fighters. Mr Fallon said the risk posed by returning jihadis from across Europe underlined the need for international action. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, pictured, said the country faced 'very real threats' 'This is now a threat to western Europe generally. This is going on on our doorstep and this does involve us, because these are fighters who can return from Syria and Iraq to western Europe. 'We are all involved in this, this is why we have to do it on a co-ordinated European level. 'We have the Nato summit in Wales taking place later this week and we have to do this collectively, it's not just for one country on its own.' Indicating that changes would be made to Tpims, Mr Fallon said the main problem with the previous control orders regime was that it ran into trouble with judges, rather than Lib Dem opposition to the measures. He said: 'The major problem with control orders has been the courts, actually, it hasn't been the Liberal Democrats, it's been the courts wanting to make sure people aren't being detained unnecessarily if they are not actually being charged. 'But we are now looking at all these things. We have to stiffen up our defences now, we have to take this threat seriously.' He said there were 'people who we know want to do this country harm, we know want to carry out attacks on members of our armed forces or on shopping centres or whatever it is' and 'we need to do more to stop them'. Lord Ashdown, writing in The Observer, said politicians should not act as 'cheerleaders' for the demands of the intelligence and security services. And he warned that the Prime Minister's rhetoric risked alienating moderate Muslims. Lord Ashdown has criticised the David Cameron's rhetoric about the struggle against Islamist extremism . He said the threat of terrorism had been faced before 'effectively, without panic and without a whole new range of executive powers that could endanger our liberties'. Any changes must be 'evidence based, careful of our liberties and sensitive to the need to keep moderate Islam on our side', Lord Ashdown said. The peer criticised the Prime Minister's rhetoric about the struggle against Islamist extremism: 'He recently told us that this fight was about defending 'Western values'. I cannot think of any phrase, short of those used by George Bush during the Iraq war, which more damages our ability to win this battle.' Labour's former minister Hazel Blears, who sits on the Intelligence and Security Committee, called for the return of some of the powers available under control orders. She told Murnaghan: 'Many of these extremists are based in London. So it was possible under control orders to relocate somebody to Ipswich or to Norwich. 'That meant both the police could keep a better eye on them but also they weren't part of that organisation that was plotting against us. I think that was a really useful power. 'When the legislation went through Parliament I almost pleaded with the Home Secretary to keep that power. So if the Prime Minister's going to bring that back, I think it's a very good thing.' She added: 'If the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister have second thoughts, and Nick Clegg decides to get off this high horse that he is on and do something practical to protect the British people, then this is something that I think would help.'","David Cameron is preparing to set out new counter-terrorism measures .

"David Cameron will today be accused of leading Britain to the EU exit door where it will not retain even ‘marginal relevance’ on the world stage. In a highly provocative speech, Jose Manuel Barroso will attack Britain’s ‘defensive’ leaders for failing to ‘make the positive case’ for continued membership of the EU, insisting: ‘Could the UK get by without a little help from your friends? My answer is probably not.’ The intervention by the outgoing head of the European Commission reflects growing fury in Brussels at the increasingly strident anti-EU tone being adopted by Mr Cameron and his ministers. Scroll down for video . Interview: Jose Manuel Barroso, the outgoing head of the European Commission, appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme yesterday . Yesterday Grant Shapps, Tory party chairman, insisted reform was achievable and attacked Mr Barroso as an ‘unelected bureaucrat’. Mr Cameron, who has pledged to hold an in/out referendum on Britain’s EU membership by 2017 if he wins the general election, will set out plans to limit the number of European migrants joining the workforce within the next few weeks, according to Government sources. He is considering an ‘emergency brake’ that could be applied if numbers of incomers exceeded forecasts, and further curbs on low-skilled EU migrants’ rights to benefits, tax credits and national insurance numbers. Though there is growing support for reform in Germany, the Prime Minister is being warned by EU officials that fundamental changes to the right to free movement across the continent would require full-scale changes to the EU treaties that will be all but impossible to deliver. Anti-EU tone: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured with Mr Barroso in Brussels in March) will be accused of leading Britain to the EU exit door where it will not retain even 'marginal relevance' on the world stage . Yesterday Mr Barroso insisted an arbitrary cap on EU immigration would be incompatible with EU law and condemned Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond’s suggestion last week that Britain was ‘lighting a fire’ under the EU by proposing a referendum. ‘I think this reference to fires and weapons is more appropriate for defence than foreign secretary,’ the European Commission boss told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme, a reference to Mr Hammond’s previous Cabinet job. ‘I think it is very important to have a positive tone between Britain and the EU.’ In today’s speech at Chatham House, the foreign affairs think tank, he will tell Mr Cameron that it is never possible to ‘win a debate from the defensive’. ‘We saw in Scotland that you actually need to go out and make the positive case. In the same way, if you support continued membership of the EU you need to say what Europe stands for and why it is in the British interest to be part of it,’ he will add. Mr Barroso said yesterday he could not comment on proposals for reform of immigration rules that had not yet been unveiled by Mr Cameron. Referencing his previous job: The suggestion by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured) last week that Britain was ‘lighting a fire’ under the EU by proposing a referendum was condemned by Mr Barroso . But he added: ‘What I can tell you is that any kind of arbitrary cap seems to be not in conformity with European laws. For us it is very important – the principle of non-discrimination. ‘By the way, I remember when Prime Minister Cameron called me to ask the commission to be tough ensuring the freedom of movement between Gibraltar and Spain. ‘The British citizens have freedom of movement all over Europe. There are 700,000 living in Spain. So the principle of the freedom of movement is essential, we have to keep it.’ In today’s speech the EU boss, who will be replaced shortly by arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker, will accept there were ‘widespread concerns in the UK and elsewhere about abuse of free movement rights’. He will point out some changes – such as the right to receive income support – have already been agreed, but insist further changes must be agreed by all countries and cannot put into question the ‘basic right’ of free movement. Interviewed by Andrew Marr: Yesterday Mr Barroso (right) insisted an arbitrary cap on EU immigration would be incompatible with EU law . He will also warn Britain its current rhetoric is offending eastern European countries. Mr Barroso will dismiss the idea of a European ‘superstate’ but insist: ‘Today even the largest, proudest European nation cannot hope to shape globalisation – or even retain marginal relevance – by itself.’ Pointing to Mr Cameron’s current attempt to persuade fellow EU leaders to contribute £800million to curb the spread of ebola, he added yesterday. ‘What would be the influence of the prime minister of Britain if he was not part of the EU? It would be zero. Inside the EU you can get much more than outside the EU.’ Mr Shapps said Mr Barroso was ‘out of touch with the mainstream’s view in Great Britain, which is – it’s time to have a different relationship with Europe’. He brushed aside Mr Barroso’s warnings about reform, saying he was ‘only the latest person from Europe to tell us we’ll never get what we want’.","European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso will attack leaders .

"Barack Obama will today outline his plan to ‘degrade and destroy’ Islamic State insurgency in both Syria and Iraq – on the 13th anniversary of 9/11. The US President is to announce his long-awaited strategy for dealing with Islamic State militants in a rare primetime televised address this morning, just hours before commemorations of the terror attacks on New York and Washington. In a statement ahead of his speech, White House officials said the US is planning to arm and train Syrian forces while stepping up air strikes on jihadis in Iraq – and possibly Syria. Scroll down for video . Plans: President Obama, was pictured, right, discussing his plans to beat ISIS wth House Speaker John Boehner, left . Baghdad bound: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reads on a flight en route to Iraq on Wednesday on a visit to the Middle East to discuss ways to bolster the stability of the new Iraqi government and combat ISIS . Talks: Kerry will urge newly-installed Haider al-Abadi to unite the rival factions in his country - as well as offering U.S. help to tackle ISIS . They went on to say that the US is planning to pursue ‘a comprehensive strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy’ the Islamic organisation. The US is already launching air strikes against IS targets inside Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government. But the mission’s scope has been limited to strikes that help protect American interests in the region and prevent humanitarian crises. Mr Obama has said that while he ‘has the authority he needs to take action’ against the Islamic State militants, he would welcome backing from Congress that would ‘aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the United States is united in defeating the threat.’ US officials said Mr Obama is expected to loosen those limitations and open a broader counter-terrorism campaign against militants in Iraq. Vision: Kerry looks out over Baghdad from a helicopter ahead of his arrival for the crucial meetings . Weight of the world: Kerry arrived in Baghdad as Obama prepares to make his prime time speech that will set out his plan on how to respond to the threat posed by ISIS . And following the beheading of two American journalists in Syria, Mr Obama, pictured, began considering extending strikes into Syria. The President’s spokesman said he will go ‘wherever is necessary to strike those threatening Americans’. Polls show the American people support a sustained air campaign. Currently 71 per cent support air strikes in Iraq, up from 54 per cent just three weeks ago. And 65 per cent say they support extending air strikes into Syria. However officials said the extent of America’s commitment is likely to be determined by the level of military and political backing they receive from Europe and the Middle East. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in the Middle East to get support for action against IS, met new Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi yesterday and said he was ‘encouraged’ by his plans for political and military reform. Mr al-Abadi formed a unity government this week to fight IS rebels’ advance in northern Iraq. Efforts to root out the militant group will focus on bolstering the capacity of Iraqi security forces and the Syrian opposition, as the President has so far ruled out sending US ground troops into combat. And plans to give Iraq’s law-abiding Sunnis more control over their local power structures and security forces are also expected to play a crucial role in calming tensions. Political solution: Kerry listens as new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi. The Obama administration has said that ISIS will not be defeated by military action alone. Kerry said after the meeting he was impressed by the premier's plans to rebuild the Iraqi military and push broad political reforms . Britain has already drawn-up extensive plans to support the US that includes airstrikes and UK Special Forces forming ‘advisory’ training teams to instruct Kurdish fighters how to use heavy machine guns ‘gifted’ by Britain this week. Military commanders are said to be preparing to present the UK’s plan in support of the US to David Cameron within days, and it will include Tornado and Typhoon aircraft as well as an option to use troops in a limited role. An Aviation Task Force of Chinook helicopters has been placed on high readiness to move to the region together with Typhoons and a further Royal Signals satellite communications squadron, that would support future operations. Planners at the operational headquarters have been working closely with their US counterparts at US Central Command in Florida to establish where UK assets and resources can best be directed. The UK’s mission, codenamed Operation Shader, has already involved a combined force of hundreds of Special Forces working closely with Kurdish fighters as well as identifying targets for US fighter aircraft. Warmongers: ISIS has seized huge amounts of territory in Iraq and Syria. They are pictured above in a position won from the Iraqi government's army . Fighters: Pictured above are members of the Kurdish Peshmerga military fighting ISIS . This week Toyota jeeps, now used by the SAS as they can be repaired in almost any country, were delivered to the Kurdish city of Irbil by two RAF C-17 aircraft, as special forces units prepare their role, currently described by the Ministry of Defence as ‘liaison teams’. Typhoon aircraft, which first flew in action over Libya in 2012, are on standby to deliver Paveway laser guided bunker busters to degrade IS’s military capability and six aircraft are in Cyprus. According to officials, at least 600 troops will also be on standby to move into Irbil, should they be needed as part of a protection force or to provide additional training. Two more forward operating bases may be established in the Middle East with an increased presence in Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates all under consideration. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the advance of Islamic State poses a ‘clear and immediate’ threat to British national security. But in a Commons debate, he said there was a ‘qualitative difference’ between carrying out air strikes in Iraq and Syria. He told MPs: ‘The legal, technical and military differences make the proposition of air strikes more complicated in Syria.’","Obama will announce a long-awaited strategy in an address to the nation .

"Military chiefs warned Britain would struggle to mount a lengthy air campaign against Islamic State because the RAF has been reduced to the ‘bare bones’ by defence cuts. Former head of the RAF, Air Chief Marshall Sir Michael Graydon, said the RAF was at rock bottom after years of cuts. Six RAF Tornados will spearhead Britain’s operations against Islamic State over Iraq with a blitz on carefully chosen targets that is expected to last for many months. Scroll down for video . A Tornado taking off at RAF Marham, Norfolk, today. .The planes are believed to be on their way to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus to help with the possible air strikes against jihadist extremists in Iraq . Six RAF Tornado jets will begin strikes on targets in Iraq from a base in Cyprus within hours of MPs giving their approval . But Sir Michael, a former Chief of the Air Staff, said the RAF was already committed to defending UK air space as well as operations in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and the Falklands. ‘The lack of combat aircraft is a major weakness,’ he said. ‘This has been raised time and time again and basically ignored. We really are at rock bottom. To sustain this operation is going to be quite a stretch.’ Air Commodore Andrew Lambert added: ‘I think it’s do-able, but we are really scraping the bottom of the barrel, so let’s hope Ukraine doesn’t bubble up into something nasty.’ Six RAF Tornados have been stationed in Cyprus for the past six weeks and have been flying surveillance flights over northern Iraq. They could begin dropping bombs and missiles within hours of the Prime Minister giving orders. The pilots are already familiar with the way IS moves and have a number of potential fixed targets . Further Tornados are on standby to be moved to the region . Their pilots are already familiar with the way IS moves and have a number of potential fixed targets such as command and control bunkers and barracks. Operating from the giant RAF base Akrotiri in Cyprus, the two-seater fighter bombers will be armed with Paveway 500lb, 1,000lb and 2,000lb bombs to target small compounds, Storm Shadow bunker busters and supersonic Brimstone missiles that can hit moving targets such as enemy fighters in cars or on motorbikes. Further Tornados are on standby to be moved to the region, while an Astute-class Royal Navy submarine carrying Tomahawk cruise missiles is already in place and is likely to be ‘operational’ in the first waves of attacks.

"British militants are using a sophisticated ‘dead letter box’ system to smuggle their way into Syria and Iraq to fight for Islamic State. Terrorist handlers are employing ‘silent’ email addresses that never actually send messages, but instead contain instructions in the ‘drafts’ folder. Would-be fighters are then moved from Europe undetected across the Turkish border to training camps in Syria. Trail to terror: One man crosses the porous border between Turkey and Syria. An estimated 500 Britons have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight and more than 250 are thought to have returned to the UK . Turkish authorities believe up to 20 Britons are currently waiting in safe houses or hotels for the signal to cross over into Syria. They are among around 100 foreign militants that Turkey says are suspected of being in a network of IS buildings waiting to be told they should move on. Intelligence officers warn there has been an alarming increase in the number of ‘volunteers’ travelling from the UK since the IS proclaimed it has established a caliphate stretching from Syria into Iraq. With more than 250 extremists said to have returned to the UK – 200 of them to London – anti-terror specialists are involved in an exhaustive operation to examine the entry records of all Britons entering Turkey with a £20 visa bought on arrival. They are cross-checking those who have left, how long they stayed and whether they have overstayed the 90-day period of their visa, in a bid to identify who may be in Syria, and who may have returned to the UK. Some are said to be trading passports with fellow fighters of similar age and appearance to use when leaving Turkey, in order to confuse the security services. Threat: An IS fanatic waves the terror group's flag in Raqqa, Syria. The group uses sophisticated system allows handlers to pass on information to recruits without leaving an electronic hallmark . Intelligence agencies have learned  would-be jihadists waiting in safe houses are given a password to a free email address, which they access once a day to find instructions left for them as draft messages. Recruits are told they must never send any emails from the account, but merely read the drafts, then delete them. The sophisticated system allows handlers to pass on information without leaving an electronic hallmark. According to officials in Ankara, the passwords are changed on a regular basis to ensure the users are not tracked – and in case any new recruits are actually sleeper agents for the security services. Radical: Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary from London is among the Britons thought to be fighting in Syria . An estimated 500 Britons have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight. Some believe the figure could be twice as high when including residents who are also foreign nationals. Communications monitoring and analysis by specialists both inside Iraq and at GCHQ, the Government’s spy headquarters in Cheltenham, is said to have provided further evidence relating to Britons joining the IS jihad. A year ago, potential recruits would travel to Syria from the UK to Turkey, often either as tourists on holiday packages to Istanbul or Ankara. Now they are travelling via one or two other countries in a bid to avoid suspicion at air and sea ports. Militants are told to travel to central European countries such as Germany, Hungary, Serbia or Bosnia, wait a few days and then travel on, preferably by road or train, to Turkey. News of IS’s complicated methods emerged amid reports that murdered journalist James Foley was waterboarded during his time as the jihadists’ prisoner. The American’s captors – believed to be British – appeared to model their technique on that of the CIA, which waterboarded three terrorism suspects captured after the September 11. The torture  involves captives having water poured over their noses and mouths until they feel as if they are suffocating, or being plunged beneath the water in a bath. Yesterday Home Secretary Theresa May announced the terror threat to the UK has been raised from substantial to severe meaning a terrorist attack in ‘highly likely’, as David Cameron unveiled plans to strip terror suspects of their passports.","British militants use sophisticated system to get into Syria undetected .

"America is poised to ask Britain to support air strikes against jihadi positions in northern Iraq, it was reported last night. The White House believes the UK and Australia would be willing to join in such an air campaign, according to the New York Times. And it claimed officials are on the point of asking the Prime Minister – as well as leaders of a string of other countries including Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and Australia – about it.

Leaders: Barack Obama (left) is said to be on the point of asking David Cameron (right) - as well as leaders of other countries including Qatar and Australia - if they would be willing to join in such an air campaign . However, Downing Street sources said yesterday no request from the Obama administration had yet been made, and that UK involvement in air strikes would need ‘a lot of discussion first’. Parliament is expected to debate the issue when it returns on Monday. The Prime Minister has previously indicated that any military action would have to be approved by MPs. Britain is already supplying intelligence, surveillance and support from Special Forces as well as refuelling facilities to warplanes. But taking part in air strikes would mark a major escalation. It is also currently preparing to join the .

As the UK announced a further £10million worth of aid to Iraq, senior defence planners were asked to ‘scope’ how a mission to ease the plight of those stranded could be launched. It would be likely to follow US air strikes on Islamic State (IS) positions and involve both special forces and RAF Hercules transport planes operating out of Cyprus. It is feared IS has ground-to-air missiles capable of bringing down an aircraft. Nickolay Mladenov, the UN special . representative for Iraq, has said the situation in Amerli ‘demands . immediate action to prevent the possible massacre of its citizens’ while . community leaders have warned of a ‘catastrophe'.

Supporters: Demonstrators are pictured chanting their support for Islamic State (IS) as they wave al-Qaida flags in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul, 225 miles northwest of Baghdad, Iraq . Soldiers: Armed with guns, Kurdish Peshmerga forces are seen sweeping the Bakirta village near the town of Makhmur, south of Erbil, Kurdistan, yesterday after Islamic State (IS) insurgents withdrew from the village . A UN report said public executions, mock crucifixions, whippings and amputations are being regularly carried out as part of a chilling campaign of fear and intimidation by the militants. The jihadists responsible for the murder of US journalist James Foley were also found to be forcing boys as young as ten to join up and using teenagers in suicide attacks while boys of 15 are being beheaded publicly. Investigators say that women have been publicly lashed for not following the group’s strict dress code and some stoned to death after allegations of infidelity. The shocking chronicle of atrocities and torture are included in a report by the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights which paints a disturbing and bleak picture of all sides in the Syrian civil war, accusing the regime of Bashar al-Assad of repeatedly using chemical weapons against civilians. Horrific: The jihadists responsible for the murder of US journalist James Foley, which was captured on video (pictured), were also found to be forcing boys as young as ten to join up and using teenagers in suicide attacks . It says that both the militants and the Assad regime are committing war crimes. ‘Executions in public spaces have become a common spectacle on Fridays’ in Raqqa, the Syrian city that has become IS’s stronghold and is now the focus of US spy planes, the report said. ‘Children have been present at the executions, which take the form of beheading or shooting in the head at close range … Bodies are placed on public display, often on crucifixes, for up to three days, serving as a warning to local residents.’ In the 45-page report, the panel described beheadings of boys aged 15, men flogged for smoking or accompanying an ‘improperly dressed’ female relative. The report said: ‘Women have been lashed . for not abiding by IS’s dress code.

A spokesman said: ‘Among the most disturbing findings in this report are accounts of large training camps where children, mostly boys from the age of 14, are recruited and trained to fight in the ranks of ISIS along with adults,’ he said. ‘We are aware of the presence of children in training camps, I think that this decision by the United States must respect the laws of war and we are concerned about the presence of these children.’ The report, compiled after six months of investigations, came as IS supporters tweeted pictures allegedly showing militants executing Syrian army soldiers after capturing the government Tabqa airbase near Raqqa in eastern Syria. The pictures have not been verified. Trapped: Any humanitarian aid drops would be similar to those flown by the RAF to members of the Yazidi community trapped two weeks ago on the Sinjar mountains. Above, Yazidi women on the mountains . The commission was created three years ago by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate abuses committed in the war, in which 200,000 people in Syria are estimated to have died. It will present to the council next month its latest report covering a litany of war crimes and crimes against humanity it says were carried out by the Syrian government, Islamic State and other opposition groups. Many fighters from Syria’s weakened rebel battalions are defecting to Islamic State ‘owing to the latter’s superior financial and operational capabilities,’ it warns. Among the allegations of war crimes committed by the Syrian government was the use of suspected chlorine gas, a chemical agent, in eight separate incidents in April and May of this year. The report also detailed the use of barrel bombs by the Syrian Air Force which were dropped on civilian neighbourhoods. Deaths in custody in Syrian jails are on the rise and forensic analysis of 26,948 photographs allegedly taken from 2011-2013 in government detention centres back its ‘longstanding findings of systematic torture and deaths of detainees’.","America is poised to ask Britain to support air strikes, it has been claimed .

"A talented cricketer with 'the world at his feet', Phillip Hughes is being mourned in Australia and around the world following his death from a brain injury two days after being struck in the head by a bouncer. The son of banana farmer from the northern New South Wales town of Macksville, he was dropped from the Australian Test team five times but never gave up and is being remembered for his defiant attitude in the face of adversity. 'Hughesy' or 'Hugh-dog', as he was nicknamed, was an immensely likeable and also humble, understated and hardworking team mate for the Australian, South Australian and Adelaide Strikers.

As cricketers, friends and family gathered around his bedside at St Vincent's Hospital for the 48 hours following his injury, the prayers and tributes for Hughes - as a cricketer, a mate and a great bloke - poured in. His achievements as a young cricketer - he was due to celebrate his 26th birthday this Sunday - include making 26 first class centuries; as Western Australia coach Justin Langer pointed out this week while flying back to Sydney to see Hughes, at his age, Langer had only made one. Hughes made a total of 15,789 runs in his first class career and many of those were ones or twos - as he laughingly recalled some years ago, he wasn't a big scorer of fours or sixes. The left-handed opener was the son of Greg Hughes, who cleared a patch on his farm for young Phil to practise cricket, and  mother Virginia, who is of Italian origin. Growing up with sister, Megan, and brother, Jason, as a teenager he often helped out hauling heavy bunches of bananas for the family business.

Rugby star Sonny Bill Williams (left) and boxing trainer, Khoder Nasser were  friends of Hughes . As a schoolboy, he was also a talented rugby league player who played alongside another Macksville kid, the future South Sydney Rabbitohs star Greg Inglis. Seven years ago almost to the day, just before his 19th birthday, Hughes made his debut in first-class cricket, securing a spot in the NSW side. As a 20-year-old, he won the the Bradman Young Player of the Year, accepting the award in Melbourne during the Allan Border Medal presentations in February 2009. Since Hughes' stunning 2009 Test debut at the age of 20 in South Africa, he had been dropped five times, which might have defeated a less determined player. But despite controversies over his style, technique and his off-field activities with the friends he keeps, Hughes  always plugged on, taking on the verbal bouncers along with those on the field.

In return the cricketer  sat ringside at Mundine's fights. Hughes walks out of the SCG dressing room on Tuesday to open the batting for South Australia . Prone to periodic run droughts due to a perceived inability to deal with the short ball, Hughes  test average was 32.65. In 2009, after being presented with the Australian Baggy Green cap No 408, he stepped up to the crease for his first Test match, in  South Africa. In that Test series, Hughes became the youngest Australian player in cricketing history to score back-to-back centuries in his debut, which he achieved in the Durban Test, his second. Hughes was selected to play the 2009 Ashes Test series in England, but was dropped when the English bowlers pitched short balls to him in an effort to exploit his weaknesses. But what he may have lacked occasionally in technique, he made up for with heart and drive. In the 2010/2011 Ashes series, selectors  ignored him except as an injury replacement for Simon Katich in the final test; he toured Sri Lanka in late 2011 and scored 126 in the third test. But in the New Zealand tour that summer, poor performances saw him dropped and he signed a contract to play county cricket for Worcestershire in England and work on his technique. In January 2011, Hughes was stunned to be accused of 'cheating' by English cricket legend Sir Ian Botham after being bowled a bouncer in the Sydney Test by Alastair Cook and staying on the field after what was initially thought to be a catch. That year, Hughes decided to move away from his friends and his family in New South Wales to South Australia for the good of his game - and it paid off. Sonny Bill Williams, Anthony Mundine and Khoder Nasser (left to right, pictured) were good friends and supporters of Test cricketer, Phillip Hughes, who has died two days after he was struck in the head by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG . In 2012, he was the Sheffield Shield's highest run scorer and was selected for the 2012-2013 Sri Lankan tour of Australia. He was rumoured to be up for a $1million Cricket Australia contract and in January last year he became the first Australian batsman to score a debut century  in one-day international cricket. Last October, Hughes made his Twenty20 international cricket debut for Australia in the United Arab Emirates, in the same match as Sean Abbott made his. Before his injury at the SCG on Tuesday, he was up for selection in next week's Test against India at the Gabba in Brisbane. He had played 26 Test matches and Australian selector and cricketing legend Rod Marsh described Hughes as 'a hell of a good batsman'. As cricketers, legends of the game and mates said after the news came on Thursday afternoon of Hughes' death: 'his time was just around the corner ... he was about to come into his own'.","Phillip Hughes has died in hospital two days after being struck by bouncer .

"Friends of a young Sydney woman who could face the death penalty in China for allegedly trying to smuggle the drug 'ice' first became worried when she failed to show as a bridesmaid at her best mate's wedding in mid-November. Kalynda Davis, 22, a talented basketballer from Glenmore Park in Sydney's west, will face a Chinese court this week accused of trying to import 75kg of methamphetamine to Australia. She was arrested with Peter Gardner, 25, from Richmond in Sydney's north-west. Kalynda Davis, 22, has been arrested in China for smuggling drugs to Australia . The 22-year-old woman (right), from Sydney's west, was arrested along with Peter Gardner (left), 25 . It is believed they had known each other for just weeks before they flew to Guangzhou on November 5. Friends of Davis told Daily Mail Australia they became concerned when Davis did not appear at the wedding ceremony 10 days later on the afternoon of November 15. Her friends said the drug crime allegations that emerged this week were unbelievable and 'out of character'. In a Facebook conversation seen by Daily Mail Australia, one clearly angered friend of the 22-year-old was enraged at Gardner, her alleged accomplice. 'He took her from us! He deserves nothing! He took our Kalynda and used her,' the friend wrote. 'She would be so scared right now. I just want to hug her.’ A source close to the family confessed it was a stressful time for the Davis family. Worried family members reported her missing on the day she left for China but many of her friends were unaware of her disappearance. Lawyer Paul Blunt told Daily Mail Australia: 'The family just wishes all media outlets respect their privacy at this difficult time.' Another friend of Davis', Blake Tatafu, 22, said he was shocked by the allegations, which were extremely unexpected. Davis' friends hoped for the best and shared the blame in various social media posts. They became concerned when she did not show up as a bridesmaid for her best friend . Davis, (left and right when she was younger) participated in fun runs and fundraising efforts for mental health and cancer campaigns . 'All the allegations, really - it's very out of character for her,' Mr Tatafu, who has known Davis for about a decade, told Daily Mail Australia. 'I don't understand if the allegations were true how they would come about.' Mr Tatafu, who had not talked to Davis for about a month, was stunned when he saw missing posters circulating on social media a fortnight ago, describing his reaction as: ‘Oh s***.' He said if Davis had been seeing Gardner, it would be unusual for her friends not to know. Neighbours of the Davis family mirrored Mr Tatafu's shock at the news. The Davis family live in a large double storey brick home with a pool at the back of a golf course in Glenmore Park, a wealthy pocket of Sydney's greater west, which is home to many young families. One neighbour who preferred not to be named told Daily Mail Australia he had only kind words to say about the family. The family's patriarch, dad Larry, is an ANZ mobile insurance broker who operates in the city's far west. 'They're a genuinely good family,' the neighbour said. 'They really are. When my son told me she was on the news, I hadn't even heard of it.' 'Kalynda was an amazing girl she just got herself into the wrong crowd,' one friend said . Davis, who studied at Penrith Anglican School, was very active on Instagram and had many friends in Sydney's outer west. Mr Tatafu said she was a keen community advocate who had participated in fun runs and fundraising efforts for mental health and cancer campaigns. 'If I could tell her anything is to ""Stay strong, it's going to be very tough times ahead. Remember you still have family and friends who love you back home"",' he said. As for Gardner, his friends said he had been doing well for himself until the drug charges. The muscular 25-year-old with blond hair was also reported missing the day he flew to Guangzhou. One mate wrote on Facebook: 'He was doing so so well for himself as well, and now this!' Another friend, Brad King, told Daily Mail Australia in a statement: 'He was actually a really genuine bloke who would do anything for his mates.' On November 8, three days after the pair arrived in Guangzhou, Davis and Gardner were apprehended by Chinese authorities at the airport, 9News reported. The pair  booked their seats on the plane at the Flight Centre at a nearby shopping centre, the broadcaster said. Kalynda Davis, pictured here at a younger age, is one of two people who are facing drug charges in China . A New South Wales police spokeswoman said they had referred to the matter to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as soon as Davis was located overseas. A number of Australians have been detained overseas on drug charges in recent times. The most infamous of these cases is that of convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby, who served nine years in an Indonesian prison. Some have been put to death, including Vietnamese Australian Van Tuong Nguyen, who was hung for drug trafficking on December 2, 2005. According to U.S. human rights groups, China is the world's biggest executioner, having put 2,400 people to death in 2013 alone. Ice is an increasingly popular drug in Australia, with the number of drug users who take the substance increasing significantly in 2014 - from 55 per cent in 2013 to 61 per cent in the six months leading to October this year, according to the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre. The man who gave Gardner his apprenticeship, builder Michael Kulakovski, said he was deeply concerned for the young man's future. 'To be caught with substance in China is probably one of the worst countries to be caught in,' Mr Kulakovski told 9News. 'He was doing really good, he had a lot of work and he was earning good money. [I] don't know why he's done this.' One of Davis' friends expressed a similar sentiment. 'Please don't let anyone portray her as something she's not,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'She's the most fun, loving, beautiful girl and so full of life. She just made the biggest mistake of her life.' Davis and Gardner's case were expected to be heard by a Chinese court later this week.

"Eileen Clark, who lived in the UK for . 16 years after fleeing an allegedly abusive husband, has been extradited . to the US on charges of kidnapping their children . A mother of three who has been living openly in Britain for 16 years after fleeing an allegedly abusive husband has been extradited to the US on charges of kidnapping their children . Eileen Clark, a 57-year-old American citizen living near Oxford, was handed over to US marshals at Heathrow Airport on Thursday. Charged with international parental kidnapping even though her three grown-up children support her, Mrs Clark will face a courtroom confrontation with her husband. Her supporters say it is yet another example of how Britain’s Extradition Act is unfair and is being misused. Liberty, which has represented Mrs Clark, said an emergency injunction to halt her removal had been refused just hours before she was flown to the US on Thursday. Two medical reports had certified that she was unfit to fly but ‘disgracefully, even that evidence wasn’t enough to stop the Home Office from handing her over,’ said Liberty legal officer Emma Norton. The charity said that removing the ‘vulnerable’ and ‘terrified’ woman was a ‘perfect example of how inhuman, unbalanced and unjust our extradition system has become’. Witnesses said she was so distressed that she had to be taken on to the plane in a wheelchair. A Metropolitan Police officer had to intervene when the marshals tried to restrain her for the flight, informing them the Home Secretary had advised against it. A former model, Mrs Clark left her unhappy marriage nearly 20 years ago, first moving to live with friends in California and New Mexico, and later taking her young children to live with her in Britain. Her ex-husband, John Clark, has pursued her in the US courts even though their three offspring – all of whom are now in their 20s – bitterly oppose her extradition. She was originally charged only with ‘custodial interference’ – not a criminal offence in Britain - after leaving her husband in 1995 but, after she instructed a US lawyer, Mrs Clark claimed she had been assured the charge had been dismissed. However, in 2010, she was told she faced extradition the far more serious offence of international parental kidnapping. Eileen Clark, 57, has been charged with international parental kidnapping even though her three grown-up children support her. She is pictured here with children Chandler, 22, far right, Hayden, 20 and Rebekah, 17, left, at home in Oxfordshire . Despite their age, all three children have been labeled ‘endangered adults’ by US authorities, who insist they only discovered she was living in Britain in 2008. The Home Secretary upheld the original extradition order last August but her case returned to court following new human rights submissions and new evidence that Mrs Clark was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of her marriage. Last month, two High Court judges rejected the challenge, saying the PTSD claim was ‘dubious’. Lord Justice Treacy said the removal of children without parental consent was ‘a serious matter’. A Liberty spokesman said Mrs Clark will be held in custody in the US until she can get bail but would have trouble doing so as she has no permanent American address. Mrs Clark was handed over to US marshals at Heathrow Airport, pictured above, on Thursday. Her supports say it is another example of Britain's Extradition Act being misused . Mrs Clark claims the extradition is just part of her ex-husband’s abuse, describing it as ‘his final bid for power and control over me’. Their daughter, Rebekah, said in May: ‘I don’t mean to sound melodramatic but I just think it would be the end of her.’ Mrs Clark claims her ex-husband used to hit her, once threatening to push her down a flight of stairs when she was pregnant. The decision to extradite Mrs Clark was also condemned by the domestic violence charity Refuge. Sandra Horley, its chief executive, said her forced return to the US was a ‘bleak day’ and set ‘an incredibly dangerous precedent’. She said: ‘Eileen alleges that she experienced years of domestic abuse at his hands. It is highly disturbing that her claims have not been properly examined in a court of law in this country. Instead, this terrified woman is being handed back to the States to face criminal charges.'

"Convicted double murderer Joseph Wood was sentenced to death by lethal injection . The last words of convicted double murderer Joseph Wood were to prove pitifully ironic. As doctors inserted IV tubes into his arms in the death chamber at Arizona State Prison in Florence on Wednesday, Wood thanked Jesus as his Saviour — in his own mind at least — and made his peace with the world. Strapped to a wheeled stretcher in an orange prison jumpsuit, he turned his head and grinned at the 20 or so witnesses watching him through a glass window from a small viewing room. They included his lawyers, the family of his victims and the prison chaplain, fingering his rosary as he mouthed silent prayers. ‘I take comfort knowing today my pain stops, and I said a prayer that, on this or any other day, you may find peace in all of your hearts, and may God forgive you all,’ said 55-year-old Wood, signally omitting to apologise for his crimes. ‘Are those your last words?’, asked the prison warden. ‘Yes, sir,’ he replied. As a controversial cocktail of lethal drugs coursed into his veins, Wood closed his eyes and appeared sedated. But whether his pain really had stopped as he expected, or whether he suffered prolonged agony was the subject of a fierce row yesterday. Witnesses said Wood lay snorting and gasping for breath like a landed fish, and experts predicted his last moments may prove a watershed for the American way of execution. For Wood — convicted in 1989 of murdering his estranged girlfriend Debra Dietz and her father Eugene in a shooting — took nearly two hours to die from a procedure that was supposed to kill him in ten to 15 minutes. As Arizona’s governor, Jan Brewer, ordered an independent investigation into why his execution took so long, Department of Correction officials claimed that, although he may have taken a long time to die, there were no signs Wood suffered as he was ‘deeply sedated’ throughout. They insisted the execution had followed protocol, with a doctor checking Wood was deeply under seven times before he was pronounced dead. He didn’t grimace or move throughout, said officials. But independent witnesses begged to differ. Michael Kiefer, a reporter for the Arizona Republic and an official media representative in the viewing room, had witnessed four previous executions. ‘Usually it takes about ten minutes, the person goes to sleep. This was not that,’ he said afterwards. John Zemblidge, right, of Phoenix, leads a group of death penalty opponents in prayer as they protest the  execution of Joseph  Wood at the state prison in Florence, Arizona . Mr Kiefer said it started normally as Wood, who appeared to be smiling slightly, took a few gulps of air and then closed his eyes. Four minutes into the process, a doctor appeared and checked Wood’s pulse and then spoke to witnesses through a microphone to confirm he was sedated. But nine minutes after Wood’s final words, witnesses say it was clear something was wrong. His mouth opened and, three minutes later, it opened again and his chest moved as if he had started to burp. Then, he kept doing it — Mr Kiefer said he counted this chest movement at least 640 times. He and Fox 10 News reporter Troy Hayden exchanged glances and agreed they didn’t think he was ever going to die. Both compared Wood’s breathing to a ‘fish on land gulping for air’. Mr Hayden described the procedure as ‘very disturbing to watch’ also saying that ‘It was tough for everybody in that room’. Mr Kiefer said Wood appeared to be ‘drowning in air’. He added: ‘The movement was like a piston: the mouth opened, the chest rose, the stomach convulsed. And when the doctor came in to check on his consciousness and turned on the microphone to announce that Wood was still sedated, we could hear the sound he was making: a snoring, sucking — similar to when a swimming-pool filter starts taking in air.’ Witnesses said Joseph Wood lay gasping and snorting in his final moments (file picture of a lethal injection chamber) During the procedure, two of Wood’s lawyers left the viewing room and phoned judges — including one in the U.S. Supreme Court — to try to get the execution stopped on the grounds that it breached the U.S. Constitution’s ban on ‘cruel and unusual punishment’. They failed. At last, say witnesses, Wood’s gasping became less frequent, and finally stopped as a doctor re-examined him and stated he was still sedated. At 3.49pm local time, an hour and 57 minutes after the procedure started, Charles Ryan, director of Arizona’s Corrections Department, appeared in the window next to Wood’s stretcher and announced that the execution had been completed. Wood’s lawyer, Dale Baich, said his client had ‘gasped and struggled to breathe for about an hour and 40 minutes’. His next statement was damning: ‘The experiment failed. Arizona appears to have joined several other states who have been responsible for an entirely preventable horror — a bungled execution.’ Death penalty opponents said the worst thing about the prolonged death was that it was ‘entirely predictable and avoidable’. The family of Wood’s victims, who had watched the execution, argued any agony he had gone through had been nothing to what he had inflicted on their relatives. ‘I don’t believe he was suffering. It sounded to me like he was snoring,’ said Jeanne Brown. ‘You don’t know what excruciating is. What’s excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing your sister laying there in a pool of blood. ‘This man deserved it.’ As her comments made all too clear, the case is unlikely to shake many Americans in their backing of the death penalty. Supporters tend to argue no agony in the condemned’s final moments can ever outweigh his or her awful crime. But Wood’s protracted death is expected to have profound implications in the debate about how capital punishment is carried out. Since Texas first used lethal injection for execution in 1982, states have adopted it as a supposedly painless solution. However, the practice has been mired in controversy as supplies of the usual killer barbiturates have run out and executioners — often under-trained jail staff — have been forced to inject alternative drugs. Those used in the Wood execution — a mix of a sedative called midazolam, that is supposed to bring on unconsciousness, and narcotic painkiller hydromorphone, that is designed to shut down breathing and stop the heart — have proved problematic before. Controversy has focused on midazolam in two recent executions. In January, in Ohio the same two drugs took more than 20 minutes to kill Dennis McGuire, as he reportedly gasped, then started making snorting and choking sounds as he clenched his fists. Midazolam was used again in April by Oklahoma prison chiefs putting to death killer Clayton Lockett. Until blinds were lowered to block their view, witnesses said he writhed violently, at one point saying: ‘Man’, before dying after 43 minutes from a heart attack. It is now believed the catheter was placed incorrectly, allowing the lethal drugs to seep into Lockett’s tissue rather than into his veins. This would have meant he was only part-sedated when a final, painful heart-stopping drug was injected. The Arizona state prison where the  execution of Joseph Wood took place . America’s National Institutes of Health has warned side effects of midazolam can include seizures, uncontrollable shaking and breathing problems. And David Waisel, associate professor in anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School, compares the suffering Wood would have endured to the feeling of being punched in the stomach and gasping for air — in his case, for nearly two hours. He blamed a combination of rigid execution rules — that prevent staff responding if the procedure is going wrong — with the fact most of the executioners administering the drugs are unskilled, particularly in the difficult field of anaethesia. ‘With an unsafe system, bad things happen,’ he said yesterday. While doctors check the state of the inmate and attach IV lines, the actual process of administering the lethal dose is left to prison staff. The executioners’ biggest problem now is that many of the most effective drugs — including propofol, the sedative that contributed to Michael Jackson’s death, and another, sodium thiopental — are now only made in Europe. And the European Union, which has banned the death penalty, has told drug companies they cannot export the chemicals to the U.S. if they know they are to be used for lethal injections. In 2010, campaign group Reprieve UK, which opposes capital punishment, discovered two UK companies — Archimedes Pharma UK and Dream Pharma (based in offices above a driving school in west London) — had unwittingly supplied Arizona with execution drugs and business secretary Vince Cable imposed an export ban. The drugs shortage has led some states to suspend executions and others to find back-door methods of getting the chemicals or to find new drugs companies. Facing claims that they are using substandard, impure drugs, prison officials have refused to reveal their new suppliers. Some states, meanwhile, are looking at older execution methods. Tennessee politicians support a return to the electric chair, while a Wyoming senator has demanded firing squads. However, experts predict that neither method is likely to meet the ban on ‘cruel and unusual’ punishment. Campaign group Human Rights Watch has compiled a list of U.S. executions between 1982 and 2006, which it says were ‘botched’. None took as long as that of Wood. Meanwhile, a major poll last year by the Pew Research Center found 55 per cent of American adults favour the death penalty for murder, while 37 per cent oppose it. This is a substantial fall on two years previously when 62 per cent said they supported it. With America at last wavering over capital punishment, could the lingering death of Joseph Wood be the final nail in its coffin?","Convicted double murderer Joseph Wood sentenced to death by lethal injection .

"Comrades recall how Private First Class Bowe Bergdahl had just come off guard duty in the early hours of June 30, 2009, when he approached his team leader with a peculiar question. If he were to leave their base — a remote U.S. outpost in the mountains of south-eastern Afghanistan — would it be a problem if he took his ‘sensitive’ equipment? Having been advised that taking his gun and night vision goggles would certainly be ‘a problem’, the 23-year-old returned to his makeshift barracks and collected his water bottle, digital camera, knife, compass and diary. Then he slipped into the darkness. Life imitating art: Private First Class Bowe Bergdahl as a young private (left) and a Taliban hostage (right) When he was nowhere to be found at roll call the following morning, the military launched a major operation to find him before the enemy did. Reports came in of a U.S. soldier asking the locals if any of them spoke English, and children said they saw a soldier behaving strangely as he writhed around on his stomach in the weeds. By the afternoon, intercepted radio  messages revealed he was in the hands of the Taliban. Despite a couple of early sightings and a series of internet video appearances, which showed him looking progressively more gaunt and unhealthy, Bergdahl disappeared. An idealistic dreamer who once tried to join the French Foreign Legion and idolised British survival expert Bear Grylls, he wasn’t seen again face to face by a fellow countryman until last Saturday. Then, nearly five years after he went missing, the 28-year-old was handed over to special forces troops on the Afghan-Pakistan border and whisked off in a helicopter. The exchange of the sole U.S. prisoner of war in Afghanistan for five Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo Bay has plunged the Obama administration into a major row over ethics and strategy. It has also sensationally raised another question: just who is the man the U.S. is welcoming back? The return of a long-missing soldier held by captors as ruthless as the Taliban (or rather a linked group called the Haqqani) would normally be the occasion for universal rejoicing. But Republican politicians and former comrades — until now legally forbidden to discuss Bergdahl in case it jeopardised rescue efforts — say there is nothing to celebrate. Bergdahl, they claim, was a ‘selfish’ deserter who cost the lives of at least six other U.S. soldiers, who died as the hunt for him took them into dangerous rebel-held areas. 'Captured by Al Qaeda in Iraq': Fictional Sergeant Nicholas Brody is played by actor Damian Lewis in Homeland . Worse, amid considerable evidence that he was sickened by the American military operation, and sympathetic towards Afghans, some insist the U.S. may be welcoming back a traitor. Whatever his motives for leaving his base and walking out of the war, could Bergdahl have been ‘turned’ by the Taliban? As former comrades jammed internet forums and radio stations yesterday to attack Bergdahl, it was becoming increasingly clear why some liken him to the  fictional Sergeant Nicholas Brody in the smash-hit TV series Homeland. Brody, played by British actor Damian . Lewis, is a U.S. Marine captured by Al Qaeda in Iraq and gradually . converted to the terrorists’ cause. He learns Arabic and becomes a . Muslim. In a moment that convinces him he is on the wrong side, a little . boy he has befriended is slaughtered in a U.S. air attack. While no one seriously suggests Bergdahl is an Islamic assassin, there are striking echoes of the TV drama in his story . Rescued by special forces years later, he is welcomed home by an America that  little suspects he has a terrorist agenda and plans to assassinate the Vice-President. While no one seriously suggests Bergdahl is an Islamic assassin, there are striking echoes of the TV drama in his story. In Homeland, the hostage’s wife finds solace in the arms of his best friend — and Bergdahl will return to find his girlfriend, Monica Lee, has found love with another man. Bergdahl told her in internet messages to his family not to wait for him. But when her mother called her with the news of his release, the 25-year-old asked her: ‘What do I do now?’ Of course, just because a TV series indulges an outlandish scenario, it hardly means a real soldier would ever react the same way. Bergdahl’s father, Bob, has said he will ‘defend his character until the day I die’. Mr Bergdahl, who lives with Bowe’s mother, Jani, at a ranch near the Idaho mountain town of Hailey, learned Pashto — Afghanistan’s official language — and grew a bushy, Taliban-style beard. He wanted to come across as the sort of man to whom the Taliban might respond when he pleaded for his son’s return. Parents: Bergdahl's father, Bob (right), has said he will 'defend his character'. Mr Bergdahl, who lives with Bowe's mother, Jani (left), at a ranch in Idaho, learned the language of Pashto and grew a Taliban-style beard . Even Bergdahl’s devoted parents admit he made for a highly unconventional soldier. They home-schooled the boy, instilling in him their Christian values. He was outdoorsy, able to shoot a .22 rifle and ride a horse by the age of five. Later, he travelled around Europe and applied to join the French  Foreign Legion but was turned down, reportedly because recruiters doubted his mental stability.  Instead, he joined the U.S. Army, but from the start he kept apart from other soldiers, whom he saw as ill-disciplined and hopeless. He buried himself in books about Zen meditation, the writings of Aristotle and a book called Three Cups Of Tea, about a crusade to educate girls in Afghanistan. He told a friend that if their first tour of duty in Afghanistan was ‘lame’, he was going to ‘walk off into the mountains of Pakistan’. He told a friend that if their first tour of duty in Afghanistan was 'lame', he was going to 'walk off into the mountains of Pakistan' Members of his unit, part of the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, say his manner became odder when they reached eastern Afghanistan’s remote Paktika region. ‘He spent more time with the Afghans than he did with his platoon,’ said a comrade. He told some of them he wanted to walk to India. His father admitted to military investigators that his son became ‘psychologically isolated’. In letters and emails home,  Bergdahl made his disillusionment clear. ‘I feel ashamed to even be American,’ he wrote. ‘The horror of the self-righteous arrogance that they thrive in. It is all revolting.’ In an uncanny echo of Homeland, Bergdahl was particularly affected by seeing an Afghan child fatally run over by a U.S. armoured vehicle. ‘We don’t even care when we hear each other talk about running their children down in the dirt streets with our armoured trucks,’ he complained in a final email sent three days before he disappeared. ‘I am sorry for everything. The horror that is America is disgusting.’ The possibility that Bergdahl might have become more than just an unwilling prisoner started to gain traction after the Taliban put out an early internet video of him wearing a long beard and military uniform, denouncing the U.S. operation and pleading to be released. Nevertheless, the U.S. Army promoted Bergdahl twice while he was a captive, first to the rank of specialist, before making him up to a sergeant. He is also entitled to his full back pay. Clip: A still from a 2010 video released by the Taliban had footage of a man said to be Bowe Bergdahl (left) In 2010, a Taliban commander calling himself Haji Nadeem claimed Bergdahl had converted to Islam and renamed himself Abdullah. Bergdahl, he said, had learned Pashto and was so trusted that he was allowed to go off bird-hunting with an old British rifle and sleep at night without shackles. More significantly, he had allegedly been teaching the Taliban how make bombs and set ambushes. Afghan intelligence officials confirmed they had heard he was socialising with his captors over Afghan green tea and even teaching them to play baseball. The Pentagon dismissed stories of his providing military assistance as Taliban propaganda. Others pointed out that Bergdahl can be forgiven for fraternising with men he feared might behead him. Even Nadeem admitted his fellow Taliban had come to doubt the sincerity of ‘our dear guest’ after his escape attempt in 2010. In an uncanny echo of Homeland, Bergdahl was particularly affected by seeing an Afghan child fatally run over by a U.S. armoured vehicle . Reportedly jumping from a first-floor window of his mud-and-brick home in Pakistan, he evaded recapture for three days before being found weak, exhausted and near naked in a shallow trench. Whatever the truth, he faces tough questions from debriefers, once they overcome his reported difficulties about speaking English. Former comrades certainly don’t feel he deserves a hero’s welcome. Some say he must be tried before a military court. ‘Bergdahl was a deserter and soldiers from his unit died trying to track him down,’ says Captain Nathan Bradley Bethea, who served in the same battalion. But he said he refused to call Bergdahl a ‘traitor’ on the grounds he didn’t know what happened after he was captured. The White House insists it doesn’t care why he left his post, it simply wants him home. But the Obama administration faces angry accusations that it broke the law by not warning Congress of the hostage deal, and has set an ugly precedent that will encourage other terror groups to take hostages. In his hometown of Hailey in the picturesque Sawtooth Mountains, few believe the stories about Bergdahl being a deserter or a traitor. His only weakness, locals say, was being too much of an idealist. So could he really, like Homeland’s Sgt Brody, have been ‘turned’ by his captors, or is Bergdahl simply a man who has suffered an awful ordeal? For the officers debriefing him in Germany, they are tantalising  questions indeed.","Private First Class Bowe Bergdahl went missing in Afghanistan in 2009 .

"Phillip Hughes, the NSW batsman who has died from a brain injury two days after being struck in the head by a bouncer, was a spirited young cricketer who some said 'had the world at his feet'.

Hughes made a total of 15,789 runs in his first class career and many of those were ones or twos - as he laughingly recalled some years ago, he wasn't a big scorer of fours or sixes. The left-handed opener was the son of Greg Hughes, who cleared a patch on his farm for young Phil to practice cricket, and  mother Virginia, who is of Italian origin. Growing up with sister, Megan, and brother, Jason, as a teenager he often helped out hauling heavy bunches of bananas for the family business. As a schoolboy, he was also a talented rugby league player who played alongside another Macksville boy, the future Rabbitohs star Greg Inglis. Seven years ago almost to the day, just before his 19th birthday, Hughes made his debut in first class cricket scoring a spot in the NSW side. As a 20-year-old, he won the the Bradman Young Player of the Year, accepting the award in Melbourne during the Allan Border Medal presentations in February 2009.

The fall: Phil Hughes was 63 not out when he was bowled a bouncer at the SCG on Tuesday and struck in the head, falling to the ground with a brain injury from which he died on Thursday. His death has shocked Australia and the cricket world . Grief: Cricket players embrace at St Vincents Hospital after visiting their mate, Phillip Hughes, as he lay gravely injured in the Intensive Care Unit following his tragic head injury while playing the game he loved . Since Hughes' stunning 2009 Test debut at the age of 20 in South Africa, he had been dropped five times, which might have defeated a less determined player. But despite controversies over his style, technique and his off-field activities with the friends he keeps, Hughes  always plugged on, taking on the verbal bouncers along with those on the field. He was friends with  Anthony Mundine, the controversial boxer's colourful manager, Khoder Nasser and rugby league player Sonny Bill Williams, who all have attended his matches to support the young opener. In return the cricketer  sat ringside at Mundine's fights. Phillip Hughes (pictured) walks out of the SCG dressing room on Tuesday to open the batting for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield innings which ended when he was fatally struck in the head . Prone to periodic run droughts due to a perceived inability to deal with the short ball, Hughes  test average was 32.65. In 2009, after being presented with the Australian Baggy Green cap No. 408, he stepped up to the crease for his first Test match, in  South Africa. In that Test series, Hughes became the youngest Australian player in cricketing history to score back-to-back centuries in his debut, which he achieved in the Durban Test. Hughes was selected to play the 2009 Ashes Test series in England, but was dropped when the English bowlers pitched short balls to him in an effort to exploit his weaknesses. But what he may have lacked occasionally in technique, he made up for with heart and drive. In the 2010/2011 Ashes series, selectors  ignored him except as an injury replacement for Simon Katich in the final test; he toured Sri Lanka in late 2011 and scored 126 in the third test. But in the New Zealand tour that summer, poor performance saw him dropped and he signed a contract to play county cricket for Worcestershire in England and work on his technique. In January 2011, Hughes was stunned to be accused of 'cheating' by English cricket legend Sir Ian Botham after being bowled a bouncer in the Sydney Test by Alastair Cook and staying on the field after what was initially thought to be a catch. That year, Hughes decided to make the wrenching decision to transfer away from his friends and his family in NSW to South Australia for the good of his game - and it paid off. Sonny Bill Williams, Anthony Mundine and Khoder Nasser (left to right, pictured) were good friends and supporters of Test cricketer, Phillip Hughes, who has died two days after he was struck in the head by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG . In 2012, he was the Sheffield Shield's highest run scorer and was selected for the 2012/2013 Sri Lankan tour of Australia. He was rumoured to be up for a $1 million Cricket Australia contract and  in January last year he became the first Australian batsman to score a debut century  in One Day International cricket. Last October, Hughes made his Twenty20 international cricket debut for Australia in the United Arab Emirates. Before his injury at the SCG on Tuesday, he was up for selection in next week's Test against India at the Gabba in Brisbane. He had played 26 Test matches and Australian selector and cricketing legend Rod Marsh described Hughes as 'a hell of a good batsman'. As cricketers, legends of the game and mates said after the news came on Thursday afternoon of Phil Hughes' death: 'his time was just around the corner ... he was about to come into his own'.","Cricketer Phillip Hughes has died in hospital two days after being struck in a cricket match .

"Jacqui Porter (pictured) was today cleared of concealing her husband's multi-million pound scam . The ex-wife of a multimillion-pound fraudster who used his ill-gotten gains to sponsor rugby stars such as Kenny Logan has been cleared of concealing his scam. Gerald Porter, 51, cheated his firm Greenfield Property Management Limited out of £3.2 million to lead a luxury lifestyle that included driving expensive cars, taking luxury holidays and throwing lavish parties. The huge rugby fan also spent some of the cash on the Wasps side and their winger Kenny Logan, the husband of TV sports presenter Gabby Logan. The Scotsman used company credit cards to splash out on VIP games, sponsor players and buy them flash cars and dinners at Michelin starred restaurants, London's Southwark Crown Court heard. His former wife Jacqui, 40, of Ruislip, west London, was accused of concealing or converting proceeds of crime. But a jury cleared her after more than five hours of deliberation. Speaking after her acquittal, she said: 'After one and a half years of hell it is a huge relief.' She and  Porter - who was jailed for five years in March for conspiracy to defraud - went on a mammoth spending spree well beyond his legitimate £60,000 salary. The family blew £132,000 on exotic holidays in two years and a bouncy castle was permanently erected in the ‘park-like gardens’ of their rented mansion. Jurors heard how rugby-mad Gerald cheated on his long suffering wife and partied at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Mrs Porter splurged thousands on designer spending sprees across the world blowing thousands of pounds on shoes, handbags and clothes in Versace, Emporio Armani and other designer labels in Dubai. But she claimed the Barclaycard, which was funded by the company, was only used for ‘emergencies’. She told jurors she was ‘totally unaware’ of her Scottish husband’s fraudulent activities. Former Scottish international Kenny Logan told the trial how he had been duped into thinking the fraudster was a genuine sponsor. Mr Logan, 42, said he believed Porter was a property developer who was 'happily spending money and I knew no reason to believe he was dodgy'. Mr Logan said Porter was well known in the world of rugby and 'he had the fast cars and consistently spent money for years'. Well known for his penchant for helicopter trips, Porter was 'very well known at Wasps and was the go-to man when it came to sponsorship', Mr Logan said. Jurors heard that Porter donated £100,000 of Greenfield cash to Championship side London Scottish while the west London-based club were struggling financially and in the fourth tier of the English rugby league. Kenny Logan, pictured during an appearance at Southwark Crown Court. He testified that Logan had been consistently spending money 'for years' and was duped into thinking he was a genuine sponsor . Mr Logan (centre in 2000) told the trial he had come to know Mr Porter around the time he played for Wasps . Mr Logan added: 'He always drove expensive vehicles and was often seen around at functions in his Bentley which changed to a Land Rover Sport. 'He would also think nothing of hiring helicopters to fly people to events.' The fraudster also arranged for officials at London Wasps to get a Mercedes. It only emerged after a coach left and tried to return the luxury car that no one knew about the arrangement. Porter also sponsored an end-of-season dinner which Mr Logan believed would have cost about £15,000 and paid £5,816 for a table at a dinner which he never used. Mr Logan added: 'I was also in his company at restaurants where he would purchase the top wines. It was the top restaurants such as Claridge's in London.' Mr Logan, who is married to TV presenter Gabby Logan (left), said he was ashamed to have introduced Mr Porter to his mother-in-law Christine Yorath (pictured, right, with her husband, former footballer Terry Yorath) But in early 2010 Porter told Mr Logan he was 'in trouble' and had stolen money. Mr Logan told him to leave his home and he has not seen him since. He told jurors: 'I feel entirely let down by Mr Porter. I acted in good faith in everything that I did with him.' Mr Logan recalled later hearing people call him Dr Porter, but said 'I suspect that this was part of his life of fantasy which we were all entangled in'. Mrs Porter met her future husband while working as an industrial chemicals saleswoman when he offered her a lift in his forklift truck across a muddy Uxbridge building site in 1994. Evidence: Mrs Porter said her husband was away for long periods on trips where he would cheat on her, go to sporting events and even the Playboy Mansion, picture, on one occasion, the court heard . He initially moved into her three-bed council home but by 2005 the family with two new children moved to a five-bed rented mansion costing more than £32,000 a year. The ex-policeman had a number of affairs throughout their relationship but Jacqui stuck by her husband, saying she felt responsible for becoming ‘fat and unattractive’ after the birth of her fourth child. ‘A package came through my door with a bundle of emails in it - they were very explicit,’ she sobbed. ‘They basically said Gerry had been having an affair with a lady he worked with and that I was stupid that I didn’t realise what had been going on, that basically he was a cad and philanderer and that I should leave him.’ Gerald also took a ‘high ranking police officer’ as a lover and temporarily left the family home, she told jurors. Jacqui Porter (pictured) and her husband jetted across the globe on luxury holidays using the stolen funds . The family jetted across the globe, taking luxury holidays to Bermuda, Mexico, Dubai and New Zealand which would have required an ‘astronomic’ salary to support them. They boasted a fleet of cars, including a Bentley used as a ‘company car’, a Range Rover, a BMW and a VW Beetle. The couple spent £130,000 a year - their total legitimate household income - on private school fees for their four children to attend prestigious St. Benedict’s in Ealing. And they hosted lavish parties at the family’s rented mansion in Harefield, Hillingdon, where a bouncy castle stood in the ‘park-like’ gardens. A further £62,000 was spent wining and dining at Royal Ascot and helicopters were chartered to ferry the family around. One helicopter trip from Glasgow airport to Culzean Castle in Ayrshire where the family rented a £1800 per month flat cost £2742. Jacqui’s niece Alice Moss visited Scotland twice with the Porters, on one occasion staying at the Turnberry Hotel, a five-star golf resort and spa. ‘Gerald flew in to the Turnberry by helicopter and landed in the grounds - people thought that somebody famous was coming,’ she said.","Jacqui Porter, 40, cleared on charge of covering up her husband's scams .

"The aunt of a missing 15-year-old schoolgirl who is thought to have been radicalised online before travelling to Syria says powerful jihadists are 'brainwashing' British teenagers through the internet. Sucdi Ali said her family are 'heartbroken' over suggestions schoolgirl Yusra Hussien may have become a 'jihadi bride' after she secretly left her Bristol home more than two weeks ago. She believes the teenager, who visited her in London over the summer, was radicalised online after spending increasing amounts of time on her laptop and smart phone and begged her to come home. Scroll down for video . Yusra Hussien, 15, may have become a 'jihadi bride' after she secretly left her Bristol home and fled to Syria more than two weeks ago . 'If she is in Syria, for her to become a thing, they say, Jihadi bride - if that is the thing Yusra did then internet grooming is definitely the case because where would this come from,' Ms Ali said. 'We don't want her to go to Syria and marry some unknown man, God knows who he is or what kind of guy he is or what kind of crime he's done or God knows what's in his head. It didn't come from us, where did it come from? 'We have to be all scared. If these powerful people are out there and they can brainwash these children or 15 or 19-year-olds to leave their own home then they are very powerful people. 'There will be more girls and boys leaving Britain or any other European country.' Her aunt Sucdi Ali (left) said she believed the teenager was radicalised online after, pictured with mother Safiya Hussien, and Ikram Mohamed . Family believe she was groomed by powerful jihadists online after spending increasing amounts of time on her laptop and smart phone . On the day of her disappearance she told her family she was leaving early for a school trip but was not seen again. 'If it can happen to Yusra it can happen to anyone,' Ms Ali said. 'She was just a normal, young girl. She was a home girl. 'There was no anger, no frustration, no 'why is Syria going through this, why is this happening in Gaza?' We had no idea.' Friends of Yusra claim to have spoken with her over the last few days via Facebook messages in which she said is 'safe and happy in her new life' but refused to say where she was. Yusra, who is of Somali descent, is thought to have met up with 17-year-old girl Abdirashiid Dirie from London and headed to Turkey, where police believe they attempted to cross the border into the neighbouring war-torn state. British authorities have expressed increasing concerns about hundreds of UK-born would-be jihadis who have gone to join Islamist forces in the Middle Eastern state. Ms Ali added: 'We want her to know she hasn't done anything wrong. Wherever she is we love her still. 'She's not in any trouble. She won't be arrested. We just want her to come back to the UK.' Her mother begged for her safe return after it was claimed that Yusra could have made contact with a dating site called Jihad Matchmaker. The Daily Mirror was told counter-terrorism officers believe she may have made contact with a Twitter account in the same name, which urges followers to 'picture all the little Mujahideen running around', a number of weeks ago.","Yusra Hussien, 15, may have become a 'jihadi bride' after travelling to Syria .

"Reports are coming in that Scotland’s beloved Loch Ness monster may be dead. For the first time in almost 90 years no ‘confirmed sightings’ have been made of the Serpentine Scottish beast. Veteran Nessie spotter Gary Campbell, who keeps a register of sightings, said no one had come forward in 18 months to say they had seen the monster. For the first time in almost 90 years no 'confirmed sightings' have been made of the Serpentine Scottish beast . Bookmaker William Hill also said the three entries to its annual Nessie spotting contest could be explained. They were images of a wave, a duck and a picture not even taken on Loch Ness. Mr Campbell said it was the first time since 1925 that there had been no confirmed reports of the monster. ‘It's very upsetting news and we don't know where she's gone,’ he said. Marmaduke Wetherell, seated, is pictured studying a chart of the Loch Ness in a search for the Loch Ness Monster. He was said to have faked the most famous picture in revenge for bad publicity . There are some suggestions that Nessie isn’t dead at all, but on holiday in Australia. A photograph that emerged in November appears to show the Loch Ness Monster has headed Down Under for a place in the sun. Taken off Magnetic Island - located off the Queensland coastal city of Townsville - the pictures have convinced locals they have their very own Loch Ness Monster. With a population of just over 2,800, the island is buzzing after the bizarre monster-like 'creature' suddenly popped up out of the pristine waters off an area known as Picnic Bay. The image, which is eerily reminiscent of the famous 1934 image of the Loch Ness Monster, had visitors and locals scratching their heads, with theories ranging from it being a large bird to a sunken boat. Magnetic Island resident David 'Crusty' Herron said he was 'stoked' to capture the images on camera. 'We've started to call the big fella Lost Nessie. When I looked out and saw it, I thought s***, it's like that Loch Ness over there in Scotland. ‘The number of sightings has been reducing since the turn of the century but this is the first time in almost 90 years that Nessie wasn't seen at all. ‘Pretty much everyone now carries a camera with them in their smart phone - this allows then to snap what they're seeing and means that we don't just have to rely on eyewitness evidence. ‘As last year has shown, all the pictures and videos taken can prove to the expert eye that it wasn't Nessie that was being filmed.’ William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said: ‘Although we had three entries, one was a wave, one a duck and the other wasn't from Loch Ness - even the one other sighting for the year that wasn't entered was a video of a wave. Experts at the loch are appealing for anyone with new evidence from 2013 come forward. ‘It could be good for them,’ said Mr Adams, ‘we've now more than doubled the odds of finding proof that Nessie exists to 250-1 and we've done a “monster rollover” on the prize meaning that this year's winner could be taking away £2000.’ Mr Campbell, a chartered accountant based in Inverness, has been logging Nessie sightings for 17 years after seeing something in the loch himself. As Nessie's registrar of sightings, he has put together a list of sightings going back 1,500 years. Irish missionary St Columba is said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD. The original so-called Surgeon's Photograph, taken by Dr Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934, supposedly showed the monster's head and neck, but was also later proved to be a hoax . Mr Campbell said: ‘So far 1,036 reported sightings have been recorded and there were some in 2012. ‘I'm convinced that Nessie has just taken some time out and will be back with a vengeance this year.’ Last year, Loch Ness Monster was placed ahead of the Himalaya's Yeti in a list of ‘top 18 mysteries’ for travellers to solve in 2014. Wanderlust Magazine put Nessie at number three and the Yeti at 12. Easter Island's carved monoliths, the moai, were in first place followed by Mongolia's Gobi rock art. Also listed are the Pyramids of Giza, the USA's Marfa ghost lights, Angkor Wat in Cambodia and finding Australia's Tasmanian tiger. Actor Charlie Sheen recently spoke about his surprise search for the Loch Ness Monster - revealing that he hunted Nessie with a bottle of whisky. Sheen dragged cohort Brian Peck (right) to Scotland so they could hunt for the Loch Ness Monster . Actor Charlie Sheen recently spoke about his surprise search for the Loch Ness Monster - revealing that he hunted Nessie with a bottle of whisky. And the 48-year-old admitted he wants to return with American TV host Jay Leno to resume his monster hunt. The Anger Management star flew to Scotland last summer to look for Nessie. And now he told Leno last month of what really happened during his search - admitting there was an unexplained ‘crazy’ event on the day he left. ‘Something happened, there was an event at the top of the water that was crazy,’ he said, without specifying exactly what,’ he said. The Loch Ness Monster has been a subject of mass intrigue and debate since it came to the world's attention in 1933. There are some suggestions that Nessie isn¿t dead at all, but on holiday in Australia. This picture taken off the coast of Australia looks uncannily like the famous 1934 image of the Loch Ness Monster which has got locals buzzing with speculation .

"A young woman branded vain for wanting a lump on her throat removed says being stubborn saved her life - after the growth turned out to be cancerous. Tove Radelius was later told she had been suffering with the disease in her thyroid - a gland in the neck - for at least a decade. But her requests for diagnosis and treatment had repeatedly fallen on deaf ears, with medics blaming hormones and even hypochondria. VIDEO Scroll down to see Macmillan's world's biggest coffee morning . Tove Radelius was constantly branded vain for wanting a lump on her throat removed. When she finally succeeded in getting surgery, doctors discovered it was cancerous . Miss Radelius was later told she had been suffering with the disease in her thyroid - a gland in the neck - for at least a decade . She told MailOnline: 'Doctors laughed in my face, called me vain and said it could be removed - but it would be classed as plastic surgery. 'But you know your own body and when something isn't right and I refused to give up. 'It is purely my own stubbornness that saved my life.' Miss Radelius, originally from Sweden but now living in London, first noticed the growth when she was 18. 'I woke up one morning and noticed a huge lump on my throat. I got worried and started investigating what it was. 'While it wasn't painful, it was more than 3cm in size. It later began pressing on my vocal cords and I began to sound quite hoarse.' But despite making multiple medical appointments, her concerns were dismissed by different doctors in Sweden. 'As I was young, otherwise healthy - and did not have a troubled medical past or any illnesses in my family - they simply would not take me seriously,' she recalled. 'One doctor even told me it was very common for young, hormonal women to have lumps on their throat, and that I should come back in two years time if it hadn't disappeared ""naturally"". Miss Radelius (pictured after surgery) first noticed the growth when she was 18. 'While it wasn't painful, it was more than 3cm in size. It later began pressing on my vocal cords and I began to sound quite hoarse' 'But I insisted it was wrong for a young a woman to have a large, unexplainable lump on her throat, and that my intuition told me something wasn't right. 'I felt like I had something foreign in my body. I didn't care what it was, I just wanted it gone. 'One doctor it told me it could be done, but it would be ""purely out of vanity"",' she said. Determined not to be fobbed off, she convinced doctors to perform a biopsy - but even then this was performed incorrectly and the results came back negative. 'All along, from most doctors I saw (which were a lot of different ones) I was treated as a young naive hypochondriac who didn't know her own body as I was too inexperienced with life,' she said. Eventually, Miss Radelius, now 26, found another doctor who agreed to remove the growth. 'But he added it would be classified as cosmetic surgery. 'All along it was treated as completely harmless and benign.' After the lump was removed, tests revealed Miss Radelius was suffering from papillary thyroid cancer - the most common form of the disease which tends to strike women and younger people . It was only when the lump was sent off for testing -  a standard protocol for any growth removed - that the devastating truth emerged. The so-called benign lump was actually thyroid cancer - and Miss Radelius had most likely had the disease for a decade. She said: I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was a very traumatic situation, not helped by the doctor being very matter of fact. Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common type of thyroid cancer. About 6 out of 10 thyroid cancers diagnosed  are papillary. This type is more common in women and in younger people. It is usually slow growing. But it can sometimes spread to lymph nodes in the neck or near by. Most people with papillary thyroid cancer have no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. You may notice a lump in your neck. Some people may have a hoarse voice or difficulty in swallowing. This can be due to pressure from the cancer in the throat. Very occasionally, the cancer can cause a noisy type of breathing called stridor. Some people feel very tired and as though they have no energy or strength. Source: Cancer Research UK . 'No one apologised for not having taken me seriously.' Tests revealed Miss Radelius was suffering from papillary thyroid cancer - the most common form of the disease which tends to strike women and younger people. Usually slow growing, it can spread to lymph nodes in the neck or near by. While the disease often has no symptoms in the early stages, a lump, tiredness and a hoarse voice are common signs. Looking back, Miss Radelius says she had suffered with many of these, but due to having the disease for so long, they had become 'normal'. 'I had gone from the age of eight to 18 feeling tired and depressed, so I just thought it was normal to feel like this. 'It is only now, in retrospect, that I can see that I had depression for several years before I found the lump, and this is a common effect of thyroid illnesses.' Surgeons confirmed she would need a second round of surgery to totally remove her thyroid - followed by radioactive iodine treatment. Given the size of the tumour, and the growth speed of the cancer type, the surgeon estimated it began growing when she was eight years old. She is now dependent on medication for the rest of her life to get thyroxine, the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. She said having cancer as a young person was 'horrible for so many reasons'. 'You have to having to deal with a a serious illness at a time of your life when things are already hard,' she said. 'You are disbelieved by the only people who can help you and should take things seriously' Eighteen months after discovering the lump, she got the all-clear and decided to take control of her life. 'I felt that life was too short, so I packed my bags and moved to London where I had always dreamed of living. 'I built up a new life from scratch, began studying and moved on to work for one of the largest accounting firms, where I am currently working and studying for my professional qualifications. 'Looking back at my experience, my first advice for young people dealing with cancer, or believing that you may be affected, is to stand your ground. 'If you feel that something is wrong, dare to say so and demand the treatment you are entitled to. 'You know your body better than anyone else and even if somebody is telling you that certain symptoms are ""normal"", you know your body best. 'I know this is easier said than done, but if I hadn't done so I might have either been scared off by the ""cosmetic surgery"" comment from the incompetent doctor, or I had waited a few years before looking into it again - and it may have been too late.' Miss Radelius is supporting Macmillan’s World’s Biggest Coffee Morning this Friday . Miss Radelius said having cancer as a young person was 'horrible for so many reasons'. She told MailOnline: 'You have to having to deal with a a serious illness at a time of your life when things are already hard. You are disbelieved by the only people who can help you and should take things seriously. 'For thyroid cancer patients, there can be a depression caused by the unidentified thyroid problems. 'On top of this, once being diagnosed, there is the feeling you have to be an adult and be strong, not showing any signs of weakness, I have never felt so lonely and unsupported as when I had cancer. 'It was suggested I take antidepressants to deal with it, which I don't feel was the right solution. 'You do not - and should not - have to deal with it yourself. 'I felt that if I didn't put on a brave face, no one else would cope, so instead I broke down in tears on my own and tried to handle it all myself. This is not right, and the consequence of this is that my process of dealing with the emotional effects of the illness were delayed. 'There are people out there who you can speak to, who can help you through this traumatising illness. 'As lonely as you may feel, you are not alone, there are people out there like Macmillan Cancer Support, and people like myself, who know what you are going through and want to listen and help. I wish I had known about support groups such as Macmillan.' Miss Radelius is supporting Macmillan's World’s Biggest Coffee Morning which takes place on Friday 26th September.

"South African prison bosses have hit back at 'inaccurate, serious allegations' in the Oscar Pistorius trial that the country's jails are violent and disease-ridden. Despite saying they didn't want to interfere in the decision about whether Pistorius is sent to jail, the Department of Correctional Services today issued a statement defending their facilities. It said: 'The image of our correctional centres, our department and our government in general is at stake. We therefore deem it appropriate that we register our concern.' Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius is comforted by his brother Carl Pistorius as his defense lawyer, Barry Roux looks on; the court has been told that Pistorius could be vulnerable to physical and sexual violence in imprisoned . The court was also told that South African prisons were poorly-equipped for disabled people and Pistorius could catch a variety of diseases including Aids and tuberculosis . The court was told that prison would 'break' Pistorius and rob him of a future . As the judge heard mitigating factors in the athlete's sentencing, Annette Vergeer, a probation officer called by Mr Pistorius's defence team, described the dangers of drugs, gangs and sodomy in the country's prisons. She also said they were poorly-equipped for disabled people and warned of the risks of transmission of Aids, tuberculosis and other diseases, The Telegraph reported. The court was told prison would 'break' Pistorius and rob him of a future. She also suggested there was a chance he could be raped. Her claims were backed-up by Amnesty International and Justice Project reports which last year exposed alleged torture and other abuse at a state prison in Bloemfontein.

"In the future, your phone will know your everyday activities so well, it will automatically realise when it has been stolen. That’s the thinking behind the latest software developed by Glasgow researchers. By combining data from various sensors in the phone, the app  knows when it is being used by an unfamiliar person, or taken to an unknown location. It then asks for an authentication code before being unlocked. The software was created by Glasgow Caledonian University and uses phone sensors to build a profile of the user’s behaviour. For example, it tracks which apps they use on daily basis, uses Wi-Fi sensors to learn which networks are typically within that user’s vicinity, as well as how they typically hold a device . ‘Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are rapidly becoming our digital identity,’ explained Professor Just and his colleagues from Glasgow Caledonian University in their ‘Data Driven Authentication: On the Effectiveness of User Behaviour Modelling with Mobile Device Sensors’ paper. ‘They are used for payments and authentication, and they store valuable information. The software uses sensors in phones to build a profile of the user. For example, it tracks which apps they use on daily basis. It also uses Wi-Fi sensors to learn which networks are typically within that user’s vicinity on a daily or weekly basis, as well as which mobile towers they travel near. The accelerometer can even determine how a user typically holds a device. In addition, the phone uses sensors to learn about a user's environments, such as how light their home is, or how noisy their office is. The data from all these available sensors are combined to create a 'comfort score.' If the location is unknown, or sensor data has never been encountered, the score is zero. If comfort levels drop below 0.2, suggesting  the behaviours are out of the ordinary, the device will ask for an authentication code to unlock. ‘Their relatively low cost, ease of use and ‘always on’ connectivity provides a suitable platform for many day-to-day tasks involving money and sensitive data, which in turn makes mobile devices an attractive attack target.’ The software uses the sensors built into phones to build a profile of the user. For example, it tracks which apps they use on a daily basis, and if there are any patterns in terms of which order they are opened in, or how long they use them. It also uses Wi-Fi sensors to learn which networks are typically within that user’s vicinity on a daily or weekly basis, as well as which mobile towers they travel near. The accelerometer can even determine how a user typically holds a device. In addition, the phone uses sensors to learn about the user's environments, such as how light their home is, or how noisy their office is. The data from all these available sensors were combined to create a so-called comfort score based on its frequency for the given time and location. If the location is unknown, or the sensor data has never been encountered for that location, the comfort score is zero. And because some sensors provide more than one input, such as noise and light, the readings were used more than once. The data from all these available sensors were combined to create a so-called comfort score based on its frequency for the given time and location. Pictured are three individual usage patterns for researchers involved in the study . If comfort levels drop below 0.2, suggesting the behaviours are out of the ordinary, the device asks for an authentication code to unlock . After the software has learnt the user’s behaviours, it initiates ‘deployment mode’, and the device automatically sets a detection threshold to be 0.2. This means that if comfort levels drops below 0.2, suggesting the behaviours are out of the ordinary, the device will ask for an authentication code to unlock. This can be different to the user’s PIN, and unique to that user and device. The software is adaptive enough to recognise that small deviations from normal behaviour is expected, but larger changes will trigger a response. During four separate tests, the comfort level dropped substantially below the owner’s average and there was a detection rate of 95 per cent. The only exception was when a friend or family-member, known as an ‘informed insider’ used the device. Professor Just explained that it takes a week, on average, for the software to learn its user’s activity. The software will undergo further tests before it can be released more widely to consumers.","The software was created by experts at Glasgow Caledonian University .

"A cellist and a beatboxer may seem like an unlikely musical duo but as this video shows,  it's clearly a combination that works. Maximillian, a crew member who usually beatboxes on flights was joined by cellist Francisco Vila and together the pair created sweet music. The improvised duet took place on a Southwest Airlines flight to Denver and was shot earlier this month. Cellist Francisco Vila decided to treat Southwest Airlines passengers to an impromptu . According to Newsflare, the Indianapolis University Chamber Orchestra was on the flight. The air steward did a beat-boxing performance, as he usually does on board the flight, when Mr Vila, the cellist, said he wanted to play a song as well. After two tracks the flight attendant joined the impromptu classical act as the other passengers listened in delight. The Ecuadorian-Spanish cellist Mr Vila, is said to be one of today's emerging classical music talents and is a soloist in residence at  the prestigious Queen Elisabeth. In the video the classical musician directs the air steward to give him  some room to 'bow' before they start on their tune.

"Germany is mourning the loss of 'mad millionaire' Klaus Zapf - an eccentric tycoon who worshipped socialism even as capitalism made him filthy rich. Mr Zapf, who passed away this week at the age of 62 on his third honeymoon, made his fortune in the removals business. His distinctive yellow and blue vans were a constant feature in city streets as they packed up and unloaded wares from across the country and the world. But he shunned the trappings of wealth. He gave most of his cash away, lived in a £400-a-month rented flat, despised ostentatiousness and shopped at discount supermarket Aldi. Scroll down for video . 'Mad millionaire' Klaus Zapf has died aged 62 from a heart attack on his third honeymoon. He lived a humble lifestyle despite being a multi-millionaire entrepeneur who made his fortune through his removals business . A sculpture of Vladimir Lenin stands outside one of Mr Zapf's businesses, which is based in Berlin . He planted a statue of his hero Vladimir Lenin next to his Zapf Umzüge company yard in the gritty Kreuzberg section of the city that over four decades became one of the largest removal firms in Europe. He called his business 'West Berlin's best removals collective,' although in reality he was a dictator - albeit a benevolent one. 'Here the delusions of grandeur are healed every day,' he said of his workplace. He loved Berlin but he was no native. Klaus Emil Heinrich Zapf moved to the divided, Cold War city from the Baden town of Eppingen at the start of the 1970s because he did not want to be called up to the army. West Berlin was unique in Germany at the time in that it allowed young men resident within its boundaries to skip military service. Consequently it was a magnet for thousands like him. He half-heartedly set about studying law, but admitted that he was more fond of studying pubs and their contents. To finance his legal ambitions he bought a clapped out old Transit van and began undercutting established removal firms. He couldn't drive but found people who could and instead set about the 'hard labour' of shifting the furniture during moves. Publicans in particular liked using him. He later claimed they were impressed by his three first names which they thought gave him a status he didn't have. Soon his 'alternative' removal service became the norm. He bought more vans, moved in squatters and doctors, lawyers and anyone who could afford to pay him - or at least promised to. Mr Zapf had an estimated fortune of £10million tied up in the company, but never took more than £300 a month . Mr Zapf's company is known across Europe for its yellow and blue vans. Bizarrely he never learned to drive . 'Zapf Removals - Owned by the Employees,' he boasted, with a logo on the side of his vans that read: 'Mens agitat molem - the spirit moves the mass.' He charged customers in posher parts of the city, like Dahlem and Zehlendorf, more than those in the working class districts like Wedding and Kreuzberg. He split the money between the workers and himself in true socialist style. When he died he had an estimated fortune of £10million tied up in the company which has 600 employees. He never drew a salary of more than £300 a month. Dressed like an American beatnik poet of the 1960s, with a long flowing beard and heavy rimmed black glasses to match, it was not unusual to see him on city streets at night picking up beer bottles out of litter bins so he could reclaim the deposit money. 'I don't need money. It just makes us unequal,' he said in an interview last year. 'There are just so many bloody idiots with money around, you don't need another one.' Married three times, the latest union in June this year, Mr Zapf was on his honeymoon when he died. He never bought a flat because he thought it would only contribute to a price-spiral and leave 'ordinary workers' unable to afford decent housing. But he had a sharp business brain and spotted opportunities to expand the business at every turn. Mr Zapf set up offices in Berlin, predicting when the Berlin Wall fell that the capital would move back to the city . When the Berlin Wall fell he was certain that the capital would move from sleepy Bonn on the Rhine to Berlin - and he was right. So he set up a logistics depot there that paid off handsomely when the politicians and civil servants began their great trek eastwards. He expanded into overseas removals and opened branch offices across Germany. He was described by the media as a 'genial despot' who once said at a shareholders meeting: 'The proletarian elite operates well with me!' Over the past decade he withdrew more and more from public view. Once a frequengter of SPD - Germany's Labour Party - functions, he preferred to sit instead in the Diener pub, meaning servant, in the Charlottenburg section of the city in the evenings and drink a few beers and talk with actors, painters, journalists and lawyers. On the question of whether he had a role model, he replied: 'Oh, yes, the main character from the August trilogy by Norwegian Nobel Laureate Knut Hamsun. To do this you need to know: August is a tireless navigator and braggart. And the only truly good human being who thinks unselfishly, not like all the others. He satirized the economic world, which was fine by me.' He died of a heart attack this week, his second in 14 years. In his last interview in February this year he said: 'My last move will be to the cemetery in Eppingen.' And that is where he will be laid to rest, the funeral attended by his sole daughter aged thirteen, friends, former wives and politicians.","Klaus Zapf made a £10million fortune running a removals company in Berlin .

"The date is August 2, 1914, and in a Munich square a crowd reacts enthusiastically as a soldier reads out a proclamation that Germany has declared war. Among them, cheering wildly and waving his hat, is the unmistakable figure of a 25-year-old Adolf Hitler. This was the moment, the day that imperial Germany plunged into the First World War, at which he finally he found his purpose in life, he was to claim later. Scroll down for video . Fake? Researchers claim Hitler's photographer Hoffmann manipulated this image of the moment Germany declared war on August 2, 1914, to feature the soon-to-be-dictator. It was later used for his election campaign . The photo first appeared in the pages . of the Nazi propaganda publication German Illustrated Observer on March . 12, 1932, the year Hitler ran for president, with the breathless . caption: ‘Adolf Hitler, the German patriot, is seen in the middle of the . crowd. He stands with blazing eyes – Adolf Hitler.’ But now, 100 years after it was taken, . there are claims the photo was faked and Hitler was never among the . crowd in the Odeonsplatz square. Research has failed to turn up the . original negative of the picture. And intense scrutiny of newsreel . footage has failed to spot Hitler among the throng. Trimmed: Hitler preferred a longer moustache in his younger years, only trimming it to fit under a gas mask when he became a soldier, historians claim . Even the length of his moustache would . also seem to indicate that the image of Hitler was inserted into the . picture. In 1914 he preferred a longer moustache, only trimming it when . he was a soldier so it would fit under a gas mask. Further evidence that perhaps the . whole thing was faked by him and Heinrich Hoffmann – later his personal . photographer whose assistant Eva Braun would go on to become Hitler’s . mistress – can be found in the pages of Hitler’s autobiography Mein . Kampf, published in 1925. He makes no mention of being in the . Odeonsplatz on August 2 but does make reference to the following day, . when he petitions the King of Bavaria to allow him, an Austrian, to . fight for Germany. Hoffmann was a master manipulator of . photographs who did his patron’s bidding. Experts say it would have been . easy for him to insert the photo of Hitler into the crowd scene. In a report about the research, German . newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said: ‘Some historians are expressing . suspicions that the photo was manipulated, although it is virtually . impossible to prove also that it is a forgery. ‘Hitler said his desire to be a . politician stemmed from that day in Munich. But the story is perhaps . just a little bit too perfect.’ Researcher Elizabeth Angermair, who . was asked to prove the provenance of the photo, said: ‘Its authenticity . is based solely on the testimony of Hitler. ‘In the city archive of Munich there . are several shots of the crowd in the Odeonsplatz, but the man with the . famous moustache is not in any of them.’","Image of Hitler in Odeonplatz, Munich, shows 'dictator celebrating WWI'

"Typewriter sales are booming in Germany as government departments, businesses and people go back-to-the-future to thwart spying by American spooks. Old tech is trumping the new in the wake of the NSA spying scandals which saw Chancellor Merkel's phone hacked on numerous occasions by Washington and culminated in the expulsion of the CIA spy chief from Berlin earlier this month. The head of the parliamentary inquiry into spying by the US National Security Service in Germany said his committee is considering using typewriters. But many have already made the switch. Sales of typewriters have jumped in Germany following allegations about American agents spying on MPs . Typewriter makers Olympia and Bandermann both report a revival in their fortunes. 'We sell about 10,000 typewriters every year,' Bandermann manager Rolf Bonnen told a German website, adding that sales last year were up a third on 2012. Last year Triumph Adler, part of Bandermann, made a YouTube video announcing its machines were 'Bug proof. NSA proof.' An . Olympia spokesman said the company expects to sell more typewriters . this year than at any time in the last 20 years, with sales set to . double in 2014 over last year's figures. Defence . contractor Diehl, several big businesses and many individuals are now . shunning their computers to put sensitive data on to paper. 'We will certainly cross the 10,000 threshold,' said Olympia manager Andreas Fostiropoulis. He said their Russian business partners had asked for 20 typewriters for the country’s secret services. President Barack Obama has today . dispatched two senior advisers to Germany in an apparent effort to . soothe tensions following new allegations of American spying. The prospect of German MPs reverting to typewriters comes a year after allegations surfaced that the mobile telephone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, pictured, had been bugged by American agents . The White House says chief of staff Denis McDonough and counter-terrorism adviser Lisa Monaco are in Berlin for meetings with their German counterparts. The White House says intelligence and security matters were in the agenda. The . meetings follow the discovery earlier this month of two alleged US spies . in Germany, prompting Chancellor Angela Merkel to demand the departure . of the CIA station chief in Berlin. The . allegations follow revelations that the US National Security Agency was . conducting mass surveillance of German citizens and eavesdropping on Ms . Merkel's cellphone. The White House says the US and Germany agreed to set up a dialogue to address intelligence concerns on both sides. The . jump in sales comes after Christian Democrat politician Patrick . Sensburg, head of the Bundestag’s parliamentary inquiry into the NSA . surveillance scandal, was asked on television last week whether . politicians were considering a return to older technology. Obama has today sent two senior advisers to Germany in an attempt to smooth relations after the expulsion of the CIA spy chief from Berlin earlier this month . Speaking . on the Morgenmagazin TV programme, he replied ‘As a matter of fact, we . have – and not electronic models either’ before adding ‘Yes, no joke,' The Guardian reports. Mr . Sensburg added: 'Of course we have to keep our internal communication . secure, send encrypted emails, use encrypted telephones and other . things, which I'm not going to say here.' The decision to order the CIA representative out came after dramatic reports of U.S. espionage in Germany. Public outrage at the revelations put pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to take action against the United States. Last week, Berlin said it had discovered a suspected U.S. spy in the Defence Ministry. That came just days after a German foreign intelligence worker was arrested on suspicion of being a CIA informant and admitted passing documents to a U.S. contact. The scandal has chilled relations between Berlin and Washington to levels not seen since Merkel's predecessor opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. It would not be the first time a country had turned to less sophisticated technology to counter spy activity. Russia's Federal Guard Service opted to use more typewriters after classified NSA documents were leaked by the organisation's former contractor Edward Snowden.","German typewriter companies showing jump in sales as people downgrade .

Englishman David Rochford, 30, from Battersea, London, decided to cheer on the Germany team for the game with his friends because of his love for the country. He said: 'We have been to Berlin quite a few times, and we like the Germans. We have some German friends and like the German people. We love Germany.' 'Also, we have a friend who looks like Jurgen Klopp [Borussia Dortmund's manager] so it was one more reason to support them.'

"Germany has ratcheted up its row with America over CIA spying in the country with the immediate expulsion of the agency’s Berlin chief. The dramatic rebuke to Washington comes after Germany’s intelligence agency, the BND, uncovered two cases of alleged American spying in a week. The U.S. official was told to leave the country in a public signal of Angela Merkel’s fury over US spying on Germany which in the past has included repeated snooping on her own mobile phone. A NATO ally expelling the spy chief of a friendly country is an extraordinary move but Mrs. Merkel has public opinion behind her. New polls show that many Germans want increased independence from America because of its snooping programme. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for 'greater trust' between the U.S. and her nation - code for demanding Americans stop spying on the NATO ally . 'The representative of the US intelligence services at the United States embassy has been asked to leave Germany,' a German government spokesman said. 'The request occurred against the backdrop of the ongoing investigation by federal prosecutors as well as the questions that were posed months ago about the activities of US intelligence agencies in Germany.' The move came a day after Berlin police searched the home and office of a German military intelligence official alleged to have been spying for America. The suspect is a foreign country specialist in the German defence ministry’s political department and has not yet been charged. German military intelligence alerted prosecutors after the suspect was found to have 'met suspiciously often with US contacts', according to Spiegel Magazine. A week ago a German intelligence agent was arrested after handing over German secrets to the US in exchange for cash.The 31-year-old employee of the BND stands accused of selling 218 top secret German intelligence documents he downloaded on to a USB stick for 25,000 pounds. Last year documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former NSA employee, revealed that the agency had been monitoring Mrs Merkel’s mobile phone.

"Detlef Guenzel, 56, goes on trial today accused of killing Wojciech Stempniewicz, 59, before cutting his body up and burying it in his garden . A German police officer who is accused of killing a man he met on a forum for cannibals before dismembering his body goes on trial today. Detlef Guenzel, 56, is accused of strangling Polish-born businessman Wojciech Stempniewicz, 59, in the basement of his bed and breakfast before cutting up his body and burying it in the garden. During the trial a video is due to be played which shows Gunzel in his underwear slicing the naked body of his victim into pieces while it hangs from a hook. Described as 'absolutely horrific' and 'beyond belief' by lawyers, the 50-minute tape features Gunzel dismembering the corpse while pop music plays. At one point he stops to listen for a heartbeat before continuing. Prosecutors claim that Guenzel strangled Stempniewicz before the grisly mutilation took place, while defence lawyers say the video proves the victim hanged himself. While police acknowledge the two met on a forum for cannibals, described online as 'the #1 site for exotic meat', they say no evidence of cannibalism could be found. Instead the indictment against Guenzel cites 'satisfaction of sexual lust' as a motive in the killing. He could face 15 years in prison if convicted on charges of murder and 'disturbing the peace of the dead' by the court in the eastern city of Dresden. According to investigators Guenzel met Stempniewicz for the first time on a forum for cannibalism fetishists in October last year. During the trial a 50-minute video will be shown in which Guenzel mutilates the naked body of Stempniewicz while it hangs by a hook wearing nothing but his underwear . The two kept in contact via email, text message and telephone before finally arranging the fatal date for November 4. Gunezel . picked Stempniewicz up at Dresden's main railway station and drove him . back to his house in Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau which he ran as a bed and . breakfast with his male partner. Police cannot prove that Guenzel ate any of his victim, but say that his genitals have never been found . Prosecutors . allege that Gunezel then took his victim to the basement where he . strangled him using a rope tied to a pulley before chopping the corpse . up into small pieces. However . the defence team argue that the video shows Stempniewicz had his feet . in constant contact with the ground, meaning he could have stopped the . strangulation if he had wanted to. Gunezel then spent a total of four hours cutting the body up with a knife and saw, before burying it in shallow holes the garden. Officers traced him via computer messages and telephone calls and he was arrested at the police HQ where he worked as a handwriting specialist. When police arrived at the property he showed them where the pieces were buried, but officers say the victim's penis has never been found. The case mirrors that of Armin Meiwes, a man found guilty of killing, dismembering and eating computer technician Bernd Brandes at his remote farmhouse home near Kassel. Meiwes, now serving life imprisonment, packaged the flesh of his 16-stone victim into neat parcels which he froze and ate portions of over a ten month period. When police finally arrived to arrest him there was less than 40lbs of Brandes remaining. Guenzel's trial  is expected to last until November. His partner, who has since left him, will be among the witnesses scheduled to appear. Prosecutors . allege that Gunezel strangled his victim before the grisly . dismemberment took place, while defence lawyers say that the video will . prove Stempniewicz hanged himself .

"The body of a British woman who collapsed and died in Austria following a trip to Nigeria is being tested for the deadly Ebola virus, authorities have confirmed. The unnamed 48-year-old was found dead in the flat she owned in the town of Vomp, in the Tyrol, on Saturday after completing her journey home from the West African nation, which included a stop-over in Germany. Amid growing fears over a possible spread of the disease beyond West Africa, it was revealed today that the corpse of a Nigerian woman who died shortly after touching down in United Arab Emirates . capital Abu Dhabi yesterday was also being tested for Ebola. Austrian officials today confirmed that they have implemented emergency measures and sent a blood and urine sample to the Centre for Tropical Diseases in Hamburg, Germany, after the doctor who attended the scene gave the cause of death as a viral infection. Scroll down for video . Concern: The unnamed 48-year-old was found dead in the flat she owned in the town of Vomp (pictured), in the Tyrol, on Saturday after completing her journey home from the West African nation, which included a stop-over in Germany . Police were alerted to the fact that there might be a problem when a relative had contacted them to say they could not contact the woman. If confirmed, it would be the first case of the virus in Europe. However, Franz Katzgraber, head of the regional health board, said the risk that the woman had died from the Ebola virus was 'extremely low.' 'We have decided to get a diagnosis for exclusion of  ebola,' he said. Spreading: The Ebola virus has killed more than 1,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since the outbreak began in March, and four people have died in Nigeria since it was brought to Lagos (pictured) by a Liberian man on July 20 . 'The 48-year-old recently entered Germany from Nigeria and we could not determine the history of the deceased.' Her apartment has been sealed and officers who found the body have undergone medical counselling and inspection. The Ebola outbreak in . West Africa was first reported in March, and has rapidly become the . deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976. More than 2,000 people have died of the virus, prompting the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare an International Public Health Emergency. Countries with confirmed Ebola* (Cases/deaths): . Total - 2127/1145 . Suspected cases elsewhere (suspected case2/deaths): . *Latest figures as of August 15 2014 (source: WHO) 'All possible precautions have been taken,' according to the Health Ministry.  'All persons who had been with the corpse in Tyrol would have worn protective clothing. He confirmed that it was nevertheless vital to implement emergency measures even when there was just a suspicion, adding that even if the woman did turn out to have died from Ebola, it was . unlikely to have passed on to anyone else as the infection is . only transmitted through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids of . an infected person. He said that in Nigeria so far only one person has died from the virus and the risk of catching it from a trip there was low, and it was much more likely if somebody had come in from Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone. The woman's home has in the meantime been sealed off and emergency services staff including medics who found the body have been quarantined. Although a British citizen, the woman . appears to have had a property in Austria although it was not explained . whether it was a holiday home or whether she lived in the Alpine . Republic. It comes hours after a Nigerian woman who arrived on a flight to the United Arab Emirates . capital of Abu Dhabi and later died in the city may have been infected . with the Ebola virus, said health officials. The health authority in the emirate said in a statement carried by the . Emirati state news agency WAM on Sunday evening that the 35-year-old . woman was traveling from Nigeria to India for treatment of advanced . metastatic cancer. Her health deteriorated while in transit at Abu Dhabi International . Airport and as medics were trying to resuscitate her, they found signs . that suggested a possible Ebola virus infection. Low risk: However, Austrian authorities say the risk that the woman had died from the Ebola virus (pictured) was 'extremely low' It comes as Nigeria confirmed 12 more cases of the Ebola virus, up from 10 at last week's count, of which five have almost fully recovered, the Health Ministry said on Monday. It said in a statement that 189 people in Lagos and six others in the southeastern city of Enugu were under surveillance. The death toll remains four, it said. A doctor who had recovered had been discharged from hospital, the ministry said. The Ebola virus has killed more than 1,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since the outbreak began in March, and four people have died in Nigeria since it was brought to Lagos by a Liberian man on July 20. 'Patients under treatment have now been moved to the new 40 bed capacity isolation ward provided by the Lagos state government,' the Health Ministry statement said. It added that experimental drugs were in the process of being cleared for the treatment of Ebola, although one, nano silver, had been rejected because it did not meet requirements. What is Ebola virus disease? Ebola . is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per . cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, . gorillas and chimpanzees. How do people become infected with the virus? Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In . Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with . chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and . porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. Once . a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a . sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also . become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled . clothing, bed linen or used needles. Men . who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to . their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. Who is most at risk? Those at risk during an outbreak include: . What are the typical signs and symptoms? Sudden . onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore . throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney . and liver function and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms. When should you seek medical care? If . a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact . with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek . medical help immediately. What is the treatment? Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them. But . there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients . will recover with the appropriate care.Can Ebola be prevented? Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use. Is it safe to travel to affected areas? The . World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation . regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The . risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person . transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.","The 48-year-old British national died at home in Vomp, Austria, on Saturday .

"Nazi hunters in Germany are on the trail of 17 more former S.S. guards who worked at the death camp of Majdanek in occupied Poland during the Second World War. Four women are among the suspects said to have helped herd innocent victims into the gas chambers - or who were part of mass shooting parties - which claimed the lives of between 80,000 and 150,000 people, most of them Jews. Majdanek was a hybrid facility which also served as a concentration camp and a source of slave labour. Majdanek (above and below) was a hybrid facility which also served as a concentration camp and a source of slave labour . Located on the outskirts of Lublin in eastern Poland, it was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944 and remains the best preserved Holocaust site with intact gas chambers and crematoria. Germany’s Central Investigation Agency for Nazi War Crimes recently tracked down several Auschwitz camp guards in the country and handed files over to various regional prosecutors who are now mulling charges against them. Auschwitz was first constructed to hold Polish political prisoners, who began to arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941 . Kurt Schrimm, the director of the agency based in Ludwigsburg, wants to level charges of complicity in mass murder against the Majdanek guards. Files on three of the suspects have already been handed to prosecutors with Schrimm admitting: 'The evidence is somewhat problematical.' By that he means that there remain no witnesses alive able to testify to the alleged crimes committed by the guards. But he hopes that the case of John Demjanjuk will serve as the blueprint in any forthcoming trials. Demjanjuk was convicted of assisting in the mass murder of 28,000 Jews at the extermination camp of Sobibor, where 250,000 of the six million victims of the Holocaust were murdered. John Demjanjuk (in the wheelchair) was convicted of war crimes without any evidence or testimony against him. Judges decided that it was enough that he had served as a guard at Sobibor concentration camp. He died on March 17, 2012 . He was convicted in Munich in 2011 without a shred of testimony about what he did in the camp: judges ruled for the first time that it was enough for him to have have served there for him to be guilty of aiding the Nazis in their criminal enterprise. Schrimm went on: 'Majdanek is a very complicated camp and for us because there were no demarcated areas for the killings as in other Nazi camps.' Indeed research is continuing at the site of the camp - now a memorial and museum - to try to ascertain the correct numbers of those murdered there. 'We have little material, the information we have is not optimal,' admitted Schrimm,. Age and infirmity could mean that some, perhaps all, of the S.S.killers from Majdanek will not be brought to trial. Of the recent Auschwitz suspects rounded up with the help of the Nazi hunters of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Israel, nine have been judged incapable of standing trial, four were let go because of lack of evidence, four more have since died, one was released because he had already served time for war crimes in Poland and 14 more cases are still being considered by public prosecutors across Germany.","Majdanek was a concentration camp on the outskirts of Lublin in eastern Poland but also provided slave labour for the Germans .

"Michael Schumacher is no longer in a coma and has been transferred from the hospital in Grenoble where he had been receiving treatment to the University Hospital Lausanne in Switzerland . The battle for Michael Schumacher's coma recovery has apparently entered a new phase with him being moved out of intensive care into a rehabilitation ward. If true, it means that Schumacher, 45, is out of danger from dying from his injuries - but the level of progress he has made remains questionable. It comes four months after doctors announced they would begin the process of awaking him from the . artificially induced coma he was placed in following a ski accident in . the French Alps on December 19 last year. However, experts say if he was going to wake up, he would have done so by now. Medical sources always said that there would come a point when doctors would have to inform his wife Corinna, brother Ralf and father Rolf that there is nothing more they can do for him on the emergency station. A rehab ward means he will still receive the same massage therapy and muscle toning that he has been getting daily but that doctors no longer expect significant improvements - certainly in the short term - in his condition. 'Schumacher's transfer to a special rehabilitation clinic is being prepared and the chances of full recovery have dropped,' said Bunte. Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm has not resonded to the latest report in Germany's popular weekly magazine Bunte. The Abendzeitung in Munich also quoted unnamed medical sources saying that he had been moved within the hospital. It has been more than five months since Schumacher's tragic skiing crash in the slopes of Meribel in the French Alps. The seven-time world champion's family and manager last spoke about Schumacher's health condition in the middle of April, stating that the German ace has 'moments of consciousness and awakening.' Since then there have been no fresh updates, fuelling speculation that he will not make a full recovery. The seven-times Formula One world champion had sustained severe head injuries in the incident in the French Alps in December, and was subsequently put into an artificially-induced coma a few days later . Schumi in a coma, unable to speak or move, is still able to dominate newspaper headlines and TV broadcasts from Alaska to Zagreb yet fears remain that he is in a permanent vegative state. Most patients in an artificial coma come around after a fortnight: Schumi is in his sixth month in such a condition. There has been no flicker of the eyes, no flexing of a fingertip, no uttered sound. Just the blipping of the machinery that feeds him, medicates him, breathes for him and removes the waste from a body that has lost a quarter of its weight since the Alpine accident robbed him of the life he knew. Last week it was reported Schumacher's coma recovery had apparently entered a new phase with him being moved out of intensive care into a rehabilitation ward . The greatest: Schumacher is a seven-time Formula One World Champion and is widely regarded as one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time . With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts. Corinna knows it is the least she can do for the man she described as the 'perfect partner.' She and Schumacher met in 1991 on the F1 circuit after she was previously married to racing driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen. She once said: 'Michael's passion for racing is just huge, it would have been impossible without this deep passion; this passion has made him, who he is. I got to know him as a racer, and I had previously always had fullest confidence in him.' But she made him promise after a 2009 motorcycle accident in Spain that almost landed him in a wheelchair that the days of thrills and spills must be tempered. Out of love, he toned down his lifestyle. He referred to his marriage as 'total harmony,' adding: 'We have the same vision of how we want to spend our lives. My wife Corinna and our harmonious family - that is my main force always at play in the background.' That is why 'she would view breaking faith with the hope of a miracle a betrayal, little better than treachery,' added the family friend. 'She feels that the family communes around his bedside pulsate their hope and love to him, and that of the millions of fans worldwide who share that faith. She cannot express defeat because that would be the end of her.'","If true, it means Schumacher, 45, is out of danger from dying from injuries .

Lip-smackingly good: Diners that have tried the $35 lion taco say it is worth the money . One person tweeted to the restaurants twitter account @TacoFusion 'You people are disgusting. Shame on you for further destroying this environment,' another wrote: 'That is disgusting and disturbing!.' 'How dare you serve this,” Jennifer Rieger Hauck wrote on Taco Fusion’s Facebook page. 'I truly hope your restaurant goes out of business very soon and you end up living on the street.' Undeterred, Taco Fusion officials posted a reply to critics: 'If you guys are mad now, just wait till you see what we do next.' Lion is endangered but it's legal to sell and eat in the United States. The restaurant says its lion meat came from a reputable vendor in Illinois. The lion meat doesn't come cheap. At $225 per pound each taco is on the menu for $35. Taco Fusion’s manager Brad Barnett advised those who opposed the item not to eat it. 'Our . whole thought process of bringing the exotic meats to the Tampa Bay . area was to give people the opportunity to try different things that . they normally wouldn't get to try,' says Brad.

Jeff . Kremer from Big Cat Rescue that rescues lions and similar large cats, . questioned Taco Fusion’s decision. 'There is obviously an animal welfare . concern and there is a bigger picture. The bigger concern is where do . we, as society, draw the line for what is acceptable for moral and . ethical behavior,' Kremer said. 'Restaurants will do this to just draw . attention, for the novelty. It’s just a disgrace in my opinion.' Frank . Consoli went there for lunch: 'It’s a bit tougher than steak,' he said . after taking his first bite while sitting on the veranda. 'Roughly as . chewy as a flank steak,' he said, 'with a powerful red-meat flavor and a . strong 'gamey' finish. Mixed response: Online not everyone shares Taco Fusion's enthusiasm for their exotic dishes . Pricey: The lion tacos sell for $35 each. The restaurant says it has now sold out and will not be restocking . He’s eaten rattlesnake and antelope before, he told the Tampa Tribune . 'Man it’s delicious.

Initially, . the restaurant planned on selling lion tacos as long as people . continued buying them but this weekend the Taco Fusion has decided to . discontinue the dish because of the negative publicity. 'We're getting all kinds of threats over it,' said Ryan Gougeon, the owner. 'Now we're getting bomb threats, and everything else.

'How . is a cow that is injected with hormones, crammed in a dark pen it's . whole life, and then unceremoniously slaughtered any better than a . hormone free- free range animal that was raised for meat consumption,' the restaurant asks in a blog post.

"A former major league pitcher who played for the New York Yankees and the Oakland Athletics has died in a climbing accident near his hometown in Texas. Brad Halsey, 33, was killed near his home outside New Braunfels, Texas, on Friday, his family says. He pitched for three seasons in the major leagues, starting with the Yankees in 2004. He played for the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Oakland Athletics, before being sent down to the minor leagues and retiring from baseball. Brad Halsey, 33, seen here in 2004, died on Friday after an accident near his home in New Braunfels in central Texas. No details are available . He had a record of 14-19 with am ERA of 4.84. He appeared in 88 games and made 40 starts in the majors. He returned to his hometown of New Braunfels, a city of 60,000 30 miles outside San Antonio. USA Today reports that Halsey died Friday in a climbing accident. The details of his death were not immediately available. O'Connell Sports, the Halsey's former agent, announced his death on Tuesday night. 'We are sorry to hear of the passing of longtime client, Brad Halsey. Our thoughts & prayers are with his family during this difficult time,' the agency tweeted. The Yankees drafted Halsey out of the University of Texas in 2002. He spent the next two seasons playing minor league ball before being called in to the majors in 2004. Halsey played three seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees, the Oakland Athletics and the Arizona Diamondbacks . The Yankees traded him to the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2005 as part of a deal for pitching great Randy Johnson. In 2006, he was traded to the Oakland A's, where he gained two the top infamous moments of his career. He threw the pitch that Barry Bonds hit for his 714th career home run, tying Babe Ruth. In 2007, he angrily criticized the A's front office for refusing to call him up to the majors from Triple-A Sacramento when he had an MRI scheduled. He claimed at the time that the team was only trying to avoid paying him the higher major league rates if he had to go on the disabled list. 'Then they send you down and screw you. I'm grinding it out, trying to be a team guy, and I get f***ed.

"This is the dramatic moment rescue workers finally began the process of winching a cave explorer to safety after he spent a week trapped 3,200 feet below ground. Johann . Westhauser, 52, suffered serious head injuries seven days ago while exploring . the Alpine Riesending cave system near the Berchtesgaden, close to the Austrian . border. The £2million process to bring him to the surface is expected to take several days, but finally got under way after doctors assisted . by 200 rescue specialists climbed two and half miles down into the cave to treat Mr Westhauser and make sure he was well enough to be . brought out. Scroll down for videos . Transport: Rescue workers finally started the process of winching injured cave explorer Johann Westhauser to safety yesterday after he spent a week trapped 3,200 feet below ground . Rescuers had strapped Mr Westhauser to a stretcher (pictured), as they transported him through the labyrinth . The first words Mr Westhauser uttered upon seeing Italian rescue workers approach him on Saturday morning were: 'I am feeling OK.' After two days treating him inside the caves, rescuers finally strapped Mr Westhauser to a stretcher, with the process to carry him out of the network of tunnels now well under way. 'We are very glad that the patient is able to tolerate the transport so well,' doctor Johannes Schiffer said. But it will still take several more days to get Mr Westhauser to the surface.He has a heating system and a neck brace attached to him in a bid to avoid further brain swelling on his journey back to the light. Some German media reported that doctors considered boring into his skull while underground to relieve pressure on his brain, but it is unclear whether this procedure was actually carried out. A graphic shows where the cave explorer was stuck - far from the entrance of the complex cave system . Brave: Rescuers at the entrance of the Riesending cave prepare to make the 3,200 foot journey below ground to bring Johann Westhauser to the surface . Speed: The mission to rescue Mr Westhauser is becoming a race against time. Storms are forecast for the area where the cave entrance (pictured) is located . Johann Westhauser may have been trapped for a week, but a group of Chilean miners hold the world record for surviving the longest time stuck below ground. The 33 men were trapped for a total of 69 days following the collapse of the San José copper-gold mine on August 5, 2010. It wasn't until October 13 that the last miner was lifted to safety in a tiny capsule that could only hold one person at a time and took a full 15 minutes to reach the surface. All 33 miners survived the traumatic ordeal, with almost all of them in a good medical condition with no long-term physical effects. Part of their incredible feat of survival was due to a spirit among the men that they must simply accept their situation and not panic. Despite having . suffered a serious brain injury, certain passages within the caves are so narrow that the explorer will be expected to get up and walk himself. Foam, of the type used in building to insulate walls, has been sprayed on him to both cushion and warm him on his journey. He is also medicated - tranquilized, in effect - to keep him calm in the cold, pitch darkness where progress is agonisingly slow. There are, for example, five shafts measuring 200 feet each, that he must be pulled up with only a few centimetres between him and the dripping rock face. Mr Westhauser was seriously injured by a falling rock while he was wearing a helmet during the early hours of last Sunday morning. By . the time a paramedic reached his side he was already showing the first . signs of hypothermia, as the temperature in the spot where he is lying . underground never reaches above 3C. It . can only be reached by crawling through a labyrinth of tiny spaces, . rappelling down sheer drops and making difficult climes in the pitch . dark. Going underground: The £2million process to bring Johann Westhauser to the surface is expected to take several days. Doctors assisted by 200 rescue specialists have climbed two and half miles down into the cave . Support: Infrastructure for the rescue team has been set up near the entrance to the Riesending cave . If weather makes air support impossible, the Bavarian Mountain Rescue service (members of which are pictured) says it will make the trips using pack mules . Mr Westhauser, who . works as a physicist in Karlsruhe, is strapped into a specialised . stretcher, wrapped in a sleeping bag and layers of styrofoam to keep him . warm. A . doctor with the rescue party is carrying a skull drill in case he . begins to suffer bleeding on the brain, which could cause the pressure . in his skull to rise to dangerous levels. The . mission to bring out Mr Westhauser is becoming a race against time. Storms are . forecast for the area where the cave entrance is located. Heavy rain . could flood the cave, which acts as a drainage system for the mountains. Helicopters have been . making up to ten trips a day to the entrance to the cave system, which . is 6,000ft up in the Bavarian Alps. If weather makes air support . impossible, the Bavarian Mountain Rescue service says it will make the . trips using pack mules. A rescuer explores the Riesending cave where an explorer is currently lying injured 3,200ft below . Specialist rescue workers from Switzerland and Italy have arrived to help with the arduous rescue effort, which could take up to several more days and even weeks . German . newspapers are already beginning to ask questions about the cost of the . rescue operation, but authorities are refusing to comment on how much . has been spent. Stefan .

"A teenage boy playing with a stolen gun accidentally shot and killed his 12-year-old friend then, moments later committed suicide when he realized what he had done, authorities in Utah have revealed. The double tragedy in November 2013 rocked the city of South Jordan, Utah, where both boys lived and attended school.

He plans to launch his political career with a visit to support anti-fracking protesters at Barton Moss in Salford this weekend. He said: ‘I've been saying we need a revolution and there's no good shouting about it when you're not actually doing anything. ‘If you want to do something about things you've got to get into the corridors of power and take them on.’ The keen beekeeper said he wants to create a 'permacultural society where we'll end illness' including dementia and cancer .

He told the Manchester Evening News: ‘If you're voting for me, you're voting as a protest about what's happening in the world at the moment. ‘I'm going to create a new world order and get rid of them and start again with a new, fairer system without evil being the main policy.’ The maraca-shaker found fame as a dancer with Shaun Ryder's Happy Mondays and later Black Grape .

"As the saying goes, 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away,' - now research suggests that eating large amounts of fruit and vegetables every day can keep the therapist away, too. A study by The University of Queensland has found that eight or more portions every 24 hours drastically improves mental wellbeing.

Scroll down for video . The study from The University of Queensland found that eight or more portions of fruit and vegetables every day drastically improves mental wellbeing . The study found the current Australian guidelines fruits and vegetables do not account for psychological effects . 'The current guidelines for five vegetables and two fruits per day are based on physical health. We wanted to look at the effect fruit and vegetables have on life satisfaction, distress and overall vitality,' he said. 'The existing guidelines need to be reviewed. Our research found that eating five fruits and vegetables a day is ideal, and less than ten per cent of Australians are eating this amount.' Dr Mujcic said that although it may sound expensive, the study accounted for socio-economic factors, as it was correlated from household studies. He claimed international studies support his case. 'There was one study from the UK and one from New Zealand which found that people are at their happiest with eight portions of fruit and vegetables,' he said. Other results from the study found that fruit has a larger impact on mental health than vegetables, and women experience more of a mental health benefit than men.

"The son of a Broadway veteran was caught shoplifting from a Manhattan drug store early Thursday. His loot of choice: toothbrushes and toothpaste. Ben Vereen Jr. is also alleged to have snagged some cellphone charges in the strange early morning crime at an Upper West Side CVS, reports Page Six. His namesake father is 68-year-old Tony winning actor Ben Vereen. According to Page Six, police say Vereen Jr. stole the items in the CVS store on 87th Street and Amsterdam Avenue around 5:30am. The son of Tony-winning actor Ben Vereen (who is pictured here) was arrested early Thursday after allegedly trying to shoplift toothbrushes and toothpaste from a Manhattan CVS store, Page Six is reporting . He allegedly put up a fight when a store security guard tried putting a stop to his antics. Page Six reports: .

Ben Vereen Sr., who'd yet to speak out on the Page Six report Thursday afternoon, won Tony in 1972 for his performance in Broadway's Pippin. He's also became well known for his  portrayal of Chicken George in 1977s classic mini-series Roots. Along with his many other professional accomplishments, Vereen has had personal setbacks. He and then-wife Andrea Townsley lost their 16-year-old daughter Naja in a tragic New Jersey car crash in 1987. He subsequently fell into a serious cocaine addiction. He managed to kick the habit in a rehab stint. However, just after his release Vereen was nearly killed when he was hit by a car while walking alongside the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. His injuries forced him into months of physical rehabilitation. Despite all that, Vereen made a career comeback in the 1990s.

"A woman who provided false alibis for two honeymoon killers in Antigua has been jailed for six years. Georgette Aaron tried to thwart police investigations into the brutal murders of Welsh couple Ben and Catherine Mullany on the holiday island in 2008. Local men Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell were later convicted for killing newlyweds Mr and Mrs Mullany as well as local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson. Mother-of-two Aaron told officers she had been with her teenage lover Howell and accomplice Martin at the time when the Mullanys were shot. Antiguan prosecutor Adlai Smith said her statements to police were a deliberate attempt to derail a major police investigation. Jailed: Georgette Aaron tried to thwart police investigations into the brutal murders of Welsh couple Ben and Catherine Mullany on the holiday island in 2008 . Judge Justice Albert Redhead said he had no choice but to jail Aaron, who continued to lie through her trial. At a hearing in Antigua's High Court last Friday, he said: 'You persisted in making a false alibi, knowing that the murders had been committed.' Mr Mullany and his wife Catherine, both 31, were both shot in the head while on honeymoon. They had been married a mere fortnight when Martin and Howell burst into their hotel chalet at 5am on July 27 while brandishing a Glock pistol. After gunning down the Welsh newlyweds in cold blood, Martin and Howell then went on to kill a local shopkeeper Ms Anderson in almost identical circumstances less than a fortnight later.

Tragic: The 31-year-olds, who lived in Rhos, near Pontardawe, were both shot in the head while their killers made off with their mobile phones, a cheap digital camera and a handful of cash . Judge Justice Albert Redhead said he had no choice but to jail Aaron, who continued to lie through her trial . Morriston Hospital doctor Mrs Mullany died instantly, while her widower was flown back to Wales on a life support machine via a specialist air ambulance. But despite the best efforts of his wife's medical colleagues, he died a week after the shooting. Martin and Howell were arrested and charged in August 2008, but did not stand trial until June 2011. Despite them both making not guilty pleas, both men refused to give evidence in court. The pair were later given full life sentences. Earlier this year, Howell - also known by the street name 'demon' - was shot and killed by police after escaping from prison. He and Martin were also charged with two other murders in 2008. Murder scene: Howell and Martin burst into Mr and Mrs Mullany's chalet at the Cocos Hotel (pictured) in a dawn raid in July 2008 . Fighting for life: Qualified doctor Mrs Mullany died instantly while physiotherapy student husband - who was studying for his degree at the University of West England, Bristol - was flown home on a life-support machine (pictured). He died a week later . Happy together: The couple's family were said to be 'extremely shocked' at the news that one of the killers had been able to escape . Sources say 'they are doubtful' whether Martin will ever stand trial for those killings. However, at Aaron's hearing last week prosecutor Mr Smith said he was convinced Howell and Martin would have gone to kill more had they not been caught when they were. Following the hearing, prosecutor Mr Smith said: 'We echo the sentiments of the learned trial judge, Justice Albert Redhead, that the court should take a dim view of persons trying to assist others to evade justice.' Mr and Mrs Mullany's name lives on via the charity The Mullany Fund, which aims to help people from less well off backgrounds get into medicine.","Ben and Catherine Mullany were shot on the holiday island in 2008 .

"Killed: Jason Richard Stevens, 39, of Scotland, died on the way to hospital after being shot several times . A British translator has been killed after trying to negotiate with a gunman during a robbery at a bar in Brazil. The victim - named locally as Jason Richard Stevens, 39, from Scotland - died on the way to hospital after being shot several times as he played a snooker-style game in Sao Paulo. He had just celebrated his 39th birthday a few days earlier. Police said two men burst into the bar in the upmarket neighbourhood of Interlagos in the south of the city around 11pm on Wednesday. The gunman is said to have stood by the doorway and acted as a lookout while his accomplice went round the bar collecting up customers' personal belongings. The victim was shot as he tried to talk to the gunman. One report said he was trying to calm him down after he started getting agitated when he saw some customers refuse to hand over belongings and try to overpower his accomplice. He was shot several times in the stomach, leg and arms. Witnesses have told police the two gunmen fled in a black Ford Fiesta driven by a getaway driver. Police have since revealed that the robbers got away with less than £200, police said. Mr Stevens is understood to have lived in Brazil with parents Vicky and Richard and siblings Nina and Mark since he was a child. He attended St Paul's, the main school in São Paulo for British expats before studying tourism at a local university. He then worked as a freelance translator with his own company, JRS Consultancy. Mr Stevens is understood to have lived in Brazil with parents Vicky and Richard and siblings Nina and Mark since he was a child . Mr Stevens, a father, worked as a freelance translator with his own company, JRS Consultancy . He is believed to have once had a French-Brazilian wife and was the father to a teenage daughter who friends say he described as the love of his life. His friend Melina Revuelta said: 'I'm deeply sad and overwhelmed by his passing. 'We've worked together several times and I'll never forget his genuine smile and the way he cheered up everybody at every event. 'He used to sing  for the girls serving coffee in high-profile events in São Paulo, it was very cool.' Another, Michael Gannan, said: 'Jason was a guy who touched people's lives in many meaningful ways. He was caring and always watching over everyone making sure we were comfortable. 'He was a loving friend, a caring son and father. It's a huge loss.' Monica Costa Almeida said: 'He was a fine guy, literally adored by everyone.' According to friends, he was a scout as a child and regularly enjoyed trips back to the UK. As an 'Old Paulean', he remained close to his old school in São Paulo. Murder squad detectives are probing the killing and were still hunting the killers last night. Bar owner Fumihiro Yoshima said he believed the gunman may have panicked because he felt threatened by 6ft, 2in tall Mr Stevens, who also worked as a language consultant. He said: ‘I think the robber shot him because he felt scared at how tall and strong he was.’ The dead man was playing sinuca, a type of Brazilian snooker, when the gunmen struck. Great guy: Friends and colleague paid tribute to him today, as 'a fine guy, literally adored by everyone' Scene: Police said two men burst into the bar (above) in the upmarket neighbourhood of Interlagos in Sao Paulo . In an updated statement, the state security ministry of São Paulo said the case was being investigated by its homicide unit but no suspects had yet been arrested. The spokesman said: 'The interpreter Jason Richard Stevens, 39, died during a robbery in a bar around 11pm on Wednesday, October 22, on Rua João Sobrinho in the south zone of São Paulo. 'The victim was in a bar when two men, one of them armed, announced a robbery. One of the suspects stayed at the door while the other collected the belongings of customers. 'Jason talked to the armed man, and then walked in his direction but didn’t behave threateningly. The criminal shot him and the two robbers escaped. 'They ran to the next street where the third suspect was waiting in a black Ford Fiesta. 'Jason was taken to hospital but was dead when he arrived. Experts were called and the case was registered with police.' There is not believed to have been CCTV in the humble street bar in the south zone of São Paulo where the robbery happened.

The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that Charles Russo, 30, had been disciplined by the hotel before for inappropriate behavior with clients, though the incident was never reported to authorities and he was allowed to continue working at the hotel. Charles Russo, 30, is accused of pleasuring himself and ejaculating on a client's feet after she paid him for a massage at the tony Ritz-Carlton spa in New Orleans . Massage prices range from $145 for a 50-minute rubdown to $275 for 80 minutes of specialized 'Royal Four-Hands' massage therapy. Rooms at the Ritz-Carlton range from $219 a night to up to $6,000 for the Presidential Suite on the top floor of the hotel in the city's French Quarter. The victim reported the assault on Jun 1, 2013. Police arrested Russo on Sunday. It's not clear why New Orleans police detectives took 16 months to act on the case. The hotel has refused to comment on whether Russo is still employed or whether he was allowed to continue working while under investigation for the attack. He faces a charge of sexual battery. State records show his massage therapist license, which must be renewed and updated every year, is still active. In arrest records, Russo listed that he works at at different spa now, La Vie De Luxe Salon & Spa in Kenner, Louisiana. The owner of the spa said Russo resigned before his arrest.

"Britons have always been known for their stoicism. And when these young men were sent to German prison camps during the First World War, they rolled up their sleeves and made the best of it. Using the barbed wire parameter as a trellis, a group of gardeners transformed a bleak abandoned racecourse in the middle of the Ruhleben internment camp into a flourishing garden. A group of gardeners set up a horticultural society while at a German camp during the First World War . It began with the men growing sweet peas in biscuits tins, but they were soon using thousands of flowers to cover the harsh barbed wire which lined the camp . By the end of the war, the team were growing more than 80 different types of sweet peas, dahlias and chrysanthemums at the Berlin camp . It began with the men growing sweet peas in biscuits tins. But soon, they had set up a horticultural society and crafted their own 'mini Chelsea', using thousands of flowers which hung from the barbed wire. They made their own greenhouses, installed their own boiler and set up their own cold frames. They even hosted their own internal flower shows, governed by RHS rules. And, by the end of the war, the society - which had more than 900 members - was growing more than 80 different types of sweet peas, chrysanthemums and dahlias at the Berlin camp. It was all made possible by the Royal Horticultural Society in London, with which the camp's dedicated horticultural society was affiliated since it began in 1916. The RHS recruited help from volunteers to send packages of seeds and bulbs to the camp through the Red Cross. Despite food being scarce - and being sent bulbs by the dozen - the gardeners focused more on flowers, attempting to turn the bleak camp into something more homely. But they did more than just dabble in vegetable growing. At its peak, the society was producing 33,000 lettuces and 18,000 bunches of radishes, which they used to supplement their diet. They also produced pumpkins, cauliflower and potatoes, which they shared with fellow inmates  - and even sold some to the Germans. Despite food being scarce, the gardeners mainly worked on flowers (right), although they did dabble in vegetables, including pumpkins (left) The garden - described as a 'mini Chelsea' - was started in the middle of an abandoned race course . They managed to keep their garden flourishing by using packages of seeds and bulbs which were sent to the camp through the Red Cross . Now, the story of one of those men is being featured as part of the Gardens at War exhibition at the Garden Museum in London. David MacKay Tulloch, a merchant seaman, spent four years working on the garden at the camp -  a hobby he continued when he returned to the UK. His talent was passed through three generations, with his daughter Eva Tulloch and granddaughter Doreen Black both keen gardeners. His great-granddaughter Emily is now a garden designer. Mr Tulloch's incredible story was discovered after the RHS launched a campaign, searching for relatives of the Ruhleben gardeners. The society wanted their stories to be added to the photographs, letters and paintings sent to the RHS in London by  Ruhleben. The dedicated society was affiliated with the Royal Horticultural Society in London . The gardeners also dabbled in growing fruit, which they even sold to some on the Germans in the camp . Entrants to the Spring Flower Show held on March 30, 1918 . Doreen, 68, who lives in Dunblane, Scotland, said: 'He learnt all his gardening skills in Ruhleben and carried on when he returned home after the war. 'He always had big gardens to grow his fruit and vegetables and grew wonderful begonias and sweet peas. He was still gardening until he died at the age of 94. 'I have very strong memories of helping him pick strawberries. He'd always get me to whistle as I picked so I wouldn't be tempted to eat them.' David Tulloch was sailing from Aberdeen to Hamburg with the merchant navy when war was declared in 1914. David Tulloch with his wife Margaret outside their home in Glasgow. His story features in an exhibition entitled Gardens and War . David Tulloch with granddaughter Doreen Black and dog Moraig. He continued gardening until he was 94 . He was incarcerated in hulks on the River Elb with his crew mates, until the Red Cross appealed and they were sent to Ruhleben. He was among 5,000 British citizens at the overcrowded camp, which was described when it opened as 'scandalously inadequate' and 'not fit to keep pigs in.' The prisoners worked together to transform the camp into a self-governing society, with its own newspapers, postal service and clubs. The Ruhleben Horticultural Society, which had 900 members, was started in 1916 and became affiliated to the British RHS society. The front cover of a membership card for the Ruhleben Horticultural Society . Doreen added: 'The prisoners built all their own greenhouses and cold frames and even had a boiler, which they had to keep going through the night. 'They grew vegetables on about half the racecourse and grew huge numbers of cauliflowers and leeks and potatoes. In the end they were even selling vegetables to the Germans. 'It's amazing what they managed to achieve and how the gardening took off. They even had flower and vegetable shows following RHS rules. 'It was like a mini Chelsea in the middle of a German internment camp.' Tulloch's daughter Eva inherited his greenfingers and continued to garden until she was 90. Today his great-granddaughter Emily Allen has become a garden designer and his great-grandson Duncan Black has a huge allotment. 'Grandpa passed on his knowledge and love of gardening to us all. I think he would be proud of Duncan's potato plot,' added Doreen. Fiona Davison, head of Libraries and Exhibitions at the Royal Horticultural Society, says the society gradually grew from modest beginnings. She said: 'The story of the Ruhleben Horticultural Society is a remarkable tale of the power of gardening to improve people’s quality of life, even in the most adverse conditions. 'Starting with miniature gardens in biscuit tins, the inmates of Ruhleben set up a flourishing horticultural society, complete with flower shows, nurseries, hot houses and eventually large scale food production. 'Throughout the war, the RHS mobilised its members and key nurseries to keep the Ruhleben Horticultural Society equipped with seeds, bulbs and advice. 'At its peak the Ruhleben Horticultural Society was producing 33,000 lettuces, 18,000 bunches of radishes and 7,000 pounds of green beans. 'By 1918 these efforts meant that the men in the camp had a much better diet than the native German population which was enduring severe food shortages. 'We put out an appeal to descendants of Ruhleben inmates and we were overwhelmed with responses. We hope that the resulting exhibition shines a light on this little known story from the First World War.'","Inmates at German Ruhleben internment camp set up a horticultural society .

"A mother jailed for murdering her young son in an arson attack has been released from prison after spending 16 years behind bars for a crime she insists she did not commit. Kristine Bunch, 38, was sentenced to 60 years in prison in 1996 after a jury convicted her of pouring kerosene in the bedroom of three-year-old Tony and setting it on fire. But scientific breakthroughs and new evidence has cast doubt on the original conviction. Bunch was greeted by her overjoyed mother Susan Hubbard, 58, and her 16-year-old son, Trenton, after she was released from prison in Greensburg, Indiana, yesterday. Freedom: Kristine Bunch, right, hugs her mother Susan Hubbard, after being released in Greensburg, Indiana, having spent 16 years behind bars for a crime she said she did not commit . Original trial: More than a decade after being convicted and sent to prison for killing her son in a fire, Kristine Bunch's charges for her retrial have been dropped . Freed: Kristine Bunch, 38, was sentenced to 60 years in prison in 1996 after a jury convicted her of pouring kerosene in the bedroom of three-year-old Tony and setting it on fire . 1995 arrest: The original trial heard that Bunch poured kerosene in the bedroom of her son and the living room of their mobile home before setting it ablaze . Taking in her first breaths of freedom in 16 years, a jubilant Bunch said she looked forward to doing . the everyday things that most people take for granted, like shopping, . eating out, and using the Internet, which she has never seen. ‘I can learn how to Facebook,’ she said. ‘All my friends tell me they're on Facebook.’ Victim: Tony was three-years-old when he died from carbon monoxide poisoning . She faces a retrial in March, next year, after the Indiana Court of Appeals ruled that the evidence used to convict her was outdated, weak and wrongly withheld from the defence. A Decatur County judge granted her $5,000 cash bail at the suggestion of prosecutors. On June 30, 1995, firefighters were called to Bunch's Greensburg mobile home to find it fully engulfed in flames. She was standing outside and told crews she tried to get to her son, but the flames were too hot. The body of the three-year-old was found huddled between the ashes of a burned bed and wall in a bedroom. The original trial heard that Bunch . poured kerosene in the bedroom of her son and the living room of their . mobile home before setting it ablaze. No clear motive was ever established, but prosecutors said Bunch, of Columbus, Indiana, had asked a friend to take custody of the boy about a year before the fire so she could ‘get away from it all’ and that she had made inconsistent statements about the blaze. Chicago attorney Ron Safer told WTLX.com that the new evidence made it impossible for the fire to have happened the way the state alleged and that tests were incorrect. In actuality, tests showed Tony died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Had the fire been started in his room, as it was alleged, the child would have died of burns from the fire rather than smoke inhalation. Bunch likened her experiences to a nightmare that wouldn't end and said that though she was in a state of shock about being released, she was joyful that she has the chance to prove the conviction was a mistake. 'I haven't been by myself,' she said. 'I had a family that stood by me. I had people that believed in me and stepped up. And you can't receive blessings like that and be bitter.' Scene: On June 30, 1995, firefighters were called to Bunch's Greensburg mobile home to find it fully engulfed in flames. She was standing outside and told crews she tried to get to her son, but the flames were too hot . Horrible tragedy? The body of three-year-old Tony Bunch was found huddled between the ashes of a burned bed and wall in a bedroom . In prison: Bunch earned her GED and a college degree. She said she plans to go to law school. She wants to work in criminal law, representing inmates who have been wrongfully convicted . Life on the outside: Kristine Bunch, left, with her mother Susan Hubbard, says she looks forward to learning how to use Facebook now she has been released from prison . In the meantime, Bunch said she will live with her mother and her son, in nearby Columbus, Indiana. ‘It . was horrible, but I knew if I held on to my faith that justice would . prevail. The truth usually has a way of coming out,’ Hubbard, Bunch's . mother, said. Bunch's attorney, Ron Safer, said prosecutors ‘did exactly the right thing’ by asking for a low bond, but he was disappointed they still planned another trial in light of scientific advances that he said suggest there was no real evidence of arson. Prosecutors have had little to say except that they are seeking a gag order to restrict attorneys' public comments on the case. A hearing on their request is scheduled for August  30, and Bunch was ordered to attend. Bunch said a prison ministry helped her maintain her faith while she was in prison. ‘I knew it was going to work out in the end,’ she said. While locked up, Bunch earned her GED and a college degree. She said she plans to go to law school if acquitted. She wants to work in criminal law, representing inmates who have been wrongfully convicted. ‘There's still a lot of work to be done. There's still a lot of people in my situation,’ Bunch said. The family was taking Bunch out Wednesday night for her first meal besides prison food in years, at a seafood restaurant in Columbus. She now faces a struggle to adjust to life outside of prison -  and adapt to the vast changes which have taken place since her jailing. But of all the technological changes . since she was last out of prison, Bunch said cellphones, which have . evolved from unwieldy boxes with thick antennas to sleek little . machines, impress her the most. ‘I'm amazed by the cellphones,’ she said.","Kristine Bunch, 38, was sentenced to 60 years in prison in 1996 after a jury convicted her of killing three-year-old Tony in arson attack .

"Following the criticisms of a number of Australian brands for producing halal-certified versions of their products, a new target has come under fire. In a post to their Facebook page on Wednesday, one angry chocoholic vowed they would be boycotting Cadbury Dairy Milk products simply because it is halal certified. 'Dear Cadbury Dairy Milk, this is my chocolate purchase for the fortnight, traditionally it would ALL be Cadbury, as it has been for many MANY years,' the consumer wrote alongside a picture of a large number of Lindt Chocolate blocks. One disgruntled customer has taken to social media claiming she will boycott Cadbury chocolate as it is halal . 'But due to Cadbury being Halal Certified, Lindt will have my business from here on in.' When questioned over their decision by other social media users, the angry customer defended their position saying it was not racist, and it was a choice not to 'support any religion'. 'It's not racist, no Religion / Ideology is a race,' they wrote. 'It's about having things forced upon us, against our will. I want to be informed about what I buy. I don't want to support ANY Religion / Ideology, as I don't believe in it. When quizzed by other customers about her strong stance, the woman defended her comments denying she was being intolerant . Some agreed with the comments saying they would also be boycotting the brand . I shouldn't be forced to support it every time I purchase food,' the comment ended. Another used quizzed the decision asking how it was affecting the disgruntled customer personally - and the consumer hit back saying that Cadbury was being deliberately deceptive. 'They're greedy with no morals, and sly enough to hide the label, or not label it at all, so you don't know what you're buying', they wrote. Some fellow chocolate lovers were appalled by the comments, with one woman saying 'chocolate is chocolate! So stupid how people make such a big deal over things like this. Some adults are worse than children!' The same critic claimed that the chocolate brand was being deliberately deceptive . Despite these claims the list of halal certified products is readily available on the Cadbury website . Others supported the decision to boycott the brand, with one user declaring 'Cadbury off my shopping list now too!'. However some people decided to make light of the harsh comments, with one commenter saying he was 'boycotting vegetables as well.' 'Can't stand those pesky vegans forcing me to eat stuff that's got no meat in it just cos (sic) they don't eat meat,' he wrote. 'It's an outrage.' One commenter made light of the situation pointing out how ridiculous the comments were . Another also saw the funny side, claiming he was going to quit eating vegetables . Others found the situation amusing, saying people were making mountains out of molehills . Just last week iconic Australian brands such as Four'N Twenty, Vegemite and even the humble Anzac biscuit were under fierce attack on social media for producing Muslim-friendly halal-certified versions of their products. The Facebook page 'Boycott Halal in Australia' has been set up and aims to 'boycott all companies and organisations that promote or use halal products and services.' The page has  20,000 followers who claim that they will 'not buy halal products & services, because they fund Islamic expansion by any means'. Four'N Twenty and the Byron Bay Cookie Company's Anzac biscuits are the latest to come under attack for introducing a halal certified range of foods. Vegemite and Milo have also come under social media attack for producing halal versions. Scroll down for video . The much-love Australian iconic food brand Four N Twenty has sparked an outrage through social media over its' 'Halal certified' range . Vegemite is among one of the Australian companies being targeted on social media for stocking Halal certified products . The official Four'N Twenty Facebook page was bombarded with complaints for producing halal meat pies and sausage rolls. The number of complaints about their new halal foods has increased in recent months. Four'N Twenty has even been forced to respond individually to some of the Facebook attacks. The Australian pie company has said: 'Halal certified products are a small part of our range and are clearly labelled to ensure everyone can make an informed decision about which Four'N Twenty product is right for them.' Among the consumers declaring they will boycott the company, a few have voiced their support for their decision to introduce halal products. However, the overwhelming majority of Facebook users have been attacking the company's decision to sell halal products. One Perth user posted: 'I believe your company has bowed to Islamic pressure and now pay for your products to be halal certified...is this correct? If so, I will not be buying any of your companies products ever again!' Byron Bay Cookie Company's Anzac biscuits is the latest to come under attack for introducing a halal range . Milo consumers take to the official Facebook page to post against the halal certified products, while Milo has even taken to responding to some comments . Another wrote: 'You say less than 5% of your products are halal certified ..so does that make it ok that you're selling out to Islamic crap rot ..you are still supporting it an the cruelty to animals ..you have lost another customer an i will be letting all know what you have done ...not on ....' One angry buyer even said the family would stop buying Four'N Twenty because it was selling halal certified products. The Four'N Twenty 'Export' Sausage Roll and Meat Pie are certified Halal by the Australian Federation of Islamic Council. The attacks on the Four'N Twenty halal range come despite the fact they are only being sold at specialty stores and produced for export. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Four'N Twenty for comment. Meanwhile, the Northern Star reports the Byron Bay Cookie Company is seeking legal advice after consumers took to their official Facebook page to attack them for their halal Anzac biscuit range. One Facebook user posted 'What a disgrace, the thousands of Anzacs that died on the beaches at Gallipoli will be turning in their graves.' Another posted: 'No Byron Bay anything for me either. I stand firm on boycotting anything Halal. No food should be about religion. No law should be about religion.' Disappointed consumers have expressed their anger over the halal certified range of Four N Twenty foods . Byron Bay Cookie Company is seeking legal advice after consumers took to their official Facebook page to post their disappointment over the company's halal Anzac biscuits . Facebook users have even accused Four N Twenty of supporting terrorism because they have launched a halal range of products . A spokesman from the Australian Food & Grocery Council told Daily Mail Australia that many Australian food manufacturers seek halal certification so their products can be enjoyed by Muslims and non-Muslims. 'In the same way that food labelled as vegan or gluten-free is suitable for consumption by a broad range of consumers, halal certified foods are commonly enjoyed by non-Muslims,' he said. 'Manufacturers pay for certification as a professional service, much like Kosher or organic accreditation, for example. 'Organisations who offer Halal certification services are subject to the same prohibitions on funding illegal entities and activity as any other organisation or individual under Australian law.' Even Vegemite has come under attack for stocking halal certified products . Despite the negative complaints, many  customers have expressed their support for the range on Four'N Twenty's Facebook page: . One user posted: 'Going to have a pie party with my next pay check. What a bunch of legends!' Another one wrote: 'Good onya Four N Twenty, for ignoring the ignorant bigots. Will go out of my way to buy your products now. You're awesome' And another wrote: 'It makes sense to have your pies certified Halal, same as you would have them certified ""Kosher"" or ""Heart Foundation"" or ""Gluten Free"". Such a sensible idea. Australians need to know what they're eating. As long as your pies are still delicious, you have my support. And my custom.' Despite the negative complaints, many others are showing their support for the halal certified Aussie meat pies . One user stood up for the range, and said 'boycott and you're the ones who'll miss out on a good ol' Aussie pie' Another user wrote: 'Thank you for being a great Australian company! I love your pies...' One user wrote: 'Good on you for responding so calmly to all the bigots posting negative things...' Another user wrote: 'Just wanted to say, this Aussie family will now look specifically for your halal products'","Cadbury is the latest brand to face criticism over halal certification .

"The 27-year-old co-founder and CEO of dating app Tinder is being replaced just months after an embarrassing lawsuit revealed that he had described his boss as a penis. In July it emerged that Sean Rad had allegedly sent a text message in which he described Barry Diller, the head of IAC/InterActiveCorp, as a d*** along with a picture to illustrate. The derogatory text emerged in a lawsuit filed by former executive Whitney Wolfe, 24, who claimed she was forced from the company and sexually harassed after her relationship with co-founder and chief marketing officer Justin Mateen fell apart. Scroll down for video . Sean Rad, the 27-year-old co-founder and CEO of dating app Tinder, left, is being demoted just months after it was revealed that he had described his boss, IAC/InterActiveCorp chief Barry Diller, right, as a penis . Rad's text message was cited in her lawsuit as an example of the 'misogynist, alpha-male stereotype too often associated with technology startups'. The immature ex-CEO is alleged to have texted Wolfe a photo of a piece of paper with Diller's name written across the top, followed by the letters 'AKA'. Underneath it were Diller's initials 'BD', drawn in the shape of a penis. Rad is said to have sent the offending text during a meeting with executives from IAC, the two-year-old matchmaking app’s largest stakeholder. When news of the incident emerged in July, it was reported Rad would be safe, but the company has now decided to replace him with ‘an Eric Schmidt-like person’, reports Forbes. Rad, who is expected to remain with the company as president and board member, learned of his fate as he was preparing to take the stage at Forbes 30 Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia last month. The derogatory text emerged in a lawsuit filed by former executive Whitney Wolfe, center, who claimed she was forced from the company and sexually harassed after her relationship with co-founder and chief marketing officer Justin Mateen, left, fell apart. ‘I went through every stage of mourning at once — fear, a bruised ego,’ he told Forbes. ‘I started thinking about the company and my whole future.’ Rad announced at the event that Tinder is launching a premium service – Tinder Plus – that will allow paying users to have more match-making powers and access to premium content like a travel feature. Wolfe settled her lawsuit last month and was awarded an undisclosed amount of money, while co-founder Mateen is no longer with Tinder, or parent company IAC. In her lawsuit she accused Rad of standing by and doing nothing as she was forced out. She claims she was called a w**** by Mateen in front of Rad and was stripped of her co-founder title because Mateen told her that having a '24-year-old girl' co-founder made the company 'seem like a joke.' The lawsuit also claimed that Mateen and Rad subjected her to a 'barrage of horrendously sexist, racist and otherwise inappropriate comments, emails and text messages'. The lawsuit had also credited her with suggesting the name - 'because tinder helps to light a flame, which had obvious dating analogues'. Tinder Plus will allow paying users to have more match-making powers and access to premium content like a travel feature .","Sean Rad, the 27-year-old co-founder and CEO of dating app Tinder, has been demoted .

"Chasing a lorry down the motorway and pulling open the back doors to clamber inside, this was the scene in Calais today as yet more immigrants make frantic attempts to get into the UK. French authorities say they have been forced to send an extra 100 police to the port city as an estimated 2,500 migrants sleep rough in camps in the hope of crossing the channel. The frightened people, mostly from Africa and Asia, have been drawn to Calais in the hope of reaching 'El Dorado' Britain, thanks to generous state handouts, according to the town's mayor. Desperation: A group of migrants rip open the back doors of a lorry in Calais today as they try to find a way to cross from France into Britain in search of a better life . Wave of humanity: There are thought to be around 2,500 people currently camping in the French port city, as authorities send another 100 officers to deal with the crisis . Dying for a better life: Yesterday the mayor of Calais warned that migrants were willing to die in order to get to Britain, and blamed generous government handouts for drawing them in . Natacha Bouchart yesterday told the Commons home affairs select committee that the UK's welfare system is to blame for the crisis, which has seen record numbers of migrants arrive this year. The offer of £35 per week for those arriving on these shores is prompting people to risk their lives to cross the channel. She said: ‘The real magnet is not the city of Calais but the benefits that are perceived in Great Britain. ‘The weekly benefits of £36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives. ‘They have no idea about the value of money … But they know from those people who have got through [to Britain] that … they can easily find work, don’t have to declare their work, they can find accommodation and can get some money every week. Fleeing: The men are mostly African or Asian and are fleeing humanitarian problems back home, including war, famine and persecution . Lost: Yesterday it was revealed that the British government has lost track of 50,000 illegal migrant, while it has failed to deport another 175,000 . Under attack: Just last month a P&O ferry crew were forced to use a fire hose on 250 immigrants as they tried to rush on board the boat (pictured, a migrant tried to break into a lorry in Calais today) 'People who have got through call and say,… ""this is El Dorado and we’re staying here"".’ Once here, there is also the chance that they could become one of the 50,000 illegal immigrants that the Public Accounts Committee admits it has lost track of. It was revealed today that ministers have failed to kick out another 175,000 immigrants, at a time when applications to enter the country have grown by an alarming 70 per cent in a year. It is perhaps no surprise, then, to find thousands of desperate people living in squalid camps in France, and leaping into lorries in an attempt to come here. These images show groups of ten or more forcing open the back of lorries destined for Dover before virtually tripping over each-other in order to pile in. Setting up camp: The French government has announced plans for a shelter for the migrants who are currently sleeping in tents, saying that the conditions have lead to infighting . No other choice: While many fear that the new shelter will simply attract more desperate people, France says it is the UK benefits system that has drawn so many in the first place . Taking shelter: A migrant hoping to find a way into Britain from Calais sits underneath a makeshift awning in one of the camps that now surround Calais . The issue of immigration has shot up the political agenda in Britain ever since Douglas Carswell become the first UKIP MP after winning a by-election in Clacton by a huge margin. A ComRes survey revealed last week that Mark Reckless  is on course to become Nigel Farage's second MP in a by-election in Rochester next month, as voters punish both the Tories and Labour over immigration and the EU. Ed MIliband and David Cameron exchanged blows over the issue during Prime Minister's Questions in Parliament today, with Miliband attacking the Prime Minister - saying his government had missed key migration targets. Natacha Bouchart says Britain must own up to its part in causing the current crisis in Calais, and called on David Cameron to prove that the UK is not an 'El Dorado' for migrants . Cameron hit back, saying he would compared his record to Labour's 'any time', suggesting that the last government had created the mess he was trying to fix. Only last month staff on a P&O ferry were forced to use a fire hose on around 250 Eritrean men after they scaled barriers around the port and tried to storm on to the boat. The lorry driver who filmed the scene described the city as being like a 'war zone', saying the problem was the worst he had seen it in 20 years.","Groups of migrants pictured breaking into lorries in Calais, France, today .

"A Mexican restaurant owner says he won't change the name of his establishment some community members find offensive to illegal immigrants. The restaurant in Denver, Colorado has been named Illegal Pete's for many years and owner Pete Turner says the name wasn't meant to offend and was named after his rambunctious father with whom he shared a name. Turner wrote a blog post on the restaurant's website saying that he 'appreciates' the community's concern but says that they vastly misunderstood the meaning of his restaurant's name and what it stands for. Illegal Pete: Pete Turner said he never meant to offend illegal immigrants and that the restaurant is named after his father and after a bar in a novel he read as an English major at the University of Boulder . 'When it came to the name Illegal Pete’s, I settled on the name of a bar in a novel. The name resonated with me for the obvious reason that my name is Pete, but of equal importance, it was my father’s name.' Pete wrote on the restaurant's website that when he was opening the restaurant, his father was battling cancer. 'My father, who helped me secure the financing for the restaurant, was terminally ill with cancer, having battled stage 4 Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma since 1989. He was never able to work in the restaurant, but he was my moral support during the months leading up to opening and the two years of operation up to his death in August 1997. Needless to say, he was a fighter, and I liked that he and I could share the ins and outs of this business,' writes Pete. The restaurant’s mission statement is, 'To create an atmosphere that celebrates individuality and relaxed human connection.' Fort Collins: Nearly 50 Fort Collins residents gathered at a meeting last month to demand that Turner change the name of the restaurant, just weeks before the new location's opening . Pete said he has chosen to brand the restaurant in several different ways but said none of those branding had an emphasis on illegal immigrants, reports Fox. Last month, Colorado residents urged Pete to change the name of his business due to its 'social context.' Pete Turner listened to a concerned crowd in Fort Collins in October as they urged him to change the name of his business, saying it was offensive to immigrants, according to the Coloradoan. CBS Denver reports that nearly 50 people attended the meeting including community members and Colorado State University students and faculty. Turner reportedly told the crowd that the name is a literary reference to a bar in a novel he read as an English major in Boulder. Turner also told the crowd that he has helped pay for some of his employees to become citizens. But crowd member, Lucy Gonzales, 25, told Pete to drop the 'illegal' -- or 'I-word' -- in the name and many likened the term to racial slurs toward African-Americans. Reference: Turner said that the restaurant's name is a literary reference to a book he read in college and never intended to offend anyone and it's also named after his father . Kim Medina, Fort Collins immigration attorney and meeting moderator, said the issue was one of a social nature. 'Social context is hugely important,' Medina said at the meeting. 'We'll never get to big issues, such as immigration reform, until we can solve these smaller issues of language.' The meeting comes almost three weeks before Turner is scheduled to open a new 'Illegal Pete's' in the town, according to the Coloradoan. Turner's attendance at the meeting was prompted by a letter written to him from Antero Garcia, Colorado State University assistant English professor, the Coloradoan reports. In the letter, Garcia wrote: 'The restaurant will be located in the same area that current Fort Collins residents remember often seeing signs saying 'No dogs or Mexicans.' It is under this legacy of American racist practices that the name 'Illegal Pete's' becomes unacceptable.' And at the meeting, Garcia said that Turner's restaurant would instil violence in the community. After many shared personal experiences about growing up in Fort Collins during times of harsh racial discrimination, Turner said he couldn't imagine living that way, CBS reports. Though he could empathize with the group, Turner said he did not realize the issue was one regarding free speech and said he believes he has a right to name his business whatever he chooses. Cheryl Distaso, coordinator of the social justice non-profit Fort Collins Community Action Network, said that the restaurant's name is dehumanizing and she is confident that Turner will 'do the right thing.'","The restaurant in Denver, Colorado has been named Illegal Pete's for years and owner Pete Turner says the name wasn't meant to offend .
Pete wrote on the restaurant's website that when he was opening the restaurant, his father, also named Pete, was battling cancer .
Last month, Colorado residents urged Pete to change the name of his business due to its 'social context' but he says he won't budge ."
"After coming under fire for her ‘wooden’ performance on last week’s Strictly Come Dancing, Judy Murray has been desperately trying to shake things up. But judging by these rehearsal pictures, she has some way to go yet. The mother of tennis star Andy still looked rather rigid as she practised with dance partner Anton du Beke ahead of tonight’s show, managing an awkward grin as she moved through a tense routine. Scroll down for video . Long way to go: The mother of tennis star Andy still looked rather rigid as she practised with dance partner Anton du Beke ahead of tonight’s show . A show insider conceded Mrs Murray is ‘still a bit wooden’, but insisted she has improved, saying: ‘She used to be as stiff as an old oak tree. Now she’s more like a bendy Scots pine.’ Fortunately for Judy, however, Strictly is a game of doubles – and the popularity of du Beke, 48, could be enough to save her. Despite Mrs Murray’s struggles on the dancefloor, show judge Len Goodman backed the 55-year-old to progress in the competition with the help of du Beke’s fans. The 70-year-old told ITV’s Loose Women: ‘People love Anton, and I understand why. He’s such a nice guy. So if they are not going to vote for his partner, they will think oh, I’ll vote for him.’ Others have suggested Mrs Murray could benefit from a partisan block of Scottish voters. Last week she escaped elimination despite being handed the lowest score of the night – 17 points out of 40. At the time, Craig Revel Horwood sniped that her body was as ‘tight as a newly-strung racket, very stiff and tense’. Escaped: Despite being handed the lowest score of the night - 17 points out of 40 - she avoided the chop when MasterChef host Gregg Wallace was put in the bottom two by public vote before losing the dance-off . But she avoided the chop when MasterChef host Gregg Wallace was put in the bottom two by the public vote and lost the dance-off to Mrs Brown’s Boys actress Jennifer Gibney. A show insider said Mrs Murray is not expected to find herself in a dance-off any time soon thanks to the ‘Anton effect’, adding: ‘He is so popular with the viewers. They love him.’ While he has never won the show, du Beke famously made it to the quarter-final in 2010 with former MP Ann Widdecombe, 67, despite scoring consistently low marks throughout the series. Tonight, he and Mrs Murray will be hoping to impress American singer Donny Osmond, who is appearing as a guest judge. He will also sing in tomorrow’s episode.

"The doctor behind the controversial procedure which lightened reality TV star Tameka 'Tiny' Harris's eye color has described the procedure as 'completely safe.' Dr. Menif Montasser  performed the surgery on the reality star at a clinic in Tunisia, Africa and said it was done under a local anesthetic with no 'pain or redness.' He told Jezebel: 'This surgery is done under local or general anesthesia with three incisions, one is 2 millimeters and the other two are 0.8 millimeters in the eye's peripheral.' Scroll down for video . Happy with the results: 'I looked in the mirror and I was, like, 'they're amazing,' the 39-year-old said . Transformation: Tameka 'Tiny' Harris, wife of rapper T.I., appeared on Good Morning America on Thursday to discuss the cosmetic eye implant she received in Africa to change her eye colour from brown to ice grey . 'The implant is folded in to an injector, then it's injected in the eye after filling the eye with viscoelastic.' He described how this type of procedure only takes about five to ten minutes per eye, and can allow a patient to be out of the operating room and back at the hotel in four hours. Montasser said: 'The next day she [Tiny] woke up with new ice grey eyes and no pain or redness.' 'She enjoyed her time in Tunisia for the rest of week.' Montasser said the surgery, which is illegal in America, is perfectly safe but patients must follow strict instructions during the two to three month recovery period. This type of cosmetic implant  first surfaced about five years ago and has been done in the Middle East, Panama and Africa. The implants are permanent unless a patient really needs them out, in which case a doctor can remove the implants with the same incision of 2 millimeters. Montasser explained: 'The implant was created by doctors and biomedical engineers of BrightOcular but the original artificial iris implant invention goes back from over two decades ago.' 'It's solely used for aniridia cases, which are currently used in the U.S. Europe, and Asia.'

However, the wife of rapper T.I., was forced to defend her decision to permanently lighten the colour of her eyes after she received a backlash from fans on social media sites like Twitter and Instagram. Harris, who co-wrote TLC's massive hit No Scrubs, said she went to Africa for her procedure and felt  fine afterwards. 'I looked in the mirror and I was, like, 'they're amazing,' she said on Good Morning America on Thursday. She added: 'They told me that the procedure was going to be quick, five to 10 minutes an eye. They woke me up. It was very blurry, then it kind of fades in.' She later took to Instagram on Monday to show off her new eye colour accompanied by a gushing caption. 'Huge thanks to the incredible doctor(s) for the amazing experience and for making my dream come true! I hated wearing contacts just for the color and it made my vision blurry!'  Harris wrote. 'Blessed to say my vision is #perfect after my #ice-gray implants! Special thanks to the #Brightocular staff for ALL that you've done to make this process happen, you're amaZing & thank you to the hospital's staff for your exceptional customer service as well‼️' She added: 'Of course any procedure has potential risks but no one has gone blind with brightocular and the success rate has been close to 100%.'","Dr. Menif Montasser performed the surgery on Tameka 'Tiny' Harris'

"It pushed the boundaries of typical teen TV earlier this year, revolving around two high school best friends that pretend to be lesbians in order to become popular. Now MTV's quirky rom com series Faking It is continuing to break ground by introducing an intersex character in its second season. Premiering Tuesday night to 1.04 million viewers, the show revealed that regular character Lauren - stepsister of protagonist Amy - has both male and female chromosomes. Played by actress Bailey De Young, Lauren was born genetically male, but her body naturally developed as female, according to CNN. Scroll down for video .

Amy and best friend Karma (left - played by Katie Stevens), pretended to be lesbians during the show's first season, only for Amy to actually fall for Karma . About one in every 2,000 people are born with intersex traits. Generally their reproductive anatomy does not fit the definition of male or female, such as a female born with an enlarged clitorus or without a vaginal opening, according to the Intersex Societ of North America. Source: Intersex Society of North America . Some males are born with a small penis and a scrotum that has formed more like a labia. 'Part of the overall theme of 'Faking It' is how hard it is to be your authentic self and how important it is to strive to do that,' show developer Carter Covington told The Hollywood Reporter. 'For Lauren, being born intersex is going to be something she's going to struggle to accept and then struggle to defend in her life.' Covington said he had prepared for a fight with MTV over the plot. However the network embraced the idea. 'People want to create TV that touches people and that shows a different subset,' he said. 'I'm always excited as a writer when there is an experience I can relate to, and MTV wanted programming that touches people and moves people.' In the episode, the character of Lauren can be seen turning to an online support group after her friends are made aware that she was born intersex. Actress Bailey De Young was excited and interested in playing someone born intersex, who are typically genetically male but with signs of female and male sexual development . Convington said the consultant the show worked with to better understand people born intersex was a member of Inter/Act, the first intersex youth advocacy organization. 'We're trying to give people tools to build and connect with that community,' he told The Hollywood Reporter. 'People born with these conditions are often told they will never meet anyone else like them, and they all found that not to be true. ' Faking It is set in Austin, Texas. It's theme center around empowering outcasts and breaking convention.

"A father has attacked a court's decision to fine him more than £400 for taking his daughter out of school to go to her grandmother's funeral - despite the fact she missed 40 days of term-time. Ikram Hussain, 51, took his daughter Imaan out of Paddock Junior Infant and Nursery School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, to attend his 86-year-old mother Gulab Bi's funeral in Pakistan. However, he was hauled before magistrates after his daughter, who was aged five at the time, failed to return to classes for more than a month. Ikram Hussain, 51, took his daughter Imaan (pictured) out of Paddock Junior Infant and Nursery School in Huddersfield, to attend his 86-year-old mother Gulab Bi's funeral in Pakistan and kept her off school for 40 days . Mr Hussain's mother died on March 3 and he said he joined his wife Humaira, 31, the following day in attending the school to inform them of their plans to attend the funeral abroad. However, the taxi driver said the couple were told they would be fined if they proceeded as intended because they wanted their daughter, who is now six, to have a lengthy period off school because the funeral service included 40 days of prayer. The father of four said it is part of Muslim tradition to take 40 days of mourning following a relatives death. He said he travelled to the country, with his wife and daughter, to bury his mother's body immediately after her death and stayed for a further 40 days while the community helped the family mourn. He said that, as part of the tradition, friends and family members would visit the family during the 40-day period before they all attended a service on the last day to say the final prayers to the deceased. He is now angry at a court's decision to fine him after he took his daughter out of school on March 4 and didn't send her back to classes until April 9. Mr Hussain was fined more than £400 after taking his daughter out of Paddock Junior Infant and Nursery School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire (pictured) on March 4 and not sending her back to classes until April 9 . Last week, Mr Hussain appeared alongside his wife at Kirklees Magistrates' Court and pleaded guilty to the offence. The couple were fined £416 including court costs after an original fine for keeping their daughter out of school was increased due to non-payment. Under new measures brought in last year, parents can now be fined for taking their children out of school during term-time. Previously, head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year. However, under new measures brought in by former Education Secretary Michael Gove, children can only be taken out of school in 'exceptional circumstances'. Parents who take their children out of school without authorisation, can face a fine of up to £60 for every child. Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, fined £2,500 and even face jail. Mr Hussain, of Paddock, Huddersfield, disputes the court's decision and said he wanted the court case to go to trial because he wanted a jury to 'hear what he had to say'. He said: 'At the time I was not really bothered but I am annoyed about it now. It's not as if it was a pleasant trip for us to make. 'I had no other choice but to take my daughter with me to do the burial.  It’s something we had to do. 'The magistrates were not interested in what I had to say. I wanted a jury to hear what I had to say but it seems that's not possible.' Gill Ellis, assistant director for learning and skills at the school, said: 'The law makes it clear that head teachers can only grant leave of absence during term time for exceptional reasons. 'It is at the discretion of the head teacher to decide what is exceptional and how many days a child can be away from school if leave is granted. 'If a parent decides to take the child out of school without the head teacher's permission then they will have 21 days from the day the fine is issued before it doubles. 'If after 28 days the fine remains unpaid then the council will normally proceed with prosecution. Mr Hussain, 51, who appeared alongside his wife Humaira, 31, at Kirklees Magistrates' Court (pictured) was fined £416 after an original fine for keeping his daughter out of school was increased due to non-payment . 'The court then determines whether the parents are guilty of an offence. Parents are advised of the process when they make the initial leave request. 'We are committed to providing the best start in life for our young people, in schools. 'Therefore, every lesson of every day is important and absence from school can be very damaging to a child's education. 'We have an excellent record in Kirklees of reducing absence from school and overwhelmingly it is the case that parents are very supportive of the measures taken locally to promote attendance at school.' The mother of a seven-year-old girl recovering from cancer faced a fine and potential prison sentence in August after allowing her daughter to skip seven days of school. Kerry Capper, 25, said she let her daughter have the odd day off to ‘keep an eye on her’ when she was feeling ill – fearing the disease had returned. In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy. Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children’s Hospital for regular check-ups and between January and March this year Miss Capper kept her at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham. Kerry Capper, 25, (left) was hauled before a court after letting her seven-year-old daughter Libby (right), who is recovering from cancer, have the odd day off school to ‘keep an eye on her’ when she was feeling ill . However, the mother was summoned to appear before magistrates for failing to pay a £60 penalty fine for the ‘unauthorised absence’. Ms Capper, from Birmingham, had been summoned to appear before magistrates last month for failing to pay the £60 penalty fine, which was later increased to £120. Birmingham Council said no reason was given for the time off and that Ms Capper had failed to attend meetings arranged by the school to discuss the situation. However, the unemployed mother was cleared by the bench who said that while magistrates felt Ms Capper was in breach of the school's truancy policy processes she was 'not necessarily in breach of the law'. Earlier this year, parents Andrew and Danielle Overend-Hogg were sent a threatening letter warning them about their three children missing class after they took them off school for a week for their grandfather's funeral. Parents Andrew and Danielle Overend-Hogg were sent a threatening letter after they took their three children (pictured together above) out of school for a week to attend a funeral service in Cumbria earlier this year . The children, Teagan, nine, Isla, five and Elsie-Mae, three, travelled with their parents and eight-month-old brother Noah from their home in Sheffield to Cumbria for the funeral service. The Catholic funeral service stretched over two days, meaning the three youngsters missed a week of school. Mr and Mrs Overend-Hogg said they were 'disgusted' by the letter that awaited their return. Officials in Ballifield Primary School in Sheffield said the absence was 'unsanctioned' and as a result could  jeopardise the children's place in the school. And in May, Gaynor Hodge, 39, and her husband Leigh, 41, were warned they could face a £1,000 fine if they took their ten-year-old daughter out of school for her grandfather’s funeral. Hanbury’s Farm Primary School, Tamworth, told the couple the reason did not amount to ‘exceptional circumstances’.","Ikram Hussain angry at court decision to fine him over £400 for absence .

"Nearly everyone agrees that texting and driving is dangerous. Most people do it anyway. In a new survey, 98per cent of motorists who own cellphones and text regularly said they were aware of the dangers, yet three-quarters of them admitted to texting while driving, despite laws against it in some states. Two-thirds said they have read text messages while stopped at a red light or stop sign, while more than a quarter said they have sent texts while driving. More than a quarter of the texting drivers believed they 'can easily do several things at once, even while driving.' Eyes off the road: In a new survey, 98per cent of motorists who own cellphones and text regularly were aware of the dangers, yet three-quarters of them admit to texting while driving . The telephone survey of 1,004 U.S. adults was released Wednesday by AT&T Inc. as part of an anti-texting-and-driving campaign. AT&T designed the survey with David Greenfield, founder of The Center for Internet and Technology Addiction and a professor at the University of Connecticut's School of Medicine. The survey came as AT&T expanded availability of a free app that silences text message alerts and activates automatically when a person is moving 15 miles per hour or faster. (Passengers can turn it off.) The DriveMode app is coming to iPhones after being previously available on Android and BlackBerry phones for AT&T users only. The iPhone version will be available to customers of competing carriers as well, but some functions will work only on AT&T devices. The study in May was of cellphone owners ages 16 to 65 who drive almost every day and text at least once a day. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Researchers conducted surveys with people on their cellphones, and it's possible those who would have picked up on a landline might have different attitudes. Greenfield said the survey is the latest to show a discrepancy between people's attitudes and behaviors. It found a broad range of reasons why drivers text. Forty-three percent of the texting drivers said they want to 'stay connected' to friends, family and work. Nearly a third did it out of habit. Lesson learned: Reggie Shaw was 19 in 2006 when he caused a car accident while texting, killing two people . Among other reasons for texting and driving: . Reggie Shaw was 19 in 2006 when he caused a car accident while texting, killing two people. Today, he speaks out against texting and driving. 'It's something I struggle with every day,' he said. 'I know that I need to go out and talk to others about it. I don't want others to make the same mistake I did.' Shaw does not remember what he was texting about right before the accident. Back then, he said, 'being on my phone when I drove was something I did all the time. It was just driving to me. I guess you'd call it ignorance but I never understood that it was dangerous. How could me being on the phone cause a car accident?' Today, his phone is off when he's driving. Never in the past eight years since the accident, he says, has he gotten a phone call or text message that was so important that it couldn't wait until he stopped the car. Greenfield, who studies the effects of digital technology on the brain, likes to call smartphones 'the world's smallest slot machines' because they affect the brain in similar ways that gambling or drugs can. Dopamine levels increase as you anticipate messages, and that leads to higher levels of pleasure. Getting desirable messages can increase dopamine levels further. While all distractions can be dangerous, much of the focus has been on texting and driving, Greenfield said, because 'it's ongoing and because there is an anticipatory aspect to it.' Greenfield said people should not use their phone at all while driving, but acknowledges that this might not be realistic. Apps, public education and laws that ban texting and driving, he said, will all help change people's behavior, just as anti-drunken-driving laws and public education campaigns have reduced drunken driving over the past few decades.","In a new survey by AT&T Inc. 98per cent of motorists who own cellphones and text regularly said they were aware of the dangers .

"It can restore a sense of touch to those missing limbs - and could revolutionise prosthetics. Researchers have revealed two patients fitted with radical new artificial limbs that interface directly with their skeleton and nervous system. They were able to identify objects that touched their skin, and do everything from chop wood to drive trucks. Scroll down for video . Keith Vonderhueval, a Swedish truck driver, was one of the first  to receive the technology, which interfaces directly to his skeleton and nerves. One, a man who lost his right hand in an industrial accident four years ago can feel objects again thanks to a bionic hand with a sense of touch. Wearing a blindfold Igor Spetic, 48, was aware of arm hairs rising when a researcher brushed the back of his artificial device with a cotton ball. He said: 'I knew immediately it was cotton.' Nerves that used to relay the sense of touch to the brain are stimulated by contact points on seven millimetre 'electrode cuffs' that encircle major nerve bundles in the arm. Once the cuffs have been connected to the right nerves Spetic can feel the back of his hand and fingers being touched when the corresponding locations on the prosthetic come into contact with things ranging from rough sandpaper to smooth metal. The system - which is limited to the lab at this stage - has worked for two-and-a-half years in Spetic's case and 18 months for a second patient in the trial Keith Vonderhueval. Similar research involving prosthetic hands has reported sensation lasting one month and - in some cases - the ability to feel began to fade over weeks. Because of Vonderheuval's and Spetic's continuing progress researchers are hopeful the method can lead to a lifetime of use and optimistic a system can be developed for use at home within five years. Spetic has a physically challenging job as a truck driver in northern Sweden, and since the surgery he has experienced that he can cope with all the situations he faces - everything from clamping his trailer load and operating machinery, to unpacking eggs and tying his children's skates, regardless of the environmental conditions. Patient wearing a prosthetic limb directly attached to the skeleton and neuromuscular system. What's more Spetic's phantom pain - which he described as a vice crushing his closed fist since the hand was sliced off by a forging hammer while making an aluminium jet part - subsided almost completely. Vonderhueval - who had less phantom pain after losing his right hand and much of his forearm in an accident - said his is also almost gone. Both men said the first time they were connected to the system and received the electrical stimulation was the first time they'd felt their hands since their accidents. In the ensuing months they began feeling familiar sensations and were able to control their prosthetic hands with more dexterity. Igor Spetic Holding a Cherry Tomato . Professor Dustin Tyler, of Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, said: 'The sense of touch is one of the ways we interact with objects around us. 'Our goal is not just to restore function but to build a reconnection to the world. This is long-lasting, chronic restoration of sensation over multiple points across the hand.' 'The work reactivates areas of the brain that produce the sense of touch. When the hand is lost the inputs that switched on these areas were lost.' Surgeons implanted three electrodes in Spetic's forearm - enabling him to feel 19 distinct points - and two in Vonderhuevel's upper arm enabling him to feel 16. The direct skeletal attachment is created by what is known as osseointegration - a technology in limb prostheses pioneered by associate professor Rickard Branemark and his colleagues at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden. The artificial arm is directly attached to the skeleton, thus providing mechanical stability. Then the human's biological control system, that is nerves and muscles, is also interfaced to the machine's control system via neuromuscular electrodes. This creates an intimate union between the body and the machine; between biology and mechatronics. The patient's arm was amputated over 10 years ago. Before the surgery, his prosthesis was controlled via electrodes placed over the skin. Vonderhueval - who lost his hand in 2OO5 - said: 'The sense of touch actually gets better. 'They change things on the computer to change the sensation. One time it felt like water running across the back of my hand.' When they began the study published online by the journal Science Translational Medicine the sensation Spetic felt when a sensor was touched was a tingle. To provide more natural sensations the researchers have developed algorithms that convert the input from the sensors taped to a patient's hand into varying patterns and intensities of electrical signals. The sensors themselves aren't sophisticated enough to discern textures - they detect only pressure. The different signal patterns - passed through the electrodes - are read as different stimuli by the brain. The patterns are still being fine-tuned and Spetic and Vonderhuevel who both live in Ohio appear to be becoming more attuned to them. A blindfolded Vonderhuevel has held grapes or cherries in his prosthetic hand - the signals enabling him to gauge how tightly he's squeezing - and pulled out the stems. He said: 'When the sensation's on it's not too hard. When it's off you make a lot of grape juice.' Prof Tyler believes everyone creates a map of sensations from their life history enabling them to correlate an input to a given sensation. He said: 'I don't presume the stimuli we're giving is hitting the spots on the map exactly but they're familiar enough the brain identifies what it is.' In addition to hand prosthetics Prof Tyler believes the technology can be used to help those using prosthetic legs receive input from the ground and adjust to gravel or uneven surfaces. Beyond that the neural interfacing and new stimulation techniques may be useful in controlling tremors, deep brain stimulation and more.","Igor Spetic, 48, first to be fitted with radical prosthetic .

"Is it a boat or is it a plane? Well, it's both, and a sensational way to see the northern coast of Corsica. This 'flying boat', as it's known, operates out of Saint-Florent and is somewhere between a seaplane, a paraglider and a hang glider. Starting on flat ocean water the boat is only a boat for moments, as it picks up speed and takes to the sky courtesy of its hang glider wing. From that point it can cruise in the air to wherever the passenger desires, whether it be a joy ride around the beautiful beaches of the area such as Saleccia and Lotu or a return trip to the towns of Nonza to the north or L'Ile-Rousse to the west. Not just reliant on the breeze, a 70 horsepower engine also helps the pilot stay in control. While the gentle noise of the engine interrupts the serenity somewhat, the freedom it offers makes the many pleasure boats that charter the waters here look positively ill-equipped. Unsurprisingly, it's not exactly a cheap exercise, with a 30-minute return journey to Nonza Cap Corse setting visitors back 120 Euro (£74) or a flight to somewhere such as L'Ile-Rousse costing 200 Euro (£124) per hour.

Officers have been drafted in from Poland (left) and Lithuania (right) to help British police tackle foreign criminals . This week's nationwide traffic operation - codenamed Operation Trivium - is being coordinated by West Midlands Police. Police who stop any vehicles registered in one of the eight countries will be able to immediately discover if the driver or passengers are wanted. It is thought there are about 350,000 foreign-registered cars on British roads at any one time, and about 3000 of those are suspected to be linked to crime. West Midlands Police Superintendent Paul Keasey, said: 'Foreign nationals who commit crime in the UK, and who use the road network to facilitate that criminality, may feel untouchable by UK police forces - but operations like this demonstrate our commitment to cross-border policing and that borders are no barrier to justice. 'I'm delighted to welcome colleagues from police forces in Europe. They will join us on operations and their support is invaluable: they will have instant access to intel systems at home and be able to question drivers in their mother tongue, assess their demeanour and attitude, and better detect if they are co-operating with officers. 'In the past we've arrested people for crimes ranging from motoring offences to human trafficking, money laundering, GBH and fraud, as well as motoring offences like driving with no insurance or licence.' Police who stop any vehicles registered in one of the eight countries will be able to immediately discover if the driver or passengers are wanted . Officers drafted in to Britain include Lithuanian traffic cop Marija Kazanovic, 34 (left) and Ruta Cornel, 23 of the Romanian force . Marija Kazanovic is able to tap into Lithuania's police records to make sure fake details are not handed over . A Czech national wanted for 23 offences and a Slovakian man suspected of running a human trafficking ring were among the arrests on Day One of Operation Trivium − a operation targeting foreign criminals in the UK. West Midlands Police officers − accompanied by Lonut Preda from Romania's Traffic Division − spotted the 28-year-old Czech man in Birmingham city centre travelling in a car linked to vehicle insurance fraud. Checks made at the Operation Trivium control centre in Edgbaston − where European intelligence officers have direct access to police systems at home − showed he was wanted on a European Arrest Warrant for offences including burglary and robbery. He will now be transported to Westminster Magistrates Court and faces deportation to the Czech Republic to face the charges. And another man wanted on a European Arrest Warrant − a 34-year-old Slovak suspected of being involved in trafficking people to the UK − was arrested after being found hiding at an address in Handsworth's Headingly Road. Superintendent Keasey, said: 'The Operation brings together police forces across Europe, plus Europol, to share information on criminals and emerging crime trends. 'It's been a hugely successful start to the Operation and the overseas officers have proved invaluable when we've encountered foreign nationals on roads patrols − and they will also be involved in several planned raids.' Artur Zawadzki, 39, of Poland, will help overcome language barriers with overseas drivers . Foreign police officers in the UK have joined forces with European coppers in a bid to tackle crime in the UK . All 43 police forces across the UK are taking part in Operation Trivium and running checks on people and vehicles through the control centre in Birmingham. In the first 24 hours, a total of 875 cars have been stopped nationally, 109 seized and 55 people arrested. A further 517 were handed on-the-spot fines for minor traffic offences, cautioned or summonsed to court. Arrests of foreign nationals were made yesterday in Cornwall, Hertfordshire, Surrey, Essex and Merseyside for offences including burglary, robbery, fraud and drugs trafficking. And already this morning several foreign-plated vehicles have been seized for motoring offences, including a minibus at Junction 3 of the M5 that was found running on 'red' diesel. Immigration checks are being carried out against the 13 passengers on board. Supt Keasey, added: 'It's important to stress we're targeting criminals, not the communities these offenders hail from. Many people settle in the UK from Eastern Europe, make efforts to integrate, work and make a positive contribution to society. 'But it's those who try using borders to cover their criminal tracks that Operation Trivium targets through an international show of strength.'","Police from eight European countries  are spending a week in the UK .

"Punk legend Chrissie Hynde has supported a campaign to ban horse-drawn carriages from New York City and replace them with $450,000 'vintage' eCarriages. The Pretenders singer arrived in one of the electrically-powered carriages outside the Beacon Theatre on Broadway before a recent show. The singer is backing a plan by animal rights charity NYCLASS, who want to remove all the horses from the city streets. Singer Chrissie Hynde, centre right, said she wants all horse-drawn carriages banned from Central Park . Hynde wants the horses replaced by these new horseless battery-powered  'eCarriages' The singer was escorted to a theatre on Broadway in one of the electric carriages by two men wearing rubber horse's heads . New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he wants horse drawn carriages - clip-clopping rides through Central Park are a famous tourist attraction - gone from city streets because they are cruel to the animals. While he initially promised to get rid of the carriages within a week of taking office at the start of the year, he now expects a ruling on their future by the end of the year. According to CBS New York, Hynde said: 'If you want an historic trip through the city of New York, and a romantic trip through Central Park, we suggest you use of these instead of the carriage horses — and we hope we see the end of them very soon.' She arrived outside the theatre accompanied by two men wearing horse masks. The charity is planning to lobby City Hall on November 13 for an immediate ban. However, Schindler's List star Liam Neeson has opposed idea, claiming the horses involved are well cared for. Writing in the New York Times, he said: 'I have been a New York City resident for over 20 years, and have enjoyed Central Park for as long. As a horse lover, I grew up riding and caring for two horses every summer on my aunt’s small farm in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. I have continued to enjoy working with horses in a professional context over the years, appearing in a couple of Westerns and what I call “cowboys in armor” movies. Hynde, pictured, used the eCarriage to travel to the Beacon Theatre on Broadway where she was appearing . The $450,000 eCarriage can carry a maximum of eight passengers and features a vintage design . 'I can appreciate a happy and well-cared-for horse when I see one. It has been my experience, always, that horses, much like humans, are at their happiest and healthiest when working. Horses have been pulling from the beginning of time. It is what they have been bred to do.' NYCLASS said they have people who are willing and able to adopt every horse currently used in the carriage trade, and not one would be sent to the slaughter. They claim the new eCarriages would provide work for the drivers. The prototype horseless eCarriage cost $450,000 and has a top speed of 30mph and a range of 100 miles. It is powered by a lithium ion battery, which would take six hours to recharge. The eCarriage debuted at the NYC Auto show in April.","Singer Chrissie Hynde backs the campaign to ban horse drawn carriages .

"Rona Fairhead could yet save BBC Three from going entirely digital - but probably won't . THE BBC’s new chairman has backed a controversial plan to move its youth channel online, saying the idea is ‘in and of itself good’. Despite mounting opposition from presenters and some executives, Rona Fairhead said the corporation should focus on putting even more shows on the internet. As head of the BBC Trust, Miss Fairhead has the power to block the plan to axe BBC Three, which was announced by director general Tony Hall in March. However, she hinted it is likely to be rubber stamped and said the BBC should do even more to cater for young viewers who prefer to watch television on their tablets and mobile phones. As well as dismaying those who want to save BBC Three, Miss Fairhead’s comments will heap further pressure on the BBC to close a loophole which allows viewers to watch catch-up TV online for free. More than 450,000 people avoid paying the £145.50 licence fee every year while continuing to watch BBC shows, in many cases because they access its programmes on iPlayer. The most recent figures show that viewers aged between 16 and 24 spend just half their time watching shows as they are broadcast. More than 450,000 people avoid paying the £145.50 licence fee every year while continuing to watch BBC shows, in many cases because they access its programmes on iPlayer (above) Miss Fairhead told the culture, media and sport committee: ‘The statistics show that this group are watching less. They are certainly watching very differently. ‘Although sometimes they watch by appointment - either Strictly [Come Dancing] or a sports occasion - typically they watch on-the-go through the devices they have. ‘The idea of moving BBC Three and making it on-line of itself is good.’ Miss Fairhead has been in her post for just two weeks, having been selected as the successor to Chris Patten after he stepped down for health reasons in May. During yesterday’s Commons hearing, she was criticised by Tory MP Philip Davies for heaping praise on the BBC when she is supposed to stand up for the licence fee payers. He said: ‘You started from a point of thinking how wonderful it was, and what has struck you is how even more wonderful it was than you thought it was when you first started. Have you gone native in record time?’ BBC Three has more viewers aged between 16 and 34 than any otehr youth television station including E4, Sky 1 and ITV2. Shows such as Bad Education and Being Human attract  29 per cent of this age group on a weekly basis. Little Britain starring Matt Lucas and David Walliams (above as rubbish transvestites Florence and Emily) Since it was set up in 2003, the channel has launched shows such as Little Britain starring Matt Lucas and David Walliams and Gavin & Stacey starring James Corden. It has won four Bafta Awards and was named non-terrestrial channel of the year three times at the Edinburgh TV Festival. The channel is on air between 7pm and 4am every night. It has an audience of around a million viewers. However, Miss Fairhead insisted she would criticise the BBC where needed, and said she would encourage it to focus on putting more programmes on the Internet. She said: ‘I think challenging the BBC executive and production teams to think about what works well online, because it is a different genre, is important. ‘In the charter review, what I would expect is we would get the feedback from the younger audience and that will feed into what we think we need do as a universal broadcaster. ‘We are there to address the needs and wants of all licence-fee payers. 'It will require more focus online. More focus on understanding on how these viewers watch, and even catch up television. ‘Catch up television appears to be a way the younger audience will use the BBC and view programmes.’ Miss Fairhead’s comments come amid growing concern that younger viewers are exploiting a loophole that enables them to watch BBC shows on iPlayer for free. Currently, only those who watch TV as it is broadcast – whether on traditional TV sets or online – have to pay the licence fee. In August, Lord Hall conceded that it was ‘worth considering’ whether to change the rules to force those who watch catch-up to pay. The former controller of BBC Three, Zai Bennett, recently said the plan to close the channel – which is expected to save £100million a year - was ‘perverse’, ‘odd’ and a ‘massive strategic mistake’.","Miss Fairhead said BBC should cater more for internet and tablet viewers .

"Morrisons has promised to match the low prices of Aldi and Lidl, in a first for one of the ‘big four’ supermarkets. The company aims to ‘neutralise’ the threat posed by budget rivals which have tempted millions with low prices and high quality. Earlier this year Morrisons slashed the cost of essentials such as milk and bread to match the German discount chains. Scroll down for video . Morrisons is the first of the big four supermarkets to launch a price match scheme against budget chains Aldi and Lidl . Tesco's falling market share: Big increases by rivals Aldi and Lidl have hit the retailer badly . But the Yorkshire-based supermarket is now launching a loyalty card scheme that promises to match Aldi and Lidl prices. The move is a radical response to the rise of the budget chains, which have eaten into sales at Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons. More than £3billion has been wiped off Tesco’s share value following lost sales and the accusation executives cooked the books to minimise the resulting decline in profits. This week Sainsbury’s admitted sales were down by 2.8 per cent over the past three months compared to a year ago. Morrisons boss Dalton Philips has described the change in shopping habits triggered by the cost of living squeeze and rise of discount stores as the biggest on the High Street since the 1950s. Morrisons’ Match & More loyalty card keeps a record of purchases and compares prices with those charged at Aldi, Lidl, Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s. Points are automatically added to a customer’s account at the till if their shopping would have been cheaper at a rival store. Shoppers need to spend a minimum of £15 per visit. They will receive ten points for every 1p difference in the total cost. On amassing 5,000 points they will get a £5 voucher. Mr Philips said the move was designed to ‘neutralise’ the discount chains’ price advantage. ‘The discounters have been growing strongly but they only have one thing – price,’ he said. ‘We are saying we can guarantee price, but you also get ten times the range, big brands and our butchers, bakers and cheesemongers. I am confident this is a game changer for customers.’ Previously price comparisons have proved difficult because Aldi and Lidl stock many of their own brands. Computer software is now able to compare the prices of Aldi and Lidl’s products with Morrisons’ own-label mid-range products. The supermarket insists price match schemes currently available at Sainsbury’s and Tesco are too complicated and stop short of matching prices charged by the discounters. Morrisons’ customer services director, Crawford Davidson, said: ‘Customers tell us that they like the idea of points-based supermarket cards. They like the idea of getting something back for shopping. ‘What they find frustrating is all the silly bits of paper they have to remember to get their price promise or price match. We are changing the game. We will be the first supermarket to price match Aldi and Lidl.’ Match & More launches in 11 stores today and will be rolled out across the chain by Christmas. Aldi - whose managing directors Roman Heini and Matthew Barnes are pictured - has grown in popularity among shoppers turning to budget chains .","Retailer has revealed its Match&More scheme in bid to boost sales .

"Two disabled brothers face eviction from their childhood home because the council says the property is too big for them since their parents died of cancer. Clive Samson, 50, and his 49-year-old brother Peter, lived with their mother and father in a three-bedroom council house in Betsham, near Southfleet in Kent. But they lost their father Geoffrey, a former RAF serviceman, to pancreatic cancer in December 2012 before his wife of more than 50 years, Yvonne, succumbed to breast cancer and lymphoma just months later at the age of 72. Clive Samson (left) and his brother Peter (right) say they face eviction after their parents died of cancer five months apart . The tenancy of the Samsons' semi-detached 1930s property was in Mrs Samson's name. Clive applied to Dartford Council for the lease to pass on to the next generation but has been told he and Peter must pack-up and leave the family home as they now have a spare bedroom which the council feels other tenants could fill. Clive, who has been unable to work for four years and struggles to walk because he suffers from arthritis and tendinosis, said: 'It would be devastating if we had to leave. 'The council just see two people have died and think ""we want our house back"". 'It just seems pretty callous. 'They said they would look into it and do everything they could to help us stay here - ha ha.' Peter has long suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia, and moving from the area would force him to give up the part time work he has in the village doing odd jobs for a family friend. The former mechanical engineer said: 'We are still grieving and have a whole house of our parents' things we haven't even been through yet. The brothers (pictured left as children) lost their father and mother Geoffrey and Yvonne (pictured together right) to cancer in the space of five months . 'I understand the council has a problem with not having enough properties but how does making our lives a misery help anyone?' Greenhithe and Swanscombe Royal British Legion branch treasurer Graham Mentor-Morris said: 'From a legion point of view we find it absolutely disgusting that two people of this age and disabled are likely to be ejected from the house where they have lived for all their lives. 'The fact that the family has lived there for 50 years ought to count for something.' A Dartford Council spokesman said: 'We’re not a callous council and we’re not looking to apply some rigid policy when a common-sense solution would sort things out for Peter and Clive at a difficult time for them. 'We are required to respect their privacy on some aspects of the brothers’ situation which haven’t been disclosed and which might explain what we are doing and why. 'We are far more interested in helping Peter and Clive than we are in bureaucracy and it sounds like we need to step out from behind the desk and go out to see them urgently, which we are always more than happy to do. 'Hopefully we can reassure them.'","Clive and Peter Samson lost father Geoffrey to cancer in December 2012 .

"A new report, backed by London mayor Boris Johnson, may make it easier for Australians to work and travel within the UK. The report, penned by Commonwealth Exchange's Tim Hewish, urges the British government to rethink their immigration laws when it comes to Australia and New Zealand, by creating a 'bilateral mobility zone' between the countries. The report encourages a system similar to Australia's Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement (TTTA) with New Zealand, which allows free movement between both countries. Scroll down for video . A new report, backed by London mayor Boris Johnson, may make it easier for Australians to work and travel within the UK . It also specifically mentions that New Zealanders are not eligible to receive Australian social welfare benefits when they are on the TTTA. New Zealanders are given an arrival date when they enter Australia but no termination date. allowing them to work, live and visit for an indefinite period of time. It is hoped that this scheme would dramatically restructure the current UK arrangement, which has seen a drop in Australians migrating to the UK from 40,000 in 1999 to 26,000 in 2011. The report, 'How to Solve a Problem like a Visa', has received Boris Johnson's seal of approval, who claims the 'UK needs immigration controls and an end to porous borders'. In the report, Mr Johnson recalls his trip to Australian in 2013 and how it inspired him to be an advocate for new UK visa laws. 'In 2013 I visited Australia and was reminded of the myriad enduring bonds between 'the English-speaking peoples,' 'I was also struck by the strength of the Australian economy' The report encourages a system similar to Australia's Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement (TTTA) with New Zealand, which allows free movement between both countries . 'British are more deeply contacted with Australians – culturally and emotionally – than with any other country on earth,' he said. The TTTA would be a starting point for the UK to build a fair and reasonable regime with Australia. The report quoted an unnamed Australian nurse who recently returned home after spending 2 years in London on the Tier 5 YM Visa. While she had no intentions of staying in Britain long-term before she left Australia, the nurse met somebody while she was travelling and she is now left in limbo, wondering how she can return. 'I didn't have a workplace willing to sponsor me,' she said. 'What really upsets me is the fact that I am a nurse. Anyone can see the UK is in dire need of well-trained Western nurses. 'I know because I worked alongside many European nurses that had poor English skills and whose clinical skills were borderline dangerous,' she said. An Australian teacher, who works in the UK, told the report that it is scandalous how many hoops Australian citizens have to jump through in order to stay in the UK. 'The amount of processes that Australian and New Zealand and other Commonwealth citizens have to do just to stay in the UK is absolutely ridiculous. Something needs to be done,' she said. In the report, Johnson also states that the same conditions would apply for British citizens who wanted to work and live in Australia. It is hoped that this scheme would dramatically restructure the current UK arrangement, which has seen a drop in Australians migrating to the UK from 40,000 in 1999 to 26,000 in 2011 . 'Extra Brits would never be seen as alien,' the report predicted. 'Nor would Aussies or Kiwis in Britain. The issue may come down to political climates and the resulting political will. 'The UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand share the same head of state, the same language and the same common-law legal system. 'Critically, they are all highly economically developed democracies and there is also a distinct common culture and familial bond between them. The report also touches on Australia's recent attitude towards immigration, claiming that it would morally be wrong for the Australian Government to allow Britons to work and live in Australia and refuse Asian nationals. 'This issue may come down to political climates and the resulting political will,' the report said. For instance, Australia's current attitude towards immigration has become quite turbulent in relation to Asian asylum-seekers and their branding as 'boat people'. 'It may be seen as hypocrisy for any Australian Government to on the one hand allow freedom of work and movement of Britons yet on the other refuse entry to nationals from Asian countries,' the report said. The Commonwealth has a combined population of 2.3bn people in its collection of 53 developed, developing and emerging economies . In the report, Johnson also states that the same conditions would apply for British citizens who wanted to work and live in Australia . 'At present the UK underutilises this network and the Commonwealth is undermined by an outmoded UK visa regime,' the report said. It goes on to claim that the Commonwealth countries matter to the UK because they represent the nation's past and future legacy. Yearly immigration by nationality from Old Commonwealth nations – Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa – peaked at 73,000 in 2004. This figure crashed to 29,000 in 2011. 2012 brought only slight increases in migration from Australia . In September 2013,  Boris Johnson, floated the idea of establishing bilateral labour mobility zones between the UK and Australia. In his regular Daily Telegraph column, the mayor highlighted the story of Australian school teacher Sally Roycroft,  who was forced to return to Australia after her visa expired and her school did not renew it. 'In spite of all her efforts she has been effectively kicked out of Britain,' he said. 'What is her crime? That she isn't French. Nor is she German, or Polish, or Croat, or Italian, or Greek, or Portuguese,' 'In 1973 we betrayed our relationships with Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand. 'it was assumed that in order to be internationalist it was enough to be European. Well it is perfectly obvious in 2013 that this is no longer enough and we need to seek a wider destiny,' he said. .","A new report wants to make it easier for Australians to travel,work and live in the UK .

"A child minder whose weight reached 21st slimmed down more than seven dress sizes in time to fit into her 'fairytale' wedding dress. Despite years of dieting, Katie Bernasconi, 34, only found a lasting solution to her weight gain when she underwent an NHS gastric bypass operation which resulted in her losing 10st. Newly confident, she was able to fit into her dream wedding dress when she married her partner of 17 years, market trader Ray Bernasconi, 37. Scroll down for video . Katie lost 10st following an NHS bypass, dropping from 21st  and size 24 (left) to  10st 11lb and a size 10 (right) The picture of Katie, far left, on holiday in 2010 which finally persuaded her to choose bariatric surgery . Katie says she was comfortable and happy with Ray (pictured left), which allowed her fall into bad eating habits . She said: 'By the time we tied the knot we had been engaged for six years. I knew I wanted to be with Ray for the rest of my life, but I had put the wedding off time and time again because I simply did not want to be a big bride. 'Everyone saw me as a happy, assertive woman, but inside I was deeply insecure. Every time I imagined myself as an overweight meringue waddling down the aisle, I felt ashamed of myself. 'Once the weight had gone, a switch was flipped and I was desperate to go ahead with the ceremony. We organised our wedding within ten weeks. I was over the moon.' Mrs Bernasconi, of Westminster, met her future husband when she was a still a teenager and went on to have two children with him: Aaron, now 14, and Jamie, now nine. As her weight rose, Katie began finding even basic things such as walking a struggle and had joint pain . She said: 'I quickly became comfortable with my life with Ray. He was so sweet and I felt perfectly safe with him. I found myself falling into bad habits - eating crisps and chocolate and going for convenience meals like takeaways or ready meals.' By the time the couple got engaged in January 2006, Katie was wearing size 18 clothes. She said: 'I proposed to Ray because I wanted him to know how committed I was. When he said yes I was overjoyed but I also felt sad because I knew we wouldn't be getting married soon - I was determined to slim down first. 'I tried dieting - every programme and fad you can think of - but I just put it back on again. Whenever our thoughts turned to setting a date for the wedding, we put it back.' Katie, front, with her sister Laura on Laura's wedding day in a size 20 dress . When she hit her heaviest weight of 21st 2lb in 2008, wearing size 24 clothing, she began to experience health problems. She said: 'I couldn't walk for a few minutes without needing to sit down. I became breathless really easily and had terrible pains in my knees. 'The boys used to love going on roller coasters at theme parks, but I wouldn't even bother queuing up because I knew I wouldn't fit on. I wouldn't have been able to face the humiliation.' In April 2009 Mrs Bernasconi's younger sister Laura Stokes, now 30, announced she was getting married. Knowing of her sister's desire to slim down, Mrs Stokes ordered two gold bridesmaids dresses - one in a size 14 and another in size 20. Mrs Bernasconi said: 'I broke down in tears when I realised the size 14 wouldn't even cover my thighs. I'd dreamed of looking perfect on Laura's big day, but I had failed.' Seeking a lasting solution, in 2010 Mrs Bernasconi visited her GP who said her obesity-related health problems meant she was eligible for bariatric surgery on the NHS. She said: 'I put it off at first because I wanted to research all the risks, but a photograph of my on holiday later that year made me reach breaking point. Someone pointed out I was taking up half the photo - even though there were nine other people in the shot.' In September that year her husband held her hand as she was wheeled into theatre at Charing Cross Hospital in London for her gastric bypass operation. Just three months later, she had lost 5st and within a year her weight had plummeted to 10st 11lb. Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Triple-pack of chicken sandwiches . Dinner: Large pepperoni pizza . Snacks: Sandwiches, crisps and sweets . Breakfast: Boiled or scrambled eggs . Lunch: Home made chicken soup . Dinner: Grilled sea bass and vegetables . Snacks: Nothing . They finally got married at Q Vardis in Uxbridge in June 2012, when Mrs Bernasconi wore a size 10 dress. She said: 'Once I got below 11st I knew it was time to get cracking on the wedding. 'The day was absolutely perfect. It was like a fairytale. For years I had dreaded walking down the aisle, but it felt incredible to feel all those eyes on me and not feel ashamed by my figure. 'Underneath the wedding dress, I wasn't particularly comfortable. The figure-hugging dress supported the saggy skin I'd been left with after the weight loss. Katie and Ray finally got married in June 2012, when Mrs Bernasconi wore her dream size 10 dress . 'Luckily, people didn't notice. People I hadn't seen for years couldn't recognise me because I looked so different.' Faced with unsightly and irritating saggy skin, Mrs Bernasconi had an all-round tummy tuck on the NHS in September 2013. She also spent £6,500 on private operations to lift and reshape her breasts. She is currently waiting to see whether she can have a further skin-removal operation on the NHS, which would give her the figure she has always dreamed of. In the meantime she has managed to keep the weight off by overhauling her diet. At her heaviest weight she typically ate nothing for breakfast, followed by a triple-pack of chicken sandwiches for lunch, followed by a large pepperoni pizza for her evening meal. She would snack on sandwiches, crisps and sweets throughout the day. Katie had an all-round tummy tuck on the NHS in September 2013. She also spent £6,500 on private operations . Today, she typically eats boiled or scrambled eggs for breakfast, followed by home made chicken soup for lunch, with grilled sea bass and vegetables for her evening meal. She does not tend to snack during the day. She said: 'Ray and I have learned how to cook healthy meals from scratch so we don't need to buy takeaways anymore, and I don't even miss them. 'I can do anything I like now - I can even run around with the kids, and wear anything I like. 'Ray has stood by me through thick and thin. He's the perfect husband. I'll never go back to the way I was.'","Katie met Ray when she was a  teenager and pair have two children .

"Suspension: Math teacher Brooke Hesson (pictured left with unidentified man) has been placed on leave from her Arizona school over allegations she had sex with a student . A high school math teacher and cheerleading coach has been placed on administrative leave while an Arizona school district investigates allegations she slept with a male student. However, the Tempe Police Department says they will not bring up charges against teacher Brooke Hesson, because the student was 18 at the time and issued consent. 'Because he's 18 (and) everything was consensual, there's no crime and we're not pursuing any charges,' Sgt Mike Pooley of the Temple Police told The Arizona Republic. 'We're still investigating to make sure there was no inappropriate conduct prior to him being 18 and there were no other students involved that were under 18,' he added. Hesson is married and has been working at Marcos de Niza High School since 2010. School administrators found out about the allegations after receiving a student tip, Sgt Pooley said. Tempe Union High School District immediately placed Hesson on administrative leave on October 17 while they investigate the charges. 'She was placed on administrative leave and is under investigation of misconduct, but we don't have all the facts yet,' Tempe Union High School District spokesman Jill Hanks said. 'We received allegations Friday afternoon and under protocol sent her home.' According to a profile on the school's website, Hesson teaches Algebra 1-2, Algebra 3-4 and Functions of Mathematics. She received her bachelor's degree from Arizona State University. A letter was sent home to the parents' of Hesson's students and cheer squad members, explaining her absence was due to 'allegations of misconduct'. School administrators have not said whether Hesson would be returning to teaching.

"Most Ferris wheels rely on a motor to keep them turning - but not at this amusement park in India. The attraction in the state of Himachal Pradesh, in Northern India, is instead turned by human workers. Two men are employed to stand on the spokes at the centre of the wheel and keep it turning as visitors ride in cars to take in the view. People power: The two acrobatic workers are seen using their legs to get the Ferris wheel moving . A video has emerged showing daredevil workers clambering over the wheel in an attempt to keep it spinning. The video was uploaded by Manohar Thakur who filmed the footage on Friday, October 24. Mr Thakur's boys Vijay and Ashok are seen in the video enjoying the attraction in Dhami, near Shimla in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Some of the adventurous workers scale the railings of the Ferris wheel and they use their body weight to accelerate the speed of the wheel, while other workers apply pressure from ground level. No safety equipment is involved - but it's not the first time human-powered Ferris wheels have been spotted in India, with several reported across the country. Movement: The two men jump around the centre of the ferris wheel to keep up the momentum . Feet: The man in the green t-shirt sticks out his right leg and pushes the steel frame .

"Lovingly stroking and snuggling your cat should be a comforting treat. But now pet owners have been warned that cuddling their feline can cause them stress. Research has revealed that more than half of people do not know how to cope with an anxious cat and think that petting them is the answer. Scroll down for video . Pet owners have been warned that stroking their pet cats could be causing more stress than relaxing them . Leading cat charity, Cats Protection, asked pet owners what they knew about caring for their moggy but found too many were letting the love of their pets cloud their judgement. Nicky Trevorrow, Cats Protection’s behaviour manager, said: ‘Being held or stroked for too long can be very stressful for some cats. ‘Space and peace is often what they need - they’re not small furry humans so what would comfort us won’t necessarily comfort them. ‘Owners love their animals and want them to be happy but our research has highlighted a lack of understanding of stress triggers for cats and how to deal with them.’ The charity also found that 55 per cent did not realise that living with another cat or dog can cause stress and 51 per cent failed to recognise wetting and soiling in the house as a sign of stress. Only a quarter knew that grooming a particular area all the time was an indication that their pet was suffering anxiety. Charity Cats Protection say the animals require space when they are feeling anxious not cuddles (file photo) And half were unaware that strange cats coming into the house also had an effect. It carried out the research for a BBC2 Horizon documentary, Cat Watch 2014, which follows the secret lives of 100 cats. The animals were tracked using GPS and micro-cameras and examined in three different environments. The series reveals the secret language of cats and why they meow, how they transformed from pampered pet to predator and how they see, hear and smell the world with the sense of their wild ancestors. It will be aired on Tuesday, October 7. 1. Try not to overly stroke or cuddle a cat which is showing signs of stress as it can make it worse. 2. Always provide your cats with easily accessible places to hide and let them stay in there for as long as they want to. A hiding place makes them feel safe and secure and can be something as simple as a cardboard box on its side or upside down. Or you could buy an igloo-style cat bed. 3. Cats feel safer if they can view their surroundings from up high, so make sure they can access somewhere like the top of the wardrobe or a high shelf. 4. Make sure there is enough food, water and litter trays for the all of the cats in the household. The ideal number of litter trays is one per cat plus one extra. 5. Install a microchip or magnetic cat flap, which lets your cats into your property and keeps neighbouring cats out. For owners who want to understand more about feline behaviour, Cats Protection offers an online learning tool which can be accessed here.","Research revealed 53% of people don't know how to cope with stressed cats .

"Radicalised Australian children, as young as six, have been shown calling for an end to democracy and Australia’s way of life in a shocking extremist video. Four children, reportedly aged 6 to 13, claim that they want American President Barack Obama to go to hell and chant ‘O Bashar we want your head,’ about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in a video that was unearthed by Channel Seven. The disturbing footage was filmed at an event held by The Muslim Youth Project and is thought to have happened in December last year. The young people sing ‘until Islam there is no rest’, as they wave Islamic flags. And the smallest states: ‘You’re never too young to be a Soldier of Khilafah.’ Scroll down for video . In a video filmed at an event held by The Muslim Youth Project last year children as young as six are seen chanting about ending democracy . Two bearded men flank the boys as the sing and Channel Seven has identified the man leading the chant as Bilal Merh, a senior figure in the radical group Hizb ut Tahrir. Back in 2011, Merhi urged Australians to join shun moderate forms of Islam and reject democracy during a Khilafah Conference in Australia, called Uprising In The Muslim World… on the road to Khilafah. He spoke to around 100 people on behalf of the radical Islamic group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is trying to create a caliphate in the Middle East. The group tells Muslims in Australia that they too should reject democracy. The smallest boy in the video states: 'You're never too young to be a Soldier of Khilafah' The children sing that they want Obama to go to hell and that they want Assad's head . The large man on the right hand side of the video is reportedly radical speaker Bilal Merh . The Muslim Youth Project, which has another event coming up on Saturday which only men are invited too, says on its Facebook page that it aims to ‘engage with young Muslims of all ages and on all levels to discuss the issues that really matter to us’. ‘We hold various regular gatherings (fortnightly), events and initiatives (for brothers) that are engaging and interactive. ‘Islam is the project of all Muslims, and young Muslims are particularly capable of carrying the message of Islam, with their plentiful zeal and energy,’ the page says. Channel Seven has identified the man leading the chant as Bilal Merh, a senior figure in the radical group Hizb ut Tahrir (pictured) After Channel Seven aired the video, Uthman Badar, Hizb ut-Tahrir’s spokesperson, took to Twitter to call the report a ‘beat up’ and the producers ‘simpletons’. ‘Memo to simpletons at Ch. 7 ""breaking"" another beat-up tonight: the black flag with white shahada script & vice-versa have been around and used by Muslims long before ISIS. It is not an ""ISIS flag"". Don't let facts get in the way of more Islamophobic sensationalism tho [sic],’ he wrote. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Hizb ut-Tahrir and the Muslim Youth Project for comment. Monash University terror expert Professor Greg Barton told Daily Mail Australia that as the video was filmed last year - before new terror laws were brought in - charges against those involved in the video will probably not be laid. However, he warned that Hizb ut-Tahir wouldn't get away with the same rhetoric in Australia now. Uthman Badar, Hizb ut-Tahrir’s spokesperson, took to Twitter to call the report a ‘beat up’ and the producers ‘simpletons’ Hizb ut-Tahrir calls itself a global Islamic political party. It is known for its extreme ideologies . Badar said on Twitter that the flags in the video were not ISIS flags because they were used before ISIS used them . ‘The group involved is always vocal on grabbing headlines and staying on the right side of the law… the new terror legislation would give them trouble now. ‘It used to be about a fictional caliphate but now it is actually being fought for in the Middle East,’ he added. Professor Barton highlighted that ‘apart from anything else this is about bad parenting’. ‘It happens with every community group group, parents doing dumb things with their kids, whether its fire arms, drugs or alcohol, it’s reckless idiot parenting but from a small section of the Australian Muslim society,’ he said. Professor Barton said extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir always ensure they stay on just the right side of the law so that they don’t get banned. ‘If we respond to them we make them look more legitimate and give them the high ground,’ Professor Barton warned. The video of the young radicalised Australian children emerged days after 17-year-old Australian Abdullah Elmir appeared in an ISIS video rant against western society last week. He left the country in June to join the terrorist group who are fighting in Syria and Iraq. The Sydney teenager gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in a YouTube video.

"Heart-wrenching: People donated $114,000 to Shanesha Taylor after this mug shot emerged . A single mom who was arrested for leaving her children in her hot car while she went for a job interview has missed the court-imposed deadline to set up a trust fund for them. Shanesha Taylor, 35,  received a staggering $114,000 in donations from strangers after she was pictured crying in her mugshot following her arrest in Scottsdale, Arizona in March. As part of a deal to avoid felony child abuse charges, Taylor agreed to establish a $60,000 trust fund for her children with some of the money. But on Monday, it emerged in court that she had not yet set up the funds - $30,000 for education and $30,000 for childcare - because she fears she will need the money before her children turn 18. She told a judge in the settlement conference that she still hasn't found a job to support her kids and may need to tap into that money. She argued that the required amount was too much and requested it be reduced to $35,000. The judge asked if she would be willing to show the state her bank records so authorities can determine whether she has made big purchases and if it is necessary to renegotiate the agreement. Taylor told the judge that the money is in her mother's bank account and her mom may not want her to disclose the records. She then suggested funding the accounts with $35,000 instead of the $60,000 previously agreed. If prosecutors decide to allow another agreement, they will meet Wednesday to hash out the details. All smiles: Taylor, pictured in July after learning that she would avoid prosecution, was supposed to put $60,000 of the donations into trust funds for her children - but she has not . 'She's concerned about her future,' said her attorney Benjamin Taylor, who is working pro bono, Fox10 reported. 'She doesn't have a job right now. The fund is helping her survive.' The single mother-of-three and Air Force veteran was initially barred from seeing her children after she was arrested on March 20 for leaving her two sons - aged six months and two years - alone in her car for 45 minutes while she went for an interview. A witness found the baby crying hysterically and sweating profusely as temperatures inside the SUV topped 100 degrees. According to court documents, firefighters found the vehicle's windows rolled down an inch and no running air conditioning to keep the children cool. Single mother: She has three children, including two young sons she left in a hot car during a job interview . Scene: A passerby spotted the crying children who were inside the car as their mother went to an interview at an insurance company in Scottsdale, pictured. Authorities said temperatures topped 100F inside the car . Her children were taken to hospital on the day of her arrest but were not found to have suffered any injuries. They were placed with family and Taylor was eventually allowed to see them under supervision. She regained custody of her children in August and Maricopa County prosecutors agreed to dismiss abuse charges against her if she successfully completed a 26-week diversion program and set up the trust funds. The story made national headlines after Taylor's emotional mug shot emerged, and she revealed that she had acted out of desperation after the babysitter pulled out at the last minute. 'It was me knowing my family was in crisis and knowing that I had to make a choice between providing for my children or caring for my children,' she told Matt Lauer on the Today show earlier this summer.","People from across the country donated $114,000 to Shanesha Taylor after she was pictured sobbing in her mug shot following her March arrest .

"A man, who was brutally bashed on a train after stepping in to defend two women, speaks out about how his actions were intended to prevent any violence from erupting. 'Paul', as he has been identified, was on the train from Sydney Olympic Park to Central after the Penrith-Canterbury semi-final when he saw an argument between two women and two men. Deciding to go over and calm things down before the situation got out of control, he came away from trying to keep the peace with a broken nose, two black eyes and 24 stitches to a gash on his head and lip. Scroll down for video . Paul came away from trying to keep the peace with a broken nose, two black eyes and 24 stitches to a gash on his head and lip . The 48-year-old was covered in blood after a vicious attack from two men. The culprits fled at Sydney's Central Station. 'I thought I'd just ask the fellas to leave it alone and walk away, to just quieten everything down,' Paul told 9NEWS. 'There were innocent people on the train and these people were getting quite overheated. 'I didn't want it to escalate to the stage where there was any violence.' One of the men moved to sit down in a different part of the train, but his friend starting throwing punches. 'Loads of punches were being thrown, one of the guys pinned my arms to my side while the other one threw punches,' Paul said. He managed to headbutt the attacker - the 48-year-old's only option without the use of his arms. Emergency services were called to the scene and paramedics took Paul to St Vincent's Hospital . The culprits fled from Central railway station, where paramedics came to Paul's aid. Police confirm that at 11.50pm, the victim was travelling on a city-bound train from Olympic Park with a man and two women after the Bulldogs-Panthers clash. Two men boarded the train at Strathfield Station and struck up a conversation with the group. 'By the time the train reached Redfern, the 48-year-old man was concerned the conversation had become offensive,' said a NSW Police spokesperson. 'He approached the other two men in an attempt to de-escalate matters.' Witnesses say Paul was assaulted between Redfern Station and Central Station, at which point all parties left the train. Police take a statement from Paul at Central Station before he was taken by an ambulance to hospital . Police are yet to identify the perpetrators and are continuing inquiries into the alleged assault. They have released descriptions of the two men to the public. 'The first is described as being of Caucasian appearance and aged 25 to 30 years. When he was last seen, the male was wearing a black shirt. 'The second man is described as being of Caucasian appearance, with a ginger beard, of a medium build, and aged in his thirties. 'He was last seen wearing a black shirt with coloured bands around the midsection.' Police did not confirm reports that the two men were Penrith Panthers supporters.

"South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham spoke to an all-male, lily white group in Charleston this month – a political faux pas that would dog him days before an election, if he hadn't poked fun at them during his 20 minutes of remarks. 'I'm trying to help you with your tax status,' Graham quipped while open mics recorded his words. 'I'm sorry the government's so f***ed up. If I get to be president, white men in male-only clubs are going to do great in my presidency.' The joke was on them, but the crowd laughed. SCROLL DOWN FOR AUDIO . U.S. Sen Lindsey Graham campaigned for re-election on Wednesday while political wags turned the tables on him for a series of jokes he told at the Hibernian Club of Charleston . A short list of prominent organizations that don't welcome women or racial minorities still exist in the U.S. Augusta National Golf Club was one of the last stalwarts to fall. It excluded blacks until 1990 and admitted its first two female members in 2012. Graham didn't seem fazed by the political dynamite he toyed with, CNN reported Wednesday. He also bantered at the expense of the most populous religious group in the American South. 'We got any Presbyterians here? We got any Baptists?' Graham asked from the podium. 'They're the ones that drink and don't admit it.' A South Carolina Republican campaign strategist told MailOnline on Thursday that Graham's humorous approach was a deft political move. 'He had to try and be funny,' the operative said. 'The event would have attracted far more criticism, and serious complaints – the election is next Tuesday, for gosh's sake – if he showed up and gave a serious policy speech.' 'They would have swept him off the stage if he did than anyway. Those guys are brutal if you're boring. And it sounds like he was one of the more mild-mannered Hibernian speakers in a while anyway.' Graham has confirmed that recordings of the event are accurate, but emphasized that he wasn't serious. 'They are great guys,' he told CNN. The Hibernian Society, Graham continued, expects its speakers 'to be earthy, to make fun of yourself, to make fun of them. Then you say something serious and sit down.' 'And if you talk over 20 minutes, they throw something at you.' The society hosts an annual St. Patrick's Day banquet where Vice President Joe Biden and former Vice President Dick Cheney have spoken. No recordings of their remarks were readily available on Thursday, and the Hibernian Society couldn't be reached for comment. Two Democratic Party activists leaked the Graham audio to CNN. Graham is a shoe-in to win re-election and could conceivably run for president in 2016, but his reputation as a supporter of immigration 'amnesty' would make him unwelcome in many GOP circles . The group's iconic meeting place, Hibernian Hall, is legendary for episodes of far more significant American history. It hosted a faction of Democrats in 1860 who plotted to nominate Sen. Stephen Douglas to oppose Abraham Lincoln for the presidency a year before a devastating civil war – fought over black slavery – broke out in the U.S. Delegates slept in cots strewn all around the ornate building. Graham has floated the idea of a long-shot presidential campaign, but the GOP strategist said it won't happen. 'If Lindsey runs for president, he's going to be tarred and feathered by his own party for embracing President Obama's immigration proposals,' he said. 'They don't call him ""Graham-nesty"" for nothing,' he jabbed. Graham campaign spokesman Tate Ziegler told the Charleston Post and Courier that the senator's comments were 'delivered in a private roast-type dinner before a well-respected charity in Charleston'. Democratic state Sen. Brad Hutto, who is running an unlikely campaign to unseat him, took it all seriously. 'When behind the closed doors of a private club, Lindsey Graham let his true colors show,' Hutto said. 'He is only interested in his own ambitions and the best interests of the wealthy donors he hopes will fund his possible presidential campaign.'","Graham, a possible but unlikely presidential candidate, was poking fun at the group but recording could be politically embarrassing .

"Vince Cable today took aim at the leaders of the other main parties, claiming the Tories are merely 'UKIP without the beer'. He also poked fun at Ed Miliband's Labour party as pursuing French President Francois Hollande's brand of 'socialism without the sex'. In a well-received speech at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mr Cable also accused Chancellor George Osborne of 'lying' by claiming he could balance the nation's books without tax rises. And he called for more open immigration to Britain, insisting migrants from both inside and outside the EU have brought 'tangible benefits' to the UK. Scroll down for video . Business Secretary Vince Cable made clear his ongoing discomfort with sharing power with the Tories, accusing them of 'arrogance' and being 'obsessed' with cuts . Mr Cable used his speech to announce a higher minimum wage for apprentices and a review of the law for up to 1million workers who 'fall through the cracks and don’t currently have full employment rights'. But he turned his fire on both Labour and the Conservatives, as the Lib Dems try to make a clear pitch to voters to prevent a wipeout in 2015. Mr Cable said the two party conferences had helped the Lib Dems to understand their opponents better. 'The Tories are reinventing themselves as UKIP but without the beer, while the Labour party is offering us Hollande Socialism, but without the sex.' He insisted the Lib Dems had joined the coalition to rescue the economy, and have plenty to be proud of. But he made clear his ongoing discomfort with sharing power with the Tories, accusing them of 'arrogance' and being 'obsessed' with cuts. He insisted the deficit 'has to be dealt with' but rejected plans set out by Tory Chancellor George Osborne last week for the full £25billion needed to eradicate the deficit to come entirely from spending cuts. Mr Cable insisted the Lib Dems had joined the coalition to rescue the economy, and have plenty to be proud of . Mr Cable said Ed Miliband's Labour party is offering voters the socialism of French president Francois Hollande (right) 'but without the sex' The Tories also came under fire, with Mr Cable claiming David Cameron's party is 'obsessed' with spending cuts and is no more than 'UKIP without the beer' Mr Cable said key public services like legal aid, local government, policing and defence have already been 'cut to the bone'. He went on: 'The Tories are ideologically obsessed by cuts because they see it as a way of destroying public service and the welfare state, which they detest. 'Let us be clear. The Tories’ proposal to take another £25 billion or more out of welfare and unprotected Government departments will do great harm to valuable services: to imagine otherwise is fantasy. I will categorically not go along with this. Mr Cable called for more open immigration to Britain, insisting migrants from both inside and outside the EU have brought 'tangible benefits' to the UK . 'So you might ask what is the alternative? The truth is more taxes will be needed. To contribute to deficit reduction and also to address unacceptable inequalities.' In a direct swipe at Mr Osborne, he added: 'Any politician who tells you that the next Government can balance the budget and avoid tax increases is lying to you.' However, the move raises the prospect of the Lib Dems going into the election promising to hike taxes if they return to power after the election. Major splits have also emerged between the Tories and Lib Dems over immigration. David Cameron promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands, but since the coalition was formed the numbers arriving each year have topped more than 200,000, fueled mostly by large numbers arriving from elsewhere in the EU. But Mr Cable said the Tories were trying to 'close the borders to skills and talents that Britain needs, by pursuing an absurd net migration target – plucked out of the air and totally unenforceable'. He argued for more open immigration, accepting people coming to Britain to study or work. 'Overseas students, whose fees subsidise British students and earn £9bn a year for the UK, are discouraged and so go to the US or Australia instead. 'Firms who need specialist skills from Japan, India or the US have to climb piles of red tape (far bigger than anything generated by Eurocrats in Brussels). 'We then train Chinese engineers and insist they go home just when British industry can make good use of them. 'But, of course, there is always a warm welcome isn’t there for dodgy billionaires willing to make a large party donation for a game of tennis with Boris and Dave.' Mr Cable said the Lib Dems have a responsibility 'to tell the uncomfortable truth that the vast majority of migrants coming to the UK from inside or outside the EU have brought tangible benefits to the economy, importing valuable skills and strengthening our civic culture'. He added: 'Of course immigration does have to be controlled at the point of entry and exit. And we must deal with abuse and crack down on ‘benefit tourism’. 'But not at the expense of the EU Single Market, and its free movement of workers.' Urging Lib Dems to stand up to their rivals, he added: 'We have a real record of achievement in Government. In very difficult circumstances we have brought compassion, common sense and competence into Government: we have maintained our liberal and social democratic values in doing so; and we have stood up to the born-to-rule arrogance of our coalition partners as well as the narrow tribalism of the Labour opposition.

"A furniture shop refused to repair a pensioner's armchairs - after claiming she had ruined them with sweat caused by her medication. Grandmother Barbara Challons, of Mosborough, South Yorkshire, bought the two two-seater armchairs from Harveys Furniture Store three years ago and says they have always had problems. The company have sent her several spare parts but after repeated complaints they finally called at her home to fix them. A furniture shop refused to repair  armchairs owned by Barbara Challons (pictured) - after claiming she had ruined them with sweat caused by her medication . An inspector from Harveys asked her if she was on any medication and she replied 'yes'. The 79-year-old was later stunned to receive a letter saying the medication had caused her to sweat and 'contaminated' the £500 chairs - meaning staff could not repair them. Mrs Challons said: 'I'm upset about it. People will think I'm dirty and I'm not dirty. They will think my house is scruffy. 'What makes me so cross is that they're saying these chairs are greasy. I'm really hurt by what they've made me look. 'If they didn't want to fix the chairs, why couldn't they use a problem with the furniture as an excuse. 'Instead they've made a personal attack on me and my health. People will think ""what's wrong with her?""' The note from the company's repair partner, read: 'We have advised the customer that as she takes medication, this has affected the sofa. Barbara Challons bought the two two-seater armchairs from Harveys Furniture Store in Sheffield (pictured) three years ago and says they have always been plagued by problem . 'She does take high blood pressure tablets, this is unrepairable as now contaminated. 'The chairs are nearly three years old, this is from sweat through taking medication. No repair possible.' After receiving the letter Barbara showed it to her doctor who 'laughed at it' and described it as 'nonsense'. Widowed Mrs Challons, a retired auxiliary nurse, had applied for the chairs to be repaired by the shop. But the worker who visited her home asked her whether she was diabetic or on any blood pressure medication, to which she replied 'yes'. She said she later found this was used as a reason not to fix the chairs, which she said had been 'plagued with problems'. Mrs Challons added: 'It's a load of rubbish. To say my taking tablets damaged the chairs is unreal.' Mrs Challons said she had recently ordered two new armchairs, which are currently being handmade. She added: 'As soon as they arrive, I'm throwing these out. I can't wait to see the back of them.' Mrs Challons (pictured) was stunned to receive a letter saying the medication had caused her to sweat and 'contaminated' the £500 chairs - meaning staff couldn't repair them . The report (pictured) from the company's repair partner said there was 'no repair possible' Accompanying the report, Harveys said there was 'no manufacturing defect' and that she would need to pay an upholsterer to assess the chairs to challenge the decision. A spokesman from Harveys said: ‘Our Customer Service team have conducted a detailed review of Ms Challon’s concerns. 'Our technician carried out a thorough testing of the material and determined that, given the staining on the product, repairing it was not an option and also the age of the product, that we would not be prepared to offer any compensation. 'We do, however, appreciate that our technician could have handled the situation more sensitively. 'We have tried to contact Ms Challon to discuss the matter and offer a small goodwill gesture for any distress we may have caused in dealing with her concerns. 'As always, Harveys remains committed to offering the highest level of customer service to its customers and dealing with every issue fairly and transparently.’","Barbara Challons bought two armchairs from Harveys Furniture Store three years ago .

"Could this spell the end of unsightly underarm sweat patches? A better relationship between your new carpet and your dinner parties? For messy chefs in Australian kitchens at least, the latest in 'intelligent' fabrics could mean a much lighter wash load. An Australian start-up company has created 'hydrophobic' chef jackets and aprons that repel almost any liquid, including red wine and oil. Not even sweat will stick. Off a duck's back: The new 'hydrophobic' chef jackets repels water, wine and oil. 'As a chef I find it really difficult to keep my chef jacket white, and we like our jackets white for obvious professional reasons,' says Adrian Li, previous MasterChef Australia mentor and co-founder of Fabricor. 'There's nothing currently on the market which helps this apart from buying new jackets and washing them every day. So we decided to create a new range of chef jackets using nanotechnology that makes it water repellent and stain-proof.' Fabricor says its garments are not made with sprays which often contain carcinogenic chemicals. The hydrophobic properties are locked into the weave of the fabric. Former MasterChef mentor and Fabricor co-founder says chefs spend too much money and time on garments that don't last . No stain, no pain: Nanotechnology means not even red wine or tomato sauce will leave a mark on your hydrophonic shirts . The nanotechnology works by modifying the fabric molecules; attaching hydrophobic ‘whiskers’ to the fibres which makes liquids bead-up and roll off the fabric surface.The liquid that is repelled carries particles of dirt off with it, making it essentially self-cleaning. Fabricor has set up a Kickstarter fund to launch its products and says it hopes to move towards making similar stain-free garments for the medical industry in the future, including, medical garbs, nurses uniforms and lab coats. The Chef's jackets currently sell for $90 and the aprons from $30. Self-cleaning: Water rolls off the surface of the hydrophobic fabric, carrying any dirt along with it . Fabricor's chef whites are just the latest in intelligent nanotechnology fabric design in Australia. Last month, Melbourne clothing label Threadsmiths patented a 100% cotton waterproof T-shirt with similar technology. It too, was created without the use of harmful chemicals seen in many hydrophobic sprays in the U.S. 'The Cavalier shirt contains no aerosol applications and no dangerous chemicals, and is completely safe to wear - as a shirt should be,' says Threadsmith's Lewis Pitchford.

"A newlywed British couple claims their dream wedding on a picturesque island in Greece became a Greek tragedy when they were struck down by a nasty stomach bug. Debra and Christopher Cunliffe, from St Helens, Merseyside, said they and some of their family and friends suffered a bout of gastric illness while staying at the all-inclusive Lindos Princess Beach Hotel in Rhodes last May. The Cunliffes, who are now taking legal action, claim the hotel was dirty and they were served undercooked chicken during a package trip booked through tour operator Thomas Cook. Legal action: Christopher and Debra Cunliffe say their holiday was ruined when they and their guests fell ill . The bride and groom said their holiday, which doubled as their honeymoon, was ruined when they, their two young daughters - Jessica, five, and Megan, four - and some of their 20 guests, including family and friends, suffered diarrhoea, nausea and stomach cramps. Debra and Christopher Cunliffe are pictured on their wedding day with their daughters Jessica, 5, and Megan, 4 . Debra, a 31-year-old hospital housekeeper, said: ‘We really couldn’t wait to see all of our friends and family in Rhodes to celebrate our special day. 'All four of our immediate family, including our children, Jessica aged five and Megan aged four, fell very ill which completely ruined the entire day and the rest of our holiday. ‘To make matters worse, our guests spent a lot of their time in their hotel rooms as they began to suffer from similar symptoms and missed out on the celebrations. ‘The day after the wedding was Megan’s birthday but we could not celebrate this in the normal way that we would have liked. 'The holiday was also our honeymoon which was also ruined because of how unwell we were feeling.' Some family members had to seek medical assistance once they returned home from the four-star resort, the couple said. Debra added: ‘We were very disappointed with the conditions at the resort and the hygiene standards were in my opinion very poor.’ The Cunliffes have instructed travel lawyers with Irwin Mitchell to investigate the cause of their illness. The law firm said it has been approached by 15 other holidaymakers who claim they were served undercooked or lukewarm food in a cat-infested restaurant while staying at the resort on the Aegean Sea. The guests also claim the hotel’s swimming pool was ‘filthy’ and its public toilets were not clean. Jennifer Downing, a personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘For Debra and Christopher, their holiday was supposed to be the best days of their lives as they got married, but instead they were unable to enjoy their special occasion with their loved ones because many of their guests were unable to join in throughout the celebrations.’ The Cunliffes say some family members had to seek medical assistance once they returned home . Holidaymakers claim they were served undercooked or lukewarm food at Lindos Princess Beach Hotel . In a statement, Thomas Cook said a ‘small number’ of hotel guests reported a stomach bug, usually lasting 24 to 48 hours, last May. The tour operator said: ‘Preliminary indications suggested that this was of a viral nature and as a precautionary measure Thomas Cook commissioned independent hygiene consultants to work with the hotel to ensure that the highest possible standards were being maintained.’ A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: ‘We know how important holidays are to our customers and how upsetting it can be when they fall ill while overseas. 'Our resort team offered guests in residence at the time their support, and our customer services team liaised closely with the Cunliffe party on their return to with a view to resolving their concerns directly. Nightmare: The Cunliffes claim they were served undercooked chicken and that hygiene was poor at the hotel . The Greek island of Rhodes lures tourists with its beaches, crystal clear waters and archaeological sites . ‘However, we have been approached by a no-win, no-fee lawyer that the Cunliffe party have chosen to act as their legal representative. 'While our investigation into the illness continues, we are unable to provide further comment so as not to unduly influence any potential legal proceedings. ‘We are confident that those due to stay at the Lindos Princess Beach Hotel will experience the excellent levels of quality and standards they would expect from Thomas Cook.’ The London-based company said the type of incident that the Cunliffes experienced is rare and it routinely undertakes independent third party audits to ensure the highest hygiene standards are met.

"A student who was bodyslammed by an Ohio State football coach after running onto the field during a game on Saturday is losing his full tuition and housing scholarship, his attorney has said. Anthony Wunder, 21, who has been charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing, will be removed from the Evans Scholars program for former golf caddies, defense attorney Mark Collins said. The fourth-year mechanical engineering student's attorney entered a not-guilty plea in Franklin County Municipal Court on his behalf on Tuesday. But afterwards, the sponsoring Western Golf Association released a statement  saying his scholar activities have been suspended but he will remain on scholarship until its investigation is complete. Scroll down for video . Slammed: Ohio State conditioning coach Anthony Schlegel, a former Buckeyes linebacker, body slammed Anthony Wunder after he ran onto the field during gameplay on Saturday . 'We are disappointed in Mr. Wunder's actions,' the statement read. Wunder was stopped and slammed down by assistant strength and conditioning coach Anthony Schlegel, a former linebacker for the Buckeyes, during Ohio State's home victory over Cincinnati. Coach Urban Meyer said he had a somewhat serious conversation with Schlegel about the massive hit, which was captured by photographers and shared across social media. 'I appreciated him protecting our players,' Meyer said. But 'I'd rather him not have a lawsuit if something bad would happen, you drill a guy like that. Charged: Wunder, left and in his mug shot right, has been charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing . 'So we had a partial-serious conversation. And we also gave him a 'Hit City' award, our team, and had a little fun with it, too.' Schlegel caught the fan as he ran away from security personnel, wrapping his arms around him and throwing him to the turf. The record crowd of 108,362 roared its approval. Wunder was then led off the field as Buckeyes players and team personnel congratulated Schlegel on the sideline. A complaint filed in Franklin County Municipal Court said Wunder, who is from Cincinnati, was drunk when he ran onto the field during Saturday's game, the Columbus Dispatch reported. He was booked into the Franklin County jail and released after posting a $79 bond on Sunday. Interception: As Wunder, a golf cady scholar, was caught by Schlegel as he ran away from security guards . Dragged away: He was led off the field as Buckeyes players and team personnel congratulated Schlegel . If convicted, he would serve a maximum of 30 days in jail. On his LinkedIn page, Wunder writes that he had secured the 'four year caddying scholarship based upon academics, caddy record, financial need, and character'. Schlegel, the coach who bodyslammed him, was drafted by the New York Jets before playing for the Bengals and the Florida Tuskers. He then headed back to Ohio to work for his alma mater.","Anthony Wunder 'was drunk when he ran onto the Ohio State field during their game against Cincinnati on Saturday'

"A referendum on Britain leaving the European Union would go ahead even if the Tories are forced to enter a second coalition with the Lib Dems, it emerged today. Senior Lib Dems indicated that they would not block David Cameron's promise of an in-out vote by 2017, with Nick Clegg saying he would 'relish' the battle to stay in the EU. But splits emerged at the party's conference in Glasgow, as Vince Cable insisted the referendum promised by the Tories is 'just not on offer as far as we are concerned'. Treasury minister Danny Alexander signalled he would be open to negotiating a referendum with the Tories in the event of another hung parliament . Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate a new deal with the EU, clawing back powers from Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum in 2017. Under pressure from Eurosceptics, Mr Cameron has made clear he will not argue for Britain to remain in the EU if it is not in the national interest. At last week's Tory conference, Mr Cameron said: 'We're going to go in as a country, get our powers back, fight for our national interest. 'And yes – we'll put it to a referendum, in or out – it will be your choice, and let the message go out from this hall: it is only with a Conservative Government that you will get that choice.' The Lib Dems had argued that there was no need to have a referendum unless more powers are transferred to Brussels – something which few expect to happen. However, at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mr Clegg and his closest ally Danny Alexander signalled that a referendum would not be a deal-breaker for a second coalition with the Tories. Mr Alexander, the Chief Treasury Secretary, told a meeting on the fringe of the conference: 'Clearly, we'd have to be able to come to an agreement which was satisfactory to both parties.' And pressed further on the issue later, Mr Alexander did not rule out talking to Tories about a referendum. 'We certainly haven't engaged in any discussions with any other party about what might happen after the election,' Mr Alexander said. 'We will certainly make the case in terms of what our priorities are and it will be up to the British people to decide which party has the strongest mandate. Of course, we would engage in conversations with them if that were to happen. 'I'm not going to get into trying to pre-negotiate coalition agreements on the result of an election which hasn't happened.' But Business Secretary Vince Cable insisted the Lib Dems would not sign up to the referendum being promised by the Tories . Officically the Lib Dems are in favour of a referendum on the EU if 'there is a change in the rules.' But Mr Clegg today said he would 'relish' an in-out referendum. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'The Conservative Party are tearing themselves up about Europe so they have now plucked out of thin air an arbitrary date - 2017 - when a referendum would take place. 'We have in law a guarantee about when a referendum will take place, when the rules of the game change. 'More than that, I say that the question on the ballot paper should be in or out and I would relish that moment.' However, Business Secretary Vince Cable appeared to rule out a deal with Tories on an in/out referendum, telling a separate fringe meeting: 'Our commitment to the EU is an absolute one ... We have made it clear that the kind of referendum the Tories want is just not on offer as far as we are concerned.' Mr Cable also warned that intimidation of pro-European companies could become a 'serious problem' if an in/out referendum was staged. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg insisted he would 'relish' the battle to keep Britain in the European Union . Eurosceptic Conservative ex-minister John Redwood was last week reported to have said that 'out' campaigners would 'make life difficult' for businesses which speak out in favour of continued EU membership in ways which would be 'deeply disruptive to their businesses, and maybe even to their own tenure of their jobs'. His remarks at last week's Conservative conference came after widespread complaints of the bullying of businesses which spoke out against Scottish independence in the recent referendum campaign. Mr Cable - who described himself as 'not a member of the John Redwood fan club' - said: 'The intimidation issue ... is potentially a serious problem if we do get to a referendum. 'I came up to Scotland during the long campaign and there were a lot of businesses who said they didn't wish to be publicly quoted. Sometimes it was for perfectly good industrial reasons - they didn't want their labour force, they didn't want their management to be quarrelling. They didn't want to alienate their customers, which is understandable. 'But some of them were frightened that there would be some kind of retribution. 'If we are getting - hopefully not - a European Union referendum, the last thing we need is for companies to be intimidated and prevented from saying what they really think.'","David Cameron wants to claw back powers before in-out vote in 2017 .

"A Sydney childcare worker felt 'contentment' when he reached up the skirt of a young girl and carried out actions that would destroy her life, a court has heard. Nikki Stoupe says that initial feeling was replaced by feelings of shame, shock and disgust when he realised what he had done to the young girl at an after-school care centre in Sydney's north-west. Stoupe has pleaded guilty to the aggravated indecent assault of the girl in 2012. A Sydney childcare worker felt 'contentment' when he reached up the skirt of a young girl and carried out actions that would destroy her life . He has also pleaded guilty to filming the girl on his mobile phone over a toilet door. The 29-year-old, who was employed by The Cubby House for six years, told the Parramatta District Court he developed inappropriate feelings for the victim in 2012. He said the victim, now 10, sometimes called him 'Daddy', which he grew to enjoy. In April 2012, he said he went to check on the victim - who was in the bathroom - and took out his mobile phone, put it over the door and started filming. Nikki Stoupe appeared in Parramatta District Court on Tuesday charged with aggravated indecent assault . He later accessed the footage once or twice. Three months later he picked up the victim and placed her on his knee as he sat behind his supervisor's desk. Stoupe said he put his hand up her skirt and touched her. 'At the time it was a sense of contentment ... it's a horrible thing to say,' he told a sentencing hearing. 'But I've since learned that was part of my mental state.' Despite feeling ashamed, he put the victim on his knee and assaulted her again in September 2012. A parent walked in on him and raised concerns with management which gave him a formal warning. The 29-year-old also filmed the girl while she was in the bathroom at The Cubby House in Sydney's north-west . Two weeks later, Stoupe assaulted her again in a storage room. Less than a week later, he was fired. Stoupe, who has obesity, said he was suicidal after the ordeal but has since accepted what he did. He was supported by his mother and siblings in court on Tuesday. 'I have destroyed her life,' he said. 'I have destroyed her family's life. I will never understand the sheer amount of damage I've done.' Asked about a report deeming he had a low-medium risk of re-offending, Stoupe said it would be inappropriate to say there would be no risk of re-offending. The hearing continues.","Nikki Stoupe was working in childcare at Sydney's The Cubby House .

"An Indiana pound dog is now on the road to recovery after his baffled caregivers finally discovered what was making his hair fall out and skin pitifully inflamed: he's allergic to humans. Adam, a black lab, showed up to Lucky Dog Retreat Rescue in Indianapolis back in June. Caregivers there hoped a healthy diet, baths and some much-needed love would allow his hair to grow back and cracked skin to heal. When none of it worked, a blood test revealed Adam's surprising diagnosis. Poor pooch: Adam, a rescued black Lab in Indianapolis, was found blistered and balding with wounds where he'd bitten and scratched at his body because of unbearable itching . Nothing worked: Adam was given baths, fed the best food and given extra love and attention but the terribly inflamed skin just wasn't improving the way his caregivers had hoped . 'Humans. I didn't believe her at first,' Robin Herman, who rescued Adam, said of the veterinarian's verdict. 'I thought she was kidding.' Just as humans can be allergic to dogs, they can apparently be allergic to us, Herman learned. More specifically, Adam is allergic to human dander--the minute particles we constantly shed from our skin and scalp. The intolerance was inflaming Adam's skin and driving him to scratch and bite at his rapidly balding body constantly. Shocking diagnosis: A blood test eventually revealed the problem--Adam is allergic to humans . Just like us: Specifically, Adam is allergic to human dander--the minute particles we constantly shed from our skin and scalp . When the itching was at its worst, the folks at Lucky Dog Retreat were forced to keep his head in a cone at all times. To combat the problem, Herman found a vet who could whip up a serum for Adam just like the allergy shots so often given to humans. And just as in people, the immunotherapy uses proteins of the allergen itself to slowly teach Adam's immune system to tolerate people. 'They just put a serum together, just like with kids' allergies and other dogs' allergies, and he starts on allergy shots this week,' Herman told KGO. Improving: Being in the hands of kind animal lovers dedicated to making him better has already helped Adam improve . Allergy shots: A veterinarian has created a special serum that will hopefully encourage Adam's immune system to better tolerate human dander--then his rescuers intend to find him a good home .","Indianapolis pound dog Adam lost much of his hair and was forced to wear a cone at all times because he was biting himself bloody .

"Peter Howes, 53, siphoned off his parents' cash and wound up a number of trusts by forging his brother and mother's signatures . A man has been jailed for four years after cheating his brother out of a £1.5million inheritance because he was fed up with him being the ‘favourite’ son. Peter Howes, 53, resented his brother Jonathan moving to Hong Kong and Singapore – leaving him to care for their elderly mother – and siphoned off cash from their parents’ estate. Howes wound up a number of trusts and settlements by forging the signatures of his mother Joyce and 55-year-old brother. He also cashed in two life insurance policies, worth just under £100,000 together. The family estate should have been split equally between the brothers, but Howes transferred cash into a joint account with his mother, before moving it into a sole account in his name. The cash was then handed to his former partners and used to buy a 40 per cent stake in an online gaming company. But the ploy unfolded when Mrs Howes died aged 81 and Jonathan discovered his brother’s deception during a conversation with lawyers. Following a three-week trial Howes was found guilty of five counts of fraud. Handing him four years and four months behind bars, Recorder James Watson QC described him as ‘ruthless’. ‘This is a case which involves an unusual blend of both tragedy and seriousness, and in light of … the seriousness of your dishonesty and scale of the sums involved, it seems to me that I have no choice but to adopt a lengthy period of custody. ‘On one level this case could be viewed simply as a breach of trust towards your mother, carried out in a systematic and methodical manner. Throughout this period your mother and brother trusted you to look after her. ‘You did this in one respect but in terms of her finances you failed her dishonestly. You failed her in … your judgment and you have been convicted of dishonesty and abuse, and that word abuse can be used in its full sense of your role.’ Bristol Crown Court heard that Howes’s father Thomas set up a number of trusts in 2002. The brothers were told proceeds of the estate ‘should be divided equally between them’ if both parents died. Howes, of Lechlade, Gloucestershire, was given prime responsibility for the trusts’ administration following his father’s death in August 2004. He wound up one settlement and gave half the proceeds – £109,000 – to his brother, convincing him the rest was still in the trusts. Howes was found guilty of five counts of fraud following a three week trial at Bristol Crown Court (pictured) But Howes began to look into other accounts, faking his mother’s signature to access the money and to close a settlement. It was only when Mrs Howes died in November 2010 and emails were sent between a solicitor and Jonathan regarding family trusts, that he discovered what his brother had done. In a victim impact statement, he said he did not bring the case to have his brother punished, but to bring to light what had happened. He added that his parents had intended the money to go towards their grandchildren. Ed Burgess, prosecuting, told the trial: ‘There is some talk of Jonathan always being the favourite son … But what is overwhelmingly obvious in this case is that [Howes] practised deceit, in order to take money he knew he was not entitled to … in excess of £1.5million.’","Peter Howes, 53, was fed up with his brother being the 'favourite son'

"He was the graffiti artist turned darling of the art world whose fans included Andy Warhol and Madonna before his death following an overdose in 1988 cut a promising career tragically short. But while Jean-Michel Basquiat is gone, his work lives on. Now prints of 35 of his most famous works are to go on sale in Selfridges for the first time. The collection, which starts at £90, even includes some of the Basquiat works that remain in private hands and haven't been seen since his death. Tragic: Basquiat, pictured with former girlfriend Madonna, died at the  young age of 27 after a heroin overdose . Striking though the pieces, which have been created in collaboration with Easyart, are, it's the artist's own tale that remains the most eye-catching part of the story. Born in a grotty part of Brooklyn, Basquiat's love of art was sparked by regular childhood trips to New York art galleries in the company of his mother, Matilda. But when she was committed to a mental institution when Basquiat was 11, his world fell apart and by the age of 15, the fledgling artist had run away from home and was supporting himself by making homemade t-shirts. Despite all the hardships, Basquiat's talent for art remained and by 1976, he was beginning to make a name for himself as part of the SAMO art collective with his friend Al Diaz. Popular: Basquiat's works, among them Asskiller (pictured), remain hugely popular . Stunning: 1984's Pez Dispenser was created during the final years of Jean-Michel Basquiat's career . Once firmly embedded in the predominantly white, New York art world, Basquiat collaborated with Andy Warhol and Keith Haring, and briefly dated a young Madonna, who described him as one of the few people she 'was truly envious of'. But he never was entirely able to escape his demons and by the mid 1980s, was regularly using drugs, including heroin. And when his close friend and collaborator Andy Warhol died in 1987, it sent Basquiat into a tailspin, worsening his drug addiction in the process. Just over a year after Warhol died, Basquiat too was dead - of a heroin overdose taken in his New York studio. He was just 27 years old. Flamboyant: Basquiat's 1982 work, Dustheads. The artist was also a close friend of Andy Warhol . Memorable: Works like Basquiat's 1982  Trumpets remain hugely popular with Nicky Minaj among others . Despite Basquiat's untimely death, his reputation has continued to grow with the artist dominating contemporary art sales. Last year, sales of his paintings totalled £126m, while contemporary fans include Leonardo DiCaprio, Nicki Minaj, ASAP Rocky and Frank Ocean. Another A-list fan, Jay-Z, has rapped about him and reportedly paid $4.5 million for Mecca at Sotheby’s last year. Speaking about the new prints, Easyart's Gyr King said: 'We’re delighted that anyone unfamiliar with Basquiat’s brilliance, or who has ever wanted one of his enigmatic works in their home, will now be able to, through our partnership with Selfridges, or by purchasing from Easyart.com.' Loved: This work, 1982 painting Mecca, was allegedly sold to Jay-Z for $4.5m at auction last year .","Prints of Jean-Michel Basquiat's work are set to go on sale in London .

"It is twice as wide as Buckingham Palace, has more than five miles of corridors, and has one room for every day of the year - and now Wentworth Woodhouse, Britain's largest privately owned stately home, has gone on sale for £7million. Former residents include the first Earl of Stafford and the second Marquess of Rockingham, who later went on to become Prime Minister. The house has featured in several period TV dramas, and plays a prominent role in the film biopic of artist J M W Turner. However, as well as getting their hands on a piece of history, the new owners will also inherit a huge repair bill, thought to be somewhere in the region of £42million, to fix subsidence caused by mining in the area and to repair older parts of the building. Grand: Wentworth Woodhouse is wider than Buckingham Palace, has more than five miles of corridors, and was once visited by King George V - and has now gone on sale for £7million . Vast: The property is the largest stately home in private hands, and even has a section dubbed 'the village' by the Newbold family who currently own it, because it takes so long to get to . Historic: The house was originally owned by Thomas Wentworth, administrator to King Charles I, and has since been owned by the Watson family and the Fitzwilliams. As well as inheriting a slice of history, the new owners could face a repair bill as high as £42million . The home is suffering from subsidence after the fourth Earl Fitzwilliam established mines around the home. Work continued there until 30 years ago, and the owners say the work has damaged the property . The current owners,  architect Clifford Newbold and his wife, has been seeking compensation of £100million from the Coal Authority, but the case has yet to be resolved, according to The Times. After the coal pits were nationalised following the end of the second world war, Labour minister for power and energy Manny Shinwell, an outspoken critic of the aristocracy, allowed mining virtually up to the back door. The local miners protested, and threatened to go on strike over the poor treatment of the Fitzwilliam family, who owned the home at the time, because of their reputation as a generous employer who built schools, invited villagers to parties in the grounds and paid workers handsomely. Mr Newbold, who bought the home for just £1.5million along with his three sons in 1999, has spent £5million upgrading the plumbing, electrics and heating, but even that investment has left much more to be done. Speaking to The Times, the family said in a statement: 'We fell in love with Wentworth Woodhouse 15 years ago, buying it to save it from neglect and to try and find a sustainable future for this wonderful piece of history. 'Our father is nearly 90 and he does not have the energy he once had; it is his and our greatest wish to find someone to carry on our work. 'The most important thing is to see the house in safe hands and secure the preservation of the finest Georgian interiors in the country for future generations to enjoy.' Up to date: In modern times the house has made a name for itself as the backdrop to various period dramas, and features as the Royal Academy in the new film Mr Turner . Action: Timothy Spall as artist JMW Turner films a scene in one of Wentworth Woodhouse's 365 rooms . Within the 250 acres of grounds are 22 listed buildings. The house itself dates back to the 17th century, although little of the original building now remains, having been largely replaced in the 18th century. The property was perhaps the largest of the estates in the country at the time of its creation and was home to Thomas Wentworth, administrator for Charles I, who was executed in 1641 for treason and is buried nearby. The estate passed to his son and heir, and on his death in 1695, was inherited by the Watson family, who later became the Watson-Wentworths. Thomas Watson-Wentworth, the second Earl of Rockingham, made the home into a Whig political stronghold in the mid-1700s and served as Prime Minister twice, though died during his second term. In 1782 the ownership again changed hands, this time being inherited by the fourth Earl Fitzwilliam who established mines and factories in the surrounding area during the industrial revolution, making the family the sixth richest in the country. Sprawling: The house and its out-buildings stretch over three acres to themselves, covered by 22 Grade II listings, and sit in 250 acres of grounds . Luxurious: The house expanded greatly under the Fitzwilliam family, who rose to became the sixth wealthiest in Britain, and at one point employed more than 1,000 people, including a rat catcher and a state bed maker . Prestigious: Thomas Watson-Wentworth, the second Earl of Rockingham, made the home a Whig political stronghold in the mid-1700s and served as Prime Minister twice . As a sign of their wealth, at one time in 1841 there were more than 1,000 people employed at the house, with jobs including 'rat catcher' and 'state bed maker', with the local village being almost entirely dependent on the house for survival. In 1912, the house was visited by King George V and his wife Queen Mary, with the Royal family taking up a grand total of 76 bedrooms. The Fitzwilliam family, along with their magnificent house, were also thought to be the inspiration for Fitzwilliam Darcy - otherwise known as Mr Darcy - from Jane Austen's Pride And Prejudice. According to legend, guests were once guided back to their rooms using coloured confetti because the property was so large, and the current owners have dubbed one part of it 'the village' - because it takes so long to get to. The house passed into private hands after the death of the tenth Earl Fitzwilliam in 1979. Since then it has gained fame as a backdrop to TV series including the 1999 show Wives And Daughters, and will feature in the upcoming BBC series Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. Wentworth Woodhouse also stands in for London's Royal Academy in Mr Turner, the new biopic of J M W Turner that won Timothy Spall a best actor award at Cannes for his portrayal of the artist.

"Derek Percy, who died last year, has been found guilty of the death of a Melbourne child . Convicted child killer Derek Percy is responsible for the death of seven-year-old Melbourne girl Linda Stilwell who vanished 46 years ago, an inquest has found. Percy had demonstrated a capacity to commit a heinous act and his writings demonstrate an intent in torturing, killing and mutilating children, Victoria's deputy state coroner Iain West found. 'It is highly unlikely that another child molester was in the vicinity when Linda disappeared,' Mr West said. 'I am satisfied it is more probable that Derek Percy would have taken advantage of an opportunity presenting itself than anyone in the vicinity not so affected by such a rare and dangerous condition.' Mr West said witness descriptions of a man seen loitering near Linda before she vanished matched Percy's appearance at the time, and witness descriptions of the vehicle matched the one Percy drove. Linda disappeared from the St Kilda foreshore near Melbourne's Luna Park on August 10, 1968. Mr West made an interim finding in 2009 that Percy was in the area at the time. At the time of his death in July last year, 64-year-old Percy was Victoria's longest serving prisoner and had been linked to child killings in four states. Scroll down for video .

He abducted and killed 12-year-old Yvonne Tuohy in Victoria in 1969, but was found not guilty on the grounds of insanity and ordered to remain in jail indefinitely. Mr West on Thursday said he took into consideration a statement from Professor James Ogloff, who said Yvonne was unlikely to have been Percy's first attack. Yvonne was killed 11 months after Linda disappeared. In an emergency bedside hearing before he died, Percy denied any involvement in Linda's disappearance, despite earlier saying he couldn't remember. 'Percy had a capacity to make false denials, as was demonstrated in the Yvonne Tuohy case,' Mr West said. Linda's mother Jean Priest (right) has been fighting for years to make Percy give evidence. She and her son Gary Stilwell (left), seen here outside court on Thursday, have continued to fight for justice . The brother of Linda Stilwell, Gary Stilwell, appeared emotional outside the Coroners Court in Melbourne . He formally found Linda Stilwell was deceased, having met her death by foul play. 'I find that Derek Percy caused the death of Linda Stilwell,' Mr West said. Linda's mother Jean Priest broke down as Mr West delivered his findings. Mrs Priest, who fought for years to have Percy say what happened to Linda, says the family has been through hell, but the coroner's ruling feels like closure. 'We just hope that eventually someone will find her remains so that we can give her a decent funeral and show her the respect she deserves,' Ms Priest says. 'But this has been marvellous today ... a form of closure, yes. 'I would have liked to have got the full answers, but it doesn't look as though we'll ever get them.' Victoria Police Detective Senior Sergeant Wayne Newman, who worked on the Stilwell cold case, said he has no doubt that Percy would have gone on to kill again had he been released.

"It is one of the great dilemmas of modern parenting – should you ever allow your teenage children to sleep over with boyfriends or girlfriends. Billy Connolly has revealed that one of his biggest rows with wife Pamela Stephenson was over whether their daughters should be allowed to spend the night with their boyfriends. The comedian, who has three daughters, Daisy, 28, Amy, 26, and Scarlett, 23, with Miss Stephenson, insisted most fathers are against the idea. Daddy's girls: Billy Connolly, pictured with daughters Scarlett (left) and Amy, revealed he disagreed with his wife over whether they should be allowed to spend the night with their boyfriends . Connolly said that when his children were younger the debate about how to handle sleeping arrangements with boyfriends was the last big fight he could remember in their family life. ‘We argued about kids sleeping over. The question is, do you let your children sleep with their lovers at home or elsewhere,’ he said. ‘You will find that when it comes to daughters most women are for it, and most men are against it.’ The 69-year-old also revealed that the transformation of his daughters from sweet girls doting on their father to angry teenagers came as a shock to him. He told of being ‘bitterly wounded’ after one of his daughters, at the age of 14, screamed at him to ‘get out of my room!’. He explained: ‘I never thought she would speak to me like that. I was delusional, living in fairyland, which I’ve done most of my life.’ The debate about whether to let teenage children stay with their boyfriends has raged in recent months. Some parents believe it is better to know where their offspring are rather than forbid behaviour that is likely to happen anyway. Others take a more conservative view. In a Daily Mail interview, academic Amy Schalet said the reason the US and the UK rates of teen pregnancy are eight and seven times higher than the Netherlands is that Dutch parents adopt a far more liberal approach. Two-thirds of those in Holland allow their teenagers’ partners to sleep over, she claimed. Clash: Pamela Stephenson disagreed with her husband over sleeping arrangements . Speaking about her book on teenage relationships, Not Under My Roof, she said: ‘In Dutch families there is an expectation that sex should take place in steady relationships in which both teens are in love. Dutch parents don’t want teenage sex to be a secret. ‘They want to stay connected with their teens and be able  to exercise influence and provide support.’ But David Spellman, a consultant clinical psychologist working with teenagers and families in East Lancashire, believes parents are misguided if they think all teenagers are eager to have sex. He said: ‘Not all 16-year-olds are the same. I can understand parents wanting to know where their teenagers are, but I don’t think it’s a convincing argument for allowing partners to sleep over. ‘It’s not right to assume that teenagers will have sex whether you allow it under your roof or not. Not all teenagers want to have sex early, so there might be a danger in making it too easy – it could encourage sex to happen sooner than it otherwise would.’ Connolly raised the issue in an interview with Australian newspaper The Age. The subject of family life came up as he promoted his Disney Pixar film Brave, in which he provides the voice of King Fergus, a Highland warrior. In it he and wife Queen Elinor have to deal with their rebellious daughter Merida, who wants to become a soldier. The star has two children from his first marriage to Iris Pressagh – Jamie, 42, and Cara, 38. Comedienne-turned-psychotherapist Miss Stephenson, 62, and Connolly have been together for more than 30 years and have been married since 1989. In a 2011 interview, she talked frankly about sex and fidelity, saying: ‘I don’t ask [about other women] and I don’t care. I think monogamy’s hard for anybody. ‘If you spend a lot of time apart and you suspect your partner might occasionally dabble, isn’t your priority to make sure he’s being sexual with someone he’s safe with?’","Comedian Billy Connolly clashed with wife Pamela Stephenson over whether their daughters' sleeping arrangements .

"Gary Glitter is to go on trial on a new charge of trying to rape an eight-year-old girl at his home in the 1970s. A High Court judge has granted permission for the case against the 70-year-old singer to go ahead after a rare request by prosecutors. They took the step as a magistrate had ordered the charge to be stayed, or legally put on hold, in 1998 because of a delay in bringing it to court. Gary Glitter is to go on trial on a new charge of trying to rape an eight-year-old at his home in the 1970s . Mr Justice Globe said he did not regard it as unfair that Glitter should face the extra charge. However, he added: ‘My decision in this case is not a green light to prosecutors to seek to resurrect old cases.’ Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, has already been accused of eight charges of sex offences against two girls of 12 and 14 from 1975-80. The assaults are alleged to have happened at hotels or a nightclub.

"Feeders and fetishes - the perils of online dating as a plus size lady . Taking the plunge and signing up to a dating website can be one of the most daunting acts in a single person's life. But for single mother Verity Brown, the experience has almost put her off completely - because as a size 24, her figure has either deterred the right type of man, or attracted the wrong kind. The 38-year-old from Birmingham has been approached by feeders, dominatrix-lovers and even men who are turned on by toilet habits. Verity Brown, 38, had stopped dating online after regularly being told she's too overweight by dates . But while the stories have provided her friends with a constant stream of hilarious stories, it has ended up with the former beauty queen eventually dropping her search for a new partner completely. Verity, who works as a self-employed recruiter, first subscribed to online dating with the website Plenty Of Fish in March of this year. She said: 'I think because I had heard success stories from other people who had tried online dating that I thought I would give it a try, as I had nothing to lose. 'With work and being a single mum I am very busy and going out is not a luxury that you always have the option of. Verity at the Miss Plus Size International beauty pageant in 2013, where she won the crown . 'I was very honest about my size as I always have been, I have also lost a bit of weight in the last year, going from a size 30 to a size 24. 'So I thought, ok, I know big ladies aren’t a lot of people’s cup of tea but I feel very comfortable with myself and let’s give it a go.' Within the first 24 hours, Verity realised that online dating as a larger woman meant she attracted some very odd characters. She said: 'I got quite a lot of interest, but once you start messaging, I realised that the majority of men just wanted a hook-up - they just wanted sex. 'Literally, within an hour of messaging they start asking what your favourite sexual position is, which is a bit disheartening. 'Also there were a huge amount of married men on there. In the past six months, Verity has been attracted by several strange men with fetishes on dating websites because of her weight . 'I had a guy who asked me if I wanted a cuckold relationship, which is when a man likes to watch his partner with other men. 'I also had someone ask me if I was interested in being his dominatrix. 'Nobody took it seriously, I even had one man who was a lorry driver who messaging me at 9pm at night, saying, ""I’m in Birmingham."" 'So I called his bluff and said, ""Oh yeah, shall I come and meet you now ?"" and he was like, ""yeah,"" I said, ""Get lost, it’s not a hook up site."" 'You start to think, ‘Ok, I’ve had enough of this, I’ve had enough of the sex requests,’ because you feel like no one is taking you seriously.' After becoming frustrated with her lack of success, Verity left Plenty Of Fish and signed up to Match.com. Verity never hid her size on dating websites, always stating that she is size 24, but men were still surprised at her body when they met up in person . But even more disappointing than the men with odd tastes and behaviour, were those who refused a second date because she was too big - even though she had made her size very clear. She said: 'It was at Plentyoffish.com when it started that I was told, I think you’re very beautiful and funny, you’re very witty and intelligent but you’re just a bit too big, you’re not a size 12. 'But then I moved to Match.com and it just got worse. 'I think it was because I made a point of saying, ‘You do know I’m a size 24?’ but people say, ""Well you don’t look that big in your pictures,"" so that’s a bit disheartening. 'I have had a few nice dates, but it never gets past the first one. 'I genuinely feel it’s because of my weight - men do not like fat women. 'He’ll say, ‘You’re really lovely but you’re too big,’ I’m not hiding my size before the date at all though, so it is really frustrating.' As a last resort, she signed up to a plus size dating website, but that brought with it a whole new range of strange men who were specifically attracted to larger women and a size 24, Verity found she was almost too small for many. Verity believes that our society will never be able to stop judging overweight people . She said: 'I do understand that although I am large myself, I wouldn’t necessarily want to go out with a man who was really, really obese, so I can understand where some guys are coming from. 'But then when I went on the plus size dating website, I’m not big enough for some of these people - they’d say things like, ‘Don’t go losing any more weight.’ 'Then there was this guy who was a feeder, he didn’t use that term, but he would ask me things like what I had eaten that day and if I was hungry, it was just weird. There was also a man who started talking to me quite explicitly and wanted to watch me poo. I was like, what?! 'And then there were lots of American men, which is all very flattering when you have lots of American men interested, but they are about eight or nine hours away. Although she had no luck on the online dating front in Britain, Verity attracted several admirers from America . 'Although I appreciate that people do have long distance relationships, that is just too far.' Last year, Verity won the Miss Plus Size International 2013 beauty pageant, so says she has had buckets of confidence about her appearance, but she says her online dating experience has really knocked her confidence. She has now sworn off these websites until she has lost weight, because she can't face any more rejection based on her size. Verity is now attempting to lose more weight so that men can finally see past her figure to the personality underneath . She said: 'I’ve got to the point where I don’t know if I can be bothered, I am not even considering dating now until I have lost some weight because I’m fed up of hearing that I’m not good enough. A lot of people turn around and say that I’m lovely and really funny, etc, but unfortunately it’s not enough. 'I’d love to have a relationship, but unfortunately my weight is putting men off. 'I think to myself that I have won a plus size beauty competition, so I can’t be that bad. 'Also, I was married until we got divorced seven years ago and I was in another relationship until January of this year, so  I know that some men can see past the weight. 'Unfortunately, as a society we’re always going to have this perception of fat people at the end of the day. 'People will always think that if you’re fat then you’re lazy, you sit around all day and eat cake and don’t work. 'Well I’m quite the opposite, but as an individual, if I want to have a relationship it's clear that I have to lose weight because that’s what is putting men off. 'I know there are some men out there who don’t mind big women, but my experiences since spring onwards have been extremely negative. 'You need to look at the bigger picture and the person inside.'

"A 12-year-old boy from Benton County, Washington, shot dead his 16-year-old sister before turning the gun on himself in what police are now calling a murder-suicide. Kaitlin Austin, 16, and Ethan Austin, 12, were discovered dead in June in their home on West 3rd Street in Hansen Park. The coroner’s office has determined that the sister died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head and torso, while her younger brother died from a single self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Shocking scene: The children's father returned to their house in Hansen Park in June and came upon Ethan and Kaitlin's bodies in a bedroom . According to the medical examiner, there was no evidence that another person was involved in the shootings. Drew Austin, Ethan's biological father and Kaitlin’s stepfather, came home at around 5pm on June 9 and made the grisly discovery. One of his registered guns was found near the bodies. On Friday, investigators released new details about the killings, shedding some light on the family tragedy, but there is still no word on a possible motive. Scott Johnson, an attorney hired by the Austin family, told the Tri-City Herald that everything appeared normal on the day of the murder-suicide. The weapon used in the killing was a handgun owned by Drew Austin. The firearm had been locked in a safe, to which Ethan had access. The 12-year-old was a Boy Scout and an avid hunter who was allowed to handle weapons when supervised by adults. According to his Facebook page, he bagged himself a deer last fall. Johnson said Ethan was not suffering from any mental health problems and was not taking any medications. Toxicology test results showed that drugs and alcohol played no role in the incident. The lawyer added that there was no indication that there had been animosity between the brother and sister.

"Chicago and Boston Marathon winner Rita Jeptoo failed a September doping test, her agent revealed Friday. Federico Rosa said that the 33-year-old  Kenyan tested positive for a banned substance in a test in Kenya before she won the Chicago Marathon in October. Rosa said Jeptoo's 'A' sample tested positive and that they were now waiting for testing on a 'B' sample. Reaction: Rita Jeptoo, 33, tested positive for a banned substance back in September, her agent revealed Friday . Rosa said he learned of the failed test 'a few days ago' and did not name the substance that showed up in the test. 'We will legally go after the person or the people that convinced Rita to do this,' Rosa said, saying that her management had 'nothing to do with' the doping. 'I am sorry for Rita,' Rosa said. Jeptoo won back-to-back titles in both the Chicago and Boston Marathons, setting a course record in April in Boston. Doping tests at the time came back negative. She also currently leads the World Marathon Majors, a championship-style competition across multiple cities. The series announced the postponement of the awards ceremony, scheduled for Sunday, because of the positive test. Champion: Jeptoo set a course record at the Boston Marathon in April 2014, but tests then returned negative . 'No athlete can win the World Marathon Majors Series title who has been in breach of IAAF anti-doping rules,' a series official asserted. The International Association of Athletics Federations released a statement that it was 'not in position where it can confirm or deny' the results of the test. 'The case remains in the confidentiality phase,' the IAAF said, 'although that should be lifted within the next week.' A report detailing Kenya's issues with doping was released earlier this month that found athletes in several sports have been found to be using banned substances.","The 33-year-old Kenyan distance runner tested positive in a test conducted in September, her agent confirmed .

"Australian scientists believe a seed from a rainforest plant could hold the key to curing cancer. Researchers say initial tests of the Blushwood tree has found is was effective 70 per cent of the time. An experimental drug based on the seed was even found to be effective in treating pets with cancer. The new drug, EBC-46, is a compound extracted from the fruit of the Blushwood tree which is found in north Queensland rainforests. EBC-46 is a compound extracted from the fruit of the Blushwood. The tree which is found in north Queensland rainforests. Scientists at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute found a single injection of the drug EBC-46 led to rapid breakdown of tumours in a range of human tumour models. The study, published in the journal PLOS One, was led by Dr Glen Boyle. He says the findings suggest the drug could be effective in human patients. 'We were able to achieve very strong results injecting EBC-46 directly into melanoma models, as well as cancers of the head, neck and colon,' Dr Boyle said. 'In most cases the single injection treatment caused the loss of viability of cancer cells within four hours, and ultimately destroyed the tumours.' Dr Boyle says EBC-46 works in part by triggering a cellular response which effectively cuts off the blood supply to the tumour. 'In more than 70 per cent of pre-clinical cases, the response and cure was long-term and enduring, with very little relapse over a period of 12 months.' EBC-46 is a compound extracted from the fruit of the Blushwood tree which is found in north Queensland rainforests. EBC-46 was discovered by the Queensland biotechnology company EcoBiotics.

The experimental drug has been used by practising veterinarians to successfully destroy or shrink tumours in pets – including dogs, cats and horses. QBiotics is currently undertaking formal veterinary clinical trials with EBC-46 in Australia and the USA. A final regulatory approval is still required for a human Phase I clinical trial. Dr Boyle says QIMR Berghofer is keen to pursue further research to determine if EBC-46 could be made more effective. 'We must stress at this point that EBC-46 will only be trialled in the short-term for tumours which can be accessed by direct injection or topical application,' Dr Boyle said. 'There is no evidence to suggest EBC-46 would be effective against metastatic cancers.' The pre-clinical trials at QIMR Berghofer have been largely funded by QBiotics with additional support from the NHMRC.","Fruit from the Blushwood tree caused tumours to break down in 70% of cases .

"David Cameron suffered a fresh set back in his bid to curb EU immigration today – after new Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker said freedom of movement should be made easier. Mr Juncker, who became European Commission president despite the fierce objections of Mr Cameron, told one of his new commissioners to 'promote freedom of movement' within the EU. The revelation comes as new polls suggests the public would vote to stay in the EU – even if Mr Cameron on manages to secure 'modest' changes to Brussels rules. David Cameron has pledged to curb European immigration as part of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with Brussels . If Mr Cameron in unable to win any changes in Britain's relationship with the EU the public will vote to leave according to a new poll . If the PM could not secure any renegotiation at all, people say they will vote to leave the EU by 42 per cent to 36 per cent. If Mr Cameron manages to secure 'substantial' changes people say they would vote to stay in by 55 per cent to 23 per cent. But if he can only get 'modest renegotiation' a majority of the public say they would still vote to remain in the EU, by 44 per cent to 36 per cent. The polling gives Mr Cameron hope that even small reform to European immigration rules could be enough to win public backing to stay in the EU. Mr Cameron has pledged to hold an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership by 2017 if he wins the general election. He is set to outline plans to limit the number of European migrants joining the workforce within the next few weeks, according to Government sources – and is considering an 'emergency brake' that could be applied if numbers of incomers exceeded forecasts. Jean-Claude Juncker was voted in as the new European Commission president in Strasbourg today . Mr Juncker spoke with Ukip leader Nigel Farage today after arriving to attend the presentation of the college of Commissioners . The Ukip leader congratulated Mr Juncker as his new team of 27 commissioners was approved - despite Mr Farage and other eurosceptic MEPs voting against him . Further curbs on low-skilled EU migrants' rights to benefits, tax credits and national insurance numbers could also be introduced. Outgoing European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso insisted over the weekend that an arbitrary cap on EU immigration would be incompatible with EU law. Mr Juncker's call for EU migration to be made even easier is a further blow to the Prime Minister. In a letter sent last month, Mr Juncker told Ms Thyssen, a Belgian MEP, that she should be 'improving the conditions for geographic and professional mobility across Europe'. He cited the EU-wide job exchange website EURES. Today's row comes after Mr Cameron was urged by veteran Europhile Tory Ken Clarke to ignore backbenchers using the public 'hysteria' over immigration to drive Britain out of Europe. The former Chancellor suggested the Prime Minister should let right wing MPs defect to Ukip so the party could get back to 'common sense'. He said: 'We mustn't compete with ignorance and bigotry,' Tory peer Lord Hill will be the EU's commissioner for financial services, overseeing banking - a post welcomed by the UK government . Mr Clarke's remarks come amid growing demands for the PM to demand a cap on the number of EU migrants allowed to move to the UK. The new European Commission led by Mr Juncker was voted in by MEPs today. MEPs voted 423 to 209 - with 67 abstentions - to allow the Commission to take office next month. The Commission drafts EU laws, oversees national budgets and enforces EU rules. Most Tory MEPs abstained from the vote. Other Eurosceptics, including Ukip, opposed the Commission, as did the Greens. But the main party blocs voted for the new team. The 28-strong team has one official from each EU nation. The UK's Lord Hill will be commissioner for financial services, overseeing banking - a post welcomed by the UK government. However, he had a rough ride in the hearings, as MEPs recalled him for a second round of questioning.","Jean-Claude Juncker said freedom of movement should be made easier .

"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . These stunning photographs of blood-soaked polar bears feasting on a dead walrus show exactly why they are such fearsome predators. After a three-day long meal on the carcass, their white fur and black snout are covered with blood and spattered with gore. Photographer Franco Banfi, 56, watched in awe for three days in July as a trio of polar bears feasted on the walrus in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic.

"Pensioners who live in expensive homes but don’t have enough money to pay a new ‘mansion tax’ will have their estates raised for the money after they die, Nick Clegg said today. The Deputy Prime Minister said he had ‘a lot of sympathy’ with people who did not have very much money but had seen the value of their homes soar after buying it years ago. But he said they would still have to stump up the cash owed under a new system to tax home worth more than £2million a year. Mr Clegg wants to introduce extra council tax bands to force families in expensive homes to pay more money every year to help pay down the deficit. The Labour Party has adopted the same policy – but has vowed to use the £1.5billion a year to hire tens of thousands of extra NHS staff. But David Cameron has blocked the proposal over concerns it will hit ‘asset rich, cash poor’ pensioners if large homes. Mr Clegg, speaking this morning in Glasgow at the Lib Dem conference, insisted that pensioners living in expensive homes did not need to worry. He said: ‘They don’t need to pay it up front. They can pay it as part of their estate. ‘I have a lot of sympathy for someone who says, “Hang on a minute I bought my house 30 years ago I don’t have a big income but I’m now a multi-millionaire in terms of my property”. ‘All we’re saying is the council tax due in the council tax bands that we will introduce will be due, that’s normal. Everyone accepts you have to pay the council tax.’ Mr Clegg said the Tories were not prepared to tax the wealthy at all to reduce the deficit. He said: ‘We’re saying that if you live in a property worth two million quid or more you should be paying council tax bands just as much as anyone on lower price properties. ‘I am sold on the idea that if you have council tax applied to people on bands to people on lower price properties why on earth don’t we have the same approach to higher price properties? We think it will raise around £1.5billion. ‘At the moment you’ve got this astonishing situation where a family home in Lewisham would pay the same in council tax as Russian oligarchs in a £10million mansion.’ Thousands of London pensioners face mansion tax bills from next year because the value of their homes have soared above the proposed £2million threshold . Mr Clegg added: ‘What I think you have to answer for people who don’t want to do this and this is another extraordinary example by the way – the Conservatives have said to me they don’t want to ask Russian oligarchs in 10 million quid houses to pay an extra single penny in contributions towards dealing with the deficit. ‘They don’t want to ask people like Alan Sugar – very wealthy retired pensioners to give up their TV licenses ort their winter fuel payments to help younger people who are trying to get a job – but they will ask the working age poor to cough up more money. ‘That is what is disingenuous about their position because we’ve always funded our fair tax cuts – by raising the point at which you start paying income tax - by asking the wealthiest in society to make a contribution. The Conservatives are now saying that if they were in government they would give with one hand and take with the other.’","Lib Dems want  extra council tax bands on homes worth more than £2million .

"'I want to grieve': Louise Troh, 54, was trapped in confinement when she learned her fiance Thomas Eric Duncan had died of Ebola on October 8 . The fiancée of Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan will be released from quarantine at midnight tonight - but will emerged with hardly any possession after they were destroyed by hazmat teams. Louise Troh, 54, missed her boyfriend's funeral while she was locked away for the duration of the deadly virus's 21-day incubation period, which expires tonight. During the frantic operation to seal off Duncan's apartment in Dallas and eliminate all traces of the disease, she also lost the majority of her belongings. Only a few personal documents, some photographs, and a single Bible escaped the cleansing operation. Speaking on Friday of her desperation to leave the quarantine - enforced by armed guards - she said: 'I want to breathe, I want to really grieve, I want privacy with my family.' Her pastor George Mason said he is also coordinating efforts with the city, county and philanthropic community to help Troh and the family recover. 'They were left with nothing. They are completely devastated by this, so there's need to have their lives rebuilt,' Mason said. Troh has also said she plans to repair some of the huge emotional and financial damage by writing a book about her relationship with Duncan, whom she met at a refugee camp on the Ivory Coast. Troh, a Liberian like her fiancé, will also recount his story, including his years-long quest to come to America to be reunited with his girlfriend and their 19-year-old son, and his death in an isolation ward. Devastated: Troh plans to write a novel about her life with Duncan (pictured), whom she planned to marry . 'It will be a love story,' she said. Describing her ordeal, she said: 'My beloved fiancé, Thomas Eric Duncan, who was also the father of my son, Karsiah Eric Duncan, did not survive with us. 'We continue to mourn his loss and grieve the circumstances that led to his death, just at the time we thought we were facing a happy future together. 'Our hearts also go out to the two brave women who have been infected by this terrible disease as they were trying to help him. 'We are also aware of how much this has affected many other people of my city, Dallas, and my country, the United States of America, even as it has in the country of my birth, Liberia. 'We also know that many people who work in Presbyterian Hospital are hurting because of this tragedy. We pray that God will bring healing to all in our community soon.' Duncan arrived in Dallas from Liberia in late September and went to the hospital complaining of headache and stomach pain. He was sent home with a prescription for antibiotics to treat a misdiagnosed sinus infection. He returned two days later, was diagnosed with Ebola and died on October 8. Troh was told of his death while she was in confinement. The day Duncan tested positive for Ebola, Troh, her 13-year-old son, Duncan's nephew and a family friend were ordered by a Dallas court to stay inside the apartment among Duncan's used linens and any lingering virus. Mourning: Duncan's mother Garteh Korkoryah, center, weeps at a memorial service in Salisbury, North Carolina . Destruction: The family is still devastated by Duncan's misdiagnosis. He was initially told his Ebola was sinusitis . The unusual confinement order was imposed after the family failed to comply with a request not to leave the apartment, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said. The four were later taken to an undisclosed gated community. The other people who will have their quarantine period end at midnight include Youngor Jallah, Troh's daughter, a nurse's assistant who checked Duncan's vital signs before calling for an ambulance. For nearly three weeks, Jallah has not left the cramped, second-story apartment she shares with her partner, Aaron Yah, their three children, ages 2, 4 and 6, and Yah's 10-year-old son. Unlike Troh, Jallah is not prevented from leaving by an armed guard, but Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have come by daily to check everyone's temperature. Also released: Youngor Jallah (left), Troh's daughter, and her partner Aaron Yah (right) will also be released at midnight . 'I'm telling you, just to step outside will be so great. To hug my mom and grieve for Eric, not over the phone like we've been doing but in the flesh,' Jallah said. At Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas on Sunday, associate pastor Mark Wingfield said the congregation was eager to welcome Troh back. 'We look forward to welcoming Louise and her family members back to church after the quarantine is lifted and we want you to know that when that happens we will be glad to receive each one of them,' he said.

"They say politics is a rough old trade – but Boris Johnson may have taken it too far today after sending a nine-year-old stumbling to the floor in a friendly football kick-about. The London Mayor joined in a children's match to promote a new health report aiming to get more kids involved in sport. But after seeing one youngster knock the ball past him Mr Johnson stuck his leg out, tripping him up, sparking shouts of 'Referee!' from the side-lines. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson . joined children for a kick around today after his health advisor Lord Darzi called for further bans on smoking in public places . After showing little enthusiasm for the game, Mr Johnson stuck his right foot out and tripped the boy up . Mr Johnson later issued an apology and insisted he was 'going for the ball' Mr Johnson was supposed to be promoting the health benefits of playing sport. But he instead had to issue a public apology for his behaviour on the football field, set up outside City Hall near Tower Bridge in London. Wearing his suit and moving slowly across the grass, he stuck his right foot in for the tackle and sent the youngster flying. He told Sky News: 'That was a total mistake. I apologise very much. I was going for the ball.' Mr Johnson has a history of reckless fouls on the football pitch after infamously leaving an opposition player sprawled on the floor after tacking him in a charity game – with his head. The London Mayor – who was then the MP for Henley – was taking part in a charity England-versus-Germany match in front of 15,000 people at the Madejski stadium in Reading in 2006. With eight minutes to go he accidentally passed to German No 6, Maurizio Gaudino – before attempting a rugby-style tackle to retrieve the ball. After the final whistle, Mr Johnson, gripping a can of lager, said: 'There was no malice in my actions. I was going for the ball with my head, which I understand is a legitimate move.' He added: 'To be honest, I'm a rugby player. I was always getting penalised for fouling when I played football.'

Mr Johnson's latest football indiscretion comes after he was forced to dismiss calls for a ban on smoking in public parks - after the Mayor's top health advisor called for the dramatic measure to be introduced. Lord Darzi said the capital should follow New York's example by banning smoking in Trafalgar Square, Parliament Square and the Royal Parks in a bid to reduce the 8,400 annual early deaths among London smokers. But Mr Johnson today said he has refused to act on the call for a ban - despite former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg crediting the policy as having boosted life expectancy by nearly three years. Claiming there was a lack of clinical evidence in the NHS to justify a ban, he said: 'There are many other proposals in this report that I think involve less bossiness, less nannying, less finger-wagging than telling people they can't smoke in a vast open space. 'I think smoking is a scourge and people should be discouraged from smoking, but actively to ban people from doing something that is legal in a big open space is taking bossiness too far.' Boris Johnson, right, tackles German's Maurizio Gaudino during a charity match at the Madjeski stadium in Reading in 2006 . The England versus Germany charity game was organised to raise money for The British Red Cross and the Bobby Moore Fund . Dame Tessa earlier told the Standard she would act if elected to City Hall in 2016. 'If you are asking somebody of Ara Darzi's eminence and reputation to conduct an investigation like this, you have got to have a pretty good reason for not accepting it if you want to improve the health of Londoners,' she said. 'The recommendations are all grounded in evidence and have public support - 59 per cent are in favour of a ban. 'Lord Darzi has looked at the very radical proposals that Mayor Bloomberg introduced in New York. These have been tried and tested. Similar protections should be offered to Londoners. 'If I were Mayor of London, promoting the health of Londoners would be one of the key areas I would want to act on.'","London Mayor joined in a children's match to promote a new health report .

"Lone agent: WWII MI5 agent 'Jack King' is today unmasked as humble bank clerk Eric Roberts . A lone MI5 agent who neutralised hundreds of Nazis during the Second World War is today unmasked as a modest suburban bank clerk whose civilian bosses had considered him nothing ‘special’. The ‘genius’ undercover operative managed to infiltrate and control Nazi sympathisers living in England – preventing them from passing intelligence to Berlin. Information he prevented ever reaching Hitler’s henchmen included the need for a ‘renewed Blitz, with more bomb damage aimed at undermining public morale’. Until today, the agent had been known only by his pseudonym, Jack King. But Security Service files reveal his real identity was Eric Arthur Roberts, a father-of-two from Epsom. Born in 1907 and educated in Penzance, he spent 15 years working for Westminster Bank without managers noticing anything remarkable about his skills. Indeed, senior staff expressed surprise when the Security Service requested Roberts’ release in 1940. Assistant controller RW Jones wrote: ‘What we would like to know here is – what are the particular and especial qualifications of Mr Roberts – which we have not been able to perceive?’ In fact, he had been identified by Maxwell Knight – MI5’s top agent runner – as a potentially huge asset. One MI5 officer described Roberts as ‘thoroughly familiar with everything connected with the various pro-Nazi organisations in this country’. According to his personal record sheet, he had only a ‘slight’ knowledge of German, although he had twice visited the country on holidays in the 1930s. He had, however, somehow acquired a knowledge of the pro-Nazi groups operating in Britain in the period before the outbreak of the Second World War – although how he came to do so is not disclosed in the documents. He was also a ju-jitsu enthusiast – having been a member of the Anglo Japanese Judo Club – which may have proved handy for a secret agent. Upon being liberated from the bank’s Euston Road branch in London, Roberts was deployed to infiltrate groups of traitors by security chiefs alarmed at the strength of support for Hitler in some parts of England. By posing as an undercover Gestapo officer, Roberts was able to control groups of ‘Fifth Columnists’ who were trying to aid the Fascist cause. Mr Roberts was picked out by MI5, which spent much of the war headquartered in Blenheim Palace (above) The Nazi sympathisers believed they were successfully passing secrets to Berlin – but all the while the information was being handed straight to MI5. By the end of the war, Roberts had monitored and controlled the activities of hundreds of would-be traitors. The Nazi sympathisers, based mainly in London and the south of England, used messages written in invisible ink and other ruses to pass details of Home Guard operations and intelligence on jet propulsion and radar systems. Had the network not been penetrated, it could have done significant harm, MI5 said. The traitors were never prosecuted, to avoid blowing future operations, and went to their graves believing they had helped Hitler. The files contain numerous accounts of King’s meetings with Nazi sympathisers, including one from April 1943 with three women who were discussing a recent German air raid. He wrote: ‘A nearby school clinic was hit and Nancy Brown said with a grin that one expectant mother was killed, two girls badly injured, a clerk and two children killed. ‘I looked in vain at the faces of these three women for signs of contrition. Nancy Brown looked a fine, healthy specimen of an Englishwoman, but it was obvious the deaths of these people meant absolutely nothing to her.’ Some of ‘Jack King’s’ exploits first came to light in February, when an initial batch of MI5 papers relating to his courage were declassified. The files do not disclose what happened to Roberts after the war. Are you a relative of Eric Roberts, or do you know what happened to him after the war?

"Equalities minister Jo Swinson said women should not feel pressurised by their bosses to freeze their eggs . Women should not feel pressurised into delaying having children by their bosses, equalities minister Jo Swinson warned today after it emerged firms were offering to pay to freeze employees eggs. Facebook and Apple are offering the extraordinary perk to female staff to encourage them to focus on their careers before having children later in life. But Miss Swinson said women needed to have 'genuine choices' about when to start a family and employers must not try to dictate their personal decisions. Preserving eggs has been described as a key to 'levelling the playing field' in the male-dominated tech industry. Reports from the United States suggest Facebook is paying female employees up to $20,000 dollars (£12,500) to cover the costs of freezing and storing their eggs, and Apple will start a similar scheme in January. The controversial debate reached the House of Commons today, when Labour backbencher . Geraint Davies accused the firms of institutional sexism and 'intimidating women'. He claimed the firms were essentially telling female staff: 'If you want to get to board level, you should have frozen your eggs.' He added: 'Isn't this the worst case of institutional sexism intimidating women into not having babies at a time of their own choice, and will you unequivocally condemn them?' Miss Swinson, a mother-of-one who took maternity leave from her ministerial job this year, replied: 'Well, it's up to individual companies on what policies they want to offer and whether indeed employees think that's any kind of incentive or otherwise. 'I think what is important is making sure there are genuine choices that women can make and that therefore women in the workplace do not feel under any kind of pressure to delay starting a family if that is in fact what they want to do at a particular point in their career. 'And the Government's changes to make much more modern the procedures around maternity leave and shared parental leave are absolutely essentially to making sure women and men can make the choices that work for them around parenting.' Scroll down for video . Payout: Women working for Facebook can receive £12,500 a time for freezing their eggs so they work longer . Bank: The eggs will be put in deep freeze so women can continue their careers, the technology giants said . The fact that two of Silicon Valley's biggest companies are introducing the initiative is no coincidence. Tech giants are fighting for talented staff in what has become known as the 'perk arms race'. Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, in particular, is known for her pro-women stance. The social media firm gives new parents £3,000 in so-called 'baby cash' to spend however they like. Both firms also offer generous wellness-orientated benefits to staff. Critics say the move is simply a ploy to persuade women to stay with the company. An Apple source indicated the company had no plans to extend the policy to the firm's UK workforce. An Apple spokesman in the US said: 'We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families.'","Silicon Valley giants willing to pay £12,500 a time to put eggs on ice .

"Crumbling in a heap in the middle of a field, these giant dishes once stood as a key defence during the Cold War. The RAF Stenigot was one of 20 vital relay centres which enabled NATO commanders communicate across the globe as relations the Soviet Union disappeared behind an Iron Curtain and the threat of nuclear war grew. But now the giant parabolic dishes have been allowed to fall into disrepair in a farmer's field in rural Lincolnshire - a distant relic of the clash between East and West. Crumbling: The giant dishes which helped NATO commanders communicate during the Cold War are crumbling in a field in Lincolnshire . Defence: RAF Stenigot had been strategically crucial since the outbreak of World War II . RAF Stenigot had been of vital strategic importance during World War II. The base had been part of a series of radar antennae called the Chain Home radar network. This provided long range early warning for raids from Luftflotte V and the northern elements of Luftflotte II along the approaches to Sheffield and Nottingham and the central midlands. These early warning systems used radar . waves to detect enemy German planes within 30 miles - allowing British . fighters to be scrambled in time to intercept them. But years after the end of the war, the site was upgraded, the large antennae dismantled and replaced by the giant 60-ft-wide parabolic dishes were installed as a massive upgrade. Relic: RAF Stenigot is one of the last two intact towers of 20 original sites dotted across the British Isles . Cold War: The giant 60-foot-wide metal dishes went on to be used for Cold War spying against Russia during the 1950's . For the next three decades, RAF Steniot become a key link in a communications network used by NATO during the . height of the Cold War. Bradford student Jonathan Tattersall, 22, travelled to the Lincolnshire field to report on this giant piece of wartime history. 'I first saw the dishes on urban exploring site and I had to go for a look myself' he said. 'It . was really interesting after reading about what the site was for, and . then turning up and looking at the scale of these dishes and imagining . what the site would have looked like a few decades ago. Fortress Britain: RAF Stenigot had been part of the Chain Home radar network but was later used in a NATO communication system during the Cold War .

Even though most of the site was demolished in 1996, the cost of removing the dishes was thought to be too much, meaning they still lie in the field today. Mr Tattersall said: 'Before describing what they are they are to those who haven’t seen the RAF base before, people are often bemused and fascinated by them. 'If you aren’t aware of the RAF history, you simply don’t know that these amazing dishes exist.'","RAF Stenigot was part of a vital early warning system during World War II .

"Australia's iconic brands such as Four'N Twenty, Vegemite and even the humble Anzac biscuit are coming under fierce attack on social media for producing Muslim-friendly halal-certified versions of their products. The Facebook page 'Boycott Halal in Australia' has been set up and aims to 'boycott all companies and organisations that promote or use halal products and services.' The page has  20,000 followers who claim that they will 'not buy halal products & services, because they fund Islamic expansion by any means'. Four'N Twenty and the Byron Bay Cookie Company's Anzac biscuits are the latest to come under attack for introducing a halal certified range of foods. Vegemite and Milo have also come under social media attack for producing halal versions. Scroll down for video . The much-love Australian iconic food brand Four N Twenty has sparked an outrage through social media over its' 'Halal certified' range . The official Four'N Twenty Facebook page is being bombarded with complaints for producing halal meat pies and sausage rolls. The number of complaints about their new halal foods has increased in recent months. Four'N Twenty has even been forced to respond individually to some of the Facebook attacks. The Australian pie company has said: 'Halal certified products are a small part of our range and are clearly labelled to ensure everyone can make an informed decision about which Four'N Twenty product is right for them.' Among the consumers declaring they will boycott the company, a few have voiced their support for their decision to introduce halal products. However, the overwhelming majority of Facebook users have been attacking the company's decision to sell halal products. One Perth user posted: 'I believe your company has bowed to Islamic pressure and now pay for your products to be halal certified...is this correct? If so, I will not be buying any of your companies products ever again!' Vegemite is among one of the Australian companies being targeted on social media for stocking Halal certified products . Byron Bay Cookie Company's Anzac biscuits is the latest to come under attack for introducing a halal range . Milo consumers take to the official Facebook page to post against the halal certified products, while Milo has even taken to responding to some comments . Another wrote: 'You say less than 5% of your products are halal certified ..so does that make it ok that you're selling out to Islamic crap rot ..you are still supporting it an the cruelty to animals ..you have lost another customer an i will be letting all know what you have done ...not on ....' One angry buyer even said the family would stop buying Four'N Twenty because it was selling halal certified products. The Four'N Twenty 'Export' Sausage Roll and Meat Pie are certified Halal by the Australian Federation of Islamic Council. The attacks on the Four'N Twenty halal range come despite the fact they are only being sold at specialty stores and produced for export. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Four'N Twenty for comment. Meanwhile, the Northern Star reports the Byron Bay Cookie Company is seeking legal advice after consumers took to their official Facebook page to attack them for their halal Anzac biscuit range. One Facebook user posted 'What a disgrace, the thousands of Anzacs that died on the beaches at Gallipoli will be turning in their graves.' Another posted: 'No Byron Bay anything for me either. I stand firm on boycotting anything Halal. No food should be about religion. No law should be about religion.' Disappointed consumers have expressed their anger over the halal certified range of Four N Twenty foods . Byron Bay Cookie Company is seeking legal advice after consumers took to their official Facebook page to post their disappointment over the company's halal Anzac biscuits . Facebook users have even accused Four N Twenty of supporting terrorism because they have launched a halal range of products . A spokesman from the Australian Food & Grocery Council told Daily Mail Australia that many Australian food manufacturers seek halal certification so their products can be enjoyed by Muslims and non-Muslims. 'In the same way that food labelled as vegan or gluten-free is suitable for consumption by a broad range of consumers, halal certified foods are commonly enjoyed by non-Muslims,' he said. 'Manufacturers pay for certification as a professional service, much like Kosher or organic accreditation, for example. 'Organisations who offer Halal certification services are subject to the same prohibitions on funding illegal entities and activity as any other organisation or individual under Australian law.' Even Vegemite has come under attack for stocking halal certified products . Despite the negative complaints, many  customers have expressed their support for the range on Four'N Twenty's Facebook page: . One user posted: 'Going to have a pie party with my next pay check. What a bunch of legends!' Another one wrote: 'Good onya Four N Twenty, for ignoring the ignorant bigots. Will go out of my way to buy your products now. You're awesome' And another wrote: 'It makes sense to have your pies certified Halal, same as you would have them certified ""Kosher"" or ""Heart Foundation"" or ""Gluten Free"". Such a sensible idea. Australians need to know what they're eating. As long as your pies are still delicious, you have my support. And my custom.' Despite the negative complaints, many others are showing their support for the halal certified Aussie meat pies . One user stood up for the range, and said 'boycott and you're the ones who'll miss out on a good ol' Aussie pie' Another user wrote: 'Thank you for being a great Australian company! I love your pies...' One user wrote: 'Good on you for responding so calmly to all the bigots posting negative things...' Another user wrote: 'Just wanted to say, this Aussie family will now look specifically for your halal products'","Australian companies are being targeted for producing halal products .

"Jailed: Osaro Osaigbovo laundered almost £200,000 for a gang which tricked people on dating sites . An aide to a gang of confidence tricksters who conned victims from around the world on dating websites has been jailed for three years. Businessman Osaro Osaigbovo, 39, laundered almost £200,000 for the gang, whose members posed as lovestruck singletons on websites including Match.com and Adult Friend Finder. One 59-year-old Belgian victim was swindled out of more than £320,000 in the belief he was helping a young artist called Chloe Elsevier living in County Durham, the court heard. He continued sending funds despite being warned by police it could be a trick - and even sent the gang a copy of the police's letter. The man only realised he had been conned when he read an article in The Northern Echo about the newspaper’s investigation into the gang. In another case, a woman from Florida was duped out of nearly £25,000 by a man claiming he was a neurosurgeon in Los Angeles who needed to sort out the affairs of his dead business partner. Members of Osaigbovo’s family fell to the floor in shock and screamed as he was led away to the cells. Southwark Crown Court heard Osaigbovo, of Dartford, Kent, was not one of the confidence tricksters but his financial help made him a key part of the operation. The businessman came to Britain with 'big dreams' and gained a master’s degree in human resources from the University of Hertfordshire, before becoming a ‘substantial contributor’ to the God Worshippers Ministry in Hackney, east London. The court heard he laundered almost £194,000 and received £45,641.78 from the scam, which was carried out between 2010 and 2011. He denied the offences but was found guilty of entering into a money laundering arrangement and three counts of acquiring criminal property. The jury did, however, find him not guilty of a second count of money laundering and seven counts of acquiring criminal property. His sister-in-law, Telma Asemota, 30, was acquitted of entering into a money laundering arrangement and five counts of acquiring criminal property. Danny Robinson, prosecuting, said 'the effect that the frauds had upon their victims’ was clear. ‘These were particularly mean offences committed upon those looking for love and relationships over the internet,' he said. Opportunity: One of the sites used by the gang was Match.com, the court heard. Recorder Christopher Morris-Coole said such cons are 'gathering momentum through the use of internet dating agencies' worldwide . Social network: Another website used by the gang was Adult Friend Finder, pictured. One man lost £320,000 . ‘Mr Osaigbovo was in this together with others - that’s how this case was put to the jury.’ David Smith, defending, said Osaigbovo lives with five family members, including two sisters-in-law, and came to the UK with ‘big dreams’. He had recently been offered a role as a human resources assistant after leaving a cleaning job. The judge, Mr Recorder Christopher Morris-Coole, told Osaigbovo: ‘This was an iniquitous trick that seems to be gathering momentum through the use of internet dating agencies throughout the world. ‘In this case there was clear evidence that persons had joined up with internet dating organisations and through that they had entered into regular communications with certain persons. ‘These persons were frauds and pretended to be totally different people to who they were. Osaigbovo’s family members fell to the floor and screamed as he was jailed at Southwark Crown Court . ‘The actual stories given to the subscribers were subtle and developed over time in order to gain their confidence. ‘The victims were vulnerable people seeking friendship and long-term security, putting their trust and faith in these tricksters who appeared genuine to them. ‘Your role was not the original confidence trickster, but it is clear from the evidence that you became engaged in the money laundering process at a very early stage. ‘I am approaching sentencing on the basis that you were the money launderer, and therefore you were not the ultimate beneficiary. ‘I am not prepared to accept what was said that you were simply performing these acts as favours. ‘Your behaviour in this case was so serious that only a custodial sentence is appropriate.’","Osaro Osaigbovo, 39, jailed for three years for helping confidence tricksters .

"Corrie McGuire was targeted because of her accent as anti-capitalist protestors brought chaos to the streets of central London last night . A London woman has told how she was attacked by an anti-capitalist protestor 'because of her accent'. Comedy agent Corrie McGuire was forced to walk through central London when violent demonstrations by activists closed down Parliament Square and Whitehall. Many of the protestors wore the mask of Guy Fawkes, made popular by the film V for Vendetta and taken up by radical groups. But as Ms McGuire tried to cross Westminster Bridge, she was targeted by a masked man who picked her out because of the way she spoke. Ms McGuire, 31, wrote on Twitter: 'For the first time in 10 yrs of living in London I was assaulted, apparently in the name of ""anti capitalism"". 'Just some pushing and shoving. Heavy police presence so one stepped in v quickly. Just a bit scary when they're in masks. 'I'm sure they're not representative but it was appalling to see. Apparently my accent isn’t in line with current campaign. 'Police incredible but faced with hundreds of masked people being v violent. Not the London I know.' She later told the Evening Standard: 'The person turned to me saying ""it’s alright for you, not all of us have mummies and daddies to look after us,"" and then he lunged at me. 'I can only assume it was because of my accent that he targeted me. What was terrifying is they were all wearing masks.' There were scenes of chaos in the capital last night as demonstrators attacked police lines during so-called Bonfire Night protests. Officers were forced to draw their batons as missiles, plastic cones and road signs were launched along the Mall, while fireworks were left off in Trafalgar Square. The masked demonstrators - some as young as 14 - also kicked and dragged over security railings while chanting 'one solution, revolution', as others daubed graffiti on riot vans. Scroll down for videos . Ms McGuire told of the assault on Twitter after she was confronted by a masked man on Westminster Bridge . Barricades erected in anticipation of the protest were lifted by demonstrators as police attempted to control scenes in Parliament Square . The crowd tried its best to carry out the wishes of the organisers, which asked for a massive blockade of London City . Demonstrators kicked and dragged over security railings while chanting 'one solution, revolution' A police officer ducks to avoid the pushing and shoving which surged through the crowd during the protest . During the march, protesters also let off fireworks and threw firecrackers at police who were guarding the Victoria Memorial, hurling abuse at them. The crowd surged through central London, pushing over bins, shouting at bemused shoppers and commuters and hitting cars and people with yellow flexible tubes. At one point, they surrounded a man driving a new Mercedes car and sprayed the back of it with an aerosol, pushing their tubes at him as he opened windows to remonstrate with them. The protest, known as the Million Mask March, was one of hundreds organised at the same time in cities around the world. Demonstrators wearing sinister Guy Fawkes masks - made famous in the film V for Vendetta - descended on Trafalgar Square, waving banners and placards, before marching towards Parliament Square at 6.30pm. Officers were forced to draw their batons as missiles, plastic cones and road signs were launched . Russell Brand took part in a protest outside Parliament which was orchestrated by activists who said they intend to cause chaos throughout London . The protest, organised in hundreds of cities around the world, saw the activists wear masks depicting the sinister face of Guy Fawkes - a mask made famous in the film V for Vendetta . As they milled around the square, they chanted anti-establishment slogans before climbing on to the base of Nelson's Column and letting off fireworks. They then moved onto Buckingham Palace before hundreds of protesters made their way through central London, going to Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street and Oxford Circus. They then marched to the BBC's headquarters at Broadcasting House on nearby Portland Place and going along Oxford Street to Hyde Park and Park Lane. As of around midnight, ten people had been arrested, including three on suspicion of assaulting police officers, one of a firework offence, three for public order crimes and one of attempted GBH. The group said in its manifesto that it fights against mass surveillance, austerity and infringement of human rights. British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood was also spotted at the march in central London , at which comedian Russell Brand donned a Guy Fawkes mask . Police arrested a man on suspicion of headbutting a woman police officer outside Buckingham Palace during the protest . Officers were forced to draw their batons as missiles, plastic cones and road signs were launched along the Mall . The heightened security measures come as the Metropolitan Police attempted to contact Anonymous, but no one came forward with any details . Protesters argued with riot police as they formed human barriers against the huge crowd of demonstrators . Riot police were put on high alert after warnings from the protest group that it would cause chaos in London . Russell Brand also joined the London arm of the worldwide Million Mask March last year. During that march, energy bills were burned, fireworks were shot at Buckingham Palace and there were 15 arrests, following scuffles with police. He later wrote an article saying that riots are sparked 'when dialogue fails, when they feel unrepresented and bored by the illusion'. Today, it seemed the group were hoping for a similar result. On its website before the march, one of the group members wrote: 'What I'd like to see is a MASSIVE Anonymous blockade of London City. 'Complete physical GRIDLOCK. Only thing that gets through are Fire & Rescue and ambulances. NOTHING ELSE MOVES.' Fireworks and smoke were seen rising out of Trafalgar Square as the protest got underway last night . The group - which uses the Guy Fawkes masks as its trademark - said it fights against mass surveillance, austerity and infringement of human rights . The protest was held on the night of Britain's Guy Fawkes Night, and many of the marchers wore the white masks of the man who plotted to blow up parliament in 1605 . Protesters chanted anti-establishment slogans as they milled around, while others climbed on to the base of Nelson's Column let off fireworks . The group also warned it would have 'bigger banners, louder voices, more people and a louder system'. The London march is part of a day of global demonstrations, which include rallies across Europe, the Americas and Asia. The protest has led to officers from the Metropolitan Police, British Transport Police and the City of London Police Force being on stand-by. The heightened security measures came as the Metropolitan Police attempted to contact Anonymous, but no one came forward with any details. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said they had attempted to contact organisers of the event 'without success'. Graffiti was daubed on a police van, while a masked protester stood nearby waving a placard . Most people protested peacefully, but some ten arrests were made, Metropolitan Police said . The group warned it would have 'bigger banners, louder voices, more people and a louder system' than last year's protest . Writing on its website before the march, the group said: 'What I'd like to see is a MASSIVE Anonymous blockade of London City'. Protesters waved banners and placards during the march . The protesters came up with a number of creative ways to express their messages of discontent . The group said in its manifesto that it fights again mass surveillance, austerity and infringement of human rights . Anti-capitalist protesters held up signs saying 'Expect Us' 'We Are Anonymous' and 'We Are Everyone' Rather than communicate directly with local authorities, Anonymous sent a message to the government . The protesters made their way through central London, going to Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street and Oxford Circus . And it added that they have imposed Section 60AA of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 across Westminster between 5pm today and 2am tomorrow, which provides powers to remove masks when police fear a crime will be committed. Scotland Yard said: 'The Met Police deals with around 4,500 protests and events every year. These can range from a single protester to hundreds of thousands of people walking through the capital's streets. 'Officers work with organisers to ensure that people are able to carry out their right to peaceful protest whilst ensuring Londoners can go about their daily business.' Last year’s London march saw more than 2,500 protesters take to the streets, in a rally which saw fireworks thrown at Buckingham Palace and a total of 15 arrests. Rather than communicate directly with local authorities, Anonymous sent a message to the government, and to global world leaders: 'To oppressive governments, we say this: we do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail against the angry masses of the body politic.'","Comedy agent assaulted  'because she spoke the wrong way'

"Only one in five Australian men would say they are at the happiest and healthiest point in their lives, according to new research. The study done by the Movember Foundation also found men were at their mental best between the ages of 30 and 34, and their worst between the ages of 45 and 49. The release of this new research coincides with Mental Health Week, which started on Sunday and ends on Saturday. Two-time world surfing champion Tom Carroll suffered from low-level depression . Movember Foundation Asia Pacific director Jeremy Macvean said the results indicated more needed to be done to change the attitudes of men towards mental health. The study surveyed more than 1,500 Australian men from the age of 18 and up. A person who has experienced the struggles of admitting that he suffered depression is two-time world surfing champion Tom Carroll who denied he had the mental illness for a number of years before he sought help. The Australian - who won the World Championship Tour in 1983 and 1984 - said his 'low level' depression was only realised after he became addicted to amphetamines. 'Drugs lifted me up. It really helped me get up and engage with the world and that's what I treated myself with for many years until it stopped working,' Carroll told Daily Mail Australia. 'I only truly recognised it [my depression] probably around the age of 45 years old.' The Movember Foundation research found only one in five Australian men felt like they were at their happiest point in life . Carrol (pictured here in 2004) urged people to seek help as early as possible for their mental health issues . Carroll urged men to talk about their mental health concerns. He said they usually found it hard to talk about mental issues because talking about feelings went against the tradtional male stereotype . 'I think men have get this strong message when they're young that they have to be in control and be fearless,' he said. 'How we talk is quite foreign – the idea of talking about how we're feeling, it doesn't make quite much sense to us yet.' Carroll encouraged those who were feeling 'disconnected' from the world to talk about it and address mental health issues sooner rather than later. 'Those things you don't want to talk about, it will grow, that's what my experience has taught me,' he said. 'They don't go away, they just fester and grow and when you bring the light onto it, it starts to diminish. 'It might be slow or it might quick, but it will diminish [if you talk about it].' Most importantly, Carroll said the best way to recover from mental illness was not to go through it alone. The release of the research coincides with Mental Health Week and comes before the launch of Movember on November 1 . 'Depression can trap us within ourselves and disconnect us from outside world and separates us completely...in some cases, it can be very hard to dig out of,' he said. 'Start dialogue with someone you feel comfortable with, the people you often care about are the ones to start that off with. 'It's important to talk about how you are going with someone and work through it. Sometimes it is a slow process but depression can really change your body chemistry.' Despite men's mental health becoming a more talked about issue, Movember Foundation Asia Pacific director Jeremy Macvean said the results of the study highlighted there was still a long way to go. Men were more likely to turn to Google than talk to their peers to find out more about mental health issues, and would rather talk to their doctors over their partners to about their problems. Meanwhile, 56 per cent of men surveyed said they would prefer to talk politics with their friends compared to the 28 per cent who would talk about their mental health concerns. 'Five times as many guys do nothing at all about a mental health concern versus a physical one,' Mr Mcvean said. 'We want every man across the country to take their health more seriously - mental as well as physical.' The research found one in four men would wait several months before to seek advice when it came to mental health, whereas 86 per cent who would take steps to put right a physical issue in just a matter of weeks. Mr Mcvean also urged the public to take part in Movember to help raise awareness and funds for prostate and testicular cancers, and mental health problems as 75 per cent of men did not know the symptoms of the cancers and 50 per cent were not familiar with the signs of depression.

"Telling your children they are pretty or handsome hardly seems like bad parenting. But from today, the Government will urge mothers and fathers not to praise their children for their looks or their size – or to talk about their own weight worries. Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone has launched a 12-page guide aimed at tackling youngsters’ body hang-ups. It warns parents that comments about weight and body shape, as well as airbrushed images of celebrities, are damaging children’s self-esteem. Touched up: The actual image taken of Keira Knightley, left, was noticeably enhanced by the time it was used in the promotional material for the 2004 film King Arthur . changes: The guide shows how images of pop singer Britney Spears have been altered . A series of practical tips for ‘promoting a healthy body image’ urges parents to look at magazines and TV adverts with their children and point out where images are likely to have been digitally enhanced. They are also told to refrain from praising prettiness or thinness, comparing youngsters to celebrities or teasing them about their weight. In further advice, which is likely to trigger claims of fuelling the nanny state, the online guide advises parents to ‘try not to complain about parts of your body you don’t like’. ‘Although it is difficult to feel confident about your body all the time, by appearing to be neutral or positive about your own appearance, you will be helping your child to develop their own body confidence,’ the pack says. The guide also warns that youngsters – particularly girls – risk developing low self-esteem and possible mental health problems if they believe that touched-up images of models and celebrities are real. It features before-and-after shots of celebrities including Britney Spears, Keira Knightley and Jonathan Rhys Meyers to show how airbrushing and other techniques can significantly change their appearance. Warning: The guide quotes a study by Girl Guiding UK which found that 75 per cent of 11 to 21-year-old girls go on diets to look more attractive . Warning against teasing or highlighting physical features, the guide says: ‘Even seemingly friendly nicknames can be hurtful if they focus on some aspect of the child’s appearance.’ But parents shouldn’t ‘feel scared to praise the physical attributes that make your child unique, whether they are tall, short, narrow or wide’. If a child complains ‘I’m fat’, parents should ‘discuss body diversity and how the beauty ideals they may be relating to lack diversity’. 'Bright and bubbly': Fiona Geraghty, 14, was found hanged in her home last year . Mrs Featherstone, a mother of two, . developed the guide in conjunction with Media Smart, a non-profit media . literacy programme for six to 11-year-olds. The . guide quotes a study by Girl Guiding UK which found that 75 per cent of . 11 to 21-year-old girls go on diets to look more attractive. Its launch comes only days after a coroner blamed the fashion industry and its obsession with ‘wafer thin’ models for the death of a ‘bright and bubbly’ 14-year-old public schoolgirl. Fiona Geraghty was found hanged in her home last year after suffering from bulimia. Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, held the fashion industry ‘directly responsible’. ‘I ask for magazines in the fashion industry to stop publishing photographs of wafer thin girls. For their vanity, families like this suffer,’ he said. The guide describes how modern technology has enabled advertisers to create ‘unrealistic’ images, using airbrushing to make skin look clear and flawless, and to make models appear thinner.’ Unless they are aware of those techniques, they will set themselves ‘unrealistic and unattainable goals of beauty,’ it adds. Mrs Featherstone said: ‘Young people are being set an impossible standard by images in media and advertising which can erode their self esteem. ‘As parents, we are often aware of these issues, but may not have the advice and guidance we need to talk to our children. ‘I want the pack to empower parents to have those difficult conversations.’ Worries: Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone has launched a 12-page guide aimed at tackling youngsters' body hang-ups, using pictures of celebrities such as Jonathan Rhys Meyers .","Government will urge parents not to praise their children for their looks or their size .

"Warnings have been issued about a 'catastrophic' security flaw affecting one of the most important interfaces powering the web. Known as the 'Bash' bug, the flaw could be 'bigger than Heartbleed' which put every computer user at risk earlier this year. Experts claim the bug may pose a serious threat to computers using Unix-based operating systems including Linux and Apple's Mac OS X - and in turn, could spread to all internet-connected devices. Errata security researcher Robert Graham tweeted (pictured) an example of how the bug can be exploited, and how code can be added, to websites on Macs running OSX. He warned that Bash is 'probably a bigger deal than Heartbleed' because it could threaten the security of millions of websites . The bug makes all Apple Mac computers, around half of all websites and most internet connected home appliances vulnerable. The danger is that it can run in the background, without a user ever knowing. And once it does, a hacker will be able to take control of your device. For instance, the bug could be used to read or send emails, copy banking data, turn on a webcam or listen in on a computer's microphone. Essentially, this means if your computer will do something without asking for a password, then someone using the bug can also do the same. Anyone using these devices will need to include a 'patch' update to the software as soon as it is released. As well as computers, the public is being warned they may need to update their internet-connected devices, such as smart locks, separately. Bash is the software used to control the command prompt on many Unix computers, and the bug can exploit it to take complete control of a system. Linux is used in everything from cars to cameras, as well as the Raspberry Pi, and the bug could also affect Android, Windows and IBM machines. ‘The impact is very severe, it’s not overstating it to say it’s a more serious bug than Heartbleed,’ Professor Tim Watson, Director of the Cyber at Warwick University told MailOnline. ‘The primary way this is going to be exploited is through the web… a hacker can use the bug to put malicious things on the website or to steal information, like banking details.’ The bug, which also goes by the name 'Shellshock', could potentially allow hackers to gain access to every internet-enabled device in a person's home using something as innocuous as a smart lightbulb. The danger with this, in particular, is that once it has access to an internet-connected device it can jump onto others. This includes smart locks that open front doors. Errata security researcher Robert Graham tweeted an example of how the bug can be exploited, and how code can be added, to websites on Macs running OSX. By comparison, 'Heartbleed' - dubbed a 'critical security flaw' at the time - only allowed hackers to spy on computers, not take control of them. Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell. It is what's called a command-line shell that lets users control software programs and features. Commands are sent to these programs by typing text into a particular area of code. This code is typically restricted to programmers, but the Bash bug leaves it open to attack from anyone . Bash does not require users to rush change their passwords, but it does provide another way for hackers to take control of computers and devices. 'The method of exploiting this issue is also far simpler. You can just cut and paste a line of code and get good results,' according to Dan Guido, chief executive of a cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits. Its potential to disrupt Apple Mac computers, which uses the Bash software, is of particular concern, experts warned. Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell. It is what's called a command-line shell that lets users control software programs and features. Commands are sent to these programs by typing text into a particular area of code. This area is typically restricted to programmers and website owners, but the Bash bug leaves it open to attack from anyone. For example, Mac OS X users can run it by from their Terminal, as can people running devices on the Linux operating system. Windows is not affected in the same way, but if a hacker exploits malicious code through the flaw, they could gain access to any device, in theory, including PCs. The bug is said to have existed for 25 years, and was discovered by Linux expert Stéphane Chazelas. As an example, the Apache web server runs Bash in the background to carry out tasks, including processing personal data entered into online form. A hacker who exploits Bash could send a request for the information, and then add malicious code to the server to send the user to other sites, or to install a virus on their computer. Once the hacker has access, they could launch an attack on every visitor that users the site - and users could be none the wiser. According to experts, there haven't been any reports of real-word attacks, but that doesn't mean they won't ever be affected, nor does it mean they haven't happened in the past, without being detected. Reports are suggesting Apple has patched the flaw that explicitly affects the terminal on its Mac software, but the firm has not officially confirmed this. The responsibility to fix the flaw lies with the website owners, meaning everyday users can't do anything to protect themselves. Website owners, especially running on Linux-based servers, are being told to check and patch their systems immediately. The Heartbleed flaw in Open SSL encryption affected millions of sites earlier this year. By comparison, Heartbleed only allowed hackers to spy on computers; not take control of them . The only solution is to update every device that is vulnerable with a patch. And this can only be done by website or server owners. Tod Beardsley, an engineering manager at cybersecurity firm Rapid7, warned the bug was rated a '10' for severity, meaning it has maximum impact. He also rated it 'low' for complexity of exploitation, meaning it is relatively easy for hackers to launch attacks. 'Using this vulnerability, attackers can potentially take over the operating system, access confidential information, make changes, et cetera,' Mr Beardsley said. 'Anybody with systems using Bash needs to deploy the patch immediately.' ‘While antivirus software and firewalls are the basic line of defence for most organisations, they’re not going to be able to stop the attackers getting in this way,’ said Ross Brewer, vice president at Log Rhythm. US-CERT advised computer users to obtain operating systems updates from software makers. It said that Linux providers including Red Hat had already prepared them, but it did not mention an update for OS X. Apple representatives could not be reached. Tavis Ormandy, a Google security researcher, said via Twitter that the patches seemed 'incomplete.' However, Mr Ormandy could not be reached to elaborate, but several security experts said a brief technical comment provided on Twitter raised concerns. The bug could allow hackers to gain access to every internet-enabled device in a person's home.The danger with this is that once it has access to a internet-connected device it can jump onto others in the home. This includes smart locks, such as the August lock (pictured), that open front doors remotely . Unlike Heartbleed, which only affected a specific version of OpenSSL, the Bash bug has been around for a long time. 'That means there are lots of old devices on the network vulnerable to this bug,' said Robert Graham, of security firm Errata. 'The number of systems needing to be patched, but which won't be, is much larger than Heartbleed.' The Heartbleed bug allowed hackers to spy on millions of computers all over the world. Bash, however, allows hackers to read information, edit, delete or copy files, and run programmes. All of this can take place without the user knowing. Unlike Heartbleed, which forced users to change their passwords, Bash doesn't have an easy fix. It will largely be up to system administrators and software companies to issue patches. 'That means some systems could be exploited even though they are patched,' said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer with security software maker Veracode. He said corporate security teams had spent the day combing their networks to find vulnerable machines and patch them, and they would likely be taking other precautions to mitigate the potential for attacks in case the patches proved ineffective. 'Everybody is scrambling to patch all of their Internet-facing Linux machines. That is what we did at Veracode today,' he said. 'It could take a long time to get that done for very large organisations with complex networks.' 'Heartbleed,' discovered in April, is a bug in an open-source encryption software called OpenSSL. The bug put the data of millions of people at risk as OpenSSL is used in about two-thirds of all websites. It also forced dozens of technology companies to issue security patches for hundreds of products that use OpenSSL. Bash is a shell, or command prompt software, produced by the non-profit Free Software Foundation. Officials at that group could not be reached for comment.","Bug poses a threat to devices using Unix-based operating systems .

"It was one of the most star-studded weddings of the year  and since tying the knot to George Clooney in a three-day wedding extravaganza, Amal Alamuddin has secured her status as one of the world's favourite style icons. And now, one artist has celebrated Mrs Clooney's wardrobe in a rather bizarre way - by immortalising her as a Simpson. The Lebanese-born lawyer, who has shot from relative obscurity to most envied woman in the world overnight, wowed with a wedding wardrobe packed with the likes of Oscar de la Renta, Dolce and Gabbana and Prada, which Italian Alexsandro Palombo has captured in a series of illustrations. Scroll down for video . Guess who? Amal Alamuddin and George Clooney have been treated to a Simpson makeover by an Italian artist to celebrate their recent wedding . As you know them: AleXsandro Palombo, a contemporary artist, illustrator and activist has 'Simpsonized' the couple to celebrate their wedding, pictured on Hello! magazine's cover last week . The contemporary artist, illustrator and activist has 'Simpsonized' the 36-year-old in a succession of her best-known outfits from the wedding weekend. The series includes her stunning selection of designer looks from Alexander McQueen,  Giambattista Valli and Stella McCartney. And, of course, she can be seen in her bespoke Oscar de la Renta for her marriage to Mr Clooney. All white! Amal looked chic in Stella McCartney  tailored, wide-leg trousers and a navy and cream top as she made her union to Mr Clooney official on Monday - and there she is rocking the look as a Simpson, right . Colourful creation: The lawyer wore a beautifully ornate Giambattista Valli Haute Couture minidress for her first appearance as Mrs Clooney on Sunday, which the Italian artist has re-imagined, right . The French lace gown was embroidered with diamante and pearls and featured a circular train, while the wide neckline scooped just off her shoulders. He has also included the look she wore the day after her wedding - £450 Stella McCartney tailored, wide-leg trousers and a navy and cream top, both of which were bespoke, of course. The day before she wore the weekend's most colourful creation - a Giambattista Valli Haute Couture minidress, which she wore for her first appearance as Mrs Clooney on Sunday, as seen in the quirky illustrations. At the glamorous pre-wedding dinner, she took a tip from British royalty and wore a custom-made dress by Alexander McQueen, the same designer that the Duchess of Cambridge wore for her actual wedding. Red hot! For her pre-wedding dinner, Amal wore custom-made Alexander McQueen, which also featured a high-low hemline . The eye-catching scarlet gown, which perfectly complemented Amal's dark hair and eyes, was adapted from a Resort 2011 collection design, which Michelle Obama wore to a state dinner in 2011. Alexsandro's previous work includes giving the Duchess of Cambridge a similar makeover and also recreating Disney princesses as disabled and as victims of domestic abuse on his blog Humor Chic. Speaking about Amal's wardrobe, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Amal is surely now the First Lady of Hollywood? She has got the high-profile hubby, has her own amazing career, will now of course be enlisted to help with charities and has the most incredible designer wardrobe. 'She has given us a glimpse of what to expect from her when dressing for occasions in the space of a few days: her monochrome Dolce & Gabbana arrival outfit demonstrates her ultra chic travelling wardrobe, the stand-out red McQueen dress was sexy eveningwear done to perfection, the post-wedding Giambattista Valli couture mini-dress shows how she does short and sassy, and the trouser-and-top combo for their civil ceremony was her answer to chic, well-tailored, classic dressing. 'Women will want her wardrobe, and they will try to emulate her looks. She's aspirational and has proven to be a style icon in the making, always wearing the clothes rather than them wearing her. She wears couture exactly as it's meant to be worn - fitted down to the last millimetre and with confidence.' Look who it is! The happy new Mr and Mrs Clooney can be seen in a romantic embrace on a boat named Amore as Homer drives them into the distance .","Lebanese-born lawyer, 36, wowed with designer outfits last weekend .

"Women who live near their mother are more likely to become mothers themselves. One reason is that relatives can provide help with looking after a young child, a study by University of Essex researchers shows. It also found that a mother's influence is a major pressure on women to have children. Women trying to get pregnant are more likely to succeed if they live near their mothers or other close relatives . The researchers believe that having . potential childcare close by helps a woman's psychological state, but . say even they were surprised by the strength of the link. They looked at a series of studies carried out on nearly 2,000 women where records were kept on their fertility but also their lifestyle, health and social status. This included questions about their relationship with their immediate family, their extended family and their networks of friends. Those women trying for a baby and getting pregnant more quickly tended to have their family nearby, not just for their first child but for subsequent children, too. Dr Paul Mathews from the University of Essex said: 'We were surprised that we actually found a significant effect. 'We thought that maybe there might be a relationship, but we were surprised that the relationship remained even after we controlled for a whole myriad of social and economic background factors. It's thought that having potential childcare close by boosts a woman's fertility as she feels psychologically calmer . 'Comparing two young women who have effectively the same income, education, religion, ethnicity, the young woman who is closer to her family still seems to find it significantly easier to have children. 'We know that having kin around is beneficial in terms of having children in high-fertility resource-poor populations, both in developing countries and in historical Europe. 'We were surprised that even in a very different setting, a modern technologically advanced society such as Britain, we still see the same pattern.' Economically, having 'free' childcare . from a relative seems important to would-be mums, particularly for . mothers of one child to go on and have a second one. Yet women may be fooling themselves . that this is the best option, said the researchers, for it could also be . preventing them from finding much better paid work in areas much . further away. Mumsnet Founder Justine Roberts said: 'The support of extended family is important to the wellbeing of mothers after they've given birth.'","Link remains when women are of same .

"By Stephen Gibbs for Daily Mail Australia and AAP . Corporal Chris Lunt undertook years of intensive training to ready himself for war in Afghanistan but says nothing could prepare him for the Kabul traffic. As one of a small team of Australian soldiers charged with transporting VIPs, military personnel and the occasional journalist across the city, Corporal Lunt has learnt the first rule of driving in Kabul is there are no rules. 'It is quite a thing to behold being out there and just seeing people walk across the streets and highways where you are travelling at 80-90 km/h,' the transport leader from Brisbane says. 'There are no road rules.' Private Tammy Grant drives an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser through the streets of Kabul. She faces the threat of suicide bombers and improvised explosive devices every time she gets behind the wheel. Driver Tammy Grant, from Townsville, faces close calls every day. 'People step out in front of you. Cars pull out in front of you from the opposite side of the highway, cars start reversing down the highway in front of you,' Private Grant says. Private Tammy Grant cleans the windows of the armoured Land Cruiser she uses to transport military personnel, VIPs and journalists through the chaotic streets of Kabul. As well as the constant chaos of third-world traffic is the daily threat of car bombs, insurgents on motorcycles attaching magnetic explosives to vehicles and other improvised explosive devices. Private Grant and her colleagues drive a small fleet of 200 Series Toyota Land Cruisers which have been modified with armour plating and improved suspension. The Land Cruisers are preferred to the otherwise highly-regarded 15-tonne Bushmaster vehicles because they are less obviously military and can be more easily navigated through the city's crowded streets. Constant road threat: Afghanistan's National Army soldiers stand guard at the site of a car bombing on the road to the presidential palace in Kabul. A soldier of Afghanistan's National Army inspects a destroyed vehicle at the site of an explosion on the road to the presidential palace in Kabul. Two Americans and one Polish soldier were killed on September 16 when an armoured Land Cruiser similar to that driven by the Australians was destroyed by a suicide car bomber who had driven around their vehicle and detonated an explosive device. That fatal explosion was captured by traffic cameras and Corporal Lunt has shown his team the footage to remind them of the dangers of their job. 'We can't be complacent,' he says. 'We are out there almost every day.' Best job: Despite the daily dangers, these Australian soldiers love their job driving armoured SUVs through the chaotic streets of Kabul. And despite all the risks, Corporal Lunt and his team love their work. 'This is probably the best job you can have in MEAO (Middle East Area of Operations),' he says.","Specialist army driving team transports VIPs across Kabul .

"This group of female horse riders are stripping off to raise funds for a good cause. Each one is involved in the equestrian world in some capacity; either hunting, show jumping, or into eventing or dressage. And the one-time models, who each represent a different month, have dressed up in lingerie for a racy horsey-themed calendar. Scroll down for video . The women from the equestrian world have stripped down to lingerie and each represent a different month . They've accessorised themselves with little other than strategically-placed riding props such as whips, caps and riding jackets. The women from the equestrian scene in Wiltshire, Somerset and Devon are all amateurs, and for most is the first time in front of a camera. The Foxy Hunters calender 2015, now in its sixth year, features black and white shots of the women and raises money for air ambulance services. One model, Laura Quick 31, of Honiton, Devon, competes in dressage and show jumping. She said: 'We certainly have a giggle during the shoots. Fun aside though the cause for the calendar is the real reason we all participate.' The Foxy Hunters Calendar was conceived by Photographer David Betteridge of DHB Photography in 2009. They've accessorised themselves with little other than strategically-placed props such as whips, caps and riding jackets . The women are all in the horsey world and are either hunters, show jumpers, or into eventing or dressage . Having photographed many equestrian events he became aware of the dangerous nature of the sport. The idea is to raise funds for the Wiltshire Air Ambulance, and the Hampshire and IOW Air Ambulance, which play such a vital role for local horse riders. When a friend's life was saved by the Hampshire and IOW Air Ambulance Crew following a riding accident the project became even more important and very personal and so it was decided that the funds raised also go to help their amazing work. Mr Betteridge said: 'My market is primarily online - I have orders from all around the world, we send them to New Zealand, to Australia and a lot to America and Canada. 'We have people that come through the Facebook group and offer to be in it, and they come from around the country, but most of the women in it are still locals from Wiltshire.' Last year he had to double the amount of calendars he printed. 'It started with just a couple of hundred likes on Facebook and now it has just rocketed - I often think I must be dreaming.' To date more than £26,000 has been raised to help keep the Air Ambulance Services flying. The calendar is available via the website foxyhunters.co.uk priced at £12.50 plus postage and packing.

"Lewis Foster, pictured today outside court, reversed into his mother while drunk . A teenage learner driver who accidentally reversed into his mother and killed her as she begged him not to drink drive was jailed for a year yesterday. Lewis Foster, 19, arrived home drunk after a row with work colleagues and got behind the wheel of his car, despite having no licence or insurance. Deborah Jones, 47, followed him to the Citroen Saxo she had bought for him for Christmas and begged him not to drive because it would ‘ruin everything’ if he was caught. But as he revved the engine, the car jerked backwards, crushing her against a fence post under the wheels, a court heard. Foster, who was 18 at the time, was later found to be nearly twice the drink drive limit. He admitted causing death by driving carelessly under the influence of alcohol and driving without insurance. She was killed by the horrific accident on July 12 last year, and devastated Lewis was found to be twice the legal drink drive limit. He admitted causing death by driving carelessly under the influence of alcohol and driving without insurance at a previous hearing. Foster, of St Austell, Cornwall, was yesterday jailed for a year in a young offenders' institute as Truro Crown Court heard he faced a 'lifetime of mental torture'. Judge David Ticehurst told him: 'The words tragic and tragedy are often misused these days but there is no escape of the fact that this is a tragic case with a tragic result for everyone involved. 'You, Lewis Foster, will carry the burden that you killed your mother by your careless driving for the rest of your life. 'Nothing that I say or do could add to the sense of guilt that you feel and that you will always feel. 'You were only 18 at the time the offence was committed, I take into account that it was a momentary lapse. Whether your foot slipped off the clutch does not matter a great deal. 'It was not a prolonged period of driving but it was reckless, completely thoughtless, without any regard to what may happen. 'Had you spent a moment or two . thinking about the situation, had you not been so drunk, had you not . been in a temper, you would not be here.' A view of the service lane behind Dobell Road in St Austell where Lewis Foster drove into his mother . Another view of the lane where the terrible accident happened in July last year . Dobell Road: Truro Crown Court had heard that Foster spent the afternoon before the accident drinking . The court heard Foster had been out drinking with work colleagues when he got into a drunken argument with his boss. His . mother, who was also a grandmother, had previously seen him in the pub . and the pair began arguing when he got back to their home. Mr . Lee said despite Foster not having passed his test, his mother had . given him enough money to buy the car as a Christmas present. On . the night of the accident he came to their home in Dobell Road, St . Austell, at around 9.20pm, grabbed the keys, told his mother he wanted . to leave the area, and hopped into the vehicle. Police shot of Lewis Foster, 19, after the accident . After locking himself in, he began . revving the engine, prompting his mother to move from the back of the . Saxo to the nearside rear corner, shouting: 'Lewis, stop - you'll ruin . everything.' As the car shot back she was crushed against a post before being pinned under the wheels, the court heard. Frantic efforts were made to save Mrs Jones as her son got out of the car and his friend tried to move the Citroen. Mrs Jones was rushed to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon, but died from her injuries the next morning. After his arrest Lewis failed a breath test, showing 64mg of alcohol - nearly twice the legal limit of 35mg. Philip Lee, prosecuting, said: 'It is apparent from the evidence that from time to time, mother and son argued and shouted at some times and there was anger between them. 'But it is also apparent that they did have a close and loving relationship.' Piers Norsworthy, defending, said any punishment dished out to Jones was insignificant in comparison to the 'lifetime of mental torture' he faced. He added: 'At the time of the incident this young man was in a very dark place - no rational thought would have gone through his mind. 'He is a decent young man who has not always had the best start in his life, but he certainly loved his mother very dearly as she did him.' Foster was jailed for 12 months and disqualified from driving for four years. At the time of Mrs Jones' death, the family released a sentence saying: 'Debbie was a lovely person, a great mum and grandmother. She will be dearly missed.' Mrs Jones's next door neighbour, Sarah Snell, aged 46, said she was shocked and saddened by the news. She said: 'She was a lovely person who would help anyone. If you needed her help she would be there. She was always looking out for me and my children.'","Lewis Foster ignored his mother's pleas not to drive and leapt into Citroen .

"An incredibly rare coin bearing the likeness of King Edward VIII which was made before he famously abdicated his throne has emerged for sale for £30,000. The 12-sided coin, worth just threepence when it was made, was an experimental piece produced by the Royal Mint after the death of King George V. Edward automatically succeeded his father but abdicated before his coronation so he could marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. One of only ten ever made: An incredibly rare coin bearing the head of King Edward VIII which was made before he famously abdicated has emerged for sale for £30,000 . Rare: The coin was made by the Royal Mint following the death of George V in January 1936 and before Prince Edward VIII abdicated his throne in December that year to marry Wallis Simpson, pictured together in 1937 . While commemorative Royal China was mass-produced to honour the new King, hardly any coins with his head on were created. The piece now for sale was one of no more than 10 brass pattern threepence coins produced by the Mint. The reverse has an emblem of a thrift plant and the date of 1937. Edward abdicated in December 1936 and was succeeded by his brother, King George VI. The coin has been owned by a private collector of historic British coins for the last 20 years and he has now decided to sell it at auction. Nigel Kirk, of Nottingham-based auctioneers Mellors and Kirk, said: 'Very few of these coins were made, possibly only about five or 10. Prince Edward was succeeded by his brother King George VI, pictured with Queen Elizabeth at a celebration for D-Day on June 8, 1946 . 'When Edward decided to abdicate all the makers of commemorative China had manufactured their wares. 'People who have pieces now think they are rare and valuable but they aren't. 'However the Royal Mint only experimented with coinage and hardly any of them crept into circulation in error. 'Edward was effectively King for a year and the Mint was a bit late in producing these coins, probably because they were experimenting with radical, art deco shapes like this one. 'This is coming from a private collector who has spent 25 years forming a large collection of English coins dating back to the 16th century. 'We have had quite a lot of interest in it. It would be the jewel in the crown to many coin collections.' The coin is due to be sold on Tuesday. Collectible: Edward, the Duke of Windsor, pictured with his wife Wallis in 1963, was effectively King for nearly a year before he abdicated.

"Doubles: Tracey Cannon with two fans of the dolls . When they appeared on Dragons’ Den to drum up investment in their range of lookalike children’s dolls, the verdict of the millionaire entrepreneurs was a humiliating ‘no’. Mother and son Tracey and Keiran Cannon were told in no uncertain terms that the business they had sunk their every penny into was ‘unviable’ – and were advised to quit. But now they have proved the BBC Dragons wrong, landing a £100,000 deal with toy store Hamleys. The pair were derided by all five tycoons when they sought investment for their £65 My Lookalike Doll – a 18in figure which children can customise to make ‘mini-me’ versions of themselves. Design guru Kelly Hoppen told them: ‘This is not a viable business I would want to put my money into.’ And mobile phone boss Peter Jones warned: ‘Do not spend another pound taking this forward.’ The pair, who wanted a £75,000 investment, left the den brokenhearted. Mrs Cannon, 45, said: ‘Going on Dragons’ Den was absolutely devastating – one of the most humiliating experiences of my life. But the rejection by the Dragons made both of us even more determined to succeed, whatever the odds.’ The order from Hamleys marks a reversal in the company’s fortunes – and could place My Lookalike Doll in the list of successful ideas rejected by the TV experts, including The Trunki suitcase, ‘cup-a-wine’ and Tangle Teezer. Mrs Cannon said: ‘Hamleys made an initial order of 100 dolls plus outfits which sold out. So this week they ordered 500 more – and told us they will need at least a further 500 dolls plus accessories by Christmas. The whole order is worth around £100,000 and they’re worried we won’t be able to make them fast enough.’ Mrs Cannon, from Glasgow, set up the company in 2011 after a visit to the States, where she bought a doll for her daughter, Khyra, now 11, which ‘looked so much like her’. Scroll down for video . Spooked: Design guru Dragon Kelly Hoppen was creeped out by her lookalike doll and hid it under her chair . The doll was such a hit with Khyra and her friends that Mrs Cannon decided to start the business with her son, now 23. She said: ‘I knew I was taking a gamble but I took redundancy from my lecturing job, putting the £20,000 pay-off into the business. A further £40,000 came from remortgaging the house, £20,000 from a bank loan and the rest was made up of savings. It amounted to £120,000 to make hundreds of dolls, matching clothes children can buy to wear themselves, plus storage.’ Sitting pretty: Rob Law, creator of the Trunki, sits on top of his invention at home in Bristol . She says she knew their appearance on the show in September last year, was doomed to failure as soon as they gave Ms Hoppen one of their dolls. ‘I’d had it specially made with curly hair like Kelly’s,’ she recalls, ‘but although Deborah Meaden seemed impressed with her lookalike, Kelly seemed terrified by hers and hid it under her chair.’ Worse was to come. ‘When Duncan Bannatyne said “it’s not going to be a great business”, my heart sank,’ she says. ‘At the time we were only selling three dolls a week. No one seemed interested that we were a brand-new start-up. They were quite rude.’ Ms Meaden was concerned no shop would have enough shelf space to show the 133 types of dolls, while internet tycoon Piers Linney agreed that the amount of stock would ‘keep me awake at night’. Mrs Cannon, married to engineer Allan, 47, said: ‘The Dragons made us look like fools. Although I realise their blunt comments made good TV, it was a crushing blow. But our passion for the dolls and belief the Dragons were wrong kept us going. And, to the Cannons’ surprise, shortly before the show was broadcast, Hamleys confirmed they were interested. ‘The buyer had no idea about Dragons’ Den,’ she added. ‘We are delighted that our toys are stocked in such an amazing shop.’","All five Dragons' Den tycoons rejected Tracey Cannon and son Keiran's idea .

"Baby Gammy and his mother have moved into a new house paid for using part of the $250,000 raised for his family through public donations. About half of the money raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, leaving $120,000 to cover 10-month-old Gammy's future medical and living expenses, said charity Hands Across The Water. Charity founder Peter Baines said the family needed a new home because their previous one-bedroom unit was too run-down for Gammy, who still suffers from a lung condition. Scroll down for video . Baby Gammy and his mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua moved into a new house, 100km south of Bangkok . Almost half of the $250,00 raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, where the pair will live with Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children . 'He was recently back in hospital for six days prior to them moving into house,' Mr Baines told Daily Mail Australia. 'We took advice from Down Syndrome Australia who said the environmental conditions of where the kids live are important. 'They're more susceptible to illness, colds, and virus than children who do not have Down syndrome so they need to live in a cleaner, healthier environment that's why we were keen to see them moved.' Earlier this year Goy and Gammy found themselves at the centre of an international row over the ethics and legality of surrogacy when it emerged Gammy's Australian parents David and Wendy Farnell abandoned him in Thailand but took home his healthy twin sister Pipah. Before moving into the new home Gammy was in hospital for six days due to a lung infection . Goy and Gammy pose with Nom Manochantr, general manager of Hands Across The Water in Thailand . Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of  Pipah, the West Australian reported. Pipah recently returned to Australia after a trip to China with Mrs Farnell for her mother's funeral. WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said officers have yet to make a decision about whether she can stay in the care of her father David Farnell, a convicted child sex offender. 'The department was fully aware of her travel and was supportive of her taking time to grieve and spend time with her family,' Ms Morton told the West Australian. 'While this specific case is still subject to an ongoing thorough assessment, I can assure you that much has happened behind the scenes.' The family needed a new home because their previous one-bedroom unit (pictured) was too run-down for Gammy, who still suffers from a lung condition .

The house for Gammy's family was purchased and is being held under a trust in the name of Hands Across The Water, which is managing the family's money on behalf of his Thai surrogate mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua. 'This way we guarantee the safety of the house so the family can't sell it or use it for any means that are inappropriate,' Mr Baines said. Gammy, Goy, and Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children moved into the home earlier this month. Mr Baines said Gammy was now much healthier and has gained a lot of weight. He added that the family plans to do some alterations at the front of the house to set up a noodle shop, similar to the one at the front of Goy's grandparents' house where Gammy sometimes stayed. Hands Across The Water founder Peter Baines visited the family earlier this month to assess their situation and needs. Pictured: Goy and her three children . Mr Baines described Gammy as: 'a strong little boy who certainly appears healthy and full of life' 'That's not out of necessity, because we're paying them more than enough in a monthly allowance,' he said. 'It's just a way for Goy to be productive and earn an income.' The house is in the same neighbourhood as the family's previous residence, in an industrial area about 100km south of Bangkok, where they also ran a small shop selling salads and noodles. Mr Baines said $250,000 was raised for Gammy through the Go Fund Me website, but the company took $10,000 in fees. 'We made approaches and asked if they could discount that and they said no,' he said. Three people, who wish to remain anonymous, originally set up the Go Fund Me page to raise $25,000 for Gammy. Media outlets picked up the details of that fund when the story started gaining worldwide media attention, and when the amount of money donated became too much for them to handle they asked Hands Across The Water took step in and manage it. Mr Baines said: 'we anticipate the original donated funds being sufficient to see Gammy into early adulthood' Earlier in the year, Hands Across The Water administered $20,000 towards Gammy's medical costs, including moving him from a public to a private hospital, when he was suffering from a lung infection .","Family move into new three-bedroom house paid for by public donations .

"The prime suspect in the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross was discovered hanged in dense woodland and was identified by his dental records, an inquest has heard. Convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns was found dead in Boston Manor Park, west London, on October 4 - just four days after the teenager's body was pulled from a river less than a mile away. A short hearing was held at West London Coroner's Court as the inquiry into the 41-year-old Latvian's death was opened and adjourned today. Scroll down for video . Schoolgirl Alice Gross (pictured, left) went missing in August and her body was discovered a month later. Prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns (right) was found hanged in Boston Manor Park, west London, a coroner  heard . Specialist teams recovered Zalkalns's body earlier this month after an extensive search of woodland . Coroner's officer Lana Atkinson told the court: 'A post mortem conducted on October 6 found a conditional cause of death is consistent with hanging. 'There is no evidence of third party involvement. Police are still investigating and he was identified by dental records.' Alice Gross was last seen on CCTV walking along the Grand Union Canal in Hanwell on August 28. Her body was found by London Fire Brigade divers just over a month later wrapped in a plastic bag and weighted down in the River Brent. Zalkalns was seen on video footage cycling along the same towpath minutes after Alice. He went missing from his home in Hanwell days later. Senior coroner Chinyere Inyama opened and adjourned the inquest until December during the brief hearing this morning. He said: 'On the facts of this case I'm satisfied I will be able to open an inquest. This inquest is now opened and adjourned to December 19. I await a full post mortem report.' Zalkalns served seven years in prison in his native country of Latvia for bludgeoning and stabbing his wife Rudite to death. Alice  was last seen  walking along the Grand Union Canal in Hanwell, west London on August 28 . Alice's disappearance  sparked one of the largest searches in the history of the Metropolitan Police . Flowers left at the Hanwell clock tower in memory of Alice Gross after her body was pulled from a river . The general labourer, who worked at a building site in Isleworth, west London, is believed to have come to the UK in 2007, but authorities here are thought to have had no record of his murder conviction. Alice's body was found wrapped and weighted down in a shallow stretch of river by London Fire Brigade divers on September 30. The schoolgirl from Hanwell was identified using dental records and a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive, a brief hearing in to her death heard earlier this month. Scotland Yard Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey has previously insisted that the investigation into Alice's murder is still live despite Zalkalns having been found dead. He also defended the amount of time that it took to find Alice and Zalkalns' bodies. Officers from 17 other police forces were drafted in to help with the search, including underwater experts from five forces and victim detection dogs and handlers from four outside the Met. The search was the largest operation that Scotland Yard has carried out since the aftermath of the July 7 bombings an  involved around 600 officers, including teams from 17 other forces.

"An Indiana man with 47 guns and stocks of ammunition was arrested after threatening to go into a local elementary school and 'kill as many people as he could before police could stop him'. Von Meyer, 60, was arrested on Friday after his wife called Cedar Lake police after he threatened to set her on fire and continue his violent spree by attacking a nearby elementary school. The loaded threat came the same day that a young man killed 20 children and seven others in Newtown, Connecticut. Arrested: Von Meyer, 60, was arrested after threatening to kill people at a nearby elementary school . When police arrived at Meyer's home, they found 47 guns and ammunition, the sum of which cost more than $100,000. 'Through investigation, police learned that Meyer reportedly had a large number of weapons hidden throughout the two story historical home,' the report states. The makes and models of the guns have not been released, but many of them were said to be historical collectors items. Meyer allegedly said that he was going to light his wife on fire once she fell asleep. His plan didn't end there, however, as he set his sights on the Jane Ball Elementary School which is less than 1,000 feet away from his home. The police report states that the school is easily accessed from Meyer's home by a series of trails and paths that cut through a wooded area. Officials at Jane Ball School were notified, and they immediately took unspecified security measures. Wooded area: Meyer lives in a home that is less than 1,000 feet away from an elementary school . Dangerously close: Meyer's house is extremely close to an elementary school, making his comments more threatening . The same happened at all local schools on Friday because of the threat, which was undoubtedly heightened as news rolled in of the shooting in Connecticut. Police arrested Meyer and he now faces four counts of felony intimidation, two counts of resisting law enforcement, and one count of domestic battery. Meyer was known to be a member of the Invaders Motorcycle Gang, though his role in the group was unclear. Like the notorious Hells Angels, the Invaders Motorcycle Gang is also considered an outlaw group. The Northern Indiana chapter was founded in 1965. He is being held without bail at the Lake County jail.","Von Meyer, 60, was arrested after making threats against school .
