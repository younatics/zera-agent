"(CNN)  -- Gael Monfils saved five match points before beating top seed Roger Federer 7-6 6-7 7-6 to reach the final of the Paris Masters on Saturday. The home hero will play Robin Soderling for the title after the Swede beat  another Frenchman, Michael Llodra, in an earlier pulsating encounter at the Bercy arena. It was truly the great escape for 12th seed Monfils, who was on the ropes as he served at 5-6 down in the deciding set, having broken back after dropping his service for the first time. The opening two sets were shared on tiebreaks. 16-time grand slam champion Federer proceeded to force a succession of match points, all saved by a mixture of dogged defense by his French opponent or uncustomary errors by the world number two. The partisan crowd breathed a collective sigh of relief when Monfils finally forced the third tiebreak of the match and claimed an early mini-break. Federer retrieved the loss but uncharacteristic forehand errors saw him fall behind again and when Monfils was presented with his first match point he seized it. He will now hope to go one better than 2009 when he was beaten in the final by Novak Djokovic. ""I went to the limits of myself,"" Monfils admitted after his first career victory over Federer. ""I feel better and better as the tournament goes on. I ran out of juice a little bit at the start of the third set but the fans were there, they pushed me and I kept believing."" Earlier, world number five Robin Soderling had to save three match points before ending the fairytale run of Llodra. He won 6-7 7-5 7-6 to reach his first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 final, but came under massive pressure in the 12th game of the third set. Like Monfils, Soderling staved off defeat to force a deciding tiebreak and secured victory on his second match point after two hours and 49 minutes of gripping action. ""Today it was a great match. It wasn't maybe pretty, but I'm here as a winner,"" Soderling told the official ATP Tour website. Llodra, who came back from a break down in the deciding set to set up his victory chances, had defeated defending champion Djokovic and Nikolay Davydenko on his way to his first Masters semifinal.","Gael Monfils to play Robin Soderling in the final of the Paris Masters .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Roger Federer reached the semifinals of the Paris Masters for the first time in his long and illustrious career with a straight-sets victory over Austria's Jurgen Melzer on Friday. The top seed in the absence of the injured Rafael Nadal, Federer had previously never made it past the last-eight stage -- where he was eliminated in 2002, 2003 and 2008. It is the second time he has beaten a frustrating run in the capital, having ended his long wait for a first French Open title on clay at Roland Garros last year. The Swiss star, a 16-time Grand Slam champion who has won 65 career titles, defeated 11th seed Melzer for the third time this season following straight-sets victories at Wimbledon and the US Open. The 29-year-old triumphed 6-1 7-6 (7-4) against the French Open semifinalist to set up a Saturday showdown with last year's losing finalist Gael Monfils, who upset world No. 4 Andy Murray in front of a jubilant home crowd in the late match. ""I thought I served well the whole match,"" Federer told the ATP website after firing 18 aces, his best in a two-set match. ""I think in the second he was able play a bit more solid overall, and I think he served a bit better. Top guys rarely just go through two sets not having a sniff at all. His sniff was in the breaker when he hit two good returns to go 2-1 in a mini-break, really."" French 12th seed Monfils lost the opening game to love but broke Murray on the Scot's next turn at serve before going on to seal a 6-2 2-6 6-3 victory. Monfils will be seeking to stop Federer's bid to win a third successive ATP event as he bids to emulate last year's feat, when he made it to the title match before losing to Novak Djokovic. The other semifinal of the indoor hardcourt tournament will be fought out by fourth seed Robin Soderling and dark horse Michael Llodra, who knocked out Djokovic on Thursday. Soderling saw off American eighth seed Andy Roddick, with the Swede winning 7-5 6-4 against a player he will line up with at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London later this month. He reached the last four at Paris-Bercy for the first time, having ended a run of two three-set defeats to Roddick in the U.S. earlier this year. ""I just didn't feel sharp - everything was very basic,"" Roddick told the ATP website. ""I played one good point, one bad point. The basics weren't there as much as they have been in the past couple of weeks, which is disappointing."" World No. 34 Llodra, France's fourth-ranked player, boosted his chances of being picked for next month's Davis Cup final against Serbia as he continued his dream run this week. The first unseeded semifinalist since 2007, the left-hander defeated Russian 10th seed and 2006 champion Nikolay Davydenko 7-5 6-1. The 30-year-old fought back from 4-2 down in the first set to win 11 of the next 13 games. ""I needed to play serve-and-volley because he was returning very well,"" Llodra said. ""I was very lucid on break-points. When I had opportunities, I tried to be aggressive. I think today it was more mental victory than a tennis victory.""","Roger Federer had previously lost all three of his quarterfinals at Paris Masters .

"London, England (CNN) -- The British government will compensate a number of British residents who were interned at Guantanamo Bay, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke announced Tuesday, saying he could not reveal the amount of compensation. ""The settlement is not to be taken as any admission of liability,"" he said, portraying it as a way of resolving lawsuits against the British government so that an independent inquiry into torture allegations could get started. ""It was not in the interest of any party to get stuck in litigation,"" Clarke told the House of Commons. ""It could have taken years, it could have cost tens of millions of pounds,"" he said. ""It was a difficult and unusual situation, but it was the right thing to do. I think we've saved public money."" The settlement will cover all British citizens and residents who were held at the U.S. military detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, as far as the British government is aware, Clarke said. At least six men had filed suit against the British government, seeking damages over human rights violations they say they suffered during their rendition to and detention at various locations, including Guantanamo Bay. The British government inquiry into the issue -- announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in July -- could not begin until the suits were settled, Clarke said. Police investigations will also have to be finished before the so-called Gibson inquiry can begin, he said. Amnesty International said that the British government isn't going far enough. ""Financial compensation can be an important part of the right to remedy and reparation for victims of grave human rights violations. However, it remains only one part,"" said Amnesty official Nicola Duckworth. The human rights group said lawyers acting for the British government have repeatedly sought to prevent disclosure of relevant material, and had argued for closed procedures allowing courts to consider secret material presented by U.K. authorities in closed sessions. And in the United States, the American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the British action while condeming Washington for not following suit. ""Here in the United States, the Obama administration continues to shield the architects of the torture program from civil liability,"" said Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the ACLU. ""If other democracies can compensate survivors and hold officials accountable for their endorsement of torture, surely we can do the same,"" he said.","NEW: Amnesty International and the ACLU demand more action and information .

"(CNN)  -- AC Milan missed the chance to leapfrog city rivals Inter at the summit of Serie A after being held to a 1-1 draw by Napoli in the San Siro on Sunday. A victory would have seen Milan go top for the first time this season but it was Napoli who went ahead after 13 minutes through Hugo Canpagnaro before Filippo Inzaghi headed the equalizer 13 minutes later. The draw sees Milan stay in second spot, one point behind champions Inter, who were held to a 1-1 draw at Palermo on Saturday. Third-placed Roma are three points adrift but meet Inter next Saturday in a decisive clash. Milan are bidding for their first Italian championship since 2004, but have lost David Beckham and Aleessandro Nesta to serious injuries in the past week. Milan coach Leonardo gambled on the fitness of Brazilian striker Pato, but he limped off shortly after Campagnaro had taken advantage of laughable home defending as Christian Abbiati and Massimo Oddo collided to leave him a simple chance. But Pato's fellow Brazilian Ronaldinho set up Inzaghi for a simple headed goal after a clever piece of play and fine cross. Napoli, who are still chasing a Champions League place, had chances to reclaim the lead and home keeper Abbiati had to show his mettle either side of the break. Milan also had opportunities in an entertaining game and Inzaghi and Mancini were denied by fine saves by Morgan De Sanctis. ""It's never easy playing Napoli. We had a few chances after the goal but it wasn't to be,"" Ronaldinho told AFP. ""There are ten games left to give it our all. We need to take the positives from the game and keep our feet on the ground. If we do, the scudetto is a real possibility. In other key results on Sunday, first-half strikes from Tommaso Rocchi and Sergio Floccari gave Lazio a 2-0 win at Cagliari, to boost their battle against relegation. Bari and Parma shared the spoils with a 1-1 draw to stay in mid-table with Chievo and Catania also ending 1-1. Sampdoria later completed a miserable week for Juventus with a 1-0 home win in the battle for the final Champions League spot. Juve, shocked by Fulham in the Europa League, were beaten by a superb long range strong from Antonio Cassano for Samp, who go fifth.","AC Milan held 1-1 at home by Europe-chasing Napoli to stay second in Serie A .

"(CNN) -- Roma blew the Italian title race wide open with a 2-1 victory at home to Inter Milan on Saturday that saw Claudio Ranieri's team close to within a point of the four-time defending champions. The capital club moved above AC Milan into second place after riding their luck against Inter, who hit the woodwork three times. A mistake by goalkeeper Julio Cesar gifted Daniele De Rossi a 17th-minute opener for the hosts, then Inter defender Walter Samuel headed against the bar just before halftime and fellow Argentine Diego Milito hit the corner of the goalframe soon after the interval. Jose Mourinho's team drew level in the 66th minute as Wesley Sneijder set up Milito despite Roma's claims for offside, but on-loan striker Luca Toni netted the winner six minutes later after a wayward shot by substitute Rodrigo Taddei dropped in his path. Milito was again left ruing a close miss as he hit the post deep into injury-time, sealing a frustrating defeat ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal first leg against CSKA Moscow. Roma are now unbeaten in 21 league games, a run which began with a 1-1 draw at Inter in November when Ranieri's side were 14 points adrift of the Nerazzuri. The result was satisfying for Ranieri, who was replaced by Mourinho at English club Chelsea in 2004. ""Now we face a battle of nerves in our remaining games and the real deal begins. We will not give up although Inter are still one point ahead of us,"" he told reporters . Third-placed AC Milan, who lost to Parma in midweek, can join Roma on 62 points with seven matches to play by beating Lazio on Sunday. Palermo moved four points clear of fifth-placed Sampdoria with a 3-1 victory at home to Bologna in Saturday's late match thanks to a hat-trick from striker Fabrizio Miccoli. Miccoli's 10th-minute opener was canceled out by Brazilian forward Adailton on 38, but the former Italy international put the Sicilians ahead at halftime from the penalty spot. The 30-year-old then sealed victory with 11 minutes to play.

"Ottawa, Canada (CNN) -- A Canadian air force colonel and pilot who was entrusted with flying Queen Elizabeth across Canada has pleaded guilty to charges of murder, rape and dozens of sexually motivated break-ins. Police say Col. Russell Williams confessed that he murdered two women, sexually assaulted two others, and broke into dozens of homes in search of women's lingerie. He was arrested in February after being pulled over at a police roadblock near the home of Jessica Lloyd, one of his murder victims. He pleaded guilty in an Ontario courtroom on Monday, sparing victims and their families weeks of gruesome testimony. The country is now bracing for victims' impact statements during the sentencing phase. Lurid details of how the colonel video-recorded and photographed his victims and saved this evidence as ""trophies"" are expected to be aired. A portrait of Williams as a merciless sexual predator is beginning to emerge. Many are wondering how a man trusted with the country's most sensitive military secrets could have, for so long, kept so many secrets of his own. ""Down deep it's still hard to believe it, that it's the same guy. But we've accepted it. It doesn't make any sense at all for those that knew him,"" said George White, a neighbor and friend of Williams for 14 years. ""I think there's two personalities there,"" added White, who said that the colonel kept many details of his life to himself but was always very friendly and a good companion. He described a man who was an avid fisherman and jogger, and someone who was the consummate professional at work. But White said that in hindsight it was strange that Williams never spoke of his family or his past. ""He was extremely secretive. We never knew anything about his family till after the fact. He never divulged anything. But that's all in hindsight, of course,"" he said in an interview with CNN. Williams divided his time between his home in Ottawa and a country cottage in southern Ontario, both of which he shared with his wife, Mary-Elizabeth Harriman. In legal evidence filed as part of a civil suit, Mary-Elizabeth Harriman said she had no idea of the crimes her husband had committed and described herself as being devastated by what she had learned. White said he took the time to write her on behalf of their mutual friends. ""I sent Mary-Elizabeth a letter, a letter on behalf of our small group that sat together every evening for coffee and that. I sent her a letter, explained that we were her friends, we were there to stand by her,"" he said. ""Never heard back from her."" No one seems to have had any idea that the colonel was leading a double life. For many, to try to figure out what could have triggered such a deadly spree of sexual attacks has been a nagging mystery. Most troubling for victims and their families is the great lengths police say Williams went to to preserve the video, pictures and mementos from his crimes. It seems to have been a consuming obsession for the highly decorated military commander. Police say dozens of these ""trophies,"" along with other souvenirs of his crimes, were hidden and even catalogued in his upscale Ottawa home. Despite his confession, Williams has so far given no indication as to what could have driven him to such bizarre and cruel behavior. Victims were subjected to hours of sexual torture and made to pose for video and photographs, usually while blindfolded and bound. ""Unanswered questions: How, why, when, where, everything,"" said White, who added that despite Williams' guilty plea, ""I'm sure we'll never know.""","Former Canadian air force colonel pleads guilty to murders and sexual assaults .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain each scored twice as Real Madrid beat city rivals Getafe 4-2 on Thursday to move back above Barcelona at the top of the Spanish Primera Liga table. Real Madrid's 10th successive league victory ensured Manuel Pellegrini's side move above Barcelona on goal difference, just 24 hours after the defending champions had gone top with a 2-0 win over Osasuna. Four goals in the opening 37 minutes set the visitors on their way, with Ronaldo opening the scoring in the 13th minute with a superb free-kick. Higuain made it 2-0 just seven minutes later after converting Rafael van der Vaart's pass and he added a third within three minutes after being put through by fellow-Argentine Fernando Gago. That goal was Higuain's 22nd of the season, equalling his tally for the whole of last season. And Ronaldo made it 4-0 for a rampant Real side in the 37th minute -- cutting inside from the right before thundering home a superb shot into the top corner. But Getafe refused to lie down and pulled a goal back almost immediately when former Madrid player Dani Parejo dispossessed goalkeeper Iker Casillas before firing into an empty net. And the home side added a second consolation goal with 10 minutes remaining when Pedro Leon slotted home after Javi Casquero's shot had deflected off Raul Albiol. Meanwhile, Juventus continue to struggle in Italy's Serie A and they slumped to another defeat on Thursday, 3-1 at Napoli -- who moved up to sixth place in the table, one ahead of Juve. The evening started well for Alberto Zaccheroni's side and they took an early lead when defender Giorgio Chiellini nodded home from close range. The home side missed a penalty early in the second half before levelling when Fabio Quagliarella's superb cross from the left was headed home by Marek Hamsik, who had been the guilty party from the spot. Hamsik then set up Quagliarella to put Napoli ahead with 18 minutes remaining and the points were sealed with two minutes left when Ezequiel Lavezzi slotted home.","Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Giguain both score twice for Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his third goal in as many games to continue his return to form and lift Barcelona to the top of Spain's La Liga on Saturday night. The Sweden striker, who was criticized after his scoring streak dried up in the first two months of this year, netted the only goal against fourth-placed Mallorca to put the defending champions three points clear of Real Madrid. Real can return to the summit on goal difference with victory in Sunday's Madrid derby against Atletico. Mallorca had won 12 of 13 matches at home this season, and should have taken the lead in the second minute when Aritz Aduriz smashed a shot against the post. Barcelona started with top scorer Lionel Messi and playmaker Xavi on the bench, while ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal at English club Arsenal, while Thierry Henry and Gerard Pique were also rested. The European champions had a goal disallowed in the 12th minute when young winger Pedro Rodriguez was ruled to be offside. Mallorca keeper Dudu Aouate then denied Gabriel Milito and Ibrahimovic, and the islanders hit the post again just before halftime from Borja Valero's free-kick. Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola brought on Messi for Andres Iniesta seven minutes after the break, and Xavi replaced Yaya Toure around the hour mark. The move worked as Ibrahimovic pounced to score his 15th goal this season from close range in the 63rd minute after Pepe Luis Marti deflected Xavi's corner at his own goalkeeper, and Aouate could only manage a reflex block. Aouate did well to tip over a fierce Messi drive, and the in-form Argentina forward -- named the world's highest-earning player during the week -- should have doubled Barcelona's lead but surprisingly fired well over the bar. The Catalans then played out for time to clinch a 26th clean sheet this season for goalkeeper Victor Valdes. Mallorca can lose fourth place if Sevilla win at Villarreal on Sunday. Third-placed Valencia remained six points ahead of Mallorca after losing 3-0 to struggling Real Zaragoza in Saturday's late match. Valencia went behind four minutes before halftime to a thunderous left-foot shot from Uruguayan defender Diogo, and were reduced to 10 men just before the break when Nikola Zigic received a second yellow card. The giant Serbian was given a rare start in place of star striker David Villa, but was given an early bath after making an awkward lunge at a defender. Angel Javier Arizmendi doubled the lead with a goal against his former club in the 63rd minute after Edmilson's fine long pass helped him beat the offside trap, and Jiri Jarosik made it 3-0 eight minutes later as he stuck out a leg to divert a corner into the net. The win lifted Zaragoza four points clear of the relegation zone, with third-bottom Tenerife coming from behind to draw 1-1 at Malaga in the early match.","Barcelona move three points clear of Real Madrid with 1-0 victory at Mallorca .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth visited Wimbledon on Thursday, her first visit to the annual tennis tournament in 33 years. The queen, wearing a teal outfit and matching hat and holding a small bouquet, was escorted through the grounds as tennis fans rushed to catch a glimpse of her. The last time the queen attended the championships was in 1977, when she watched British player Virginia Wade win the ladies' singles title. The queen greeted a lineup of past Wimbledon champions that included Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, Venus and Serena Williams, Jelena Jankovic and Roger Federer. She then entered the royal box at Center Court, where she planned to watch Britain's fourth-seed Andy Murray play Finland's Jarkko Nieminen under mostly sunny skies. The queen also planned to have lunch at the clubhouse with current and former players. Organizers said poached salmon, new potatoes and the traditional Wimbledon treat of strawberries and cream were likely to be on the menu.","Queen's first visit to Wimbledon in 33 years .

"(CNN) -- The international governing body for athletics urged caution Friday after reports that the world-champion South African runner Caster Semenya has both male and female organs. The front cover of You magazine shows Semenya after a recent makeover. The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia and The Sun newspaper in Britain reported that gender tests ordered by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) show the 18-year-old is a hermaphrodite. Neither paper named the source of their information. IAAF spokesman Nick Davies would not discuss the findings with CNN. ""I simply haven't seen the results,"" Davies said. ""We have received the results from Germany, but they now need to be examined by a group of experts and we will not be in a position to speak to the athlete about them for at least a few weeks. ""After that, depending on the results, we will meet privately with the athlete to discuss further action."" Has Semenya been treated fairly? The IAAF issued a statement, saying no decision on the case will be announced until the experts can look at the results. A final decision regarding the case is not expected before the IAAF Council meets in late November in Monaco, the IAAF said. Davies also said the news reports should be treated with caution. The newspapers said extensive physical examinations of Semenya show she has no ovaries, but rather has internal testes, which are producing large amounts of testosterone. What is intersexuality? Semenya won the women's 800-meters gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin last month. She crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in 1 minute, 55.45 seconds -- the best women's time in the world this year. Defending champion Janeth Jepkosgei of Kenya took the silver and Jennifer Meadows of Britain claimed bronze. The IAAF said it was seeking tests on Semenya's gender even before that race. Davies said questions about her were first raised after her astonishing displays at the African junior championships in July, with her masculine build and surprising performance fueling the rumors. South Africans reacted angrily to Friday's reports, with one newspaper headline declaring ""outrage."" Sport and Recreation Minister Makhenkesi Stofile said he was ""shocked and disgusted"" at the treatment that Semenya has received from the media, the IAAF, and the world. ""She may be a hermaphrodite, but so what? She is still a girl,"" Stofile told a news conference in Pretoria. Even if Semenya has an unfortunate ""proportion of hormones,"" he said, she is still ""a young girl enjoying growing up."" Stofile said he believes the teenager's human rights have been violated and that she was not given a chance to understand what the gender testing was all about. South Africa will fight back if Semenya is excluded from further competition, Stofile said, adding, ""It will be a third world war."" All indications were Friday that, at the very least, Semenya may be able to keep the gold medal she won in Berlin. ""Our legal advice is that, if she proves to have an advantage because of the male hormones, then it will be extremely difficult to strip the medal off her, since she has not cheated,"" Davies told CNN. Semenya's countrymen -- including her father and the South Africa team manager -- have maintained that Semenya is a female. Thousands of supporters crammed the airport in Johannesburg when she returned from Berlin last month. And this week, the athlete appeared on the cover of a South African magazine wearing makeup, jewelry and a glamorous dress. Under IAAF rules, any time there is suspicion about an athlete's gender, the athlete can be asked to attend a medical evaluation before a panel consisting of a gynecologist, an endocrinologist, a psychologist, an internal medicine specialist and an expert on gender issues. There are chromosome tests and scans of the athlete's body, Davies has said. He called gender verification -- which is generally required only for female athletes -- ""an extremely complex procedure."" The process of gender verification has undergone big changes since it was first introduced for international competition in the 1960s, the IAAF said. The first mechanism involved ""rather crude and perhaps humiliating physical examinations,"" which soon gave way to mouth swabs to collect chromosomes, the IAAF said. There were too many uncertainties regarding the mouth swabs, so the IAAF abandoned them in 1991 and the International Olympic Committee discontinued them in 2000, the IAAF said. A proper test has yet to be found, the IAAF said, and the current round of tests is considered a good interim solution.","South African Sports Minister ""shocked and disgusted"" at Semenya treatment .

"(CNN) -- Spanish champions Barcelona remained five points clear of Real Madrid despite having two players sent off against Getafe on Saturday. Josep Guardiola's team played more than an hour with 10 men after Gerard Pique was dismissed, then substitute Rafael Marquez was ordered off in time added on to concede a penalty, but Barca still managed to pull off a 2-1 victory and remain undefeated in 21 La Liga matches this season. Second-placed Real had no such problems in defeating Barca's city neighbors Espanyol 3-0 in the late match, keeping within two victories of their great rivals. Barcelona took the lead after only seven minutes against visiting Getafe when world player of the year Lionel Messi curled in a superb left-foot effort for his 16th league goal in 18 appearances after a corner was not cleared. Defender Gerard Pique then saw red for a rash lunge in the 25th minute on Rafa Lopez, who prevented the hosts from doubling their lead just before halftime with a flying block to keep out striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic's goalbound shot. Mali midfielder Seydou Keita also should have scored but hit Getafe's sidenetting just before an hour, then a counter-attacking Messi set up stand-in captain Xavi to make it 2-0 on 67. Mexico defender Marquez, who came on at halftime, was red-carded in the second minute of injury-time after crudely pushing Kepa Blanco from behind when he seemed set to score, and Roberto Soldado netted the resulting spot-kick. It came too late for Getafe, who were left in seventh place, 24 points behind the leaders. Kaka scored for the first time since November as Real Madrid cruised to victory at home to Espanyol despite being without the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo. Defender Sergio Ramos headed home Esteban Granero's fifth-minute free-kick, while Brazil playmaker Kaka pounced to score the second goal after half an hour after goalkeeper Carlos Kameni did well to block Raul's header. Real seemed to take their foot off the pedal in the second spell until the 90th minute when Gonzalo Higuain showed silky skills to control a long ball, evade the defense and slot his 12th league goal of the season to clinch an 11th successive league win at the Bernabeu this season. Valencia consolidated third place with a 2-0 victory at home to Real Valladolid which left them eight points behind Real. Midfielder Ever Banega scored in the eighth minute and Spain striker David Villa doubled the lead after half an hour as Onesimo Sanchez made a losing start top his reign as coach of the 17th-placed visitors, who could drop into the bottom three after Sunday's fixtures.","Barcelona remain five points clear of Real Madrid, beating Getafe 2-1 despite two red cards .

"(LifeWire) -- When George Dello of San Diego was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and told he had at best five months to live, he didn't immediately begin the chemotherapy treatments his doctor recommended. Instead, he and his wife, Pam, drove up the California coast and spent a week among the redwoods north of San Francisco. Expert: Family and friends can help the terminally ill by spending time with them. ""These trees are 5 feet wide and 150 feet tall,"" said Dello, 43. ""They still have another 150 feet to grow and are going to stick around for another 1,000 years. When I thought about that, I'm just a flea on the bark. It's unbelievable."" The trip offered Dello, who worked in the auto repossession business, and his wife a chance to come to terms with the diagnosis in  August 2008, and to scratch the trip to the redwood forests off his life ""to do"" list while he was still relatively healthy. He died four months later. The idea that dying well is as important as living well gained cultural currency last year when Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University, delivered a final lecture a month after learning that his pancreatic cancer had spread and was inoperable. The lecture was viewed millions of times on the Internet and adapted into a best-selling book. ""We cannot change the cards we are dealt,"" Pausch, who died in July at age 47, told his audience, ""just how we play the hand."" ""Die the way you live"" It's easy, experts say, for terminally ill patients and their loved ones to focus so much on their medical care and other important practical matters, including funerals and wills, that a ""good"" death eludes them. Health permitting, a trip like the one Dello took with his wife can help, as can visits from friends and family. ""You're going to die the way you live,"" says Fran Moreland Johns, a former hospice volunteer and author of ""Dying Unafraid.""  ""Laughter, music, all of the things that have been important in your life -- if you put them to work for making your end times better, you can actually affect your dying days."" ""That's where Randy Pausch has set a wonderful example. He brought all of his skills to bear on living until the moment he died."" Tony Wallace, a retired foreign service officer from Arlington, Virginia, went on a Caribbean cruise with his wife, Susan, after he learned in September 2004 that he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. As his illness progressed, Wallace, a former adjunct professor of public policy at George Mason University, put his teaching and writing skills to work by starting a blog, ""Navigating Through ALS,"" and using it as a platform to help others suffering from the disease. ""I'm not a compiler of life lists of things I never got to do and places I never got to visit,"" Wallace wrote in December 2007. ""I look back on my life to date and view it as a well-judged race -- like a NASCAR race in which you don't set the speed record, but you don't crash, handle the curves well, and deliver a respectable performance."" Wallace died September 4, 2008 at age 67. Susan Wallace, a part-time editor, says her husband's illness, while painful and difficult, offered an opportunity of sorts. ""If I had to choose between a long-term illness and an immediate death, I think I would go for a long-term illness, although it was hard on both of us,"" she says. ""But the last four years have been incredible years, probably the best years of our marriage. We became closer than we ever were."" For friends and family . Friends and family can help tremendously simply by showing up, says Kathy Brandt, vice president of professional leadership, consumer and caregiver services for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. Often, she says, people worry so much about what to say to someone with a terminal illness -- or about saying the wrong thing -- that they just stay away. ""We need to put aside our selfish fears,"" says Brandt. ""That may sound a little harsh, but it's not really about us."" One way to avoid saying the wrong thing is to steer clear of cliches, she says. ""'God has a reason' or 'tomorrow will be another day' -- those kinds of things are trite, but they're also impersonal,"" says Brandt. ""If the person wants to chat and talk, then just ask a question or two and let the person talk. If the person's not physically well enough to do a lot of talking, ask if they'd like to hear a story about something that happened at work, or saying, 'Would you like me to read a story to you?' It's all about figuring out where the person is at and meeting them where they are."" Visits can be used to tie up loose ends or resolve old conflicts, says Brandt. Susan Wallace says her husband had time to repair one particularly nagging rift before he died, and Dello also took opportunities to resolve disputes with friends and former co-workers. ""Most people at the end of their life need closure,"" says Brandt. ""If they've offended someone or had an argument with somebody, they can say they're sorry. Oftentimes they like the opportunity to say goodbye to people. They may not say those words, but that's what those visits can be with friends and loved ones."" In Johns' view, the biggest hurdle for most people is overcoming their fear of the unknown and realizing that, for most, death ""is not the worst thing that's going to happen."" ""We don't know what dying is,"" says Johns. ""Whatever your religious background, it's easier for us to ignore death and pretend that it doesn't happen than to accept it as an unknown with all the other unknowns -- in this day and age there are a lot of them -- and deal with what we can and not be so spooked.""

"(CNN) -- Despite the recent recall of potentially contaminated Romaine, lettuce lovers don't have to nix key ingredients from their BLTs or face lifeless, leafless salads -- they just need to go to seed. Food-borne illness has been tied to E. coli 0145 found in commercially-grown lettuce sold to wholesalers, food service outlets and some in-store salad bars and delis. Lettuce E. coli outbreak spreads to fourth state . Not only can at-home growers skip this risk -- they'll also save money, enjoy a nearly endless variety of organic and heirloom options and have fresh salads at their fingertips all year around -- even without an outdoor garden. Restaurants assure customers lettuce is safe amid recall . Supplies you need: . Seeds . Lettuce grows in several major formats: loose leaf (like Lolla Rossa and Black Seeded Simpson), crisphead (Iceberg and Great Lakes), butterhead (Bibb and Buttercrunch), Cos (also called Romaine) and stem (mostly used in Chinese cooking). For small container gardens and windowboxes, loose leaf is a solid bet, as it grows quickly and doesn't need to establish deep roots. Most hardware, garden and variety stores carry a range of popular seed varieties -- often for $1 or less -- but adventurous gardeners may wish to explore colorful, flavor-packed heirloom and certified organic single-seed packets and blends from online retailers. The Seed Savers Exchange and D. Landreth stock dozens, from blazing Mascara to deep, dark Red Velvet. Containers . Just about any will do, from store bought terracotta pots and plastic window boxes to take-out containers, foil pie pans, halved two-liter bottles and emptied-out plastic clamshells from the supermarket. The vessel just needs to be food-safe, several inches deep and perforated at the bottom to allow drainage. Starting head lettuce in peat pots inside containers allows the option for transplant into a larger garden space -- or even sharing the bounty with friends. Picture yourself: Cool gardens . Soil . If it's going into the food, it's going into you. If possible, opt for chemical-free or organic potting soil -- increasingly available at major hardware stores and home centers. Lighting . Lightly shaded outdoor areas are ideal, as tender young leaves are susceptible to burning in bright sunlight, but windowboxes and kitchen counters can also produce surprisingly robust crops. If natural light isn't available, cool white bulbs and fluorescent lights can successfully stimulate vegetative growth. The seedlings need about 12 hours of light a day, and gardeners may need to adjust the distance from bulb to soil to figure out what works best in their home. You will also need a spray bottle and some plastic wrap. Instructions: . Place at least 2 inches of moist, lightly-packed potting soil into a container with drainage holes. Sprinkle a sparse layer of seeds on top of the soil and follow that with a very light dusting of soil. Mist the soil with a few pumps from a water bottle, lightly cover the container with plastic wrap and place in a warm, bright spot. The seedlings should germinate in about five days. Once they have, remove the plastic wrap and keep the container in the light for around 12 hours a day. Keep the soil moist with the spray bottle or gentle watering from a can or cup. Make sure the soil is draining and not pooling at the bottom of the container. Most crops will be ready to harvest and enjoy within three to four weeks for leaf varieties, and longer for more robust heads. Just snip leaves directly into a colander, rinse and enjoy the fruits -- and vegetables -- of your labor.","Potentially contaminated Romaine lettuce recalled after E. coli outbreak .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A nonprofit consumer group said Thursday that it will sue Bayer HealthCare, alleging ""deceptive and irresponsible"" advertising that contends selenium in two of its multivitamins may reduce men's risk of prostate cancer. One A Day Men's 50+ Advantage ads say selenium may cut men's risk of prostate cancer, a consumer group says. The Center for Science in the Public Interest said it informed the multinational company of its intent Thursday. David Schardt, the center's senior nutritionist, told reporters during a teleconference that the center already has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. ""We are standing behind all the claims we make in support of the products,"" Trish McKernan, Bayer's global spokeswoman, told CNN. ""The selenium claims are made by a [Food and Drug Administration]-approved qualified health claim. We regularly review the evidence, and we change our claims if necessitated. The emerging science hasn't compelled us to change our claims, and the FDA claim is intact."" Bayer's HealthCare division, based in Leverkusen, Germany, researches, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products. Bayer promotes One A Day Men's 50+ Advantage and One A Day Men's Health Formula multivitamins on package labels, TV and radio ads and on its Web site. In its promotions, the company says ""emerging research"" suggests that selenium might reduce the risk of prostate cancer, the center said. ""Did you know that there are more new cases of prostate cancer each year than any other cancer?"" according to one radio ad. ""Now there is something you can do."" Both dietary supplements contain 105 micrograms of the trace mineral selenium per daily dose, or about twice the Recommended Daily Allowance, which is 55 micrograms a day for adults, according to the center. Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living . ""It's astounding that a company such as Bayer ... would make such deceptive claims,"" the center's litigation director, Steve Gardner, told reporters during the same teleconference. Supporting the center in its letter of complaint to the FTC are nine researchers, who wrote a separate letter to Mary Engle, associate director of advertising practices. Among the signees are medical professionals from the Harvard School of Public Health, American Cancer Society and University of Illinois at Chicago Division of Pathology Research. All agree there is scant evidence to support Bayer's claim. A seven-year, $118 million study funded by the National Institutes of Health found last year that selenium does not prevent prostate cancer in healthy men, the center said. The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial involving 35,000 U.S. and Canadian men was halted in October when researchers determined that selenium was not protecting the men from prostate cancer and may have been causing diabetes in some of them. According to the researchers in their letter supporting the FTC's complaint, ""the federally financed study was the largest individually, randomized cancer prevention trial ever conducted, and, given its high rates of adherence and its statistical power, it is unlikely to have missed detecting a benefit of even a very modest size."" ""Bayer Healthcare is doing a disservice to men by misleading them about a protective role for selenium in prostate cancer,"" they added.

"(CNN) -- Spaniard Pablo Martin claimed his first European Tour win as a professional as he held off home hope Charl Schwartzel by a stroke to win the Alfred Dunhill Championship at Leopard Creek. Martin claimed the Portugal Open as an amateur, but has since endured a sorry run of form and only narrowly kept his tour card at the end of last season. But victory in the first tournament of the 2010 Race to Dubai has seen the 23-year-old create history as the first man to win European Tour events as both an amateur and professional. While Martin triumphed, South African favorite Ernie Els, who had been his closest challenger overnight, slumped to a sorry five-over 77, with a double  bogey on the famous 18th on the course which adjoins the Kruger National Park. Els, who will skip next week's South African Open, will see his run of winning a tournament every year since 1990 come to an end. Compatriot Schwartzel provided the main challenge to Martin and came close to forcing a playoff on the 18th. Two shots behind on the final tee, he pitched close with his third and holed for a birdie, forcing Martin to two-putt from long range to claim the title. After closing with as three-under-par 69 for a 17-under total of 271, Martin was overjoyed. ""It's an unbelievable feeling,"" he told www.europeantour.com. ""I am so happy and there was so much emotion today."" The 541-yard 18th - one of the toughest finishing holes in golf - claimed other victims than Els. Welshman Sion Bebb, only one behind after an eagle on the 13th, crashed to a sextuple bogey 11 after a poor tee shot and then two balls into the water. Ireland's Gareth Maybin also took seven when lying third and Frenchman Michael Lorenzo-Vera had an eight to fall from fourth to eighth. But Martin kept his nerve to set a unique record, which New Zealander Danny Lee and Irishman Shane Lowry can match after their wins as amateurs on the European Tour last season before turning pro. Home golfer Robert Allenby carded a five-under 66 to win the Australian PGA title by four shots at Coolum.

"(CNN) -- David Beckham returned to the AC Milan team to help inspire them to an emphatic 5-2 victory over Genoa on Wednesday which kept up the pressure up on Inter Milan at the top of Italy's Serie A. The England midfielder is in his second spell with Milan having joined on loan from Los Angeles Galaxy for six months and replaced the injured Alexandre Pato in the starting line-up. Despite not getting on the scoresheet, Beckham's passing created problems throughout and he impressed on the right of a three-man attack in a game watched by England coach Fabio Capello. Genoa took the lead in the 25th minute through Giuseppe Sculli gave, but a penalty from Ronaldinho, who had earlier missed from the spot, brought Leonardo's team level in the 32nd minute. Thiago Silva gave Milan the lead at the break before two goals from Marco Borriello early in the second half and a penalty from Dutch international Klaas-Jan Huntelaar put the game beyond Genoa, who grabbed a consolation from David Suazo 11 minutes from time. Elsewhere, Inter Milan continued where they left off before the winter break with a 1-0 win over Chievo in Verona thanks to Mario Balotelli's first-half strike. Goran Pandev was handed his debut by Jose Mourinho following his arrival on a free transfer earlier this month and he was involved in the only goal of the game. Neat work by Pandev and midfielder Wesley Sneijder sent Balotelli through on goal and his first shot was saved by Chievo keeper Stefano Sorrentino. Juventus returned to winning ways after three consecutive defeats in all competitions before the winter break with a 2-1 win over Parma thanks to goals from Hasan Salihamidzic and Paolo Castellini's own-goal after Nicola Amoruso had equalized for Parma. Elsewhere, Roma conceded twice in stoppage time as they drew 2-2 with Cagliari while Napoli climbed up to fourth with a 2-0 win over Atalanta and Fiorentina hammered Siena 5-1. Lazio eased their relegation worries with a 4-1 victory over Livorno as Catania boosted their survival hopes with a tense 1-0 win over Bologna.

"(CNN) -- Cholera has arrived in the Dominican Republic, and so have fear and worry. The bacterial intestinal disease has already killed more than 1,100 people in neighboring Haiti and hospitalized more than 18,000 others. Dominican officials said Tuesday the first case has been detected in their nation -- a 32-year-old Haitian construction worker who returned Friday to the Dominican Republic from a visit to his homeland. Although the lone reported case is the result of a migrant bringing the disease into the country and is not related to local water or food contamination, many Dominicans are still worried. ""Yes, yes. Of course,"" said Yehenny Rodriguez, a private security guard who lives in Santo Domingo, the nation's capital. ""There's much worry in the country. This is a strong disease that people get easily. ""Everybody's talking about it."" Asked if people are concerned, Dominican physician Martin Madera had a succinct and emphatic answer: ""Indisputably, yes."" Officials in the Dominican Republic, which already has a strained public health system, have issued a maximum health alert. The disease, which can cause deadly diarrhea and vomiting, is contracted by ingesting contaminated food or water. Dominicans are being urged to wash their hands often and to be careful about what they eat and drink. All forms of media -- television, radio, newspapers, social networks -- are being employed to get the word out, said Madera. ""The most important thing is that the population be advised,"" Madera said. Rodriguez said Wednesday he is taking that advice seriously -- washing his hands often and not eating any food that wasn't prepared at home, especially street food. Many others are following the same practice, he said. The World Health Organization rates the Dominican Republic's health system as the 51st most efficient among 191 countries. That ranking places it in a lower position than the United Kingdom (No. 18) and the United States (No. 37), but higher than South Korea (No. 58) and Mexico (No. 61). Madera, who spent two weeks treating patients in Haiti after January's deadly earthquake, is confident that the Dominican health system can handle an outbreak -- up to a certain point. ""We have sufficient medicine and medical institutions that can handle cases that may come up -- for now,"" he said Wednesday. And Dominican authorities, he said, are taking a proactive approach. Efforts are being made to investigate passengers who were on the same bus in which the ill Haitian traveled to the Dominican Republic last week. Also, he said, all reported cases of diarrhea are being investigated. ""Haitians with diarrhea get greater interest,"" Madera said. The Dominican Republic Ministry of Public Health is receiving help in contingency planning and implementation from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Todd Haskell, spokesman for the USAID office in Santo Domingo. The CDC also is assisting the public health ministry in establishing laboratory testing for cholera, Haskell said in an e-mail. Both agencies started offering their assistance October 22, the spokesman said. Despite Madera's confidence that the Dominican Republic can handle an outbreak, he said, ""it can reach a point where it can overtake a nation's capacity to treat it."" Should that occur, he said, a public state of emergency would be declared and private physicians and health institutions would be called upon to join the battle. For now, he said, the situation is under control. The ill patient, identified as Wilmo Louwes, was hospitalized and immediately isolated in the town of Higuey, near the eastern resort city of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. No firm numbers exist for how many Haitians and Haitian-descended Dominicans live and work in the Dominican Republic. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights placed the number in 1999 as 500,000 to 700,000. Human Rights Watch reported in 2001 that the head of the Dominican army estimated there were about 1 million Haitians in the Dominican Republic. The Haitian embassy in the Dominican Republic gave a similar figure that year. A widespread cholera outbreak could prove devastating for the Dominican Republic if tourists decide to stay away, because the Caribbean island nation relies heavily on tourism. In 2004, for example, the nation of 9 million inhabitants had 4.2 million tourists, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Tourism reported. Of those tourists, more than 4.2 million came by air and more than 455,000 were cruise ship passengers. The services sector of the economy, which includes tourism, employs about 64 percent of the workforce and contributes 55 percent of the gross domestic product, the measure of the nation's services and products.","NEW: USAID and the CDC are offering help, a U.S. spokesman says .

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Surging inflation in China has the government worried enough that it's adopting new measures, state media said Wednesday. Government actions might include food subsidies, price limits, reinforced punishment for speculating on food, and steps to prevent hoarding, China Daily said. Mayors also might be forced to account for insufficient vegetable supplies and volatile prices. Inflation in China is rising so quickly that it's sending shoppers across the border, to Hong Kong. Mainland Chinese are returning with necessities such as meat and produce, as much as they can carry on a train ride. While in Hong Kong, which is a day trip from parts of mainland China, shoppers also can save by grabbing a meal at McDonald's. The fast-food chain is raising menu prices in China by as much as 1 yuan [15 cents US] per item because of rising food costs. McDonald's is keeping prices in check in Hong Kong. The chain, with more than 1,000 outlets in China, is raising prices there for the first time this year, Xinhua said. In 36 Chinese cities, the average wholesale prices for 18 kinds of vegetables have surged by 62.4 percent from a year earlier, the Ministry of Commerce said. Chinese doing marketing in Hong Kong also are loading up on necessities such as toilet paper, diapers and shampoo. With their hands full, they shop busily at supermarkets, sundry stores and produce markets, especially near train stations. One woman described significant savings, such as oranges selling for about twice the price in China, as compared with Hong Kong. Last week, the state-run Xinhua news agency said that China's consumer price index had hit a 25-month high of 4.4 percent in October. The government's full-year inflation target is 3 percent. China's Ministry of Commerce has sold 62,400 tons of pork and 210,000 tons of sugar from reserves since the end of September, in an attempt to stabilize food prices. The ministry also says it will work with other government agencies to try to cool inflation, according to China Daily. China is under pressure as capital flows into the economically vibrant country, the newspaper said, citing Central Bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan. The country drew about $7.7 billion in foreign direct investment in October, up 7.9 percent from a year earlier, China Daily said. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, which generally governs itself. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, unlike China's yuan, or renminbi.","Moves might include food subsidies and price limits .

"(CNN)  -- Goal machine Cristiano Ronaldo scored two first half goals in quick succession to power Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Malaga in the Bernabeu, but also earned his second red card of the season. Ronaldo's strikes all but sealed victory for Real by halftime, but he blotted his copybook with a flying elbow earning him his marching orders in the 70th minute, his second dismissal this season. But it was a much-needed win for Real, who cut the gap at the top on Barcelona, who won 3-0 at Valladolid on Saturday, to five points. Malaga had the better of the early exchanges and might have taken a shock lead before a fine team move led to Kaka feeding his fellow superstar Ronaldo from the right. He duly converted with a first time shot for a 35th minute opener and three minutes later he was on the scoresheet again, connecting on the volley with Guti's clever pass forward to score his second. Just before halftime Ronaldo might have completed his hat-trick as a trademark free kick was parried away but he has scored 15 goals in 16 games for Real this season. In other matches on Sunday, Tenerife held third-placed Valencia to a 0-0 draw while Real Mallorca went fourth on goal difference ahead of Deportivo La Coruna after claiming a 1-1 draw at Espanyol. Valencia showed little of the form which saw them dispatch Villarreal 4-1 last week and aside from a deflected David Silva shot which went close and a David Navarro header offered scant threat in attack. Pablo Osvaldo gave Espanyol the lead just after halftime with Bonja Valero equalizing from the spot in the 80th minute.","Real Madrid beat Malaga 2-0 in the Bernabeu to cut Barcelona's lead to five points .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Jeff Walker says from as far back as he can remember, he always wanted to be a father. Jeff Walker, with his two daughters, tried to adopt, but ultimately turned to surogacy to build a family. ""It was always something I knew, from the time I was a child."" Just like his 3-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, who says she wants to be a mommy someday, Jeff says, ""I knew I wanted to be a daddy."" Walker, a Manhattan music executive, says he and his partner had talked about adopting a baby years ago. But after three emotionally draining, failed attempts at adoption, they decided to turn to surrogacy. They contacted Circle Surrogacy, a Boston agency that specializes in gay clients. Their child was conceived with a donor egg, and then the embryo implanted in the surrogate, or carrier. After Elizabeth was born, Walker and his partner separated. He then made a critical decision -- to become a dad again, single, and by choice. ""I realized my family, my two-dad family was going to look different than I thought it was going to look,"" he said. Without a partner, he would face even steeper challenges raising Elizabeth and a sibling alone. Walker says he gave the decision a lot of thought. ""That was the only part that was really controversial, because I do think there are a lot of challenges that single parents face, but at the same time I felt I was capable of handling those challenges,"" he said. His second daughter, Alexandra, was born two years ago to the same surrogate, implanted with an egg from a different donor. Walker, 45, is one of a growing number of single men -- both gay and straight -- who are opting to become fathers alone, with the help of gestational surrogacy. Surrogacy experts say because the practice is not regulated, many surrogacy arrangements are handled privately by individuals. Precise figures are hard to come by, but experts say there's no doubt the United States is experiencing a surrogacy baby boom. Celebrities like Ricky Martin and Clay Aiken announced this year they had had babies with the help of surrogates and the the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, representing scores of reproductive clinics, reports that the number of gestational surrogate births in the country quadrupled between 1996 and 2006.  Watch more on the surrogacy boom » . Surrogacy experts say gestational surrogacy has increased steadily since the advent of in vitro fertilization in the early 1980s, because it provides an extra layer of emotional and legal protection for the client. The egg donor usually does not even know the client, and unlike the legally contentious ""Baby M"" case from the 1980s, the surrogate is not giving birth to her genetic child. ""It rises as an issue far less frequently with gestational surrogacy, because women never see it as their child to begin with,"" said John Weltman, president of Circle Surrogacy. His agency, which expects more than 70 babies to be born in 2009, has seen a 50 percent growth in the number of single male clients over the past year. Walker and other men are willing to pay well over $100,000 to have a baby through surrogacy -- the final cost depending on the number of IVF treatments necessary and how much is paid by insurance. Circle is not the only major surrogacy provider experiencing a single-dad surge. At Growing Generations, a Los Angeles, California, agency that facilitates about 100 births a year, the number of single men seeking surrogates has doubled in the past three years, spokeswoman Erica Bowers said. Although most of their single male clients are gay, surrogacy providers say a smaller but growing number are straight. Steven Harris, a New York malpractice and personal-injury attorney, says he gave up trying to get married when he realized his primary motive was to start a family. Harris, 54, says he knew he made the right decision after 21-month old Ben was born. ""I thought getting married was the only way to go, because I did want a family. But having Ben, I feel complete now,"" Harris says.","Single men who want children find surrogate births better option than adoption .
Most such fathers are gay, but straight men use surrogacy as well .

"(CNN)  -- As the United States works with Israelis and Palestinians to sustain Mideast peace talks, another diplomatic effort to forge a two-state solution is quietly but quickly moving to the center of American foreign policy. In about 100 days, the people of South Sudan are to vote on whether to declare independence from the government in Khartoum. That deadline was set when the two sides signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005, which promised this option. There is little suspense as to the outcome: Every reliable source indicates that South Sudan will vote for separation, dividing Africa's largest country and taking with it some 80 percent of known Sudanese oil reserves. No, the critical choice that leaders in both North and South face is between a future of peaceful coexistence or a return to chaos and war in a place tragically familiar with both. While there are obviously differences, these situations in the Mideast and Sudan have more in common than the painful process of division. Each features disputes over land and resources, religious and ethnic differences, and conflicting narratives of bloodshed and loss. Time is a critical element in every peace process. And with its referendum fast approaching, Sudan, too, faces the tyranny of the onrushing calendar. The deadline for the Southern referendum promised in the peace agreement, January 9, 2011, is not negotiable. But exactly how the North and South will simultaneously separate while remaining interconnected must be. Southern Sudan may possess most of the known petroleum reserves, but the pipelines to market for that oil run through the North. Millions of Southerners displaced by the war will continue to live in Khartoum, and Northerners will live in the South. Every dry season, herders from the North's Arab Misseriya tribes cross into what will likely become the country of Southern Sudan and then return. The Nile will continue to flow northward, regardless of borders and politics. Boundaries must simultaneously be demarcated and accommodating. And the parties need to finalize the details fast enough to ensure that violence cannot fill the vacuum. The last war between North and South lasted for decades and claimed millions of lives. Earlier this year, then-Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told Congress that, over the next five years, Southern Sudan is the place where ""a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur."" And while we try to prevent the next potential wave of genocide, we cannot ignore the fact that Darfur's tragedy remains unresolved. Even as America asks how it can help Southern Sudan prepare for the likely burdens of statehood, it must also consider the Sudan that remains. Attention to Darfur must not be a casualty of our necessary fixation on the North-South crisis. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the administration has launched a heightened campaign of diplomatic engagement. President Obama joined U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Vice President Ali Osman Taha of the North and Salva Kiir, leader of the South, in New York last week to highlight the imperatives of peace, while he has also reinforced the American diplomatic presence in the region. Congress must also weigh in. I have written legislation to put Congress on record to reinforce the American commitment to see the peace agreement through, to lay the groundwork for what will come and to reinvigorate the Darfur peace process. One painful lesson from years of Mideast peacemaking is that even when the elements that will constitute an accord may seem clear from the outside, the compromises and choices that will make it possible are difficult to accept, sequence and execute. Time in Sudan is short and the stakes are high. Although the Sudanese themselves will own their future, America must now help North and South Sudan to find a peaceful path forward. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Kerry.","John Kerry: South Sudan likely to vote for independence, raising specter of more war with North .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal came back from two goals down to claim a 4-2 victory over Bolton at the Emirates Stadium which saw them climb to the top of the English Premier League. Bolton, who had been beaten 2-0 by the Gunners on Sunday, raced into an early lead through Gary Cahill who finished well from close range to direct his shot past Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia in the seventh minute. Owen Coyle's side then doubled their advantage from the penalty spot through Matthew Taylor after Arsenal midfielder Denilson had fouled Lee Chung-yong inside the area. But Arsene Wenger's young side kept their composure and pulled a goal back before halftime through Tomas Rosicky who lashed an angled shot past Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen.  Arsenal grabbed a controversial equalizer in the 52nd minute when Cesc Fabregas latched on to Andrey Arshavin's pass to slip the ball through Jaaskelainen's legs but there had appeared to be an earlier foul when William Gallas appeared to catch Mark Davies on the ankle. The turnaround was complete when Thomas Vermaelen fired home Arsenal's third after Abou Diaby had knocked down a corner into the path of the Belgian defender. Arsenal scored their fourth -- and the goal required to send them top of the table -- in the 85th minute when Eduardo slipped in Arshavin and the Russian made no mistake to fire the ball past Jaaskelainen. Wenger's side are level on points with Chelsea on 48 points, and are level with a goal difference of 34, but the Gunners go top having scored more goals than their London rivals. Elsewhere, Liverpool produced a defiant performance to help ease the pressure on Rafael Benitez with a 2-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield thanks to a brace from Dirk Kuyt. The Holland international gave Liverpool the lead in the sixth minute with a low shot from the edge of the area which flew past Heurelho Gomes' right-hand after he had been set up by Italian playmaker Alberto Aquilani. Liverpool, who were without the injured Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres, showed their defensive discipline to keep out Spurs and should have been out of sight by the time they were awarded an injury-time penalty after David Ngog was brought down by Sebastien Bassong. Kuyt scored the first effort only to be ordered to re-take by referee Howard Webb, but the Dutchman held his nerve to send Gomes the wrong way and keep Liverpool in the race for the fourth Champions League place. Meanwhile Aston Villa beat Blackburn Rovers 6-4 in a thrilling English League Cup semifinal second leg tie to go through 7-4 on aggregate and secure a Wembley final against either Manchester United or Manchester City. A Nikola Kalinic brace had Rovers ahead, but Stephen Warnock slotted in before Christopher Samba was sent off. James Milner converted the subsequent penalty and a Steven Ngonzi own-goal and Gabriel Agbonlahor and Emile Heskey's strikes seemed to seal it. Volleys from Martin Olsson and Brett Emerton gave Rovers hope before Ashley Young curled home to wrap up the win for Martin O'Neill's side.","Arsenal came back from two goals down to claim a 4-2 victory over Bolton at the Emirates Stadium which saw go top of the Premier League.

"(CNN) -- Veteran golfer Jim Furyk insists that the timing of Tiger Woods' headline-grabbing post-sex scandal interviews on Sunday did not take the gloss off his first U.S. PGA Tour victory since 2007. The 39-year-old was still playing out the final hole of the Transitions Championship in Florida when his fellow American was broadcast on two television channels in his first comments since announcing that he will return to action at the Masters next month. Woods was criticized by some players after making his first statement admitting marital infidelities during the World Match Play tournament in Arizona after a controversy that emerged just before the Chevron World Challenge event last December. Woods was due to host that post-season tournament, which Furyk also won -- but his success but was completely overshadowed by the intense media speculation over the world No. 1. But Furyk was just relieved to have claimed his first victory on the world's premier golf circuit since the Canadian Open two and a half years ago. ""Shoot, no-one was watching me then,"" he quipped on the PGA Tour Web site after completing a one-shot victory over Korea's K.J. Choi at Palm Harbor's Innisbrook course in Tampa Bay following a four-hour delay caused by a thunderstorm. ""You know what, tomorrow the paper is going to read that I won the golf tournament, and I don't really care if it's a three-page spread or a little blurb in the corner of the paper because the article is about him. ""I won the damn thing and it really doesn't matter to me. I've never been someone that's craved the notoriety or the limelight. I can live with it and I'm fine with it."" Furyk claimed his 14th win on tour, 58 tournaments after his victory in Canada, despite faltering with a bogey at the last hole which came after a nervy near-shanked shot from the trees off the fairway. ""I can't tell you how happy I am,"" he said. ""Hindsight, I wish I would have stamped it out and knocked it right in the center of the 17th green, right in the center of the 18th green and got it out there in style. ""But my family likes to tell me I never do that, I make it interesting, and once again I did."" Furyk moved up three places to sixth in the world rankings, which Woods still tops by a large margin from Steve Stricker despite his absence from the circuit so far this year. Stricker finished in a tie for eighth on six-under-par 278, seven shots behind Furyk.","Jim Furyk says he is not angry with Tiger Woods over timing of Sunday's interviews .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Zinedine Zidane is sure of the quality most necessary to create a successful team: mutual respect. Zidane: the ex-footballer identifies mutual respect as the most important quality that players need to exhibit within a team. It is a telling observation from a man whose incredible achievements on the football pitch were only slightly marred by explosions of rage that often seemed to be provoked by a perceived lack of respect from others. ""When you have 23 players (in a football team's squad), everyone has their personality, one is stronger, one more shy, one more reserved, one more arrogant,"" he tells CNN. ""But the most important is respect between all of us."" The French maestro, who hung up his boots two years ago, certainly enjoyed the respect of his teammates. Former coaches and fellow players speak in reverent tones about him. In large part, this is due to his sublime talent -- few would argue with the summation that he was the most gifted footballer of his generation. Yet this immense ability was accompanied by a shyness and humility notoriously absent among many of today's top sportsmen, and by an intense professionalism that bordered on obsession. Aimé Jacquet, the coach of the French national team that Zidane guided to victory in the 1998 thanks to two headed goals in the final against Brazil, says the player was gifted with ""an internal vision."" ""He can make the ball do whatever he wants. But it is his drive which takes him forward. He is 100 per cent football,"" he told the British newspaper The Guardian. It was this dedication that allowed the French-born son of Algerian immigrants to escape his tough upbringing in a deprived suburb of Marseilles and make it on the big stage. Starting out as a 17-year-old for French side Cannes, Zidane went on to play for Bordeaux, the Italian team Juventus and finished his career at a Real Madrid side packed with many of the world's top talent. Under the tenure of President Florentino Pérez the club made a host of big-name transfers including Portuguese international Luis Figo, Brazil star Ronaldo, Zidane and David Beckham. Zidane says great teams need clear and defined leaders that the players can rally behind. At Real he identifies former teammate and current club captain Raúl González as such a player. Nicknamed the Galácticos, the Madrid team frequently underperformed, however, under the sagging weight of expectation and an excess of big egos. Zidane didn't allow Real's inconsistencies to hold him back, however. By the end his career, he had won almost every major honor in the game including the World Cup and European Championships with France and the crown of FIFA World Player of the Year a record three times. In 2004, Forbes magazine named him the 42nd-highest paid athlete in the world, with earnings of $15.8 million a year. ""People tell me today, 'yeah, it's easy for you' and I say no, because when I started no-one knew me. I had the skills of course but I made that path myself, and for everything you have to do that."" And it is this same mental toughness that has allowed him to shrug off the taunts of the racists and emerge a national hero in a country whose immigrant community has enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the state. Zizou, as he is known affectionately in France, has tried to stay above the murky world of race politics, only once being drawn into defending his Algerian heritage after a small-minded attack on his father's war record. This came after the World Cup win over Brazil, when a member of the far right political party the Front National suggested Zidane's father was ""a harki"" -- an Arabic word for Algerians who fought alongside the French in Algeria's bloody independence struggle. After a 2001 friendly match between France and Algeria had to be abandoned when angry young French Arabs invaded the pitch, Zidane was forced to break his silence, publically repudiating the libel. He still seems reluctant to be turned into a spokesman for France's North African community -- he tells CNN he would prefer to be thought of as an ""example"" for immigrant children rather than as a hero. Even so, his heritage is clearly something he remains deeply connected to. So that when he was famously sent off in the final of the 2006 World Cup after a headbutt on Italian defender Marco Materazzi in the last act of his career, it was an alleged slur against his family that provoked the attack. The headbutt was shocking but not entirely unexpected. Throughout his career, Zidane was prone to flashes of temper on the pitch -- he was sent off 14 times in his years as a professional footballer. Nevertheless, it was an ignoble end for such a prodigious talent. Zidane has refused to apologise to Materazzi because he says that would be like condoning the Italian's comments -- exactly what Materazzi said is still in dispute, and two years on, he remains philosophical and largely unrepentent about the incident. ""When people say I shouldn't have finished the World Cup on that note, I don't look at it that way,"" he says. ""My career is much more than that moment.""","French ex-footballer Zinedine Zidane won every major honor during his career .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Distinguished scientist Stephen Hawking was said to be in a ""comfortable"" condition Tuesday after spending the night in hospital, Cambridge University said in a statement. Stephen Hawking in Pasadena, California, in March. The 67-year-old, who suffers from a degenerative condition, was taken to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge by ambulance in a ""very ill"" condition on Monday. ""He is comfortable and his family is looking forward to him making a full recovery,"" the university, where Hawking is a professor of mathematics, said in a short statement. Hawking -- a physicist, cosmologist, astronomer and mathematician -- is considered by many to be the greatest scientist of recent years. His numerous books include ""A Brief History of Time,"" a global bestseller exploring the origins of the universe which also made him one of the world's best known scientists. Hawking suffers from ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. ALS is usually fatal within a few years, but Hawking has lived with the disease since he was diagnosed in 1963. ALS is ""a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord,"" according to the ALS Association. ""Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord... to the muscles throughout the body."" So when motor neurons die, the brain can no longer control muscle movement. The disease has left him wheelchair-bound and paralyzed -- he is able to move only a few fingers on one hand. He is completely dependent on others or technology for virtually everything, communicating through a speech synthesizer. On his Web site, Hawking has written about living with ALS. ""I try to lead as normal a life as possible, and not think about my condition, or regret the things it prevents me from doing, which are not that many,"" he wrote. He added, ""I have been lucky, that my condition has progressed more slowly than is often the case. But it shows that one need not lose hope.""  Watch Larry King's interview with Hawking in 1999 » . Sharon Matland, vice president of patient services for the ALS Association, told CNN Monday, ""He is living an amazing life."" She said about 350,000 people worldwide have the disease. Hawking has been married and divorced twice. In 2004, police completed an investigation into accusations by Hawking's daughter that his second wife was abusing him. Authorities said they found no proof. He has three children and one grandchild, according to his Web site. Hawking was born in Oxford, England, on a date auspicious for his future career: January 8, 1942 -- the 300th anniversary of the death of astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei. Professor Peter Haynes, head of the university's department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, said: ""Professor Hawking is a remarkable colleague, we all hope he will be amongst us again soon."" At Cambridge, he holds the position of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics -- one of the world's most prestigious academic posts which was held from 1669 to 1702 by Isaac Newton, who laid the foundations of modern physics by discovering the universal law of gravity. Hawking has guest-starred, as himself, on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""The Simpsons."" He also said if he had the choice of meeting Newton or Marilyn Monroe, his choice would be Marilyn. In October, CNN's Becky Anderson interviewed Hawking. ""Over the last twenty years, observations have to a large extent confirmed the picture I painted in 'A Brief History of Time.'"" he said then. ""The one major development that was not anticipated was the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating now, rather than slowing down... We live in the most probable of all possible worlds.  Watch the CNN interview » . Hawking also predicted ""great dangers"" for the human race and said the species would have to look beyond the earth for its long-term survival. ""I believe that the long-term future of the human race must be in space. It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster on planet Earth in the next hundred years, let alone next thousand, or million,"" he said. ""I see great dangers for the human race ... but I'm an optimist. If we can avoid disaster for the next two centuries, our species should be safe as we spread into space.""

"Conakry, Guinea (CNN) -- Guinea once again has postponed the second round of voting in its presidential election, the new head of the West African country's National Independent Electoral Commission announced Friday. Gen. Siaka Toumani Toure, the Malian general who replaced controversial commission chief Louseny Camara on Tuesday, said it ""is not possible"" to hold the run-off vote between the two candidates, Cellou Dalein Diallo and Alpha Conde, on Sunday as planned. No new date was set for the next round of voting. The ballot was initially scheduled to be held two weeks after the first round voting, which occurred June 27.  Diallo won 44 percent and Conde 18 percent. The second round already had been postponed three times because of technical problems, mismanagement and internal disputes. Camara had been accused by Diallo's UFDG party of supporting Conde and stealing ballots from a populous Conakry suburb where Camara served as poll administrator. Camara has denied the accusations, but on Thursday he was sentenced to a year in prison and fined 2,000,000 Guinean francs (about $300) by Conakry courts for fraud in the first round. ""We have no comment yet about the new delay,"" said Moustapha Naite, a spokesman for Alpha Conde's RPG party. And Oury Bah, the vice president of UFDG, said, ""We agree with the new delay because there are many problems to fix."" Experts are worried that the delay might spark renewed violence, which could threaten the democratic transition. Both sides have blamed the other for attacking its activists. Bah said that renewed violence between supporters of Conde and Diallo after a UFDG rally on Thursday in Conakry killed one UFDG supporter and injured some 30 more. ""Yesterday our supporters were attacked by elements of RPG. ... One is now in a coma and another died this morning,"" Bah said. Naite denied this claim and said RPG supporters were the victims of poisoned water sold at a rally for Conde in Conakry on Friday. ""Today all we can say is that at our meeting we have over 60 people laying in the hospital because of poisoned water that they sold at the Palais du Peuple,"" Naite said, referring to Friday's gathering place for RPG supporters. Two people were killed Tuesday in clashes between police and supporters of UFDG, who were demanding the replacement of Camara as the electoral commission head. Bah saw Tuesday's violence as evidence that parts of the government are biased against UFDG. ""The security forces are not neutral,"" he said. Prime Minister Jean-Marie Dore ""and his minister of security do not want elections."" Guinea has been ruled by a military junta since a coup after the death of longtime autocrat Lansana Conte in December 2008.","Guinea delays presidential run-off for fourth time .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United have warned French side Le Havre they will take action against them unless they stop repeating claims that the English Premier League champions offered financial inducements to Paul Pogba's family in order to lure the teenager to Old Trafford. Manchester United have vehemently denied any wrong-doing in the signing of Paul Pogba (left). United have grown angry at the sustained assault by Le Havre, which came in the wake of a transfer ban imposed on Chelsea last week for a similar infringement of the rules. Now club officials have written to the French club, and made them aware in the strongest terms that they must either put up, or shut up. ""In response to the wholly unfounded comments widely reported in the media of Le Havre President, Jean-Pierre Louvel, Manchester United wish to categorically confirm that as a matter of club policy and in accordance with the applicable football regulations, we do not offer inducements to the parents of players who sign for the club such as monetary payments or the purchase of houses,"" said United in a statement on their official Web site. ""Manchester United have today written to Le Havre to put it on notice that action will be taken if such allegations are repeated in relation to the transfer of Paul Pogba."" Le Havre had claimed the matter was being referred to FIFA for their investigation although, as yet, the world governing body have not acknowledged receipt. When the Pogba issue was first raised last week, United officials suggested that there was no contract for the 16-year-old to break, therefore the Red Devils could not be offering inducements to do so. However, they have been annoyed by Le Havre's allegations of impropriety, which has prompted the stinging outburst. ""Manchester United are entirely satisfied that the transfer of Paul Pogba has been conducted in accordance with the regulations set down by the world governing body, FIFA,"" the statement added. ""Manchester United are ready to defend any claim brought against them by Le Havre to FIFA.

"(CNN) -- The San Francisco Giants won their first World Series title since 1954 on Monday, after the California-based team beat the Texas Rangers 3-1 away at the Arlington Ballpark to secure a 4-1 victory in Major League baseball's best-of-seven-game contest. After narrowly missing out in the ""Fall Classic"" in 1962, 1989 and 2002, the result marked the Giants' sixth overall World Series win, but only their first since the franchise moved from New York to the west coast city in 1958. The game was the end of an incredible season for the Giants -- who qualified for the final by beating the Atlanta Braves and defending National League Champions the Philadelphia Phillies -- after they clinched a play-off place on the last day of the six-month regular season. But it was a disappointing night for the Rangers, who were appearing in the World Series final for the first time in the team's 50-year history. Is the Giants' triumph bad for baseball? Veteran shortstop Edgar Renteria -- who produced the winning hit in the final game of the 1997 series for the Florida Marlins -- sealed the win for the Giants with a three-run homer in the seventh innings, and the 35-year-old Colombian was subsequently named the series' Most Valuable Player. ""I didn't forget that we were playing a great offensive team like Texas,"" Renteria told the Giants' official website. ""That's why I told my teammates, 'Keep playing,' because we know they can tie the game right away."" But the Texas-based team were unable to catch the eventual winners, and American starting pitcher Tim Linecum was also invaluable for the Giants, striking out 10 and scattering three hits over eight innings, allowing just one home run to Rangers player Nelson Cruz -- his side's only score. ""I felt pretty collected,"" Linecum said. ""From the first inning on, my adrenaline kind of just dissipated and I was able to calm down. I was very poised out there."" The Rangers had hoped for more on their World Series debut, but the team who had not won a play-off game until three weeks ago admitted they were beaten by better players. ""Not much worked for us this series. We won one game,"" Ian Kinsler of the Rangers told his side's official website. ""They pitched better than us. They did everything better than us.""","San Francisco Giants beat Texas Rangers 3-1 to win best-of-seven World Series 4-1 .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's recovery from hip replacement surgery last month has been slower than predicted, but her daughter disputed a report that the actress ""suffered a setback"" Saturday. ""She is no different than she was from yesterday or the day before,"" Francesca Hilton, who was at her mother's hospital bedside, said Saturday. She was awake watching TV and eating, Hilton said. Gabor's husband, meanwhile, told CNN that she ""went into shock"" Saturday morning, delaying her release from Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center that had been planned for this weekend. The 93-year-old actress is now expected to go to her Bel Air, California, home Monday, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt said. Von Anhalt said Hilton would not know of her mother's condition because he has told doctors not to talk to her. The stepfather and stepdaughter have had a cold relationship in recent years that included a legal fight over a mortgage on Gabor's Bel Air mansion. The German prince, 67, married Gabor 24 years ago. Francesca Hilton, 64, is Gabor's only child, the product of her second marriage to hotel magnate Conrad Hilton. Gabor, who suffered a broken hip in a fall from her bed July 17, underwent surgery July 19. Von Anhalt initially predicted she would leave the hospital just a few days after the surgery. Gabor's fall happened as she reached to answer the phone while watching the television game show ""Jeopardy,"" which is ""a must-see show"" for the actress, her husband said. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, he said. The crash occurred when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge;"" ""The Story of Three Loves,"" 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin,"" 1957; and Orson Welles' classic ""Touch of Evil,"" 1958. In 1989, Gabor was sentenced to 72 hours in jail for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer after a traffic stop. She also had to perform community service at a battered women's shelter. The other Gabor sisters were Magda, the oldest, who died in 1997 five days shy of 83, and Eva, the youngest, who died in 1995 at 76. Magda, an occasional stage actress, also was married to Sanders at one time. Eva is probably best remembered for her role as a socialite turned farmer's wife on the 1960s TV sitcom ""Green Acres.""","Gabor's daughter says her mom is eating and watching TV .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- She is one of the world's most likeable and photogenic leaders, has her own YouTube channel, and is determined to change the face of learning in the Middle East. Queen Rania's down-to-earth personality has won hearts and minds all over the world. She is also, according to you, the most inspirational leader featured on CNN's ""The Spirit of..."" in 2008. Thousands of CNN Web site users voted to award her the honor for her matchless energy working with Jordan's young people, ahead of luminaries such as peace advocate Kofi Annan, activist Wangari Maathai and environmentalist James Lovelock. This is Queen Rania's second award in as many months. In November, she was presented with the first ever YouTube Visionary Award for her bold use of the video-sharing network to discuss stereotypes about Islam and the Arab world. The channel fielded questions from young people about all aspects of Islamic culture. She could not be present to personally receive the honour at YouTube's Live event in San Francisco, but her pop-culture-savvy pre-recorded acceptance speech showed her to be possibly the coolest queen alive. She delighted viewers with a lighthearted top-ten list of reasons for registering her own YouTube channel, which included, ""Because I didn't have enough friends on Facebook,"" and ""Because anything Queen Elizabeth can do I can do better."" The experimental venture gained her a faithful online following, and since then the channel has become a platform for entertaining, non-hostile debate. It is exactly this willingness to set aside her royal image and interact with the public that her fans say has shown Queen Rania's dedication to bringing about change. She first entered the international spotlight 15 years ago after marrying Abdullah II bin al-Hussein, the then future king of Jordan. In 1999, she was proclaimed Queen, the world's youngest at age 28. She wasted little time in applying herself to various causes, and soon made her name as an engaging advocate for women's rights and moderate Islam, and as a heavy investor in youth. The 38-year-old mother of four has said that she cares about her people as if they were her own children, and wants to ensure as many of them as possible get the most out of school. Queen Rania may be light-hearted in some of her approaches, but she is very serious when it comes to revitalizing education in the Middle East. She has made closing the Middle East's ""knowledge divide"" -- the gap in knowledge that has grown as a result of people in richer countries having more access to computers, the Internet and education than those in poorer countries -- a top priority over the next few years in the hope that it will unlock the economic potential of the region's population. Queen Rania certainly has a challenge on her hands. Earlier this year, the Arab League Educational Cultural and Scientific Organisation revealed that nearly one in three between the ages of 15 and 45 is illiterate. Alongside promoting equal rights for men and women and the importance of literacy, Queen Rania has strived to convince both the education and private sectors that existing education systems need reinvigoration. She has repeatedly called for creative instruction and explorative learning to be embraced in the classroom. In April of this year, Queen Rania launched the Madrasati (""My School"") project, which encourages Jordanians to get their neediest schools back on their feet. Under the program, communities are working with the public and private sectors to raise funds and recruit volunteers to renovate school facilities and provide school supplies and equipment. This is expected to improve the learning environment for children, and ultimately have a ripple effect on the neighborhoods where the schools are located. Queen Rania's campaigns in various areas have helped to inspire other Middle Eastern policy-makers to see globalization in a more positive light -- a truly inspiring leader.","Queen Rania voted ""The Spirit of..."" most inspirational leader of 2008 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Is it possible to have a building that can make you happy, sad, or even angry? The Experience Music Project in Seattle has appeared in the Forbes list of ugly buildings. Does it affect your mood? Alain de Botton thinks it is. The Swiss-born British writer, modern-day philosopher, and author of international bestseller ""The Architecture of Happiness"", believes there is more to buildings and architecture than we may think. Taking on 19th Century French writer Stendhal's motto that ""beauty is the promise of happiness,"" de Botton analyzes human surroundings and considers how our needs and desires are transferred into architecture. He also discusses the amount to which architecture can affect our personal happiness. De Botton told CNN he felt that a beautiful building, or likewise, an ugly structure, could affect how we feel. ""Beauty has a huge role to play in altering our mood. When we call a chair or a house beautiful, really what we're saying is that we like the way of life it's suggesting to us. It has an attitude we're attracted to: if it was magically turned into a person, we'd like who it was. ""It would be convenient if we could remain in much the same mood wherever we happened to be ...but unfortunately we're highly vulnerable to the coded messages that emanate from our surroundings,"" he said. But, how do buildings manage to cast their bricks and mortar over our emotions? ""One might say that architecture suggests a mood to us, which we may be too internally troubled to be able to take up. Its effectiveness could be compared to the weather: a fine day can substantially change our state of mind -- and people may be willing to make great sacrifices to be nearer a sunny climate,"" de Botton said. De Botton believed that structures communicate with us in various ways. ""This book focuses our minds on the idea that buildings speak -- and on topics which can readily be discerned. They speak of democracy or aristocracy, openness or arrogance, welcome or threat, a sympathy for the future or a hankering for the past."" So, indeed your own house could be making you happy or sad, de Botton suggests. ""They (houses) tell us of certain moods that they seek to encourage and sustain in their inhabitants. While keeping us warm and helping us in mechanical ways, they simultaneously hold out an invitation for us to be specific sorts of people. They speak of particular visions of happiness,"" he said. De Botton said there are ""thousands"" of public buildings which are ugly and could possibly force a negative, saddening, or even potential anger-producing mood upon us. What are some examples? De Botton is quick to mention the new Westfield mall opening in Shepherd's Bush, London, which he describes as a ""monument to human idiocy"" which represents a ""large, confused shed, which offers the wider community nothing but a windowless façade clad in nauseating green paneling, with an utter indifference to symmetry, proportion or beauty"". And what other buildings could be considered a structure of sadness? Certainly, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Experience Music Project building in Seattle has to be a nominee -- featuring in the Forbes list of the top ten ugliest buildings in the world. Elsewhere, London's Millennium Dome (or 02 Arena) and Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, are other well-known candidates for buildings that could destroy one's day, after featuring in various ""ugly"" lists. At the other end of the scale, de Botton has some ideas about structures we should cast our eyes upon to make us happy. While all of this is rather subjective, de Botton said there were some aesthetic values that were universally appreciated. He was particularly fond of the highly-detailed yet serene Senate House in Bloomsbury, London, and also the Georgian-style architecture of Bedford Square, also in London. It's fair to say though, that not everyone in the architectural world is as optimistic about the power of architecture over people. In a debate with architect Robert Adam organized by building.co.uk, Adam attacked de Botton's ideas. After questioning de Botton's use of the word ""us"" when presenting some opinions, Adam said he did not believe that people were culturally aware enough to take notice of such details. ""I wouldn't call myself a pessimist because it would mean I feel bad about popular culture, which I don't. What I think we have at the moment is people who are unprepared to take on the language of the greater part of the population,"" he said. We want to know what you think.

"Washington (CNN) -- The unsolved murder of human rights activists in Russia. Their detention, torture and murder in Iran. Their jailing in China and Vietnam. Attacks on journalists in the Philippines, Pakistan, Mexico and Somalia. Coups in Africa and Central America. All isolated incidents around the world that together made 2009 a grim milestone in world freedom, according to a United States think tank that tracks liberty around the globe. Declines in freedom around the world outweighed gains last year, for the fourth year in a row, Freedom House says in its annual survey published Tuesday. ""This represents the longest continuous period of deterioration in the nearly 40-year history"" of the report, writes this year's author, Arch Puddington. There were only 116 electoral democracies around the world in 2009, the group found -- the lowest number since 1995. But the world is doing relatively well at democratic elections, compared with some other indicators. ""Governments are more likely to permit relatively honest elections than to allow an uncensored press, a robust civil society, and an independent judiciary,"" Puddington writes. The report is not all doom and gloom. There was progress in Iraq, the Balkans, Malawi and Togo, Freedom House said. And taking the long view, the world was more free in 2009 than when revolutions swept the communist world 20 years earlier. The Central and Eastern European democracies born in 1989 have largely retained their freedom, despite economic pressures stemming from the worldwide recession. But much of the former Soviet Union is in a dire state. Central Asia is the least free region in the world, according to Freedom House, and contains two of the nine countries that got the survey's ""worst of the worst"" rating. Central Asia's former Soviet republics of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are on that list, along with North Korea, Libya, Sudan, Myanmar (also known as Burma), Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea and Somalia. Ten other countries and territories fared only slightly better. They are Belarus, Chad, China, Cuba, Guinea, Laos, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia, and Western Sahara, which is fighting for independence from Morocco. Freedom House groups countries into three categories: free, partly free and not free. A total of 89 countries were rated free in 2009. That's 46 percent of the 194 countries and territories in the survey, representing 46 percent of the world's population. Freedom House listed 58 countries as partly free. That's 30 percent of the world's countries, with 20 percent of the global population. The group said 47 countries were not free -- just under one in four of the countries in the world, but just over one in three of the world's people. China is home to more than half the people in the ""not free"" category, Freedom House said. Freedom House describes itself as a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that supports democratic change, monitors freedom, and advocates for democracy and human rights. It has been publishing its annual report since 1972.","Freedom declines outweighed gains in '09, Freedom House says in annual survey .

"(The Frisky) -- When I first heard that a show was premiering on MTV called ""World of Jenks,"" I assumed that it would A) be about a group of guys who like to punch each other in the privates à la ""Jackass"" or B) star a stuffed monkey à la ""Warren the Ape."" Luckily, neither is the case. Instead, ""World of Jenks"" is something MTV, despite its usual flash and pop, is really amazing at creating: documentary television. So who is Jenks? The Frisky: James Franco would tell you if he was gay . Andrew Jenks is a 24-year-old documentary filmmaker who first got attention when he was a sophomore at NYU for his film ""Andrew Jenks, Room 335."" In his movie, Jenks moves into a retirement community. The New York Post raved at the time, 'It's almost impossible to believe that a kid could produce a documentary like this. It's a gorgeous, hilarious, sad, wonderful, unblinking look at the joy of life -- even at the end of it."" The Frisky: Book claims Lady Gaga had eating disorder, affair . Next, Jenks made a movie called ""The Zen of Bobby V,"" about the Mets former manager Bobby Valentine who's moved on to managing baseball in Japan, for ESPN Films. In each episode of the new ""World of Jenks"" on MTV, Jenks will spend a week with a person who lives a unique life -- be it a homeless woman, an NFL cheerleader, rapper Maino, a mixed martial artist, an army recruit, or a teen with autism. And I'm not just excited about the show because Jenks is adorable in that floppy-haired, long-nosed Andy Samberg/Daniel Vosovic of ""Project Runway"" way. The Frisky: Plus-size actress Gabby Sidibe gets cover of ""Elle"" magazine . As a journalist who reads 98 percent non-fiction, fascinating people and hidden subcultures always intrigue me. Especially when they're reported on in an honest, sympathetic way. Which Jenks can obviously do. He says about his new show, ""Every episode is about really trying to understand that person's entire story. Once you are really with someone the entire time for a few days, you start to really get who they are."" Amen to that. MTV documentary shows are generally outstanding. ""True Life"" is one of the most underrated series on TV, and I'm happy that ""Teen Mom"" is finally attracting a lot of attention-and a zillion tabloid covers.

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- The elderly parents of Elizabeth Smart's accused kidnapper testified Wednesday that he was a troubled boy who grew increasingly self-absorbed as a man. ""Brian's a very intelligent person and used that to its full extent in the harassment of the other children and my wife,"" said Shirl Mitchell, the defendant's father. The elderly witness made his way through the courtroom with a walker, apologizing for being some 30 minutes late because his taxi driver dropped him off outside the wrong courthouse. The testimony Wednesday painted a picture of a troubled family history, and a Brian David Mitchell who alienated his parents as a boy and shunned his own children as an adult. Mitchell faces a federal kidnapping charge for abducting Smart in 2002 and holding her for nine months. Smart, now 23, testified earlier in the week that Mitchell told her she was divinely selected to be his wife, kept her tethered to trees in a mountain camp, and raped her repeatedly during the ordeal. He could face life in prison if convicted. In his opening statement, defense attorney Parker Douglas described his client's life as mirroring his father's in many ways, including unusual and fervent religious beliefs, but he noted that Shirl Mitchell was never formally diagnosed with a mental illness. During his testimony Wednesday, the elder Mitchell said his son had been troubled since ""in the womb,"" and was conceived under ""unfortunate psychological circumstances for me and my wife."" He was asked whether he had a special connection to his son. ""I didn't have too much connection, maybe that's the trouble,"" he replied. ""He sort of alienated himself, isolated himself, in his own little world, you know. He wasn't very responsive to me."" The father also testified about a time when Brian was 9 or 10, when his father dropped him off in a city park in an effort to teach him a lesson. ""I said, 'Now you're going to find your way home, and see how it is to be on your own.'"" His son was gone until nightfall, he said. He'd made money taking photographs for Japanese tourists, and used his earnings to go to a double feature at the movies. ""This is typical of Brian. He's smart; 'I'm going to make them worry about me, I'll just stay away all day,' and he did,"" his father testified. Irene Mitchell, the defendant's mother, testified only  briefly Wednesday afternoon. She struggled with many  questions, saying she's in the process of  losing her memory. ""I remember my son as a little boy,""  she said, ""and what he is now is not the same person."" She said his behavior toward her became so frightening that she obtained a protective order. During cross examination, she was asked  to read from a letter from her son during the time his appearance changed. ""My  hair and beard are part of a new act. Sorry I can't be a sweet-looking boy all  the time,"" the letter reads. A sister of Mitchell's, Kayleen Hill, testified that her brother appeared to blame his own children for his lack of accomplishment, and told her they were undeserving of his love. Mitchell eventually put the children from his first marriage, Travis and Angela, up for adoption, while preventing his own family members from adopting or having contact with them, according to testimony Wednesday. Hill said she'd been encouraged for a time when her brother became active in the Church of Latter-day Saints and appeared to live a healthier lifestyle than he had before. While married to Wanda Barzee, however, he once again began to isolate himself from the family and became increasingly narcissistic. ""Once he started doing his wanderings with Wanda, especially, he became very distant,"" she said. ""He would kind of be looking down on other people. He felt that he had a special connection with God."" Prosecutors have held that Mitchell is not  sincere in his professed religious beliefs, and is a masterful manipulator. Defense attorneys so far have called 10 witnesses over two days, including Mitchell's parents, two of his sisters and several friends. They hope to show that Mitchell was so mentally ill when he snatched the Salt Lake City teen that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. Their case could include testimony by Mitchell himself, as well as his wife, Barzee, who is serving up to 15 years in prison as part of a plea deal with prosecutors that hinges on her willingness to testify against Mitchell. Barzee was not called to the stand in the government's case, but appears on the defense's witness list.","Brian David Mitchell was a troubled child who grew distant from family, his father testifies .

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal says 2010 has been a dream year so far, after the Spaniard recovered from a knee injury in 2009 to reclaim his French Open and Wimbledon crowns, and the world number one ranking. ""It's just amazing for me you know, more than dream because I was 11 months without winning a tournament, so that wasn't an easy time for me,"" he told CNN's Open Court. The 24-year-old said he was so happy with his success as he was not sure if he would ever return to the top of tennis after his knee problems forced him out of the sport last year. After being knocked out in the fourth round of the 2009 French Open by Sweden's Robin Soderling, preventing him from winning a fifth consecutive title in Paris, Nadal's ongoing knee problem also stopped him from competing and defending his title at Wimbledon. Home hopes distant ahead of U.S. Open . ""It was a hard month after that retirement from Wimbledon. It was probably one of the hardest months of my career,"" he said. ""I worked very hard to build my level but I have doubts and at moments I didn't know if I'm going to be another time at my best."" Nadal's injury worries also coincided with problems off the court, as he struggled to come to terms with his parents' divorce. However, he refuses to blame any of his losses on his family situation. ""It wasn't an easy moment for me, but it happened very often these moments for everybody so just accept that and accept the change. ""I always suffer for my mum, for my dad, for my sisters, so that makes me think more than things on tennis but it's not for that reason I lost the matches."" In fact, Nadal, who is coached by his uncle Toni and still lives on his home island of Majorca surrounded by relatives, credits his close-knit family for his happiness and for keeping him grounded. ""The family is very important. They make me feel good always because if I won, when I started to be famous the relationship never changed with my friends and family,"" the eight-time grand slam champion said. ""I am very lucky because when I come back home I have a completely normal life. I can relax, playing golf, fishing -- doing what I want. I know when I finish a tournament, I am going to relax at home."" But even though he is happiest at home with his family, Nadal admits that he copes with the attention he receives being the world's best tennis player much better now than he did at the start of his career. ""I was shy when I was a kid, I was very shy, but now I think I've improved a lot. ""I can speak ok with the media and with the people. My English is still bad but I feel a little bit better now than before.""","Rafael Nadal speaks exclusively to CNN's Open Court .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A veteran of over 20 years of mountain climbing, Dave Bunting has been in some pretty tight scrapes. Soldier mountaineer Dave Bunting on Mount Everest. His team tried to summit via the mountain's notorious West Ridge in 2006. He and his climbing partner once watched in terror as a huge avalanche careered down a Himalayan mountainside straight for them. They were miraculously spared when the wall of snow parted on either side of the promontory where they were standing at a distance of just 50 meters. On another occasion he spent an agonizing night hanging precariously over a 3,000-foot (900 meter) drop during an electrical storm in the Alps. He estimates he was electrocuted ""half a dozen times"" during the course of the night. Faced with the fearsome power of nature mountaineers like Bunting rely on one indispensable ally -- other mountaineers. Teamwork is essential in climbing. The first successful ascent of Everest was as much about the bond of trust that existed between modest New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and his diminutive Sherpa, Tenzing Norgay, as their individual talents. To illustrate this point, when Bunting -- a warrant officer in the British Army -- was compiling a team of soldiers to attempt an ascent of Everest's notorious West Ridge the first quality he and the rest of the selection panel looked for was not climbing expertise, but compatibility. ""A lot of people think that when you go and do something like that, you immediately look for all the best climbers in the army,"" he says. ""But what we based our selection process on, compatibility was first."" Of course, all team sports rely upon a strong dynamic between the individual members. But there can be few disciplines in which the stakes are as high as in mountain climbing, where your life often literally rests in someone else's hands. Bunting, 40, led the expedition of 21 army mountaineers to Everest's West Ridge two years ago. It was a daunting undertaking. Of over 2,200 climbers who have made it to the top of the world's tallest peak since it was first conquered, only 19 have done so via this route. The ridge is rarely attempted because of its steepness and because its position leaves it exposed to high winds and the risk of avalanche. The army's summit attempt took three and half years in the planning and preparation and was the subject of a documentary, 'Everest: Man v Mountain.' Much of this build-up involved establishing strong bonds between team members. Practice climbs, social events and corporate-style teambuilding days were all employed to try to instil an atmosphere of mutual trust within the group. An essential factor on a mountain as significant as Everest, Bunting says. ""You are massively wrapped up in emotions there because you've spent three and a half years preparing for it,"" says Bunting, who now runs his own outdoor events company in the Bavarian Alps. The prestige of getting to the top of Everest can sometimes blur a climber's moral judgement, leading to acts of single-mindedness that border on the downright callous. During the same season as Bunting's army expedition, David Sharp, a 34-year-old British climber died of cold, exhaustion and lack of oxygen on his descent from the summit. As details of Sharp's death became public it emerged that 40 climbers had passed him, making no attempt to save the stricken climber as he lay stranded in the scant shelter of a rock alcove on the mountain's northeast ridge. The incident drew much soul-searching in the mountaineering world, with Sir Edmund Hillary complaining to New Zealand's Otago Daily Times of the ""horrifying"" attitudes it revealed. ""(On Everest) a lot of people are out for themselves completely,"" says Bunting. He says this selfish streak is exacerbated by the fast turnover of commercial climbing expeditions, which often meet for the first time just a couple of weeks before a summit attempt, meaning there is little opportunity to build team morale. By contrast, among Bunting's army mountaineers the needs of the group were always put before personal ambition. He gives an example: . ""As we went for the summit there were a number of support teams, one of whose job it was to break trail from base camp right the way up to 7,500 metres, clambering through two foot of snow. ""Each step you take at those altitudes is absolutely horrendous. There's a clip in the documentary of one of the lads breaking trail, every step up to his knees in snow, and you hear him say: 'Well, this is our job so we've got to get on with it.' ""A brilliant demonstration of teamwork."" The biggest test of this togetherness came when Bunting was left the unenviable task of telling his team of ambitious young soldiers he was abandoning the summit attempt because of a high risk of avalanches. ""Two or three of the guys were pretty pissed off, to be honest. ""Instead of getting wrapped up in emotions -- because Everest is a very emotional place -- I looked at it in very black and white terms. I couldn't risk sending my team up the mountain with that kind of real and present danger involved."" This clear-headed thinking meant his team braved one of the most dangerous climbs in the world and made it back down again, together.","Army officer Dave Bunting recruited a team of 21 soldiers to summit Everest .
The 2006 attempt was via the mountain's notoriously dangerous West Ridge .

"(CNN) -- For 25 agonizing minutes, journalist Norm Beaman did not know whether his wife had perished in wild fires sweeping southern Australia, after he lost mobile phone contact following an explosion and a scream. Firefighters battle a blaze in Labertouche, about 125 kilometers west of Melbourne. Beaman, a veteran reporter for Channel 7 news, was racing home to his property on Mount Disappointment, north of Melbourne, talking to his wife, Annie, as she tried to defend their home from the fires that have left dozens dead. ""She was being stoic, putting up a fight, but when the hay and machinery shed next to our house exploded, she frantically screamed: 'I'm jumping in the dam,' and that was the last I heard of her for 25 minutes,"" he told CNN.

Beaman said he eventually made it through to his home after persuading officers manning the roadblock to turn a blind eye. ""I eventually pleaded on humanitarian grounds in fairly direct terms with a policeman and asked him to turn his back for 30 seconds and he did and I got through,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 700 people in a small town within Lagos, Nigeria, will be moved to a relief camp due to heavy flooding that has plagued the region since September, according to a state governor. Babatunde Raji Fashola made the announcement Monday while on a tour of flood-impacted areas. In all, 681 people from the town of Ajegunle will be relocated to camps specially built for relief efforts, he said. The flooding began last month when the Ogun River rose above its banks after the opening of a dam. No casualties have been reported. While speaking to affected residents, Fashola emphasized that the area is in a flood plain and that people must be ready to move. He said that the government alone can't solve the problem and they need help from everyone in the area to get through the flooding and limit the damage, asking residents to refrain from using flood-stricken roads. ""We have to wait for this water to subside,"" Fashola said. ""Nature will take its course, but what we can do as a people is work together to mitigate the advanced consequences.""

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- The son of a Philippines provincial governor is voluntarily turning himself in for questioning in the massacre of at least 57 unarmed civilians, a CNN affiliate reported Thursday. Andal Ampatuan Jr. -- who is the mayor of Datu Unsay and the son of Maguindanao Governor Andal Ampatuan -- has agreed to face questioning, reported Patricia Evangelista of ABS-CBN. Ampatuan was not identified by authorities as a suspect in the killings in the southern Philippines, though victims' survivors and local media reports had done so. Philippines President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ""is enraged by these barbaric acts,"" spokesman Cerge Remonde said. ""She has literally thrown the full force of the law and has mobilized the security and police forces of the state to go after the perpetrators."" Philippines authorities had disbanded a paramilitary force in the southern Philippines suspected of playing a role in the massacre, the country's state-run media reported Wednesday. Remonde said the deaths were the result of a political clan war, not Muslim secessionism in that troubled region of the country. ""So far as this case is concerned, this is a limited clan political rivalry, which has been going on for some time now,"" Remonde said. The death toll grew Wednesday after 11 more bodies were recovered from a rural area of Mindanao and buried. Arroyo has declared Wednesday a national day of mourning. Arroyo's government is under intense pressure to find those responsible for planning and carrying out the abduction and killing of the group of about 60 politicians, lawyers and journalists -- and reportedly some bystanders. Suspicion has fallen on the Ampatuan family, key allies of the Arroyo administration in the Maguindanao region of the southern Mindanao province. Ampatuan family members have not commented on the slaying allegations. Remonde appeared to blame the Ampatuan clan, adding: ""There is, however, a move now by the administration party to expel the suspected clan."" Those killed include the wife and two sisters of a local politician who plans to run for the spot vacated next year by Maguindanao's governor, Andal Ampatuan. While the investigation is ongoing, a spokesman for the country's national police has said that Andal Ampatuan Jr. has been linked to the crime, according to local media reports. ""According to the initial reports, those who were abducted and murdered at Saniag were initially stopped by a group led by the mayor of Datu Unsay,"" National Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Leonardo Espina said, according to ABS-CBN News. The massacre is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippines history. On Monday morning, in daylight, a group of about 100 gunmen stopped a convoy carrying supporters and family members of local politician Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, witnesses and officials say. Mangudadatu had sent his wife and sisters to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao in May after he had been threatened and told not to file the papers himself. He said the threats came from allies of Governor Ampatuan. The number of people kidnapped and killed was still unclear, as recovery continued at the mass grave site in Maguindanao. A car traveling behind the convoy was mistaken for being a part of the politician's contingent, a local official told the Philippines GMA News Network. The car was instead heading to a hospital, according to Tom Robles, head of the Tacurong City Employees Union, who spoke to GMA News. The driver and four passengers -- including a government employee who had suffered a mild stroke and his wife -- were rounded up and killed along with the members of the convoy ahead of them, Robles said. A police official confirmed that the car and the bodies of three of the passengers were among those recovered at the grave site, GMA reported. The state-run Philippines News Agency said the ruling Lakas-Kampi-CMD (Christian, Muslim, Democrats) was to meet Wednesday to discuss whether to remove the Ampatuan clan members in Mindanao from the party as a result of the killings. ""In our opinion, they were not able to fulfill their obligations to the party,"" said former Defense Secretary Gilberto ""Gibo"" Teodoro, Lakas-Kampi-CMD national president and the party's standard bearer in the 2010 elections, in a radio interview, according to PNA. Ampatuans hold leadership positions in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, including governor of the region, governor of Maguindanao and mayor of Datu Unsay. ""Like many others, I am appalled and outraged by it, and I join the rising chorus of indignation against it,"" Arroyo said. ""This is not a simple election feud between opposing clans; this is a supreme act of inhumanity that is a blight on our nation. The perpetrators will not escape justice. The law will haunt them until they are caught.""","NEW: Authorities did not identify Ampatuan as a suspect .

"(CNN) -- Mercedes-Benz will head up their own Formula One team next season after the German car manufacturer confirmed they have taken a 75.1 percent share in Brawn GP -- with Ross Brawn remaining as team principal. Mercedes engines powered Brawn's Jenson Button to the world championship this season -- while the team also claimed the constructors' championship. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton, Button's predecessor as world champion, was also sitting behind a Mercedes engine in his McLaren. The partnership between McLaren and Mercedes has been in place since 1995 and ended its 15th season together in 2009. The new team will become known as Mercedes Grand Prix, with Brawn in control, while Mercedes-Benz Motorsport vice-president Norbert Haug will work with the F1 team and the engine team of Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines. As part of the deal, Mercedes' parent company Daimler AG relinquished their 40 per cent stake in McLaren, but will remain their engine suppliers for the next six seasons. Daimler AG chief executive Dr. Dieter Zetsche explained in a press release: ""Mercedes-Benz is the most valued and best-known premium automotive brand in the world. ""This brand looks for competition of the utmost quality in all relevant fields in order to continually improve its performance in the face of such new challenges. ""Due to the new Formula One environment, we will face the competition in future on the most important motor sports stage with our own Silver Arrow works team. ""Our new Silver Arrow Formula One team is a great sporting and technical chal-lenge and we will tackle this with sporting spirit and full of enthusiasm."" The move could have ramifications for the out-of-contract Button, with Mercedes believed to favor an all-German partnership of Nico Rosberg and Nick Hiedfeld. Such a move could see Button link up with Hamilton at McLaren and the 29-year-old was believed to have toured McLaren's Woking factory last week. Brawn, who has previously baulked at meeting Button's wage demands, was thrilled with the deal after forming Brawn GP following the withdrawal of Honda from the sport.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Former ""Survivor"" producer Bruce Beresford-Redman, accused of killing his wife, will stay behind bars at least another 12 days when a federal judge will hear his argument for bail. Beresford-Redman was taken into custody by U.S. marshals in Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon on a warrant from Mexico, the U.S. attorney's spokesman said. U.S. Magistrate Suzanne Segal set  November 29 as the date for his bail hearing, but his defense lawyer acknowledged getting him out while he waits for a decision on his extradition will not be easy. ""We know we have an uphill battle, but we think we have enough evidence to convince a judge to do so,"" defense attorney Richard Hirsch said. An ""aggravated homicide"" warrant, unsealed Tuesday, accused Beresford-Redman of killing his wife, Monica Beresford-Redman, ""by asphyxiating her"" at a Cancun, Mexico, resort on April 5. Beresford-Redman was arrested without incident at his Rancho Palos Verdes home, officials said. Monica Beresford-Redman's sister, Jeanne Burgos, was in court when her former brother-in-law was brought before the judge in a Los Angeles federal courtroom.  She said it was a sad moment. ""There is just a hope to go where we need to go so justice is served, but really there is no happy ending here,"" Burgos said. Beresford-Redman's lawyer predicted it could take a year before a decision is made by U.S. courts about Mexico's request for extradition. ""We believe we have sufficient evidence to raise a doubt in the judge's as to whether our client is responsible for this crime,"" Hirsch said. The couple and their two young children were staying at the Moon Palace Resort. Monica Beresford-Redman's body was found in a resort sewer on April 8. The initial investigation suggested she ""died of strangulation, because of the bruising,"" Mexican regional police spokesman Adrian Cardena said. The extradition request cited as evidence several witness statements, including one from two British teenagers who were in the hotel room below where the Beresford-Redmans were staying. The boys wrote that they were awakened by ""screams, crying for help and extremely loud banging from the room above"" at 6 a.m. on April 5.  ""It sounded like a woman in extreme distress"" and lasted for 15 minutes, their statement said. The document, which used her maiden name, said the couple ""had been having marital troubles for some time before her murder."" ""The marital problems continued in Cancun,"" it said. ""In a conversation from Cancun on April 4, 2010, Monica Burgos told her sister, Ferreira Burgos, that she had found evidence that [Beresford-Redman] was still in contact with the woman with whom he was having the affair."" Bruce Beresford-Redman was charged with his wife's slaying in May and an extradition request from Mexico was delivered to the U.S. government in June. The arrest was delayed when his lawyers in Mexico filed an ""amparo"" with a federal court in Mexico City, a document arguing there is not probable cause to charge him, a defense lawyer said. Hirsch, in a summer CNN interview, accused the state judge in Mexico of ""a rush to judgment"" in charging Beresford-Redman, saying, ""It appears that this case is being handled in a manner outside the normal procedures in Mexico."" The producer was briefly detained by police in Mexico after his wife's body was found in April. His passport was taken by investigators, and he was told not to leave Mexico until the inquiry was concluded. Beresford-Redman returned home in May, without the knowledge of investigators, to take care of family business and see his children, his lawyer said. He has lived in his Rancho Palos Verdes home with his children since May, although his parents have temporary legal custody of the children, ages 3 and 5. Bruce Beresford-Redman built his career as a Hollywood reality television show producer. He worked for several seasons on the popular CBS show ""Survivor,"" in which contestants compete against each other in a variety of extreme outdoor scenarios. He was nominated for three Emmy Awards as a producer on the show and was last credited as a producer in 2004. He also worked on NBC's ""The Contender"" and ""The Restaurant,"" as well as MTV's ""Pimp My Ride,"" according to entertainment media company IMG.

"(CNN) -- Seven NATO troops died after attacks in Afghanistan on Sunday, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said. Five troops died following an insurgent attack in eastern Afghanistan, ISAF said, though it did not provide details about the attack. Another ISAF service member died following an improvised explosive device attack in southern Afghanistan, ISAF said Sunday, after earlier announcing the death of another servicemember in an IED attack in the southern part of the country. It was not clear whether those two troops died as a result of the same attack. Sunday marked the deadliest day for NATO forces in Afghanistan since October 14, when 7 NATO troops were killed. There have been 34 coalition casualties in Afghanistan so far this month, according to a CNN count. ISAF did not disclose the identifies of the service members killed, citing its policy of deferring casualty identification procedures to relevant national authorities. But the British defense ministry said in a statement Sunday that one of its soldiers died Sunday in southern Afghanistan. The soldier was assigned to 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment and was serving as part of Combined Force Nad'e Ali (South), according to the statement. The soldier died in an improvised explosive device attack in the southern Nad'e Ali area of Helmand Province. The soldier was part of a security patrol, Task Force Helmand spokesman Lt. Col. David Eastman said in a statement. Next of kin have been informed, Britain's Ministry of Defence said.","Troops killed in insurgent attacks, NATO says .

"(CNN) -- Few people can forget the moment quake victim Anna Zizi, 69, was dragged from the rubble, singing at the top of her voice, her face caked in dirt and debris. Amidst the heartache and anguish brought by the devastating earthquake, music has proved a source of comfort for Haitians at home and abroad. Those living in France, in particular, say the sounds of kompa help bring their hearts closer to home and soothe their souls. ""For Haitian people, kompa music is like a cure. It helps us to forget stress and the bad times in life,"" said Original H, a popular Haitian kompa group in Paris, in a statement emailed to CNN. ""Even in the saddest moments Haitian people always sing. Haitian people always laugh. Their hearts hurt, but they really want to continue to live,"" said Michel Marchand, presenter of ""Kompa Boulevard,"" a program on France-based Radio Espace FM. Kompa musician Mikael Guirand of the celebrated band Carimi felt the power of his music first-hand. Guirand was in a meeting in the Digicel tower in Port-au-Prince, the country's tallest building, when the quake struck. He made it out unharmed, but his family's home and his father's business were both destroyed. Despite the overwhelming despair that followed, Guirand told CNN that devastated fans threw their arms around him in the streets, overjoyed to see musicians like him had survived. ""To have people with no home crying to see that we made it alive is insane,"" Guirand said. ""That shows how highly they value the music...it gives them hope."" In France, kompa musicians are now rallying for their homeland and performing in charity concerts. ""Since the tragedy we've participated in several events and projects to raise funds including 'A Gesture for Haiti',"" said Original H. That event brought together leading French artists, including renowned singer Charles Aznavour, to produce a special song and music video. ""We have all family and friends in Haiti, and most of us have lost someone. It is an unforgettable disaster and sometimes we feel helpless for our nation,"" Original H told CNN. Radio Espace and KompaParis.com, a Web site dedicated to kompa, are now helping lead the way organizing and promoting several festivals in France. In the days after the earthquake both groups also used their sites and broadcasts to help Haitians in France find family back home. The popularity of kompa music in France bodes well for the success of these upcoming events. Radio host Marchand thinks one of the key reasons is because of kompa's exuberant, live performances. ""Kompa is very popular in France,"" he said. ""It's because Haitian people play live music, not just in a studio, or to sell it on a shelf."" Kompa music is considered an integral part of Haitian culture, first emerging on the Caribbean island about 60 years ago, distinguishing itself from the Dominican Republic's brand of merengue, both in spelling and in style. The Haitian meringue is nearly identical to the Dominican merengue but it is a slower tempo and is usually performed in a minor key. Fans describe it as a jazz derivative with pulsing beats, twisting rhythms and soulful Creole singing. ""Kompa is a genre of Haitian music invented by saxophonist Jean-Baptiste Nemours, derived from the meringue and close to calypso,"" explained Vanessa Francklin of KompaParis.com. ""Kompa wants to be open, warm and festive. [It has] bold brass, heavy bass, very inspired guitars, keyboards and percussion sounds with fire,"" she continued. ""The music is honest, vibrant, and has things to say. This is the music of a people that has long suffered and still suffers,"" she finished. As Kompa's profile grows worldwide, many of its musicians are hoping it will not only now help raise funds, but cast Haiti in a more positive light. Bands are also writing special songs dedicated to disaster relief, including Tabou Combo, one of the more famous kompa bands in Haiti, their new song is called ""Haiti Will Never Die."" ""A lot of people are getting to know who we are as Haitians through our music,"" added Guirand. ""We are not only miserable as you see on TV. Our music shows we are rich in culture.""

"(CNN) -- The sculptures speak for themselves: Piñatas in the shape of decapitated heads bearing gunshot wounds adorn the walls of El Paso's Public Library in Texas. Artist Abel Saucedo says the exhibit, ""Ciudad Juarez es the .1"" has drawn mixed emotions from viewers. The exhibit, called ""Ciudad Juarez es the .1,"" is the work of local artist Abel Saucedo, 24, a recent arts graduate of the University of Texas in El Paso. Saucedo grew up in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez across the border in Mexico, and says violence is now a normal part of life on the border. ""Every time you have a conversation here violence is brought up. It's on the front page, it's part of everyone's life, it's a reality. I decided to use a piñata because it's a way to identify with my culture,"" Saucedo said in a phone interview. The collection, which Saucedo describes as post modern conceptualism, contains four individual piñata sculptures in the shape of cartoon heads a bit larger than life size. The heads look as if they have been severed at the bottom of the neck and they are adorned with red paint and shot wounds on the forehead. They are all men -- one has glasses, one a golden tooth, one is smiling, and one has a mustache. ""They don't represent anyone in particular, just the violence in the border,"" Saucedo said. ""I got a pressure gun and shot each piñata so it would look like a gunshot. I also filled the pressure gun with red paint so it would drip down the face,"" Saucedo said. The pieces, which took Saucedo six months to complete, were received with mixed emotions. ""I have had all kinds of responses. People like them, they think it's a great idea. People think its offensive, sad, it's humorous, but people say it's the truth. In art I've learned that everything everyone says, it's an opinion,"" said Saucedo. El Paso Library spokesman Jack Galindo said the library had only one official complaint -- a man said he was ""very offended"" by the pieces. The library receives around 1,592 visitors per day. ""As a person living here in the community, as an artist, this is my opportunity to speak, and it's tragic. My family and friends have had to move, it's tragic. I feel it's my responsibility as an artist to represent those feelings,"" said Saucedo. Enrique Torres, spokesman for the Mexican state of Chihuahua's Joint Operation said the violence is as brutal as ever. ""We have anything from one dead a day to six or seven. Criminal groups have changed their strategy. They used to operate in high profile vehicles and large caliber weapons, now they use low caliber weapons and older model compact vehicles which are harder to detect,"" said Torres. Chihuahua's Joint Operation oversees 7,000 Mexican soldiers operating in Juarez working alongside 2,300 federal Police and local police forces. ""Ciudad Juarez es the .1"" will run until July 31.","Artist says piñatas in shape of decapitated heads represent border violence .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- The father of a 2-year-old Florida boy has admitted to the near-fatal beating of his son while teaching the child how to box, officials said Wednesday. Lee Willie Dejesus, 23, of Homestead was arrested Tuesday and charged with aggravated child abuse and child neglect, according to the criminal complaint against him. Miami-Dade police said the incident occurred Monday night when Dejesus was watching the child while his mother was at work. Dejesus told police that he put on boxing gloves and struck the child about 15 times on his face, head, torso and shoulders over a period of 15 minutes, punching him so hard at one point that the boy fell off the bed and struck his head on the tile floor. The child was rushed to Children's Hospital where he underwent surgery for bleeding on the brain. The boy -- identified by CNN affiliate WSVN as Willy Brown -- was on life support Wednesday and not expected to recover from his injuries, said Ed Griffith, spokesman for the Miami-Dade state attorney's office. Griffith said the boy ""may be brain dead,"" and the attorney's office expects to file first-degree murder charges against Dejesus as early as Wednesday night or Thursday. The complaint alleges that Dejesus waited to call for medical help for as long as an hour after the boy became unresponsive. He eventually called 911 after the boy's lips became blue, according to the complaint. Dejesus initially told police that the boy was beaten by a babysitter before admitting he did the beating, the complaint says. He is being held at a pretrial booking facility on $50,000 bond on the aggravated abuse charge and $7,500 on the child neglect charge, jail records show. In Session's Aletse Mellado contributed to this report.","Lee Willie Dejesus, 23, said he was teaching the child how to box .

"(CNN) -- Michaele Salahi, best known for crashing a White House state dinner with her husband last year, suffers from multiple sclerosis, according to a new book released Wednesday. Salahi's wafer-thin frame has often prompted rumors of anorexia, including from her castmate Lynda Erkiletian in the Bravo reality show, ""The Real Housewives of DC."" However, according to the book, the 44-year-old has suffered from multiple sclerosis for nearly 17 years. According to a news release, ""Cirque du Salahi: Be Careful Who You Trust"" will also dissect how the media got the story of the White House gate-crashing ""wrong from the get-go."" The Virginia couple slipped through White House security and shook hands with President Barack Obama in November despite not being on the guest list for a state dinner for the prime minister of India. They also had their pictures taken with Vice President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The book claims to lay out details on when and why the Salahis were invited to the dinner. Author Diane Dimond apparently also outlines the reasons why the couple did not publicly offer an explanation. ""On attorney's advice, and because of their 'iron-clad' contracts with Bravo, (the network on which she appears for ""The Real Housewives of DC""), the Salahis felt they could not defend themselves -- not even when called before a committee of the United States Congress. Only now, that the danger of a possible federal indictment has faded with time, do they feel they can tell their side of the story."" Under questioning from the House Homeland Security Committee in January, husband, Tareq Salahi, repeated over and over again, ""On the advice of counsel, I respectfully assert my right to remain silent and decline to answer your question."" The book says the couple has received death threats, subjected to late night TV ridicule and, in one instance, ""Michaele barely escaped flipping her car during a high speed chase with paparazzi."" ""We hope now that the book is out, America doesn't look upon us as criminals and crashers any longer,"" the couple said in a statement. ""We also want America to know that you can still have a full, exciting and productive life even if you or your loved one is battling a debilitating, chronic disease such as MS."" Multiple sclerosis is a potentially debilitating disease in which the body's immune system eats away at the protective sheath that covers the nerves. This leads to an interference in communication between the brain and the rest of the body. It affects 400,000 people in the United States, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.","Salahi has suffered from multiple sclerosis for nearly 17 years, book says .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq's main political parties Sunday reached a deal designed to allow non-U.S. foreign troops to stay in the country past the end of the year, when a United Nations resolution authorizing their presence expires. Iraqi and British soldiers during an Iraqi army training session in Basra last week. The deal would set a deadline of July 31, 2009, for all non-U.S. foreign troops to withdraw, according to Abdul Hadi al-Hassani, a lawmaker with the main Shiite parliamentary bloc, who spoke to Iraqi state television on Sunday. The agreement awaits approval by Iraq's Parliament, which is expected to vote on the measure on Monday, several Iraqi lawmakers said. The emergency negotiations came after lawmakers Saturday rejected a similar proposal that would have been law. Sunday's proposal, by contrast, was drafted as a resolution that would empower the Cabinet to authorize international troop presence without requiring Parliament to pass a law. Washington and Baghdad have already worked out a separate agreement that will keep U.S. troops in Iraq but tighten restrictions on them. Countries other than the United States that have troops in Iraq could be left with no legal cover for their presence there if Baghdad does not act swiftly. Iraq's Cabinet had approved a draft law authorizing non-U.S. foreign troops Tuesday, the first step in passing legislation, but it fell at the next hurdle -- Parliament. That left lawmakers scrambling Sunday for a way to give foreign troops legal cover quickly. Lawmakers expect Sunday's agreement to cut through the problem, because a resolution can be passed in a single day, while it takes at least a week to pass a law. British government lawyers, meanwhile, are studying ""all possible options"" to legally extend the presence of British troops in Iraq beyond New Year's Day in case Iraq's Parliament rejects the new compromise. Britain has the second-largest contingent of foreign troops in Iraq -- about 4,100 -- after the United States, which has about 142,500. All other countries combined have only several hundred troops in the country. Britain and Iraq announced last week that British troops would begin leaving Iraq in May 2009, while a ""handful"" of British military personnel would remain after that date to continue naval training for Iraqi sailors, primarily to protect oil platforms. The United States reached a security agreement with Iraq in November. That deal, which was ratified by the Iraqi Parliament, calls for American troops to leave Iraqi cities by June 2009, and to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. Beginning New Year's Day, U.S. commanders will have to get prior Iraqi government approval for any operations. American military personnel who commit crimes while not on duty or who commit grave crimes while on duty would be subject to Iraqi legal jurisdiction under the new agreement. The U.S. security agreement does not govern the presence of troops from other coalition countries. The Parliament's rejection of the Cabinet's proposed law allowing foreign forces to remain in Iraq after January 1 came after heated arguments that lasted for days. The session became so contentious that Parliament's speaker threatened to resign, lawmakers said. Some political blocs, notably the Sadrists, oppose any extension of the presence of foreign troops in Iraq. That group, headed by Shiite leader Muqtada al-Sadr -- an anti-Western cleric -- is demanding an immediate withdrawal of foreign forces.

"(CNN) -- A kidnapping suspect provided information that led to the discovery of the bodies of a missing Ohio woman, her 10-year-old son and a family friend, authorities said Thursday. The remains of Tina Herrmann, 32, her 10-year-old son, Kody Maynard, and her 41-year-old friend Stephanie Sprang were found in trash bags placed in the hollow of a tree, Knox County Sheriff David Barber said. Hearses left a wilderness area northwest of the town of Fredericktown in Knox County. Herrmann's daughter, Sarah Maynard, 13, was found alive Sunday morning in Mount Vernon, about 50 miles northeast of Columbus. Matthew Hoffman, 30, who lives in the home where Sarah Maynard was found, provided the information that led to the discovery of the three bodies, Barber said. Hoffman currently faces a kidnapping charge in the abduction of Sarah Maynard, Barber said. Hoffman has experience as a tree trimmer, the sheriff said. ""I have never experienced anything this big, this serious and this tragic,"" said Barber, who announced the news at a somber press conference. When asked if officials took the death penalty off the table in order to receive information on the location of the bodies, Knox County prosecutor John C. Thatcher replied that he could not say whether Hoffman had confessed to the killings. The county coroner will conduct autopsies and provide information to prosecutors, officials said. Thatcher said he is not sure yet what charges the evidence will support, but he expects to take the case to the grand jury within four to six weeks. A judge on Tuesday set a $1 million bond for Hoffman, who is accused of keeping Sarah bound and gagged in his basement, authorities said. The suspect has a November 23 preliminary hearing on the kidnapping charge, authorities said. A message left Thursday night with public defender Bruce Malek was not immediately returned. Barber said earlier this week that authorities were fortunate to find Sarah, but he said blood evidence found in Herrmann's home coupled with the amount of time the three have been missing had made the situation more serious. The girl was at the Herrmann residence, but Barber did not indicate whether she saw the slayings. The bodies were found about 20 miles from the Herrmann home. Sarah Maynard was found in an early morning raid involving a SWAT team and was released from the hospital Monday, after being evaluated and treated for injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening, the sheriff said. ""Sarah is with family and is doing well."" said Barber. ""She is a very brave little girl,"" he said. The disappearance of the three residents November 10 prompted a weeklong search throughout the rural region. But, in the end, the crucial information came down to Hoffman, Barber said. ""His information led to the location of the bodies,"" the sheriff said. ""We are a small community here. We became close to the victims' families,"" Barber said Thursday. ""We have to take care of the survivors."" Police said Tuesday they did not believe Hoffman was working with an accomplice. When asked whether the incident was a home invasion, Barber said it was not, but added that ""either they knew Hoffman or Hoffman made himself known to them."" Herrmann failed to report to work at a Dairy Queen in Mount Vernon, in central Ohio, on November 10, Barber told CNN affiliate WBNS. A deputy twice went to her home in Howard, about nine miles east of Mount Vernon, and saw her pickup there. No one answered the door, though lights were on in the home. A Dairy Queen manager went into the home on November 11 and found blood inside, Barber told the station. Asked about Hoffman's criminal record, Barber said he served prison time for an arson conviction in another state. Dawna Davis, who lives next to Hoffman, said she did not trust him. ""He was just different. He was odd. He just climbed trees and watched us,"" she said about Hoffman.","NEW: Prosecutor says he can't comment on whether suspect confessed .

"(CNN)  -- The midterm elections made it clear that Americans want a government that works for the people. The 112th Congress will be faced with a choice: Work with the president and the people to deliver results, or pursue an obstruction agenda that will leave individuals and businesses with an even less sustainable economy and future than they face today. If Congress chooses the collaboration path, members can tackle one issue that will enhance our national security, create jobs and help stabilize the climate --an issue with bipartisan roots that touches every corner of this nation: clean energy. Our nation's energy challenges are pressing and immediate. Unlike countries in Asia and Europe, the United States has neglected to join the global clean energy marketplace. We have no long-term clean energy plan, and so we have few domestic clean energy technologies or industries. While the world surges ahead, we risk being left behind, dependent on yesterday's energy solutions to solve today's energy challenges. We know what steps to take. We must reduce our dependence on oil. The transportation sector alone is 95 percent dependent on oil. American taxpayers spend from $500 million to $1 billion a day on foreign oil, 39 percent of which is imported from ""dangerous or unstable"" nations, according to a Truman National Security Project report. We must redouble our efforts to pass national clean energy and efficiency standards to meet our energy needs using homegrown, low-carbon sources. In turn, these actions will lower costs to consumers, create jobs, and spur an export market for innovative energy technologies. We must use public dollars and the government's credit enhancement power wisely, to leverage private capital for clean energy research, development, production, transmission, storage and deployment. We must confront climate change, which jeopardizes our economic prosperity by leaving us acutely vulnerable to increased water shortages, widespread drought and floods, and food insecurity. We can solve these problems. If the United States adopts a progressive energy strategy that combines market creation, financing for new industries and technologies, and infrastructure development, we can end our dependence on dirty fossil fuels, protect public health, and provide a solid foundation for economic growth and prosperity. Even without comprehensive climate and clean energy legislation, the next Congress can take concrete steps to strengthen the U.S. market for clean energy, providing critical stability and certainty for investors, business, and consumers. These polices have all previously been introduced in the House or Senate, with bipartisan and business support. None will contribute significantly to the federal deficit. Congress can: . -- Spur clean energy innovation, manufacturing, deployment, and export through an ambitious renewable electricity standard, extensions of the successful Treasury grant program (1603) and Section 48c manufacturing tax credit, and by establishing a Clean Energy Deployment Administration (CEDA, or ""Green Bank"") to leverage private sector investment for the deployment of clean energy. -- Encourage home and business owners to invest in energy efficiency and boost employment in the beleaguered construction sector by passing HOME STAR and Building Star. Those programs would reward consumers for installing energy-efficient equipment. -- Increase the $75 million liability cap for offshore oil damages, and pass other measures to enhance the accountability of oil exploration companies and give these companies an incentive to conduct their operations more safely. The United States can and must also act on the international stage to limit the consequences of climate change and enhance our national security. Congress can show a commitment to the U.S. goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, take concrete steps to reverse widespread deforestation that contributes 18 percent of these emissions globally, and provide short-term financing to allow the poorest countries in the world to adapt to the impacts of climate change. This is not a partisan agenda. The midterm elections reaffirmed that the clean energy agenda is a positive political agenda. In California, voters overwhelmingly supported the nation's only cap-and-trade policy even in the face of a well-financed attack led by a coalition of out-of-state fossil fuel industries. In defeating Proposition 23, California voters across the political spectrum forcefully chose new technologies and new jobs over a retreat to last century's polluted air and fossil fuel dependence -- showing broad bipartisan support for the most comprehensive emissions reduction measures the country has ever seen. Co-chairman of the ""No on 23"" campaign, former Secretary of State George Shultz said it best: ""Those who wish to repeal our state's clean energy laws through postponement to some fictitious future are running up the white flag of surrender to a polluted environment."" In Michigan, voters elected Gov. Rick Snyder, who campaigned as a ""good green Republican"" who believes that ""Michigan needs to be a leader in the innovative movement toward alternative and cleaner energy."" The clean energy economy is here for the long term. This Congress must decide if America will lead it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Gordon and Caldwell: New Congress can create jobs, end fossil fuel dependence .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy destroyer helped two Iranian civilian sailors found Thursday floating in a life raft in the Persian Gulf.

The USS Oscar Austin located the raft about 1,000 yards outside of Iranian territorial waters, the Navy said. ""After providing the two distressed mariners food and water, a rigid-hulled inflatable boat from Oscar Austin towed the life raft closer to the ship in the event the men required any urgent aid or further assistance,"" according to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. The Iranians said their boat sank the night before, and they were unaware of what became of their shipmates, the statement said.

"(CNN) -- Felipe Massa has revealed that he hopes to be at his home Brazilian Grand Prix -- but he won't be behind the wheel of his Ferrari. Felipe Massa has been given the all-clear to begin training as he bids to return to the race track. The 28-year-old had aimed to be able to return to racing before the end of this Formula One season, but is resigned to getting fit for 2010 following his horrific crash in July. Massa is now able to begin his rehabilitation after having plastic surgery on Monday to repair the broken bone in his cranium that resulted when a loose spring from Rubens Barrichello's Brawn hit him in the helmet during qualifying in Hungary. The operation, at the Sao Paulo's Albert Einstein hospital, took around four and a half hours, Ferrari revealed on its official Web site. Massa told UK newspaper The Guardian that his next step was to head to Europe to use a simulator and drive go-karts as part of his fitness evaluation. He had hoped to return to action at Interlagos -- where his 2008 world championship dream was crushed by Lewis Hamilton despite winning the race -- on October 18, but said that he would only be there as a spectator. ""That was the race I wanted to come back in, but it's difficult to say if it would've been possible. It will be difficult to watch it, but I will be there,"" Massa said. He told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that he still held a slim hope of driving in the final race of this season in Abu Dhabi on November 1. ""In 2010 I'll be back for sure and 100%, but it would be a dream to drive in Abu Dhabi,"" Massa said. Massa will be replaced by Giancarlo Fisichella for the final five races of 2009, with the veteran Italian having been released from his contract by Force India to take over from test driver Luca Badoer. He said he had never doubted that he would that he would get behind the wheel of a Formula One car again. ""It is my life,"" Massa, who is expecting his first child in November, told The Guardian. ""For me, the worst thing that happened was not being able to race. If you can't drive that's terrible. ""But my wife has already asked me, at least 10 times, 'Are you sure you don't feel any doubts or worries?' ""Always, I say, 'No, because this is what I like to do.' If I don't drive then I am not the same person. Ever since I was a small boy this is my life. This is what I like to do. ""So I really hope, and expect, nothing will change inside me when I go back into the car and start pushing myself to the maximum again.""","Formula One star Felipe Massa has had successful plastic surgery on his skull .

"(CNN)  -- Nine-man Inter Milan surged nine points clear of city rivals AC Milan at the top of Serie A with a dramatic 2-0 win in the San Siro on Sunday night. Diego Milito gave the reigning champions the lead in the 10th minute, but they were forced to much of the game with 10 men after Wesley Sneijder was sent of in the first half. Goran Pandev's 65th-minute goal sealed the win for Jose Mourinho's side, who then saw Brazilian star Lucio shown red in stoppage time before Ronaldinho saw his penalty saved at the end of a dramatic derby which could go a long way to deciding the outcome of the title race. Sneijder hit the outside of the post before Inter took the lead as Goran Pandev's ball sent Milito clear to beat Dida in the Milan goal. Dutchman Sneijder saw red on the half hour mark as his sarcastic gesture after Lucio had been pulled down saw him given his marching orders under strong protest. Milan tried hard to level at the start of the second half as Julio Cesar saved a close range Clarence Seedorf header from a David Beckham corner before Ronaldinho was just wide with a volley. Beckham, who earned a yellow card in the first half, sent in a series of dangerous crosses from the right, but it was Inter who sealed the win through Pandev's superb curling free kick. In injury time Lucio was sent off for a second booking as he conceded a penalty but Ronaldinho's effort was saved by Cesar to complete a miserable night for his team. Earlier on Sunday, Napoli won 2-0 at Livorno to move to within a point of third-placed AS Roma while Palermo beat Fiorentina 3-0 to go fifth.","Inter Milan beat AC Milan 2-0 in top of the table clash in San Siro .

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- When Wanda Barzee shared her story of an abusive marriage in a church-sponsored  counseling session in 1985, Brian David Mitchell took her hand to comfort her. ""And  we've held hands ever since,"" Mitchell's wife testified  Thursday. Barzee, 65, scanned the room, bit her lip, and  breathed heavily as she waited for her testimony to begin. When she raised her  right hand to take the witness oath, the heavy chain of her shackles appeared. Barzee struck a deal with state and federal prosecutors  last year and is serving a 15-year prison sentence for her involvement in the  2002 abduction of Elizabeth Smart. In spite of Barzee's agreement to testify, prosecutors in  Mitchell's federal trial did not call her to the stand, and she instead began  her testimony for the defense Thursday afternoon in a Salt Lake  City courtroom. In a flat voice and sometimes rambling, Barzee recounted  the start of her relationship with Mitchell; a journey that eventually led her  to the mountainside camp where she watched over a tethered teenage girl her husband  said was his chosen bride. ""I was married to my first husband for 20 years,  raising six children, and it was a very abusive situation. And I never healed  from that situation,"" Barzee said of her first marriage. ""Brian was so  supportive of me, he became my best friend,"" she said. ""He said he was abused, also."" ""We were both going through a divorce, so normally it  wasn't approved by the church that we date,"" Barzee continued, but she said they  received rare consent from leaders at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints to pursue the relationship. The two wed nine months later, on the day  Mitchell's divorce became final. The first year of marriage, she said, was ""hellish,""  with a volatile and possessive Mitchell often storming off from their apartment  in fits of anger. He told her he was ""consumed by fear and doubt,"" and sometimes  simply screamed into a pillow for long periods. She struggled through, because of a bishop's  blessing that said Satan would do everything in his power to separate the two,  but that the Lord would give Barzee the strength to fight back. Religious counsel and Bible readings gave her the  remedy: ""I started to be more silent, and I learned to be submissive and  obedient."" Also called to testify Thursday was Tim Mitchell, Brian  Mitchell's younger brother by six years, who described the defendant as an  intelligent and resourceful big brother who built model airplanes, devised  flying rockets, and endeavored to build a roller coaster in the family's back  yard. Once, Tim Mitchell recalled, Brian constructed a hot-air balloon from  cloth and sent it flying; it landed squarely on top of their home and set the  roof on fire. As Brian grew, he struggled with failed relationships, smoked marijuana and drank. That changed one night when the brothers discussed  their religious beliefs by a campfire, and the younger one professed his  devotion to the Mormon faith. ""He became a little bit tearful and said, 'I think what  you're saying is true' and 'I kind of lost my way.' I remember he had a pack of  cigarettes and he tossed them in fire and said he wanted to change his life,  too."" For a time, Brian did change, said Tim Mitchell, though  his relationships with family members were often strained and laced with  suspicion. Then, Barzee entered his life. ""All of a sudden we heard he doesn't have a job anymore, and he's moved up to Idaho, and he's living  in a trailer up there."" After a chance encounter in a Salt  Lake City grocery store sometime  later, Brian explained he and Barzee were wandering the country, ministering to  the homeless. Tim Mitchell expressed his concerns: ""I said, 'I think  you're going off on the wrong way, I think you're drifting away from the church.  I think maybe you've been deceived by a false  spirit.'"" Their contact was limited after that, until it ceased entirely about five years before the kidnapping of Smart. The brothers  encountered each other at their mother's house, and Brian asked to be called  ""Daveed."" His younger brother refused. ""I just kept calling him Brian."" ""I started feeling that this is really starting to look  like a mental illness and I sent a letter encouraging him to get some help,""  said Tim Mitchell, who works as a mental health counselor. Defense attorneys are mounting an insanity defense for  Brian Mitchell, 57, hoping to prove that mental illness clouded his mind to such a  degree that he did not understand that his actions were wrong when he abducted  and held Smart. Their case has so far consisted of family members and friends of  the defendant, and could include Mitchell himself. Barzee will continue her  direct examination Friday morning.","Wanda Barzee testifies for the defense in the trial of Brian David Mitchell .

"(CNN) -- A tour bus driver has been confirmed dead, while hopes dimmed for possible survivors of rock slides unleashed by Typhoon Megi last week in Taiwan. Tour bus driver Tsai Chih-ming, 19 Chinese tourists and a Chinese tour leader went missing Thursday along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan. Sections of the scenic highway, which is perched along a cliff on the island's eastern coast, gave way. Tsai's remains were positively matched with a DNA sample from his daughter, official Taiwanese media said Tuesday. Identification is pending for several other sets of remains that have been found. Confirmation of the driver's death brought Megi's death toll to 14 in Taiwan, its Central News Agency said. The typhoon injured nearly 100 others on the island last week. Family members of the missing Chinese tourists have asked Taiwanese officials to expand the search, hoping to at least find remains. Three dozen family members arrived on the island from southern China on Monday night. ""I was expecting to see my sister alive two days ago, but the chance of finding anybody alive is dim,"" Zhou Lifang said of missing tourist Zhou Suhua. ""But I'm still waiting for my sister, no matter herself or her body,"" she told China's state-run Xinhua news agency. ""The rescue team should expand its search areas."" The Taiwanese military has deployed helicopters, patrol boats and divers as part of search efforts. The navy was weighing whether to also dispatch a mine sweeper to further the search, the Central News Agency said. ""I'm moved by local rescue workers, because they are risking their lives to search for the missing,"" said missing tourist Wu Rika's sister-in-law, Zhao Hongbing. ""But from what I saw today, I think the local rescue authorities should mobilize more people and use more large machinery. I don't know when we can see our relatives with the current rescue force,"" she told Xinhua. Typhoon Megi struck the Philippines earlier last week, affecting an estimated 258,800 people and leaving thousands homeless. The typhoon made landfall in China's southeastern province of Fujian on Saturday, affecting nearly 650,000 people and destroying 500 houses, China's Xinhua news agency said. About 270,000 people had evacuated. Damage in Fujian from the strongest typhoon of the year was estimated at 1.59 billion yuan ($238 million).","Identification is pending for several other sets of remains .

The Northern Irishman was forced to see a back specialist following last weekend's Dubai Desert Classic, after suffering some discomfort during the tournament -- in which he finished sixth. However, McIlroy, who is playing on the US PGA Tour this season, has been told his problem is nothing more than a slight nerve impingement -- and some rest should see him fit to play in the Tucson event. McIlroy's spokesman, Martin Hardy, told Press Association Sport: ""He just needs to rest for a day.

"(CNN) -- The Ivory Coast have reportedly sacked coach Vahid Halilhodzic despite the Bosnian having guided the African team to this year's World Cup finals. Russia coach Guus Hiddink is among the favorites to take over for football's showpiece tournament starting in June, according to a report from the British Press Association which was carried on the Web site of world ruling body FIFA on Saturday. It said the 57-year-old Halihodzic, who took charge in 2008, had been axed after the Ivorians failed to live up to their favorite status at the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola last month and lost in the quarterfinals to Algeria. ""This Saturday I brought Vahid Halilhodzic's contract to an end because one of the aims that was set for him was not reached and that was to win the 2010 African Nations Cup,"" Cote d'Ivoire football federation president Jacques Anouma reportedly said on national television. Hiddink's contract with Russia expires on June 30, two weeks after the finals start, and he has a free period before taking over the reigns with Turkey in August. The Dutchman was also linked with the vacant Nigeria coaching role, which subsequently went to former Sweden manager Lars Lagerback, who signed a five-month contract on Friday. Hiddink recently revealed to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who played for him in a brief spell while coaching English club Chelsea, had sounded him out about taking the job. ""The interest from Ivory Coast is real, but first I have to analyze the situation,"" Hiddink said. ""I need to solve some matters before making my decision. ""Drogba asked me in the name of the players to accept the invitation. The Ivorian federation is also very interested.""","Ivory Coast have reportedly sacked coach Vahid Halilhodzic ahead of World Cup finals .

"(CNN) -- Russia coach Guus Hiddink has been named as Turkey's new national team manager after agreeing a two-year contract starting in August. The 63-year-old, who announced last week he was leaving his post with Russia after failing to win a place at the 2010 World Cup, will aim to guide Turkey through the upcoming qualifiers for Euro 2012. The Dutchman had a short tenure at English Premier League club Chelsea in 2009 when he led the side to the Champions League semifinals and lost only one match during his 22 games in charge. The Turkish Football Federation announced on Wednesday that Hiddink will take over in August, having decided not to renew his contract with Russia which expires on June 30. ""Turkish Football Federation president Mahmut Ozgener and TFF vice-president Lutfi Aribogan flew to Amsterdam to finalize the negotiations with Hiddink,"" it said on its Web site. ""The experienced coach agreed to a two-year contract with an option for a further two years."" The TFF said former Turkey captain Oguz Cetin and ex-goalkeeper Engin Ipekoglu would be among Hiddink's coaching staff, which will also include one of his fellow Dutchmen. Hiddink steered Russia to the semifinals of Euro 2008, but last November his team were beaten in a World Cup qualifying playoff by Slovenia. He has previously managed club sides Real Madrid and Valencia as well as taking South Korea and the Netherlands to fourth place at World Cups in 2002 and 1998, and Australia to the second round in 2006. One of his most successful periods was at Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, where he won six domestic league titles and four cups. The Turkish national team has been without a coach since Fatih Terim's departure in October, following a failed 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign. Turkey are in Group A for the Euro 2012 qualifiers with Germany, Austria, Belgium, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.","Russia coach Guus Hiddink has been named as Turkey's new national football boss .

"(CNN) -- Spanish club Sevilla have been rocked by the news that defender Sergio Sanchez has been ruled out for an indefinite period due to a heart problem. The 23-year-old has been advised to stop all physical activity and must have further medical tests. The news comes just two years after Sevilla midfielder Antonio Puerta collapsed during a game and later died due to cardiac arrest. Sanchez joined the club in July 2009 from Spanish rivals Espanyol, whose  captain Dani Jarque died at the age of 26 when his heart stopped after a pre-season training session in August. Another Spanish player, Ruben de la Red of Real Madrid, has been unable to play since collapsing during a Copa del Rey tie in October 2008 with what doctors suspect is a heart-related problem. Sanchez has returned to his home city of Barcelona to be with his family before being examined by doctors. ""Imagine [how we feel] considering what we have been through here,"" coach Manuel Jimenez told Sevilla's Web site. ""With the precedents that there are it's wise to be cautious, and you have to congratulate the doctors and cardiologists who examined him."" Captain Andres Palop was also worried about his teammate's condition. ""The dressing-room is concerned, we were not expecting news like that,"" he said. ""The important thing is his life, they've taken these measures for his own good. We hope that the specialists help him to remain active. The good thing is that it was detected in time.""

"Conakry, Guinea (CNN) -- After three days of violence throughout the country that killed at least nine people, injured dozens more and pushed the ruling military junta to declare a national state of emergency, calm returned to Guinea on Thursday. Military units are now deployed around the country to ""preserve the peace, tranquility and national unity,"" said Gen.Nouhou Thiam, army chief-of-staff, on state radio. The state of emergency will last until the West African country's Supreme Court finalizes results from a November 7 runoff between longtime opposition leader Alpha Conde and former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo that put Conde on top with 52.52 percent of the vote. Since the provisional results were announced on Monday night, supporters of Diallo, largely from the Peul ethnic group, have clashed with Conde supporters and security forces. Many shops in areas effected by violence reopened Thirsday, and automobile and pedestrian traffic resumed to near-normal levels. It was a remarkable turnaround from 24 hours earlier, when military police were clashing with civilians in broad daylight throughout the capital city of Conakry. French radio RFI reported that strife-torn cities in the northern Fouta Djallon region such as Labe, Dalaba and Pita had calmed by Thursday as well. But residents of Conakry's impoverished suburbs of Cosa, Hamdallaye, Enco5 and Bambeto -- areas of majority Peul supporters of defeated candidate Diallo -- are wary of the near future. Many residents reported gunfire throughout Tuesday night as roving military units continuously fired into the air. ""The daytime is calm, the violence happens at night. Last night I heard a lot of gunshots. I could not sleep, my wife and children were sleeping under the bed to avoid stray bullets,"" said Youssouf Bah, a Hamdallaye resident. ""The military was around, opening fire. When we woke up this morning, some families complained that the military was entering houses,"" Bah added. Guinea's military has long been scrutinized for alleged human rights abuses. Last September security forces opened fire on civilians protesting military rule, killing more than 150 and injuring more than 1,000, and allegedly raping hundreds of women, according to the U.S. government and human rights groups. Guinea, rich in minerals, is one of the poorest countries in Africa. It has never held free and fair presidential elections until this year.","Guinea's November 7 election was followed by growing conflict between political groups .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Protesters angry over the government's handling of a cholera outbreak clashed Monday with peacekeepers in two towns in northern Haiti, where the outbreak began last month. In Cap Haitien, schools and banks were closed, residents set fire to tires at entrances to the town and gunfire ricocheted through the streets, residents and officials told CNN. Vincenzo Pugliese, a spokesman for MINUSTAH, the United Nations' stabilization mission in Haiti, said anti-riot police were coping with the demonstrations, which he said began in the morning in at least two locations and had not caused any fatalities among peacekeepers or the population. ""Apparently, some people were injured by bottles or stones,"" he said. ""We are facing the consequences of a cholera epidemic and in two weeks the elections, so the population is scared,"" he said. ""It's a volatile situation."" He pointed to the fact that demonstrations began in separate areas as evidence that the outbreak was not spontaneous. ""Right now, security forces ... seem to have control already of the situation,"" he said. In addition, a police station was torched, the U.N. peacekeeping force said. An employee at the office of Tortug Air told CNN that the four daily flights typically scheduled between Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien had been canceled due to ""political tension."" She declined to be named. ""It's not safe to walk in the streets,"" Marc George, a resident of Cap Haitien, told CNN by telephone. ""All the schools and banks are closed. People are fighting the soldiers of MINUSTAH."" The demonstrations began after rumors spread that a Nepalese contingent of peacekeepers may have spread the disease, he said. ""So they attack them,"" he said. ""The people were shooting."" But Imogen Wall, a U.N. spokeswoman, denied that its peacekeepers were responsible for the outbreak. Cyrus Sibert, a journalist with Radio Souvenir FM, said he was aware of six injuries, one of them a child who was fatally shot. ""Many people from the slum area, they are burning tires, throwing rocks and bottles,"" he said. ""And they are very mad against MINUSTAH. And there are rumors that MINUSTAH is responsible for the cholera. And the cholera killed many people in Cap Haitien. Now taxi drivers are afraid to bring people to the hospital. It is very difficult to find a taxi driver when someone is sick."" He said trash trucks were picking up the dead. In the town of Hinche, northeast of the capital, about 400 demonstrators protested the peacekeepers, six of whom were injured, Pugliese said. Radio RCI reporter Jean Wesley said protesters threw rocks at MINUSTAH peacekeepers who, in turn, threw them back and also opened fire, wounding a protester. Haitian police were patrolling the town looking for the rock throwers among the protesters, some of whom had set tires afire, he said. The cholera outbreak, which was first confirmed last month in northwest Haiti, had spread across much of the country by Monday, killing close to 1,000 people and entering the makeshift camps teeming with people who were made homeless in January's massive earthquake, officials said. In all, 917 people were dead and 14,642 hospitalized as of Friday, the Ministry of Public Health said on its website. In the capital alone, 27 were dead and more than 600 hospitalized, officials said. ""It's a really worrying situation for us at the moment,"" said Stefano Zannini, head of mission for Medecins Sans Frontieres in Haiti, over the weekend. ""All of the hospitals in Port-au-Prince are overflowing with patients and we're seeing seven times the total amount of cases we had three days ago."" In the slum of Cite Soleil in the northern part of the capital, hundreds of people had sought treatment for the illness, he said. ""Patients are coming from everywhere, throughout the city, slums and wealthier areas."" If the numbers continue to increase at the current rate, he said, ""then we're going to have to adopt some drastic measures to be able to treat people. We're going to have to use public spaces and even streets. I can easily see this situation deteriorating to the point where patients are lying in the street, waiting for treatment. At the moment, we just don't have that many options."" Zannini noted that the situation in Port-au-Prince has been dire since the January 12 earthquake hammered what was already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, killing more than 200,000 people and shattering its already weak infrastructure. ""Since the earthquake, every available space that wasn't damaged has been filled by camps where people are living in extremely precarious conditions,"" he said. ""Just to find an empty area in this city is a major logistical challenge, so for us to find room to treat people is very complicated."" The group, known in English as Doctors Without Borders, has more than 100 international staff and more than 400 Haitian staff working in cholera treatment centers throughout the country, with more on the way, ""but it's just not enough,"" he said. ""We are close to being overwhelmed."" A scientist with the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said he had been in several hospitals ""that I would not characterize as overflowing ... but some places are busier than others."" Still, Haiti is particularly vulnerable to such an outbreak, said Dr. Robert Quick, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC's waterborne-disease prevention branch and one of 34 CDC personnel in the country. ""It's a country that has not seen epidemic cholera for decades,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""So it's an immunologically naive population, meaning that literally everyone is susceptible to infection. It's a resource-poor country where hygiene and sanitary conditions are not what they could be, so this is a combination that can result in what we're seeing now -- an outbreak with many cases."" The CDC workers were providing technical assistance, data and training to Haitian health care workers, he said. There is some reason for optimism, said Dr. Alex Lassedue of Project Medishare, in Port-au-Prince. ""Cholera is easy to treat; it's easy to prevent,"" he said. ""There is a great possibility to contain the number of cases."" The government was undertaking one such effort -- a public awareness campaign that uses cartoons to underscore in a graphic way that residents should wash their hands after using the bathroom to prevent cholera's spread. Such education could prove key, because this is the first such outbreak in living memory in Haiti, so public knowledge about the disease and how to avoid it is scant. ""This means there are a lot of misconceptions and rumors flying around, which has caused panic in the population,"" Zannini said. ""Some people are staying away from the cholera treatment centers or are afraid to have them in their neighborhoods because they think they help spread the disease. We've been trying to explain that the opposite is true: The closer a center is to a population, the better."" Though the disease can kill, it can also be treated successfully -- usually within two days, he noted. Anyone entering or leaving a cholera treatment center is sprayed with chlorine to prevent the further spread of the bacteria. But completion of treatment does not necessarily mean the end of concern. Many of those treated wind up going back to the camps, which shelter 1.4 million people in and near Port-au-Prince. There, hygiene, sanitation and clean water are hard to come by -- conditions that are conducive to further spread of the illness. If Haiti's cholera epidemic follows a pattern similar to that of the last cholera epidemic in the Americas, it could produce hundreds of thousands of additional cases over the next several years, Dr. Jon K. Andrus, deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization, told reporters last week. ""We have to prepare for a large upsurge in cases,"" Andrus said. ""We have to be prepared with all the resources that are needed for a rapid response."" The hemisphere's last cholera epidemic began in Peru in 1991 and spread to some 16 other countries, from Argentina to Canada, he said. From 1991 to 1997, Peru alone saw more than 650,000 cases. A similar pattern in Haiti could produce some 270,000 cases, which means public health officials likely face long-term challenges in Haiti. ""The bacteria have a foothold in the rivers and the water system, so it will be there for a number of years,"" he said. Still, he said, the cholera epidemic need not interfere with the Haitian general elections scheduled for November 28. ""There is no reason to expect the elections to have a negative impact on the cholera epidemic,"" said Andrus. ""And in fact, the Ministry of Health is planning to use the occasion to disseminate prevention messages to the population. It will help prevent the spread of infection."" The United Nations, which has appealed to international donors for $164 million in aid, said it anticipates as many as 200,000 people to be sickened with cholera over the next six to 12 months. A PAHO spokeswoman acknowledged that such estimates are ""guesses."" Symptoms of cholera, an acute, bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even nonexistent. But sometimes they can be severe: leg cramps, profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration, shock and death. Such an outbreak would be unlikely to occur in a developed country like the United States because it has water-treatment facilities and sewage systems, according to the CDC's Quick. ""We may get imported cases, but they're not going to take hold and turn into an outbreak. It's just not as likely,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho has claimed he did not assault a journalist after his side's 1-1 draw with Atalanta. Mourinho had been accused of ""physical and verbal aggression"" towards Corriere dello Sport's Andrea Ramazzotti and had been criticized by the Italian Sport Union of Journalists (USSI). The Portuguese coach denied hitting Ramazzotti, but did admit to a verbal spat with the reporter after the Serie A clash on Sunday. ""I don't like journalists near the team bus after a game,"" Mourinho said. ""I came out of the bus and I insulted him twice. But I did not try to hit him, there was no physical contact."" Mourinho did not attend the post-match press conference as he was serving a one-game touchline ban. Inter president Massimo Moratti confirmed earlier this week he would investigate the incident. A previous statement from the USSI following the incident urged Inter president Massimo Moratti, and the country's governing sporting bodies to investigate. It read: ""The physical and verbal aggression of Inter coach Jose Mourinho towards our colleague Andrea Ramazzotti marks one of the lowest and alarming moments in the relations between football and sporting press. ""Mourinho was already cited, prior to the Champions League game with Rubin Kazan, for his uneducated and disrespectful tone that he used towards certain colleagues. ""This aggression marks an irresponsible and unacceptable escalation. USSI expresses not only its indignation, but a strong concern for gestures and the unspeakable behavior that only increases tensions and controversies. ""It asks president Moratti to intervene energetically so that a member of his club (Mourinho) adapts to the great tradition of civility of the club and of the Moratti family. ""It asks as well of the FIGC (Italian Football Federation) that the sporting justice panel intervenes to examine the behavior of Mourinho for eventual sanctions.""","Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho has claimed he did not assault a journalist after his side's 1-1 draw with Atalanta.

"(CNN) -- More than 100 students at St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens, New York, have fallen ill recently. Some have tested positive for swine flu, health authorities say. New York high schooler Arianna Anastos and dad Chris talk with CNN's Anderson Cooper about the outbreak. At least 50 people in the United States have contracted the virus, officials say. Some of those who tested positive at the New York high school recently went to Cancun, Mexico, for spring break. By Tuesday, the number of deaths believed attributable to swine flu climbed to as many as 152 -- all of them in Mexico. (Twenty-six cases, including seven deaths, have been confirmed in the country.) St. Francis student Arianna Anastos, 16, wasn't on that spring break trip to Mexico, but her friends were. She started exhibiting flulike symptoms and was hospitalized last weekend. CNN's Anderson Cooper spoke Monday night with the teen and her father, Chris, on ""AC 360°."" Anderson Cooper: Arianna, how are you feeling right now? Arianna Anastos: I'm feeling a lot better now. Cooper: When did you first start to feel sick -- and what did you feel like? Arianna: I felt sick on Thursday. I was really dizzy. And I started having a fever and a cough. And I -- I had trouble breathing. Cooper: How bad did the fever get? Arianna: About 103 by Saturday. Cooper: So then what did you do about it? Arianna: I went to the hospital with my mom. And we waited for about an hour. And I got tested by the strep throat test and the nose swab. Cooper: You -- you haven't been to Mexico. How do you think you got it? Arianna: Probably from someone else. I mean, like, you know, people touch the railing on the school, like, and then I touch them, so any possible way. Cooper: Chris, you must have been incredibly concerned. How ... did you deal with this? Chris Anastos: Well, it was terrible. On Saturday morning, she looked like she was run over by a truck really. It really scared us. But ... Cooper: What do you mean by that? ... How did she look? Anastos: Well, she was on the couch lying down with her eyes closed, could not move, could not even open her eyes. I had a wet towel over her eyes to keep her temperature down. ... Cooper: Arianna, you went to the hospital on Saturday. ... Did they give you Tamiflu? Arianna: Yes. Cooper: So how soon after taking the Tamiflu did you start to feel better? Arianna: After two pills, I started feeling better. Cooper: How do you deal with the fear about spreading it? I mean, Arianna, were you worried that you might give it to other family members? Arianna: Yes. I mean, my parents would, like, come into the room, but they would wear masks and gloves. And they wouldn't allow anyone into the room. And they wouldn't allow me, like, to touch anything in the house, or else my mom would, like, spray it with Lysol. So, you know, no one got sick. .... Anastos: We took every precaution we could to prevent the spreading. And, obviously, we were -- my wife and I and my other daughter did not get it. So it worked for us. Cooper: So -- so, they gave you masks at the hospital, and you made sure to wear those around the house? Anastos: Yes. Yes. They -- they really did a good job. They explained to us what we needed to do. They gave us the equipment. And we just followed directions, and nothing happened to us. And Arianna is almost 100 percent. Cooper: Well .... I'm glad, Arianna, that you're feeling better. It's amazing what a difference two pills can make. And I'm glad you were able to get the Tamiflu. Arianna: Yes. Cooper: And I'm glad you're feeling better, and I'm glad no one else in your family caught this.","More than 100 students at New York high school fell ill with flulike symptoms .

"New York (CNN) -- An accused international arms dealer, now in U.S. custody for allegedly agreeing to sell millions of dollars of weapons to a Colombian narco-terrorist organization, pleaded not guilty Wednesday in a U.S. courtroom to four counts of terror-related crimes. Viktor Bout, the alleged dealer, could face life in prison if found guilty, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney said. The charges he faces are conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals; conspiracy to kill U.S. officers or employees; conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile; and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. In this case, that would be the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC. Bout appeared before U.S. District Judge Shira Sheindin wearing a brown tee shirt, black track pants and black sneakers. He was given headphones for translation to Russian, but Bout, who speaks six languages, spoke English to the judge and his attorney. He stood and said ""good day"" when the judge entered, and nodded that he understood his rights. The hearing lasted about 10 minutes. ""The so-called 'Merchant of Death' is now a federal inmate,"" said  U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Bharara said if Bout is convicted on all counts, he'll face a mandatory minimum of 25 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison. Bharara also announced an unsealed guilty plea of an alleged Bout associate, Andrew Smulian, on the charges. The Justice Department said that between November 2007 and March 2008, Bout agreed to sell millions of dollars of weapons to the FARC, called the ""world's largest supplier of cocaine"" and dedicated to the violent overthrow of the democratically-elected Colombian government. The weaponry allegedly included ""surface-to-air missile systems; armor piercing rocket launchers; AK-47 firearms; millions of rounds of ammunition; Russian spare parts for rifles; anti-personnel land mines; C-4 plastic explosives; night-vision equipment; 'ultralight' aircraft that could be outfitted with grenade launchers and missiles; and unmanned aerial vehicles."" Drug Enforcement Administration agents led a sting operation by posing as FARC members, and Bout was arrested in Thailand in 2008, where he remained in custody until Tuesday. Bout had agreed to sell the weapons to two confidential sources working with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the government said. In a meeting recorded in Thailand in March 2008, Bout said he could have the materiel airdropped to the FARC and offered to sell two cargo planes as well, the government alleges. Bharara said Bout indicated that he wanted the weapons to be used against U.S. personnel in Colombia. He indicated that the United States was his enemy and that the FARC's battles against the United States were his as well, the government said. He was arrested after that meeting by Thai officials. Bout arrived in New York late Tuesday, after being extradited from Thailand.  The Russian citizen and former Soviet military officer is being held in a high-security prison in Manhattan until his trial,  the Justice Department said. Bout allegedly began building his arms business as the Soviet Union disintegrated in the early 1990s. He acquired surplus Soviet planes and started shipping arms and ammunition to conflict zones, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Bout -- who has gone by many other names, including ""Victor Anatoliyevich Bout,"" ""Victor But,"" ""Viktor Budd,"" ""Viktor Butt,"" ""Viktor Bulakin"" and ""Vadim Markovich Aminov"" -- is accused of supplying weapons to war zones around the world, from Sierra Leone to Afghanistan.  But he has repeatedly said he has broken no laws and that the allegations against him are lies. Attorney General Eric Holder said Bout's ""alleged arms trafficking activity and support of armed conflicts in Africa has been a cause of concern around the world."" ""His extradition is a victory for the rule of law worldwide. Long considered one of the world's most prolific arms traffickers, Mr. Bout will now appear in federal court in Manhattan to answer to charges of conspiring to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to a terrorist organization for use in trying to kill Americans."" The Russian government issued a terse reaction Tuesday on Bout being sent to the United States. ""It is very deplorable that the Thai government succumbed to the outside pressure and conducted the illegal extradition of Viktor Bout,"" Russia's Foreign Ministry said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said: ""We as a country will continue assisting Viktor Bout as a Russian citizen in every possible way."" CNN's Sally Garner and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: Viktor Bout pleaded not guilty in court Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Defending champions Inter Milan face the prospect of losing the Italian league lead to their bitter city rivals after being held 1-1 by Palermo in Sicily on Saturday evening. Jose Mourinho's team could not reproduce the form that saw them so convincingly knock his former team Chelsea out of the Champions League on Tuesday. Inter moved two points clear of second-placed AC Milan, who can go top of Serie A for the first time this season with victory against Napoli on Sunday. The Nerazzuri took the lead after only 11 minutes against Palermo, with Argentina forward Diego Milito scoring a penalty after Lucio was fouled by Cesare Bovo. But Edison Cavani leveled just 13 minutes later after good work by Fabrizio Miccoli, earning a point that put Palermo two points ahead of Juventus in fourth place and extended their unbeaten home run to 23 matches. Inter, who had a 10-point advantage over Milan earlier in the season, have now won just once in their last seven league matches. Roma consolidated third in the table with a 4-2 win at home to Udinese, moving to within four points of Inter, who they face next weekend. Montenegro striker Mirko Vucinic scored a hat-trick, with two goals in the final 25 minutes killing off the visitors after Antonio Di Natale had drawn them level with a second-half double. Fiorentina moved to within a point of seventh-placed Genoa after crushing the Rossoblu 3-0 at home with goals from Mario Santana, Alberto Gilardino with a penalty and teenage substitute Khouma Babacar.","Inter Milan face prospect of losing Italian league lead to their bitter city rivals .

"(CNN) -- The head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has rejected suggestions that the United States has adopted too soft a stance on climate change negotiations with China. Protesters march through Sydney, Australia on June 13 to urge more government action on climate change. IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri has told CNN that the U.S. is right to absolve China from setting firm caps for national cuts in carbon emissions. His comments came after U.S. climate change negotiator Todd Stern was quoted in China Daily as saying, ""We don't expect China to take a national cap at this stage."" ""I feel that's a very pragmatic view,"" Pachauri told CNN. ""I don't think you'd expect any of the emerging markets to take an actual cut or even a commitment to reduce the rate of growth."" Stern was in China last week for high-level talks with his counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). In a press briefing on Friday, Stern described the talks as ""very constructive,"" and emphasized that the while the U.S. wouldn't demand specific cuts in China's carbon emissions, it expected a ""considerable"" reduction ""to where they would otherwise be."" Pachauri told CNN that developed countries would be best advised to lead by example and promise specific cuts of their own. ""It doesn't make sense to be tough because, let's face it, the developed world really has not lived up to what was expected of them. I think there's a far more productive strategy, a constructive approach would be to first make a commitment to reduce emissions in the developed world, get the emerging markets to take some fairly ambitious action within their own territories, and then we move from there onwards."" ""If you just keep pushing the Chinese that they've got to make some kind of a commitment for cuts or reductions in emissions intensity, you're not going to get anywhere,"" he added. China has demanded that developing countries cut their emissions by at least 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020. It also wants rich countries to donate up to one percent of their annual gross domestic product to help poorer countries tackle climate change. ""I think that's an opening gambit in a set of negotiations which in all will ultimately be decided by compromise from all those that are involved. I don't think it defines what's going to happen ultimately,"" Pachauri said. ""China will be certainly be persuaded to accept something lower, I have no doubt about it,"" he added. Last week, Japan became the latest developed country to publicly commit to specific cuts in carbon emissions. Its vow to reduce emissions by 15 percent on 2005 levels by 2020 was lambasted as lacking ambition, and is a fraction of the cut scientists say is necessary to prevent dangerous climate change. ""I think that's not going to be the final word,"" Pachauri said of the Japanese commitment. ""Who knows where the developed world as a whole will end, whether it will be 20 percent or 25 percent or more, but all of this is at least in the realm of possibility given the positive direction that I see coming out of Bonn."" Two weeks of talks in Bonn ending last Friday brought together delegates from 182 countries to lay the groundwork for a global climate change deal to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires at the end of 2012. It's one of a series of meetings scheduled in the lead up to the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen on December 7, seen as the most important climate change talks since the Kyoto deal was adopted in 1997. Pachauri told CNN the progress made at the latest round of talks in Bonn bodes well for a global deal in December. ""I think the whole spirit of the discussion it seems to me as being far more productive than one would have anticipated, particularly given the fact that the U.S. is now engaged fully in this part of these discussions in an active way,"" he said.","IPCC chairman noted ""positive direction"" of climate change talks in Bonn .

"(CNN) -- Four buildings on The Ohio State University campus were evacuated Tuesday after the FBI's Columbus, Ohio, bureau notified the university it had received an anonymous message that explosives were placed in the buildings, authorities said. The buildings are the William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library, the McPherson Chemical Lab, Smith Laboratory and Scott Laboratory. Classes in the three academic buildings involved were canceled, and all four buildings were closed until at least 5 p.m. or until the investigation is complete, according to Vernon Baisden, the university's director of public safety. Officials did not say whether any explosives had been found in the buildings. The university was notified of the threat at 8:19 a.m. and activated its Buckeye Alert System at 8:41 a.m., according to a message posted on the Ohio State website. Nearby streets were closed to vehicle traffic, university Police Chief Paul Denton told reporters. Local, state and federal authorities were assisting in the investigation, Baisden said, but he said officials could release few details about specifics. Aerial footage showed authorities with dogs entering one of the buildings. Students and employees ""responded in an orderly fashion,"" Baisden said, ""and we have no reports of any real confusion, other than the fact that everybody was wondering what was going on.""

"Lisbon, Portugal (CNN) -- Calling it a significant step forward for the alliance and European security, President Obama announced Friday that NATO will develop a missile defense system to safeguard most of Europe and the United States. The agreement, according to the president, followed a year of talks to determine the best ways to coordinate efforts to protect members of the 61-year-old alliance. The system would be ""strong enough to cover all NATO European territory and populations, as well as the United States,"" Obama told reporters in Lisbon, Portugal. The missile defense plan ""offers a role for all of our allies in response to the threats of our times,"" the president said. ""It shows our determination to protect our citizens from the threat of ballistic missiles."" Obama addressed reporters during the first day of what he promised would be a ""landmark summit"" featuring leaders of NATO's 28 member countries, as well as Russia. By the time it wraps Saturday, the alliance aimed to produce a set of new initiatives intending to reinvigorate and redirect NATO 20 years after the end of the Cold War. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Friday that heads of state had agreed to a new mission statement, calling it the alliance's ""road map for the next 10 years."" Crafting this so-called strategic concept had been a top priority of the meeting, which Rasmussen last month deemed ""one of the most important summits in the history of our alliance."" ""This strategic concept reconfirms the commitment by NATO members to defend one another against attack, and that will never change,"" Rasmussen said in Lisbon. ""But it also modernizes the way NATO does defense in the 21st century."" The document, prepared from recommendations made by a panel led by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, sought to build upon NATO's work in Afghanistan to redefine the alliance as a ""global"" actor that would work with regional partners to combat threats outside Europe. Under the new plan, NATO will bolster its role in counterinsurgency efforts, as well as the stabilization and reconstruction of key countries, according to Rasmussen. The defense alliance will also develop ""a standing capability to train local security forces"" and create a civilian arm to deal with other nations and groups. Obama added Friday that NATO, under Rasmussen, was also looking at how to deal with threats like improvised explosives and cyber defenses, all serving a commitment that ""an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all."" Afghanistan will be front and center on Saturday's agenda, with NATO members working with others who have committed resources to the nation and its government to ""align our approach,"" according to Obama. He said that includes having Afghan forces transition, between 2011 and 2014, taking over the security and governance mission in the country and forging a ""long-term partnership"" beyond that. Russia's relationship with NATO and the United States is also a chief focus Saturday. Obama said that starting then, NATO will work with Russia ""to build our cooperation with them in this area ... recognizing that we share many of the same threats."" In an exclusive interview with CNN's Chris Lawrence, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said he hoped that Russia's deepening partnership with NATO would cause Moscow to take a ""more civilized approach"" in dealing with its neighbors. Russian troops have occupied Georgian territory since its invasion in 2008. Saakashvili, whose country's bid to join NATO has been stalled for several years, said that he hoped the alliance's involvement would prompt Russia to withdraw its troops from Georgia. ""Once Russia becomes less paranoid, more cooperative, more self-confident in a nicer way -- because I think lots of things have emerged from their almost paranoid sense of insecurity -- hopefully, the small neighbors of Russia hopefully will feel themselves more safe,"" said Saakashvili, who met with Obama on Friday. Obama reiterated his belief that the U.S. Congress should pass the New START nuclear control treaty, which the U.S. and Russia agreed on last spring but has not been ratified by either nation's legislatures. U.S. Senate Republicans have held up a vote on START, citing a heavy workload, in the lame duck session before a new Congress comes in next year, and concerns about the strength of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Obama said Friday that NATO leaders had called passage of the treaty -- which, among other things, would restart mutual nuclear inspections and limit the arsenal in the two countries -- critical to European and global security. ""A failure to ratify [this treaty] ... will put at risk the substantial progress that has been made in advancing our nuclear security and our partnership with Russia,"" Obama said. The search for a new mandate for the entire alliance comes at a time that 16 of the 28 NATO members have announced cuts in defense spending. NATO officials said leaders are expected to agree at the summit on a list of the top 10 spending priorities, including helicopters, transfer aircraft, technology to combat improvised explosive devices and increased medical capabilities. The outcome of the war in Afghanistan is intrinsically tied to the future of the NATO alliance, a new analysis from the RAND Corporation suggested. The report, published Friday, warns that the U.S. lead in the war could undermine any future willingness to fight together if needed. ""In an alliance that finds achieving consensus is central, having one partner clearly overshadow all others highlights the real limits of the transatlantic alliance,"" the report said. The difficulty and length of engagement will weigh on decisions by alliance members to intervene or aid in the future. ""The scope of NATO's future roles abroad may be more limited, such as focusing on humanitarian assistance or training, advising, and assisting nations that seek support. While these efforts may entail long-term commitments, they would fall well short of committing combat forces,"" wrote the RAND authors, Andrew Hoehn and Sarah Harting. The new strategic concept will cite current security challenges facing NATO members in the 21st century, such as terrorism, cyber warfare and piracy. Rasmussen has encouraged NATO members to be more agile in order to respond to 21st century threats and to continue to invest in military technology despite the global economic downturn. He urged allies to ""cut fat, not muscle"" and pool military spending. The United States is pushing for a realignment of military spending priorities. ""We have proposed and hope to have accepted a set of capabilities that the alliance, in a time of dwindling resources, will decide it must fund,"" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told reporters earlier this week. ""Those are capabilities that deal with ongoing operations in Afghanistan, but also capabilities to deal with 21st century threats, including beefing up our cyberdefenses and embracing the deployment of missile defenses to protect European territory and populations against the growing threat of ballistic missiles."" Obama also will hold a summit with European Union leaders, seeking to reaffirm a partnership with Europe that many feel has gone adrift as the United States expands its partnerships in Asia. Jobs and economic growth are expected to top the agenda at a time of growing tension between U.S. and European countries over the way to fix the global economy. While the United States has pushed for stimulating economic expansion with more government spending, many European allies are tightening their belts. The future of some 80,000 U.S. military forces in Europe will also be discussed. European leaders are looking for Obama to keep U.S. troops at their current levels, although the Obama administration has urged Europe to share more of the burden of its own defense.

"(CNN) -- The chief of the national police in Ecuador, Freddy Martinez, said Friday that he was resigning effectively immediately. His departure comes a day after a chaotic uprising by police officers left President Rafael Correa trapped for several hours in a hospital. Troops loyal to the president arrived at the hospital and rescued him Thursday evening; two police officers were killed. The police officers said they were angered by a new law that would take away their bonuses and reduce their compensation. The president, who was roughed up and hit by tear gas, said the law would do no such thing and said the police officers had not even read it. Hours after the rescue, Correa repeated his claim that compensation issues were merely a pretext for police to kidnap him and try to overthrow his government. ""It was an attempt and a perfectly coordinated conspiracy,"" he said late Thursday. On Friday, a group of South American leaders condemned the disturbance as an ""attempted coup"" and praised troops for rescuing the country's president in a shootout with police. In a statement issued after an emergency meeting in Argentina, the group of presidents and top officials pledged to send their foreign ministers to Ecuador later Friday to show support for Correa. Two people died in clashes between police and the military after hundreds of troops arrived at a hospital outside the country's capital to rescue Correa on Thursday night, Ecuador's Red Cross reported. At least 88 people were injured in unrest throughout the country. The violent standoff between police and troops lasted for nearly an hour, said Freddy Paredes, a reporter for CNN affiliate Teleamazonas who watched the shootout from a hospital room. Correa, wearing a military helmet and a gas mask, escaped in a wheelchair as gunfire rang out, he said. ""The police are very fearful, because the president has announced that there will be no forgiveness nor forgetting for the police that were insubordinate,"" Paredes said . Correa said late Thursday that those responsible would be held accountable. ""It has been a very sad day. I send a warm embrace to those who were injured. I pray to God that nobody dies. Because of what happened, we now need to purge our National Police,"" he said. The disturbances occurred as Correa threatened to dissolve the National Assembly over a dispute about several laws, including public service and education. Violence erupted early Thursday when police officers took to the streets, claiming a new law would take away their bonuses and reduce their compensation. Government officials tried to quell the rebellion, insisting that the security forces had been misinformed and warning that the nation's democracy was in danger. When the president tried to negotiate with them, the protest turned violent. A tear gas grenade was thrown, and Correa was led away, holding a gas mask to his face. Correa, who is recovering from knee surgery, said angry police tried to suffocate him. ""They made me bend my knee to the point that I could not walk,"" he said Thursday night. He stressed that a law passed Wednesday by the National Assembly did not cut compensation bonuses of police, as some had asserted, and he accused his political opponents of misinforming and manipulating the public about the legislation. Thursday night, he said that police -- ""not one of them"" -- had read the law. ""When they demanded that I revoke the law to let me out, I told them, 'Don't waste time with me. I leave as president of a dignified nation, or I leave as a cadaver,'"" he said, his voice hoarse from shouting into a microphone . ""Of course, the law will not be revoked,"" he added, stabbing his finger into the air. Speaking to a jubilant crowd outside the presidential palace, Correa said former president Lucio Gutierrez and other political opponents were behind the day's unrest -- which he repeatedly called an attempted coup. But in an interview earlier Thursday with CNN en Espanol, Gutierrez sharply denied that claim. Angry police said Thursday that they were overworked and underpaid. ""We work 14 hours a day,"" a uniformed officer said on Ecuador TV. ""We are the ones who never protest."" Both of the men killed in Thursday night's clashes were police officers, the Red Cross said. Correa thanked his supporters -- in particular his bodyguards -- for standing behind him and said the rebel police effort to oust him had failed. ""Nobody has supported the police as much as this government, nobody has increased their salaries as much,"" he said. ""After all we've done for the police, they did this!"" Correa said the actions of the police left him ""profoundly sad, like there was a knife in my back."" The government declared a one-week state of emergency Thursday afternoon and put the military in charge of security. The military said it will support the president and the nation's democratic institutions. When the Union of South American Nations convened an emergency meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to discuss the situation, the presidents of many South American nations -- including Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Colombia's Juan Manuel Santos -- were in attendance. After the meeting, Chavez accused the United States of being behind the unrest in Ecuador. ""The Yankee extreme right is trying right now, through arms and violence, to retake control of the continent,"" Chavez said. Earlier Thursday U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement expressing support for Correa. ""The United States deplores violence and lawlessness, and we express our full support for President Rafael Correa, and the institutions of democratic government in that country,"" she said. Correa was elected president in 2006 and took office in 2007. The socialist president earned a doctorate in economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2001. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Rafael Romo in Atlanta, Georgia, and journalist Martha Sandoval in Quito, Ecuador, contributed to this report.","NEW: Police chief resigns in Ecuador .

"Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- Ireland and the European Union are engaged in a strange and increasingly public tug of war. Dublin has been adamant that it doesn't need money from abroad to stay afloat despite a crisis in its banking sector. However, the republic's central bank governor admitted Thursday that the country was likely to accept a loan from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Speaking on the phone from Frankfurt, Ireland's Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan told Irish broadcaster RTE that a loan worth ""tens of billions of euros"" is ""definitely likely to happen."" ""Market conditions have not allowed us to go ahead without seeking the support of our international collaborators so that is what's ahead,"" he said, ahead of high-level talks between the Irish government and the IMF and ECB talks in Dublin Thursday. They are there to investigate what aid, if any, is needed and whether all that is required is a loan guarantee. So it's a loan, not a bailout? The central bank governor was very specific in his terminology. ""When you are talking about the IMF, the IMF talks about loans -- not bailouts. Loans get repaid so there hasn't been a bailout from the IMF. Shareholders in the IMF -- which are governments -- get their return on the money that they have advanced to the IMF,"" Honohan said. Before Honohan's statement, all talk was about the pressure the European Union was putting on Ireland to accept a rescue package as the euro took a battering on contagion fears. The worry was -- and still is -- that Ireland's problems could exert further pressure on other ailing countries, namely Portugal and Spain, which are already struggling to pay their debuts. Relief in Ireland would bring yields on Portuguese and Spanish government bonds back to normal levels would mean they pay less on interest and more, hopefully, toward reducing their own deficits. IHS Global Insight estimates banking-related costs will eventually mount to some 30 percent of Irish GDP. ""On a banking crisis 'Richter scale' this is a 'very severe crisis' of about seven to eight out of 12,"" director of sovereign risk Jan Randolph said in a briefing note. For comparison, that is less severe than the Iceland banking crisis (10 to 12), but more serious than the banking tremors in the UK and the U.S. (four to five). So why was Ireland resisting aid? As recently as Wednesday, Ireland's finance minister Brian Lenihan was insisting that the country's banks had ""no funding difficulties."" By Thursday, he was being quoted as saying that a substantial contingency fund from the EU and IMF would be a ""very desirable outcome."" The government has resisted the idea of a financial aid package because it would inevitably come with strings attached. The country's low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate was a point of contention. Ireland has said the tax is ""non-negotiable"" despite complaints from other EU members that the tax gives the country and an unfair advantage when it comes to attracting business. Ireland's 2011 budget is due out on December 7 and the government has been keen to stress that it will include sufficient spending cuts to get the country back in shape without outside help. How did Ireland get into this mess? Ireland recorded stunning economic growth during what is known as the ""Celtic Tiger"" era from around 1993 to 2007 when the global financial crisis hit. Irish banks, like others around the world, loaned money to people who in some cases couldn't pay it back. Cheap loans created extra demand for housing and as prices surged the construction industry raced to build more. ""The building frenzy was, in reality, driven by the ambitions and actions of developers and speculators, supported by banks hungry for quick profits, pro-growth local authorities afraid to be left behind, and a government greedy for the indirect, cyclic taxes the construction sector generated,"" according to a recent report from the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis (NIRSA). According to central bank figures released on November 17, the number of mortgage loans in arrears has jumped by 11 percent since the end of June. At the end of September, more than 40,000 mortgage loans had been in arrears for more than 90 days. Combined, the mortgage loans are worth €7.8 billion ($10.6B).

"(CNN) -- In-form England striker Wayne Rooney scored the opening two goals as Manchester United crushed AC Milan 4-0 to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League. Park Ji-sung and Darren Fletcher were also on target for the English Premier League champions as United secured a convincing 7-2 aggregate success. All the talk beforehand was of Milan midfielder David Beckham's return to Old Trafford for the first time since United sold him to Real Madrid in 2003. And the England star was given an emotional reception by the United fans when he came on as a second-half substitute. However, Milan were already 3-0 behind when Beckham was introduced by Milan coach Leonardo and, despite some nice touches and a couple of dangerous crosses, was powerless to help Milan back into the match. Rooney took his personal tally for the season to 30 with goals either side of half-time. The opener came in the 13th minute when Rooney rose between two Milan defenders to head home a Gary Neville right-wing cross. And the second came just 54 seconds after the break when Rooney broke clear through the middle to get a decisive touch to Nani's superb cross with the outside of his foot. The tie was firmly killed off when Korean Park finished off a Paul Scholes pass and the scoring was completed when Darren Fletcher converted at the far post with two minutes remaining. ""It was a disappointing night because we lost the game but returning here is always special,"" Beckham told ITV Sport. ""It was unbelievable. I have to say thank you. It was really incredible.

"(CNN)  -- Felipe Massa will not be returning to Formula One this season, his Ferrari team have officially announced. Massa is still showing the scars of the horror crash at the Hungarian GP in July. The Brazilian has been out of action since a freak crash in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix left him with life-threatening head injuries. The speed of his recovery from a fractured skull has prompted speculation he could take the wheel of the Ferrari for the season-ending race in Abu Dhabi on November 1. Indeed Massa was back on the track in a private test at Ferrari's Maranello headquarters in Italy on Monday, but the team insist that is merely a stepping stone for next season. ""This is in no way a proper test session and looking at the stopwatch will not be on the agenda - there will be plenty of time for that in 2010, when, alongside Fernando Alonso, he will begin development work of the new single-seater,"" read a statement on the team's oficial Web site www.ferrari.com. Ferrari did reveal that a medical check up that Massa underwent in Paris last Friday proved ""rather positive"" but emphasized it did not signal a dream return. ""Felipe and the team want to proceed gradually and without any hurry to recover as well as possible from the effects of the accident that happened in Budapest back on 25th July. ""Therefore talk of a proper return to Formula One can wait until the start of the 2010 season and only at that time will the medical checks be carried out, as required by the FIA in order to allow someone who has been injured to return to racing."" Giancarlo Fisichella will continue to deputize for Massa for the remaining two races of the season in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, driving alongside Kimi Raikkonen of Finland. Raikkonen is leaving the team at the end of the season to be replaced by two-time world champion Alonso, who will carry Ferrari's hopes for 2010 alongside 2008 title runner-up Massa. The 28-year-old Massa was hit in the head by a spring which fell from the Brawn GP car of fellow Brazilian Rubens Barrichello. There were fears for his life in the immediate aftermath of the horror crash as he lay in an induced for coma in a military hospital in Budapest. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher was slated to replace him in a sensational return to Formula One, but the German superstar had to cut short his comeback due to a neck injury. Test driver Luca Badoer proved a below-par replacement and Fisichella, who will stay at the Ferrari next season as the reserve driver, jumped ship from Force India for the drive.","Ferrari say Felipe Massa will not be returning to F1 circuit this season .

"(CNN) -- The federal Bureau of Land Management said Friday that it had only one ranger on duty and that it failed to follow its own procedures in permitting an off-road race in Southern California where eight spectators were killed in a crash. ""This tragic accident was a call for us to take an unvarnished look at what went wrong and what BLM can do to improve safety and oversight of these types of races,"" said acting Bureau of Land Management State Director Jim Abbott. Since the crash during an August 14 event in Johnson Valley, near San Bernardino, the agency has taken steps to ensure all approval procedures are carefully followed, it said in a statement. The California Highway Patrol is leading the investigation into the incident, which left eight people dead and nine injured when a truck taking part in the 200-mile event crashed into a crowd of spectators along the track. The driver did not face charges, the highway patrol said at the time. The Bureau of Land Management is investigating whether sanctioning body Mojave Desert Racing violated any safety regulations, spokeswoman Jan Bedrosian told CNN. Since the crash, the agency has approved 20 permits from organizers for events across the California desert, Bedrosian said. Four were denied, and five from Mojave Desert Racing were suspended, she said. Messages for Mojave Desert Racing were not immediately returned Friday. Daniel Hesser, public information officer for the California Highway Patrol Inland Division, said the investigation is continuing and there was no timetable for submitting findings. ""We're talking to everyone we can,"" he said. The August race was part of an amateur series on a course in the Lucerne Valley area of San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles. Mojave Desert Racing urges spectators to stay back 100 feet from the 50-mile course, but a Highway Patrol spokesman said there were ""no delineations"" for the course. Images from the night of the crash show trucks speeding within feet of spectators. The bureau found its procedures for race events are appropriate, but said that offices did not always carry them out. ""Adherence to these procedures was inconsistent throughout the five BLM field offices in the 11-million acre California Desert,"" it said in a statement. There was no pre-race review or detailed look at the August race's operating plan, Bedrosian said. And only one ranger was on duty. ""Obviously, the one was not adequate that night,"" Bedrosian said, adding that some events now are being staffed by three to five federal rangers. The department has only 38 rangers in the desert and is ""spread awfully thin,"" Bedrosian said. But it is committed to permitting and staffing events to ensure they are conducted in a safe manner, she added, . Bob Abbey, national director of the Bureau of Land Management, said that a directive to field offices stresses event safety. ""If our field offices cannot fulfill or complete all the required steps in authorizing this event, then no permit will be issued,"" he said. The report concludes with specific action items. These include providing adequate Bureau of Land Management ranger and recreation staffing at all events, requiring companies to compensate the bureau for processing and administering permits that take up more than 50 hours of staff time, and requiring more oversight from the bureau's district and state offices to check for policy compliance and program consistency. ""Everyone looks at this with a shared sense we all need to do better,"" Bedrosian said.","Bureau of Land Management didn't follow own procedures, internal report says .

"London, England (CNN) -- The largest collection of Smurf memorabilia, the longest dog tongue, and the most football management rejection letters could only be together in one place -- the annual list of Guinness World Records. All of them have made the 2011 edition, released Thursday. The Smurf collection involves 1,061 different items owned by Stephen Parkes, 44, of Nottingham, England. He said he began collecting them in 1976 when he was 10, and that today he will pay as much as 500 pounds ($780) for a rare item. ""It's great to get in the book, although I think I'm going to get a fair amount of stick (criticism) from friends when they see the photos,"" Parkes said. Patrick Rielly of Scotland saw the bright side after setting a record for the most rejection letters -- 46 -- from professional football clubs across Britain. ""I might have not got my dream job, but now I have a world record,"" he said. ""Every cloud has a silver lining!"" The 2011 book, published internationally Thursday, is the annual edition of a best-selling record book that has sold 115 million copies to date. This year's records include the longest-lasting lightning storm (on Saturn for eight months); the longest hair (18 feet, 5 inches); and the heaviest living woman to give birth (American Donna Simpson, at 531 pounds). Mario's Cafe Bar in Bolton, England, set a record that may whet a person's appetite -- or ruin it altogether. It has the largest commercially available English breakfast, a traditional filling and greasy meal. Mario's version includes six slices of bacon, six sausages, four eggs, six slices of bread, five black puddings, mushrooms, a can of beans, and tomatoes. It weighs 6 pounds, 7 ounces and costs 10.95 pounds ($17), but anyone who can eat it within 20 minutes gets it free. With a breakfast like that, diners may need a workout. For inspiration they can look to British man Stephen Buttler, who broke the record for the most push-ups with claps in one minute -- 73, or 1.2 push-ups per second. Animal records are always a feature, many of them even stranger than the world's smallest cow at 33 inches from hind to foot in West Yorkshire, England. A Pekingese dog from Texas named Puggy set the record for the longest dog tongue, measuring 4.5 inches, nearly the same length as his body. His owner said she adopted Puggy eight years ago after he was abandoned. ""From being a stray dog, being dumped, to being a Guinness World Record holder is just phenomenal,"" owner Becky Stanford said. ""I just can't believe it."" A feisty Jack Russell terrier from California is in the book for popping 100 balloons in the fastest time by a dog -- just 44.49 seconds. The dog, Anastasia, showed her talent for the first time at a New Year's party, her owner said. ""When Anastasia sees balloons in public, she starts with a small whine and builds to a squeal,"" said Doree Sitterly. ""She'll then begin screaming like a banshee and is difficult to control. She is focused on popping balloons only and nothing else."" Other animal records include the oldest gorilla in captivity, Colo, who lives in the United States and is now 53. The oldest sheep is an Australian named Lucky, who is 24, and the longest rabbit is Darius, who lives in Britain and is 4 feet, 3 inches. ""Animal achievements are among the most popular records in our book, so for 2011, in addition to the usual chapter on record-breaking creatures in the wild, we've added an entire new chapter focusing on our favorite pets, zoos, and farm animals, said Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief of Guinness World Records.","The 2011 edition is out Thursday .

Over the last couple of months, CNN has highlighted diverse perspectives on faith in the black community in an opinion series, ""The Black Pulpit."" Explore some of those viewpoints below: . Black churches and the role of empowerment The Rev. DeForest ""Buster"" Soaries Jr. is the senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens in Somerset, New Jersey. He is featured in CNN's documentary, ""Almighty Debt"" and explained what he thinks of as the black churches' role of empowerment. ""What is irrefutable is that without a deep and authentic faith and a passion for the institutional development of that faith, African-Americans could have never sustained the fortitude necessary to survive and succeed in the American experience."" Heavenly minded, financially empowered  Bishop T.D. Jakes, best-selling author and senior pastor of the legendary 30,000-member Dallas-based church, The Potter's House, writes ""As a faith leader, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, I've always had one foot in both the practical and the spiritual worlds.

Finding refuge in Buddhism  Myokei Caine-Barrett is the first woman of African-Japanese descent to be ordained as a minister in the Nichiren Shu Order.

""Buddhism has been the mainstay of my life, enabling me to understand life's reality and providing a practice of faith to deal with that reality."" Authentically black and truly Catholic  Dr. C. Vanessa White, an assistant professor of spirituality and the firector of a program that prepares African-American lay Catholic men and women for ministry in the church, says ""What has helped black Catholics survive in the midst of almost insurmountable odds is a spirituality that bridges both our African-American experience and our Catholic faith.""

"(CNN) -- The latest round of Champions League matches finds a string of top European managers on the verge of being dumped out of the competition - a failure that could cost them their job. Bayern Munich boss Louis Van Gaal and Rafael Benitez at Liverpool are staring an early exit in the face after a disastrous run of results, while Manuel Pellegrini at Real Madrid and even Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho are in danger of crashing out of the money-spinning tournament at the first hurdle. So how do coaches cope with the unique pressure that comes with a high-profile job in football, and are the skills needed to be successful in soccer applicable to other areas? Andy Barton, a mental performance consultant at The Sporting Mind clinic, says the first, and fundamental, characteristic all proficient gaffers need is self belief. ""All the top managers have different styles but the common denominator is the confidence they have in themselves,"" he said. ""You need a true understanding of the game but also people. You need an ability to motivate players to get them geed up just to the right level, you need to know that certain people need a certain kind of attention."" The skill-set top level coaches display can be adapted to almost any workplace, Barton claims. ""In business, you need to be able to man-manage and inspire people, set goals for them, help them overcome obstacles, give them self-belief and to give them a kick up the backside when they need it. There are a lot of parallels between high-level sports coaching and people who are successful in a business environment."" Barton says the beautiful game has recently woken up to the benefit that sports psychology can offer, and the key to success is to keep things simple. ""You have to concentrate on the moment, one game at a time or one half at a time. If a coach is thinking two games ahead or about the consequences of winning or losing he's not going to be effective. If coaches can't get themselves in the right frame of mind they're not going be able to do it to their players."" The mind games between coaches can be fascinating viewing for fans, but Barton says the verbal volleys are becoming an increasingly important part of the game. He points to Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez and his infamous rant about Alex Ferguson, the manager of rival side Manchester United. Benitez convened a press conference where he criticized Ferguson's supposed ""arrogance"" in wanting match-scheduling and refereeing to suit his team in England. ""When Benitez attacked Ferguson it bounced off as if nothing happened and had a really detrimental effect on Benitez. He appeared agitated, frustrated and stressed. Ferguson just swatted him away as if he was an annoying fly. That suggests Ferguson feels far more in control and that's going to ripple down to his players - they feel more confidence because their coach seems the more dominant of the two."" Barton also stresses the importance of touchline body language as a measure of control for managers, and the trust they must have in their players to carry out their demands to the letter. ""Players do respond to body language,"" he added. ""Jose Mourinho has very positive body language, even when he was sitting back with his arms round the back of the chairs. It's something that says to the players ""I'm in control."" ""But trust is very important too. If you don't trust your players you're probably not going to get that much out of them anyway, so you do have to get to that level where you can let them get on with it."" Andy Barton is a mental performance consultant at The Sporting Mind clinic.","Sports psychologist Andy Barton says self-belief is key for any manager .

"(CNN) -- The blog ""Stuff White People Like"" is wildly popular with fans who've embraced the hilarious, satirical sendup of the white middle class that -- according to the list -- have an ongoing love affair with things such as coffee (No. 1), organic food (No. 6), yoga (15) and the Toyota Prius (60). Blogger-turned-author Christian Lander is the force behind ""Stuff White People Like."" The site also has spurred an outpouring from those who view it as offensive and racist. Now devotees and detractors alike have more to discuss with the release of the book ""Stuff White People Like: A Definitive Guide to the Unique Taste of Millions"" by the blog's creator, Christian Lander. Filled with photos and some content from the blog, the guide includes new entries exclusive to the book. Lander also worked with a designer to create things such as flow charts on ""How to Name a White Child"" and ""White Career Trajectories"" as well as a test of the reader's ""whiteness."" As befitting the genius behind such a site and book, Lander is a bit of a ham (actually, make that Canadian bacon since he hails from Toronto, Ontario).  Watch Lander talk about what he likes » . The origins of ""Stuff"" date from January 2008, he said, because of an instant messenger conversation between him and his friend Miles about the HBO drama ""The Wire."" Miles, who is Filipino, tossed off that he didn't trust any white person who didn't watch the series. That exchange started a back-and-forth between the two about what white people were doing instead of watching the show. ""We said, 'Oh, they are going to plays, they're doing yoga, they're getting divorced,' "" recalled Lander, who couldn't pass up the gold mine of ideas and started blogging. ""The goal was to literally make Miles and a few of my friends laugh, and it just took off."" Within six weeks, Random House came calling, and a book deal was finalized. CNN talked to the blogger-turned-author about his ""whiteness,"" whether he is like Stephen Colbert but instead mocks earnest, left-wing types, and why ""Stuff White People Like"" will never make the list of ""Stuff White People Like."" CNN: Where do you get your ideas? Christian Lander: Farmers' markets. CNN: How do you get your ideas at farmers' markets? Lander: Keeping my eyes open. I just see what people are up to. And the mirror is another good place to look for inspiration. I really make fun of myself. CNN: So what makes you an authority on white people? Lander: Look at me [laughing]. I mean, I have liberal arts degrees; I look like this. I'm on the inside. CNN: Do you ever worry about offending people? Lander: No. I'm glad when I offend people with this because it's not offensive. What's been great about it is the title draws people in, and right away they are like, ""What is this? Am I going to get offended by this?"" Then they read it, and it's not what they expect. People see the title and they expect ""Stuff White People Like"" to be entries like mayonnaise, or dancing poorly, these old stereotypes that are really outdated and aren't even funny anymore. You're sort of expecting it to be the lame white guy stuff and you go, ""Oh my God, this is all the stuff I actually like."" It's playing off white stereotypes, but it's not stereotypes in a demeaning way. CNN: If those are old stereotypes, could your stuff be considered ""new stereotypes""? Lander: No, because they're true [laughing]. I consider these valid observations. It's an update on this idea of a yuppie. In the '80s, the idea of the yuppie was really about just consumerism: I have an expensive BMW, I have these things, and it's buying, buying, buying. I think that that attitude is still there, but the materials changed into where it's ""My carbon footprint's lower, my music taste is better, I visited more countries than you."" The quest for status is still there. CNN: What are some of the entries that elicited the most negative responses and really pushed people's buttons? Lander: One was written by Miles. Now Miles is Asian, and I can't stress that enough. He wrote post No. 11, which is ""White People Like Asian Girls."" That has been by far the most commented on. The other ones have all been pretty level in terms of drawing responses from people. CNN: What are some of the things that have been rejected from the list? Lander: People send in stuff all the time, and one of the things is that people just don't get what I am going for here. They send in [suggestions such as] guns, NASCAR, trailer parks -- these old stereotypes that are not what I'm after. The one I reject a lot is people say, ""Well, you know what, 'Stuff White People Like' should be on the list of 'Stuff White People Like.' "" I'm just like, ""All right, postmodern hero, you're not the first person to send this in. I'm not putting it on the list."" CNN: Entry No. 92 is book deals, so we are assuming you like that one. What are some other things on the list you like? Lander: There are things that I like that I am ashamed that I like. My favorite entry, which I wrote and where I attack myself the most, is ""Knowing What's Best for Poor People."" That was one that definitely applies to me, and I sort of recognize the ego that's behind that one and how ridiculous that one is. CNN: What's some stuff white people don't like? Lander: Other white people. That's it. The wrong kind of white people. CNN: Who are the wrong kind of white people? Lander: Anyone you blame for everything that's wrong in America are the wrong kind of white people. Not only do they hate them because they create all of these problems, but if those kinds of people start liking anything on this list, they immediately become unacceptable. CNN: Stephen Colbert made the list, and he's renowned for making fun of the right wing. Do you consider yourself a type of Stephen Colbert for the lefties? Lander: I don't know because Stephen Colbert, in his heart of hearts, is a lefty and so am I. I consider myself a self-aware, left-wing person who's not afraid to recognize the selfishness and contradictions that come on the left. I think a lot of people who are on that side really fail to do that a lot of the time. I think the people I write about here are very, very self-righteous and believe that everything they do is right, and they are very resistant to cast a critical eye to themselves. It was really fun for me to write in a cathartic way, sort of like I am attacking my own pretentiousness and my own ridiculousness. It's just amazing because these people are so self-aware but so unaware at the same time.","Popular ""Stuff White People Like"" blog now a book .

"(CNN) -- A company due to take over the management of one of the venues used in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa has pulled out of the deal after miscalculating the running costs. The Sail Stadefrance Operating Company (SSOC) -- a partnership between South African events company Sail and French consortium Stadefrance -- were due to take up a 30-year lease on Cape Town's Green Point Stadium on November 1 this year. But Cape Town's residents could now end up paying for the $600 million stadium -- as the management of the venue transfers to the city in January 2011. SSOC chairman Morne du Plessis said that the company had incorrectly anticipated the amount it would take to run and maintain the stadium, estimated at around $6 million per year. ""In the light of unresolved matters that affected the viability of the lease we have advised the city that SSOC would not be in a position to enter the lease,"" du Plessis told the official website of the city of Cape Town. ""Shareholders were not prepared to enter the lease under circumstances that projected substantial losses."" The SSOC had been managing the stadium on behalf of the city since January 2009, apart from during the World Cup when the tournaments' organizing committee were in charge. Eight World Cup matches were held at the 68,000-seat Green Point, one of five new stadiums built for the World Cup this summer. Tournament CEO Danny Jordaan promised South Africans that the new facilities would not become ""white elephants"" and would leave a legacy for generations to come. ""To ensure a lasting legacy and the commercial viability of the stadiums, they will be used for both rugby and soccer,"" Jordaan said before the World Cup. ""This country has also used sports stadiums for major political rallies, concerts and church events. They can, therefore, also be used for outside of sport,"" he added. And despite the setbacks with the future of the Cape Town stadium as well as the burden it may place on the city's taxpayers, acting executive mayor of the city Alderman Ian Neilson has assured residents that future events will take place there as planned. This includes national football team Bafana Bafana's upcoming match against the U.S. on November 17. ""While the current management deal has now fallen through, we also see new opportunities and will now engage directly with the relevant sporting codes in the City on how we jointly take forward the future of the Cape Town Stadium,"" Neilson told the city's official website.","Company pulls out of a deal to take over the running of Cape Town's World Cup stadium .

"(CNN) -- Pirates have commandeered a Taiwanese-flagged fishing boat off the coast of Africa, the European Union's Naval Force in Somalia announced on Friday. The naval force said the Feng Guo No. 168 departed from Port Louis, Mauritius, on October 1, with 14 crew members onboard, including a Taiwanese captain and sailors from Vietnam, China and Indonesia. The vessel was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden, about 250 nautical miles from Madagascar. That location makes the incident the southernmost act of piracy since the European Union began its first-ever naval response, Operation ATALANTA, in December 2008, according to the naval force. The force said the operation exists to combat piracy and protect vulnerable ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, especially merchant vessels carrying humanitarian aid from the World Food Program and the African Union Mission in Somalia. Somali pirates now hold 18 ships and 383 hostages after snatching the Feng Guo No. 168, the naval force said.","Pirates take over Taiwanese boat with 14 crew on board, says EU's naval force .

"(CNN) -- UEFA have promised a ""full and thorough investigation"" into the violence that forced Italy's Euro 2012 qualifying match with Serbia to be abandoned on Tuesday night. Disturbances around the ground in Genoa meant kick-off had to be put back 35 minutes and once the match started Serbian supporters threw flares onto the pitch and let off fireworks. Referee Craig Thomson stopped play after just six minutes when visiting fans hurled a flare towards Italy goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano and the match was quickly called off. Police and firefighters struggled to contain the Serbian fans, who threw objects at their Italian counterparts, cut protective netting and tried to smash Perspex barriers. AFP reported that 16 people had been hospitalized and 17 arrested on what Italy coach Cesare Prandelli told reporters had been a ""night of torment."" On Wednesday AFP said Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told reporters: ""I have just received a phone call from Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, who presented a formal apology from the government."" Jeremic vowed ""to intensify the search for those responsible and to capture the criminals who will be punished to set an example,"" Frattini added.

Work is in progress at the 5.6km site of the future South Korean Grand Prix in Yeongam county. The 19-race season will open in Bahrain on March 14 and the final race will take place in Brazil. After missing out on staging a grand prix in 2009, Canada will return to the circuit in 2010 with a June 13 date if agreement could be reached with Formula One Management which holds the sport's commercial rights. If that is not completed then the Turkish Grand Prix will be moved back one week to the June 6 slot. South Korea is spending millions of dollars on a track in Yeongam county and officials are confident the Korean Grand Prix, set for October 17, will quickly make its mark. Work is in progress at the 5.6km site, 320km south of Seoul, where seating to accommodate 135,000 spectators is being built. Organizers say the main circuit will include Asia's longest straight stretch of 1.2km which will allow speeds of up to 320km per hour.

"(CNN) -- Linguists announced Monday they have identified an endangered language known as Koro that is spoken by about 800 people in northeast India. The language was unknown to science and recently came to light during an expedition by linguists traveling in India on fellowships for National Geographic, the linguists said in telephone interviews. Koro belongs to the Tibeto-Burman language family, which is composed of a group of about 400 languages spoken primarily in east, central, south and southeast Asia and includes Tibetan and Burmese, according to linguist K. David Harrison. Some 150 Tibeto-Burman languages are spoken in India alone, but no other language has been identified as closely related, said Harrison, an associate professor of linguistics at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Like most languages, Koro is unwritten and transmitted orally. It is neither a dialect nor a sister language close to Hruso-Aka, despite being considered such by both Hruso and Koro people. Koro shares some vocabulary with other languages spoken in the region but shares more features with languages spoken farther east, such as Milang and Tani, the linguists said in a news release issued by National Geographic. Harrison and another National Geographic Fellow, Greg Anderson, led the expedition, called Enduring Voices, which brought Koro to light. Enduring Voices documents vanishing languages and cultures and assists with language revitalization. Harrison and Anderson, director of the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages, in Salem, Oregon, focused on Arunachal Pradesh, a remote area of northeast India that is considered the black hole of the linguistic world. It is a language hotspot where there is room to study rich, diverse languages, many unwritten or documented. A permit is required to visit, few linguists have worked there and a reliable list of languages has never been drawn up. ""On a scientist's tally sheet, Koro adds just one entry to the list of 6,909 languages worldwide. But Koro's contribution is much greater than that tiny fraction would suggest,"" Harrison writes in his book, ""The Last Speakers."" ""Koro brings an entirely different perspective, history, mythology, technology and grammar to what was known before."" In the news release, the linguists described their discovery as bittersweet: Of the approximately 800 people who speak Koro, few are under the age of 20, meaning the language is endangered. ""We were finding something that was making its exit, was on its way out,"" Anderson said. ""And if we had waited 10 years to make the trip, we might not have come across close to the number of speakers we found."" The team set out in 2008 in Arunachal Pradesh to document Aka and Miji, languages spoken in a small district there. The expedition went door to door among homes propped up on stilts to reach potential speakers of those little-known languages. While recording the vocabularies, they detected a third language -- Koro. It was not listed in Indian language surveys, Indian censuses or standard international registries. ""We didn't have to get far on our word list to realize it was extremely different in every possible way,"" Harrison said. The inventory of sounds and the way these sounds were combined to form words were distinct from other languages spoken in the region. An Aka speaker would call a pig ""vo"" and a Koro speaker would call a pig ""lele."" ""Koro could hardly sound more different from Aka,"" Harrison writes. ""They sound as different as, say, English and Japanese."" Anderson and Harrison said Aka is the traditional language of the region's historic slave traders, and they hypothesized that Koro may have sprung from the slaves; though they said more study is needed to determine the origin. The project reports that a language becomes extinct every two weeks. By 2100, it is estimated that more than half of the 6,910 languages spoken on earth will vanish. The team will return to India to continue studying Koro in November.","Koro is spoken by only about 800 people, few of them under the age of 20 .

"Washington (CNN) -- The inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security is asking airports to deliver personal information on workers who have access to secure or sensitive areas. A memo sent to airport security badge offices by a senior analyst at the department is asking for the names, Social Security numbers, birthdates and 13 other personal data points in a review of the Transportation Security Administration's credentialing process. The procedure for obtaining the information and the number or type of workers to be covered were not immediately known Thursday. The request  is not timed to the busy Thanksgiving travel season. It appears to be a test of TSA security procedures. The information is due to the Department of Homeland Security by November 22. Airports Council International, which has 575 members worldwide, is urging its member airports to hold off on sending the information until more guidance is available. A Homeland Security annual performance plan called for the information. ""TSA has the statutory responsibility for requiring employment investigations, including a criminal history record check and a review of available law enforcement databases and other records for individuals who have unescorted access to the secure areas of airports and aircraft,"" it said. A transportation official familiar with the request told CNN it came in late Wednesday afternoon, giving airports just two business days before the busy Thanksgiving week to comply. One major U.S. airport may have as many as 40,000 to 50,000 badged workers, the official said. Airports submit monthly information to the TSA, but the request this week requires additional information and the agency is not being flexible, the official said. ""This is going to require some heavy lifting by the airports,"" the official told CNN. Airports are already dealing with increased security and are preparing to handle the holiday crush, the official said.","NEW: Airports must provide more worker information than usual .

"(CNN) -- Each morning of his federal kidnapping trial, Brian David Mitchell sings. In the last few days, he has chosen a holiday theme, with ""Silent Night"" or ""Joy to the World' rising from the defense table as Mitchell closes his eyes and rocks slightly -- lost, it appears, in hymns and psalms. The 12 people weighing his fate have witnessed the spectacle from the jury box. They will soon have to determine whether the man accused of snatching 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart from her bed at knifepoint and holding her captive for nine months is legally insane, as his lawyers claim, or a calculating kidnapper. Mitchell's attorneys are mounting an insanity defense, which requires them to prove he was so mentally ill when he snatched Smart that he did not understand the wrongfulness of his actions. U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball has adjourned the trial until after the Thanksgiving holiday, when Mitchell's defense team will continue its case, and present expert testimony in support of the insanity claim. Mitchell's attorneys have called witnesses to describe his increasingly isolated and odd behavior. But many have also described the 57-year-old as intelligent and resourceful; someone with a salesman's knack for persuasion. Through tears Friday, Mitchell's legal wife said again and again that she'd been manipulated by him. Wanda Barzee was called to the stand as a defense witness, but it was her cross examination by the prosecution that dramatically punctuated the week of proceedings. She is currently medicated and undergoing therapy for her own mental illness. Barzee, who is serving a 15-year sentence for her role in Smart's abduction, said she was present while Mitchell kept Smart tethered to a metal cable at a mountain camp above Salt Lake City. Barzee said Mitchell played on her strong religious convictions, using ""revelations"" and ""priesthood blessings"" to sway and appease her. When she complained about his heavy drinking, Mitchell said he'd had a divine revelation that condoned it, she testified. Her heart broke at the thought of sharing him with other wives. He placed his hand on her head and delivered a blessing, telling her weakness would result in eternal consequence, she claimed. He smoked and read Hustler Magazine,'because in order to rise above all things, he told her they had to sink below them. ""He's a good liar, isn't he?"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Felice Viti asked. Barzee agreed: ""He's a great deceiver."" The battle over Mitchell's mental state has played out in state and federal courts over the years. In February 2005, after failed plea negotiations with Utah prosecutors, Mitchell began his courtroom singing, according to court documents. Later that year, a state court found him incompetent to stand trial. His doctors diagnosed him with ""narcissistic personality disorder,"" and said his illness fell ""within the psychotic spectrum."" In 2008, a federal grand jury indicted Mitchell and Barzee on charges of kidnapping and transportation of a minor across state lines for sexual purposes. The following year, Elizabeth Smart herself took the witness stand at a hearing in federal court to determine Mitchell's competency. U.S. District Court Judge Dale Kimball issued a 149-page written order, finding Mitchell well enough to stand trial. Kimball carefully cited testimony from Mitchell's caretakers at Utah State Hospital's forensic unit, where Mitchell was confined after his arrest. A nursing director testified that Mitchell's unwillingness to work towards restoring his mental competency ""was a huge red flag that he was faking,"" and that ""there was a distinct correlation between Mitchell's singing and his court appearances. ""During his three-year stay at the hospital, Mitchell read dozens of books, yet he never asked for a religious text,"" noted Kimball. ""He especially enjoyed the show Charmed,"" pulling his chair close to the screen whenever the women at the center of the witchcraft drama were scantily clad, the caretakers said. Kimball adopted a skeptical view of Mitchell's convictions, writing that ""the record is replete with examples showing that Mitchell's religious beliefs are not fixed but, rather, used strategically. ""For instance, Mitchell's claim to be a prophet, the Davidic King, or the One Mighty and Strong, manifests only when it serves his own self-interested purpose. When he encountered law enforcement officer or people from whom he could obtain money, food or shelter, he made no such grandiose claims,"" wrote Kimball. ""Mitchell has accurately read and exploited the vulnerability in the system, which protects mentally incompetent persons from standing trial ... stalling the process of his legal case for nearly seven years,"" the judge concluded. The ruling cleared the way for Mitchell's trial to begin about two weeks ago in Salt Lake City's federal courthouse. On the second day of the defense case this week, Mitchell's elderly father made his way to the witness stand with the help of a walker to describe his son's character traits. ""Brian's a very intelligent person and used that to its full extent in the harassment of the other children and my wife,"" he said. The father described him as a sexually curious boy who ""got in trouble playing doctor"" with other children around the age of 8 or 9. To educate his son, the father showed him an old medical book with detailed pictures of genitalia. But the plan backfired, the father said, and Mitchell promptly got into trouble again for playing doctor ""with the rest of the neighborhood."" ""It was ill-advised because it was too explicit, really. I should have known better, but I wasn't always very careful,"" the elder Mitchell testified. Court documents reveal signs of sexual deviance that continued into Mitchell's teens. He was arrested for exposing himself to a 4-year-old girl in the neighborhood. The probation officer assigned to his case called Mitchell's behavior ""bordering on psychotic,"" and referred him to a psychologist who diagnosed ""Behavior Disorder of Adolescence."" Another counselor at the time described Mitchell as an ""excellent manipulator."" Tim Mitchell, the defendant's younger brother, said he watched as a troubled Mitchell grappled to turn his life around and embrace the Church of Latter-day Saints before beginning a steady mental slide, alienating his family and church leaders. ""I said, 'I think you're going off on the wrong way, I think you're drifting away form the church. I think maybe you've been deceived by a false spirit,'"" Tim Mitchell testified. His brother suddenly asked to be called ""Daveed,"" but he refused. ""I just kept calling him Brian."" Their relationship ended after that. ""I started feeling that this is really starting to look like a mental illness and I sent a letter encouraging him to get some help,"" testified Tim Mitchell, a mental health counselor. Mitchell met his wife, Barzee, at a church-sponsored counseling session in 1985, the woman testified Thursday. As she shared her story of an abusive marriage, Mitchell took her hand to comfort her. ""And we've held hands ever since,"" she testified. But eventually, he began to seek out other ""celestial wives,"" she said. In a low, rambling voice that sometimes failed her, Barzee described collapsing crying in her husband's arms when he told her of a revelation to take more wives. When attempts to find a willing bride failed, Mitchell declared they were to use force, she said. ""I was told that we were commanded to take 14-year-old young women and we were to snatch them out of the world and train them up in the ministries of God."" She had concerns about this, she said. ""I knew that the Lord had all power to provide the young women if that was his will, and I know of the pain and suffering that I had been through being separated from my children and I didn't want the young women to be taken away from their family and their friends."" Nevertheless, she strived to be obedient. Mitchell began to ""stalk out"" young girls while panhandling in town, Barzee testified, and on the morning of June 5, 2002, he arrived at their camp with Elizabeth Smart in tow. Smart has described him as preoccupied more with the sexual than the spiritual, raping her multiple times per day, and demonstrating with Barzee the finer points of certain sex acts. If the defense evidence regarding Mitchell's state of mind meets the burden of ""clear and convincing"" in the jury's estimation, he could walk the streets of Salt Lake City again somedayt. If not, he will face a sentence of life behind bars. The defendant himself may not be present to face jurors as they deliver his verdict; he watches the proceedings on a security camera monitor each day, expelled from the courtroom for his steadfast refusal to stop singing.","Brian Mitchell's attorneys are mounting an insanity defense against rape, kidnap charges .

"(CNN) -- A Rutgers University football player remained in intensive care Monday after suffering a spinal cord injury while making a tackle in the fourth quarter of a game against Army on Saturday. Junior defensive tackle Eric LeGrand has no movement below his neck due to the injury at the C3 and C4 level of the spinal cord, according to a statement from the university's athletics department. Doctors at Hackensack University Medical Center performed emergency surgery on LeGrand overnight Saturday to stabilize his injured spine, the university said, but hospital officials declined to comment Monday about LeGrand's injury or condition, citing patient privacy laws. Generally, the higher up on the spine an injury occurs, the more the nervous system is affected. LeGrand's injury occurred in the middle of the neck. Doctors said Monday that with many spinal cord injuries, the first 72 hours after surgery give a good indication of how much function a patient may recover. ""Eric is in good spirits, and we are praying for a full recovery,"" LeGrand's family said in statement. The Scarlet Knights' head football coach, Greg Schiano, affirmed the family's optimism. ""Eric, his family and the Rutgers Football family believe he will recover,"" Schiano said. ""We ask our fans and the entire Rutgers community to believe and pray for Eric as he begins the recovery process."" One of those fans praying for LeGrand is former Penn State University football player Adam Taliaferro. Ten years ago, Taliaferro made a tackle in a game against Ohio State that would alter the course of his life. ""Unfortunately, I had my head down a little bit,"" Taliaferro said, recalling the hit that shattered his C5 vertebrate -- slightly lower on the spinal cord than LeGrand's injury. ""I went to roll over to get up, and nothing happened. I said, 'Doc, I can't move.' "" After his injury, Taliaferro says, he was mentally in shock. His family and teammates helped him stay positive, but his doctors were cautious. They never told him he wouldn't walk again, but they never said he would, either. ""They don't want to give you false hope, but I was under the impression that said, 'Hey, I am going to get through this thing,' "" Taliaferro said. The weeks went by -- no movement. Until finally, five weeks after his injury, Taliaferro wiggled a toe. ""When I got that movement, that's when I really started to believe that I was going to walk again,"" he said. Four months later, Taliaferro took his first steps. Today, a decade later, he says he walks ""pretty normally"" and works out routinely to maintain the movement he has recovered. He says the benefit of being a football player aided his recovery. ""You're used to working hard. You're in the best shape of your life,"" he said. On Sunday, Taliaferro watched the footage of LeGrand's injury sustained as he made an open field tackle on a punt return. Immediately after the collision, LeGrand is seen on his back with his legs sticking straight out at a 45-degree angle, unmoving except for a shake of his head. ""I watched him moving his head, and like myself, he was probably trying to get up,"" Taliaferro said. ""I certainly 100 percent understand what he was going through laying there."" Last season, as a backup defensive tackle, LeGrand played in all 13 games, according to the Scarlet Knights online roster. In 2008, LeGrand played his first collegiate game against North Carolina. At Colonia High School in New Jersey, LeGrand was a starter on his high school football team.","Eric LeGrand has no movement below his neck .

"(CNN) -- Conflicting reports about a shooting Thursday at Maryland's Johns Hopkins Hospital -- including incorrect information that the suspect had been disarmed and apprehended -- were prevalent in the hours immediately after the incident, highlighting the confusion that initially reigned at the scene. By Thursday evening, Baltimore police said they'd determined that Paul Warren Pardus, 50, of Arlington, Virginia, shot a Johns Hopkins doctor late Thursday morning after becoming distraught over an update he had received about his mother's medical condition. Pardus then retreated to his mother's room, where he fatally shot his mother and then himself, Baltimore police said. The doctor suffered non-life-threatening wounds and is expected to recover, according to police. But earlier, details about Pardus' name, how he died, and even whether he died -- at one point a hospital spokesman said he'd been apprehended, when police said he hadn't -- had been reported differently. People who heard about the incident during the first few hours may be surprised to learn how it turned out. A recap of the reports can help show how the information evolved. -- A shooting was reported at Johns Hopkins at about 11 a.m. By noon, police said that a doctor had been critically injured. Local TV stations were reporting that a suspect had barricaded himself in a room, and that authorities were evacuating the building. -- Shortly after noon, a hospital spokesman said the suspect had been ""subdued and disarmed."" The hospital said the facility was on lockdown, and that people were being asked to stay in their rooms. -- By 12:40 p.m., a police spokesman had said authorities had no suspect in custody, disputing an account given by the hospital. A tactical unit was in the hospital, and the suspect was in a fixed location, police said. The police spokesman also said the wounded doctor, who earlier was listed in critical condition, had suffered non-life-threatening injuries and would recover. -- The hospital spokesman then clarified that the suspect had been ""isolated,"" and that he didn't know whether the suspect had been apprehended. -- By 12:45 p.m., police had said the situation had been ""contained,"" and that only portions of the hospital had been evacuated -- which fit with the hospital's explanation that some people were being asked to stay in their rooms. People outside the hospital, including employees who had left the building, were scared and confused. One worker told a local reporter that her mother, who also worked there, apparently was still inside, having been told to stay put. ""We can't really do anything. We have to wait until they find out what's going,"" she said. ""I really am scared."" Another employee, Cynell Robertson, told WBAL that the moments after the doctor was shot were frightening. ""My boss came running in to tell me to stay put where I am at, [and that] there's a guy running around with a gun and we didn't know what he's going to do,"" Robertson told WBAL before 2 p.m. -- Shortly after 1:30 p.m., a police spokesman said for the first time that the suspect was inside a room with what they believed was a family member, and that the suspect was an African-American male in his mid-30s. Authorities were ""still trying to gain control of the suspect,"" though the situation was contained, he said. -- Around 1:45 p.m., police said they had shot and killed the suspect. About a half-hour later, however, police said the suspect had killed himself in a homicide-suicide. -- By about 3:20 p.m., Baltimore's police commissioner had said that the suspect was Warren Davis, 50. Davis, according to the commissioner, apparently had killed his mother and then shot himself. The incident began, the commissioner said, when the suspect became distraught while he was getting an update on his mother's medical condition. He pulled a pistol out of his waistband, shot the doctor, and then retreated to his mother's room, the commissioner said. -- By 5:20 p.m., police said that the suspect had been using an alias, and that his real name was Paul Warren Pardus. Police said they still believed that the slain woman, Jean Davis, 84, was Pardus' mother. By evening, police explained how they had found Pardus: At about 1:30 p.m., after nearly two and a half hours with no contact with the gunman, officers used a robot to peer into the room. When they detected no movement, police entered to find the suspect and his mother dead, Baltimore Police Commissioner Frederick Bealefeld said.","Thursday's shooting at a hospital in Baltimore triggered conflicting reports .

"Havana, Cuba(CNN) -- Fidel Castro threw his support behind his younger brother and successor, President Raul Castro, in some of his most explicit comments yet about the state of affairs in Cuba. In a meeting with students, Castro said he was ""pleased, because the country is working, despite all of the challenges,"" according to state-run website Cubadebate. Raul Castro has begun a radical shakeup of the Soviet-style economic model, announcing the elimination of 1 million state jobs and the expansion of private business. He called for a meeting of the Communist Party next April, the first Congress in almost 14 years ­ to decide how to ""modernize"" the economy without giving up on socialism. Fidel Castro has studiously avoided all mention of domestic affairs since illness forced him to step down in 2006. He re-appeared on the public stage in July, but has focused on international issues, fueling speculation that he was at odds with his brother over the economic changes. Fidel met with students on Wednesday, but the question and answer session was only made public on Thursday. One of the students asked him about the planned Communist Party Congress, referring to his capacity as the first secretary of the party, the only official title that he still holds. Fidel responded that he was not involved as the first secretary, but as ""a soldier of ideas,"" according to Cubadebate. He said: ""I got sick and did what I had to: I delegated my duties. I can't do something if I'm not in the condition to dedicate myself to it all of the time. Not even I knew if I would make it out of that."" It was not clear if that means he will step down as first secretary.","Castro said he was ""pleased, because the country is working, despite all of the challenges""

"(CNN) -- Mexican federal police have arrested a man who authorities say could have been involved in the March shooting deaths of three people with ties to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the country's public safety ministry said. Jose Guadalupe Diaz Diaz, known as ""El Zorro,"" is also suspected in the slaying of a federal police officer, the ministry said in a statement Thursday. Authorities are investigating the 32-year-old's ""likely participation in the killings of three people linked to the U.S. Consulate"" in Juarez, the ministry said. The statement did not specify how Diaz allegedly participated in the shootings. Thursday's statement from Mexican security officials described Diaz as a leader of the Aztecas gang, a street gang affiliated with the Juarez cartel. Mexican authorities have arrested several others they accuse of being connected to alleged killing of three people with ties to the Juarez consulate. The shootings occurred March 13 when consulate employee Lesley Enriquez and her husband, Arthur Redelfs, were gunned down as they left a birthday party in their white SUV. Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of another consulate employee, was killed in a separate vehicle. In addition to his possible involvement in the shootings, Thursday's statement alleged that Diaz was responsible for the distribution and sale of drugs in several locations in the border state of Chihuahua. Also in this week's operation, authorities arrested Reynaldo Diaz Diaz, known as ""El Rey."" The ministry said he provided security for the Aztecas gang, and was suspected in slayings and drug distribution. Police seized a number of weapons including a hand grenade, more than 1,700 rounds of high-caliber ammunition and five bullet-proof vests, the ministry said.","Authorities say ""El Zorro"" is also suspected in the slaying of a federal police officer .

"(CNN) -- Argentina will be missing striker Diego Milito for the final two World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Uruguay as Diego Maradona's struggling team battle to reach the finals in 2010. Diego Milito has had only a bit-part role for Argentina despite his good form for Inter Milan. Milito is expected to be sidelined for the next month after injuring his thigh while playing for Italian champions Inter Milan on Saturday. The 30-year-old was replaced by Mario Balotelli 25 minutes into the 2-1 victory against Udinese at the San Siro, and scans have shown that he suffered a first-degree strain in his right thigh. The Albiceleste go into Saturday's home clash with Peru on a run of four defeats in the last five games which has left the team outside the top-four automatic qualifying spots. While bottom side Peru have no chance of qualifying, Wednesday's opponents Uruguay lie just a point behind Argentina in sixth and will be hoping to at least clinch the play-off position in the South American zone. Milito has made a flying start to his career with Inter this season, scoring five goals in his first seven games, but he has had only a bit-part role in Argentina's qualifying campaign so far. Coach Maradona, who can call on the likes of Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, Carlos Tevez and Ezequiel Lavezzi up front, has retained Boca Juniors striker Martin Palermo in his squad. Palermo scored both goals in the 2-0 friendly win over Ghana last week, and was also on target for his club at the weekend in a 3-2 victory against Velez Sarsfield. Enzo Perez is also added to the 26-man squad after making his debut against the Africans, along with Estudiantes teammate Juan Sebastian Veron and Velez Sarsfield defender Nicolas Otamendi. Colon goalkeeper Diego Pozo, Newell's Old Boys defender Rolando Schiavi, Boca duo Federico Insua and Luciano Fabian Monzon and Huracan midfielder Mario Bolatti are also included among the home-based players.","Argentina striker Diego Milito ruled out of the final two World Cup qualifiers .

"(CNN) -- The captain of the Italian national football team, Fabio Cannavaro, has hit out at his treatment at the hands of the world's media after being cleared of doping by the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI). Fabio Cannavaro has been cleared of doping by the Italian Olympic Committee. The Juventus defender, who led his country to World Cup victory in 2006, failed a drugs test two days after treating a wasp sting with a cream containing cortisone on 28 August. The case against the 36-year-old, whose insect-allergy means that untreated stings could prove fatal, was dropped by CONI's anti-doping prosecutor Ettore Torri after documentation detailing the situation was provided by his club. Torri has a notorious reputation for his hard line stance against doping in sport, having previously charged those who argued positive tests were the result of legitimate circumstances. After the results were announced, Cannavaro criticized how the story had been reported by many areas of the press. ""You get stung by a wasp and then find yourself in the newspaper as if you had been doping,"" Cannavaro said. ""Some newspapers and television channels went too far -- this is the second time in my life that I've found myself gratuitously in the newspapers for a story like this. ""I hope this story does not follow me beyond today. My career has always been distinguished by respect for the rules,"" the footballer told Gazzetto dello Sport. Cannavaro was previously cleared of a similar charge in 1999, when he was videoed inserting a drip into his arm before he went onto to help Parma beat Marseilles to win the Uefa Cup. ""I didn't have any doubt [about the outcome]. ""I am sorry that a matter of this kind stirred up such a fuss. ""My personal history and my career show my respect towards sports and the ethical principles which support it,"" Cannavaro added. Italy sealed their place at the 2010 World Cup with a 2-2 draw against Ireland on Saturday, despite Cannavaro's absence through suspension.

"(CNN) -- Hertha Berlin have reacted to their slump to the bottom of the German Bundesliga by announcing that coach Lucien Favre has been relieved of his duties. Lucien Favre has paid the ultimate price for Hertha Berlin's dismal start to the Bundesliga season. Hertha's 5-1 defeat to Hoffenheim, a result which left them rooted to the foot of the table, was their sixth consecutive league reverse. The club were also knocked out of the German Cup by second division 1860 Munich last week and were held to a 1-1 draw by Lithuanian side Ventspils in their opening Europa League group fixture 10 days ago. Favre's assistant Harald Gamperle has also been relieved of his duties with youth-team coach Karsten Heine appointed on an interim basis. ""Coach Lucien Favre and Harald Gamperle have been relieved of their duties effective immediately,"" said a statement on the club's official Web site. ""The training of the team will be controlled on an interim basis by Under-23 coach Karsten Heine."" Favre took charge just over two years ago and, after consolidating their position in the top flight in his first year, he then led them to an unexpected fourth-placed finish last term. Hertha were even still in the race for the Bundesliga title with two games of the season remaining. However, the loss of key players Andrei Voronin, Marko Pantelic and Josip Simunic this summer and the failure to find adequate replacements has contributed to a terrible start to the season which has cost the Swiss his job. Hertha's only league win this year came on the opening day of the season, when they defeated Hannover 1-0. Since then they have been beaten by Borussia Monchengladbach, Bochum, Werder Bremen, Mainz, Freiburg and Hoffenheim. Crowd figures have also slumped from an average of over 50,000 last season to under 40,000 for their last home game against Freiburg as fans became disillusioned with their side's dramatic slump. Explaining the decision, general manager Michael Preetz told a news conference: ""We are caught in this downward spiral, we have tried to get out of it but unfortunately it has not been possible. ""After the last two large defeats in the Bundesliga we find ourselves in a situation where it has become necessary for Lucien Favre and Harald Gamperle to leave. The board is fully behind my decision.""","Hertha Berlin sack coach Lucien Favre after dismal start to Bundesliga season .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- An experienced diver and master sergeant in the South Korean navy died Tuesday while conducting rescue efforts for 46 seamen who were aboard a patrol ship when it sank, a military official said. The 53-year-old chief master sergeant lost consciousness while underwater in the Yellow Sea, the official said. He was taken aboard a U.S. Navy ship, the USS Salvor, but could not be resuscitated. The 1,200-ton patrol ship Cheonan was carrying 104 sailors when an apparent explosion caused it to capsize Friday night in the Yellow Sea near a disputed maritime border between North and South Korea. Fifty-eight sailors were rescued shortly after the ship capsized, but hopes are fading for the remaining 46. No bodies or survivors have been found since the 58. U.S. divers were on the scene Tuesday and were observing the situation, according to the official. The U.S. divers plan to enter the water on Wednesday, he said. Efforts were under way to pump air into the ship's stern, and ropes were also being attached to the ship to provide divers with some guidance while underwater, the official said. Visibility is poor -- only about a meter (3 feet) -- and the current is about 5 knots (5 mph). South Korean divers were struggling to gain access to stern of the ship, where most of the missing crew members are believed to be, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Tuesday. Defense officials told the news agency access to the stern was hampered by the current. Monday evening was the end of a 69-hour window during which rescuers believed the sailors could survive. Divers have knocked on the hulls of different parts of the ship with hammers, but raised no response. South Koreans have held out hope the crewmen might be rescued, but by Tuesday hopes for a happy ending were fading. Meanwhile, officials were no closer Tuesday to determining the cause of the explosion that sunk the Cheonan. The country's defense minister has said it could have been caused by an old mine. Kim Tae-young told a meeting of the parliamentary defense committee on Monday that one of the many North Korean sea mines placed during the 1950-53 Korean War could have triggered the blast. Yonhap has quoted military officials as saying that the explosion tore a hole in the rear of the ship, shutting off the engine. Citing accounts of rescued sailors who handled the ship's radar, Kim said they reported no signs of a torpedo attack ahead of the explosion. The navy plans to salvage the vessel, which was carrying missiles and torpedoes, to determine what caused the incident, Yonhap reported. President Lee Myung-bak has called for a thorough investigation into the cause of the explosion. Baengyeong Island, the Seoul-administered island near the scene of the accident, is a flash point maritime border area between the Koreas. Given Baengyeong Island's proximity to North Korea, North Korean involvement was feared, but South Korean officials have played down that scenario. North Korea's official media has yet to mention the incident, according to Yonhap, but accused the United States and South Korea of conducting a maritime drill for the purpose of invading North Korea. ""Military tension is intensifying on the Korean Peninsula due to the brazen moves by the U.S. and its war-mongering puppets to provoke a war,"" North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said, as reported by Yonhap. Journalist Andrew Salmon contributed to this report for CNN.","NEW: U.S. divers plan to enter water on Wednesday, official says .

"(CNN) -- Villarreal have sacked coach Ernesto Valverde following Sunday's 2-0 Spanish Primera Liga defeat at home to Osasuna. Valverde only took over at Villarreal in the summer following Manuel Pellegrini's departure to Real Madrid. However, the Yellow Submarines, who finished fifth last year, have had a disappointing season and are 10th in the table following Sunday's loss. ""Villarreal have cancelled their contract with coach Ernesto Valverde after the defeat against Osasuna,"" the club confirmed in a statement on their official Web site. ""The club thank the coach for his services and wish him the best of luck in his sporting career."" Villarreal, who have been linked with former Getafe coach Michael Laudrup, have said they will name Valverde's replacement in the next few days. Despite a recent draw against Barcelona at the Nou Camp, Valverde has paid the price for an inconsistent season which has also seen the club crash out of the Spanish Cup to second division side Celta Vigo. The 45-year-old becomes the sixth coach to lose his job in the Spanish top flight this season following the departures of Abel Resino (Atletico Madrid), Juan Carlos Mandia (Racing Santander), Marcelino Garcia Toral (Real Zaragoza), and Hugo Sanchez and Jose Angel Ziganda (both Xerez). Meanwhile, on the pitch, Sevilla moved up to fourth place in the table as a double from Alvaro Negredo -- the second a superb chip -- earned them a 2-1 home victory over third-placed Valencia. David Navarro headed a late consolation for Valencia but they were unable to prevent Sevilla moving to withing three points of them. In earlier matches, European-chasing Getafe were held to a 0-0 by a Racing Santander side who played almost the entire second half with 10 men after Jose Moratan was dismissed for two bookings. And Atletico Madrid were jeered off by their own fans after slumping 2-0 at home to Malaga, their ninth defeat of the season.","Spanish Primera Liga side Villarreal dismiss coach Ernesto Valverde .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As the deadline nears for U.S. troops to exit major Iraqi cities, units in Mosul are in the midst of a months-long operation to sweep out extremist fighters. U.S. troops have a deadline of June 30 to exit major Iraqi cities. The decision on whether to keep troops in the restive northern city beyond June 30 has been a sticking point between the United States and Iraq. Parts of the city remain under insurgent control and high-profile attacks continue, unlike the vast majority of the country. ""We still have a major operation going inside of Mosul with all forces assisting and helping out. We expect that to end here within about 30 to 45 days, and then there will be a decision to be made,"" the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Raymond Odierno, told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday. ""I was just up there Saturday, and we conducted a joint assessment,"" he said. ""There's some problems that we have to work through but, in fact, there's potential that they [Iraqi forces] can handle the mission"" when they take over in July. Despite concerns about the continuing violence, the government of Iraq said last week it will not extend the deadline for U.S. combat troops to leave Iraqi cities. The joint operation to clear Mosul of insurgents has been going on for 75 days, neighborhood by neighborhood, according to Odierno. ""It's going to take us another 30 days to finish that,"" he said. Mosul has become the last major fighting ground in Iraq as insurgents, mainly al Qaeda, were pushed north out of Baghdad during the U.S. troop ""surge"" that started in 2007. Insurgents were able to entrench in the city as U.S. and Iraqi forces cleared and held Baghdad and other regions. A number of U.S. troops were moved out of Mosul to help with surge operations farther south, leaving Mosul and surrounding areas mainly to Iraqi forces and a smaller U.S. military contingent. While Odierno said the current operations are ""having a good impact,"" in Mosul, continued high-profile attacks haunt commanders there. On May 1 a suicide bomb was detonated near a coffee shop, killing at least six people. Five U.S. soldiers were killed on April 10 when a suicide bomber breached the outer security barrier of Iraqi National Police headquarters in southern Mosul. It was the single deadliest attack on U.S. troops in more than a year, the U.S. military said. Odierno noted the tactic of using women as suicide bombers is being used by insurgents in Mosul. ""We've seen a few in Mosul -- a couple of attacks were connected by Tunisian foreign fighters that came in, we think, through Syria. We actually detained the leader of the cell, so now we're learning more and more about it,"" he said. U.S. and Iraqi forces are also facing a recent increase of attacks in Baghdad, which Odierno and other U.S. military officials pin on al Qaeda trying to again foment sectarian violence. ""We're trying to get inside of these cells. We're trying to understand where they're coming from and we have been successful. We are picking people up,"" the general said. He said the United States has improved its intelligence sharing with the Iraqi forces over the past six months, helping to impair the ability of the insurgents to move around. ""Their [Iraqi forces'] strength is the human intelligence. Our strength comes in other ways. And so we're trying to combine those together so we can work toward solving this problem,"" he said. But with 45 days left until the security agreement with Iraq takes U.S. troops in Baghdad off the streets and back to their bases, there is some uncertainty about how Iraqi forces will contain the current violence. Odierno remains positive. ""There's a potential that this could actually work, if the Iraqis are able to maintain in the cities and we're able to, then, to spend more of our time in the support zones outside of the cities,"" he said. ""We actually could come up with, actually, a stronger method of going after these forces. But we'll have to wait and see.""","Parts of restive northern city remain under insurgent control, attacks continue .

"(CNN)  -- Juventus missed the chance to go top of Serie A as they were held to a last-gasp 1-1 draw by Bologna on Sunday. David Trezeguet celebrates his goal but Juventus were eventually held to a 1-1 draw by Bologna. An equalizer by Brazilian Adailton in injury time earned the visitors a late point after David Trezegeut had given Juve a 25th-minute lead. The French striker profited after Jonathon Zebina's charge into the box which saw his shot come back off Bologna goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano and fall into his path. Diego then set up Trezeguet for a chance which flew just wide. Juve had been on top in the first half but after the break home keeper Gianluigi Buffon was called into action on several occasions. He saved a Giacomo Tedesco shot and Adailton put the rebound over the bar, but three minutes into added time saw Tedesco send a high cross into the box and Adailton volleyed home. ""It's a missed opportunity,"" Juve coach Ciro Ferrara told reporters. ""We have been naive."" ""When they equalized we had no-one defending, we have given them too much freedom. ""We tried to attack in order to kill the game and that gave them a chance to hit back."" Sampdoria head Juventus by one point with 15 points from six games after their 1-0 win over champions Inter Milan on Saturday. Inter are on 13 points with Fiorentina, who beat Livorno 1-0 in Saturday's late game. In other action on Sunday, AC Milan continued their disappointing start to the season with a 0-0 home draw against Bari. Out of sorts Brazilian ace Ronaldinho missed their best chance when he blazed a first half rebound over the bar. The draw left them in 11th place, seven points adrift of Sampdoria. AS Roma needed an injury-time equalizer from Daniele De Rossi to earn a 1-1 draw away to Catania. Takayuki Morimoto gave the home side the lead in the 22nd minute, with Italian international De Rossi leveling in a goalmouth scramble.

"(CNN) -- Heikki Kovalainen prevented practice for the inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix from being an all-British affair as he topped the timesheets after the second session. With three minutes of the session remaining, and with Lewis Hamilton poised to edge out Jenson Button at the top of the standings, Kovalainen ensured it would be a McLaren one-two rather than a British one-two that led the way ahead of Sunday's race. Conditions for the second 90-minute period were markedly different to those in the first as outgoing world champion Hamilton pipped new title-holder Button by just 0.096 seconds. Earlier, as the drivers acclimatised themselves to the new Yas Marina circuit, they basked in temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius. It was still 31 degrees when the second session began at 5pm local time, but on this occasion the following 90 minutes would be played out under a setting sun for the first time in F1 history, and ultimately floodlights as day shifted into night. Ultimately, it was Finn Kovalainen who led the way with a time of one minute 41.307seconds, over 2.5 seconds quicker than Hamilton's best earlier in the day. But that was no surprise as the 20 drivers grew accustomed to the track, culminating in the Finn ending up quicker than his McLaren team-mate by just 0.197 seconds, with Brawn GP's Button 0.234 seconds down on Kovalainen. Sebastian Vettel, looking for a small degree of consolation for the year by finishing second to Button in the championship, was fourth quickest in his Red Bull, 0.284 seconds behind Kovalainen. Toyota's Kamui Kobayashi, who is deputising for the injured Timo Glock, was fifth, followed by Toro Rosso's Sebastien Buemi and Red Bull's Mark Webber, winner in Brazil last time out. The top 10 was completed by Brawn's Rubens Barrichello, who himself has designs on finishing runner-up to his team-mate, with Williams' Nico Rosberg ninth and Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari 10th. BMW Sauber's Robert Kubica finished bottom of the timesheets, but that came after blowing an engine after 13 laps. That is likely to incur a 10-place grid penalty for the race as he has already used the permissible eight engines for the season. Meanwhile, the Williams team have confirmed Cosworth will be their new engine supplier from next season. After recently ending their contract with Toyota ahead of schedule, the news is unsurprising as Williams have long been touted to again join forces with Cosworth after previously working with them in 2006. Team principal Frank Williams told reporters: ""Cosworth have impressed us with the quality of their technical team and convinced us their program will deliver a competitive Formula One engine. ""In addition, like Williams, Cosworth is an independent company whose owners share our passion for racing and engineering. ""We believe that, working together, we will develop not only a competitive racing car for 2010, but also a long-term partnership that can take on the best in Formula One.""","Heikki Kovalainen tops timesheets in practice for Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari President Luca di Montezemolo has dismissed claims that his team's cars carry subliminal tobacco advertising as ""ridiculous."" Reports last week quoted several health professionals as suggesting the red, white and black barcode on Ferrari's Formula One cars and Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso's overalls were a link to Marlboro cigarettes. Tobacco advertising in F1 was outlawed in 2005, yet reports claimed a spokesman for the European Public Health Commissioner said the barcode constituted potential subliminal marketing. The Times newspaper quoted John Britton, a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, as saying the barcode resembled the lower half of a packet of Marlboro cigarettes, and that it was ""creeping branding"". Under a law passed in both Britain and Brussels in 2002, it is an offence for a tobacco company to sponsor a sporting event. Phillip Morris, the owner of Marlboro cigarettes, is a long-standing sponsor of Ferrari, but Montezemolo has described the stories as ""pointless."" He told Ferrari's official Web site: ""Frankly, I find this argument completely pointless and it is verging on the ridiculous to claim that the color red or a graphic design which shows a bar code could induce people to smoke. ""At a time when, on the other side of the Atlantic they are fighting to provide a more equal health service, in the old continent of Europe, so called experts are racking their brains to come up with theories that have no scientific basis: I think there are more important matters to think about than a bar code. ""Therefore, it's best not to waste any more time replying to this sort of nonsense or to those who are instrumental in wanting to stoke up the story.""","Ferrari dismiss claims they subliminally advertise cigarettes as 'ridiculous'

"(CNN)      -- Two teams of scientists say they have found a key area of the H5N1 bird flu virus which seems to be vital to its ability to copy itself, and hope the discovery could lead to new drugs to fight the infection. Human-to-human transmission of avian flu is rare, but in some cases, the virus has passed from poultry to humans. The discovery is generating excitement among scientists who are looking for a new weapon against the bird flu virus that typically kills more than half its human victims. Two separate groups of scientists -- one in China, one in France -- used a highly technical process to identify protein that seems to be involved in its ability to replicate itself. That gives researchers a new target, as they try and develop new medications. The announcements, detailed in the British-based journal Nature, come at an uneasy time for those who follow the bird flu strain called H5N1. So far this disease is mainly affecting birds in some countries and the number of human cases remains small, but the virus has shown no sign of growing milder since it first infected people back in 1997. It continues to decimate bird flocks in sporadic outbreaks, mostly in Asia, and occasionally breaks into the human population. China's Ministry of Health reported eight human cases last month, including four deaths. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has confirmed 404 human cases worldwide. Nearly two-thirds of the victims have died. While H5N1 doesn't make headlines the way it did in 2005, health officials say the continuing severity of the infections means the alarm is still on. Influenza viruses, in general, spread easily. If H5N1 were to acquire the genetic ability to pass easily from person to person, it could turn into a major catastrophe. Many countries have stockpiled both vaccines and antiviral medications, for such a scenario. The same medications that are used to treat regular flu, oseltamivir (Tamiful) and zanamivir (Relenza), also seem to be effective against H5N1. But that's no reason to rest easy. All flu viruses tend to mutate rapidly, which is why the flu vaccine one year, won't protect you against the next year's flu. Those rapid mutations mean the virus tends to develop a resistance to any widely used medication. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, told CNN, ""It always happens that eventually, sooner or later, the [flu] virus will develop varying degrees of resistance. You just hope that it's kept to a minimum."" The findings in Nature may lead to another option to fight bird flu, but an actual new drug is years away. A vaccine could be effective, but they first have to know what strain of flu they're fighting. The current strategy of health officials around the world is to try to contain isolated cases before they spread. The best case scenario would be, that this H5N1 killer remains primarily a disease for the birds.","Experts say they have found key component of the H5N1 bird flu virus .

"(CNN) -- Four people, including three children, were found dead inside a home in a peaceful, family-oriented northwest Florida neighborhood Saturday, police said.

Police have launched a homicide investigation, given the condition of the dead. ""There's obvious violence in the home,"" said McCranie. ""How that violence transpired, we're not sure.""

"(CNN) -- A suspicious piece of luggage that was about to be loaded onto a flight in Namibia was a ""test device"" from a U.S. company that sells products designed to test security, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in a news conference Friday in Hamburg, Germany. Namibian police on Friday warned that whoever is responsible for planting the device among the luggage of an Air Berlin flight Wednesday would be severely dealt with, warning that Namibia was not to be used as an unauthorized testing ground for aviation security. ""The preliminary investigations have revealed that the suspicious parcel does not contain any explosive substances; however, it is an explosive simulation training device, manufactured by an American-based company, 'Larry Copello Incorporated,' "" Lt. Gen. Sebastian Ndeitunga, Namibia's top policeman, told reporters Friday at a news conference in Windhoek, the capital. The device is a training aid to help screeners identify explosive devices, Larry Copello, founder and CEO of Larry Copello, Inc., told CNN Friday. Copello described the device as ""non-hazardous ...not a threat to anyone."" Copello said his company sells such devices to law enforcement agencies, governments and corporate clients, but did not know to whom this particular device was sold. He learned of the Namibia incident on Thursday when the FBI called him. He said he is cooperating with the investigation. An official with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration said Friday that they are working with German and Namibian authorities to determine the origin of the device and the reason it was to be transported on the plane. ""We applaud the vigilance of the aviation security authorities who discovered the device and took quick action to ensure that it did not pose a threat to the aircraft and passengers,"" the TSA official told CNN. A U.S. official said Friday that there doesn't seem to be any connection with any U.S. government entity. The discovery of the bag at Windhoek Hosea Kutako International Airport in Namibia delayed flight 7377 to Munich, Germany, on Wednesday and raised security concerns, a spokeswoman for the airline, Air Berlin, said Thursday. De Maiziere said he believed the device was from a U.S.-based company, but did not know which company. He said no one was warned in advance about the test device. The bag contained a functioning electronic clock with wiring attached, but no explosives. ""Air Berlin has confirmed that there was no explosive material in the laptop bag found in Namibia,"" Sabina Teller, a spokeswoman for Air Berlin, told CNN. ""The luggage was found in the airport, at no point was on the plane. It had no luggage label, so it was impossible to know where it was going, which company it was supposed to fly with or who it belonged to,"" she said . De Maiziere said authorities are investigating the bag's origin and its intended destination. After the bag was discovered, the flight's 296 passengers and all bags were given additional security checks. The plane later landed safely in Munich after a six- or seven-hour delay, Air Berlin spokeswoman Silke Manitz said. Germany raised its threat level Wednesday, saying concrete evidence had emerged of a possible attack planned in Germany later this month. It said there was evidence of persistent efforts by Islamists to launch an attack. A senior German counterterrorism source told CNN on Thursday that the German Interior Ministry warning was linked to recent threats to the country from al Qaeda in Pakistan. Interior Minister de Maiziere addressed the threat level Friday by reiterating that people should go about their lives as usual.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A federal judge pleaded guilty Friday to two counts of drug possession and another charge, admitting he had paid a stripper to buy drugs for the two to use together. Senior U.S. District Court Judge Jack Camp Jr. admitted to giving money to a woman to buy drugs, according to prosecutors. He pleaded guilty to two counts of drug possession, federal prosecutors said. He also pleaded guilty to one count of conversion of government property for giving the woman a government-issued laptop. As part of a plea deal, Camp did not plead guilty to a firearms possession charge included in the initial federal complaint. The plea came shortly after Camp, 67, retired from the judiciary. Federal prosecutors accused Camp of giving Sherry Ann Ramos, 26, money to buy drugs including cocaine, marijuana and roxicodone, which the two then frequently used together. FBI agents arrested Camp on October 1 after he tried to buy drugs from an undercover officer. Camp's attorneys issued a statement saying the judge took responsibility for his actions and would spend the next several months trying to understand the ""uncharacteristic nature of his actions."" He will be sentenced March 4.","A federal judge has pleaded guilty to drug charges .

"(CNN) -- Two armed groups raped more than 150 women in a village in the volatile North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic  of Congo in a four-day spree, a United Nations official said Monday. The attacks happened last month and members of a U.N. human rights team said it confirmed the attacks. ""Victims of the attack, which occurred on 30 July in the village of  Bunangiri are  receiving medical  treatment and have also been provided psycho-social  care,"" the U.N. officials said in a statement. In the statement U.N. officials said the culprits were insurgents loyal to the Democratic  Forces for the Liberation of  Rwanda. The ethnic Hutu militia has been linked the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and has been been battling Congo government forces recently. Aid group International Medical Corps said it is treating the women and had more details about the rape spree that they say went on for days. ""The incident began when armed men entered a local village, urging the population not to flee by convincing them that they were only there to find food. However, after dark another group of armed men reportedly arrived, and over the next four days the armed actors raped women throughout the area,"" the organization said in a statement. The women were attacked by two to six armed men and sometimes in front of their husbands and children, the medical organization said.","Rape spree lasts four days, group says .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- 2009 has given employers and employees a run for their money -- literally. Budgets have been cut, layoffs made and furloughs instituted, and benefits and perks have evaporated. At the beginning of the year, 38 percent of employers said the economy would force them to make administrative cuts sometime during 2009, according to a survey by CareerBuilder.com. Sixty-five percent of those employers indicated that they would cut back company social events, 61 percent anticipated curtailing business travel, 25 percent expected to scale back on health-care benefits and 11 percent planned to reduce wellness benefits. Other areas where companies planned to cut spending included special office perks, such as coffee, ice machines or discounted vending (34 percent), incentive trips (28 percent) and philanthropic activities (21 percent). Such perks and benefits being taken away make for a tough situation for employees. Not only are they working harder to keep their jobs, but workers have to do more for less. While some argue that it's hard to keep employees motivated in this situation, others say that they shouldn't focus on incentives, but rather think about the bigger picture. ""When perks and benefits are taken away, management often does this to allocate resources where they're needed, elsewhere. The money being saved by not buying bagels every Friday or purchasing Christmas gifts for employees may be going towards your salary,"" said Tom Gimbel, founder and CEO of LaSalle Network, a staffing and recruiting firm. ""If you had to choose between taking a salary cut and not having free coffee versus being let go, most employees would likely take the former."" Urmil ""Tracy"" Marshall, coordinator for the Office of Diversity and International Affairs at Fort Valley State University in Fort Valley, Georgia., agrees that it's important not to focus on what is being taken away. She said that due to budgetary constraints, furloughs were implemented at the school; but rather than get discouraged, she focused on the positive. ""I reminded myself how blessed I was to even have a job,"" Marshall said. ""We need to remind ourselves of our priorities in life, placing a greater emphasis on what we have -- not what we don't."" Communication is key . Although it's understandable for employees to be upset, frustrated and discouraged when benefits or perks are taken away, Kevin Sheridan, founder and CEO of HR Solutions, which specializes in helping organizations to keep employees engaged, said that employees are less likely to be upset if management communicates with employees. In fact, 82 percent of employees surveyed in HR Solutions' International Normative Database say that it's important that their organization allow them to choose from a variety of benefits to meet their individual needs. The survey consisted of more than 3.3 million responses from 2,400 organizations. ""If an organization's leadership team simply decided amongst themselves which benefits would be best to cut, employees will commonly become upset and their engagement will be negatively affected,"" Sheridan says. ""Open communication is a key driver of engagement, and employees will immediately recognize the fact that they had no voice in the situation. If leadership had simply asked employees which benefits were important to them, this situation may be avoided."" Attitude is everything . Despite having to deal temporarily with a few displaced benefits or perks, there are benefits to sticking around with your employer until those things are reinstated. ""It's a good time to remember that the perks were never the reason that you liked the job. No one gets up in the morning saying, 'I'm really excited to go to the office because there's free coffee,'"" said Paul Glen, author and management columnist. ""If people feel that the [cuts] are being made in a good-faith effort to save jobs, they will be even more loyal than before, since they believe that the company is working on their behalf -- not just for executives."" Additionally, according to the HR Solutions survey, 37 percent of employees have thought of resigning in the last six months. Twenty-three percent said they thought about leaving because of pay; 18 percent because of a supervisor or manager; 15 percent because of career advancement; and 5 percent because of benefits. Thirty-nine percent considered it for other reasons. ""This statistic is especially important because many organizations have cut benefits over the last six months, and it illustrates that the majority of employees have not thought of resigning as a result of adjusted benefits,"" Sheridan said. ""These employees recognize the advantages of sticking around with a company, benefits or not, for advantages such as career development and compensation. Also, as soon as the economy picks up, many benefits programs will be re-evaluated; employees sticking around with these organizations will not remain without benefits forever."" Workers should also remember that there could be consequences to abandoning a job just because you lost free coffee or a transportation reimbursement. If you're thinking about leaving your job for such reasons, make sure that your missing perks outweigh any possible career advancement or opportunities you would receive if you stayed. ""In this economy, it may be very hard to find another job, and there's no guarantee that one will have free coffee, either,"" Glen said. ""Also, at the new job, even if it is good, the employee will have less tenure and is more likely to be cut in future layoffs."" If you've had benefits or perks taken away in recent months and need help staying motivated, remember these five tips from our experts: . 1. Get over it . ""The longer you talk about it to fellow employees, the longer you will have bad feelings, cause others to have bad feelings and be less productive yourself, which is not what will help the company be able to restore what has been taken away,"" said Aubrey Daniels, author of ""Oops! 13 Management Practices That Waste Time and Money (and What to Do Instead)."" 2. Find motivation . Sheridan encourages employees to find motivation through career planning with supervisors, interacting with co-workers or being proud of where they work. For example, an employee could volunteer to act as a sounding board for job candidates considering employment at the organization. 3. Create your own perks . Nancy Irwin, a motivational speaker and author, said employees can take turns bringing in coffee, bagels or potluck lunches to help fill the void of things that have been cut. 4. Understand what's still offered and take advantage . Darcy Eikenberg, president and chief creative officer of Coach Darcy LLC, recalls a client who didn't sign up for a course because she thought training costs had been eliminated. She realized that a co-worker was taking the course and getting it paid for from tuition reimbursement, an area that hadn't been cut. ""Do a deep dive into your company's programs, policies and even discounts because there's probably something you can use now,"" she said. 5. Focus on the solution, not the problem . Concentrate on actions today that will affect your organization's success and growth tomorrow, said Jonathan Berger, director of human resources at Direct Agents, an interactive advertising company. ""Take this time as an opportunity to offer new ideas to your managers and take an active and entrepreneurial role in helping your company overcome straining times. If you do a good job, you may be rewarded for your efforts when things improve,"" he said. ""In addition, by taking on new challenges and opportunities, you can further develop your skills and make yourself a more valuable asset to any organization."" &copy CareerBuilder.com 2010.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S. military closed its detention facility in southern Iraq on Thursday after a plane carried the last remaining prisoners to another facility in Baghdad. Iraqi detainees walk around Camp Bucca detention centre on May 20, 2008 . The United States has been releasing detainees or transferring custody to the Iraqi government, a goal spelled out in the bilateral security agreement negotiated last year between the two nations. Since February, the Americans have released about 750 detainees from its detention facilities and transferred 200 more to Iraqi authorities each month, the military said. Camp Bucca, in the southern port city of Basra, was one of three prisons operated by U.S.-led forces in Iraq. The other two are Camp Cropper, adjacent to the Baghdad airport, and Camp Taji, just north of the capital. Both camps are scheduled to be handed over to the Iraqis next year. The last 180 detainees from Bucca were airlifted by military transport early Thursday morning to one of those two other facilities. A total of 8,305 detainees still remain in U.S. custody, about half the number at the start of the year. ""I'm pleased to say the Camp Bucca detention facility is now closed,"" said Brig. Gen. David Quantock, the commander of the task force handling the detainee releases and transfers.","U.S. miliary closes Camp Bucca, a detention center in southern Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid snatched a 3-2 victory at Valencia to remain five points behind Spanish leaders Barcelona, who triumphed 1-0 in the Catalan derby with Espanyol earlier on Saturday night. Real, missing the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, needed an 83rd-minute winner from substitute defender Ezequiel Garay as all five goals came in the second half at the Mestalla. Madrid had twice gone ahead through Garay's fellow Argentinian Gonzalo Higuain but Valencia -- who won last season's corresponding fixture 3-0 -- battled back through Spain striker David Villa and Joaquin Sanchez. Sergio Ramos headed against the post in the first half, but Real suffered a big blow when fellow defender Pepe was stretchered off just before the interval after the Portugal international fell awkwardly. Higuain, who turned 22 on Thursday, headed the opening goal from Karim Benzema's cross nine minutes after the break, but Villa leveled six minutes later as he headed in off the underside of the crossbar from Jeremy Mathieu's cross to make up for David Navarro's close-range miss just beforehand. Marcelo then set up Higuain for his eighth goal this season -- all of which have come in the past seven games -- but substitute Joaquin beat goalkeeper Iker Casillas at his near post in the 80th minute. However, Garay's glancing header from Xabi Alonso's free-kick kept Real in touch with Barca, who have played one more match. The Spanish and European champions needed a controversial penalty from Zlatan Ibrahimovic to edge past their city rivals Espanyol at the Nou Camp. The Swede slotted his 11th league goal this season, one behind top scorer Villa, after Xavi went down in the area despite minimal contact from former Barcelona youth player Raul Baena six minutes before halftime. The hosts started with Thierry Henry in the absence of injured European player of the year Lionel Messi, but the Frenchman and Ibrahimovic were unable to take advantage of several chances. Pep Guardiola's team will now head to Dubai for the FIFA World Club Cup, where they will meet Atlante in the semifinals following the Mexican team's 3-0 win against New Zealand champions Auckland on Saturday. Espanyol suffered a fifth straight defeat, but cannot end the weekend in the relegation zone thanks to Real Zaragoza's 2-1 defeat at home to Athletic Bilbao earlier on Saturday. The Basque side bounced back from last weekend's 2-1 home defeat to Valencia to go seventh above Sporting Gijon, who host fourth-placed Sevilla on Sunday. Sevilla are one point behind Valencia, who trail Barcelona by 11 and Real by six.","Real Madrid win 3-2 at Valencia to remain five points behind Spanish leaders Barcelona .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexican officials said they have identified two suspects in this week's slayings of two Americans in northern Mexico. Mourners carry the coffin of Benjamin LeBaron, 32, on Thursday in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. A security camera at a toll booth near the municipality of Galeana captured images of the suspects, Chihuahua state Attorney General Patricia Gonzalez Rodriguez said Thursday, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Gonzalez declined to name the suspects, other than to say they belong to a crime organization known as ""La Linea"" (The Line). The toll booth cameras show four trucks or sport utility vehicles in which 12 suspects were riding, she said. No arrests had been reported by Friday. Benjamin LeBaron, 32, and his brother-in-law, Luis Widmar, who was in his mid-30s, were beaten and shot to death after armed men stormed into their home Tuesday morning in Galeana. Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the Chihuahua attorney general's office, said earlier this week that a note was found on LeBaron's body but he could not confirm the contents. Local media reported the note indicated the slayings were in retribution for the capture of 25 drug suspects in a nearby town. LeBaron's younger brother, Eric, was kidnapped in May and returned unharmed a week later. The kidnapping prompted LeBaron to become a nationally recognized anti-crime activist who moved the local community to take a stand. ""There are no leaders here, or we are all leaders,"" LeBaron's brother Julian LeBaron told CNN affiliate KINT-TV in El Paso, Texas, this week. ""If they kill my brother, another three will take his place. And if they kill us, another hundred will take their place. We are not giving up. No way."" The LeBaron brothers belonged to the ""Community of LeBaron"" in the municipality of Galeana, a township founded by ex-communicated Mormons. CNN's Mayra Cuevas-Nazario contributed to this report.","Gunmen killed Benjamin LeBaron and brother-in-law this week in northern Mexico .

"Lisbon, Portugal (CNN) -- The most important NATO summit in its 61-year history -- according to NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen -- began Friday in Lisbon, Portugal. NATO was founded by the United States and 14 other nations after World War II. But it has grown to 28 members, and is now seeking to shed its Cold War identity by adopting a new ""strategic concept,"" framing new threats the alliance faces and the means to combat them. But getting 28 nations on the same page about how to address a range of new evolving threats will not be easy. The document to be considered this weekend is the product of a set of recommendations from a group of experts led by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The last strategic concept was drafted in 1999. The new document reflects new realities for NATO and the world. The original NATO existed during the Cold War for the collective defense of 15 nations against Soviet aggression. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder likes to call that NATO 1.0. NATO 2.0 marked the period between the end of the Cold War and the present. This stretch saw NATO enter wars in Bosnia and Kosovo and embrace former Soviet republics in Eastern Europe that were looking West. At Lisbon, NATO hopes to move into what Daalder calls 3.0 status, meant for operating in a globalized world. NATO still has the core mandate to provide collective security for all its members, said Daalder, but now must address new threats to Europe's security -- threats not as much from Russia, but from possible terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, attacks on energy infrastructure and piracy on the high seas. This new definition of what constitutes a threat calls into question the future of Article Five of the NATO charter, which considers an attack on one member an attack on all. For an alliance whose mantra is ""collective security,"" the provision is the critical binding agent. Article Five was invoked for the first time after September 11, 2001, when all NATO members agreed the attack was a visible threat to the security of the entire alliance. But the definition of what constitutes a threat to all NATO allies is becoming less recognizable, say some experts. NATO's makeover also expands its battlefield well beyond Europe. The mission in Afghanistan is the largest and most recent example. But NATO is also providing support to efforts to combat piracy in the Indian Ocean and there is serious talk that the alliance could send forces to the Middle East if the Israelis and Palestinians ever reach a peace deal. The expansion of NATO's role into a global force, however, is somewhat at odds with the economic realities facing its members, more than half of which are cutting defense spending. NATO officials worry such a reluctance to invest in the alliance not only diminishes Europe's ability to contribute, it also increases the likelihood of the United States going it alone. Kurt Volker, who served as NATO ambassador from 2008-2009, said not all NATO members want to be the world's policemen. ""In some ways, the United States and Europe are pulling in opposite directions,"" Volker said. ""The United States sees problems and strategic issues outside the NATO area they want NATO to address and wants a more global NATO. But a lot of European countries still view NATO as about Europe and the European space."" At Lisbon, the United States wants NATO leaders to agree to plans for a missile defense shield to defend against ballistic missiles. The Bush administration plan to deploy a long-range anti-missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic angered Russia, which feared the goal was to undermine its nuclear deterrent. The Phased Adaptive Approach proposed by the Obama administration would deploy a continent-wide interceptor-missile system clearly aimed at defending against any missile threat posed by Iran. That's more palatable to Russia, but NATO-member Turkey, which could be one of the sites for the radar systems, doesn't want to upset its growing ties with Iran. Cooperation on missile defense is just one way NATO will seek to close the post-Cold War chapter of its history. When NATO leaders meet this weekend with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, they plan to endorse a new Russia/NATO partnership to work on issues such as terrorism, Afghanistan and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Since the late '80s NATO has struggled with how to transform its sometimes schizophrenic relationship with Russia, its former enemy. At times, Russia has played nice. It was instrumental in helping end the Bosnian war and even sent forces under U.S. command. When the dust settled in Kosovo, Moscow sent troops as part of NATO's KFOR mission. But Russian troops still occupy Georgian territory after clashes there in 2008 and Moscow still maintains a sphere of influence over other countries in its neighborhood. The Soviet Union may be no longer, but fear of the Russian bear still looms large in Eastern European members of NATO who want protection from a resurgent Russia. NATO officials acknowledge there are trust issues to overcome with Russia. Still, they hope the substantial common interests NATO shares with Russia make cooperation possible. In Lisbon, NATO and Russian officials hope to release a joint assessment of threats and lay out their priorities for cooperation. Still, Volker said, ambiguity in the relationship between Russia and NATO remains. ""We never did a good job in making clear there is no reason why Russia couldn't be a member of NATO,"" said Volker. ""If they really became a democracy and market economy, if they believe in freedom, rule of law and human rights, why the heck not?"" NATO's mission in Afghanistan is a litmus test for the future of NATO, say some experts. The military campaign against the Taliban has regained momentum and the summit is expected to announce plans for a transfer of control to Afghan forces by the end of 2014. But the ability of NATO to build the Afghan government has proven less successful. While NATO forces are increasingly successful against the Taliban, it remains very unclear whether Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government will be able to sustain the ""holding and building"" of the provinces once they are transferred. NATO's presence in Afghanistan has lasted nine years. But while all NATO allies have contributed in Afghanistan, their commitments are sometimes limited or inconsistent. Even larger countries like Germany, Italy and Spain have caveats that their troops only serve in areas of limited combat. Many others have withdrawn entirely in the face of public opposition. If Afghanistan ends well, NATO allies in Europe may well consider future missions beyond its borders. If the mission fails, Europe could conclude the experiment was a mistake and stick closer to home and the United States could conclude that NATO is not a reliable partner. The Albright panel warned early in its recommendations that ""Threats to the alliance come from the outside, but the organization's vigor could be as easily sapped from within.""","Most important NATO summit in its 61-year history, says secretary general .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- California's director of adult prisons is recommending against ""compassionate release"" for a terminally ill former Manson family member, a spokeswoman said. Susan Atkins is led from a Los Angeles grand jury room after her indictment in the 1969 ""Manson murders."" Suzan Hubbard, director of the Division of Adult Institutions, decided that Susan Atkins' request should not be sent to the sentencing court for consideration, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Hubbard's recommendation is advisory and will not necessarily prevent Atkins' release. The court -- not the department or the state Board of Parole Hearings -- has the final say on whether Atkins should be released, Thornton said. ""They're the only ones legally who can recall the sentence,""  she added. Atkins, 60, was convicted in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and four others. She had been incarcerated at the California Institution for Women in Corona, California, but has been hospitalized since mid-March. Her request is now before the Board of Parole Hearings, which is conducting an independent investigation and will hear the case during its monthly public meeting, Thornton said. The next meeting is scheduled July 15. Atkins had been held for years at the Corona prison, which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law, and sent her request to the corrections department. The Board of Parole Hearings will receive public comment, discuss the request in closed session and then announce its recommendation. The board also can decide whether to refer the request to the sentencing court. The court, based in Los Angeles, can either grant or deny Atkins' request. It also can recall her life sentence and resentence Atkins to a lesser term, allowing for her to be paroled. In 2007, the department received 60 compassionate release requests, Thornton said. Ten were approved. Citing privacy rules, prison officials would not disclose the nature of Atkins' illness. Her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, has been quoted as saying she has terminal brain cancer, according to a blog called Manson Family Today. She also has had a leg amputated, the Los Angeles Times has reported. Atkins, known within the Manson family as ""Sadie Mae Glutz,"" has been in prison since 1971 and has been denied parole 11 times. She is California's longest-serving female inmate. Tate and three houseguests were slain in August 1969 by killers who burst into her Benedict Canyon home. A teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage on the property also was killed. According to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was 8½ months pregnant, and wrote the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. The following night, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain in their home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. The two-day crime spree sent shock waves throughout Los Angeles. All of the killers remain behind bars. Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman. Atkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence. Her punishment was changed to life in prison when the California Supreme Court ruled the state's death penalty unconstitutional in 1972. Atkins is a born-again Christian, according to a Web site maintained by her husband. During her incarceration, the site says, Atkins has worked to help at-risk youth, victims of violent crimes and homeless children. Last month, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there. Nothing was found, police said.","Decision puts case in parole board's hands, spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's short-list of targets for the vacant national manager's job has been cut by one after Bayern Munich coach Louis Van Gaal distanced himself from the role. The Dutchman was named alongside Russia boss Guus Hiddink, former Ghana coach Ratomir Djukovic, ex-England under-21 manager Peter Taylor and Bruno Metsu as the Nigeria Football Federation's preferred candidates to replace the demoted Shaibu Amodu. The 58-year-old has previous international experience following a two-year spell in charge of the Netherlands, but made it clear that he wants to see out his contract with German giants Bayern, which runs until June 2011. ""I have had an offer from Nigeria now, but I have rejected it,"" Van Gaal told German television channel Liga Total. ""It was not the first time I have received an offer from Nigeria, but I think that Bayern is a big challenge for me."" However, Van Gaal told German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that he would one day like to coach another national side. ""I think Bayern could be my final club. I would like to play a part in the World Cup, or similarly at a UEFA Euro tournament,"" he said. ""I am looking forward to experiencing these tournaments."" The NFF announced last Friday that Amodu's third spell in charge had come to an end despite the 51-year-old leading the Super Eagles to the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations, where they lost to Ghana. Amodu has been relegated to handling the ""B"" team ahead of the 2011 African Nations Championship. The NFF said on its Web site that its list of candidates must be screened and whittled down to a final group of three by the end of February. Hiddink's future as Russia coach is uncertain after the team failed to qualify for the World Cup in South Africa in June, and his contract runs out this year, but media reports suggest the Dutchman does not want the Nigeria job. Frenchman Metsu is now head of Qatar's national team, but made his reputation by guiding Senegal to a shock win over champions France at the 2002 World Cup. Djukovic took Ghana's Black Stars past the group stage of the 2006 World Cup but quit after a second-round defeat by Brazil, then had a two-year spell with China's under-23 Olympic team before taking charge of his native Serbia's under-21 side last July. Taylor has been without a job since October when he was sacked by English third division team Wycombe. He has had two separate spells with the England under-21 side, and was caretaker manager of the senior side for one match against Italy in 2000 when he gave David Beckham the captain's armband. Meanwhile, Benin have sacked coach Michel Dussuyer after failing to progress past the first round of the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola last month, finishing third in Group C after a draw and two defeats. The Frenchman's players and staff have also been dismissed by the Benin Football Federation. ""A decision has been made to dissolve the national team and its technical supervision,"" it said in a statement. ""In the decision, taken by members of the executive committee, they took into account the indiscipline, lack of patriotism and lack of team results at the African Nations Cup. ""The federation, in conjunction with the sports ministry, will set up a new code of conduct and now start out on a new basis with all players who are called into the national team in the future."" Pre-tournament favorites the Ivory Coast, who surprisingly lost to Algeria in the quarterfinals, will play fellow World Cup qualifiers South Korea in a friendly in England on March 3. The match will be played at the Loftus Road, ground of London club Queen's Park Rangers.","Bayern Munich coach Louis Van Gaal distances himself from vacant Nigeria manager's role .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- With foreclosures and bankruptcy affecting millions of homeowners, CNN's Larry King on Tuesday talked to several experts in the real estate industry to get advice on handling the mortgage meltdown. Barbara Corcoran says homeowners have ways of getting mortgage companies to pay attention to them. His panel on ""Larry King Live"" was made up of real estate expert Barbara Corcoran, correspondent Michael Corbett, developer Jorge Perez, real estate magnate Donald Trump and financial expert Robert Kiyosaki. Larry King: Is this a good time to sell a house? Barbara Corcoran: Of course it's not a good time to sell a house. The question is, if you must sell a house, how do you unload it, considering the enormous competition that's out there?  Watch the panelists respond to questions » . King: Suppose you have to sell. Corcoran: There's one way you can always sell a house in any old market. You can intentionally under-price it. If you go out to your own marketplace and intentionally under-price your home 20 percent to 25 percent less than you think it's worth, or that a credible appraiser tells you it's worth, you will sell that house within the week. There's no such a thing as an unsellable house. It's always a question of numbers. King: What's the biggest mistake people facing foreclosure make? Michael Corbett: The biggest mistake right now is when you get that default notice, you ignore it. People think that if they just ignore it, it will buy them more time. It's absolutely the opposite. The first thing they should do when they get those notices is contact either the lender or go to HUD [the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]. Get a certified counselor. There's free counseling out there for people, because if you just go ahead and ignore these notices, they automatically trigger legal action. And that moves it faster. If you want to buy some time, call the lender, call a counselor. King: Let's take a call from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Caller: I have a loan with Countrywide, and they will not refinance our interest-only loan, because they say our debt-to-income ratio is too high, and their workout department won't even look at us because we've never been behind on our mortgage and we're not currently behind. It's going to reset in August. What can we do? Corbett: Unfortunately, a lot of the mortgage companies and the banks don't want to talk to you. It's very sad, until you're actually in arrears. Their loss mitigation or their workout department, they don't want to help you until you're two months or three months in debt. King: Barbara has a solution. Corcoran: I have a solution, and it's a fall-back solution, but it sure gets attention. You can make an appointment, or not make an appointment, go over there with the deed to your property and the keys to your front door and say, OK, I've had it. Here's my deed, here's my keys, and you'll get attention. One other thing, you should always put your requests by certified mail. By law, the banks don't have to answer phone calls. But by law, they have to answer certified mail, and a lot of people don't use it. King: We have an e-mail question from S.O.S. in California: ""I got a condo in April of 2005 for $500,000. Now it's only worth about $400,000. Could I refinance it to get a better interest rate, or should I try to negotiate with the mortgage company to adjust the payment?"" Jorge Perez: I would definitely negotiate with the mortgage company. Lenders are having tremendous problems right now. They have a huge amount of REOs, real estate-owned properties, and they do not want your house or condominium. We are advising all the people that we know that have those problems to go talk to their lenders, and they will talk to their lenders. I think one of the biggest problems, nevertheless, is that a lot of people borrowed on variable rate interests when they had mortgages at 1 and 2 percent that grew up over time. And their jobs have not gotten better, and now they're paying much higher interest rates than when they got their mortgages. And this is a big, big problem in real estate today . King: We have an e-mail question from Debbie in Orlando, Florida: ""What's a family to do if they lose their home to foreclosure? How can they find a suitable place to live? Aren't they going to be rejected as renters on grounds of poor credit?"" Donald Trump: This is now the time to go out and try making a deal, try buying a house. The banks are there. It's already financed. You don't really need the money because it's already financed. They are already in. They are already wet. I don't recommend renting now. I recommend now is the time to buy. Buying is much better than renting. King: Even if you've been foreclosed? Trump: Absolutely. You can make deals. So many people are being foreclosed. Millions and millions of people.

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- The estranged wife of the man accused of kidnapping then-14-year-old Elizabeth Smart from her family's Salt Lake City home in 2002 testified Friday that the defendant manipulated her into doing things by saying his orders were divine law. ""I was told that no matter how difficult I found the load to bear, I needed to follow the law or suffer eternal consequences,"" said Wanda Barzee about her husband, Brian Mitchell. Mitchell played to his wife's strong religious beliefs, telling her that divine revelations required she carry out acts that included participating in the kidnapping, she said in her second and final day of testimony in her husband's trial. ""I was told that we were commanded to take 14-year-old young women and we were to snatch them out of the world and train them up in the ministries of God,"" said Barzee. She is serving a sentence of up to 15 years after striking a plea deal last year with state and federal prosecutors for her role in the abduction and agreeing to testify for the prosecution. But the prosecution did not call her, the defense did. Mitchell used the revelations to explain his heavy drinking, his engaging in oral sex with Smart and his demand that she ""demonstrate sexual activity"" in front of Smart, said Mitchell. ""He never expressed any remorse about kidnapping Ms. Smart, did he?"" Prosecutor Francis Viti asked. ""No,"" Barzee responded. Barzee said she helped Mitchell in his meticulous preparation for Smart's abduction, from setting up the bucket that the girl was to use as her bathroom to setting up the tent in which the girl was to be raped. ""I was told that I needed to listen to the plan of my husband,"" she said. Asked if that meant she ""needed to be submissive and obey?"" Barzee responded, ""Yes."" Mitchell told her prior to the Smart abduction ""that I needed to take seven wives into my heart and home,"" Barzee said, adding that the news upset her greatly. One such attempt involved a fellow church member named Kelly who was eight months pregnant with another man's child, said Barzee, who added that she agreed to Kelly becoming another wife to Mitchell. Mitchell ultimately ended the marriage with Kelly for reasons that Barzee said were unclear. An attempt to recruit a shoe store worker named Julie to become one of Mitchell's wives failed, she said. During the winter of 2001, Mitchell revealed a new divine order, Barzee said. ""We were given the commandment to take young girls, between the ages of 10 to 14 years old."" Mitchell would go downtown to ""minister,"" which she said meant to beg, ""and stalk young girls out -- try to find out where they lived."" On June 4, 2002, the night of the abduction, she and Mitchell fought, Barzee said. ""I just knew how drastically my life was going to change,"" she said, adding that she was ""devastated"" by the prospect of taking the girl by force. Barzee, who had taken medication for mental illness prior to marrying Mitchell, said she stopped taking it when they were together at his insistence. She said her biggest fear was losing Mitchell and that she was terrified of being alone. Barzee wept when recounting having been forced by Mitchell to cook her 10-year-old daughter's pet rabbit and serve it to her. ""Brian had me tell her that it was chicken,"" said the mother of six from a previous marriage. Barzee's testimony came after her husband was escorted from the courtroom after he began singing hymns, as he has been doing throughout the trial. Mitchell faces life in prison if he is convicted of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines for sexual purposes. Barzee is being held at a federal medical center in Fort Worth, Texas, where she has been receiving mental health treatment, including medication.","Wanda Barzee says she regrets having succumbed to her husband's demands .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's health system, once the envy of many African nations, is ""in a state of collapse"" -- with many hospitals either completely shut down or unable to admit new patients, a leading doctors' group said Thursday. Doctors and nurses in Harare protest at the state of Zimbabwe's collapsing health system. The failure of medical services has forced doctors to turn away pregnant women and the sick. And with a cholera epidemic sweeping through the capital city of Harare and surrounding areas, medical officials say they fear they will be faced with hundreds of normally preventable deaths in the coming days. The four main hospitals in Harare have stopped admitting patients because of a medicine shortage, said the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights. Another hospital in the second largest city of Bulawayo -- 439 km (272 miles) from Harare -- is facing a similar shortage. ""Sick people in need of attention are being turned away,"" the group said. In many hospitals, maternity services have been scaled back -- meaning women who need to deliver babies by Caesarian section ""will needlessly die during childbirth,"" it said. The hospitals, like everything else in the country, are a victim of the country's collapsing economy under President Robert Mugabe, the group said. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwean government has asked a group headed by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan to postpone a visit meant to highlight the country's humanitarian crisis, calling it a ""partisan"" attempt to boost the opposition. Annan was set to arrive in Zimbabwe this weekend with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and rights activist Graca Machel, wife of former South African president Nelson Mandela. The trio wanted to find ways to ease the plight of Zimbabweans, nearly half of whom are in need of emergency food aid. But the state-owned daily newspaper, The Herald, says the three -- who belong to a group of senior statesmen known as the Elders -- were trying to boost the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), in power-sharing talks with Mugabe. With the political crisis showing no signs of abating, Zimbabwe's inflation rate has skyrocketed to the world's highest: 230 million percent. Independent analysts put the figure in billions. Doctors and nurses are reluctant to come to work because of the poor pay and poor equipment. Those who can are leaving Zimbabwe for neighboring countries or to Europe and Australia, the group said. The group held Mugabe's government responsible for the cholera epidemic that broke out early last month in the capital city and has since spread to other parts of the country. The government has not been able to dispose of sewage properly, nor has it been able to provide chemicals to treat water to make it potable, the group said. Residents are ""surrounded by flowing raw sewage,"" and many have been forced to resort to drink contaminated water from rivers, the group said. The pandemic, it said, ""has caused hundreds of preventable deaths."" The government has not released official figures of cholera-related death. But some private doctors say that in Harare, the number is at least 200. Earlier this week, a state-owned newspaper said 44 people had died since Friday in the southern border town of Beitbridge, about 600 km (372 miles) from Harare. The country's health ministry insists the disease has been contained. It said the lack of proper infrastructure in the impoverished nation is behind the outbreak, and that it has dispatched teams of health workers to educate the masses and provide them with water tanks. But medical activists disagree. Non-governmental aid groups are providing water and water purification tablets to the most affected communities. But they cannot reach everyone. The government should declare the cholera outbreak a national disaster and solicit international assistance, the group said. ""Definitely the government is not capable,"" said Dr. Douglas Gwatidzo, who is part of the doctors' group. "" It does not have the capacity to control the spread of cholera or to put a stop to it at the moment."" On Tuesday, doctors and nurses demonstrated against the government's failure to prevent the collapse of the health system. Baton-wielding police officers broke up the rally. Meanwhile, a unity government in Zimbabwe has yet to materialize. The main political opposition party refuses to join one unless Mugabe meets several conditions. The party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, signed a power-sharing resolution in September, but the agreement has failed to ease political tensions. The MDC accuses Mugabe of grabbing all key ministries such as home affairs, information, local government, foreign affairs and defense. It said it wants an ""equitable"" distribution. The stalemate continues. -- CNN's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report.","Main hospitals in Harare stops taking patients due to medicine shortage .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A day after a senior figure in a Gaza-based Islamist group was slain in an Israeli targeted killing, another militant organization has released a Hebrew language audio message threatening continued rocket fire into Israel. The message, addressed to ""the attacking Jews"", was posted on website used by Islamic radical groups and came from a Gaza-based organization calling itself the Jemma Ansar al-Sunna or the Community of Sunna Supporters. In Arabic accented Hebrew the speaker on the tape warned ""the killing of our brothers will not stop us from continuing the Jihad ...and our rockets will continue if you do not leave the land of Palestine."" The message referenced the killing of Islam Yassin the day before in Gaza City. Yassin and his brother were driving Wednesday afternoon when their car exploded. In a joint-statement released shortly after the explosion, Israel's air force and internal security organization, known as the Shin Bet, acknowledged carrying out the strike claiming the target was a member of a known radical group. ""Islam Yassin was a senior operative in the Army of Islam terror organization..."" the statement said. ""Most recently, Yassin had been personally involved in planning and directing a terror attack in which Israelis would be kidnapped from the Sinai Peninsula. "" The strike against the Army of Islam marks the second time this month that Israel has employed targeted killings against the group which it considers a radical Salafist organization with ideological ties to al Qaeda. On November 3, in a similar strike, another Army of Islam leader, Mohammed al-Namnam was killed by Israel. A military spokeswoman at the time called him a ""ticking bomb"" who was involved in attacks against Israeli and American targets in the Sinai Peninsula.","Group threatens to continue rocket launches into Israel .

"(CNN) -- A Sudanese rebel commander, accused of being involved in the 2007 deaths of a dozen peacekeepers in Darfur, voluntarily arrived in the Netherlands Sunday for an International Criminal Court hearing at the Hague this week, officials said. Sudanese rebel commander Bahar Idriss Abu Garda was summoned to appear before the ICC. Bahr Idriss Abu Garda, of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan, is charged with three war crimes allegedly committed on September 29, 2007, when 1000 rebel-led soldiers surrounded and stormed an African Union peacekeeping base in Haskanita, in North Darfur, the international court said. Twelve peacekeepers were killed and eight were wounded in the overnight attack, the deadliest single attack on AU peacekeepers since they began their mission in late 2004. Abu Garda, who faces charges of murder, directing attacks on peacekeepers and pillaging, was summoned to appear at the pretrial hearing at 3 p.m. Monday. The court confirmed Abu Garda voluntarily arrived at the Hague Sunday afternoon on a commercial plane, and that no arrest warrant was necessary. The court has put a gag order on Abu Garda to prevent him from speaking publicly about his case. Three other suspects, including Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, were also summoned, but remain at large. ""The voluntary appearance of Abu Garda might serve to encourage other suspects currently at large to come before the Court to be heard with all guarantees of a fair trial,"" said Silvana Arbia, registrar of the international court. The attack on the AU peacekeepers came months before the 7,000-strong force was replaced by a U.N. peacekeeping force of 26,000 troops. The U.N. force, known as UNAMID, is a joint operation between the United Nations and the African Union. It took over formally at the end of 2007. The conflict in Darfur began in 2003 after rebels in the western region of Sudan began attacking government positions. Sudan's government responded with a fierce military campaign that led to some 200,000 deaths and forced 2 million people to flee their homes, according to the United Nations.","Bahr Idriss Abu Garda faces charges in deaths of peacekeepers in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Heavy snow in northern and central China has killed 21 people since Monday, the country's Ministry of Civil Affairs said Friday, according to state-run media. Xinhua news agency said the ministry did not provide the causes of the deaths, except to note that two school canteens had collapsed in Hebei and Henan provinces since Wednesday, killing four children. The snow began to fall Monday on northern and central Chinese provinces, including Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hubei and Shaanxi, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Xinhua reported. More than 9,000 buildings have collapsed since then, Xinhua said. Citing the ministry, it said the snow has caused an estimated 4.5 billion yuan (nearly $660 million) in damages. The ministry said about 159,000 people have been evacuated from their homes or stranded vehicles, Xinhua reported. Civil Affairs Minister Li Xueju has ordered local authorities to provide food, water and clothing to those who are still stranded, ""and to make proper arrangements for people who lost their homes in the snow to get through the winter,"" Xinhua reported. It said the Civil Affairs Ministry and the Ministry of Finance have allocated 20 million yuan (about $3 million) from their central budgets to Shanxi and Hebei provinces to help move those affected by the snow and to help them build houses. Heavy snow has also fallen on Beijing, but no deaths have been reported there, Xinhua said.","The snow began to fall Monday on northern and central Chinese provinces .

"(CNN) -- As criticism of his war on organized crime mounts, Mexican President Felipe Calderon is under increasing pressure to introduce a new security policy. Calderon, who announced a crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office in 2006, has asked his country's congress to approve fresh measures to help in the fight. Police reforms are a key target of his administration. ""Our primary objective is to ensure that no matter who governs or which party he belongs, the Mexicans are protected by an honest and professional police, by an effective and transparent justice system,"" Calderon told his nation's security council when he announced the proposed reforms in June. But taking a new tack in the controversial drug war may be difficult for Calderon, as vocal politicians express their skepticism. The president's political future -- and Mexico's security -- hang in the balance. Calderon, whose term ends in 2012, has proposed a plan to eliminate more than 2,000 local police forces, combine them with state law enforcement agencies and unite them under federal control. He and his top security officials have argued that the move will better combat corruption and crime. ""This initiative is a response to the people's demand to have reliable police, and the necessity to strengthen the institutions of security in order to face the criminals that plague Mexico,"" he said earlier this year. Federal officials have said the lower salaries of local police officers make them more susceptible to corruption. More than half of them receive monthly salaries of only 4,000 pesos (about $325). Government estimates indicate that corruption has caused the dismissal of 3,000 police officers in recent years. While some lawmakers support the reform, others are critical of the current strategy, which has the Mexican military as the principal enforcers of public security. Calderon's government has dispatched about 50,000 troops to the nation's trouble spots. ""The big question for us in congress is, 'how long we will have armed forces at the forefront of the fight?'"" lawmaker Carlos Navarrete said. Calderon has said the military will not retreat in the short term, but a police overhaul would be a key step in guaranteeing security. Mexican Secretary of Public Security Genaro Garcia Luna has also proposed eliminating 2,000 local councils to strengthen security in areas with a strong presence of organized crime. But some Mexican politicians have said they are skeptical that such reforms will do much to combat corruption. Alejandro Gertz Manero of the left-wing Convergence Party has suggested the legislation would only be financially profitable for certain parties within congress and politically advantageous for certain officials, principally that of Calderon's right-wing National Action Party. ""So basically what's in this [legislation] is something that is in the interest of the local mayors, who are not from the same party as the governors,"" he said. Meanwhile, Calderon's administration has said it is dealing severe blows to organized crime, citing such examples as the seizure of an estimated $12 billion in drugs. The Mexican navy has also had high profile takedowns of drug kingpins, including the capture of American-born cartel boss Edgar Villarreal alias ""La Barbie."" But with persistent public perception about drug cartels gaining ground, Calderon has a tough battle to fight before his term ends in 2012. A top official in Mexico's opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party has said the war on drugs cannot succeed if it remains a ""fight of firepower between criminals and the state."" Mexico's government must create jobs and improve education to help fight drug trafficking, Sen. Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera said. ""We have seen 30,000 people die in the past four years,"" he said. ""And we are very close to seeing, at the end of this six-year term, an equal number of dead as in the Vietnam War."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Mario Gonzalez contributed to this report.","Felipe Calderon wants to overhaul the nation's police .

"Rio De Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazil's ruling party candidate Dilma Rousseff garnered the most votes in Sunday's presidential election but fell short of the majority she needed to avoid a runoff. With 99.98 percent of the votes counted, Rousseff led the race with 46.9 percent of the vote, according to the Superior Electoral Court. She needed 50 percent plus one vote to avoid a second-round runoff. She will now face Jose Serra, a former mayor of Sao Paulo and one of the county's most experienced politicians. He had 32.61 percent of the vote, the court said. If she ultimately prevails, Rousseff -- a former Marxist guerrilla -- would be her country's first female president. The runoff election is scheduled for October 31. ""Thank you very much to all of you, and tomorrow we will again continue the conversation that we have been having since the beginning of this electoral campaign,"" Rousseff said soon after the count, according to video on Bandeirantes television. Sunday's general election spanned across all levels of government, from local offices to the presidency. Nine candidates vied for the nation's top job. Rousseff is the hand-picked successor of President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who has an 80 percent approval rating. The outgoing president has steered Brazil into a major global economy, and his choice for the next president appears to be influencing voters. The president is barred from running for a third consecutive term. Brazil has the world's eighth-largest economy, which has grown 7 percent a year on the strength of a commodities boom and market-friendly policies. And the country will get more worldwide attention in the coming years, hosting events such as the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. Voting is mandatory in Brazil for anyone over age 18 and under age 70. Some 136 million people were eligible to vote.

"London, England (CNN) -- A Saudi prince was found guilty Tuesday of murdering an aide at a London hotel in February, in a case prosecutors said had a sexual element. Prince Saud Abdulaziz Bin Nasser Al Saud was found guilty of both murder and grievous bodily harm in the killing of Bandar Abdulaziz. Abdulaziz died after a severe beating left him with swelling and bruising of the brain and fractured ribs and neck. He also had bite marks on his face, ears and arm. The prince had not denied killing the aide, but said he had not intended to do so. He is due to be sentenced Wednesday and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. He did not take the stand in his own defense. Because the prince did not deny killing Abdulaziz, the jury's job was to determine if he was guilty of murder or manslaughter. To do that, jurors had to determine the prince's state of mind and his intent at the time he killed Abdulaziz. The jury took just over an hour and a half Tuesday to reach its verdict. The prince -- who is both a grandson and a great-nephew of Saudi King Abdullah, since his parents are cousins -- showed no reaction as the jury's unanimous verdict was read in court. Police said after the verdict that the prince had shown no remorse when he was questioned about his servant's death, instead ""concocting a story"" about how he died. ""When that was found to be a pack of lies, he tried to claim diplomatic immunity,"" but did not qualify for it, John McFarlane of London's Metropolitan Police told journalists outside the court Tuesday. Prosecutors said the prince's systematic mistreatment of the victim had a sexual element. The bitings suffered by Abdulaziz were not a factor in his death, but had ""an obvious sexual connotation,"" prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw said in his opening statement two weeks ago. The two men were in London earlier this year as Al Saud took in Morocco, the Maldives and other European cities on a long global holiday with Abdulaziz as his companion. Al Saud's lawyer, John Kelsey-Fry, said in his closing argument Monday that Al Saud ""must live with the consequences"" of having killed Abdulaziz, but he never intended to harm him. Kelsey-Fry reminded the jury that a pathologist had been unable to determine how Abdulaziz died but that only one of his injuries, by itself, could have killed him -- a compression of the neck, the barrister said, that could have been caused when Al Saud grabbed Abdulaziz briefly by the throat. An ""awful, reprehensible, culpable act,"" he said, ""but an act of murder?"" Kelsey-Fry also challenged the prosecution's assertion that the defendant and the victim had a master-servant relationship, telling the jury that the two men had ""enjoyed a genuine friendship."" He also disputed suggestions from the prosecutor and several witnesses that the prince and his aide had a gay relationship. During their visit to London, the two men shared a hotel room, went shopping together and stayed out late in bars and nightclubs. Earlier in the day, prosecutor Laidlaw presented his closing argument. He told the jury they might consider drawing an ""adverse inference"" from the prince's refusal to face questions. The case ""cries out for an explanation,"" he said, adding that the jury might care to reflect on how the prince might have answered questions about the nature of his relationship with Abdulaziz, why it was that he attacked him on more than one occasion, his account of what happened the night his aide died and why it was that he waited hours before informing anyone of his death. When he did contact authorities, Al Saud said that Abdulaziz had been assaulted by robbers three weeks earlier. He is a man, said Laidlaw, ""incapable of telling the truth."" CNN's Andrew Carey contributed to this report.","Prince shows no remorse, police say after the verdict .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghanistan is postponing its presidential elections until August 20 due to security and logistical concerns, the country's election commission said Thursday. Afghan President Hamid Karzai's five-year term is coming to an end this year. The balloting was originally scheduled for late May, but the independent election commission laid out several reasons for the delay. Security is a factor, the commission said. It also cited a lack of trained staff, incomplete voter registration and the weather. It is difficult to campaign or distribute ballots during the rough winter months in the rugged landscape. The elections are a critical moment for Afghanistan as President Hamid Karzai's five-year term ends. He was elected in December 2004 in largely peaceful polling. But since then, the Taliban militant movement has regrouped, international troop deaths have increased and there has been an increase in terror attacks, mostly in eastern and southern Afghanistan. Afghanistan has already registered 3 million voters and is holding voter drives to register more. The United States will deploy additional troops in coming months to provide much-needed security in the run-up to the election. The country expects to hold parliamentary elections in 2010. Meanwhile on Wednesday coalition forces fighting in southern Afghanistan killed four militants, the U.S. military said. Coalition soldiers were targeting a Taliban leader in the Zabul province when militants fired on them, according to a military statement. Soldiers returned fire, killing the four militants. Soldiers then searched their compound and confiscated several assault rifles. This operation comes as the U.S. military is contemplating adding three brigades to the war effort in Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday that the troop build up could happen by this summer.

"Washington (CNN) -- Airport security policies ""have to evolve"" to ensure the safety of passengers while minimizing invasive procedures such as enhanced pat downs, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday. Gibbs stopped short of signaling any imminent change in the enhanced screening, which some passengers complain amounts to legal groping. However, Gibbs made clear that the government is open to adjusting the procedures in response to public feedback and intelligence gathered on possible plots. ""This is a process that, based on intelligence and based on feedback, is and will continue to evolve and change."" Gibbs told reporters, adding the goal is to ""maximize the security and protection and minimize that invasiveness."" He noted that airport screening has evolved in recent years to include the banning of most liquids, removing shoes and other steps in response to specific threats, and added: ""The policies have to evolve."" Travelers who set off metal detectors at airport security are asked to undergo extra screening. If they refuse to go through an enhanced visual device that shows the body through clothing, they are required to submit to the thorough pat down in order to fly. Incidents such as last December's failed bombing of a U.S.-bound flight by a man with explosives in his underwear and the recent detection of explosives in air cargo packages from Yemen prompted the enhanced screening. However, the more thorough pat-down process has generated alarm and anger, with some travelers complaining they were given little warning of the procedure and that they felt violated by the touching of private parts. In interviews and statements Sunday and Monday, the head of the Transportation Security Administration said the enhanced screening was necessary for now, but the policies could be revised as time goes on. ""We welcome feedback and comments on the screening procedures from the traveling public, and we will work to make them as minimally invasive as possible while still providing the security that the American people want and deserve,"" TSA Administrator John Pistole said in a statement released Sunday. ""We are constantly evaluating and adapting our security measures, and as we have said from the beginning, we are seeking to strike the right balance between privacy and security."" Pistole also told CNN that the outcry over the new screening was overblown. ""Very few people actually receive the pat down. In spite of all the public furor about this, very few people do,"" he said. On Friday, Pistole issued a public service video announcement offering travelers guidance on what to expect from TSA security officials ahead of the holiday travel season. ""As you enter the checkpoint, you'll be directed to go through either a walk-through metal detector, or in some airports, an Advanced Imaging Technology -- AIT -- unit,"" he said in the video. ""If you are directed to pass through an AIT, you may opt out. If you choose to opt out you will receive a thorough pat down by someone of the same gender,"" he said.  ""We very much appreciate your involvement, cooperation and assistance in assuring the safety of you, the traveling public.""","White House spokesman stops short of calling for changes .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso refused to comment on Renault's upcoming hearing about alleged race-fixing at last year's Singapore Grand Prix as he chose to focus on this weekend's race in Monza. Fernando Alonso won the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix after Renault teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. crashed. The Spaniard's Renault team face a probe from world motorsport's governing body the FIA on September 21 over claims that Nelson Piquet Jnr crashed on purpose, making it easier for his teammate to win the race due to the introduction of the safety car. Piquet, who was sacked by Renault after the Hungarian Grand Prix in late July after failing to score a point this year, has reportedly already made a sworn statement about his involvement. However, two-time Formula One world champion Alonso gave little away at a press conference on Thursday ahead of the Italian Grand Prix. ""For me, it's difficult to understand this situation and these investigations,"" the 28-year-old said. ""It's another day. I'm preparing for this grand prix, trying for a good result here. I'm fully concentrated on the job. ""Of course, I'm very surprised. I can't imagine this situation, but it's time to start thinking about this race. I'm not spending any time on this. ""After the hearing on the 21st everything will be clarified, and that will be the time to say something."" Piquet was outspoken in his criticism of influential billionaire Renault boss Flavio Briatore after his departure, but Alonso believes the Brazilian still has a future in F1. ""We were teammates for a year and a half, and I never had a problem with him. He has the talent to be in Formula One,"" Alonso said. ""After a year and a half with Renault in not the most competitive car, he needs a competitive car. I'm sure he is capable of good results in the future."" The F1 future of Briatore, and his Renault team, would be in major doubt if they are found guilty by the FIA, but Alonso backed his boss. ""He is nice person, a nice boss with me,"" he said. ""He is a friend who has always supported my career from the time I was at Minardi. ""Flavio is one of the good people here, and he always has my support."" Meanwhile, Ferrari -- who have been linked with a move for Alonso in 2010 -- announced on Thursday that Banco Santander will be one of the team's title sponsors for the next five years. The Spanish banking group had sponsored Ferrari's rivals McLaren for the past three seasons, but decided not to renew the deal.","Fernando Alonso evades questions about Renault's upcoming FIA hearing .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich's hopes of retaining the German Bundesliga title suffered another blow on Saturday as Louis van Gaal's team were held 1-1 at third-placed Bayer Leverkusen. The Bavarians now trail leaders Borussia Dortmund by 14 points after 13 rounds, having missed out on the chance to move into the top-five after conceding an equalizer right on halftime. Germany striker Mario Gomez continued his hot scoring run to put Bayern ahead in the 34th minute from close range after Bastian Schweinsteiger flicked on Thomas Muller's cross. But Danijel Pranjic brought down Sidney Sam, allowing Arturo Vidal to slot in the resulting spot-kick. Van Gaal brought on France midfielder Franck Ribery in the 61st minute, but the closest Bayern came to a winner was when Gomez headed Philipp Lahm's injury-time cross over the bar. ""It was bitter to draw, because I could have scored in the last few minutes,"" Gomez, who has netted eight goals this season and five in the last four games, told AFP. ""Leverkusen were very strong in the second half, so we have to be happy with the point."" Borussia Dortmund came from behind to win 2-1 at Freiburg and maintain the club's seven-point margin at the top. Freiburg took the lead in the 26th minute with a farcical own-goal as Neven Subotic's attempted clearance hit fellow defender Mats Hummels and bounced into the net after Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller failed to hold onto a free-kick. The visitors leveled with 15 minutes to play though substitute Robert Lewandowski, whose header from Marcel Schmelzer's cross came within seconds of coming on and followed up his midweek double for Poland. Three minutes later Lewandowski's compatriot Lukasz Piszczek delivered a low cross which Mensur Mujdza turned into his own net, and Freiburg were denied a late equalizer when Julian Schuster hit the bar. Early-season pacesetters Mainz stayed second, two points ahead of Leverkusen, winning 3-2 at Borussia Monchengladbach after twice coming from behind. Marco Reus scored the opener in the 53rd minute and the 21-year-old put Gladbach back ahead on 69 after 20-year-old Andre Schurrle leveled. Substitute Sami Allagui won it for Mainz, equalizing soon after coming on in the 75th minute with a volley from Christian Fuchs' cross. Then, with two minutes left, the Tunisian striker ran onto a fine through-ball from Fuchs, lifted the ball over goalkeeper Christofer Heimeroth and headed the ball into the net. The result means Gladbach could drop to the bottom of the table if Cologne win at Stuttgart on Sunday. Hannover moved up to fourth place on 22 points with a 3-2 win at home to Hamburg, as striker Mike Hanke headed a late winner. Hannover led in the 31st minute through Lars Stindl, but Chinese midfielder Heung-Min Son leveled from close range five minutes before halftime and then headed Hamburg ahead nine minutes after the interval. Christian Schulz equalized five minutes later with a superb individual effort as the Hannover captain flicked the ball up and beat goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny with an overhead kick. Son then hit the post before Hanke popped up in the final minute to leave Hamburg in ninth place after a fifth defeat in 13 games. Hoffenheim moved above Freiburg on goal difference, claiming fifth place on 21 points with a 4-0 rout of Eintracht Frankfurt. Boris Vukcevic headed the opener in the 31st minute from Sebastian Rudy's corner, then seconds later Vedad Ibisevic had an effort cleared off the line. But the Bosnia striker killed off the game with goals in the 69th and 70th minutes, the first from Andreas Beck's cross and the second after a surging run by Peniel Mlapa. The Togo-born teenager wrapped it up in time added on as Frankfurt dropped to seventh after the home side's seven-match unbeaten run came to a crashing halt, leaving the club on 20 points and above Bayern on goal difference. Promoted Kaiserslautern moved away from the relegation zone with a 3-1 win at Nuremberg, who remained on 18 points behind Hamburg on goal difference. The visitors led 3-0 after 33 minutes with goals from midfielder Stiven Rivic -- his first for the club -- and fellow Croatian Ivo Ilicevic before their compatriot Srdjan Lakic headed his seventh of the season. Substitute Robert Mak pulled one back in the 67th minute before Lautern's Athanasios Petsos was sent off for an elbow on Andreas Wolf with 11 minutes left. Nuremberg captain Wolf hit the bar with a penalty for minutes later as his team's four-match winning run at home came to an end. Schalke climbed out of the bottom three and up to 14th on 13 points with a morale-boosting 4-0 thrashing of Werder Bremen as the teams warmed up for midweek Champions League action in starkly contrasting fortunes. Veteran Spanish striker Raul netted a hat-trick after Christoph Metzelder opened the scoring in the 23rd minute with a header that hit the bar and then rebounded into the net off the back of helpless goalkeeper Tim Wiese. Raul doubled the lead on the stroke of halftime after Wiese could only parry Edu's free-kick and then pounced on Per Mertesacker's clearance 11 minutes after the break. The 33-year-old then chipped Wiese after a defensive lapse by substitute Daniel Jensen before Bremen had Philipp Bargfrede sent off for two late bookings. The visitors slumped to a third defeat in four games, and will fall to 12th if Wolfsburg earn a point at St. Pauli on Sunday.","Champions Bayern Munich trail German leaders Borussia Dortmund by 14 points .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- North Korea has begun fueling its long-range rocket, according to a senior U.S. military official. A satellite image shows a rocket sitting on its launch pad in the northeast of the country. The fueling signals that the country could be in the final stages of what North Korea has said will be the launch of a satellite into space as early as this weekend, the senior U.S. military official said Wednesday. Other U.S. military officials said the top portion of the rocket was put on very recently, but satellite imagery shows a shroud over the stage preventing a direct view of what it looks like. The officials said the payload appears to have a ""bulbous"" cover, which could indicate that there is a satellite loaded on it. Such a cover protects a satellite from damage in flight. Although the sources did not know for sure what the payload is, they said there is no reason to doubt that it is a satellite, as indicated by North Korea. Pyongyang has said it will launch the rocket between April 4 and April 8. Pentagon officials worry less about the payload and more about the launch itself, saying that any kind of launch will give the North Koreans valuable information about improving their ballistic missile program. The United States believes that the North Koreans have the technology to hit Alaska or Hawaii with a missile and that the country is working on advancing that technology so it could hit the west coast of the United States.","Nation could be in the final stages of launch, which could come this weekend .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Children in war-ravaged Afghanistan are safer than those growing up in London or New York, NATO's top civilian envoy says. Mark Sedwill, the senior civilian representative for NATO, made the comments on an episode of CBBC's ""Newsround,"" which is airing Monday. In the show -- a BBC current-affairs program for children -- several youngsters in Kabul, Afghanistan, say they are afraid of daily violence and the frequent explosions in their war-torn country. In response, Sedwill says: ""Here in Kabul, and other big cities actually, there are very few of these bombs. The children are probably safer here than they would be in London, New York or Glasgow or many other cities. ""Most children can go about their lives in safety. It's a very family-oriented society. So it is a little bit like a city of villages,"" he added. A U.N. report released earlier this year seems to contradict Sedwill's assessment. The February report, by the special representative for children and armed conflict, says that children in Afghanistan are increasingly the victims of roadside attacks, crossfire between militants and international forces, and air strikes. In addition, they have been used as human shields and recruited as suicide bombers. The report also said boys are sexually abused and exploited by armed groups and girls schools have been burned down. Earlier this year, there was a rash of poisonings involving schoolgirls, and several instances of acid attacks have been reported. On Monday, Sedwill elaborated on what he meant in his remark. ""Any comment you have to clarify obviously wasn't very well put and the comparison I made with western cities distracted attention from the important point I was seeking to make,"" he said. ""I was trying to explain to an audience of British children how uneven violence is across Afghanistan. Half the insurgent violence takes place in 10 of the 365 districts, and, in those places, children are too often the victims of IEDs and other dangers. But, in cities like Kabul where security has improved, the total levels of violence, including criminal violence, are comparable to those which many western children would experience. ""For most Afghans, the biggest challenges are from poverty -- the absence of clean water, open sewers, malnutrition, disease -- and many more children are at risk from those problems than from the insurgency.""","NEW: Remark took away from point he was trying to make, Sedwill says .

"(CNN) -- Fantasia Barrino testified in her boyfriend's child custody case in a Charlotte, North Carolina, court Monday, according to a court spokesman. Barrino's controversial relationship with Antwaun Cook led his wife, Paula Cook, to accuse the ""American Idol"" winner of wrecking her marriage and stealing her husband. The singer testified that she knew from the first day of her relationshsip with Cook that he was married and still living with his wife, according to two sources who were in the courtroom.  The sources asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information. Her manager offered no response when contacted by CNN Monday. Barrino publicly acknowledged the relationship last summer, but she insisted then that she did not know Cook was a married man. Paula Cook alleged in a court filing that her husband and Barrino engaged in a year-long affair in which her husband enjoyed ""the lavish benefits associated with the high-profile relationship."" Barrino was treated at a Charlotte hospital for a ""sleep aid"" overdose several days after Cook's wife filed her child custody petition in Mecklenburg County District Court in August. She later said she purposefully overdosed. Barrino's raw talent as a songstress, combined with her hard-luck story as a teenage mother, won her many fans, starting with her winning ""American Idol's"" third season. Her six-year-long entertainment career has been pockmarked with adversity, including being sued by her own father and well-publicized financial troubles. She is currently touring the United States supporting her ""Back to Me"" album.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer said Andy Murray can claim multiple Grand Slam titles after the eight ATP World Tour finalists were introduced to British Prime Minister David Cameron. Ahead of the season-ending event in London, Mr Cameron invited Federer, Murray, world number one Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Roddick, David Ferrer, Tomas Berdych and Robin Soderling to a reception at Downing Street. The week-long tournament gets underway on Sunday when British number one Murray takes on Soderling in the opening match at the O2 Arena. Top eight ready for London showdown . ""It's fantastic that the ATP World Tour Finals tournament is back in London for the second year running. It's great for London and great for the country,"" Mr Cameron was quoted as saying by the ATP Tour website. ""I hope that seeing the world's top players compete right on our doorstep, including Britain's very own Andy Murray, will inspire our next generation of sporting heroes."" Murray, who has yet to win a Grand Slam title, said: ""It's the second time I've been here. It was nice. He [David Cameron] likes tennis, which we knew beforehand. We spoke about tennis and some of the past players. It was good fun, I really enjoyed it."" But on the eve of the tournament, Federer, who has 16 Grand slam titles to his name, said Murray had the potential to dominate the sport if he can clinch his first major crown. ""If Murray wins a first grand slam title, that could possibly open the floodgates,"" Federer told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph. ""And he could start dominating and winning slams, but I guess you just never know until he does it. ""It's important that you believe that you can do it, and Murray clearly has the game to do it, as otherwise he wouldn't have a winning record against me or so many titles already."" Murray will play Federer in the round robin stage and boasts a good record against his opponent, winning eight of their last 13 meetings. But Federer rejected suggestions that Murray holds a psychological edge over him. ""I never really thought about it from that perspective about having a psychological advantage,"" Federer said. ""He has very strong things on his side, and I have very strong things on my side, and that's why these days when we play each other it comes down to who has the better day. ""I don't feel as though necessarily he or I have an advantage over the other. I just think he's become a really good player.""","Eight ATP World Tour finalists meet British Prime Minister David Cameron .

"(CNN) -- Opener Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a superb century as Sri Lanka forced their way back on the second day of the first Test against India in Ahmedabad. Dilshan smashed 112 and featured in solid partnerships with fellow-opener Tharanga Paranavitana (35) and captain Kumar Sangakkara (31) as Sri Lanka completed a day of dominance. Fast bowler Zaheer Khan opened a window of opportunity for the hosts by snaring Dilshan and Sangakkara in successive overs in the final session, but Mahela Jayawardene (36 not out) and Thilan Samaraweera, five from a half-century, denied the home side further inroads as Sri Lanka ended on 275 for three, 151 in deficit. Zaheer had looked menacing with the new ball, but with little assistance from the pitch, Sri Lanka were off to a good start and Dilshan looked comfortable. Together with left-handed Paranavitana, Dilshan added 74 for the opening wicket at a brisk pace, effectively putting the pressure back on the home side. Ishant Sharma eventually severed that stand, forcing Paranavitana to fend at a delivery that moved away a touch and he edged to wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni who held an excellent catch in front of first slip. Save for that burst from Zaheer with the new ball, India's attack had looked ordinary and it allowed Sangakkara to hit his stride. With the Sri Lankan skipper holding up one end, Dilshan continued to play freely and eventually reached his 10th Test hundred -- his fifth this year -- by cutting leg-spinner Ishant for a boundary. The two had added 115 for the second wicket when Zaheer produced another fine burst to snare both batsmen. Dilshan was tempted with a short ball, but mistimed his pull and ended up presenting Rahul Dravid a simple catch at gully. Sangakkara was also done by a short ball, the captain top edging to Sachin Tendulkar at fine leg. The twin dismissal left Sri Lanka at 194 for three, but Mahela and Samaraweera put the visitors' pursuit back on track. Both batsmen began cautiously until Samaraweera, who has already scored 1083 runs in eight Tests in this calendar year, shed the shackles by driving Mishra for consecutive boundaries. The fourth-wicket pair have so far added 81 in an unbroken stand. In the morning, master spinner Muttiah Muralitharan finished with three wickets as the hosts were bowled out in the first session. Muralitharan, who had snared Yuvraj on Monday, added the wickets of tailenders Harbhajan Singh and Ishant to his tally, while fast bowler Chanaka Welegedara removed Dravid, the batsman falling without adding to his overnight score of 177. Dravid fell in the third over of the morning, Welegedara collecting his fourth wicket by bowling the batsman via an inside edge as he attempted to drive. Harbhajan, two overnight, then added 25 for the eighth wicket with Zaheer taking India's total past the 400-run mark in the process. But Sri Lanka's spinners made short work of the tail. Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath trapped Zaheer in front, while Muralitharan claimed the wickets of Harbhajan and last man Ishant to finish with a three-wicket haul.","Opener Tillakaratne Dilshan scores a superb century for Sri Lanka against India .

"(CNN) -- Charlie Sheen has filed a lawsuit against adult film actress Capri Anderson, claiming she tried to extort money from him following an October incident at New York's Plaza Hotel, a representative for the actor told CNN Monday. The lawsuit, filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, states that Anderson ""fabricated a sensational tale about being assaulted, battered and held against her will, and used that fictional story as a basis for an extortion plot against Sheen."" Anderson,  whose real name is Christina Walsh, appeared with her attorney  on  ABC's ""Good Morning America"" Monday to speak out about an alleged  violent  encounter she had with Sheen at the hotel. In  the interview, Anderson said Sheen sent her an apology through  a text message, and ""offered money for her silence."" ""Charlie  Sheen has never offered her a dime to keep her quiet,"" Sheen's  attorney, Yale Galanter said later Monday on CNN's ""The Joy Behar Show."" Anderson's  attorney, Keith Davidson told CNN Monday evening that a civil suit  would be filed ""very soon"" and that a  complaint against Sheen had been  filed Monday with the New York Police  Department. However, a police  representative said no complaint had been  received as of 5:10 p.m. According to Sheen's complaint, Anderson's lawyers contacted Sheen's lawyers on October 28 to inform them that the actress would go to the authorities and appear on morning talk shows ""unless Sheen paid her a seven-figure sum."" ""There  was definitely never an offer for money to silence her or anything else,  as a matter of fact, when her lawyers approached us, we told them to go  pound salt because we knew that Mr. Sheen had done absolutely nothing  wrong,"" Galanter said during ""The Joy Behar Show."" Galanter said  Anderson did not make allegations of wrongful conduct against Sheen on  the night of the incident and that she posted on her website ""that she  was 'fine' and if you wanted to see  more of her, for a price, one could  enter the website."" Davidson defended his client's  right to receive compensation ""for the damage to her body, to her  emotional state, and to her purse,"" but wouldn't go into details about  whether there had been any talk of a financial settlement. ""We  know that the room was trashed, we know that Capri was chased and  locked into a bathroom,"" said Davidson, ""and we know that one person was  brought away from the hotel against their will."" ABC  questioned Anderson about why she called a girlfriend while locked in a  bathroom instead of calling the police. She answered that she was in  shock, ""I never expected the night to unfold the way it did,"" said  Anderson.  It is still unclear who called police to the hotel that  night. ""We're going to defend these charges vigorously and she will never get a check from Charlie Sheen,"" Galanter said. Anderson said she was offered $3,500 to appear at a dinner party with the actor. She said Sheen was drinking heavily and ""grew more intense.""  She said the actor ""put his hands around her neck."" She also  accused Sheen of ""snorting a white, powdery substance."" Galanter denied the allegations. ""He was searched, she was searched, the room was searched by the New York Police Department, it's a total fabrication,"" Galanter said. ""There was no cocaine, there was no white, powdery substance, she never saw him doing anything illegal."" Sheen spent several hours in a New York hospital in October after police responded to an early morning call about ""an emotionally disturbed person"" at The Plaza Hotel, a law enforcement source said. Sheen's representative blamed an ""adverse allergic reaction"" to a medication for the hospitalization.

"New York (CNN) -- Jenn Sterger, the woman to whom pro football quarterback Brett Favre allegedly sent sexually explicit text messages and pictures, has hired a law firm to represent her, as the National Football League carries out its investigation into the allegations, her manager and the lawyer told CNN Wednesday. ""After much deliberation, LaRusso & Conway has been retained to represent Jenn Sterger and to advise her throughout the process,"" said Phil Reese, Sterger's manager and CEO of the firm Player Relations/Public Relations. ""Joseph Conway will serve as lead counsel in this matter."" Reese said the Long Island-based firm was retained Tuesday. Conway confirmed the arrangement. The NFL initiated an investigation into Favre's actions after the sports website Deadspin.com reported in August that the athlete sent voice messages, texts and pictures of his penis to Sterger in 2008, when he was the Jets' quarterback and she was working for the team as a sideline personality and host. Deadspin reported Wednesday that Milton E. Ahlerich, a vice president in the league's security department, asked Deadspin Editor A.J. Daulerio -- who wrote the Favre stories -- to meet ""to determine the possibility of you sharing any and all details you and your media organization may have on this matter."" Daulerio said in a website posting that he told Ahlerich he would ""be willing to cooperate with the NFL's thorough investigation into Brett Favre's sexting habits,"" but would not divulge his source for the original story. ""I told Mr. Ahlerich that any and all information we have to offer is available on the site and that I'm unwilling to give anything more than that right now. To this, he responded that he's read over what has been on the site many, many times, meaning this poor man ... has been looking at penis pictures for close to a week. Pity him."" Daulerio said Ahlerich also told him he met Tuesday with Favre and that the meeting was ""even-handed"" and that the parties involved were ""well-represented."" Daulerio has acknowledged that third-party sources were paid for the story about Sterger and that he could not say definitively that the messages or photos the site posted came from the 41-year-old quarterback. Ahlerich did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday. Favre has not publicly addressed the investigation. Asked Wednesday why he had not denied the stories, he told a reporter, ""That's something that's within the league and I just have to leave it at that."" Sterger, 26, is co-host of ""The Daily Line,"" a sports program on Versus, a sports cable television channel. The Jets have given National Football League officials all the information they have regarding the incident, a team spokesman said last week. Jesse Derris, a spokesman for the Jets, told HLN's ""Prime News"" that the team has no role in the allegations against Favre, who played one season in New York and now plays for the Minnesota Vikings. Favre, who has been married for 14 years, signed with the Minnesota Vikings in August 2009 after emerging from retirement for the second time in as many years. Deadspin has also reported that a second woman has come forward to allege that she received other lewd messages from the quarterback and that a third woman, whom the site did not identify, also received similar messages. The site reported the two women were massage therapists hired by the Jets, and identified them only by pseudonyms. Derris said the therapists were hired for two days in the team's 2008 training camp and would not confirm whether they had any direct contact with Favre. CNN could not independently confirm whether the voice in the recordings belongs to Favre, or whether he sent the notes. Favre played most of his career with the Green Bay Packers, leading the team to a Super Bowl title in 1997. He was traded to the Jets after the 2007 season.","Jenn Sterger allegedly received lewd messages from NFL star Brett Favre .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva, agreed on something Monday: how to dress for battle. The actor and the mother of his 1-year-old daughter, Lucia, both wore dark sunglasses, black business suits and emotionless expressions as they walked into a Los Angeles courtroom for a child custody hearing. Since reporters were dismissed soon after Judge Scott Gordon called their case, it is unknown if the former couple agreed on anything else. It would be unexpected, judging from their split earlier this year. Grigorieva was on the stand Monday morning, while her mother and the woman who works for Gibson as the baby's nanny were waiting to testify in the afternoon session. Gibson and Grigorieva last met in the same courtroom on November 10 for a daylong hearing that included squabbles over attorneys' fees, child support and whether they should be allowed to talk freely to the media about the family law case. Gordon stopped sort of imposing a gag order, but Gibson's lawyers have followed a self-imposed silence, citing routine confidentiality requirements in a family law case. Grigorieva, a Russian musician, decided to talk publicly -- to CNN's Larry King -- about her claims of domestic violence by Gibson. The public has already heard several recordings of angry Gibson phone calls to Grigorieva, but she told King she did not give them to celebrity news website Radaronline. Details about the case have flowed at a steady pace on celebrity news website TMZ over the past two weeks. Hundreds of pages of sealed court documents were somehow leaked, including affidavits, deposition transcripts and dental records. Even beyond the family law case, two related criminal investigations are under way. The Los Angeles County district attorney is considering evidence gathered by sheriff's investigators to decide if a domestic violence case will be made against Gibson, according to a spokeswoman for the prosecutor. Detectives are also investigating Gibson's charge that Grigorieva tried to extort him with phone recordings she made of his calls, a sheriff's spokesman said.","NEW: Mel's nanny and Grigorieva's mom are waiting to testify .

"(CNN) -- Egypt began the defense of their Africa Cup of Nations crown with an emphatic 3-1 victory against title rivals Nigeria in Angola on Tuesday. The Pharaohs, who have won the tournament a record six times, had to come from behind after conceding a 12th-minute goal in the Group C opener in Benguela. Nigeria, seeking a third title, took the lead when striker Chinedu Obasi, who plays for German club Hoffenheim, cut in from the right and lashed in a fierce left-foot effort that goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary could only tip into the net. Obasi's strike partner Aiyegbeni Yakubu thought he had earned a penalty when his cross hit the arm of Egypt defender Mahmoud Fathalla, but referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn ruled it was not intentional. Egypt leveled in the 34th minute when Emad Moteab ran onto Ahmed Hassan's throughball, rounded Vincent Enyeama as the goalkeeper rushed out of his area, and slotted the ball into the empty net. Captain Hassan put his side ahead nine minutes after halftime, with his shot wrong-footing Enyeama after taking a massive deflection off the backside of Taye Taiwo following a layoff from Mohamed Zidan. Nigeria coach Shaibu Amodu surprisingly took off Chelsea midfielder Jon Obi Mikel with 10 minutes to play and replaced him with veteran Portsmouth striker Kanu. But the move backfired as Egypt substitute Mohamed Gedo drove in a low right-foot shot on 88 to seal his side's first victory over the Super Eagles in 23 years. In Tuesday's other Group C match, Mozambique came from two goals down to deny Benin a historic first victory at the tournament. The Squirrels did earn their first point, but were expecting much more after scoring twice before halfway through the opening period. Striker Razak Omotoyossi, who plays for French club Metz, netted the opener from the penalty spot in the 14th minute after being brought down by Mozambique goalkeeper Joao Rafael. Dario Khan then put through his own net seven minutes later as he stabbed the ball past Rafael while trying to clear a loose ball, but Almiro Lobo pulled a goal back after half an hour when he headed home as Benin defended woefully at a corner. Substitute Goncalves Fumo leveled the score 10 minutes after halftime as goalkeeper Yoann Djidonou, who had flapped ineffectually to allow Lobo to score, was caught out after coming out of his area to clear the ball. With the multi-ball system in operation, Mozambique took a quick throw-in and Elias Pelembe set up Fumo with Djidonou scrambling in vain back to his goal.","Egypt begin defense of their Africa Cup of Nations crown with a 3-1 victory over Nigeria .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Jim Leyritz is seven years removed from pro baseball, 11 years from his last World Series home run. But he's itching to get back on the field. Three years ago this December, after having a few drinks with friends on his 44th birthday, the car he was driving hit that of 30-year-old Freida Veitch. She died as a result, and Leyritz soon found himself staring down the prospect of up to 15 years in prison after being charged with vehicular manslaughter while driving drunk. On Saturday, a South Florida jury decided his fate: not guilty of vehicular manslaughter, though guilty of a lesser drunken-driving charge. A bailiff unlocked his handcuffs, and an emotional Leyritz hugged his mother and girlfriend. He hugged three of the jurors as well, showing them pictures of the three boys of whom he had primary custody. And soon thereafter, he heard from his boys' baseball program -- which had barred the former New York Yankee from being on the bench during practices and games alongside his sons. ""They ... said, 'OK, springtime, we want you back out here coaching,' "" he said Sunday from a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, youth baseball complex he said he often goes to several times a week with his kids. ""It's one of the things I miss the most."" After his retirement, Leyritz traded off his athletic celebrity, giving motivational speeches tied to his postseason heroics as well as doing radio and TV work. On the morning of December 28, 2007, after the crash, he said he was wearing a large World Series ring when he told law enforcement officers, ""I'm Jim Leyritz, the baseball player."" Before he was charged criminally, Leyritz settled a civil lawsuit filed by Veitch's family, saying he did so out ""of the goodness of my heart"" to help out the victim's two children. Still, he said he feels his high profile worked against him -- and contributed to the vehicular manslaughter charge -- because ""people wanted to get their 15 minutes [of fame]."" Well before the trial started this month, Leyritz said he had to breathe into a breathalyzer regularly -- to assure that he hadn't been drinking -- at home for three months, temporarily lost his license, then had to breathe into a car breathalyzer every time he got behind the wheel. He went through ""DUI school"" as well as nine weeks of counseling, he said. Because of his legal troubles, Leyritz said he lost his jobs in the media as well as speaking engagements. It could have been worse, said Leyritz, had Major League Baseball not stepped up and helped him pay his bills. All the while, the former player said he threw himself into the criminal case, regularly returning to the accident scene, poring over testimony, talking with his lawyer. Still, Leyritz said he felt helpless as he awaited the verdict of the jury that had, the day earlier, told the judge it was deadlocked. ""I used to be a catcher, controlling the entire game, Before I put my hand down, the game didn't start,"" he said. ""This was totally different. This was totally something over which you have no control."" Prosecutors claimed that Leyritz was legally drunk when he sped through a red light and hit Veitch; the defense countered that Veitch didn't have her lights on and that the light was yellow when Leyritz drove through. A defense expert, Dr. Stefan Rose, testified that Leyritz told him he had seven drinks shortly before the crash, a number that the defendant said wasn't right but ""a number we had to use."" Jury foreman Brian Haul told CNN's sister network TruTV that, while all six people quickly agreed Leyritz wasn't guilty of the greater charge, they felt compelled to hold him responsible on some grounds. ""Are we going to go in front the public and say it's OK to have four or five drinks within an hour or so period of time and then hit the road? I think that was the deciding factor,"" he said. Yet one juror, Sharon Wessinger, said she had also wanted to acquit Leyritz of the lesser drunken driving charge. She told Leyritz, who came over to show the jurors' pictures of his three boys after the verdict, that she changed her mind to avoid a hung jury that may have led to another trial. ""The thought of it going into another trial later and you possibly being convicted of manslaughter, when we weren't doing that, I couldn't let that happen,"" Wessinger told Leyritz. Jurors said they didn't believe the defense's argument that the crash occurred 10 minutes earlier than investigators had said. But they also said that they didn't believe Leyritz ran the red light, and said that Veitch's drinking -- her blood-alcohol level was 0.18, more than twice the legal limit -- and the fact she wasn't wearing a seat belt were critical factors in her death. The victim's husband, Jordan Veitch, left the courtroom with his parents, saying only that Leyritz ""didn't get what he deserved."" Leyritz's legal travails aren't over; prosecution and defense attorneys will meet December 1, to settle on a sentencing date on the drunken driving charge. But the most jail time he could face is six months, far short of what could have awaited him. And for now, Leyritz is free on bond and required to breath into a device every time he gets behind the wheel. Speaking Sunday, the day after the verdict, Leyritz said he has some bitterness: toward the prosecutor, over the fact he had not been able to see his brother before he died of ALS, and because his children had to go through the whole ordeal. Since it's an anniversary of the crash, he said every birthday will remind him of Veitch ""and I'll say my prayers and condolences."" Still, Leyritz said that the entire thing will be worth it, if his and Veitch's story might convince someone not to drive after a few drinks. And he said that it's also strengthened his faith, and made him all the more grateful to be free and with family. ""The difference is, you come home and your little 9-year-old boy comes up to you and says, 'Daddy, it's over,'"" he said of his relief after the verdict. ""I was fighting for these three boys, who needed their father."" In Session's Grace Wong contributed to this report.","Jim Leyritz describes his experience after tried for DUI manslaughter .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A young boy fell to his death from a luxury suite at Los Angeles' Staples Center on Sunday night, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The 2-year-old boy fell from the suite around 9:15 p.m. (12:15 a.m. ET), police said in a statement. The boy was transported to the USC Medical Center, where he later died, Sgt. Frank Alvelais told CNN. The toddler  fell a few minutes after the conclusion of a NBA game between the Los Angles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. After the game, the boy's family and others in his group were taking pictures while still in the luxury suite section of the arena, police said. The third deck of the Staples Center -- where the luxury suite is located -- has a roughly 50-foot drop, according to KTLA. The boy was identified by Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter as Lucas Anthony Tang. An autopsy is pending, Winter said. Witness said the child was still moving his legs and arms as he was being put on a stretcher, KTLA reported.

"(CNN) -- India's hosting of the 2010 Commonwealth Games ended on a high note on Thursday as badminton player Saina Nehwal won a dramatic final gold of the 11-day competition to put her country second in the overall medal table. India had earlier suffered a humiliating defeat in one of its most popular sports when Australia registered a resounding 8-0 victory in the men's hockey final for a leading 74th gold medal and 177 in total. But Nehwal came back from the brink of defeat to secure India's 38th victory, edging England into third place, as she won the women's singles event. She became the first Indian to claim a Commonwealth gold in the sport, surviving a match-point in the second set before going on to beat Malaysian second seed 19-21 23-21 21-13 Wong Mew Choo. It was a much-needed boost for India, which had to deal with controversies about child labor, questions as to whether the venues in New Delhi would be ready in time, technology faults, disputed qualifications in athletics events and three positive drug tests -- one of whom was a home competitor, female walker Rani Yadav. With the sporting events concluded, the chairman of the New Delhi Organizing Committee, Suresh Kalmadi, applauded his country's efforts during the handing-over ceremony to the 2014 host city, Glasgow of Scotland. ""For the athletes it has been a life-changing experience. For India it has been a new beginning in sports,"" he told the crowd at a packed Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium after being greeted with boos. ""For the world it has been evidence of what India can do on the sporting stage. This is a new era for Indian sport. All this has made what has turned out to be the largest, the most-watched and the most enjoyable Games ever."" Australia, the host four years ago in Melbourne, was the dominant country throughout the competition -- which is contested by nations from the former British Empire, but was hit this year by the absence of many top athletes such as sprint star Usain Bolt of Jamaica. The Australian men's field hockey team has now won gold every time since the sport was first included, in Kuala Lumpur in 1998, and had little problems in brushing aside India on Thursday. Luke Doerner and Jason Wilon scored two goals each as their team followed up their World Cup triumph at the same Major Dhyan Chand stadium in March to seal a hat-trick of titles in 2010 along with the Champions Trophy. New Zealand won the bronze medal with a surprise victory over fourth seeds England, winning 5-3 in a penalty shootout after the match was tied 3-3 after extra-time. However, Australia's world netball champions were unable to add Commonwealth Gold to their CV as longtime rivals New Zealand retained their title with a 66-64 victory in a rematch of the 2006 final. Kenya edged out Australia as the top nation in the track and field events, winning both the marathon races on Thursday. John Kelai ended the African country's 20-year wait to win the men's title as he triumphed in a time of two hours 14 minutes and 35 seconds from Michael Shelley and compatriot Amos Matui. Irene Kosgei gave Kenya a historic first success in the women's event, edging past teammate Irene Mogake late in the race to win in a time of 2:34.32, with Australia's Lisa Weightman claiming bronze. Singapore dominated the closing table tennis events, continuing a gold rush that saw their players give up just one gold -- to India in the men's doubles on Wednesday. Yang Zi beat compatriot Gao Ning 4-1 in the men's singles final, while in another all-Singapore affair second seeds Li Jiawei and Sun Beibei upset the favored Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu 3-2 in the women's doubles. But Singapore suffered defeat in the badminton arena, with top-seeded Shinta Sari and Yao Lei losing to India's second-ranked Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Michimanda in straight sets. Malaysian top seeds Koo Kien Keat and Tan Boon Heong won the men's doubles, beating England's second seeds Nathan Robertson and Anthony Clark 21-19 21-14. Robertson also had to settle for silver in the mixed doubles, despite being the top seeds, as he and Jenny Wallwork lost 22-20 21-12 by Koo Kien Keat and Chin Ee Hui, also of Malaysia.","Commonwealth Games come to a close with host India winning the final gold medal .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actor Michael Douglas sat among a thousand other friends, family and clients of slain Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen as tears were shed and laughs shared at her funeral Sunday. Chasen, 64, died from gunshots fired into her Mercedes-Benz as she turned off Sunset Boulevard on her way home from a star-studded premiere celebration for the movie ""Burlesque"" last Tuesday morning. Her mysterious murder in a posh Beverly Hills neighborhood not only stunned her friends, but it sent fear through the exclusive community. Chasen was master at creating Oscar buzz . Beverly Hills Police Chief David Snowden asked journalists Friday to keep ""erroneous information, theories or speculation"" out of their stories about the killing. The chief assured residents it was ""a rare, isolated incident and that the Beverly Hills community remains one of the safest in the nation."" There is no prevailing theory on whether the attack was road rage or a planned hit, a police official said. No motive or suspects have been identified, he said. The chapel at Culver City, California's Hillside Memorial Park was packed Sunday with the actors, composers, producers, publicists and journalists the public relations veteran worked with for the last three decades. Douglas, who suffers from throat cancer, did not speak at the funeral for his former publicist. Lili Fini Zanuck, a film producer and friend, told mourners that Chasen's death brought the Los Angeles entertainment industry to ""a standstill."" Reporters were kept at the cemetery gate, but publicist Stephen Jaffe described the service to CNN as ""very moving"" and full of ""a whole lot of love and respect"" for Chasen. Speakers, including Chasen's brother, television producer-writer Larry Cohen, brought laughter as they shared stories about her life. Composer Hans Zimmer, who was a longtime Chasen client, also spoke at the funeral.","Chasen's death brought the entertainment industry to a standstill, a producer says .

"(CNN) -- Serious crowd trouble has led to Tuesday's soccer match between Italy and Serbia in Genoa being abandoned after just six minutes. Disturbances in the area of the Marassi stadium where visiting Serbian fans were congregated meant the kick-off had to be delayed by more than 30 minutes. And, when play began, referee Craig Thomson stopped the match after flares were thrown from the same end as the earlier disturbances, with one appearing to strike Italian goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano. Following consultations between European football's governing body UEFA, Italian and Serbian officials, the players left the pitch, without returning. Italy coach Cesare Prandelli told reporters: ""We're not playing this game. I have never seen anything like this before."" Before kick-off,  three Serb fans climbed onto a security screen and initially refused to get down, while police, firefighters and stewards surrounded the visiting fans as flares and objects were hurled at the Italian fans. The match was a Group C qualifier for the Euro 2012 championships. In the other Group C matches, Slovenia claimed a vital 1-0 win in Estonia to move up to second place in the table, level with Italy who still lead the way on goal difference. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland, who held Italy to a 0-0 draw in Belfast on Friday, needed a late Kyle Lafferty goal to scrape a 1-1 draw in the Faroe Islands. Elsewhere, world and European champions Spain were given a fright by Scotland in Glasgow, eventually securing a thrilling 3-2 Group I victory. A David Villa penalty and an Andres Iniesta goal looked to have given Spain the three points but Steven Naismith and a Gerard Pique own goal gave the Scots hope. However, substitute Fernando Llorente headed home the winner for the visitors with 11 minutes remaining. Spain are three points clear of the Czech Republic, who lie second in the table after a 2-0 win at bottom-of-the-table Liechtenstein. Germany continued their 100 per cent record in Group A with a comfortable 3-0 win at Kazakhstan, who are still pointless after their four matches. After a goalless first half, Joachim Loew's side made their class tell after the break courtesy of goals from Miroslav Klose, Mario Gomez and Lukas Podolski. Austria are now second in the table on seven points following a remarkable 4-4 draw with Belgium in Brussels. The visitors led 3-2 with three minutes left but Belgium scored two quick-fire goals before an injury time Martin Harnik goal secured the point for Austria. Turkey are a further point behind in third after suffering a shock 1-0 defeat in Azerbaijan, who collected their first victory. Russia lead the way in Group B after an eight-minute Aleksandr Kerzhakov goal gave them a vital win in Macedonia. They lie on nine points, two ahead of Ireland, Armenia and Slovakia who are locked in a three-way tie for second place. Slovakia and Ireland drew 1-1 in Zilina, while Armenia crushed bottom side Andorra 4-0 in Yerevan. France head Group D with nine points from their four games after struggling to a 2-0 win over minnows Luxembourg in Metz. Karim Benzema and Yoann Gourcuff netted for Laurent Blanc's side, who lead unbeaten Belarus -- 2-0 victors over Albania in Minsk --by a point. World Cup runners-up Netherlands continue to impress in qualifying and they maintained their 100 per cent Group E record with a stunning 4-1 victory over Sweden in Amsterdam. Klass-Jan Huntelaar and Ibrahim Afellay both scored twice as the Dutch remained three points clear of second-placed Hungary, who needed a goal four minutes into injury time from Balazs Dzsudzsak to claim a 2-1 success in Finland. The remaining group game saw Moldova win 2-0 in San Marino, who remain bottom of the group without a point. Group F remains the tightest of the nine groups with three nations still unbeaten after four rounds of matches. Greece lead the way with eight points after a 2-1 home win over Israel, while Georiga remain third on six points after conceding a late equalizer in a 1-1 draw in Latvia. In Group G, England failed to score for the first time in their revamped Wembley home after being held to a 0-0 draw by table-toppers Montenegro. Both nations remain unbeaten and look to have the group between them. The other match saw Switzerland thrash Wales 4-1 in Basel, with the Welsh bottom of the table without a point from their three matches. Portugal are up to second place in Group H after a 3-1 victory in Iceland, who remain bottom of the table without a point. They trail leaders Norway, who did not play, by two points while Denmark are third after defeating Cyprus 2-0.","Euro 2012 Group C qualifier between Italy and Serbia abandoned after just six minutes .

"(CNN) -- One lucky ticket picked up the United Kingdom's biggest ever lottery prize of just over £113 million ($180 million) on Friday night.

"Washington (CNN) -- After more than three days of deliberations, jurors on Monday convicted Ingmar Guandique of two counts of first-degree murder in the 2001 death of Washington intern Chandra Levy. As the verdict was read, Levy's mother, Susan, stared intently at Guandique. Several jurors wiped their eyes afterward. Levy, a 24-year-old California native, was in Washington working as an intern for the Bureau of Prisons when she was last seen on May 1, 2001. Her skull was found over a year later, on May 22, 2002, in Washington's Rock Creek Park. But police didn't arrest Guandique until February 2009. He was then serving a 10-year sentence for attacking two other women in the park and had reportedly spoken about killing Levy. ""It's been nearly 10 years since the promise of a young life was lost in Rock Creek Park,"" Ronald Machen, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, told reporters Monday afternoon. ""Today's verdict does send a message for a murderer to be held accountable. It's never too late for justice to be served."" Following an 11-day trial, jurors deliberated for three days and then for another two hours Monday. They notified Superior Court Judge Gerald Fisher about 11:45 a.m. that they had reached a verdict, entering the courtroom at 12:35 p.m. ET. Speaking after their dismissal, jurors told reporters they took the time to examine each piece of evidence and consider it. ""We were very careful to evaluate all the evidence, and it was a decision based on everything we had,"" said juror Susan Kelly, a journalist. Guandique, 29, will face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole when he is sentenced February 11. The jury convicted him of one count of murder with kidnapping and a second count of murder with attempted robbery. After the verdict, Susan Levy asked reporters, ""What difference does it make,"" and then answered her own question. ""You, the prosecutors, defense, the jury, the police, the public and individual citizens, as well as the media, both the written media and the visual media, we all make a difference,"" she said. ""... It makes a difference to find the right person who is responsible for my daughter's death or for anybody else's death."" Regardless of the sentence Guandique is given, ""I have a lifetime sentence of a lost limb missing from our family tree,"" she said. ""It's painful. I live with it every day. ... There's always going to be a feeling of sadness."" Emily Grinstead told reporters that she and fellow jurors were mindful not to rush a decision. While confident they reached the right verdict, she said that ""doesn't mean that I don't wish we didn't have to be here today."" ""You're dealing with somebody's life,"" Grinstead said. ""Two people's lives. I don't take that lightly."" Asked what she would say to Susan Levy, juror Linda Norton said, ""I think she has to take from this what she will. We cannot bring back her daughter. ... We did the best we could with the evidence we were given."" Prosecutors argued that Guandique, a reputed member of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha, attacked Levy while she was jogging in Washington's Rock Creek Park. After her skull was found, a  search turned up other remains of Levy's, as well as clothing later identified as hers strewn down the side of a ravine. Her running shoes were unlaced, and her clothes were turned inside out. Her pants were knotted in tight restraints around her legs. Prosecutor Amanda Haines, during her closing argument, cited what she portrayed as confessions that Guandique allegedly made to a cellmate as he served time for other attacks, as well as remarks he allegedly made to a female pen pal. Defense attorney Santha Sonenberg emphasized the largely circumstantial nature of the case, including what prosecutors have acknowledged was a lack of DNA evidence, a lack of witnesses and only secondhand accounts of Guandique's alleged confessions. Both the women who Guandique also attacked in the park -- including one on the same day Levy went missing -- spoke at the trial, testimony that Kelly called ""powerful."" He had pleaded guilty for his role in those attacks, and was set to be released in September 2010. The disappearance of Levy drew national attention after her parents discovered a connection with Gary Condit, who was then a sitting congressman from California. Condit was never a suspect in the case, but he was questioned intensively for details about Levy's whereabouts. He testified in the trial earlier this month, but refused to address a question about whether he had sex with Levy. An FBI forensic expert later confirmed Condit's semen had been found in underwear retrieved from Levy's apartment in the days after her parents reported her missing. ""We've lost our feeling for common decency. I didn't commit any crime. I didn't do anything wrong,"" he said. Condit said several times during his testimony that the media frenzy surrounding Levy's disappearance was hard to handle, including a helicopter flight over his California home while his daughter and her friends were sunbathing at the family's pool. ""They reported that I had young women in bikinis at my house,"" he said. Juror Grinstead pointed out that it wasn't just police that were sidetracked and focused for weeks on the wrong person. Asked who also was on the wrong track, she told reporters, ""You all."" Metropolitan Police Department Chief Cathy Lanier defended authorities' handling of the case Monday afternoon, saying it sometimes takes time to find evidence and suspects. The U.S. attorney's office in the District of Columbia recently opened a ""cold case"" unit, which Machen credited for leading to four convictions in the past year for murders that dated back as far as 20 years. ""It's not like it is on TV. Cases can be very complicated,"" said Lanier, who became chief in 2007. ""You never give up, regardless of criticism, regardless of mistakes. And I think that's what happened in this case."" CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. attorney says verdict shows murderers will be held accountable .

"(CNN) -- Two decades after pummeling Nintendo Entertainment System owners into submission with classic boxing title ""Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!,"" former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson is returning to the video game ring. A new Tyson boxing game for the iPhone is coming to Apple's App Store next month from Rock Software, and veteran players will note it bears more than a passing resemblance to the helium-voiced bruiser's original interactive debut. The new arcade sports simulation stars a fictional scrapper named ""Little Sammy,"" who must battle his way past 10 fighters to earn a shot at socking it to Tyson himself. Rock Software CEO John Shahidi recently told Mashable.com that he used his own high school buddies as inspiration for these fighters. ""Tyler is a friend who was a bully,"" he said. ""Luke is another friend who was the first of my friends to have kids; Franco [Italian boxer] is my best friend and lawyer."" Additional sports celebrities you can box with will also be available for purchase from Rock Software, which creates custom apps for such personalities as NBA star Carmelo Anthony, Bengals wide receiver Chad Ochocinco and his new teammate Terrell Owens. Some may find the as-yet-untitled game, which will cost 99 cents, a welcome waltz down memory lane. Others might simply view it as a clever novelty. We can't help but wonder whether it underscores the app store's brilliance or a fundamental tragic flaw. Fans of the 1987 original may appreciate the ability to quickly recreate similar thrills anytime, anywhere on a portable device. Some might even view the inclusion of Shahidi's friends as one man's realization of a childhood dream. But game developers aren't as likely to be pleased by the principle it illustrates. Today anyone can quickly and cheaply clone popular game titles on mobile handsets. These digital diversions can also be made much more convenient to access and less expensive to buy than official updates and remakes -- for example the recent ""Punch-Out!!"" for Wii. The knock-offs aren't always as polished or enjoyable as proper updates. These quickie games also help drive prices down in a field where margins are already razor-thin, making it harder for actual license-holders to compete and invest in higher-quality game experiences. Worse, such ""homages"" only add to the confusing glut of titles already available on the iPhone and iPad, which are currently home to over 40,000 game titles. No matter how good or innovative an original game may be, it's difficult for fans to discover it amid suffocating competition. This offers less incentive for game creators to raise the bar. Rock Software's game will naturally benefit from Tyson's celebrity in addition to its bargain-bin price and nostalgic boxing action. But will the game really add to the boxer's legacy? Or is it simply a novelty act designed to cash in on Tyson's recent resurgence in fame? Only time will tell. In fairness, we admit to being intrigued at the prospect of lacing up the old virtual gloves again and delivering flying uppercuts to the face of a certain ear-biting pugilist.","Mike Tyson boxing iPhone game will be availabe next month for 99 cents from Rock Software .

"Windsor, England (CNN) -- The choice of Westminster Abbey as location for the most eagerly awaited royal wedding in 30 years has taken most royal experts by surprise; their consensus of opinion over the past week suggested that St. Paul's would oversee the marriage of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. But on reflection, the abbey is the most obvious and perfect venue. By choosing it, William is showing an astute awareness of his royal status and ultimate destiny as king of England. As a modern royal couple in a modern royal family, William and Kate will start their married life in the most ancient of royal buildings, stepping into the future with one foot firmly in the past and an obliging nod to those kings and queens buried there. Designed and built as a life's work by Edward the Confessor, Westminster Abbey was consecrated in 1065. Edward was too ill to attend the abbey's opening ceremony and rounded off a particularly miserable Christmas by dying a few days later on January 5 in the fateful year of 1066, the year of the Norman conquest (he is the first monarch to be buried there). Since then, Westminster Abbey has ruled supreme as the ultimate royal venue. Every monarch since 1066 has been crowned at the abbey, and 17 monarchs are buried beneath its huge Gothic arches. It has also seen more than its fair share of royal marriages. The current queen was married there, as was her father, King George VI, and two of her children, Anne and Andrew. But inevitably, in the modern world, Westminster Abbey is inextricably linked to the funeral of Princess Diana, and this is the reason many considered it an inappropriate venue for William and Kate's wedding. (Even today, some 12 years after the event, the harrowing image of Diana's coffin being carried into the abbey, draped in the royal standard and covered in lilies, reduces many to tears.) Still, by all accounts, William and Kate are indeed determined to be a traditional royal couple; despite the current recession, their wedding will be a celebration, with the pomp and circumstance only Great Britain can produce. Neither Kate nor William is making any radical concession to the modern world or demanding any changes in their royal duties. They scarcely have to. His parents had laid much groundwork for the updating of the monarchy. As strange as it may seem today, Charles and Diana were once considered a thoroughly modern couple. They decided, for example, that Diana would not promise to ""obey"" her husband at the marriage ceremony, their first-born would be the next monarch (as opposed to the first male child), and any children they did have would be brought up as close to a ""normal"" childhood as possible. (That the marriage ended in divorce is sad, but 50 percent of marriages in the UK today end in divorce; again, they were a thoroughly modern couple.) When William brought Kate out to face the world's press last week, standing together as equals, so obviously in love, you could see how successful Charles and Diana have been. William and Kate are now the golden couple of a very modern monarchy, and it is predominantly because of the influence of his parents (and some help from the queen) that Britain's future king has embraced this position with such maturity. The monarchy today is a vastly different institution from the one Diana joined all those years ago. The queen now reigns over a multiracial, multifaith, multiethnic population. Prince Charles has acknowledged this fact by promising to be defender of faith, as opposed to defender of the faith when he is crowned king. Such realities give the lie to the doom merchants crawling out of the woodwork and condemning the monarchy as an archaic institution that has no role in the modern world. The marriage of William and Kate at Westminster Abbey will be just the tonic a jaded Great Britain needs. Some may scoff, but it is interesting how fast the front pages of the world's newspapers and the schedules of the news channels were cleared once the official announcement was made last week; proving yet again that the House of Windsor is the longest-running, and best-loved, news story of them all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Saunders.","Mark Saunders says many royal watchers thought William and Kate would wed at St. Paul's .

"Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) -- An American-born man accused of posting an online attack against the creators of the animated TV series ""South Park"" due to a depiction of the Prophet Mohammed agreed to plead guilty Wednesday to providing material support to terrorists and other charges. Under the agreement announced in federal court, Zachary Chesser, 20, also pleaded guilty to charges of communicating threats and soliciting crimes of violence. The three charges carry a total maximum prison sentence of 30 years, and U.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady told Wednesday's court hearing that Chesser's defense agreed to a sentence of at least 20 years for acts ""intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism."" O'Grady accepted the plea agreement and declared Chesser guilty as charged, setting the sentencing for February 25, 2011. Chesser, dressed in a green prison jumpsuit with the word ""prisoner"" stenciled on the back, answered questions from the judge but made no statement. His once-long hair had been cut short. Michael Nachmanoff, Chesser's federal public defender, said the case was different from other recent terrorism cases. ""Mr. Chesser has renounced violent jihad,"" Nachmanoff said. ""He has accepted responsibility and is deeply remorseful. He is a young man who has taken the first steps towards putting his life back together. You saw one of those first steps today."" As part of the plea agreement, federal authorities agreed not to seek charges of aiding and abetting against Chesser's wife - Proscovia Kampire Nzabanita. She already is charged with making a false statement, which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison upon conviction. The couple has an infant son. During the half-hour hearing, Chesser's defense said federal prosecutors agreed not to request that Chesser serve his time in the federal ""supermax"" prison in Colorado. Chesser, a convert to Islam, is accused of posting an online attack against the creators of the animated TV series ""South Park,"" as well as information on explosives meant to be used to kill civilians. Prosecutors also say Chesser, of Fairfax County, Virginia, had exchanged e-mails with Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, whose name has been linked to an attack and an attempted attack on the United States. Chesser was questioned in 2009 about his internet postings and e-mail communications with al-Awlaki. U.S. officials revealed that they had been staging court-ordered electronic surveillance of Chesser. In April, Chesser, who also goes by the name Abu Talhah al Amrikee, authored a post on a radical Islamic website that included a warning to the creators of ""South Park"" after an episode of the cartoon series depicted the Prophet Mohammed in a bear suit. The posting on Revolutionmuslim.com says: ""We have to warn Matt [Stone] and Trey [Parker] that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show. This is not a threat, but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them."" Van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker, was murdered by an Islamic extremist in 2004 after making a short documentary on violence against women in some Islamic societies. The internet posting features a graphic photograph of van Gogh with his throat cut and a dagger in his chest. The entry goes on to advise readers: ""You can contact them [the makers of ""South Park""], or pay Comedy Central or their own company a visit at these addresses ... "" and lists Comedy Central's New York address and the Los Angeles, California, address of Parker and Stone's production company. Chesser told CNN at the time that providing the addresses was not intended as a threat but to give people the opportunity to protest. An affidavit from prosecutors details other videos and postings from Chesser, including a link to an Army Ranger handbook with information on explosive devices and a post about ""desensitizing"" police by leaving fake suspicious bags around in public places. An FBI agent who spoke with Chesser on July 14 said that ""Chesser stated that he was an influential person in the Jihadi community, and could be considered one of the top individuals in this area."" Chesser tried to fly to Uganda on July 10 and then on to Somalia. According to an affidavit, he tried to take his infant son with him, telling his wife it was part of his ""cover"" to make it less likely anyone would suspect he was trying to go to Somalia to join the militant group Al-Shabaab. The court documents said Chesser was not allowed to depart the country July 10 but was told by the airline he was on the ""no-fly list"" and was questioned by a Secret Service agent. He was not arrested, and according to the documents, he contacted an FBI agent and said he wanted to provide information about Al-Shabaab. In subsequent interviews with the FBI, Chesser allegedly said he had been in contact with Al-Shabaab, felt that he would have no problem joining the group when he reached Somalia and knew it had been designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. government. Court documents say Chesser thought that after training, he would be placed in the group's media branch but that people in that position still engage in fighting. Chesser was arrested on July 21. A search of Chesser's home uncovered a handwritten note called ""How to Destroy the West"" that contained a bulleted list of activities. ""Under the attacks on personnel,"" the affidavit said, Chesser wrote ""put out a message to the Muslims to go buy guns and kill soldiers"" and ""Fill a tanker with explosives and Ricin,""  a toxic protein extracted from castor beans.

"(CNN) -- Villarreal were denied the chance to return to the top of Spain's La Liga after an incident-packed 2-2 draw at promoted Hercules on Monday night in which three players were sent off. Hercules led 2-1 with goals from new signings Nelson Valdez and David Trezeguet, but the latter was sent off just before halftime and Villarreal leveled through Borja Valero -- who later left the field for a second yellow card before defender Mateo Musacchio received a straight red. The visitors, who would have moved a point clear of Real Madrid with victory in Alicante, hit the post early on through Brazilian striker Nilmar but fell behind in the 26th minute when Paraguay striker Valdez scored following Royston Drenthe's free-kick. Spain full-back Joan Capdevila equalized from close range three minutes later following a low Angel Lopez cross, then teammate Giuseppe Rossi hit the post. However, Trezeguet pounced to net his fourth league goal since arriving from Juventus when Villarreal could not clear Drenthe's right-wing cross, but the 33-year-old former France star was dismissed for two quickfire yellow cards for dissent after Valero fouled Valdez. Villarreal made their extra man pay off just after the hour mark when Valero drilled in a right-foot low shot after home goalkeeper Jose Calatayud blocked efforts from Nilmar  and Rossi. Villarreal wasted several more chances before losing Valero in the 81st minute when the on-loan midfielder was booked for handball, then three minutes later Musacchio brought down Drenthe with the Argentine ruled to be the last line of defense. That gave Hercules the advantage, but Drenthe and Abraham Paz were denied in injury-time by goalkeeper Diego Lopez. The result left Villarreal in second place above Barcelona and Valencia on goal difference, with all three teams having 16 points from seven matches. Hercules are 10th in the 20-team league, with eight points -- nine behind Real and above Real Mallorca, Sporting Gijon and Levante on goal difference. Meanwhile, Blackburn Rovers survived the first-half dismissal of key defender Christopher Samba to earn a 0-0 draw at home to Sunderland in Monday's only English Premier League clash. The Congo international was sent off in the third minute of injury-time after bringing down Sunderland's on-loan striker Danny Welbeck just outside the penalty area. The draw -- Sunderland's fifth in a row -- left both teams just three points above the bottom three after eight games.","Former France star David Trezeguet scores and is sent off as Hercules draw with Villarreal .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China on Tuesday stepped up criticism of Norway and the awarding of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, a leading Chinese dissident. Liu is serving an 11-year prison term after repeatedly calling for human rights and democratization. ""The Norwegian Nobel committee's decision to give Liu the Nobel Peace Prize will damage bilateral relations. There is reason for every Chinese person to be unhappy,"" Ma Zhaoxu, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a news briefing. ""We already made our position clear. Since reform and opening up, China has made remarkable progress,"" Ma said. ""By giving a convicted person the Nobel Peace Prize, they show no respect for China's judicial system."" ""It not only disrespects China, but also reveals their true intentions. If you try to change China's political system from the outside, or if they are trying to stop Chinese people from moving forward, that is obviously making a mistake,"" he added. Liu was sentenced in 2009 for inciting subversion of state power. He is the co-author of Charter 08, a call for political reform and human rights, and was an adviser to the student protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Asked about Liu's wife, Liu Xia, Ma responded: ""I do not know who you are talking about. I am not familiar with this person."" Liu Xia remains under house arrest in Beijing and has been banned from talking to friends or media, Liu Xiaobo's lawyer said. She is trying to visit the attorney to discuss an appeal to her husband's sentence. ""She is negotiating with the police on the terms of the visit,"" Shang Baojun, the lawyer, told CNN. ""The issue of an appeal is not if, but when and how."" Shang confirmed that Liu Xia said her husband wanted her to go to Oslo to accept the award in December, but he is not optimistic about the prospect. ""It's way too early to think about her Norway trip, considering she can't even leave her house,"" he said. Liu Xia briefly re-gained phone access Tuesday, talking to Shang and several friends, as well as a few media outlets, from a new mobile phone after police broke her old one. The new number has been disconnected again, her friends tweeted Tuesday evening. On U.S. President Barack Obama's call for Liu's release, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma said: ""We oppose anyone making issue of this and anyone interfering in China's internal affairs."" Asked whether Liu might be allowed to collect his Nobel in person, Ma said that, as a criminal, what he can or can't do is determined by China's legal system.","NEW: Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo wants his wife to accept his prize, Liu's lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- A decorated flight nurse who had been dismissed under the ""don't ask, don't tell"" military policy, will be reinstated with the U.S. Air Force, the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington  announced Tuesday. The ACLU of Washington represented Maj. Margaret Witt in a four-year-long lawsuit seeking her reinstatement. In September, the U.S. District Court for Western Washington ordered the  Air Force to reinstate Witt. The court found that Witt's sexual  orientation does not negatively impact unit morale or cohesion. On  Tuesday, the Justice Department filed an appeal of that ruling, but it is not  seeking a stay of the order to reinstate Witt, clearing the way for her to rejoin the service. ""I am thrilled to be able to serve in the Air Force again,"" Witt said in statement released Tuesday. ""The men and women in the unit are like family members to me, and I've been waiting a long time to rejoin them."" There was no immediate Justice Department response Tuesday to a CNN request for comment. The case is one of a number of challenges to the 1993 policy that prevents gay men and lesbians from openly serving in the military and  bars officials from inquiring into a service member's sexuality. Legislation that would repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy has passed the House and is expected to be voted on the Senate in coming weeks. In the summer of 2004, Witt was notified that the Air Force had begun an investigation into an allegation that she had engaged in homosexual conduct. She was placed on unpaid leave and told she could not participate in military duties, pending formal separation proceedings. In 2006 she was discharged on grounds of homosexual conduct. In 2008, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Air Force must prove that Witt's discharge was necessary for purposes of military readiness. The ruling sent the case back to the trial court. saying that before discharging a soldier under the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, the military must prove that the individual's conduct hurts morale and unit cohesion. The requirement is now known as the ""Witt Standard."" In September, Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Todd Vician said the Air Force believed that ""Maj. Witt's discharge was fully consistent with the law and thus appropriate."" During her 19-year career in the Air Force, Witt served in the Persian Gulf.","The government files an appeal, but Maj. Margaret Witt is being reinstated in the Air Force .

"(CNN) -- A wrongful death lawsuit filed in the aftermath of a July boat accident questions the safety of amphibious tour vessels, but the so-called duck boats' record indicates just two fatal accidents in more than 50 years of service. On July 7, a 250-foot sludge barge pushed by a tugboat overran a disabled 33-foot Ride the Ducks tour boat, plunging the amphibious vessel with its 35 passengers and two crew members under the surface of the Delaware River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Two student tourists from Hungary, Dora Schwendtner, 16, and Szabolcs Prem, 20, drowned. Ten other passengers suffered minor injuries, according to a National Transportation Safety Board initial report released September 10. Ride the Ducks has suspended its Philadelphia operation since the accident, but company President Chris Herschend said he expected tours to resume soon. The company is working out details with the U.S. Coast Guard and the city. In a statement released to the media, Herschend pointed to the tugboat's failure to heed repeated radio calls alerting it to the disabled vessel in its path. A lawsuit filed on behalf of the students' parents claims, among other things, that duck boats are inherently unsafe. ""There is no doubt that Dora and Szeb, on their first trip to America, thought they were safe when they boarded the duck boat. They had no idea they were on an accident waiting to happen,"" said Holly Ostrov Ronai, one of the attorneys who filed the suit. But officials with the Coast Guard and Ride the Ducks say the vessels have an excellent safety record. ""Thirty-three years we've been in this business, Ride the Ducks, and we've never had so much as a wet shoelace before this tragedy,"" Herschend told CNN. Since starting operations in Philadelphia in 2003 , Ride the Ducks has safely transported more than 1 million passengers on more than 42,000 tours in the Pennsylvania city, a company statement said. Ride the Ducks is a subsidiary of Herschend Family Entertainment of Norcross, Georgia. The company owns Ride the Ducks operations in six locations, as well as the Dollywood theme park in Tennessee, Stone Mountain Park in Georgia, and other attractions. The original duck boat, with a standard Army six-wheel truck frame and a propeller, was designed to ferry troops and materiel from warships to land during World War II. General Motors Corp. built 21,000 of the vessels, officially called DUKWs, between 1942 and 1945, when production ceased. Most were scrapped after the war, but entrepreneurs converted a few dozen for jolly excursions across land and water for tourists. Herschend's 90 or so boats are latter-day replicas, manufactured at a Branson, Missouri, shop and designed to look like the WWII workhorses. Today, 128 duck-style boats have certificates to remain in service with several companies, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Only one other fatal accident involving a DUKW has been documented. In 1999, the Miss Majestic -- owned by a now-defunct company -- sank in Lake Hamilton near Hot Springs, Arkansas; 13 passengers drowned. The NTSB investigated the accident and recommended several changes to ducks' design and operation standards, but the Coast Guard did not concur. Read the NTSB's preliminary report on the accident . Citing ""an unacceptable level of risk to passenger safety,"" the NTSB recommended in May 2002 that duck operators and refurbishers ""provide reserve buoyancy through passive means,"" such as installing watertight compartments or buoyant foam in the hull. Modern boats include such features. The NTSB also found that several of the Miss Majestic victims were trapped under the vessel's canopy as it rapidly sank and recommended that duck canopies be removed or modified to come off easily in an emergency. In a September 2002 response, the Coast Guard said existing regulations and standards, if followed, were sufficient to ensure passenger safety. ""When you follow the navigation rules, usually everything goes fine,"" Capt. Eric Christensen, chief of the Office of Vessel Activity at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, told CNN recently. ""The Coast Guard doesn't certificate inherently unsafe vessels,"" he said. Robert Mongeluzzi, an attorney representing the Philadelphia victims' families, says that's not a good answer. ""If they had canopies that were retractable and foldable -- like we've had on convertible cars for about 100 years -- they wouldn't have that problem"" of trapping passengers underwater, he said. Coast Guard regulations do not require duck passengers to wear personal flotation devices (PFDs), which puts them in danger of drowning, Mongeluzzi said. But the devices could pin their wearers against the vessel's canopy, which is what happened to several victims in the Arkansas accident, according to the NTSB. ""If you keep the canopy on, then you're damned if you do and damned if you don't,"" said Mongeluzzi, who characterizes the canopies as ""death cages."" ""If you put your PFD on, it's harder to get out. If you don't put your PFD on, you're more likely to drown. Passengers on a sightseeing cruise should never be faced with that life-or-death decision."" The preliminary NTSB report on the Philadelphia accident did not indicate whether passengers were wearing PFDs, but eyewitness accounts and images from the scene showed some were and some weren't when they were rescued. Ride the Ducks' Herschend says the circumstances of the 1999 Arkansas disaster and this summer's accident in Philadelphia were completely different, but his company's focus is always on safety. ""None of us are OK with this, and none of us want to ever go through it again,"" he said. The lawsuit is not likely to come to trial in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas for two to three years, Mongeluzzi said.","NTSB warned in 2002 that canopies on excursion vessels could trap passengers .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Rescuers in Chile have just another 89 meters (292 feet) left to drill and are expected to break through into the area where 33 miners are trapped by Saturday, Chilean Mines Minister Laurence Golborne said Thursday. Depending on whether engineers decide to encase the rescue shaft with steel casing, the 33 miners could be extracted from the collapsed San Jose gold and copper mine within two to 10 days after breakthrough, Golborne added. The miners have been trapped in a chamber since August 5. They are in contact with the outside world through a small bore hole that is being used to send them food, water, supplies and other necessities. Rescue crews have been drilling three separate, wider holes to send down a rescue capsule that will bring the men to the surface. Those rescue attempts have been labeled Plans A, B and C. ""We're advancing pretty well in Plan B. We restarted the drilling process and are hoping we can get contact more or less this Saturday. Depending [on] if we have to change the drill hammer or not it could be a bit earlier, but we're predicting [the] date for Saturday,"" Golborne said. Mine engineers will have to decide whether they need to encase the shaft with steel tubing to prevent rockfalls and further collapses as they extract the miners. ""We have to wait two, three or four days if we do not encase and eight to 10 days if we do the encasing. That will be based on technical matters decided by technical experts,"" he added. . The so-called Plan B drill, a Schramm T-130 rig, hit a depth of 535 meters by 8 a.m. Thursday following a 20-hour stoppage to change drill hammers and to survey the rescue shaft with a miniature camera. Earlier this week, the Plan B drill cut through 53 meters in just 12 hours, which means technically it could cover the remaining 89 meters down to the miners in just 20 hours. One of the rescue coordinators, Rene Aguilar, an engineer for state copper company CODELCO, said earlier this week they may encase the first 100 meters of the shaft, a process that could take just 10 hours. Once the miners are extracted they will undergo about two hours of health checks at a field hospital that has been set up at the mine. They will then be reunited with one or two immediate family members. Next, all 33 will be flown by military helicopter to the regional hospital in the city of Copiapo -- approximately a 15-minute flight. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Sept. 19 during his last visit to the mine that he planned to personally hug each of the 33 miners as they were pulled from the rescue shaft. He is due to depart on a government tour to Europe mid-month. First lady Cecilia Morel de Pinera is expected to arrive at the San Jose mine sometime Friday, Golborne said. ""Her plan is to spend some time with the miners' families,"" he said. Maria Segovia, sister of trapped miner Dario Segovia, said relatives would begin a vigil Thursday night that they will keep until a drill breaks through to the miners.","NEW: ""Plan B"" drill has just another 89 meters to go to break through .

"(CNN)  -- Facebook gets a lot of attention for being, uh, your space -- a handful of entry fields in which to sum up your awesomeness, right down to the bewildering ""Write something about yourself"" box. Researchers fixate on what your profile says about you, while increasingly complex pages, plug-ins and boxes (what are those all about, anyway?) make it clear that Facebook is all about you. Still, at least one tab of your Facebook profile is largely left to others' devices: the wall.

VBS.TV is VICE's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Four Corners region of U.S. (VBS.TV) -- Earlier this fall. VBS.TV went to the Four Corners region of the United States to hang out with indigenous cowboys of the Navajo (Diné) tribe. These riders were all from the Triple B Association -- a bronc-riding, bull-riding and barrel-racing league catering to the Native American community of the U.S. Southwest. Given the difficult economic circumstances under which most of these cowboys and their families live, it's an unusual portrait of Americana in the 21st century. Early this year, it was reported that more than 56 percent of Navajos live below the poverty line, one of the highest rates in the U.S., even among the traditionally marginalized indigenous communities. Add to that a frightening unemployment rate climbing above 50 percent --disconcertingly higher than the national rate, which hovers around 9.5 percent --and the picture is extremely bleak. Many of these families throughout New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado also lack electricity, running water or telephones. Still, theirs is a spiritually rich culture, based on family-operated, small-scale farming and ranching. Though the professional rodeo circuit offers a slight opportunity for some of the best riders, by and large members of this community are relegated to the Navajo league. The best many can hope for is a berth at the Indian National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, Nevada, each year. The winnings are not high and neither is the exposure compared with many of the larger stadium rodeo events. Triple B, like several other rodeo associations, provides young riders with an opportunity to sign up and compete against each other from March to November each year. The cost to enter can be high, and if you don't win, you have to find a way home, struggle to get back in the circuit in upcoming weeks and somehow find the resources to feed the livestock that await back home. The Navajo riders have managed to get a degree of mainstream exposure over the years, mostly because bull and bronc riding are becoming a big-buck industry elsewhere in the U.S. Over the course of a week, we tailed several of the group's riders all across the region, accompanying them during training and traveling with them to and from assorted events. Over that time, we came to know their families, witnessing as they coped with personal struggles and sharing in occasional successes.

"(CNN) -- Two additional homicide charges were announced Thursday against a suspected serial stabber who was trying to board an overseas flight when he was arrested, Michigan authorities said. Elias Abuelazam is a suspect in 18 stabbings in three states.  Five of the attacks were fatal -- all of those in Genesee County, Michigan, said the county's prosecutor, David Leyton. Four of the 18 attacks occurred in Ohio and Virginia. Abuelazam has been charged with homicide in three of the five deaths. Earlier, defense attorney Edwar Zeineh told CNN that he expected ""up to four new murder charges"" to be announced Thursday. However, Leyton said Thursday that the remaining cases are still under investigation. ""There is a lot we have to comb through,"" the prosecutor said. Previously, Abuelazam, 34, faced one murder count, five counts of assault with intent to commit murder and one charge of malicious destruction of property -- all related to attacks in Michigan. The new charges stem from separate fatal stabbings of two Michigan men, one 43 and another 60. In the first case, a witness identified Abuelazam as the stabber after seeing his photo on television, Leyton said. In the second, police obtained a search warrant for Abuelazam's luggage after he boarded a plane in Louisville, Kentucky, that was bound for Atlanta, Georgia. He was arrested August 11 at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where he was set to board a flight to Israel, police said. Investigators found a pair of sneakers in his baggage with evidence of blood matching the DNA of the 60-year-old victim, Leyton said. Abuelazam was indicted last week by a grand jury in Toledo, Ohio, in the stabbing of a church janitor. Zeineh said he does not believe investigators have insurmountable proof against his client. ""I still feel strongly there is reasonable doubt based on my review of the evidence so far,"" he said, without mentioning specifics. Abuelazam's mother recently flew from Israel to Flint, Michigan, to see her son, and has made several jailhouse visits. ""Her presence there as a mom was to empower her son,"" Zeineh said. ""She helped him gather his thoughts and be [a] productive member of his defense team."" The three-state string of attacks began in May and ended in August. Most of the stabbing victims were African-American. Federal officials have not provided a motive for the attacks. Leesburg, Virginia, Police Chief Joseph Price has said he believed the attacker was targeting African-Americans. Abuelazam is believed responsible for three attacks in Leesburg. If convicted in Michigan, Abuelazam could face life in prison without parole. The state does not have the death penalty. Authorities had Abuelazam in custody twice in a two-week stretch, both within hours of reports of stabbings, but he was released. Police said he had not been linked to the attacks at the time. Abuelazam was arrested August 5 after a traffic stop and July 29 for allegedly providing alcohol to a minor. He was fined $125 in July. In the traffic stop arrest, in Arlington, Virginia, police arrested Abuelazam after learning he had an outstanding warrant for assault. A knife and hammer were found in his car. Authorities now believe both weapons were used in the string of stabbings. One of the attacks took place in Virginia hours after Abuelazam was released. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Two more homicide charges are filed against Abuelazam, who is jailed in Michigan .

"(CNN) -- Mexican marines have captured an alleged top leader of the Beltran Leyva cartel, handing authorities a major victory in their fight against powerful drug organizations, the government said Sunday. Sergio Villarreal, who is known to Mexican officials as ""El Grande,"" was taken in the central Mexican state of Puebla, Alejandro Poire, a spokesman for Mexico's president on security issues, told reporters. Villarreal has appeared on the attorney general's list of Mexico's most wanted and had a bounty of more than $2 million on his head. He offered no resistance when he was arrested mid-afternoon, along with two suspected accomplices, said Poire. He added authorities also recovered weapons and armed vehicles in the operation. ""This afternoon, the federal government ... dealt another blow to the criminal organizations that threaten Mexicans' security,"" Poire said. Villarreal's capture comes soon after the August arrest of American-born ""La Barbie,"" or Edgar Valdez, believed to be one of Mexico's most ruthless drug traffickers. Valdez is similarly thought to have belonged to the Beltran Leyva cartel. The former leader of that group, Arturo Beltran Leyva, was killed in a shootout with Mexican officials last year. Beltran's brother Carlos was later arrested, creating what authorities said was a vacuum and power struggle in one of Mexico's strongest cartels. More than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon intensified the government's fight against cartels and organized crime after taking office in 2006, according to government figures.","NEW: Two suspected accomplices were also arrested, an official says .

"(CNN) -- China closed 1,355 small coal mines this year, according to Xinhua, the country's state-run press agency. The effort is part of a larger plan to restructure the mining industry to prevent deadly accidents and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Xinhua reported, citing the National Energy Administration (NEA). China has one of the world's deadliest records for miners, with poor safety standards accounting for thousands of deaths each year. According to the China Mining Association, the goal is to eventually boost the industry. Small coal mines, which use outdated technology, will be replaced with larger coal mines, increasing capacity. Davitt McAteer, former press secretary for the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, called the move a response to the consequences of China's ""unmitigated economic growth."" ""If you emphasize production so much ... and you fail to balance the needs of the individual with the needs of the community, you get all kinds of disasters in terms of health and environment,"" he said. China is the largest global producer and consumer of coal, comprising 75 percent of China's total energy consumption. Approximately 11,000 small coal mines are still in operation.","Effort targets deadly accidents, pollution .

"(CNN) -- Since 1992, Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow has dedicated his life to helping people in need. Today, his Mary's Meals program, run from a tin shed in the Scottish Highlands, provides free daily meals to more than 400,000 children around the world. Below are his thoughts on being chosen as a Top 10 CNN Hero. Q: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero? Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow: When I got the call, I was actually in a car on the way from Edinburgh, Scotland's capital. Mary's Meals was chosen to be part of the festivities to celebrate the pope's visit and his historic meeting with the queen. Mary's Meals volunteers turned out in force and spent the day on the streets, collecting cans and handing out Mary's Meals literature. As usual, we were astounded by people's generosity. Your incredible news made an already fantastic day even more wonderful. I was genuinely shocked to learn I had made the Top 10, especially because I have been so moved and impressed by all those other people featured as Heroes. Q: What do you hope it will mean to Mary's Meals for you to be a Top 10 CNN Hero? MacFarlane-Barrow: I still feel a little embarrassed by this whole thing. Mary's Meals is a movement -- thousands of people all over globe doing small things every day so that hungry children can be fed, no one doing anything spectacular, just lots and lots of little acts of love. So to be singled out can sometimes feel slightly embarrassing. But at the same time, I know that this is the most incredible opportunity we have ever had to raise awareness of this vital work. I have no doubt that by highlighting the work of Mary's Meals to a global audience, CNN is going to enable many more hungry children to start receiving daily meals in school. And that makes me so, so happy. Q: What do you want people to know most about your work? MacFarlane-Barrow: In this world of plenty, no child need starve. And yet today, thousands will die of hunger-related causes. Our vision -- that every child in the world receive one good meal every day in a place of education -- can be realized.","Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow started Mary's Meals to ensure a meal a day for children in school .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray crushed Roger Federer in straight sets in a one-sided final to claim victory in the Shanghai Masters on Sunday. The Briton, who also defeated the former world number one in the Toronto Masters final in August, took just under 90 minutes to secure a 6-3 6-2 victory. World number four Murray has now beaten Federer eight times in their 13 meetings, although has crucially lost both times they have met in the final of a grand slam (U.S. Open in 2008 and this year's Australian Open final).

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- The court date of a man held after deadly bombings in Nigeria has been postponed because of fears about his safety in custody, his lawyer said Monday. Henry Okah is being held in a Johannesburg, South Africa, prison, but his lawyer, Rudi Krause, wants him separated from the general prison population for his safety, he said. He is being charged under terrorism legislation, Krause said. Extradition has not been discussed, he added. The prosecutor and police have applied for the hearing to be postponed to Tuesday morning, the lawyer said. Okah is suspected of being an influential member of the group that took responsibility for the bombings that killed 12 people and injured 50 in Nigeria on Friday. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, known as MEND, issued a statement Saturday saying it had given the Nigerian government advance warning. The Nigerian Intelligence Service said Monday that nine people have been arrested and are being questioned in connection with the blasts Friday in the nation's capital, Abuja. Authorities are still seeking two men, identified as Chima Orlu and Ben Jessy, whom they accuse of being the ""masterminds"" of the plot. But sources close to MEND told CNN that the two men are ""not known to be MEND operatives or known to be active on the Niger Delta issue."" They also raised concerns about the nine other arrests, calling them an ""attempt by the Nigerian government to be seen to act."" Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has appointed Andrew Azazi, his former chief of defense staff, to be the country's national security adviser in the wake of the bombings, Jonathan's office told CNN on Monday. The attack came as the West African country celebrated 50 years of independence. MEND blamed the government for the deaths. ""The irresponsible attitude of the government security forces is to blame for the loss of lives,"" the MEND statement said. ""The security forces were also warned one full hour to the first bomb blast ahead of the general alert sent to the media and told to steer the public from all parked cars which was not done,"" the statement continued. Jonathan later called the action a terrorist attack that was designed to ""disrupt"" the anniversary, presidential spokesman Imo Niboro said. But he said it had nothing to do with Niger Delta issues or MEND. MEND, which represents militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta, is an umbrella organization of several rebel groups. It has been battling the government for years over fairer distribution of the country's oil wealth. MEND said Okah had been harassed by authorities in South Africa, where he lives, but denied his involvement. ""Okah has never been involved in any MEND operations but has always been blamed for every attack, which is strange to us,"" MEND's statement said. CNN's Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","Henry Okah is thought to be a top member of the group that said it bombed Nigeria's capital .

"(CNN) -- Bermuda, which hasn't seen a major hurricane in some seven years, is about to get walloped by Igor, which forecasters termed large and dangerous Saturday night. The eye of the Category 2 storm may pass just to the west of the Atlantic Ocean island late Sunday, sharply increasing the likelihood of damaging winds, forecasters said. Such a landfall would spare Bermuda ""the worst of the storm surge, but will inflict some of the highest wind speeds ... on the island,"" said CNN meteorologist Angela Fritz. ""A direct hit would be the worst-case scenario, because the island would have to endure the extremely strong winds in the eyewall, as well as a dangerously high storm surge,"" said added. The hurricane is currently going through an ""eyewall replacement cycle,"" and, during this time, accurately forecasting its track becomes more difficult, said Fritz. A new eye begins to develop around the old eye of a hurricane during the replacement cycle. ""Fortunately, the forecast is that Igor will not strengthen more before approaching Bermuda. It is expected to maintain Category 2 status,"" Fritz added. Conditions on the island were deteriorating late Saturday ahead of Igor's expected passover late Sunday or early Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Tropical storm-force winds extend 345 miles (555 kilometers) from Igor's center. ""The winds are definitely a concern,"" said CNN weather producer Judson Jones. ""Igor is expected to remain a dangerous hurricane as it approaches Bermuda,"" the Hurricane Center said. ""Igor is a very large hurricane."" As of 11 p.m. EST Saturday, Igor was about 285 miles (455 km) south of Bermuda, packing sustained winds of about 100 mph (160 kph) as it headed north-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended up to 90 miles (150km) from the center. The storm could also produce as much as 9 inches of rainfall over the island, according to the Hurricane Center. Hurricane Fabian hit Bermuda in 2003, killing at least four people. It came ashore with 120 mph (193 kph) winds. Large waves generated by the storm were already pounding beaches Saturday afternoon, said CNN iReporter Michael Branco. ""A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant coastal flooding on Bermuda,"" the Hurricane Center said. ""The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves, especially along the southern coast."" The weather agency said swells will affect the East Coast of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Leeward Islands, Hispanola and parts of the Bahamas over the weekend. ""These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents,"" the Hurricane Center said. Branco, a native Bermudian, spent Saturday morning putting up storm blinds on his windows and securing his pets inside the house. On Friday, he stocked up on bottled water, canned food and batteries. He said that despite riding a number of storms out on the island, ""this one has my attention thus I am taking it very seriously."" Branco said he's most worried about potential damage to the roof of his home, which faces the island's southern shore -- the frontline for the approaching Igor's northerly track. ""Our roofs, which we use to catch our drinking water, can sometimes be vulnerable to high winds and pressure changes, so fingers crossed our roof is OK,"" he said. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Julia continued to diminish Saturday farther east in the Atlantic. As of 11 p.m. EST, Julia's maximum sustained winds were at 50 mph (85 kph), the Hurricane Center said. No coastal warnings or watches were in effect from Julia, and the storm is forecast to become a remnant low by early Monday, according to the hurricane center.","Igor termed a large and dangerous hurricane .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid took a big step toward reaching the second round of the Champions League with a 2-0 home win over Group G rivals AC Milan on Tuesday night, while Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Arsenal also maintained their perfect start to Europe's premier club competition. Real were beaten at home by the Italian side in the group stage last season, but the Spanish league leaders are now a different proposition under new coach Jose Mourinho, who led Inter Milan to final glory in May. The game was virtually over after only 14 minutes as Cristiano Ronaldo and Mezut Ozil scored within 60 seconds of each other. Ronaldo followed up his weekend double against Malaga with a free-kick that went straight through the middle of a poor defensive wall, leaving unsighted goalkeeper Marco Amelia with no chance. It was his fifth goal in three matches. The world's most expensive player then broke down the left and passed inside to Germany midfielder Ozil, whose shot took a wicked deflection off Daniele Bonera and looped over Amelia into the net. Milan went close to pulling a goal back in the 29th minute, but keeper Iker Casillas did well to tip Andrea Pirlo's fierce free-kick onto the crossbar. Real could not translate their attacking dominance into more goals, and in the 83rd minute needed captain Casillas to stop former Madrid forward Robinho from setting up a tense finale after coming on to replace Ronaldinho. Dutch side Ajax moved level with Milan on six points after beating Auxerre 2-1 at home in a match which saw three players sent off in the second half. Netherlands midfielder Demy de Zeeuw fired the four-time champions ahead in the seventh minute and Uruguay striker Luis Suarez made it 2-0 four minutes before halftime. But Ajax were reduced to 10 men in the 56th minute when defender Andre Ooijer brought down Dennis Oliech, allowing and Slovenia international Valter Birsa to score from the subsequent free-kick. However, Auxerre's hopes of earning a first point -- and perhaps a place in the Europa League -- faded when Oliech received his second yellow card for handball. Substitute Jean-Pascal Mignot did not even get on the field as he was ordered from the bench for dissent. German champions Bayern Munich needed two-own goals from Romania's CFR Cluj in order to come from behind and seal a 3-2 home victory in Group E. Ricardo Cadu headed the visitors in front in the 28th minute, but the Portuguese defender deflected a shot by Toni Kroos into his own net four minutes later and teammate Cristian Panin did the same from Holger Badstuber's effort on 37. Germany striker Mario Gomez made it 3-1 from close range with 13 minutes to play for a Bayern side missing several key players before Argentine midfielder Emmanuel Culio scored a late consolation for Cluj, who suffered a second defeat. Swiss side Basel made it three teams on three points with a 3-1 victory away to previously second-placed Roma. Alexander Frei put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute after being set up by a header from strike partner Marco Streller, but Italy forward Marco Borriello leveled nine minutes later from Francesco Totti's first-time throughball. Ghana fullback Samuel Inkoom restored Basel's lead just before the break with a fierce shot, while Roma's Rodrigo Taddei hit the post after the interval before substitute Cabral sealed victory in injury-time. Chelsea clinched a third successive victory in Group F with a 2-0 victory away to previously unbeaten Spartak Moscow in Tuesday's opening match. Russia international Yuri Zhirkov chose the perfect time to score his first goal for the English Premier League champions, lashing home a left-foot volley in the 24th minute after the home defense failed to properly clear a long ball forward. Nicolas Anelka doubled the lead just before halftime after Michael Essien won the ball in midfield and set him free, with the former France striker making up for wasting a similar earlier opportunity. French side Marseille kept alive hopes of reaching the second round, beating Slovakia's MSK Zilina to register their first points. Senegal defender Souleymane Diawara headed the only goal four minutes after halftime for the 1993 champions. Arsenal top Group H after crushing main rivals Shakhtar Donetsk 5-1 at home, with captain Cesc Fabregas marking his return from injury with a second-half penalty. Alexandre Song and Samir Nasri netted in the first half before Spain midfielder Fabregas struck from the penalty spot on the hour mark. Young midfielder Jack Wilshere and striker Marouane Chamakh made it three goals in less than 10 minutes before Croatia striker Edoardo came off the bench to score against his former club in the 82nd minute. Portugal's Sporting Braga won the battle of the group's two pointless teams, winning 2-0 at home to Partizan Belgrade. Lima's long-range free-kick put the competition debutants ahead 10 minutes before halftime, while fellow Brazilian striker Matheus condemned the Serbian side to a third successive defeat from a counter-attack in the final minute.","Real Madrid avenge last season's defeat by Milan to win third successive Group G match .

"(CNN) -- Headlines and pundits once again declare that we have a crisis on our hands in the wake of discovering that North Korea is building a new nuclear reactor and a uranium enrichment plant. More ominously, Tuesday brought news of direct artillery barrages between North and South Korea, heightening tensions and costing lives. But as provocative and serious as this is, neither is a crisis. Both fit a clear pattern of North Korean behavior -- a pattern that ultimately holds out the opportunity for progress. Unfortunately, so far the U.S. response also fits a pattern of rhetorical condemnation but little in the way of creative or effective engagement. Some key lessons need to be re-learned in light of these developments. First, the fundamental security situation with respect to North Korea has not changed. Pyongyang's estimated stockpile of plutonium bombs remains the same (four to eight bombs' worth). It does not have the capability to deliver these devices by aircraft or missile and its plutonium program remains frozen or perhaps even further eroded, as described in a report by Dr. Sig Hecker, who visited the North's nuclear facilities two weeks ago. Tuesday, in a briefing in Washington, Hecker, the former head of the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory, said that his report had been ""hyped"" in the media. He detailed how the new facilities, while potentially capable of producing material for bombs, are hardly the quickest route for North Korea to do so. Here's why. Uranium weapons are bigger than plutonium weapons, thus more difficult to shrink to the size needed for a missile warhead. The facility Hecker visited could only produce one or two bombs' worth of material a year, it is not clear when it will be fully operational and it has been built to replace the plutonium production facilities, not add to them. The new, small light-water reactor under construction is actually not very good for producing weapons-grade plutonium. If North Korea wanted to expand its nuclear arsenal, it makes much more sense for it to restart the plutonium reactor it has, not replace it with this new one. Finally, the North Koreans said they would scrap their plutonium capabilities completely in exchange for improved relations with the United States. In short, it is conceivable that the facilities are what the North claims, its attempt at home-grown nuclear energy, a goal the North has had for decades. As Hecker said, the trip raised ""as many questions as it answered."" Second, as difficult as engagement is, it is preferable to the alternative, isolation and instability. Remember that North Korea succeeded in acquiring or building these new facilities during a time when sanctions were extreme and U.S. engagement was absent. In fact, we only know about the facilities because of an unofficial visit by Americans whom the North wanted to use to reveal them. Before that, the Bush administration's years-long policy of complete isolation allowed North Korea to produce plutonium, fashion it into bombs and test two of them. Only in the last two years of the Bush era did a change in U.S. approach bear some fruit in freezing North Korea's programs. ""Strategic patience"" has been the nickname for the U.S. approach to North Korea since the early weeks of the Obama administration, when Pyongyang rejected early overtures of dialogue. What the administration failed to grasp is that diplomacy with the North is pretty much the most difficult exercise one can do in international relations. But that does not mean you shouldn't continue to try, even when -- or maybe especially when -- the response is a poke in the eye. So where does this leave us? What can or should the United States do to respond to these latest developments? Here again, everything old is new again: Creative, thoughtful approaches to engaging North Korea have to be designed and tested -- persistently. Yes, U.S. overtures will annoy allies in the region, but not if done in concert with or through consultation with them. Yes, the administration will suffer reactionary criticism from the right for ""dealing with evil"" or similar screeds. But the stakes are too high to allow the long-term threats that North Korea poses to be hamstrung by near-term political scorekeeping. President Obama has to be bold. A number of ideas about how to proceed are offered in a recent piece by Lee Sigal of the Social Sciences Research Council. These suggestions, including economic incentives and diplomatic measures such as a trip by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to North Korea and the conclusion of a peace declaration involving both Koreas and China, are a good starting point. Sun-tzu, an ancient Chinese expert on the region, advised, ""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer."" Good advice and as relevant as ever for the United States regarding North Korea. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Carroll and Joe Cirincione.","North Korea's artillery barrage was serious, but this is not a crisis, say co-authors .

"London, England (CNN) -- Daily doses of vitamin B can halve the rate of brain shrinkage in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which can be a precursor to Alzheimer's, researchers at Oxford University said Thursday. The two-year clinical trial is the largest to study the effect of vitamin B on MCI and one of the first disease-modifying trials in the Alzheimer's field to show positive results, the researchers said. The study followed 168 volunteers with mild memory problems, half of whom took a high-dose vitamin B tablet for two years and the other half who took a placebo. Around one in six people age 70 and older has MCI and experiences problems with memory, language, or other mental functions, but not to a degree that interferes with daily life, the researchers said. Around half of those with MCI develop dementia, mainly Alzheimer's, within five years of diagnosis. Certain B vitamins such as folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, are known to control levels of the amino acid homocysteine in the blood. High levels of homocysteine are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimers. Researchers used MRI scans to measure the rate of brain shrinkage over a two-year period. They found that on average, the brains of those taking a tablet that combined folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 shrank at a rate of 0.76 percent a year, while those in the placebo group had a mean brain shrinkage rate of 1.08 percent. Those with the highest levels of homocysteine benefited most, with atrophy rates on treatment that were half of those taking the placebo, researchers said. Because the rate of brain shrinkage is known to be more rapid in those with MCI who go on to develop Alzheimer's, it is possible that the vitamin treatment could slow down the development of the disease, they said. The researchers cautioned, however, that the relatively small number of participants and the short time span of the study meant more research is needed. ""These are immensely promising results, but we do need to do more trials to conclude whether these particular B vitamins can slow or prevent development of Alzheimer's,"" said David Smith of the Department of Pharmacology at Oxford and a co-leader of the trial. ""So I wouldn't yet recommend that anyone getting a bit older and beginning to be worried about memory lapses should rush out and buy vitamin B supplements without seeing a doctor."" The study was co-funded by the Alzheimer's Research Trust, a British research charity. Chief Executive Rebecca Wood said the results are important but also said they require further study. ""The strong findings must inspire an expanded trial to follow people expected to develop Alzheimer's, and we hope for further success,"" she said. The Alzheimer's Association also raised concerns about the study noting the small size, the fact that it was conducted at a single research center and that one of the researchers involved has patents in this area and might, under certain circumstances, result in his financially benefit. ""I don't think age was an issue in the effectiveness of the intervention, in this study. Homocysteine levels were. Only people with elevated homocysteine in the study showed benefit from the intervention. People with the lowest homocysteine levels in the study saw no benefit. So, B vitamins -- if it shown to be effective in further studies -- are unlikely to be beneficial for everyone, particularly if you already have healthy homocysteine levels,"" said William Thies, chief medical and scientific officer of the Alzeimer's Association. ""Clearly, this is not enough data to go on. No conclusions can be drawn from this single study about use of B vitamins in MCI (or Alzheimer's disease or related dementias). No recommendations can or should be made to doctors or the public regarding use of B vitamins based on this study. No clinical or personal habits should be changed as a result of this article."" The findings were published in the September issue of PLoS ONE, the journal of the non-profit Public Library of Science. The trial was supported by grants from Charles Wolfson Charitable Trust, Medical Research Council, Alzheimer's Research Trust, Henry Smith Charity, Thames Valley Dementias and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network of the National Institute for Health Research, John Coates Charitable Trust, Sidney and Elizabeth Corob Charitable Trust, and Meda AB/Recip AB, which also donated the vitamin and placebo tablets.","Vitamin B could halve the rate of brain shrinkage in those with mild cognitive impairment .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Pugh was standing in the Arctic in a Speedo about to plunge into water just shy of the freezing point when he came to grips with the challenge he was facing. ""My most dominant thought as I was standing on the edge of the sea ice,"" Pugh said, ""was just how frightened I was. The water's completely black; there are chunks of white ice in the water."" Pugh said he remembered thinking that if things went wrong, ""How long would it take for my frozen body to sink to the bottom of the ocean?"" Pugh didn't sink, and he completed a one-kilometer swim in 29-degree Fahrenheit (or -1.7 degree centigrade) water. (Since it was salt water it was below the normal freezing point of water.) But it came at a price. He lost feeling in his hands for four months. Watch an interview with Lewis Pugh . Pugh, a 40-year-old former reservist in Britain's special forces regiment, the Special Air Service, has gained worldwide attention for his extreme adventures, designed to dramatize the environmental threats to the planet. Whether it's swimming at the North Pole, or in a meltwater lake on Mount Everest, Pugh is constantly testing his own limits and calling attention to urgent issues. ""Swimming has been a very effective medium for telling a story about the state of our planet,"" Pugh told CNN. TED.com: Ben Saunders skis to the North Pole . The son of an admiral in the British navy, Pugh and his family moved to South Africa when he was 10. Educated there and at Cambridge University, Pugh became a maritime lawyer but grew dissatisfied with the profession. A friend said to him, ""Lewis, if you don't follow your own dreams in life, then you're going to be following somebody's else's dreams."" TED.com: John Wooden on true success . Swimming is his dream. His adventures have taken him to every ocean and many other bodies of water; swimming Norway's longest fjord, swimming the English Channel, swimming in the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, swimming the full length of the River Thames, swimming from Robben Island to Cape Town. ""I want to swim until the last day of my life,"" Pugh says. Pugh says he was driven to attempt record-setting coldwater swims because the warm-water swimming challenges had already been conquered. He doesn't think that his ability to survive cold-water swimming adventures is due to any physical advantage over others, but rather to a resolve never to give up. As he was about to dive into the Arctic, he says, that mental attitude came into play. ""The most immediate thing you have to do is to just squeeze out the fear, because otherwise the fear will just paralyze you. And then commit 100 percent.... I wanted to swim a kilometer across the North Pole. And I wanted to do it to demonstrate graphically to the world what was happening in the Arctic, because the North Pole should be frozen over. TED.com: Aimee Mullins on running . ""I remember thinking to myself, if things go bad, I'll get out after 500 meters...if you think about a swim like that, that's the worst way of thinking. What you're doing is confusing your subconscious, because you're planning for victory and defeat at the same time. ""So the only way I could get into that water was to get as aggressive as possible -- not wild aggression, controlled aggression -- and to get really focused, and then commit 100 percent to doing the full kilometer and then just dive in, go for it. ""It took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds, it was just grueling, make no bones about it. The human body is not designed for swimming in minus 1.7 degree centigrade water. The passengers of the Titanic perished in water of 5 degrees centigrade. So this water is 7 degrees centigrade colder. It's very grueling on the body, and afterward when I came out, my fingers were swollen. ""We're made partially of water, so the cells in my fingers had actually frozen and expanded and burst. It damaged the nerve cells, it took me four months to feel my fingers again, but now everything's fine. ""But the more lasting damage is the psychological impact it has on you because if you haven't felt your hands for four months, you are cautious about going and pushing the boundaries again."" Yet Pugh didn't let that stop him. In May, two and a half years after the Arctic swim, he was on Mount Everest, swimming in rarefied air at a high altitude. ""One of the hardest things was to get back in water which was very, very cold, and at 5.5 kilometers above sea level."" Given the physical damage he suffered after the North Pole swim, Pugh says he ""had to work hard on putting that swim behind me, forgetting about it, and starting with a fresh clean slate."" ""It's almost like when a computer's got a virus, you clean that hard drive... that's what I had to do in my mind, clean my mind."" In the SAS, the special forces, he said, there is a saying that its initials stand for ""speed, aggression, surprise."" He adopted that approach in the world of coldwater swimming, swimming as fast as he could, with as much adrenalin as possible, to ""fend off the cold."" It didn't work in the high-altitude conditions of Mt. Everest. ""You can't bully Mt .Everest, it's very difficult to breathe up there...So I had to adopt a much calmer approach, one with a lot of humility, and I had to work with the mountain rather than against the mountain."" Pugh swam more slowly, using the breaststroke, and completed the kilometer in just under 23 minutes. [In more normal water conditions, he swims a kilometer in about 14 minutes.] . Pugh says his father and mother, who was a nursing officer in the British navy, set an example of persistence. ""Those people from that generation were not quitters."" ""I just never, ever want to give up. Most battles are won in the 11th hour, and most people give up,"" he says. ""If you give up once, it's quite hard. If you give up a second time, it's a little bit easier. Give up a third time, it's starting to become a habit."" Pugh is planning for another epic challenge, but he won't say what it will be. The only hint he will give is that it will dramatize a threat to another of the world's major ecosystems. ""The problem with climate change is that it's quite complicated for the ordinary person to understand."" Scientists will constantly refine their work, giving new and varied interpretations of the data, and people may get confused. He's hoping his swims can help: . ""They're not confused when they see somebody swimming across the North Pole, across an open patch of sea.""","Swimmer Lewis Pugh uses extreme adventures to dramatize environmental perils .

"Islamabad, Pakistan -- The data recorders for the plane that crashed and killed 152 people in Pakistan have been found, a government official said Saturday. Junaid Amin, the head of Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, told CNN the plane's voice and the flight data recorders have been found at the crash site. He says the analysis of the data and completing the crash investigation could take several months. Amin said the items will be sent to Germany or France since Pakistan doesn't have facilities to perform the analyses. The Airblue plane was headed to Islamabad from the sea port city of Karachi on Wednesday when it crashed in a hillside while trying to land. Pakistan observed a day of mourning Thursday for victims of the accident - the worst passenger plane crash on Pakistani soil. Officials do not know if weather played a factor in the crash Wednesday. Pakistan is in the midst of the annual monsoon season, when rain sweeps across the subcontinent from June until September. The deadliest crash involving a Pakistani airline occurred in September 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a mountain in Nepal, killing all 167 people on board, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported. The Airbus A321 was carrying 146 passengers and six crew members, the airline said. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan said two of the people aboard were American citizens.","The data recorders will be sent to Europe .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Sony blamed the global economic slowdown, increased competition and an appreciating yen for a 95 percent drop in third-quarter profits, as the company announced its results Thursday. Customers check Sony's Bravia brand LCD TVs at an electronics shop in Tokyo, Japan. Profits for the quarter, which ended December 31, fell from nearly 200 billion yen ($2.2 billion) in 2007 to about 10 billion yen ($110 million) in 2008. Across the company, sales were down 25 percent, but electronics and games sales were especially hard hit. Sales of games, including the company's popular PlayStation series, fell 32 percent over the year. Sales of electronics decreased by nearly 30 percent. The appreciation of the yen also cut into profits. A stronger yen makes Japanese products more expensive or forces companies to lower their profit margins to keep prices the same. Last week, Sony warned that it will close out the fiscal year, which ends March 31, with an operating loss of 260 billion yen ($2.9 billion), its first in 14 years.

"Washington (CNN) -- Iran has freed an Iranian-American detained for more than two years, his lawyer said Saturday. Reza Taghavi, a retired businessman from Orange County, California, was released at 4 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET) on Saturday, after being held in Iran's notorious Evin prison since his arrest in May 2008 on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group, the lawyer said. Los Angeles-based attorney Pierre-Richard Prosper said Taghavi has been reunited with his family and is hoping to return to the United States next week. ""It's obviously a happy day, a great day for the Taghavi family,"" Prosper said by phone from Tehran. A report on Iran's state-run Press TV showed Taghavi alternately smiling and weeping after his release. Prosper has been negotiating Taghavi's release since September 2009. Saturday's release was the product of three trips to Iran, meetings with Iranian officials in New York and Europe and close to 300 e-mails with Iranian officials, he said. On Saturday he held a final round of negotiations with Iranian authorities, who he said ""persuaded the judge to release him today."" Taghavi, 71, traveled frequently to Iran to visit family and friends without incident, according to Prosper. In April 2008, Taghavi went to Tehran with his wife. Before he left, he was asked by an acquaintance in Los Angeles named Imran Afar to take $200 for a friend in Tehran ""who was down on his luck,""  Prosper said. Los Angeles has a large Persian community. Taghavi did not know the individual to whom he was asked to deliver the money, Prosper said. He handed it over and two weeks later was detained by Iranian authorities, after the recipient of the money was arrested on charges of association with an anti-regime group called Tondar. Prosper said Afar provided him with information he shared with the Iranian government that proved that Taghavi was not part of Tondar, which seeks to restore the monarchy in Iran. The group claimed responsibility for the April 12, 2008, bombing of the Hosseynieh Seyed al-Shohada mosque in the city of Shiraz. ""This is the product of fourteen months of non-stop negotiations with the Iranian government and authorities,"" Prosper said Saturday. ""They finally got to the point where they realized he was used by this organization and he does not pose a threat to them."" Prosper said Taghavi's case has thus far been ""suspended,"" but that he hopes after working out ""some final details"" with Iranian authorities the case will be dismissed outright. Although Taghavi continues to maintain his innocence, Prosper said a condition of his release was that he travel to Shiraz before leaving the country to visit the sight of the mosque bombing and to meet with a survivors group. Taghavi also agreed to share the story of the circumstances of how he was taken advantage of by Tondar. ""He is more than happy to that, as he feels aggrieved"" by the group, Prosper said. Taghavi has been reunited with his wife, who has been in Tehran since July, and with his brother, who lives in the country. He has spoken to his son and daughter in California, Prosper said. Taghavi's brother posted the deed to his home as collateral for his eventual release. Prosper said that returning the deed is among the ""final paperwork"" he hopes to resolve later this week to arrange for Taghavi to leave the country. ""The most important thing is we get him on a plane,"" Prosper said. The family has said it would not speak about his release until Taghavi returns safely home. Taghavi's is a rag-to-riches story, his 36-year-old daughter, Leila Taghavi, told CNN in March. He brought his family to the United States in 1979, before the Iranian Revolution, and stayed on in California to keep his family safe. Leila Taghavi said her father taught himself English, started a video game company in his garage and grew it into a successful corporation, which he handed over to his son when he retired 10 years ago. ""His life was the American dream,"" Leila said. ""He learned everything the hard way, sacrificed for his children and taught us to be grateful for the good things. He is wonderful, honest and generous, the kind of father every daughter would want."" The family was silent for more than a year about his arrest, fearful that speaking out would politicize the case in Tehran and Washington. ""It was blind faith, really,"" Leila said, explaining the silence. ""Not knowing it would take this long, and fear of the system. There was never a doubt of his innocence."" In September 2009, with no movement on the case and losing hope he would be released, the family hired Prosper to contact the State Department and initiate a dialogue with the Iranian government. The United States and Iran do not have formal relations, and Switzerland serves as the ""protecting power"" for the U.S. in Tehran. Prosper, who served as the ambassador-at-large for war crimes under the Bush administration and as a prosecutor for the Rwanda tribunal at the Hague, said he kept the State Department informed about the case, but did not ask for U.S. intervention out of fear Taghavi would become a political pawn by Iran in its standoff with the United States over Tehran's nuclear program. ""It was a conscious decision not to engage them in the effort,"" he said. He added that political upheaval in Iran after 2009's disputed presidential election and the government's subsequent violent crackdown on demonstrators had complicated his efforts. Prosper said he had not yet notified the U.S. about Taghavi's release, but would be working through the Swiss to get his client a U.S. passport to travel home. He described his client as ""surprisingly upbeat"" but emotional and physically tired. Taghavi suffers from diabetes and Prosper said his health deteriorated in prison. ""It's too early to say what his emotional and physical state is,"" Prosper said. ""There is going to be an adjustment period."" Other Americans remain in prison in Iran. American hikers Josh Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd were detained in Iran on July 31, 2009. According to their families, they accidentally strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while on a hiking trip in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Shourd was released last month, while Bauer and Fattal are still being held on espionage charges. Kian Tajbakhsh, an Iranian-American scholar who spent four months in jail in 2007, was arrested in July after the disputed presidential election and sentenced to 15 years in jail for spying. An appeals court later reduced his sentence to five years. The United States has no information about Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran almost three years ago.","Retired businessman Reza Taghavi is released Saturday, his lawyer says .

"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- They were roaming the halls of South Philadelphia High School looking for a fight. Their target, according to police: Asian students. By the end of the school day, as many as 30 students of Asian descent had been physically attacked and many were sent to the hospital for treatment, according to school and law enforcement officials. Wei Chen, who was a senior at the time, remembers December 3, 2009, like it was yesterday. ""They were sitting along the wall,"" he recalled. ""I saw the one student, his whole T-shirt [was bloody] because his nose is broken."" Wei was not injured in last year's melee, but he said the violence was racial tension between black and Asian immigrant students reaching its breaking point. After being attacked as a freshman and witnessing other attacks on Asian students, Wei founded the Chinese Student Association to help new Chinese students -- many who recently immigrated to the country -- adjust to life at South Philly High. He also kept track of the incidents of violence against Asian students. Last year's altercation was the final straw. Wei and 50 other students organized an eight-day boycott of the school. They wanted to draw attention to what they felt was an inadequate response by the school staff to the ongoing harassment and violence leading up to the December 3 incident. ""School should be safe,"" he said. ""The school should be responsible for students' safety. This is important."" Bach Tong, a native of Vietnam, was one of the students who participated in the boycott. He said standing up for what he believed in helped him find his voice. ""You know, I see not everyone speak up, so I need to stand up for myself 'cause I see myself in there, I see trouble in there,"" said Tong, who was a sophomore at the time of the incident. ""I cannot be selfish and stay aside to watch other people fixing stuff for me. I mean, I need to stand up and [fix] stuff for myself."" During those eight days, Wei, Tong and the other students met in Philadelphia's Chinatown neighborhood during school hours, doing their schoolwork, holding rallies, and talking about ways to deal with violence at the school. Despite taking a stand, Tong transferred out of South Philly High a year later, fearing for his safety and concerned about his education. Nevertheless, the boycott helped trigger nationwide attention to the violence against Asian students at South Philly High. Months later, a federal investigation was launched following a formal civil rights complaint filed by the Asian American Legal Defense Fund. ""It's huge,"" said Cecilia Chen, staff attorney for the Asian American Legal Defense Fund. ""It's basically the federal government coming in and saying that the school district has failed to protect the constitutional rights of its students, which they have an obligation to do,"" Chen said. According to the complaint, ""the District and the School acted with 'deliberate indifference' to the harassment against Asian students and 'intentional disregard for the welfare of Asian students'"" at the school. The Justice Department, which announced its investigation in August, has instructed the school system to improve the treatment of Asian students. And today, the perception among students and their families is that things are slowly changing. The school's principal resigned in May, security has been increased, and the school district has said there have been fewer reports of student assaults. The superintendent of schools did not return CNN's calls for a comment, but the school's new principal, Otis Hackney, says security at South Philly High is his top priority. ""There is no room for bullying at school,"" Hackney said in a recent phone interview. ""As principal, my No. 1 priority is to make sure my building is safe."" Hackney is the fifth principal in six years at South Philly High. A West Philadelphia native, Hackney wants his school off the state's ""persistently dangerous"" list, as well as meeting the Adequate Yearly Progress requirements, something his school has not achieved, he said. Hackney used education ""to change his situation,"" he said. ""I care because I was built this way,"" he said. ""I just truly see education as the way."" Next month, South Philly High students will launch a campaign for nonviolent schools with the help of the city's youth-led Philadelphia Student Union. The campaign seeks to improve school climate and enhance the trust between students and staff. Student Union member Shania Morris was in the eighth grade when last December's violence erupted at South Philly. Moved by the boycott, she wanted to make a difference in schools. ""We just want to fight to make a change in our schools so that they're nonviolent,"" said Morris, now a high school freshman. ""What we believe is that nonviolence is power that helps people rather than hurts."" While things have improved, it is a bittersweet accomplishment, says advocate Helen Gym, a board member for Asian Americans United. ""For all the wonderful students that we've worked with who stood up around the issue, we've lost dozens more,"" said Gym, who helped many Asian students document their experiences. ""Kids who just dropped out, kids who just gave up, kids who are lost. You know this is some small consolation, but ... we lost a generation of kids."" But for Wei Chen, who now attends Community College of Philadelphia, speaking out helped him find his inner strength. ""We have the power to change; we can do something,"" he said. ""It's not only adults who can do something, we can do something. I trust this.""","Last December, as many as 30 Asian students were attacked at South Philly High .

"(RollingStone.com) -- John Lennon would be turning 70 years old on October 9. At first, Yoko Ono herself didn't realize the significance of that date. ""I don't think about age so much,"" she tells ""Rolling Stone"". ""But I was getting messages from all corners of the world: 'We're celebrating John's birthday as a tribute to him.' I said, 'What is going on here?' It seems like with 70, there's an explosion [of sentiment]."" Over the next two months, Lennon's birthday will be commemorated with tribute concerts, reissues, a new documentary, the annual lighting of Ono's Imagine Peace light tower, even an Ono-Lady Gaga summit. Why is all this happening now? ""The reason has to do with the social climate, with wanting some of John's energy, power and conviction,"" says Ono. Here are some of the highlights. Documentary on the New York Years . ""LENNONYC,"" which premiered at the New York Film Festival September 25 and will debut on PBS November 22, focuses exclusively on the last decade of Lennon's life, from the time he and Ono moved to New York in 1971 until his death in 1980. ""New York offered him a chance to disconnect from the shackles of the Beatles,"" says director Michael Epstein. ""It allowed him to be John Lennon and not Beatle John. It offered simple freedoms, like going to Burger King and buying a Whopper, which he liked to do."" The film explores Lennon's immersion in the city's downtown arts scene and his raucous rock & roll work with Elephant's Memory, as well as the depression that followed the critical drubbing of his ""Some Time in New York City"" album and 1972 Madison Square Garden concert (which is seen here in newly restored footage). It also covers his ""lost weekend"" in Los Angeles, reconciliation with Ono and the creation of ""Double Fantasy"". Epstein says Ono had to stop and start several times while talking about Lennon's death, but she gave her blessing to the film nonetheless. ""It's 'Gimme Some Truth,' as John put it, so it's fine,"" Ono says. ""Let it all hang out there."" Photos: John & Yoko: A New York love story . Ono, Gaga, and Others to Play Los Angeles . On October 1 and 2, Ono will revive the Plastic Ono Band, the avant-garde outfit she and Lennon started in 1969, at the Orpheum Theater in L.A. Joining her for renditions of classic POB material will be Iggy Pop, Perry Farrell, Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, and Lady Gaga -- who signed up after recently meeting Sean Lennon in Japan. ""Lady Gaga and I speak the same language,"" Ono says. ""I respect her. I saw her show, and it was incredible. Everyone was mesmerized. John would've loved it. He's like me -- he went for wild things. And she's wild."" ""John Lennon Signature Box"" As with last year's Beatle reissues, Lennon's solo catalog -- ""Plastic Ono Band,"" ""Imagine,"" ""Sometime in New York City,"" ""Mind Games,"" and ""Walls and Bridges,""along with two albums with Yoko Ono, ""Double Fantasy"" and ""Milk and Honey"" -- has been remastered, and will be re-released on October 5. Ono was heavily involved, according to Paul Hicks, a former Abbey Road engineer who worked on the project: ""She knows everything about the songs, and she knows exactly how John's vocals should sound."" For Ono, though, the experience was unexpectedly difficult. ""I thought it was going to be fine --listening to John's songs has been a routine thing for me for the last 30 years,"" she says. ""But this time, maybe because I listened to all of them, it was very hard, emotionally hard. 'I'm Losing You' -- that really hit me."" ""Double Fantasy"" will also be packaged with a special ""Stripped Down"" edition, featuring bare-boned versions of the original tracks. ""John's voice is right up there, and it's so beautiful,"" Ono says. ""His diction was very unique. It's like listening to a Shakespearean actor. It choked me up. I wanted to tell him but he wasn't here, and that really upset me."" For fans, a box set, ""Gimme Some Truth"", will be particularly enticing; a bonus disc includes previously unreleased home recordings of songs from 1970's volcanic ""Plastic Ono Band"" (""God,"" ""I Found Out,"" ""Mother,"" ""Love"") along with other tracks from his subsequent records. Top ten Beatles songs of all time . ""Nowhere Boy film"" This independently-made U.K. movie takes an unexpected focus: It's a biopic concerned solely with Lennon's teenage years in Liverpool. The film, which is based on a memoir by Lennon's half sister Julia, hinges on the relationship between the future Beatle; his guardian, Aunt Mimi; and his free-spirited mother, Julia, who abandoned Lennon at four and then reappeared when he was 15. ""It's a love triangle that happens to be about John Lennon,"" says director Sam Taylor-Wood. ""There were two strong women then -- and that [dynamic] played out throughout his life."" Ono's Iceland Celebrations . On October 9, Ono will preside over the annual lighting of the Imagine Peace Tower -- 15 searchlights pointed skyward -- on an island off ReykjavÌk, Iceland. She'll also present LennonOno Grant for Peace awards to four recipients -- authors Michael Pollan and Alice Walker, public health advocate Barbara Kowalcyk, and documentary filmmaker Josh Fox -- whose work is ""based on their courage and commitment to peace, truth, and human rights."" To cap it off, she'll give a special Plastic Ono Band performance with a lineup that will include her son Sean along with Cornelius, Yuka Honda, and other members of the current POB. The show will be dedicated to Lennon, who once asked Ono to turn her conceptual idea for a light tower (from her book ""Grapefruit"") into an actual sculpture. ""John invited me over and said, 'I want this in my backyard,'"" she recalls. ""And I said, 'This is just an idea.' But for him, it was real. He was the first person who picked up on that concept."" Rockers Cover Lennon in Concert . Jackson Browne, Patti Smith, Cyndi Lauper, Aimee Mann, and Shelby Lynne will be among the musicians participating in a Lennon tribute concert on November 12 at New York's Beacon Theatre. The proceeds will benefit the Playing for Change Foundation, which brings music education programs to impoverished communities around the world.

"(CNN) -- Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre will meet this week with an NFL official as part of the league's investigation into allegations that he sent sexually explicit messages to women, an NFL spokesman said Monday. ""It's no secret,"" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said. ""Any time you review a matter like this, you're going to talk to the person involved. What we've said is, 'Yes, we will be interviewing him as part of the process.' "" Aiello said the meeting with Favre would not include Commissioner Roger Goodell, but the spokesman would not divulge with whom or where the meeting was to take place. ""We don't generally provide these kind of details,"" Aiello said. Asked Sunday what he expects to come out of the meeting, Favre said, ""I don't expect anything. As I said last week, during the week, tonight, I'm concerned about the next game. I'll let that take its course."" Sunday's news conference came after Favre led the Vikings to a 24-21 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, going 14 for 18 with 119 yards, one touchdown and one turnover. The claims were first published by the sports website Deadspin.com, which has posted nude pictures, text and voice messages it alleges he sent to a model and former television host who worked for the New York Jets in 2008. The Jets have given National Football League officials all the information they have regarding the incident, a team spokesman said last week. Jesse Derris, a spokesman for the Jets, told HLN's ""Prime News"" that the team has no role in the allegations against Favre, who played one season in New York and now plays for the Minnesota Vikings. Favre, who has been married for 14 years, has had no public comment on the allegations. He signed with the Minnesota Vikings in August 2009 after emerging from retirement for the second time in as many years. Deadspin first reported in August that Favre sent text messages, left voice mails and sent pictures of himself naked from the waist down to Jenn Sterger, who worked as a sideline personality and host for the Jets at the time. It also published what it said were excerpts from the messages. Afterward, Deadspin reported that a second woman had come forward to allege that she had received other lewd messages from the quarterback and that a third woman, whom the site did not identify, had received similar messages. The site reported the two women were massage therapists hired by the Jets and identified them only by pseudonyms. Derris said the therapists were hired for two days in the team's 2008 training camp and would not confirm whether they had any direct contact with Favre. CNN could not independently confirm whether the voice in the recordings belongs to Favre or whether he sent the notes. Sterger's representatives have declined comment. A.J. Daulerio, Deadspin's editor-in-chief and author of the Favre stories, told CNN last week that no one from the NFL has contacted him about an investigation into Favre. He acknowledged that third-party sources were paid for the story about Sterger and that he could not say definitively that the messages or photos the site posted came from the 41-year-old quarterback. Favre played most of his career with the Green Bay Packers, leading the team to a Super Bowl title in 1997. He was traded to the Jets after the 2007 season.","Vikings quarterback to meet with NFL official over conduct investigation .

"(CNN) -- Visitors to the Tate Modern gallery in London on Friday have been stopped from walking on a porcelain sunflower seed art installation by the maverick Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Members of the public had previously been encouraged to interact with the installation by walking among and handling the 100 million hand-crafted porcelain seeds. But Tate officials now say that walking on the artificial seeds, which lay in an inch-thick carpet in the gallery's massive Turbine Hall, has generated more dust than expected. ""Although porcelain is very robust, the enthusiastic interaction of visitors has resulted in a greater than expected level of dust in the Turbine Hall. Tate has been advised that this dust could be damaging to health following repeated inhalation over a long period of time. ""In consequence, Tate, in consultation with the artist, has decided not to allow visitors to walk across the sculpture,"" the statement by Tate Modern said. The installation is still open to the public, who can view the replica seeds from a first floor platform. A spokesman for Tate Modern told CNN that the public are unlikely be allowed to interact with the exhibit again. This is not the first time the gallery has experienced problems with an exhibit in the Turbine Hall. In 2006 the Tate had to hand out cloth sacks to visitors for an exhibition that consisted of metal slides by the artist Carsten Höller. Officials were worried that members of the public could experience burns on the slides. And in 2007 the gallery had to put up warning signs for a sculpture by Doris Salcedo called Shibboleth -- a huge artificial crack in the floor of the Turbine Hall. The sculpture by Ai -- described by some as China's ""Andy Warhol"" -- is the 11th commission in the internationally acclaimed Unilever Series at the gallery, an annual series kicked off in 2000 by Louise Bourgeois's spiders and mirrors. Ai's seeds are porcelain, each one individually handcrafted by laborers in the Chinese city of Jingdezhen. Each tiny piece has been individually molded and hand-painted, according to the gallery. Sunflower seeds are a popular Chinese street snack and one of the country's most famous exports, according to the gallery. But they hold greater significance for Ai, who spent his childhood in Xinjiang as the son of a celebrated poet exiled by the Chinese communist government during the Cultural Revolution. He told CNN: ""It was very poor and rural there, we had nothing else to enjoy. Sunflower seeds were something basic that everyone could have. Every holiday, wedding or even just going to the movies, we would all share sunflower seeds with one another. I think it's a very common, very inconspicuous object, but it also has a special relationship to our daily lives ... Of course, during the cultural revolution we all knew that the Sun symbolized the leader, and sunflowers represented the people. So I think these seeds carry multiple meanings."" Ai is a well-known and controversial figure in China, probably best-known today for the design -- in collaboration with Herzog & de Meuron -- of Beijing's ""Bird's Nest"" stadium, built for the 2008 Olympics. Shortly after, Ai -- who is one of China's leading social activists and bloggers -- distanced himself from the Olympics calling for a boycott and saying the Chinese government was using them as propaganda. In the 1990s, Ai came to international attention when he helped establish the avant-garde East Village in Beijing where a group of artists took up residence in impoverished migrant workers housing on the city's outskirts. It became a Mecca for radical Chinese contemporary artists like Ma Liuming. Other notable large-scale artworks that have filled the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall include Carsten Hollers' slides which had visitors shouting with excitement as they slid down; Olafur Eliasson's giant projection of the sun in ""The Weather Project"" and a huge crack in the floor courtesy of Doris Salcedo's ""Shibboleth."" CNN's Eileen Hsieh contributed to this story.","Visitors stopped from walking on carpet of seeds .

"(CNN) -- Lori Hyde was hunting for a unique vacation experience when her curiosity was piqued by Pretty Joe Rock, a tiny speck of land in the waters off Marathon in the Florida Keys with just enough room for a two-bedroom home and a few clusters of mangroves. She and her husband spent a week on the petite island in February, relaxing and enjoying each other's company, with no one else around but the resident birds. ""I was looking for a rental that would be private so that came up as I was searching around and we were like, well it can't get much more private than that,"" said Hyde, 43, a stay-at-home mom who lives in Woodbridge, Virginia. ""It's not an exclusive sort of thing. We're just ordinary people who just did something cool."" Indeed, the idea of renting a private island usually conjures up images of multimillionaires spending a fortune to jet off to a tropical paradise in the Caribbean or the South Pacific. If you have a lot of money to shell out, the possibilities are endless. But while a big budget will give you more options and luxurious accommodations, you don't have to be rich to rent your own island for a vacation. It can sometimes take as little as a few hundred dollars a week, a sense of adventure and the willingness to look at locations closer to home. The island mystique . Pretty Joe Rock, for example, can be yours for under $3,000 a week, which includes the use of a boat to get you to and from the island. Owner Bob Rainek said he gets a broad spectrum of renters, from blue collar to white collar; from families with kids to couples. ""It's almost a universal thing that people have this romantic kind of feeling for islands,"" Rainek said. ""It's a mystique to be on your own private island, to have water 360 degrees [around you.] It's a primal type emotion, as I look at it."" Business has been brisk despite the economy, partly because people who might otherwise go to Mexico for a vacation have been scared off by that country's drug-related violence and are looking for something exotic closer to home, Rainek said. He was proud to tout the Florida Keys, which he called ""America's Caribbean,"" as an alternative. Some of the most popular places to rent islands may surprise you. They include the northern United States and Canada, said Chris Krolow, the CEO of Private Islands Inc., a company based in Toronto, Ontario, that has about 200 islands for rent all over the world in its database. Clients come from all walks of life, spending as little as $550 for a week on Republic Island in Michigan (which comes with a log cabin) or more than $66,000 for a week on The Rania Experience in the Maldives (which comes with three villas, a private chef, a yacht and other ultra-luxurious touches.) 'Robinson Crusoe' experience . For something in between, a budget of several thousand dollars a week is usually a good start. ""We're even finding more and more people who are saving and planning a honeymoon on an island. It's a little bit more expensive than what they had originally planned but it seems to be a growing trend,"" Krolow said. ""It's probably the most romantic experience that you could ever imagine just being on this tiny island with the person that you just married."" You can choose a self-catering island, which gives you the use of a home but requires you to bring your own food and make your own meals (the less expensive option), or a full-service island that comes with a staff, according to Vladi Private Islands, a company based in Hamburg, Germany. Its database of about 150 islands for rent includes everything from Île de Chantemesle near Paris, France, to Forsyth Island, New Zealand. Some people seek the thrill of being dropped off in a remote place that's completely undeveloped. On ""Robinson Crusoe"" islands, you are left to your own devices, make your own meals, bring a tent or hammock and anything else you may need, the company said. Nova Scotia, Canada, is one part of the world that offers such opportunities, added Sabine Rollinger, a Vladi spokeswoman. Krolow recalled a CEO who last year spent 10 days on a deserted spot in the Marshall Islands bonding with his 13-year-old son. ""It's pretty much the closest you'll get to being stranded on your own private island,"" Krolow said. Spending a lot or a little . On the other end of the spectrum, there's Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson's 74-acre paradise in the British Virgin Islands complete with luxurious accommodations and a large staff. It's all yours for at least $53,000 a night for up to 28 guests, though you can rent individual rooms for a fraction of that price during a select few ""Celebration Weeks."" YouTube: See what $53,000 a day gets you on Necker Island . It may sound like the ultimate getaway, but people who are looking for that private island feel might be a little disappointed by such a huge resort, Krolow said. And if the idea of having an island all too yourself is too expensive or intimidating, you can try one with a single lodge or hotel perched on top, like the quaint five-room bed-and-breakfast on East Brother Light Station near San Francisco, California. Starting at about $300 a night, it's an island stay that's both private and not too hard on the wallet. Whatever your budget, an island may be waiting.","Many islands can be rented for a few thousand dollars a week .
If you have a sense of adventure, some can be had for a few hundred dollars .

"(CNN)  -- India's women claimed an historic gold medal in the 4x400m relay at the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi on Tuesday, as women's 100m champion Osayemi Oludamola was officially stripped of her title. A packed Jawarhalal Nehru Stadium witnessed India's women collect their first-ever track gold, shocking race favorites Nigeria and England in the process. But India's joy was tempered by the confirmation that Nigerian Oludamola was formally disqualified after testing positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine. That decision resulted in Natasha Mayers of St Vincent and The Grenadines,  who herself served a two-year drug ban from 2005,  being promoted to the gold medal position with England's Kathryn Endacott taking silver and Bertille Atangana of Cameroon awarded the bronze. And Nigeria were hit with more doping controversy on Tuesday when 24-year-old Oludamola's teammate, Samuel Okon, also tested positive for the same substance following his sixth position in the men's 110m hurdles. Elsewhere on the track, Kenya completed their domination of the distance races with world champion Vivian Cheruiyot winning the women's 5,000m and Silas Kiplagat taking the men's 1,500m. Those results meant Kenya won eight out of the 10 races over 800m with Ugandan Moses Kipsiro taking the other two -- the men's 5,000m and 10,000m. England won the men's 4x100m relay gold medal ahead of Jamaica, with India claiming bronze, while England's women also secured sprint relay gold, with Ghana and India completing the podium. And Australia won the final track event, the men's 4x400m relay, ahead of Kenya and England. In the other field events, Nigeria's Tosin Oke leapt 17.16m to win the men's triple jump while Australia won the men's javelin (Jarrod Bannister) and women's pole vault (Alana Boyd). On a great day for India, the hosts also defeated England 5-4 on penalties to reach the men's hockey final for the first time in their history, after they had fought back from 3-1 down to draw 3-3. India are now through to meet three-time winners Australia in the final on Thursday. New Zealand won a record fourth consecutive gold in rugby sevens, defeating rivals Australia 24-17 in a tight final. South Africa beat England 17-14 in the bronze medal match. Meanwhile, Canadian diver Alexandre Despatie won his third gold of the Games, and ninth of his career, after he and compatriot Reuben Ross won the men's 3m springboard synchro title. The current medals table sees Australia well clear on 68 golds, with India on 32 and England back in third place on 30.","India's women made Commonwealth history in the 4x400m relay in New Delhi .

"(CNN) -- Denver Broncos wide receiver Kenny McKinley was found dead Monday afternoon in a Colorado home. Authorities said it appeared McKinley died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was 23. ""Deputies discovered a male in the second-floor master bedroom of the home and determined that male was deceased,"" the Arapahoe County sheriff's department said in a statement. ""Although the death of Mr. McKinley appears to be the result of a self-inflicted gunshot, the investigation into this matter ... is ongoing."" Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels will speak to the media Tuesday about McKinley's death. McKinley was selected by the Broncos in the fifth round (141st overall) of the 2009 NFL draft from the University of South Carolina, where he set the school records for receptions. He attended South Cobb High School in Austell, Georgia. He played in eight games with the Broncos as a rookie, but was placed on injured reserve before the start of the 2010 season after suffering a knee injury, according to the team. ""Everyone with the Broncos is shocked and saddened by the loss of Kenny McKinley,"" Broncos President and CEO Pat Bowlen said in a statement on the Broncos' website. ""He was part of the Broncos family and will be greatly missed by our organization. My most heartfelt condolences go out to Kenny's family and friends.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli Cabinet has approved an amendment to a citizenship law that requires new citizens to declare their loyalty to a ""Jewish and democratic state,"" the prime minister's office said Sunday. A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed vote, saying 22 ministers voted for the change and eight voted against it. Now that the proposal has passed the Cabinet, it will be taken up by Israel's parliament, the Knesset, for passage into law. Before his government's weekly Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu made a forceful plea Sunday for changing the nation's Citizenship Law. He challenged criticism that the revision is undemocratic and could harm relations with the minority Arab population. Netanyahu cited the nation's Declaration of Independence, which says Israel is both the ""national state of the Jewish people"" and a democratic state ""in which all its citizens -- Jewish and non-Jewish -- enjoy fully equal rights."" ""Democracy is the soul of Israel and we cannot do without it,"" Netanyahu said, according to a statement from his media adviser. He noted that Israel was the only democracy in the Middle East, and that ""there is no other Jewish state in the world."" ""The combination of these two lofty values expresses the foundation of our national life and anyone who would like to join us needs to recognize this,"" Netanyahu said. Netanyahu announced last week he would push now for adding language to Israel's citizenship and entry law that would declare a new citizen's allegiance to ""a Jewish and democratic state."" After the prime minister announced the push, but before Sunday's Cabinet vote, Arab Knesset member Hanin Zoabi said that Israel is ""discriminative in its policies and laws against all who are not Zionists.""  Zoabi went on to say the law ""not only discriminates between Jews and non Jews, it also discriminates between Zionist Jews and non Zionists Jews."" Another Arab Knesset member Ahmed Tibi, from the Ra'am-Ta'al party, criticized the move as well, saying that ""the values of Jewish and Democratic cannot be in the same definition because democracy is the equality of all the citizens."" ""But an ethnic definition as Jewish is the preference of the Jew over that of the Arab and therefore it fixates an inferior status to 20 percent of the population,"" Tibi said. Israel is home to roughly 6 million Jewish citizens and 1.5 million Arab citizens. In describing the reasons for the timing of the proposed change of language, Mark Regev, a spokesman for Netanyahu, said, ""What we are asking others to accept we have to demand of ourselves"" -- a reference to the recent Israeli government demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. The language of the new oath would not apply to immigrants coming to Israel under what is called the ""Law of Return"" that allows converted Jews and people with Jewish ancestry the right to settle in Israel and acquire citizenship. Israel's right-wing coalition government is divided over the proposal. Minister of Social Affairs Yitzhak Herzog from the Labour Party, which questions the change, told Israeli Army radio that political pressure was behind Netanyahu's push for the move. The problem with the amendment, Herzog said, ""is not in the essence but the influence this will have on the dialogue with the Arab minority in Israel."" Recently resumed peace talks with the Palestinian leadership appear to hinge on whether Israel will extend a moratorium on construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The moratorium expired on September 26. The right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, also a member of the coalition government, welcomed the proposed change and denied it had anything to do with a possible extension of the settlement freeze. ""It is definitely not connected to the settlement freeze,"" said David Rotem, a Knesset member for the party. ""We have been talking about passing this law even before the elections and it is part of our coalition agreement."" Before the changes were approved by the Cabinet, Rotem told CNN the oath was ""very similar to the citizenship law in the United States, England, Australia, France and many other countries who all demand a declaration of loyalty."" CNN's Shira Medding, Michal Zippori, Kevin Flower and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","Israeli Cabinet approves changes to citizenship law .

"(InStyle.com) -- When ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" premiered on September 19, 1970, it was almost revolutionary: the first television series focused on an independent (read: unmarried) career girl. And Mary's wardrobe was a little bit revolutionary too -- working women across the country were quick to copy her colorful dresses and wide-legged pantsuits. To celebrate the iconic program's fortieth anniversary, InStyle takes a look back at five fashionable TV shows -- and characters -- that have influenced women's at-work style. ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' Mary Richards lived in wintry Minneapolis and therefore had no shortage of cute cold-weather staples, including double-breasted coats, knee-high boots, and that famous blue tam. But it was her 70s work-wear that most women sought: colorful scarves, two-piece suits, and bright, office-appropriate dresses. See all 10 shows that influenced women's at-work wardrobes . ""Dynasty"" Okay, so the Carrington women weren't exactly your typical 9-to-5ers. Nevertheless, the big-shouldered, wasp-waisted creations worn by oil mogul Alexis (Joan Collins) and her longtime rival Krystle (Linda Evans) were popular enough with fans that the show spawned a signature fashion line, ""The Dynasty Collection"" which was designed by the show's costumer, Nolan Miller. ""Ally McBeal"" In 1998, shortly after the show's first season finale, Ally McBeal's disembodied head appeared on the cover of Time magazine along with the question, ""Is Feminism Dead?"" Despite the conclusions reached by that article (is it really fair to compare a fictional character to activists and thinkers like Susan B. Anthony and Gloria Steinem?), women do owe something to the flighty young lawyer played by Calista Flockhart: She almost singlehandedly made the workplace safe for bare legs, freeing us from the tyranny of mandatory pantyhose. InStyle.com: Fall's top trends for the office . ""Sex and the City"" The amount of money that Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), a freelance writer, spent on shoes was so improbable that it eventually became a plot point; her clothes only got more prohibitively expensive as the show went on. Still, ""Sex and the City""had an enormous impact on regular women's style: Aside from all of those quickly knocked off (and forgotten) nameplate necklaces and oversized faux corsages, the ladies' willingness to play with fashion inspired legions. InStyle.com: See Carrie Bradshaw's best looks ever . ""Mad Men"" It's set in the early 1960s, but the best ensembles on ""Mad Men"" for example, almost anything worn by Joan (Christina Hendricks) would look chic, virtually unaltered, in today's offices. In fact, the show has heavily influenced fashion in the four years it's been on the air. This fall's runways were dominated by richly colored dresses, circle skirts and camel coats, straight from the ""Mad Men"" era. InStyle.com: See Mad Men's mod season 4 style . Want more?

"Washington (CNN) -- Pop star Lady Gaga will headline a rally in Portland, Maine, on Monday calling on the state's two Republican senators to vote yes on taking up a defense bill that includes authorization to repeal the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy toward gay and lesbian servicemembers. A crucial Senate vote is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, and supporters of the repeal say that as of now, they do not have the 60 votes needed to overcome a GOP filibuster blocking the bill. Maine Republicans Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe are publicly undecided, and could each potentially provide Democrats the votes they need to bring the issue before the Senate. Lady Gaga's rally is being organized by Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN), a gay rights group mobilizing grassroots support to repeal the controversial policy. The organization also helped the singer set up a lengthy YouTube video posted Friday urging her fans to call their senators and ask them to support Tuesday's procedural vote. The singer sent word of the planned rally via twitter Sunday night. A spokesman for SLDN says Gaga will be accompanied at Monday's rally by both gay and straight military veterans. Both of Maine's GOP senators have been generally supportive of the gay rights community, and this issue in particular. Collins voted to authorize the Pentagon to repeal the don't-ask-don't-tell policy when the issue was before the Senate Armed Services Committee this summer, and SLDN executive director Aubrey Sarvis calls both Collins and Snowe ""key to breaking the filibuster"" on Tuesday. Republican leaders are trying to keep all 41 GOP senators on board to block the bill, arguing that Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, is unfairly limiting the amendments allowed to try to change the bill once it is on the Senate floor. GOP leaders are also ridiculing Reid for trying to bring what they call a purely political vote to the Senate floor right before the election, to appease the gay community, which has been frustrated with Democrats for inaction on this issue. On Friday, aides to both Collins and Snowe told CNN they were still undecided about how they would vote. GOP leadership sources told CNN they feel confident they can keep all their members in line and prevent the defense bill from coming to the Senate floor. Lady Gaga's rally will take place at 4 p.m. ET at Deering Oaks Park in Portland, Maine, near the University of Southern Maine campus.","Lawmakers need 60 votes to overcome GOP filibuster of the defense bill .

"(CNN) -- A Yemeni court Monday sentenced to death one of the leaders of the terrorist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen's state-run news agency reported. Prior to his capture, trial and sentencing, Saleh al-Shawsh had been one of the three most wanted members of the group, an arm of Osama bin Laden's broader terrorist organization formed last year. The Specialized Criminal Court in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa sentenced al-Shawsh after finding him guilty of killing Yemeni soldiers and attacking oil installations and security checkpoints in the province of Hadramout, reported Saba, the Middle Eastern nation's state-run news agency. Referring to al-Shawsh as a member of an ""armed gang,"" the report said that the incidents he was involved in occurred between 2007 and 2010. Yemen has become a main battleground for al Qaeda, with the government carrying out air strikes and a ground campaign against the group this weekend. President Barack Obama's counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, met the president of Yemen a month ago to discuss al Qaeda and U.S. support for Yemen, the U.S. Embassy announced at the time. Brennan delivered a letter to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh affirming U.S. support for Yemen, the embassy said. The Obama  administration is considering adding armed CIA drones to help fight the  increasing threat of al Qaeda in Yemen, a U.S. official said in August. A  U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN that the administration recognizes  that ""not enough is being done in Yemen"" to meet the growing challenge  posed by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Al Qaeda activity in Yemen grabbed the attention of the West with the Christmas Day attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines trans-Atlantic flight as it approached Detroit, Michigan. The suspect, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who has pleaded not guilty to six federal terrorism charges, was reportedly trained and armed in Yemen. Yemen has launched at least two offensives against the group since then, including one this weekend. ""Yemen's security forces have been in engaged in a ground and air campaign for two days in Abyan province against al Qaeda,"" a government official told CNN Sunday. CNN is not naming the official, who is not authorized to speak to the press about the campaign. The official said the battle is fierce and bloody and is part of a larger low-intensity conflict with al Qaeda in the region. The campaign follows ""an attempt by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to kill the governor and junior regional security officials this past week,"" the official said. At least six militants have been killed, the official said, as airstrikes -- which began Saturday and continued on Sunday -- targeted militant gatherings in the province's Lawdar and Moudeya districts. ""Western embassies in Sana'a were put on high security alert -- especially the British and American embassies,"" the official said, referring to Yemen's capital. ""The government of Yemen has increased security outside those embassies and they were heavily fortified in fears of AQAP retaliation."" Tribesmen from Abyan province are supporting the provincial governor after al Qaeda members killed his brother in an ambush aimed at assassinating the governor himself, the official said. Saturday night, two suicide bombers were killed after their vehicle, which was rigged with explosives, attempted to ram a military motorcade in Moudeya, the official said. The car exploded after Yemeni forces shot at the suspicious vehicle with high-caliber machine guns. On Friday, the Interior Ministry offered a reward of 20 million Yemeni riyal (about U.S. $100,000) for information leading to the capture of eight suspected members of al Qaeda in Yemen. The nation's official Saba news agency identified the eight, urging the public to cooperate and warning citizens not to shelter any of the suspects. And a wanted al Qaeda in Yemen member turned himself in to Saudi Arabian authorities on Friday, Saudi Arabia's official Saudi Press Agency reported, citing a security spokesman at the country's Ministry of Interior. The statement added that the man, Jaber bin Jibran bin Ali al-Afifi, a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, had rejoined al Qaeda in Yemen after he had returned from captivity. In the past week, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is suspected of being behind three separate attacks that have killed at least two Yemeni security officials, according to a government official. Last week also saw the release of an audio recording purported to be from Qassim al-Rimi (also known as Abu Hurira al-Sanaei), the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, that was posted on radical militant websites. The speaker promised that Yemen's President Saleh would be punished ""for his crimes"" and announced that a new army would rid the country of ""crusaders and apostates."" CNN could not verify the authenticity of the recording. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Saleh al-Shawsh was one of the most wanted militants in Yemen .

"(CNN) -- If you're part of the nearly 40 percent of Americans who are independent or centrist, it's easy to feel frustrated and politically homeless. As activists rally around the most polarizing figures in both parties, we need to play offense from the center and organize across party lines. To that end, I've compiled two lists of centrist candidates -- six Republicans and five Democrats -- in competitive elections this fall. Their success or failure will say a lot about the strength of the center after a season of RINO hunting and DINO hunting (that's ""Republican In Name Only"" and ""Democat in Name Only""), and it will indicate the chances of a constructive Congress in the year to come. You'll notice that each list reflects candidates running outside their party's geographic base -- Republicans in the Northeast and Pacific Coast, Democrats in the Mountain West and South. Neither group of candidates can afford to be captive to its party's special interests, and so it exerts its independence. These are the kind of candidates who keep the two-party system flourishing in states that otherwise would revert to one-party rule and reinforce regional red vs. blue stereotypes. They are also the kind of candidates our country is going to rely on, after the elections are over and it's actually time to govern. Government cannot be a warfare of interests, and neither party has a monopoly on good ideas or good people. We need to define the common ground that exists and then build on it. Hyper-partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from uniting to solve the serious challenges we face. And here's an open secret: The centrists in both parties often agree more on issues than they do with extreme members of their own party. Whether that ultimately results in a third party will be seen down the line, but I know that a centrist coalition will be essential in Congress to bridge close divides and to allow common-ground decisions. Two quick notes: I almost never used the word ""moderate,""  because it connotes a mushy middle that splits the difference on every issue. The word ""centrist"" better communicates the decisiveness, principle and sense of responsibility that I believe the position can contain. Second, I'm an independent rather than a Democrat or Republican, and later in the week, I'll publish a column looking at some of the independent candidates running this year. In the meantime, take in this list of stand-out centrist candidates from both parties and across the country in 2010. Republicans . Meg Whitman, California. Yes, this self-funded GOP nominee for governor has spent an unprecedented amount money to remain competitive as a Republican in the Golden State. She is in many ways a classic centrist: fiscally conservative but liberal on social issues and committed to the politics of problem solving. She's betting that her CEO experience at the head of eBay will help her in tough but inevitable negotiations with public sector unions and restore this great but troubled state to fiscal sanity. Mark Kirk, Illinois. He should be a GOP hero this election cycle: a Republican with a more than fighting chance to take President Obama's Senate seat. He's got fiscal conservative credentials as the first member of the House Appropriations Committee to renounce earmarks. He was a Naval Reservist. But he was opposed by Rush Limbaugh and other conservative opinion makers in the GOP primary largely because he is pro-choice and the co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group in the House. Nonetheless, he's running neck-and-neck to win in November, and if he wins, he will be a major player in the constructive center of the Senate for decades to come. Chris Dudley, Oregon. This former NBA star is giving former Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber a run for his money. Dudley can't convincingly be painted as a far-right zealot -- he's pro-choice and pro-environment as well as pushing a pro-business agenda. Oregon has a mail-in only ballot, so the election in this Pacific Northwest jewel is already well under way. Robert Ehrlich, Maryland.  He established a more than 60 percent approval rating as a Republican governor in Maryland (his lieutenant governor was Michael Steele) before the Democratic tidal wave of 2006 swept him out of office. Now, he's back in a rematch with the man who beat him, former Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley. He's been a businessman and a congressman, championing some of the toughest anti-crime and innovative environmental initiatives in the country. Nan Hayworth, New York.  She doesn't represent Carl Paladino's Republican Party, but she's a return to the NY GOP of Rudy Giuliani and George Pataki. This upstate doctor and small-businesswoman is pro-choice and is running for Congress against Democratic incumbent John Hall. It's a Republican-leaning swing district that went narrowly for George W. Bush in 2004 and Obama in 2008. Hayworth's running a few points up against Hall, but she'll have to get past the drag of Paladino at the top of her ticket. Charlie Bass, New Hampshire. The centrist standard-bearer lost his congressional seat in the Democratic sweep of 2006, and now he's aiming for a return. He had the guts to push for Tom DeLay's removal as party leader in 2005 after the scandals involving imprisoned lobbyist Jack Abramoff. He's been a charter member of Republican Majority for Choice, Republicans for Environmental Protection and a former director of the Republican Main Street Partnership. Democrats . John Hickenlooper, Colorado.  This popular mayor of Denver is narrowly leading in polls to take the helm of this center-right state as governor in a three-way race against immigration hardliner Tom Tancredo and GOP nominee Dan Maes. Hickenlooper, an entrepreneur and owner of a local microbrewery, got national attention this year for an ad featuring him taking a shower as a way of washing off all the ""mud"" from negative campaigns. Gabrielle Giffords, Arizona. This ""Blue Dog"" Democrat won Jim Kolbe's vacated congressional seat in 2006 and was re-elected in 2008 despite home-state hero John McCain running for president. She's pro-choice, pro-gun and pro-energy independence. Her husband is the only active-duty military spouse in Congress. Jack Spratt, South Carolina. This old-school budget hawk was one of the leaders of the 1990s budget compromises in Congress that brought the country from deficit to surplus under Clinton and Gingrich. He's facing a predictably tough House race in a red state like South Carolina this year, but the nation is going to need his experience to get out of its fiscal hole, given the likelihood of divided government again. He's been appointed to the bipartisan Deficit Reduction Commission, which is set to release its report in December. Blanche Lincoln, Arkansas. This centrist senator is facing the longest odds of anyone on this list in her re-election bid against Republican congressman John Boozman. Critics say she's alienated her base. Lincoln responds that her fight against the labor unions that pumped $1 million into a primary campaign to unseat her because of her opposition to bailouts and the public option shows her independence from party labels in a state that is increasingly conservative. Michael Bennet, Colorado. The nominee to replace Ken Salazar in the Senate was always a tough fit for Colorado -- a former investment banker turned superintendent of the Denver public school system. In this, his first campaign for public office, he's already fended off a well-financed primary challenge backed by labor unions from a former state legislative leader, who argued that Bennet hadn't been liberal enough in Washington. Now he's locked in a surprisingly tight race against Tea Party favorite Ken Buck, who was expected to be comfortably ahead at this stage of the campaign.

"(CNN) -- A Minnesota man who put up a website asking people to help him and his wife decide whether to have an abortion admitted Tuesday they never intended to terminate the pregnancy. Pete Arnold, who describes himself as a conservative/libertarian and has stirred controversy for his conservative posts on several websites, said he wanted to stimulate conversation about the politically charged subject. Arnold told CNN he bought the domain name ""birthornot.com"" before wife Alisha became pregnant about four months ago. He said he had been mulling the idea ""for some time,"" adding that his wife is pro-choice but agreed that abortion was not on the table for them. ""We chose our words very carefully,"" Arnold told CNN, insisting the site was not a hoax even though there were never any plans to accept the vote results if abortion won. ""A lot of people elect representatives based on this issue alone, yet nothing happens, nothing comes of it, nothing changes."" he said, adding that the couple called the baby ""Baby Wiggles"" to give people more to think about. ""My intent is not to deceive people, but at the same point, I do want people to talk about this. This seemed like a pretty good way to further the discussion, because people don't ever seem to want to talk about it for real if there's no name on it, no Baby Wiggles,"" he said. Media reports have identified Arnold as a regular commenter -- frequently anti-abortion -- on such websites as Gawker and the DailyKos, typically using the name ""Zeeboid,"" which is also the name on his vanity license plate. He also has a website by that name and a channel on YouTube, but both were offline Tuesday afternoon. He has also been a regular contributor to a Minnesota radio program called ""Race to the Right."" Last week, the Arnolds insisted that their website was legitimate and that they had no agenda. Arnold said the couple intended to end the vote December 7, two days before the last day Alisha Arnold could legally get an abortion, their blog says. But on Tuesday, Pete Arnold said, ""We're talking about ending it early. I think people are getting it."" Arnold said that the site has brought the couple about $225 through Google ads but that he's spent $500 on it. On Friday, Arnold had said that the site had made about $40 and that he'd spent $215.

"Washington (CNN) -- Hoping to quell growing concerns in Congress about enhanced security procedures for airline passengers, top administration officials who oversee airport security went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to explain the new methods and why they are needed. The closed, nearly two-hour briefing for congressional staff members included a detailed explanation of new advanced imaging technology that has sparked outrage from some passengers because it captures an image of their bodies through their clothing. Also, Transportation Security Administration officials demonstrated the invasive pat downs required for passengers who either refuse a full body scan or who need a follow-up inspection after an image is taken. ""I feel bad for the girl they put in front of 50 people when they were doing a pat down,"" said one Republican senate staff member about the female TSA employee who was part of the demonstration, reflecting the concerns of many passengers about being touched in their private areas by security agents. However, a Democratic staffer who was there said it was all very professional. ""I don't think there was an emotional reaction one way or another,"" the aide said. ""They explained -- based on what we know and what the threat is -- we think this is the best way to mitigate the risks."" Another aide, who refused to say if he was a Democrat or a Republican, said the briefing would help lawmakers ""understand the difference between a standard pat down and a more rigorous one."" A Department of Homeland Security undersecretary and two TSA assistant administrators conducted the briefing, the second of two such meetings on Capitol Hill this week. The security agency set up the briefings after being ""deluged"" by calls for more information from congressional offices, which were themselves getting questions from angry and confused constituents, according to an administration official who asked not to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak about the closed briefing. ""Folks are getting a lot of concern from the constituents and they just want to be able to answer phone calls that they get at their offices,"" said the official, who described the session as ""a very grown-up exchange of questions and answers."" One Democratic aide said the TSA's effort to boost security has become a public relations problem because images of the tough new procedures are disturbing to many people. ""It's always tough for the government to get their side of the story out compared to how quickly someone with YouTube video, Facebook, Twitter, all those things, can. For all the things they are trying to do to get the word out, one single isolated incident gets a lot more press than all the efforts they're trying to do,"" the aide said. Two GOP aides who spoke to CNN complained that despite the briefing being labeled by Transportation Security Administration as ""SSI"" -- containing ""security sensitive information"" -- staffers were not required to show identification when they arrived. They simply signed an attendance sheet that was passed around. ""They have no clue who was in there,"" one of the Republican aides said.","Session provides information for members of Congress to tell concerned constituents .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Drug Enforcement Agency wants people around the country to raid their medicine cabinets this week and get rid of any old or unused prescriptions that may still be lying around. But instead of throwing them in the toilet or trash can, the DEA wants people to bring them to one of more than 3,400 sites this Saturday for safe disposal. It's part of a campaign called National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day aimed at preventing increased pill abuse and theft. ""The National Prescription Drug Take-Back campaign will provide a safe way for Americans to dispose of their unwanted prescription drugs,"" DEA Acting Administrator Michele Leonhart said in a statement. ""This effort symbolizes DEA's commitment to halting the disturbing rise in addiction caused by their misuse and abuse."" Medicines in home cabinets are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse, the DEA says, adding that studies show a majority of abused prescription drugs are obtained from family, friends, and the home medicine cabinet. Many Americans also don't know how to dispose of their unused medicine away, the DEA says. Flushing it down the toilet and throwing it away are both potential safety and health hazards, it says. ""Prescription drug abuse is the nation's fastest-growing drug problem, and take-back events like this one are an indispensable tool for reducing the threat that the diversion and abuse of these drugs pose to public health,"" said Gil Kerlikowske, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. ""The federal, state, and local collaboration represented in this initiative is key in our national efforts to reduce pharmaceutical drug diversion and abuse."" The Take-Back Day event, which is free, takes place Saturday between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. People who want to get rid of their prescription medicines can log onto the DEA website to find their local drop-off sites.","Drug Enforcement Agency launches National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day .

"(CNN) -- For decades they have been showered with abuse from almost every corner of the football ground; from managers, players and fans alike. But it seems that Scottish referees have blown the whistle and decided that enough is enough. Next weekend officials from the Scottish Premier League (SPL) have voted to stage a walkout in protest at what they see as an unacceptable level of abuse they have received in recent months, abuse that they believe has threatened their safety. The Scottish Football Association (SFA) immediately vowed to avert the planned action with president George Peat calling the referees' decision ""a sad day for Scottish football."" He told reporters: ""We will do everything we possibly can to broker a deal before the weekend because it's obviously important that officials are on duty. ""We do not condone the strike but we must sympathize with the grievances of the referees. It's built up until they could take no more. ""The behavior of some people in recent weeks has tarnished the image of Scottish football. It has demeaned the game. The climate of inference, innuendo and conspiracy theories must stop."" There have also been reports of referees receiving death threats and being abused in the street by supporters. Last week, the Scottish National Party's sport spokesman, MP Pete Wishart, suggested SPL referees should be forced to declare which team they support, an idea backed by Celtic chairman John Reid. Celtic have been at the forefront of the debate, with Reid last week calling for the resignation of referee Dougie McDonald after a controversial incident during the club's 2-1 victory at Dundee United on October 17. McDonald reversed his decision to award Celtic a penalty after claiming his assistant Steve Craven had alerted him to the mistake. But McDonald later admitted that it was he alone who overturned the decision and was warned by the SFA as a result. Reid was quoted as saying: ""If the SFA had any sense of their own integrity, they should look at it again. His position is completely untenable. The SFA's position on this issue is also untenable."" At his press conference Peat called Reid's remarks ""unhelpful"" and insinuated Celtic's behavior over the past few weeks had contributed to the referees' decision to strike. Peat said he hoped the strike would be called off but admitted that the SFA would look at bringing officials in from other parts of the UK in a bid to ensure this weekend's matches go ahead.","Scotland's top referees vote to go on strike after their integrity is questioned by clubs .

"(CNN)  -- South African star Erne Els is in no mood to rest on his laurels after his ""big surprise"" at being inducted into World Golf's Hall of Fame. ""The Big Easy"" told CNN he was ""very honored"" to be picked at the relatively tender age of 40. He will be officially inducted next May in a ceremony at the Players Championship in Florida. But despite landing the ultimate lifetime achievement award, Els is still keen to add to his 62 global victories and wants to round off his season by coming out on top at this week's PGA Tour Championship at East Lake. Els earned his place in the top 30 qualifiers after successive victories at the WGC-Doral and Arnold Palmer Invitational tournaments, both held near to his Florida home. ""It's a huge week, player of the year honors are up for stakes and I maybe have an outside chance if I win here,"" he said. Els has claimed three major crowns, two at the U.S. Open and a British Open triumph, but he has not added to his tally in eight years, often running into the Tiger Woods juggernaut. He puts it down to a ""confidence thing"" but has a burning desire to win the U.S. Masters at Augusta, where he has twice been runner-up in 2000 and 2004. ""You can only speak to people around me. I really work hard at it and feel I  can still do it,"" he told CNN. ""Sometimes I have tried a bit too hard,  in the past I was more carefree and I'm trying to get back to that mode."" An Els victory at Augusta would certainly be massively popular with golf galleries, who have taken the smooth-swinging South African to their hearts over the years. His election at the first opportunity also underlined the affection with which he is held. Els received 66 per cent of the vote from a panel of journalists, golf dignitaries and Hall of Fame members, easily topping the poll.","Ernie Els elected into World Golf's Hall of Fame at first attempt .

"(CNN) -- It's a cottage industry lately. One week we led with CNN President Jon Klein being relieved of his duties. Another week it was Rick Sanchez getting the boot for his remarks about Jews. On Sunday, we'll look at NPR's decision to ax Juan Williams over remarks about Muslims that he made on Fox News. This is not shaping up as a left-right slugfest. While Fox has practically declared war on National Public Radio, many liberals from Salon editor Joan Walsh to CNN contributor Donna Brazile to Whoopi Goldberg of ""The View"" criticized the radio network for axing Williams. It didn't help that NPR chief executive Vivian Schiller suggested he was seeing a psychiatrist. She later apologized. I've known Juan since he was at The Washington Post, and his unpredictable views have a tendency to tick people off. He's an African-American who got roasted by the liberal black community for backing Clarence Thomas against Anita Hill's allegations. The decision to dump Williams, in my view, has as much to do with his Fox News connection as his admission that he gets nervous when he sees people in Muslim garb on his plane. I find those remarks unsettling, but do they constitute a firing offense? We'll tackle that question with the Chicago Tribune's Clarence Page, CBS's Chip Reid and commentator S.E. Cupp. We'll also discuss the latest tensions between Republican candidates and the press. I'll also have a wide-ranging conversation about politics and culture with New York Times columnist Frank Rich. Plus, how did Jon Stewart land President Obama as a guest, and is his upcoming Washington rally an appeal to moderation or sheer entertainment? Time magazine critic James Poniewozik will join that discussion. That's the lineup -- at least, if no one gets fired between now and Sunday morning.","Howard Kurtz is the host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" on Sundays .

"(CNN) -- Spain's Jose Manuel Lara claimed only the second European Tour title of his career with victory over Englishman David Lynn in a playoff at the end of the Austrian Open in Atzenbrugg. The 33-year-old, the winner of the 2007 Hong Kong Open, carded a best-of-the-day eight-under-par 64 to finish on 271 (-17), level with joint overnight leader Lynn -- who posted a 68 for his final 18 holes. The pair finished three strokes clear of Sweden's Alexander Noren, England's Danny Willet, who led with Lynn after the third round before falling away with a 71, and European Ryder Cup star Graeme McDowell (69). However, on the first extra hole, Lynn needed three shots to find the green and Lara was abe to putt out for a par to seal victory -- and secure his European Tour card for 2011 in the process. Lara had missed nine cuts in a row before his fourth-place finish at last week's KLM Dutch Open and he carried that form over into this week's event. ""I was expecting something good. I was hitting the ball really well last week,"" Lara told the official European Tour website after his win. ""I wanted to win this tournament and the way I played this week, in my best dreams, I never imagined that."" Lynn's runner-up performance ensured he kept up an impressive record of finishing inside the top 100 on the Race To Dubai for an 11th consecutive season. ""Second place is a good finish so I can take heart from that and I've played some great golf this week.

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- There have been several points in my career as a producer and camera operator where I've realized that I have one of the best jobs in the world. This usually occurs to me in remote and interesting places like South Africa or Denmark or something. I'd been on the Santa Clarita, California, set of ""Jackass 3D"" for about two hours, watching two gigantic cranes catapult a Port-O-Potty containing star Steve-O and gallons of fecal matter 10 stories in the air when the feeling struck me again. Admittedly, I'm a longtime fan of the ""Jackass"" franchise, which was born out of an article for Big Brother magazine in 1999. A friend showed me a clip of Johnny Knoxville getting shocked with a stun gun while hoisting an American flag, and I've been on board ever since. When I heard about the 3-D project, I have to admit I was worried. I was concerned that the Jackass concept was old and tired, and its stars -- Johnny, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Wee Man, Bam Margera, and Preston Lacy -- had run out of ideas. With nothing left in their creative arsenal, they wandered out of ""Avatar"" one afternoon and decided that they would jump on the 3-D bandwagon to cash in one last time. However, a few days on set showed me those concerns were unfounded. The Jackass joie de vivre was alive and well, and the addition of a third dimension only enhanced the jaw-dropping inexplicable hilarity of the crew's antics. See the rest of The Cast and Crew of Jackass 3D at VBS.TV . By mid-morning of my first day onset, Steve-O had been launched hundreds of feet in the air and the crew -- along with maybe $1 million worth of 3-D camera equipment -- had been coated with a fine spray of human and animal waste. Director Jeff Tremaine was screaming at a gagging camera operator to get b-roll shots of the poop-slicked interior of the Port-O-Potty that Steve-O had been strapped in moments before. Despite the smell and intermittent bouts of vomiting by the crew, I could tell that everyone on set knew they'd created something special. I went from having the feeling that I had one the best jobs in the world to being pretty sure the cast and crew from Jackass had it all figured out.","Using just handheld video cameras, ""Jackass"" franchise had humble, low-tech beginning .
