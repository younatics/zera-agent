"(CNN) -- Kenyan officials sent mediators into Somalia Sunday after captors took a kidnapped French woman there, a Kenyan government official said. ""We have sent mediators to find out what are their requests or what are their issues,"" Kenyan Tourism Minister Najib Balala told CNN. Meanwhile, he said Kenyan security officials were planning their next move and weighing whether to enter Somalia and attack. ""We have realized it is an aggression of foreign people and we cannot tolerate it as a government. We believe that if we go into Somalia and also attack on them, I think it will teach them a lesson,"" Balala said. A sea battle failed to rescue the French woman, who was seized in Kenya early Saturday, Balala said. But the clashes left two of her captors injured, he said. Gunmen snatched the woman early Saturday from her holiday home in Manda Island, close to where a Briton was abducted and her husband killed last month. They were ""10 heavily armed Somali bandits suspected to be al-Shabaab operatives"" from Ras Kamboni, across the border in Somalia, Kenyan security minister George Saitoti said in a statement. Security forces pursued the men as they raced in a high-speed boat toward the border, but despite the Kenya navy injuring several abductors in a shoot-out, they managed to reach Ras Kamboni, according to Saitoti. ""In the meantime, every effort is being made to rescue the victim,"" he said. French authorities are not releasing the woman's name, said Eric Bosc, a spokesman for the French Foreign Affairs Ministry. She is in her 60s and lives in Kenya about six months a year, and French authorities are doing everything they can to free her, the spokesman said. However, Balala identified her as Marie Dedieu, 75. Kenyan officials and an acquaintance said the woman uses a wheelchair and is not in good health. It is the second kidnapping near the popular tourist town of Lamu in a month. Gunmen fatally shot a British man and kidnapped his wife, Judith Tebbutt, from a safari lodge near the town last month. David Tebbutt was killed in the attack when he resisted, according to Kenyan police. The U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued revised travel advice to its citizens traveling near the Somali border. ""We advise against all but essential travel to coastal areas within 150 km of the Somali border, following two attacks by armed gangs in small boats against beach resorts in the Lamu area on 11 September and 1 October 2011,"" the statement said. Its previous advice cautioned against travel within 60 kilometers (37 miles) of the border. Security analysts have said Judith Tebbutt is being held by pirates in a remote corner of Somalia. British government officials have asked journalists not to reveal her exact location to avoid abduction attempts from rival gangs. The French embassy in Nairobi urged ""extreme caution"" for people visiting Lamu and the surrounding area. Balala said Sunday that Dedieu's kidnapping was an ""isolated incident"" and stressed that the nation's beaches were safe. ""We are doing everything possible to rescue these two visitors of ours,"" he said. ""We value them dearly."" Manda Island is made up of luxury homes and some small hotels. It is directly across a narrow channel from Shella Beach, one of the most popular -- and long considered safest -- tourist spots in Kenya, on Lamu Island. The channel runs straight from the open ocean. It is off-season in the area, an is frequented by Europeans and other expatriates living in Kenya. Hadija Ernst, a resident of the area and editor of the local magazine Chonju, said the abductions have put local residents and tourists on edge. ""The people are actually leaving, the tourists that are here are leaving because of the reports that we're getting,"" she said. Ernst, who knows the kidnapped woman, said she is a ""kind and gentle person."" ""She's very interested in Swahili culture, the culture of the island here,"" she said. Security in the area should have been improved following the first kidnapping, Ernst said. She has not seen any signs of increased security in the area and worries that the tourist economy in the area will suffer. ""So we are all very concerned and we want to see the government take this matter very seriously,"" she said. Saitoti called the abduction a serious violation of Kenya's territorial integrity.

"Tokyo is a huge and often confusing city for travelers, but with these tips you needn't be daunted by the Japanese capital. 100 Yen shops are great value for money. Subway Tokyo has an incredibly efficient subway, but the 13 lines are run by two different companies, Toei Subways and Tokyo Metro, meaning a bewildering variety of day passes are available. A good bet is the Toei and Tokyo Metro One-Day Economy Pass, which costs ¥1,000 and gives you a day of unlimited travel on all subway lines. During rush-hour the subway becomes an unbearable crush. All social niceties go out the window in a free for all that's best avoided completely. Taxis During the day traffic can be gridlocked, but in the evening, when traffic is lighter, taxis are reasonably alternative to the subway. Enter and exit taxis by the back left-hand door. Don't make the novice's error of trying to open or close the door -- your white-gloved driver will do that from the front seat. Ideally, have a map of your destination, or at least an address written in Japanese. Tipping is not expected. ATMs Although Tokyo is ultra-modern, you may have to revert to carrying travelers' checks for the duration of your stay. Few ATMs accept foreign cards, although you should have more luck at post offices and branches of Citibank. ATMs in busy areas stay open until 9 p.m. and most are closed at weekends, although Citibank has 24-hour ATMs. Credit cards are still not accepted as widely as you might expect, so travelers' checks are your best bet -- and make sure you're carrying cash if you're planning a night out away from the city center. What's on The best way to keep up with events and entertainment is with one of Tokyo's English language magazines. Metropolis and Tokyo Notice Board are two of the best -- and they're both free. 100 Yen shops These bargain stores are hugely popular in Tokyo, selling everything from food to toiletries for ¥100 plus ¥5 tax -- about $1. They are also a great place to pick up an inexpensive, kitschy souvenir. Daiso 100-Yen Shop in Takeshita-dori (Village 107 Building, 1-19-24 Jingumae, Shibuya-ku) has four floors of cheap thrills. Etiquette As a foreigner, having a generally courteous demeanor will cover a multitude of sins, but there are a few rules you should try to remember: . - Never use your chopsticks to take food from someone else's and don't stick your chopsticks upright in your food when you've finished -- both of these denote funerary customs. - If you're eating with other people, don't pour your own drink. Fill your neighbor's glass and wait for them to reciprocate. - The Japanese don't pour sauces onto their rice. Leave any sauces in their serving dish and dip your food in lightly. - It's a faux pas be seen eating in public -- especially on a train.

"(CNN) -- Seattle could see one of its largest snowfalls since the 1940s as twin winter storms move over the Pacific Northwest, according to the National Weather Service. Between 5 and 10 inches of snow could hit the Seattle-Tacoma area Wednesday, said Dustin Guy, a meteorologist at the weather service's Seattle office. Precipitation moving in from the south and west is combining with cold air moving south from Canada to create the heavy snowfall, Guy said. If snowfall amounts top 7 inches, the winter weather event will rank among Seattle's 10 worst since the early 1940s, Guy said. High-wind warnings were in effect along the coast, where winds could gust to hurricane force -- knocking down trees and causing power outages, said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. Wednesday's snowfall in Seattle may equal its annual average, Ward said. Mountainous areas of the Pacific Northwest will see even more snow, with the largest accumulations on the eastern slopes of the Cascades, according to the weather service. Significant snowfall is expected across southern Washington, northwest Oregon and into western Idaho. Portland could see about 3 inches, according to Ward. From late Tuesday through early Thursday, 2 feet to 3.5 feet of snow is forecast for the mountains east of Seattle, Guy said. Mount Rainier could see 10 feet of snow by Friday. The first storm moved into the area Monday and Tuesday. The second and stronger storm was forecast to hit Wednesday into Thursday. ""It's pretty big when you get back-to-back storms like that,"" weather service meteorologist Roger Cloutier said. Scattered areas near Easton, Washington, along Interstate 90 in the Cascade Mountains 55 miles east of Seattle, have already received 32 inches of snow, Cloutier said. The snowfall extends south into Oregon, with as much as 18 inches forecast for the Bend area. CNN affiliate KTVZ-TV in Bend said an earlier round of snow over the weekend gave a boost to local ski resorts but also created treacherous driving conditions that left at least one motorist dead. Those conditions were expected to worsen. Winter storm warnings were in effect across the region. ""Expect extreme travel difficulties to develop on Wednesday,"" the weather service said, advising those who must take to the roads during the storm to carry a flashlight, blankets and extra food and water. The Washington State Department of Transportation said 1,250 workers will use nearly 500 pieces of equipment statewide to treat and plow roadways. CNN affiliate KING-TV reported that Seattle Public Schools opted to close all schools two hours early. The heavy snowfall will be followed by rain, which could produce ponding water and urban flooding, Guy said. ""It's just gonna be a mess all around,"" he said of the coming few days in the Seattle area. Cloutier said even though computer models are trending colder and colder for the coming days, the heavy snow will eventually pose a flooding threat. ""When the snow does finally melt, you can almost guarantee there will be some flooding somewhere,"" he said.","NEW: Seattle prepares for significant snowfall .

"(CNN) -- A major winter storm bore down on the Great Plains on Wednesday night with the Minneapolis, Minnesota, area ""right in the teeth"" of it, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""There's potential for the northwest part of the city to see an almost record-breaking snow event,"" Myers said. The rest of the city could see about a foot of snow, he said. Winds could gusts 40 to 50 miles per hour, creating blizzard-like conditions for hours, he said. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for central and southern Minnesota and portions of west-central Wisconsin starting Wednesday night through Christmas. ""Strong north winds will develop, causing widespread blowing and heavy drifting snow,"" the Weather Service said. Visibility will be near zero at times. The inclement weather is the second major storm system to hit the United States in a week. Last week, a nor'easter blanketed a swath of the East Coast in snow, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights over the weekend. The Weather Service said Wednesday heavy snow will hit central South Dakota. ""Gusty northwest winds"" are expected with and ""frigid wind chill readings"" across the plains of western South Dakota. In Chicago, Illinois, a mix of rain, ice and snow caused Southwest Airlines to cancel departures for much of Wednesday afternoon before resuming take-offs, according to CNN affiliate WLS-TV in Chicago. ""Well, I'm disappointed,"" stranded traveler Araceli Martinez told WLS. ""Pretty sad we're going to have to sleep here."" The airline stopped its planes from flying from 1 to 4 p.m. before getting back on schedule, according to WLS. Holiday travelers in the Denver, Colorado, area, left earlier than they planned because of the threat of inclement weather, according to CNN affiliate 7NEWS in Denver. ""We thought maybe we would go tomorrow, but we decided tonight was probably going to be better weather than tomorrow or tomorrow night,"" Scott Aldridge, who was traveling from Greeley to Meeker on Tuesday night to spend Christmas with relatives, told 7NEWS. In Texas, a tornado watch was in effect for all of East Texas late Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate KLTV in Tyler, Texas. Kevin Brownlee, public information officer for the Longview, Texas Police Department, said a tornado touched down south of Highway 80. ""We've got several businesses there that have sustained major building damage,"" he said, including FedEx and Maid-Rite. Although no injuries were reported, Brownlee said, the tornado caused ""high wind damage, some water damage."" The weather caused several road closures because debris and downed power lines, Brownlee said. In addition to isolated tornadoes, scattered thunderstorms were expected to continue throughout the evening with the possibility of large hail stones and wind gusts, KLTV said.","NEW: Tornado rips through Longview, Texas, downing power lines .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The government of Sudan on Monday ordered Kenya's ambassador to leave the country, after the Kenyan High Court ruled that Sudan's president must be arrested if he sets foot on Kenyan soil. Sudan's Minister of Foreign Affairs gave Kenyan Ambassador Robert Mutua Ngesu 72 hours to leave the country, according to state media. The expulsion was a direct reaction to the court ruling, the Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. The Sudanese foreign ministry also summoned its ambassador to Kenya back to Khartoum, SUNA reported. President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, is wanted by the International Criminal Court at the Hague in relation to alleged crimes in Darfur. The Kenyan High Court ruling was the result of a case that the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) brought against Kenya's attorney general and internal security minster in 2010. ""The courts have said that Kenya has an obligation to arrest Bashir if he is to come to country, if there was doubt as to the legal position, that has been clarified,"" says George Kegoro, the executive director of the ICJ. Al-Bashir visited Kenya last year to attend the ceremony for a new constitution. At the time Kenyan officials said that Kenya was beholden to African Union decisions on arresting the Sudanese president. According to the ICJ, the court said local laws and international agreements such as the Rome Statue that Kenya has signed supersede African Union policies. ""We are satisfied with the ruling and we hope that it clarifies the legal and political situation in Kenyans relationship with Sudan,"" said Kegoro. The High Court and Justice Ministry did not respond to queries from CNN.","NEW: Expulsion is a reaction to the Kenyan court decision to arrest Sudan's president .

"(CNN) -- The Saudi Arabian government is objecting to a number of proposed new Internet address endings, including .gay, .bar, .baby and .islam. The country claims the .gay domain would promote homosexuality and would be offensive to ""many societies and cultures."" Saudi Arabia's Communication and Information Technology Commission (CITC) filed objections to 31 domain extensions, primarily on cultural and religious grounds. The suffixes are some of the 1,927 top-level domain names currently being considered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the organization in charge of managing Internet naming standards. If approved, the dot-extensions would be available for new URLs, joining familiar extensions .com and .org, and country extensions such as .uk. New top-level domains would greatly expand the number of possible website addresses around the world, but getting the world to agree on common terms, trademarks and topics is a complicated undertaking. ICANN opened up the application process to the public, charging $185,000 for each nomination, and announced the list of candidates in June. As part of the open-consideration process, third-parties are allowed to file public comments of opposition or support at no cost for these top-level domains, as well as formal objections which cost around $2,500 to file. So far, the group has received no formal objections, but 6,185 public comments from individuals, organizations, companies and governments, including 166 from the Saudi Arabian government. ""We are very enthusiastic to promote the objection processes so that everyone is aware of them,"" ICANN chief executive Akram Atallah told CNN. ""That's a very powerful tool, that any individual can comment on an application and potentially stop the delegation process."" ICANN officials won't comment on individual applications or complaints, but encourages objections like those made by Saudi Arabia as a key part of the vetting process. ""Many societies and cultures consider homosexuality to be contrary to their culture, morality or religion,"" says the CITC in its complaint. The group regulates information technology in Saudi Arabia. The objections filed by Saudi Arabia highlight the cultural issues at play for many of the more controversial domains, including anything having to do with sex, gambling, drinking and religion. When Johnson & Johnson applied for the .baby name, it was likely thinking it was a great way to promote its line of well-known baby products. However, in its complaint, the Saudi Arabian government says the name could be used to host pornographic websites, and that ""pornography undermines gender equality and threatens public morals."" The government uses the same reason in objections to various sex-related top-level domains, including .porn, .sexy, .adult, .hot, .sex, .dating and .virgin. The country is objecting to .islam because the applicant is a private company that ""cannot represent the whole or even a majority of the worldwide Muslim community."" It argues that all religious communities should have a say in any approval of any related domain extensions, or they should be banned altogether. It also filed complaints for .catholic and .bible. Saudi Arabia isn't the only government filing complaints with ICANN. American clothing retailer Patagonia has applied for .patagonia, riling up the government of Argentina where the Patagonia region,Â named by Magellan in 1520, is located. The Royal Australian Navy is objecting to the .oldnavy and .navy extensions due to an Australian law that prohibits anyone not in the navy from using the word without permission. Â . International trademark disputes are also common, a company name trademarked in one country may belong to an entirely different corporation someplace else, as is the issue with .abc (used by the American Broadcasting Company and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation) and .merck.Â . ICANN has set up a detailed system for handling issues for each disputed top-level domain, which includes four types of objection processes, review panels and third-party arbitrators. The full process and resulting applicant guidebook has taken about five years to develop and includes various advisory committees to help represent third-party interests, such as the the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), which advises ICANN on international and local laws. Saudi Arabia does not currently have a representative on the GAC. ICANN estimates the dispute resolution process will take up to 11 months and will include criminal and financial background checks on applicants to ensure they have the knowledge and resources to support the registry. The organization hopes to roll out new names at a pace of 40 a week, according to Atallah, though the exact timing is still to be determined. Companies have a lot of money at stake in this Internet land grab, both brands that want their own vanity domains and the Internet registries that will profit by selling the new URLs. General names are the most sought after, including .app, .inc and .music. The public can submit comments until September 26 and formal complaints though January 2013.","Government of Saudi Arabia files objection to .gay domain extension .

"(CNN) -- Fox just announced two very different long-form projects in development based on best-selling books: James Clavell's classic novel ""Shōgun"" and legal journalist Jeffrey Toobin's ""The Run of His Life: The People vs. O.J. Simpson"" are both in the works for ""event series"" treatment. ""These are both epic stories -- one fiction, one fact -- that have captivated millions of people worldwide,"" said Shana C. Waterman, a senior vp at Fox. ""They're riveting and emotional, with unique historic backdrops that lend themselves to the high-quality, dramatic event series we're looking to make."" The projects are dubbed ""event series"" by Fox instead of the traditional term ""mini-series."" The distinction: They're longer (10 to 12 parts) and could hypothetically extend beyond one season (though the Simpson project seems pretty self-contained). The shows have notable auspices on board — Shōgun is from producers Michael De Luca (The Social Network) and Nigel Williams (Elizabeth I); The Run of His Life: The People vs. O.J. Simpson, which chronicles Simpson's 1995 murder trial, is from Nina Jacobson (The Hunger Games) and Brad Simpson (World War Z). 'Star Trek Into Darkness': New trailer . Shōgun was previously adapted into an NBC miniseries in 1980 starring Richard Chamberlain. More notoriously, Fox scheduled a two-part interview with Simpson in 2006 as part of the promotional tour for his planned quasi-confessional book If I Did It. The network touted in the press release, ""Simpson describes how he would have carried out the murders he has vehemently denied committing for over a decade."" After public outcry and several of the network's affiliates balking at the prospect of airing the interview, Fox decided not to air the special. Han Solo again? 'I think it's almost true' Official descriptions: . SHŌGUN, based on the best-selling novel by James Clavell, opens a window into the brutal world of a rarely seen feudal Japan. Set in the 17th Century, the story is told from the perspective of British hero John Blackthorne, a sailor who rises from outsider to samurai, while being used as a pawn in Japanese leader Toranaga's struggle to reach the top of the ruling chain, or Shōgun. A classic for the ages, SHŌGUN is both a cross-cultural exploration of Blackthorne's journey away from the European way of life, and a star-crossed love story, as he falls for the magnificent Lady Mariko, the married confidant to Toranaga. Everybody remembers where they were when O.J. Simpson, riding in a white Bronco, led the police on a low-speed chase all over Los Angeles. This marked the emergence of the 24-hour news cycle and the birth of reality television. Written by Golden Globe Award winners Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (""The People vs. Larry Flint,"" ""Man on the Moon,"" ""Ed Wood""), THE RUN OF HIS LIFE: THE PEOPLE V. O.J.

"(CNN) -- A major winter storm is expected to dump snow and ice across the southeastern United States Sunday night and Monday, potentially triggering power outages and possibly impacting travel throughout the country. The latest computer models show wintry weather extending from northeast Texas through the Carolinas, bringing freezing temperatures, snow and ice to areas that normally don't see heavy winter precipitation, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. The northern regions of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas should expect heavy snow, while ice storms are expected to affect the southern regions of those states, he said. Below freezing temperatures through Tuesday could leave trees and power lines across the south with a heavy coating of ice, said Hennen, which could cause numerous long-duration power outages. A winter storm warning has been issued by the National Weather Service for parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama. The agency warns that significant snow amounts could make travel difficult and dangerous. Three to eight inches of snow could fall by Monday evening and roads are expected to be hazardous through Monday night, especially secondary roads. A winter storm watch has also been put in place by the weather agency, stretching from northeast Texas to the far western corner of Virginia. Snow should begin falling in Atlanta during the evening hours Sunday, Hennen said, and it should continue to accumulate through Monday afternoon. Temperatures at or below freezing are expected to remain in place through Tuesday, keeping roads dangerous and travel difficult, he added. Hennen expects the storm to severely impact Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. He said hundreds of flights could be cancelled, which would affect air travel all over the U.S. Parts of Louisiana could get up to an inch of ice, while other states in the region could get between a quarter and a half-inch of ice coating power lines, trees, bridges and roadways, CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf said. Alabama's Emergency Management Agency began warning residents on Friday of the weekend storm. ""It is really important for Alabama residents to take this threat of severe weather serious, freezing weather over an extended period of time has the potential to cause power outages and an interruption in communication services,"" Alabama EMA Director Brock Long said in a statement. Meanwhile, airlines were preparing for possible travel snarls ahead of the storm. ""Our big concern from an operating stand point is Dallas-Fort Worth. It depends on how quickly the snow moves eastward,"" said American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith. American had not canceled any flights in the region as of Saturday morning, but was monitoring the forecast, Smith said. Anthony Black, a spokesman for Delta, said the airline expects ""to start seeing an impact tomorrow night (Sunday) around 6 p.m."" ""We will have flights canceled beginning then (and) probably through until as late as early Tuesday morning,"" Black said. Meanwhile, snow moved into the Northeast but the region was spared a repeat of the Christmas blizzard that virtually shut down such large cities as New York and Philadelphia. Emergency management officials were able to quickly recover from the comparably light dusting of snow that began blanketing the region Friday. AirTran Airways had canceled only three flights Saturday morning into or out of New York's LaGuardia and Boston's Logan airports. All of the major airports were operating as normal Saturday with the exception of Philadelphia International Airport, which was under a ground delay due to the snowfall. ""In addition to being under an air traffic control ground delay program, they're also de-icing aircrafts and that could tend to slow things down,"" Southwest Airlines spokesman Chris Mainz said. More than 400 flights were canceled Friday due to the storm. Several major airlines -- including American, United/Continental, U.S. Airways and Delta -- announced that their customers could voluntarily reschedule flights to and from snow-affected areas without penalty. The heavy snow over the Christmas weekend hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. Following sharp criticism of the city's slow response, John Doherty, the chief of the sanitation department, has made management and personnel shake-ups in Brooklyn. An investigation is currently under way into whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed cleanup efforts over frustrations about demotions and citywide budget cuts. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","NEW: Snow, ice and freezing temperatures are expected across the southeastern U.S.

"Nairobi (CNN) -- Kenyan troops are pursuing suspected Islamic militants from Al-Shabaab across the border into Somalia, Kenyan government spokesman Alfred Mutua told CNN Sunday. The move marks a dramatic shift in security tactics for the east African powerhouse, which is evoking the United Nations charter allowing military action in self-defense against its largely lawless neighbor. ""If you are attacked by an enemy, you have to pursue that enemy through hot pursuit and to try hit wherever that enemy is,"" said Defense Minister Yusuf Haji in a news conference aired on CNN affiliate NTV. Haji said repeatedly that the Kenyan military was ready to pursue ""terrorists"" inside the war-torn country. ""If a country is provoked and its territorial boundary is violated, a country has all the right to deal with the crisis wherever it is,"" said George Saitoti, the minister for Internal Security. Al-Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda and has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, is fighting to impose its own interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, on Somalia. Recent abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya have heightened tensions. On September 11, armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where Britons Judith and David Tebbutt, both in their 50s, were staying. David Tebbutt was shot dead while trying to resist the attack. His wife was grabbed and spirited away onboard the pirates' speedboat. She is believed to have been taken into Somalia. And on October 1, pirates made another cross-border raid, this time snatching a French woman in her 60s from the holiday home on Manda Island where she lived for part of the year. Last week, gunmen abducted two Spanish workers for the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) from the Dadaab refugee complex, about 80 kilometers from the Somali border. Kenya announced its new tactics less than a week after African Union forces claimed a victory against Al-Shabaab in Mogadishu, the Somali capital. They took the remaining Al-Shabaab strongholds in the far northeast of Mogadishu, the military said Monday. ""It has been a big achievement to remove Al-Shabaab from the city, and put an end to the fighting that disrupted so many lives,"" African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) spokesman Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda said. ""The challenge is now to protect civilians from the sort of terror attack we saw last week, as they attempt to rebuild their lives,"" he said. He was referring to a suicide truck bombing in the heart of Mogadishu that left dozens dead. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Other Al-Shabaab attacks that week led to the deaths of at least 10 civilians. Federal and African Union forces in the impoverished and chaotic nation have battled the group for years. Many analysts believe AMISOM's military push against Al-Shabaab has severely affected the group, along with targeted strikes against its members and the weakening of al Qaeda. Al-Shabaab said in August that it was withdrawing from Mogadishu, and Somalia's Transitional Federal Government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, now controls most districts of the capital city, the United Nations office said. Forces have pushed Al-Shabaab outside most of Mogadishu, but the group is still a major threat, Ankunda said earlier.","NEW: Abductions of tourists, workers in Kenya have heightened tensions .

"(CNN) -- The facts: On August 27, 1891, a passenger train jumped the tracks on a tall bridge near Statesville, North Carolina, sending seven rail cars below and about 30 people to their deaths. The legend: On the wreck's anniversary, the sounds of screeching wheels, screaming passengers and a horrific crash might still be heard. You might also see a uniformed man with a gold watch. Shortly before 3 a.m. Friday, on the 119th anniversary of the Bostian Bridge train tragedy and at about the same time, between 10 and 12 ghost hunters were on that approximately 300-foot long span. They were hoping to hear the sounds of the crash, and perhaps see something. Instead, a real Norfolk-Southern train -- three engines and one car -- turned the corner as it headed east to Statesville, about 35 miles north of Charlotte, authorities said. The terrified ""amateur ghost watchers"" ran away, back toward Statesville, trying to cover the nearly 150 feet to safety, said Iredell County Sheriff's Office Capt. Darren Campbell. All but two made it. Christopher Kaiser, 29, of Charlotte, was struck and killed, said Campbell. A woman who witnesses say Kaiser pushed to safety fell about 30 to 40 feet from the trestle and was injured. Her name and condition were not known Friday night. She was being treated at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. ""There was no way out, said Campbell. ""They almost made it."" The engineer of the train, which was traveling at its customary 35 to 40 mph, hit the horn and ""stopped as fast as he could,"" Campbell said. Campbell, 38, is from the area and has heard all the stories, although he said he knows of no one who has ever seen or heard the ""ghost train."" On the 50th anniversary of the Bostian Bridge incident, a woman said she witnessed it all again. In 1991, hawkers sold T-shirts and other memorabilia, and there were an estimated 150 people waiting for the train, according to the Charlotte Observer. There are occasional reports of railroad crossing arms dropping without cause, Campbell said. The ghost trip on the anniversary has become an annual tradition of sorts. A woman who did not want to be identified, but who was part of the group of onlookers, told CNN affiliate WCNC, ""We were there looking for what people say happened.

"(CNN) -- Silicon Valley giant Yahoo is turning to a 17-year-old to boost the company's mobile development by acquiring the teenager's tech start-up in a reported multi-million dollar deal. Summly -- the brain child of London-based boy genius Nick D'Aloisio -- delivers automated snapshots of news stories to its users on mobile devices and formats articles for the small screen. D'Aloisio started the company when he was 15 and quickly attracted investors, including Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing and Hollywood stars Ashton Kutcher and Stephen Fry. In a statement on the Summly website, teenager D'Aloisio paid tribute to his friends, family and users while adding that Yahoo! is the ""perfect fit"" for the start-up company, which received Apple's Best Apps of 2012 award for Intuitive Touch. In November, Yahoo boss Marissa Mayer said the U.S. multinational would start focusing more on mobile strategy particularly on news, sports and apps. In a blog post announcing the deal, Adam Cahan, senior vice president of mobile and emerging products at Yahoo, wrote: ""Mobile devices are at the center of how we engage with the people experiences and interests we love."" Cahan added: ""Most articles and web pages were formatted for browsing with mouse clicks. The ability to skim them on a phone or a tablet can be a real challenge... Summly solves this by delivering snapshots of stories, giving you a simple and elegant way to find the news you want, faster than ever before."" Although the details of the deal are not disclosed, the acquisition is likely to make a millionaire of teenager D'Aloisio, who will now join Yahoo!

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has ordered a federal appeals court to take another look at whether a key requirement in the health care reform law violates religious freedoms. A pending lawsuit from the private Liberty University had claimed, among other things, that the law would lead to taxpayer dollars funding abortions and contraception, a claim the Obama administration rejects. The justices issued their order Monday. The high court in June had upheld the overall law championed by President Obama, but left room for continued legal challenges to certain aspects of the law's application.

A three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in 2011 unanimously concluded the university's lawsuit should be blocked on jurisdictional grounds. There is no indication when the appeals court will revisit the issue in the wake of the high court's order. After the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's funding mechanism -- the so-called individual mandate requiring nearly all Americans to purchase health insurance or pay a financial penalty -- it tossed out all other pending appeals. Liberty University then refiled its lawsuit, saying its objections to the law should be reconsidered in light of the court's 5-4 ruling affirming the overall law.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Two separate grenade attacks hit the Kenyan coast Saturday night, killing one person and wounding at least 33 others, officials said. One grenade in the southeastern town of Mtwapa killed one person and injured 31 others, said Nelly Mulluka, a spokeswoman for the Kenya Red Cross. A second grenade hurled into a stadium in the coastal city of Mombasa injured two others, she said. The attacks occurred in communities along the Indian Ocean, southeast of the Nairobi capital. The East African nation has been on edge since it sent its troops into Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab militants after the abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya. It blames the abductions on Al-Shabaab, which has denied involvement. While no one has directly claimed responsibility, a statement posted online Sunday credited to Al-Shabaab said ""the deteriorating insecurity in Kenyan cities is an embodiment of Kenya's misguided policies that place foreign interests above its national interests and the security of Western nations above the security of its citizens, thereby wasting the lives of its men and its resources for no real gain."" Al-Shabaab, which the United States considers a terror group, has threatened to attack Kenya if it does not withdraw its forces from Somalia. ""The Kenyan public must be aware that the more Kenyan troops continue to persecute innocent Muslims of Somalia, the less secure Kenyan cities will be; and the more oppression the Muslims of Somalia feel, the more constricted Kenyan life will be,"" the statement said. ""Such is the law of Retribution. Your security depends on our security. It is a long, protracted war and Kenyans must neither harbour a reason for optimism nor hope for triumph."" While CNN could not independently verify the statement's origins, it posted on jihadist website that frequently published the group's statements.

"(CNN) -- Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko have confirmed that one of them will fight Poland's Tomasz Adamek for their world heavyweight titles in September. Confirmation of whether it will be Vitali, who holds the World Boxing Council (WBC) belt, or Wladimir, the World Boxing Organization (WBO) and International Boxing Federation (IBF) champion, who will face Adamek is expected to be announced in the next few weeks. The 34-year-old Adamek, a former light-heavyweight and cruiserweight world champion, has an impressive record -- winniing 43 of his 44 fights with his only defeat coming to American Chad Dawson in 2007. Since moving up to heavweight, Adamek has won all his five heavyweight bouts, including an impressive points win over former world title challenger Chris Arreola. However, before any fight takes place, with one of the new stadiums being built for the Euro 2012 football tournament in Poland the likely venue, a series of other bouts must happen first. Vitali Klitschko will face Cuban Odlanier Solis in Cologne, Germany on March 19, while younger brother Wladimir takes on Briton Dereck Chisora in Mannheim, Germany on April 30. Adamek himself is also scheduled to have a fight in April. Should both Klitchko brothers lose, the deal with Adamek would be dead. If one loses, Adamek would face the other brother. If both Klitschko brothers win, the choice of Adamek's opponent would be decided by the Klitschko side. Speaking on the official Klitschko website, Adamek said: ""It doesn't make a difference to me which Klitschko I fight. ""Right now they are both the biggest stars in the boxing world right now and I want to fight the biggest stars. I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he added. The news will be a bitter blow to Briton David Haye, who holds the other major belt, the World Boxing Association (WBA) title. Haye had been negotiating with the Klitschko brothers over a possible unification fight, but has publicly stated that if that does not happen by October, he will retire form the sport.","Vitali or Wladimir Klitschko will fight Tomasz Adamek in Poland in September .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former U.S. Army soldier was charged Monday with attempting to travel to Somalia to join the terrorist group Al-Shabaab, according to the Justice Department. Craig Benedict Baxam, 24, was arrested Friday at Baltimore-Washington International Airport as he returned from a failed effort to get to Somalia, authorities said. The Maryland resident had an initial court appearance Monday afternoon on the charge of attempting to provide material support to a terrorist group. The only time Baxam spoke during the hearing was to respond ""Yes"" when the judge asked if he understood the charge against him and the possible penalty. Magistrate Judge William Connolly ordered that Baxam will remain in jail at least until he returns to court Wednesday for a detention hearing. According to a criminal complaint, Baxam departed the United States on December 20 en route to Kenya and tried to travel on to Somalia from there. He was arrested by Kenyan authorities on December 23, on suspicion of terrorism. Baxam was interviewed twice by FBI agents while he was in Kenyan custody and allegedly told them he wanted to join Al-Shabaab, live under Sharia law and never intended to to leave Somalia. According to the criminal complaint, Baxam said he was ""looking for dying with a gun in my hand"" and said he would be guaranteed a place in paradise. Prosecutors say Baxam secretly converted to Islam just days before leaving the Army in July. He joined the Army in 2007 and underwent eight months of advanced training for cryptology and intelligence, according to the government. After his training, Baxam was deployed to Baghdad and to South Korea where he separated from the service one month before the completion of his deployment. The court document does not explain how Baxam left the Army early. A law enforcement official said there is no information to suggest Baxam compromised any military information. ""Mr. Baxam was caught in Kenya before he reached Somalia, and there is no allegation that anyone assisted him,"" said Rod Rosenstein, U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland. According to the criminal complaint, Baxam told the FBI he didn't have names of any contacts to reach out to in Somalia but that he ""trusted in Allah."" ""He was asked what he thought his role would be with Al-Shabaab to which he stated that he would just be another body there,"" according to the court document. Prosecutors say Baxam cashed out his retirement savings account of a little over $3,600 dollars and purchased a round trip ticket to Kenya to avoid arousing suspicion. He allegedly planned to give Al-Shabaab some amount between $600 and $700 dollars as an offering upon his arrival, authorities said. ""FBI Special Agents in Africa, working alongside our Kenyan police partners, worked together to stop an individual who is now alleged to have been on his way to join a major terrorist group,"" said Richard McFeely, the FBI agent in charge of the Baltimore office. ""This spirit of cooperation in fighting terrorism continues to transcend borders around the world."" If convicted of attempting to provide material support to terrorists, Baxam faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release. CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.","The man was arrested Friday as he returned to the United States .

"(Mashable) -- Apple has taken firm root in America. Just over half of all households in the country own at least one Apple product, a new survey says, showing just how far the reach of the company has come in the last decade. At the turn of the 21st century, Apple was in rough shape. It had narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and Steve Jobs' return as CEO a few years earlier was turning the company around, but the market share of its products -- then almost exclusively Mac computers -- was dismal, at about 2% worldwide. Then came the iPod, which begat the iPhone and the iPad. As Apple's gadgets gobbled up market share (and in some cases created new markets), its Macs experienced a rebound, too. Now, according to CNBC's All-American Economic Survey, 51% of U.S. households own at least one Apple product. Few brands have such a deep reach among American consumers. Certainly, product categories such as refrigerators or even smartphones have achieved even deeper penetration, but looking at single companies, it's a short list with probable names such as GE (light bulbs) or 3M (Scotch tape). Reducing to just technology companies would make it even shorter. See also: Sorry, Google: Apple is America's Valentine This Year [study] . Of the households that own Apple products, they own an average of three, making the overall ownership rate of the American public 1.6 Apple products per household. About 25% plan to buy another Apple product in the next year. The survey shows Apple buyers tend to skew male, young, with higher education and incomes (77% of households making $75,000 or more have an Apple product). If you have kids, the likelihood of being an Apple household grows -- 61% compared with 48% if you don't. As far as politics is concerned, both Republicans and Democrats appear to like Apple products equally, with 56% of people counting themselves a member of either party owning Apple, although a greater portion of Democrats plan to buy more products soon. CNBC's survey polled 836 Americans via both landlines and cellphones over three days in March. The network says it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4%. Do you own Apple products?

"(CNN) -- Promosing Briton Amir Khan took a huge step towards a world title shot at lightweight after a fifth-round technical decision win over Mexican legend Marco Antonio Barrera in Manchester on Saturday. Amir Khan (right) lands another punch on Marco Antonio Barrera on his way to a points victory on Saturday. Khan, 22, comfortably out-boxed his 35-year-old opponent -- a seven-time world champion at three different weights -- before a cut suffered in the first round eventually brought the contest to a premature end, forcing the result to be decided on the judges scorecards. The 2004 Olympic silver medalist faced a major step up in class against Barrera but victory means he could be in line for a world title shot later in the year, probably against WBO champion Juan Manuel Marquez. Despite being far from home, Barrera received a rapturous reception from the British crowd while Khan was amazingly booed by some. Khan boasted a significant height and reach advantage over his naturally smaller opponent as they squared up before the opening bell. Khan began the first round measured without being negative and was firing off lightning-quick volleys. Two excellent right hands landed and Barrera also found the target occasionally without hurting his man. But Barrera had suffered a cut as he took several hard left hooks and a decent right and ended the round with a bad gash over his left eye -- close to an old wound suffered in his last fight. Concerns about the injury proved to be well-founded as blood streamed down his face in the second round. Barrera could only really see from one eye and his task was made more difficult as Khan boxed, moved and showboated in the style of a future champion. The referee interrupted the fourth round to have Barrera's cut looked at by the ringside doctor and despite the severity of the injury, the fight carried on. Again the referee paused the action in the fifth to have the cut looked at and this time, with blood literally coursing down his face, the end finally came. The cut was ruled an accidental clash so the fight went to the scorecards, with the classy Khan winning by 50-44 and 50-45 twice.","Briton Amir Khan beats Mexican legend Marco Antonio Barrera in Manchester .

"(CNN) -- World health agencies plan to launch a massive polio vaccination in three West African nations, following a fast-moving and especially virulent outbreak that has already killed 97 people. Since the first confirmation of polio November 4 in the Republic of Congo, at least 226 people have been diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis -- a condition commonly associated with polio -- according to the United Nations. Of those, 97 had died as of Tuesday -- ""an unusually high mortality rate,"" the World Health Organization and U.N. Children's Fund said in a joint press release. At least four of the 226 total cases have already been confirmed as polio, a number that is expected to rise. In response, the United Nations said Thursday that a polio immunization campaign targeting 3 million children and adults will start Friday in the port city of Point Noire and the Koilou region inside the Republic of Congo, 16 districts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and parts of neighboring Angola. Most of the cases thus far have involved young adults between ages 15 and 29, the United Nations and World Health Organization noted. The immunization effort, however, will be all-inclusive. ""Every man, every woman, every child will be immunized irrespective of their past immunization status,"" Dr. Luis Sambo, the WHO regional director for Africa, said in a press release. ""This way we can be assured that everybody is reached, including young adults, whose immunity may be low."" UNICEF said that suspicious cases began to emerge in October, with 73 cases being reported in a hospital in Pointe Noire the week of October 18 alone. The World Health Organization said Wednesday the deaths occurred in and around that coastal city. Scientists have linked the resurgence of polio in the Republic of Congo -- which hadn't seen a case since at least 2004, according to WHO -- to a virus circulating in nearby Angola. ""The cases are continuing to rise,"" Sona Bari, a spokeswoman for the agency's polio eradication unit, said Wednesday. In a statement released by UNICEF, the Republic of Congo's health minister said his nation had a ""good assessment"" of what called a ""worrying"" situation. ""Partners and resources are being mobilized to implement an appropriate response,"" Georges Moyen said. Last month, a wide-scale and synchronized polio immunization drive was launched in 15 countries targeting 72 million people -- mostly infants and toddlers -- around Africa, the World Health Organization said. Some 290,000 people planned to go ""door-to-door to deliver two drops of oral polio vaccine"" to all children under 5 in high-risk areas. Health officials undertook a similar effort in 2009 as well as this past spring, after polio cases were confirmed in 24 African nations. That was followed by a sharp drop in diagnoses, including a 98 percent decrease in Nigerian polio cases in 2010 compared to 2009, the World Health Organization reported. Polio is a highly infectious disease that targets the nervous system, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those afflicted show no symptoms and 4 percent to 8 percent manifest relatively minor ones. Generally, polio sufferers are permanently paralyzed in less than 1 percent of cases. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","NEW: The Republic of Congo's health minister calls the polio outbreak ""worrying""

"(Health.com) -- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) appears to be on the rise in the United States, and in the search for explanations researchers have begun to scrutinize fetal exposure to a wide range of toxins, including lead, tobacco, pesticides, and chemicals such as PCBs. Mercury, a metal that affects the nervous system, is among the latest suspects to be investigated. And in a new study, researchers report that children who are exposed to higher levels of mercury in the womb are more likely to exhibit attention problems, hyperactivity, and other ADHD symptoms when they're 8 years old. The study included roughly 600 mothers and children from New Bedford, Massachusetts. The researchers measured prenatal mercury exposure by analyzing samples of the mothers' hair shortly after birth, and found that a child's risk of ADHD symptoms increased by 40% to 70% past a certain exposure threshold (1 microgram per gram). The association was seen primarily in boys, which wasn't unexpected, since previous research has shown that boys seem to respond differently than girls to chemicals that disrupt the endocrine system. Health.com: What causes ADHD? 12 myths and facts . ""This study and one other recent study--which both implicate prenatal mercury exposure [in] the development of ADHD--suggest that the impact of mercury is much greater than previously recognized,"" says Dr. Bruce P. Lanphear, M.D., a professor of children's environmental health at Simon Fraser University, in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the author of an editorial accompanying the new study. The other recent study, which was conducted in Inuit children in QuÃ©bec and published earlier this fall, produced similar results: Children who were exposed to higher prenatal levels of mercury (as measured by samples of umbilical-cord blood) were more likely to exhibit ADHD symptoms between the ages of 8 and 14. The new study, which appears in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, looks only at ADHD symptoms, rather than official diagnoses. And it shows only an association, not a cause-and-effect relationship. That said, it would be difficult to design a mercury-exposure study more rigorous than this one, since for ethical reasons pregnant womencould not be selectively exposed to high levels of mercury, which is known to be toxic to the developing fetus, says Dr. Elza Vasconcellos, M.D., a pediatric neurologist at Miami Children's Hospital. Health.com: Food additives that may affect ADHD . Aside from on-the-job exposure (which is common in mining and certain types of manufacturing), people are most likely to be exposed to mercury by eating fish that have ingested the metal in contaminated waters. This is why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that pregnant women eat no more than two six-ounce servings of low-mercury fish per week. In the study, however, fish consumption was not independently related to ADHD symptoms. In fact, when the authors conducted a second analysis among the same group of mothers and children, they found that the offspring of mothers who reported eating more than two servings of fish per week while pregnant actually had a 60% lower risk of ADHD symptoms. How to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings? One possibility is that the nutritional benefits of fish may offset the harmful effects of mercury, the authors suggest. Fish is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, healthy fats that are essential to brain development, Vasconcellos says. Health.com: Quiz: Do you have adult ADHD? ""It's possible to eat fish low in mercury and high in nutritional value, and it's possible to eat fish high in mercury and low in nutritional value,"" says Dr. Susan Korrick, M.D., the senior author of the study and an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham & Women's Hospital, in Boston. ""What really matters is the kind of fish you're eating."" But Korrick and her coauthors had no information on what type of fish these women ate. And even if they did, there's no reliable way to estimate which fish are high in mercury and which aren't. As a general rule, a fish's mercury content depends on the size of the fish (larger fish tend to contain more mercury), where it was caught, and how far along it is in its lifespan. Smaller, oily fishes such as salmon, herring, mackerel, and sardines tend to be low in mercury and yet high in omega-3s. Shark, swordfish, and fresh tuna, on the other hand, are more likely to contain high levels of mercury and a relatively modest amount of omega-3s, though there are exceptions to all of these rules. The potential link between mercury and ADHD will need to be explored further in future studies. In the meantime, Lanphear says, avoiding mercury-laden fish is only a short-term precaution. A more permanent solution to the contamination problem, he says, will require societies to reduce mercury emissions across the board.

"(CNN) -- It was an ugly scuffle that cast a cloud over the sport of boxing as Dereck Chisora threatened to shoot fellow Brit David Haye, after they'd brawled at a press conference. Now the pair have announced a rematch for July 14 in London -- this time in the more familiar surroundings of a boxing ring. The duo traded blows in Munich after Chisora had been beaten by WBC heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko back in February. The incident provoked widespread condemnation and saw Chisora stripped of his boxing license by the British authorities. Chisora banned by World Boxing Council for Haye brawl . But after the fight was sanctioned by the Luxembourg Boxing Federation, the British rivals continued their war of words at a more sedate press conference, where they were separated by a steel fence. ""He is the ideal opponent for me,"" Haye, the former WBA heavyweight champion said. ""I am so glad he has got a good chin because if he didn't have a good chin he would be blasted out in first round. ""This means I will give him a nice, slow, concussive beating. I tried to knock him out in Munich and this is the opportunity to shut him up."" Chisora replied: ""I don't like him. Talk is cheap now. That was a lucky shot he hit me with in Munich. Your talk is cheap. You always talk but you don't deliver in the ring."" The fight's promoter, Frank Warren, denied he was undermining British boxing by having the bout licensed by another federation, or that he was cashing in on the ugly incident in Munich. ""This is not the end of British boxing,"" Warren said. ""I believe it will be a sell out, a huge event. There are far far worse things happening in sport than what's happening here. ""No charges have been made against Haye or Dereck for what happened in Munich. The fight has been licensed by the governing body in Luxembourg, which has the same standards as the British Boxing Board of Control. Chisora threatens to shoot Haye in brawl following Klitschko defeat . ""It is the biggest fight of the year and the fact of the matter is that the fight is legal, lawful and will go ahead."" Even before his altercation with Haye in Munich, Chisora had caused controversy in the build up to his fight with Vitali. He slapped his opponent at the weigh in and spat water in the face of Vitali's brother Wladimir Klitschko, the current WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight champion, before his unanimous points defeat. Haye heckled Chisora at the post-fight press conference, before punching him in the face as they squared up. After the scuffle had broken up Chisora accused Haye of hitting him with a bottle and said: ""I am going to shoot David Haye."" Haye retired after he lost his WBA crown to Wladimir Klitschko last year but had been lobbying for a fight with Vitali. Meanwhile, Amir Khan's bid to regain his WBA light welterweight title from Lamont Peterson is in doubt after the American tested positive for a banned substance. The pair are scheduled to meet in Las Vegas on 19 May in a rematch after Peterson won a controversial points victory at their original fight in December. Peterson's camp said in a statement they were mystified by the test results, which showed synthetic testosterone, and that they remained hopeful the fight could go ahead. ""Lamont has never had a positive test either before or after this isolated occurrence, and we plan to submit medical findings by close of business Tuesday reflecting the actual facts in support of Lamont's good faith intentions and the requirements of the commission."" Peterson's split decision victory in Washington last year was controversial, Khan claiming he should have won the fight after being docked points by the referee.","British heavyweight boxers David Haye and Dereck Chisora to fight on July 14 in London .

"(CNN) -- The girl the Taliban wanted dead has not only survived but was able to walk out of the hospital last week. But other highly publicized, vicious attacks on women and girls have not had such triumphant outcomes. Malala Yousafzai's ordeal is not over yet: Doctors say the 15-year-old campaigner for girls' education, whom gunmen shot in the head as she rode a school bus in Pakistan, will be readmitted in late January or early February for more cranial reconstructive surgery. She left the hospital just days after gunmen attacked a van in Pakistan's Swabi District, less than an hour from the capital, and killed six women and one man who worked at a children's community center. Five of the dead were teachers; two were health care workers. The center, a charity, offered a school for girls and vaccinations for polio, among other diseases, along with maternal health treatment. Yet another attack unfolded around the time of Malala's release. India is reeling from the death of a woman who dreamed of becoming a doctor. Brutally gang raped, mutilated and thrown from a bus, the physiotherapy student later died in a Singapore hospital. Her name was not made public in India, but her cause electrified the nation. Her father, who sold family land to move his family to Delhi from rural India to help his daughter realize her education dreams, is left heartbroken. ""She wanted to be a doctor and said it was only a matter of a few years and that when she was a doctor (all our suffering), it will end,'"" her father told the BBC. ""I remember asking her once, 'Who are all your friends?' She replied, 'Dad, it's only my books I am friends with.'"" What all of these attacks have in common, along with their brutality, is that they are attempts at extinguishing the talent and potential of women -- or half of the population. In a world that needs every doctor it can find, every educator and politician who is willing to tackle the status quo, these young women offered a glimpse at a brighter future in which all can contribute. No less than investment oracle Warren Buffett made that very case recently, referring to the United States, which has seen its share of less brutal attempts to hold women back. ""What a waste of human talent; 50% of the talent of the country we pushed off in a corner for almost 200 years,"" he said in an interview with Melinda Gates. ""It is one of the things that makes me optimistic about the future -- we are getting to the point we are starting to realize we need to use 100% of our talent -- it makes me very optimistic, but we still have a way to go."" His words echoed those of the World Economic Forum in its annual Gender Gap Report. ""The key for the future of any country and any institution is the capability to develop, retain and attract the best talent,"" the report said. ""Empowering and educating girls and women and leveraging their talent and leadership fully in the global economy, politics and society are thus fundamental elements of succeeding and prospering in an ever more competitive world."" Until now these horrific attacks on women and girls, attacks I have written about concerning Afghanistan, have been seen as shameful and isolated incidents. But they are a shared loss in a globalized world. These young women and their legacies -- Malala, who will continue her fight, and the others, who will not -- are on the front lines of deciding what our world looks like. Will young women who speak out on the need for education be stopped or celebrated? Will girls who dream of becoming doctors stay alive long enough to do so? And when will we realize that their battle is one shared by everyone who dreams of a safer, more stable, more prosperous world in which more people have a stake? Perhaps Buffett's words will help enlist more fighters in the cause. Because the economic and human rights stakes are high. Increasingly the world is recognizing the value and the contributions of girls and women. But progress is slow while violence is tolerated. And as the attacks in Pakistan show, educating girls remains a potentially deadly line of work. ""They wanted to kill her,"" said her father not long after gunmen shot his daughter.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Four people were killed and several injured in an attack on a vehicle carrying government officials transporting school examination papers in northeastern Kenya Thursday, police said. The incident occurred about 110 kilometers (68 miles) from Mandera, a border town with Somalia, Kenya Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere said. It was unclear who carried out the attack on the car, he said, and police had been given conflicting accounts of what happened. The Kenyan Red Cross said four people had been killed in heavy machine-gun fire on a small car heading from Mandera to a school. Mandera is in a part of Kenya which suffers from chronic insecurity and both banditry and incursions by militant groups are relatively common. Earlier this week, Kenya was shaken by twin grenade attacks in the capital, Nairobi -- one at a nightclub and a second at a crowded downtown bus station during rush hour -- which left one person dead and 20 injured. A Kenyan man pleaded guilty Wednesday to being a member of the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab and was charged with causing grievous bodily harm in the bus station attack. It is not clear if Thursday's vehicle attack is linked to Monday's violence. The U.S. Embassy in Kenya warned last week it had credible information regarding an imminent terror attack, but offered no details on who might carry out such an attack. Kenya has been on edge since it sent troops across the border into Somalia nearly two weeks ago to pursue militants with Al-Shabaab, an Islamist group that the United States and other countries consider a terrorist organization. Kenya's action followed the recent abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya. It blames the abductions on Al-Shabaab, which has denied involvement. Al-Shabaab has threatened to attack Kenya if it does not withdraw its forces from Somalia.","The car was carrying government officials with school examination papers .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Japan is often called a land of contradictions, and that's why CNN correspondent Kyung Lah loves working in Tokyo. ""It's incredibly proper and restrained but then has the most outlandish behavior (at times) I've ever seen,"" Lah said. ""That contradiction means endless material for me as a news reporter."" Lah has been in Tokyo for two years, and the otherworldly feeling of living in Japan has yet to fade. ""[Visitors] will most assuredly feel like they've landed on another planet,"" she said. The mix of ancient and very stylish, modern culture is fascinating to see. ""Visitors will find an electric, hip energy all over Japan, amid an incredibly ancient world. Everything's either 400 years old or brand new,"" Lah said. CNN.com asked Lah to share some of her best tips for Tokyo visitors. Where can you get the best view of the city? Hmmm, I'd say for families, you go to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku. It's free and a great view. I'd say if you're on a date, the lobby bar at the Ritz at Tokyo Midtown or the New York Grill in Shinjuku are your best nighttime/drink/view spots. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? I'm really low-brow. ... I love Popeye's Beer Club. It's super festive and very, very fun. My hubby and I love beer. (Read a review). Where is the best place to people watch? Harajuku, by far. That's the fashion district, and you'll see some fun and hip fashions that never make it into the fashion magazines. I actually saw a woman wearing a hot pink bra as a hat. And it looked good. What is your favorite neighborhood? Shibuya. I love how young and hip it is and that it's super vibrant. I am a fan of historical Japan, but there ain't nothing like the hip lights of Shibuya to get me excited. What's the biggest misconception about your city? That it's crowded. It IS crowded, but it doesn't feel as crowded as Manhattan, because everything is so orderly. Everyone walks in an orderly manner as well! Where do you go to relax? The snowboarding slopes. I'm not much of a spa girl. I like to get out and have fun to relax. I like Gala (it's less than a hour away from Tokyo via bullet train). What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours? Tsukiji Fish Market. At 5:30 a.m., the tuna auction begins. Then eat sushi for breakfast at Daiwa Sushi Bar, and you've done one of my favorite mornings in Tokyo. What's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a ""tourist trap"" that's actually worth seeing? See above. ... Tsukiji is a tourist trap, but it's worth it. It's a little hard to get to, so you don't get too bombarded; don't sweat it too much. I'd say skip the Tokyo Tower. I have no idea why people think it's cool. Where was your most memorable meal? Daiwa Sushi in Tsukiji. Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town? Anywhere in Shibuya. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? Sushi conveyor belt meal. ... You sit by the conveyor belt and grab sushi as it rolls by. What is a good local souvenir? Temple omiyagi, which is a temple souvenir. They sell little ""good luck"" charms that are written in Japanese. They're pretty, cheap and fun.","Juxtaposition of old and new, proper and outlandish, makes Japan fascinating .

"(CNN) -- James Bond just turned 50 -- in movie years, anyhow (""Dr No"" came out in 1962) -- and in ""Skyfall"" Her Majesty's sexiest spy seems to be on the verge of a midlife crisis: He's stuck in a rut, feeling redundant and getting self-conscious about his age. He even considers early retirement, plunging to his apparent doom after he's shot in the movie's thunderously exciting pre-credit sequence. Spoiler alert: 007 survives to fight another day, but not until he's treated himself to an unofficial sabbatical, an opportunity for recuperation and introspection. Not that anyone goes to a Bond movie for navel-gazing, but there's definitely a more serious undercurrent this time around, a certain hankering after relevance that must surely be attributed to the presence of Academy Award-winning director Sam Mendes. No disrespect to Michael Apted, Lee Tamahori and the rest, but Mendes represents a step up in pedigree for a franchise that's usually been the preserve of action specialists. Photos: Becoming James Bond . Mendes is out to make more than just another Bond film, that much is clear. ""Skyfall"" features all the usual elements -- the chases, the girls, the arch villain -- but recalibrated with intelligence and a less smug, more searching sensibility. You might even detect a hint of Lester Burnham, the disenchanted, depressed 50-something played by Kevin Spacey in Mendes' ""American Beauty,"" in the disaffected and mildly disabled Bond played by Daniel Craig this time out. Returning to MI6 in its hour of greatest need, 007 can't shoot straight, fails his physical and his psych test, too. But M (Judi Dench) knows he's still the man for the job even if her latest government overseer (Ralph Fiennes) seems to think they're both relics headed for the scrapyard. Scripted by Bond specialists Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, this time with a significant assist from John Logan (""Hugo""; ""The Aviator""), ""Skyfall"" cobbles together bits and pieces from many another thriller, sometimes more loosely than we might like, and draws in particular from ""The Dark Knight"" -- but for my money Mendes gets the balance between light and dark more nearly right than Christopher Nolan managed in this year's most overbearing blockbuster. This is a movie of gleaming surfaces -- veteran DP Roger Deakins turns a glass skyscraper at night into a funhouse hall of mirrors, and a floating Macau casino is like an oasis in the black sea. After all the globetrotting, ""Skyfall"" brings the action back home to Britain -- and Deakins finds a different kind of beauty in the crags and lochs of Scotland. Just on a pictorial level, it's enticing in a way few CGI spectaculars can match. (The credit sequence alone is among the most lustrous in the entire 007 canon.) Bond girls through the years . Mendes gambles big on a last act that cuts out all the gadgets and gizmos, brings everything down to bare bones and ties the action to Bond's own history. He pulls it off, in part because this apparently immortal series desperately needed someone to take a risk, and because Mendes' class really comes through in the performances. Judi Dench is probably incapable of being bad, but M is a real character this time, with emotions, as well as convictions, and she hits every note just so. Ben Whishaw is a breath of fresh air as a youthful Q, and Craig himself remains the first 007 who might conceivably take down Sean Connery in hand-to-hand combat. Then there's Javier Bardem, one-upping even his flamboyant psychopath from ""No Country for Old Men."" The only thing banal about his villain Silva is his name. It would be a sin to say too much about this character -- discover him for yourself -- but Bardem's outrÃ© performance is simply delicious. He's a warped mama's boy who fancies himself, whisper it, Bond's mirror image. It's been a long time since I enjoyed a Bond movie so much. By taking a good hard look at itself and going back to first principles, ""Skyfall"" pulls off something quite special. This is Bond resurrected, redeemed and reinvigorated, ready to face a new half-century.","""Skyfall"" marks the 50th year of the Bond franchise .

"(CNN) -- The General Services Administration -- already under scrutiny for excessive spending -- spent $7.7 million over the past four years to transport hundreds of employees who work full-time from their homes to various government conferences and meetings across the country, according to records released this week by the federal agency. The GSA is currently reviewing its so-called ""virtual employee"" program as part of a top-down review of all of its practices. The GSA made headlines this year after a scathing inspector general's report showed that it spent $823,000 on a 2010 conference in Las Vegas. Reports and video clips of the lavish conference sparked taxpayer indignation over the wasteful spending, the resignation of the GSA's top leaders and a congressional investigation into the agency's spending practices. Since then, reports of more wasteful spending at the government agency have surfaced. GSA spends $268,000 on one-day event . GSA paid for cooking classes . Employee says GSA spent millions on relocation . The GSA released details of its virtual employee program this week acting on a request from congressional investigators. CNN also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal Freedom of Information Act. The GSA hired 379 virtual employees in an effort to save money by freeing up office space and reducing the agency's carbon footprint. Under the program, the employees were not supposed to travel excessively. But the GSA's records show that about 60% of the virtual employees traveled to conferences and meetings, mostly flying cross-country. It's not clear how the virtual employees' travel costs compare with the travel costs of other GSA employees who work at designated offices. Amid the congressional investigation, the agency has clamped down on all travel. ""Under the new GSA leadership, the agency has instituted rules to ensure that there is a strong business case for employees who work from home,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. ""It has to be cost-effective and create savings. GSA has also placed stringent controls to drastically curb spending on travel, conferences and events for all employees, including those who work from home full time."" CNN requested details of the GSA's virtual employee program after discovering that one of the employees assigned to the agency's Kansas City, Missouri, office, was working from his home in Honolulu. The business development specialist made 13 trips from Honolulu to the mainland United States in 2011 and 2012, racking up $32,694 in travel costs, according to the records. The GSA told CNN earlier this year that he had traveled nine times, with travel costs totaling $24,221. The agency's most frequent traveler was a project manager from Leawood, Kansas, who traveled to New York a total of 58 times in 2011 and 2012 at a cost of more than $99,000 to manage a construction project, the records show. The employee, who had been assigned to the GSA's office in Washington, D.C., is no longer working for the agency, and no additional details are available, a GSA spokeswoman said. The records also show that another virtual employee living in Miami and based out of the Washington, D.C., office racked up $143,881 in travel costs over four years. Another employee traveled back and forth from his home state of Washington to his District of Columbia office at a cost of $64,104. In June, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, requested details about the cost of the GSA virtual employee program. That followed disclosures that 95 virtual employees, including 12 in supervisory positions, spent nearly $750,000 in travel costs between October 2010 and June 2011. On Monday, GSA Associate Administrator Rodney Emery informed Issa that all agency officials have been given ""more guidance on when a full-time telework agreement is appropriate, how to measure potential costs or savings under development, and details on a more rigorous approval process."" The GSA said its clampdown on travel and conferences has saved $11 million over the past four months. ""Under the new leadership, travel costs for GSA employees including those who work from home is at its lowest in four years,"" the agency said. ""With stringent spending controls in place, the agency expects to realize millions more savings."" The General Services Administration, which has more than 12,600 employees and a $26.3 billion budget, is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non-military procurement.

"New York (CNN) -- Stores across the Northeast were packed with shoppers as people prepared for what could be a historic blizzard set to arrive on Friday. In Reading, Massachusetts, residents were preparing for several feet of snow that could leave them stuck in their homes for days. ""It's a zoo in there. There's nothing left on the shelves. ... I think I got every bottle of water that they had in stock,"" Elizabeth Fraiser told CNN afilliate WHDH. At the Home Depot, another resident said she had essential supplies but wanted to be doubly sure she was ready. ""I have a lot of it, but just want to be prepared. You never know,"" Joanna Spinosa said. A picture posted on the website of CNN affiliate WCVB showed long lines at a gas station in Boston. Travelers looking up flight details on airline websites were seeing the word ""Canceled"" over and over. And it wasn't just affecting travelers in the Northeast. Nearly 3,300 flights were canceled in anticipation of the storm as emergency crews geared up for inclement weather, most of which was expected late Friday into Saturday. According to the flight-tracking website Flight Aware, airports from Logan in Boston to O'Hare in Chicago to Reagan National in Washington were seeing significant number of flights -- inbound and outbound -- called off for Friday. More than 60 U.S. airports reported flight cancellations, Flight Aware said. Amtrak canceled many trips in the Northeast corridor. The rail transit company said on its website that northbound service from New York's Penn Station would be suspended after 1 p.m Friday. Two ferocious storm systems are expected to converge across the Northeast on Friday and spawn nightmares for a large swath of the country. A wintry blast churning across the nation and a cold front barreling up the East Coast will unite and could dump as much as a foot of snow in New York and up to 3 feet in Boston. Boston could see snowfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour, as frigid gusts swirl across the region. The system has already drawn comparisons to the ""Great Blizzard"" of 1978, when thousands were stranded as fast-moving snow drifts blanketed highways and left several people dead. The most severe weather is expected to hit Massachusetts between 2 and 5 p.m. on Friday. Gov. Deval Patrick announced Thursday that all non-emergency workers should work from home. He canceled all school classes on Friday. ""Be a good neighbor. Check on the elderly,"" he said, advising residents not to bring portable stoves, charcoal or gas grill indoors out of concern for potential fire hazards or carbon monoxide poisoning. All vehicles must be off the roads by noon on Friday, and Boston's public rail system will halt service at 3:30 p.m. A fleet of 600 snow removers will be manned by municipal workers and contractors as authorities gear up for what they say could be a 36-hour storm. ""We are hearty New Englanders and used to these kinds of storms, but I also want to remind people to use common sense and stay off the streets,"" said Mayor Thomas M. Menino. Forecasters warned of potential white-out conditions across New England and parts of New York. ""If you are on the highway and you are stuck, you are putting yourself in danger,"" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. Meanwhile, residents stocked up after authorities announced that public schools across several New England states would not hold classes Friday. ""They're coming in buying shovels, ice melts and sleds,"" said Atton Shipman, who works at Back Bay Hardware in Boston. Social media was abuzz with chatter about the incoming weather. ""Just a reminder of what the ground looks like in case anyone forgets in a couple of days,"" tweeted Ryan Pickering, after posting a close-up photo of a Rhode Island roadway. Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency officials said that they were busy salting roadways. ""Travel may become nearly impossible with blowing/drifting snow and near zero visibility during the height of the storm (Friday afternoon into Saturday morning),"" the agency said in a statement. ""Motorized vehicles are asked to stay off the roads if they can during the storm to allow snow plows to clear the roads."" Crews began preparing snow plows at Logan International Airport, where officials said the storm is expected to cause more flight delays and cancellations. United Airlines said customers in storm-affected cities will be allowed to reschedule their itineraries ""with a one-time date or time change, and the airline will waive the change fees."" Delta, Jet Blue, Southwest and other airlines offered their customers similar assurances. In Connecticut, Gov. Dannel Malloy said utility companies were bringing additional crews from out of state to deal with potential power outages. Metro-North rail lines could also be closed at any time should winds exceed 40 mph. The Connecticut National Guard has moved equipment to staging places, including several Black Hawk helicopters at Bradley International Airport north of Hartford. In Rhode Island, 300 members of a military police brigade were scheduled to drill on Saturday and Sunday but the drill has been moved up because of the storm. A snow emergency went into effect in the southern Connecticut city of Stamford, beginning at 5 p.m. In New York, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the timing of the storm could actually benefit municipal workers. ""If it's going to happen, having it happen Friday overnight into Saturday is probably as good timing as we could have,"" Bloomberg said. ""The sanitation department then has the advantage of being able to clean the streets when there's normally less traffic."" New York's Air National Guard unit on Long Island has some snowmobiles it can deploy to help with search and rescue or emergency transportation. If Gov. Andrew Cuomo were to order the National Guard to assist, each of New York's Guard's six operating areas will be ready to deploy 10 Humvees and 40 troops trained in disaster response. By late Thursday, the National Weather Service had issued a blizzard warning from 6 a.m. Friday until 1 p.m. Saturday, with wind gusts up to 50 mph, creating dangerous driving conditions with visibilities near zero in white-out conditions. Consolidated Edison, a main utility company for the New York region, said it is preparing additional crews to deal with potential power outages and advised customers to stay clear of downed power lines. Long island Power Authority, which received intense criticism over its handling of Superstorm Sandy, said it was preparing. Record-breaking snowfall could hit Hartford, Connecticut, as well. ""We expect snow and then rain, and severe coastal flooding,"" said CNN meteorologist Sarah Dillingham. Wind will also be a major concern. Gusts could reach 75 mph along Cape Cod and 55 mph in the Long Island Sound and cause coastal flooding, with tides rising about three to five feet. As more miserable weather slams the region, those affected by Superstorm Sandy will be further hampered by high winds, cold temperatures and more beach erosion. Parts of the region are under a blizzard watch. In New Hampshire, there are people who actually want a lot of snow. ""Natural snow definitely gets people to remind them that there are winter activities,"" Lori Rowell, director of marketing for Pats Peak ski resort in Henniker, told CNN affiliate WBZ. Steve Livingston said he usually sells 30 to 35 snowmobiles a week at his shop, but he hasn't sold any in the past week. Sales have been super slow,"" said Livingston, owner of Livingston's Arctic Cat in Hillsborough. ""I hope we get as much snow as we can possibly deal with. That would be like a hot summer day for Hampton Beach for us."" CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Shoppers pack stores, gas station lines before it begins to snow .

"Washington (CNN) -- If President Obama decides to send the 40,000 additional forces to Afghanistan as requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a rough estimate by the Pentagon projects the cost could be an additional $20 billion a year, according to a senior Pentagon official. The official said the Defense Department comptrollers office has told Congress that based on rough estimates, the total cost of keeping an individual service member in the war zone is now about $500,000 a year. That includes the costs of personnel operations and maintenance costs, some equipment and hazardous duty pay. The actual costs could be higher, because the estimate does not include the cost of constructing additional facilities, providing support forces such as military intelligence assets that may be based outside Afghanistan or replacing damaged weapons or equipment. The official emphasized that until there is a formal troop plan, the costs are just estimated. The official would not be identified because the estimates are not official. The ongoing review of the strategy for Afghanistan continued Friday, with Obama meeting with Defense Secretary Robert Gates; Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the heads of the four military services. The heads of the Army and Marines, who provide the bulk of troops for the war, have expressed concern that if they send a large number of additional troops, they will have to cut down on the time troops spend in between deployments, known as ""dwell time."" Marines have only about 8,000 troops they can add without impinging on dwell time. The Army has about 12 brigades, or approximately 48,000 soldiers, that are not deployed or committed to deploy. Regardless of the number of troops being sent, a deployment will be phased over time because of the lack of facilities in the country to house and support a large deployment, the official said. McChrystal's plan calls for sending a majority of the forces he is requesting to the south, especially to reinforce Kandahar and Helmand provinces, and the region around Kabul, several military and Pentagon sources said. McChrystal also intends to reserve a number of forces for training Afghan forces, officials said. But one official noted that if that plan is put into effect, additional forces would be needed to be sent to areas that the Taliban might then flee, such as the northern region.","Pentagon official says estimate puts cost of adding 40,000 troops at $20 billion a year .

"(CNN) -- When Gérard Depardieu triggered a fiscal feud with the French government a few weeks ago, the media had fun recasting him in his movie role as the comic book character Obélix, a fat and superhumanly strong Gaulois who stands up to the Romans. Now that the French movie star has abandoned the land of the Gauls to become a Russian citizen, his recent film role as the mad monk Rasputin is being evoked to put a cinematic image on a bizarre real-life drama that has become an affair of state. Depardieu's ""defection"" to Russia has both amused and angered his compatriots. The actor has not helped matters with his puzzling public statements. Depardieu, whose father was a communist, praised Russia as a ""great democracy,"" a description open to some debate given that country's history. Over the weekend, Depardieu made a visit to Russia that was splashed all over the media in Russia -- and was the first item on the French evening news on Sunday. French television viewers watched footage of Depardieu defend Vladimir Putin and proudly brandish his new Russian passport. Depardieu's love for Russia cannot be indifferent to the country's flat 13% income tax rate, measurably lower than the 75% rate that France's socialist government will impose this year on income over a million euros. Depardieu, whose personal fortune is estimated at $200 million, at first bolted for Belgium to escape the tax. Now he has accepted the warm embrace of his friend Putin. France's constitutional court overturned the ""supertax"" on the rich, but the Socialist government intends to push forward with the measure. Depardieu said he admires Russia for its history and great artists. Yet his affection for the Slavic world has not been without controversy. He is a friend of Ramzan Kadyrov, the autocratic president of the Russian republic of Chechnya who has invited other Western stars such as Jean-Claude Van Damme and Hilary Swank to his birthday parties to flatter his over-sized self-image. More bizarrely, Depardieu recorded a duet titled ""Nebo Molchit"" with the glamorous Gulnara Karimova -- known as ""Googoosha"" -- daughter of Uzbekistan's autocratic ruler Islam Karimov. His critics in France look upon Depardieu's posturing as the latest misadventure in the actor's turbulent life. Recently, he was arrested and jailed for driving his scooter through Paris in a state of intoxication. He was also kicked off an airplane in Dublin for relieving himself on board. A man of gargantuan appetites referred to affectionately in France as ""Gégé"", Depardieu is a larger-than-life figure whose recent travails have highlighted deep tensions in French society. Depardieu is not the only fabulously wealthy citizen to leave France to escape the country's punishing income taxes. In the past, French rocks stars such as Johnny Hallyday and tennis players such as Yannick Noah have attracted criticism for moving to Switzerland. Tax exile is frowned on in France, a country where fiscal obligation is considered a gesture of loyalty to the French nation. Opinion: Why Depardieu's 'pathetic' desertion has caused French storm . France is also a traditionally Catholic culture suspicious of money and hostile toward the wealthy. French president Francois Hollande declared publicly during last year's election campaign: ""I don't like the rich."" In French politics that kind of declaration resonates with voters. The French are cynical about their elites in general, and hostile toward the rich in particular. In the late 17th century, Louis XIV infamously expelled nearly a million Protestants who at that time were a rich and powerful minority active in banking and finance. Today France's billionaires, such as L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, tend to stay discreetly out of view and lack the same spirit of charity found in America. France has no Warren Buffet or Bill Gates. The super-rich in France give money to politicians, not to charities. Depardieu may be a hugely popular movie actor in France, but when he put his sumptuous digs in the fashionable Saint-Germain-des-Prés section of Paris on the market for nearly $66 million it reminded the French that he belongs to a different universe. Even more controversial is Depardieu's choice to become a Russian citizen, which is an open gesture of defiance and rejection toward the French nation. France is a country whose mythology of ""national identity"" is deeply entrenched in the collective psyche. The notion of the ""French exception"" reinforces the idea that France is different and can resort to extraordinary means to protect its national identity, usually by heavy state intervention. In France, citizenship is cherished, something that foreigners aspire to. When one of France's most famous and loved movie stars hands back his passport and flounces out of the national family, it can be interpreted as an act of betrayal. Many of Depardieu's critics in France have preferred to use the language of sarcasm, dismissing him as a troubled figure out of touch with the realities of his fellow countrymen. The French newspaper Le Monde pointed out that Russian commentators are saying that Depardieu is being naively exploited by Putin. The Russian leader, they argue, is using the Depardieu saga as a PR exercise for internal purposes. Depardieu has been seen knocking about his familiar precincts on the Left Bank of Paris. When he leaves the country, he will have to return next time showing a Russian passport. Meanwhile, the French film starring Depardieu as Rasputin still has not been released in his new Russian homeland. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matthew Fraser.","Gérard Depardieu is granted Russian citizenship by Vladimir Putin .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Two bomb blasts killed at least 15 people and wounded 119 others on Thursday in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, the city's police commissioner, Anurag Sharma, said a day after the attack. Sharma didn't rule out the possibility of terror involvement in the city blasts. But he refused to identity any group as a suspect. The two bombs were planted on bicycles parked in a crowded spot, Sharma said. They were improvised explosive devices, he said, and they could have been triggered by a timer. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the strike a ""dastardly attack"" and said ""the guilty will not go unpunished."" He directed government agencies to extend all possible relief to authorities in Andhra Pradesh state. He also approved money for the next of kin of those killed and for others seriously injured.","Two bomb blasts killed at least 15 people and wounded 119 others in Hyderabad .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- The suspect in Friday's shooting of six people in a downtown high-rise is a 40-year-old man with economic woes that include a recent bankruptcy filing, federal records show. In his filing last May for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, under which he sought to have his assets liquidated and his debts discharged, Jason S. Rodriguez listed his assets at $4,675 and his liabilities at $89,873.31. His 2002 Nissan XTerra with 110,000 miles represented $4,000 of those assets. His personal property filing described the vehicle as having body damage on the right side, an air conditioner that did not work and a transmission that was slipping. He said his monthly income as a ""sandwich artist"" at a Subway Restaurant in Orlando, where he had worked for nine months, was $890.67, and he listed his monthly expenses at $815. A man who answered the phone at the restaurant referred a caller to company headquarters, where spokesman Kevin Kane confirmed that Rodriguez had worked for the company, but left six weeks ago. Kane said the company has a job title of ""sandwich artist."" Before leaving Subway, Rodriguez's income had already taken a hit, dropping from $27,686 in 2007 to $13,936 in 2008. Rodriguez estimated the value of his household goods -- a TV, microwave, bed, computer, dresser, two night stands, etc. -- at $500 and said his girlfriend owned the remaining household goods. He faced an $11,085 claim of child support. In addition, he was behind on his rent ($1,402.05), owed $450 to American Express, $110 to AT&T for his cell phone service and $343 to Florida Hospital Orlando for unspecified medical services, the document said. Among his creditors were the Internal Revenue Service for unpaid 2005 and 2006 taxes totaling $2,415. The largest debts were for student loans -- $8,500 to Wachovia, $28,912 to Sallie Mae. Orlando lawyer Charlie Price represented Rodriguez in his case. ""It's not that atypical from most everyone I see,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""That's how it is right now. He's a very typical client. Of people that are suffering through the economy right now, there's nothing extraordinary about him ... except that."" Price said he had had no contact with Rodriguez for several months, and added that his former client did not owe him money.","In bankruptcy filing, Jason S.

"(CNN) -- To the surprise of many, including me, President Barack Obama has nominated former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel to be his next defense secretary. Like many Texans, I am grateful for Hagel's courageous military service, but I fear he is the wrong man to lead the Pentagon. One of the biggest foreign-policy challenges of Obama's second term is preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons -- which means we need a defense secretary who understands the nature and magnitude of the Iranian threat. Based on his record, Hagel does not. In July 2001, 96 U.S. senators voted to extend sanctions against Iran. Chuck Hagel was one of only two senators who voted against sanctions. A year later, he urged the Bush administration to support Iranian membership in the World Trade Organization. Even more disturbing, Hagel voted against a 2007 measure that called for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to be designated a terrorist group. (At the time, the IRGC was aiding and equipping Shiite militias that were murdering U.S. troops in Iraq.) A few weeks after this vote, Hagel  sent a letter to President George W. Bush asking him to launch ""direct, unconditional, and comprehensive talks"" with the Iranian government, which the State Department has labeled a state sponsor of terrorism every year since 1984. In July 2008, Hagel recommended that Washington go beyond direct talks and establish a U.S. diplomatic mission in Tehran. Later that month, in a Senate Banking Committee vote, he was one of only two senators to oppose the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act. (Obama signed a subsequent version of this bill in July 2010.) Finally, in his 2008 book, ""America: Our Next Chapter,"" Hagel appeared to suggest that the United States could live with a nuclear Iran, writing that ""the genie of nuclear armaments is already out of the bottle, no matter what Iran does."" These comments and actions indicate that he does not fully appreciate the dangers of a nuclear Iran or the character of the Iranian regime. It is a regime that has effectively been at war with the United States since 1979 -- a regime whose proxies (such as the terrorist group Hezbollah) have killed Americans in Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. For that matter, Tehran was recently implicated in a plot to blow up a restaurant (and the Saudi ambassador) in our nation's capital. This is not a government that calculates self-interest the way America does. It is a messianic theocracy intent on exporting its violent Islamist revolution. And if Tehran gets the bomb, we might soon have a nuclear arms race in one of the world's most volatile regions. It is no exaggeration to say that a nuclear Iran represents an existential threat to Israel. And yet, while Hagel wants us to be softer on the Iranians, he thinks we should be tougher on the Israelis. In October 2000, at the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada, he was one of only four senators who refused to sign a letter to President Bill Clinton affirming U.S. solidarity with Israel. More recently, in January 2009, Hagel signed a letter advising Obama to spearhead direct, unconditional talks with Hamas, a terrorist group that had just fired hundreds of rockets into Israel. Lest we forget, Hamas is an Iranian proxy whose senior leaders openly pray for genocidal violence against both Israelis and Americans. Last year, for example, a Hamas official named Ahmad Bahr, who serves as deputy speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, declared in a sermon, ""Oh Allah, destroy the Jews and their supporters. Oh Allah, destroy the Americans and their supporters. Oh Allah, count them one by one, and kill them all, without leaving a single one."" Thus, by nominating Hagel for defense secretary, the president has sent the worst possible message to our closest Middle Eastern ally and our greatest Middle Eastern enemy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Cornyn.","John Cornyn: Obama's defense secretary nominee, Chuck Hagel, is wrong for the job .

"(CNN) -- An intense typhoon made landfall in the southern Philippines early Tuesday amid fears that it could be worse than a 2011 storm that killed more than 1,200 people. Typhoon Bopha struck the southern island of Mindanao shortly before 4:45 a.m. (3:45 p.m. Monday ET), the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Center reported. The storm packed top winds of 175 kph (110 mph) as it came ashore over the city of Baganga, and millions of people -- many of whom live in remote and unprepared communities -- were in the storm's path, Philippine authorities and aid groups said. The tightly packed but powerful storm threatened to bring devastating flash floods and landslides. High winds could blast some homes into sticks, uproot trees and cut power for days, government officials warned. The storm weakened slightly as it moved west across Mindanao during the course of the morning, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The storm, dubbed ""Pablo"" in the Philippines, had blown up into a super typhoon at one point Monday, with sustained winds greater than 240 kph -- the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported. That wind speed is two and a half times the top winds of Severe Tropical Storm Washi, known in the Philippines as Sendong, whose heavy rains set off landslides that swept away entire villages in the same region a year ago. ""Many emotional people in (Mindanao) trying to prepare for Pablo with Sendong fresh in their minds,"" Carin van der Hor, the Philippines director for the children's charity Plan International, wrote Monday on Twitter. In the fishing village of Hinatuan, officials had warned coastal and island residents to evacuate to government shelters in the final hours before the storm hit, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported. At sea near the storm, waves reached as high as 52 feet, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. On land, the outer bands of the storm had already begun to bring intense rain and high winds to coastal communities before landfall was made, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Government agencies had moved millions of dollars worth of relief supplies into position for quick delivery to storm-hit regions and put emergency crews, the military and hospitals on standby. School classes were suspended in many cities, and at least 80 flights were canceled, according to the disaster agency. The threat to Mindanao comes just weeks ahead of the first anniversary of Washi, whose heavy rains set off flash floods in the middle of the night that swept away entire villages. More than 1,200 people died and hundreds of thousands were left homeless, prompting a humanitarian crisis. Stormy weather in recent months also has caused death and destruction in other areas of the Philippines, where poor infrastructure leaves many communities highly vulnerable. Severe flooding in the region of the capital, Manila, killed more than 80 people in August. And Tropical Cyclone Son-Tinh left at least 27 people dead after sweeping across the central Philippines in October. Palau, a tiny island nation roughly 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Mindanao, had a close shave with Bopha as the typhoon churned past, catching some outlying parts of the archipelago. ""It was headed right toward Palau,"" said Derek Williams, a meteorologist for the U.S. National Weather Service in Guam. But at the last minute, ""it just turned to the west and fortunately went south of them,"" he said. ""I really think they escaped the brunt of the storm,"" Williams said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, noting that Palau doesn't usually get hit by strong typhoons. Bopha nonetheless brought down a lot of trees and caused widespread power outages in Palau, according to Williams. ""The fast movement of the system really prevented a lot of flooding,"" he said. ""I think probably only a few inches of rain fell, so that's certainly good news, because Palau itself is susceptible to mudslides."" CNN's Michael Pearson reported from Atlanta and CNN's Jethro Mullen reported from Hong Kong.","NEW: Typhoon Bopha weakens slightly as it moves across Mindanao .

"(CNN) -- A couple of weeks ago, Micha Rahder got a disturbing letter. It said that she no longer had health insurance -- and was required to as a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The problem was -- it was her own school's insurance policy that was dropping her. Rahder, 30, was losing insurance because she had reached the lifetime limit of coverage under the University of California's student health insurance plan. She suffers from a rare disorder that requires her to get regular and expensive IV treatments every four weeks. Without treatment for her chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy -- a disease that attacks her nervous system -- she has lost the ability to walk and has had to have a guest lecturer come in to teach her class. She said she can't understand why she's in this predicament. ""I initially thought Obamacare would take care of this, but somehow these schools have slipped out of it. I'm extremely frustrated,"" Rahder said. ""Most people didn't know I was sick until this happened, and when I tell them why I'm sick, they can't believe it."" Had she been insured elsewhere, she might have been protected from losing her health care coverage. Under the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act, or ACA, lifetime limits are supposed to be a thing of the past. But there are about 30 schools in the country, mostly in California and the Ivy League system, that offer students what is called self-funded student health insurance. Instead of using an insurance company, a university runs the program, and student premiums directly pay for it. Experts say it's a complicated system to run, but it's ultimately a lot cheaper for a school, because it eliminates the middleman of an insurance company. Obamacare: A few changes coming in 2013 . About 300,000 students are covered by these plans. A proposed ruling issued by the Obama administration Wednesday determined these plans do count as ""minimum essential coverage"" but exempts them from having to meet the same standards of other health coverage. (The Department of Health and Human Services offers a 60-day period for public comments after publication in the Federal Register before issuing a final ruling.) The proposed rule means self-funded student health care plans can continue to cap benefits like they did in Rahder's case. Those self-funded student plans are the only insurance-type programs in the country that don't have to provide the consumer protections guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act. ""That's because they aren't really insurance plans,"" said Steven M. Bloom, director of federal relations, government and public affairs at the American Council on Education, a group that represents the presidents of the nation's higher education institutions. ""They are not sold by an insurer. Only students can buy the plans, and the schools pay for them. I know it acts like insurance, but under the law it is not technically insurance. ""That's a very lawyer-like explanation, isn't it? But that's what the law says,"" Bloom said. Early in the discussion about these particular plans, HHS didn't think it had the power to regulate them, Bloom said. ""In order for these plans to have to follow the ACA, the regulations would probably have to change."" Jen Mishory, a lawyer and deputy director of the Young Invincibles, an advocacy group for young people, said, ""They are certainly advertised to students as health insurance plans, and they are called insurance plans when you sign up for them. Yes, there is a legal distinction here, but a legal technicality shouldn't shortchange students like this."" Mishory added, ""Students do tend to be healthier than the general population, but there are occasions when a student gets sick. We want all students to have the same coverage everyone else has."" About 50 University of California, Berkeley students organized a rally in October to call for elimination of the lifetime caps on their student health insurance plans, and they're circulating a petition. Other schools in California are planning similar protests, Rahder said. Eliminating the caps could add expense to the programs though. And universities, in tight budgetary times, may not want to increase the cost. ""Universities are big businesses. People sometimes forget that when they see the tweed and the elbow patches,"" said Dr. Bryan Liang, a lawyer and physician who specializes in health care law and teaches at California Western School of Law in San Diego. ""But this is about profit, and these schools aren't insulated from the economic realities. If there is a way to lower costs, they will do what they can."" Opinion: 'Obamacare' should be a GOP rallying cry . In reading the Obama administration's proposed rule from Wednesday, Liang said he does believe HHS will continue to watch the situation carefully. ""They don't want anyone to have to go back to the old system,"" he said. Bloom added that these self-funded plans do generally offer good health coverage. ""I don't think you are seeing some kind of conspiracy in the way that the statutes are written. These plans are very comprehensive,"" Bloom said. ""It doesn't mean it's not a tragedy if a student is in that situation where they come up against the caps, but in the grand scheme of things, this is a very small percentage of students that this impacts. You are talking about a fly on an elephant here."" But it's big issue to Rahder, who cannot walk at the moment because she can't afford the treatment she needs without insurance. For now, she said she may have found an alternative insurance. It's more expensive, but her mom will help with the bills. Once she gets the treatment and can walk again, she said she will be out there protesting so other students won't experience what she did. ""I mean, what is health insurance for if not to catch you in those rare cases when you do get sick?"" she asked. ""This seems outrageous and is really truly mind-boggling.""","A proposal says self-funded college health plans count as ""minimum essential coverage""

"Washington (CNN) -- A comprehensive bill on veterans affairs awaiting President Barack Obama's signature includes provisions that would expand restrictions on protests at military funerals such as those carried out by Westboro Baptist Church of Kansas. Under the ""Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012,"" which won final congressional approval Tuesday, protesters must be at least 300 feet from military funerals from two hours before they start until two hours after they end. Violators could face unspecified fines and up to two years in prison. The Kansas church has attracted nationwide attention for its angry, anti-gay protests at the funerals of U.S. military members. 2011: Counter-protesters confront Westboro Baptist Church at Arlington . It won an appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court last year in a case that tested the competing constitutional rights of free speech and privacy. There was no immediate response Thursday to a CNN e-mail to the Westboro Baptist Church seeking comment. Led by pastor Fred Phelps, the church believes God is punishing the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality"" through events including soldiers' deaths. Members have traveled the country shouting at grieving families at funerals and displaying such signs as ""Thank God for dead soldiers,"" ""God blew up the troops"" and ""AIDS cures fags."" According to the church website, they will continue protesting at military funerals. It was unclear whether enactment of the new law would change the church's plans or whether the church would mount a legal challenge against it. The new restrictions expand on provisions in a federal law passed in 2006 that banned protests within 300 feet of national cemeteries from an hour before a funeral to an hour after it, with violators facing fines and up to a year in prison. The Supreme Court case involved a protest by Westboro members outside the 2006 funeral for Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder in Westminster, Maryland, near Baltimore. Snyder's family sued the church in 2007, alleging invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy. A jury awarded the family $2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $8 million in punitive damages, which were later reduced to $5 million. The church appealed the case in 2008 to a federal appeals court, which reversed the judgments a year later, siding with the church's allegations that its First Amendment rights were violated. The case then went to the Supreme Court, which issued a narrow ruling based on the facts of the specific appeal. By an 8-1 vote, the high court said members of Westboro Baptist Church had a right to promote what they call a broad-based message on public matters such as wars. A majority of states across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the Westboro church protesters. 2011: Army veteran pleads to misdemeanors in Westboro stalking case . Church members say their broader message is aimed at the unspecified actions of the military and those who serve in it. They believe U.S. soldiers deserve to die because they fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality. The congregation is made up mostly of Fred Phelps and his family. The pastor has 13 children, and at least 54 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He described himself as an ""old-time"" gospel preacher in a CNN interview in 2006, saying, ""You can't preach the Bible without preaching the hatred of God."" 2011: Foo Fighters protest Westboro Baptist Church .

"London (CNN) -- A Europe-wide scandal over horse meat in products labeled beef spread still further Friday, as UK authorities revealed the results of DNA testing on beef products and raided the premises of three more UK food firms. Of 2,501 tests carried out on beef products across the industry by noon Friday, 2,472 found no horse meat content above 1%, the UK Food Standards Agency said. The 29 positive tests involved seven products sold by five suppliers, according to the Food Standards Agency. Another 962 tests are still under way, the agency said at a news conference. Fifteen of the positive tests were for the lasagna products sold by frozen food giant Findus that first triggered the horse meat alert last week. The others concerned beef products sold by supermarket chains Tesco, Aldi and The Co-operative, and burgers made by catering supplier Rangeland. Tesco, Asda and Aldi all issued statements saying they are boosting testing on meat products to protect customers, restore confidence and ensure product quality. Jim Smith, group technical director for Tesco, said the company will ""no longer work with the suppliers who fell below our very high standards."" The Food Standards Agency declined to give details of the names or location of the three food premises raided Friday. Investigations are ongoing, but authorities cannot rule out the possibility of arrests, it said. The latest raids come a day after UK authorities arrested three workers at two meat plants, Farmbox Meats near Aberystywth and Peter Boddy Slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Inspectors toured the plants Tuesday and suspended their permits to operate Wednesday, the agency said. Meanwhile, authorities in northern England confirmed Friday that a dish had been pulled from 47 school kitchens after tests revealed horse DNA. The ready-made cottage pie, or shepherd's pie, came from an external supplier, the Lancashire County Council said. ""This does not appear to be a food safety issue but I've no doubt parents will agree we need to take a very firm line with suppliers,"" councilor Susie Charles said in a prepared statement. Authorities across Europe have been scrambling to get a grip on the crisis over rogue horse meat in beef products. Fears of mislabeled meat also spread to the sky, where companies that provide in-flight catering in Europe initiated reviews of their suppliers. LSG Sky Chefs said it has contacted all its meat suppliers in Europe and has asked for written confirmation that their products do not contain horse meat. Another major caterer, Gate Gourmet, is doing the same with its suppliers. The European Union intends to begin testing meat across all 27 member states, it confirmed Friday. It called for testing 10 to 150 samples per country and at least five tests per country for the presence of the drug phenylbutazone, also known as bute, which is approved for horses but is not allowed to enter the food chain because it can be harmful to humans. Over the past week, unauthorized horse meat has been discovered in a variety of products labeled as beef that were sold in supermarkets in countries including Britain, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany and Ireland. In the UK, catering giant Compass Group and Whitbread, which owns hotels, coffee shops and restaurants, were the latest to say Friday that they had found horse DNA in certain beef products. Whitbread said it was removing a meat lasagna and a beef burger from its menus and would work with the Food Standards Agency to implement a robust future testing regime. ""We are shocked and disappointed at this failure of the processed meat supply chain,"" it said in a written statement. Compass Group said an affected burger from Rangeland Foods had been provided to some sites in Ireland and Northern Ireland where it holds the catering contract. It promised DNA testing across processed meat products in future. NorgesGruppen in Norway also confirmed to CNN on Friday that horse meat had been found in frozen lasagna dishes in its stores. ""The analysis tells us that the lasagnas contained 60% or more horse meat,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We have withdrawn up to 8,000 products last week. We are in talks with the factory, the French company Comigel."" Comigel was one of two French firms whose role in the scandal was highlighted at a news conference held by French authorities Thursday. The other firm, Spanghero, should have known that the meat it labeled as beef was actually horse, French Consumer Affairs Minister Benoit Hamon said. Spanghero was the first company to label the meat as beef, the minister said, adding that 750 tons of horse meat were involved over a period of at least six months. Spanghero should have identified the meat as horse from its Romanian customs code, as well as its appearance, smell and price, he said. Comigel also should have noticed anomalies in labeling of the meat it received, Hamon said. A Spanghero representative told CNN the company had acted in good faith. ""The company has never ordered horse meat and we never knowingly sold horse meat,"" the representative said. The affair has been passed to the Paris prosecutor to be investigated as fraud, Hamon said. The offense is punishable by up to two years in prison and fines of up to â‚¬187,500 for the companies involved. Hamon said there is no reason to doubt that the Romanian abattoir that supplied the horse meat was acting in good faith. In another twist, UK inspectors said Thursday that horse carcasses contaminated with the equine painkiller bute may have entered the food chain in France. UK and French authorities are working to trace the horse meat, the Food Standards Agency said. The meat industry was first thrust into the spotlight last month when Irish investigators found horse and pig DNA in hamburger products. The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products. Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horse meat. CNN's Claudia Rebaza, Kendra Wates and Susannah Palk contributed to this report.","UK inspectors report 29 beef products test positive for horse meat out of 2,501 sampled .

"(CNN) -- At the age of 47, boxing legend Evander Holyfield is still hoping to become the world heavyweight champion for a record fifth time. The American, who famously defeated Mike Tyson in 1996 to win the WBA title before having part of his ear bitten off in the rematch, extended his illustrious career into a fourth decade when he beat fellow veteran Francois Botha in Las Vegas to claim the little-regarded WBF crown. While current WBA champion David Haye of Britain is expected to face one of the title-holding Klitschko brothers -- IBF/WBO king Wladimir or WBC champion Vitali -- in his next fight, Holyfield has staked his claim to be considered as a future challenger. ""I'm going to be the undisputed world heavyweight champion,"" he told reporters after beating his 41-year-old South African opponent, who lost on points in his second defense of the title in front of a small crowd of about 3,000 people on Saturday night. Holyfield's last bid at a recognized heavyweight title saw him defeated on points by giant Russian Nikolai Valuev in a WBA bout in 2008. ""I've been telling people since 1992 when I lost to Riddick Bowe that I was going to be undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. I won two but not the third,"" he said. ""Botha gave me an opportunity. People talk about my legacy. It's about who you've fought. They can't deny me -- I fight the best. I always want to fight somebody to get a little credit if I beat them."" Holyfield, an Olympic bronze medallist who won his first professional fight in 1984, said that he would ignore critics who said he was too old to be taken seriously. ""This is a new era and I didn't think I'd be in it,"" he said. ""I was laughing a little when I fought George Foreman [in 1991]. He was 42 and I was 29. I really didn't want to fight him. ""He didn't beat me but he did become world champion again. What I learned from that fight was George said it wasn't about age but that I will give my all. ""You can't let people tell you what you can do. I fight because I want to. I wouldn't be the person I am without opportunities.""

"(CNN) -- An Idaho man accused of uttering a racial slur and slapping a crying 19-month-old boy on a Delta Air Lines flight turned himself in to authorities Tuesday. Joe Rickey Hundley of Hayden, Idaho, surrendered in that state, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta. He was charged with assaulting a minor, stemming from a February 8 incident aboard the Delta flight to Atlanta. Hundley was released on bail. His attorney, Marcia Shein, has said her client is being unfairly portrayed. ""This has escalated into a racist issue and I want to be clear he is not a racist,"" Shein said. Will the slap heard 'round the country have lasting effects? She also said that Hundley is dealing with unspecified issues. According to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta last week, the boy's mother, Jessica Bennett, 33, of Minnesota and her son were seated in Row 28, Seat B on Delta Flight 721 that originated in Minneapolis. She spent part of the flight in the rear of the plane to get away from Hundley, who she said smelled like alcohol and was slurring his speech, according to John Thompson, the attorney for the child's family. As the plane began its descent into Atlanta, the boy began to cry because of the altitude change and his mother tried to soothe him. Hundley, who was seated next to the mother and son, allegedly told her to ""shut that (N-word) baby up."" Hundley then turned around and slapped the child in the face with an open hand, which caused him to scream even louder, an FBI affidavit said. The boy suffered a scratch below his right eye. Other passengers on the plane assisted Bennett, and one of them heard the slur and witnessed the alleged assault, the affidavit said. Shein said that even if her client did use the slur, it does not make him a racist.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- U.S. officials in Kenya have warned of an ""imminent threat"" of a terror attack on Mombasa and urged Americans to leave the port city. Mombasa, the second-largest city and a major tourist spot for the East African nation, is one of various cities targeted by a series of grenade attacks in recent months. The U.S. Embassy in the capital, Nairobi, said it has suspended all U.S. government travel to Mombasa until July 1. In Kenya, Ida Odinga is not your average politician's wife . ""All U.S. government personnel are required to leave Mombasa,"" the embassy said in a statement Friday. ""U.S. private citizens are not subject to the same restrictions, but should consider this information in their travel planning."" The warning did not elaborate on the threat or why it targeted the port city. Kenyan forces invaded southern Somalia in October to battle Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, which it blamed for attacks and kidnappings of foreigners in the nation. The terror group has threatened Kenya with retaliatory attacks, saying it considers the forces' incursion an affront to Somalia's sovereignty. Since the invasion, Kenya has been targeted by a series of grenade attacks blamed on the terror group or its supporters. Al-Shabaab is linked to al Qaeda and has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States.

"Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- Health officials continued on Monday to investigate the causes behind the mysterious deaths of 64 children in Cambodia after saying they had made an important discovery over the weekend. The Institut Pasteur in Cambodia tested samples taken from 24 patients and found 15 had tested positive for Enterovirus Type 71 -- a common cause of hand, foot and mouth disease that can also cause severe neurological complications, mainly in children. ""These results now give a good explanation to this outbreak,"" Dr. Philippe Buchy, head of the institute's virology unit, said in an e-mail over the weekend. ""We will get more results hopefully by next Tuesday or Wednesday."" The World Health Organization also noted that a ""significant proportion of the samples"" had tested positive for EV71, but it cautioned that the outbreak had not been fully solved, and more analysis was needed. Outbreaks of the enterovirus ""occur periodically in the Asia-Pacific region,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Brunei had its first major outbreak in 2006. China had an outbreak in 2008. Though the detection of EV71 in Cambodia is significant, there may be other factors, said Dr. Beat Richner of Kantha Bopha hospitals. Over the past three months, 66 children -- between 2 and 3 years old -- were admitted to Kantha Bopha facilities. All but two died mysteriously after suffering severe neurological and respiratory complications, Richner said. In their last hours of their life, the children experienced a ""total destruction of the alveola(e) in the lungs,"" Richner said. The patients also suffered from encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, he said. ""We have now to see what really is causing the deadly pulmonary complication and see if a toxic factor is playing a role too,"" he said. Investigators probe mystery disease killing Cambodian children . The positive test for EV71 does not particularly help in the treatment of the illness, as there is no effective antiviral treatment for severe EV71 infections, and no vaccine is available. The way the syndrome is attacking the children is ""merciless,"" Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said from Cambodia. Gupta noted, though, that the disease did not appear to be ""clustering,"" or spreading rapidly in particular geographic areas, reducing fears of a possible epidemic. In milder cases, EV71 can cause coldlike symptoms, diarrhea and sores on the hands, feet and mouth, according to the journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy. But more severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain, resulting in polio-like paralysis and death. Adults' well-developed immune systems usually can fend off the virus, but children are vulnerable to it, according to the CDC. On Sunday, a World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Cambodia warned the new discovery ""does not mean we have solved the problem of the undiagnosed cases. A lot more analysis is needed, and further laboratory investigations need to be done."" The WHO said that other pathogens had been detected in the investigations, including dengue and Streptococcus suis. It added that samples tested negative for H5N1 and other influenza viruses. Tensions have arisen between the WHO and Kantha Bopha hospitals about the dissemination of information about the outbreak. The international organization has provided a lower death toll than the hospitals, saying Sunday that 52 out of a total number of 59 children affected by the mysterious syndrome had died between April and early July. In his statement Sunday, the hospital official Richner criticized the WHO for previously making statements to the news media ""without being clear on the facts."" ""WHO was telling whole the world: New mystery killer disease in Cambodia! This was causing unnecessary panic in Cambodia,"" Richter said. Richner has said the number of cases affected by the mysterious disease is relatively low -- 34 cases in June, compared with the 75,000 sick children at Kantha Bopha's outpatient clinics and 16,000 hospitalized kids. But Pieter van Maaren with the WHO in Cambodia rejected suggestions that his organization caused any kind of panic. He said Richner was the one who stated, in a letter to the government, that the situation in Cambodia was ""most severe."" ""WHO has not made any statement about the disease, other than what we issued in the joint press release with the Ministry of Health,"" van Maaren said. The ministry reported the outbreak to WHO through the International Health Regulations, which 194 nations are parties to, van Maaren said. ""Since this event fitted the criteria of being an event where the underlying agent, disease or mode of transmission is not identified at the time, WHO is obliged to communicate information to other member states,"" he said. EV71 was first isolated in California in 1969, according to the CDC. Mystery illnesses: A mother's painful quest for answers .

"(CNN) -- A proposed health curriculum in Helena, Montana, public schools has riled up some parents who say it starts teaching students about sex far too early. Several hundred parents in the mountain state's capital packed a school board meeting earlier this week to debate the 62-page proposal. It includes four pages of charts listing what elements of human sexuality should be introduced at which grades. ""Ninety-five percent, if not 99 percent, is really, really good stuff,"" Helena parent Brian Ackerman told HLN's ""Prime News."" But he added, ""It's not something we can attach 100 percent agreement with all of the committee members."" The proposed curriculum guide is part of a broad range of health courses that also teach nutriition, disease prevention, anatomy and environmental health. It would teach students as early as second grade that using anti-gay slurs is hurtful and teach children in older elementary grades about sexual harassment and abuse. Students would be told as early as kindergarten to properly name body parts. The concept that people ""can love people of the same gender and people of another gender"" would be introduced in first grade, though homosexual relationships aren't discussed until fifth grade. Fifth-graders also would learn that sexual intercourse ""includes but is not limited to vaginal, oral, or anal penetration."" Teachers would start discussing pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and drugs and alcohol with middle-schoolers, while high school students would learn about sexual orientation and the ""legal implications"" of some decisions. Ackeman, who has two elementary-age daughters and a third approaching kindergarten, said parents should be told ""who decided this, when did they decide it and how did they decide it?"" ""We really haven't seen where that age-appropriateness comes from,"" he said. In addition, he said the district has not figured out how to implement the program. ""There isn't any sort of implementation in place right now that says this is how we're going to teach this,"" Ackerman said. Bruce Messinger, Helena's school superintendent, said the guide was drawn up by a committee that included parents, teachers and administrators. That committee used local practices and examined national guidelines, including those put out by the American Academy of Pediatrics, he said. ""It establishes that between the ages of kindergarten through grade 4, vocabulary would be introduced so a student has an understanding,"" Messinger said. ""It doesn't specifically say what would happen."" Implementation plans will be developed later, he said -- and if parents object, he added, ""They have a right to opt out."" The last school board meeting drew not only critics but supporters. And Cathy Areu, publisher of the Latina women's magazine Catalina and a former high school teacher, told HLN the standards sound defensible and age-appropriate. ""It sounds like they are teaching body parts and things that are facts of life,"" Areu said. ""I feel more comfortable with my daughter learning about this in a classroom than from a boy in the hallway.""","Helena, Montana, schools are considering a health curriculum that includes sex education .

"(CNN) -- A 29-year-old Somali man was found guilty Thursday of attacking a Danish political cartoonist known for his drawing of the Muslim prophet Mohammed with a turban shaped as a bomb, authorities said. In a unanimous verdict, Mohamed Geele was found guilty of attempted terrorism, attempted manslaughter and attacking a police officer with a knife and an ax, said Danish Prosecutor Lene Lemt. Geele was accused of trying to break into the home of cartoonist Kurt Westergaard on January 1, 2010. He was shot in the right leg and left hand by an officer during the incident and hospitalized for his wounds. At the time, Danish intelligence officials had linked him to an East African Islamist militia allied with al Qaeda. Prosecutors are seeking 12 years in prison for Geele, who is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday. Al-Shabaab, the militant organization with alleged ties to Geele, is waging a bloody battle against Somalia's transitional government and is currently on a U.S. government list of terrorist organizations. At a January 2010 news conference in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said, ""We are very happy with the Somali national who attacked the house of the Danish cartoonist who previously insulted our prophet Mohammed. This is an honor for the Somali people. We are telling that we are glad that anyone who insults Islam should be attacked wherever they are."" Police had no indication that an attack was being planned on Westergaard, a police official said, though the intelligence service said the suspect had been under surveillance because of his alleged terrorist links. Police said the suspect managed to crack the glass front door of Westergaard's home. A home alarm alerted police to the scene, and they were attacked by the suspect, authorities said. Westergaard, who was home with his 5-year-old granddaughter at the time of the break-in, hid in a ""panic room"" when he realized what was happening, authorities said. Westergaard is ordinarily accompanied by bodyguards when he leaves his home, but nobody was on guard at the house that Friday, the Security and Intelligence Service told CNN. The cartoonist has said he wanted his controversial drawing to show that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terrorism. However, many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist. Over the years, Danish authorities have arrested other suspects who allegedly plotted against Westergaard's life.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A World Health Organization consultant who was conducting a polio vaccination campaign was attacked by unknown assailants in Karachi, Pakistan, on Tuesday, the group said. Dr. Constant Dedo, who was hired by the WHO's polio drive, was returning from a routine visit to Gadap, a town in northwestern Karachi, WHO spokeswoman Maryam Yunus said. His vehicle was intercepted by gunmen on a motorbike and shot at; the first bullets struck the tires, rendering the vehicle immobile, Yunus said. The assailants then fired at the driver, who was struck in the neck and shoulders, and Dedo, who was shot in the abdomen, Yunus said. ""Both were given first aid and shifted to Agha Khan Hospital,"" Yunus said. ""Their condition is stable, and they are out of danger."" The motive for the attack was unclear. However, Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program last year to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011. Last month, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. ""Polio drops will be banned in North Waziristan"" until the strikes cease, according to a Taliban statement. North Waziristan is a tribal region of Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. The WHO said the ban could affect about 280,000 children living in tribal areas. A three-day nationwide effort to administer polio vaccines began this week, but health workers and volunteers were not able to immunize children in North and South Waziristan, the organization said. Read more about WHO's estimates about the ban's effect . Dedo, who is from Ghana, has been living in Karachi for some time while working on the anti-polio campaign. The driver was a WHO staffer, Yunus said. Police were investigating and would interview the driver, she said. It was unclear whether Dedo's vehicle had a security convoy with it, a routine practice, she said. WHO officials had informed leaders in Gadap of Dedo's visit before his arrival, Yunus said. It was the first time WHO staff has been attacked in Pakistan, she said, but the organization will not suspend operations.

"(CNN) -- Tokyo was known as Edo until 1868, but it's hard to imagine that this high-rise, high-tech metropolis could possibly have existed in a time before electricity and concrete. Tokyo isn't just a futuristic city; it's the place that has shaped our vision of what the future will look like. In Tokyo, the future is a long-standing tradition. There's a sci-fi familiarity to areas like Shibuya, Shinjuku and Akihabara; the skyscrapers glowing with illuminated signs, subway stops inside shopping malls and taxis with automated doors could be straight out of ""Blade Runner"" or ""The Fifth Element."" But the space-age topography of Tokyo has been shaped by a history of catastrophe. In the 20th century alone Tokyo suffered earthquakes, fires and devastating bombing. The result is a city that has repeatedly been forced to rebuild, shedding its past with each successive redevelopment. In Tokyo, the future is a long-standing tradition. After centuries of expansion, Tokyo has grown vertically to accommodate its 12 million residents. Perhaps the inevitability of another catastrophic earthquake accounts for the lack of emotional attachment to the city's architecture; buildings are continuously being pulled down and replaced, creating the sensation that Tokyo's skyline is a permanent work in progress. While it can seem that the city is intent on stream rolling over its past, you can still see traces of old Edo. The Meiji Jingu Shrine tells of the city's Shinto heritage and there's something timeless about the charming chaos of Tsukiji Fish Market. Even the enduring formalities of Tokyo's social etiquette and the joy with which Tokyoites greet the coming of the cherry blossom are signs that the city maintains a lingering affection for its traditions. At first glance, Tokyoites may seem sober and industrious, efficiently going about the business of making their city a world capital of techno commerce, but shops filled with manga comics and anime DVDs hint at a desire to escape the obligations of real life. That appetite for escapism is most colorfully expressed in the phenomenon of ""cosplay"", which sees teenagers dress as characters from cartoons and comic strips, or in the outlandish uniforms of various distinctive subcultures. In the 80s, Japan's bubble economy created unsustainable growth in Tokyo and property prices in the capital went through the roof. When the bubble burst in the early 90s, Tokyo was hit particularly hard but, after years of recession, Tokyo has the buzz of a city regaining its confidence. For this endlessly fascinating city, it's back to business -- and back to the future.","Known as Edo until 1868, Tokyo has been shaped by a history of disasters .

When Nicole Kidman set up house outside of Nashville with country music megastar Keith Urban, the farm's distance from Los Angeles and New York was a big part of the draw. Nashville's warm, casual, down-home feel is easy to love. Even if you're not a country music fan, visit the Country Music Hall of Fame for the rich Americana and the impressive curation. In addition to the diverse collection of costumes, memorabilia, instruments and photographs, the museum cleverly ""displays"" the music itself using snail-shell spiral pods that allow you to sample recordings spanning decades in the genre's evolution. Once you're ready for a little irreverence about country music, catch a Doyle and Debbie Show, a parody act ""simultaneously lampooning and idolizing"" the iconic duo tradition, which the Nashville Scene called a ""hilarious piece of low-brow inspiration turned into high entertainment."" For some serious soul food that diners call a ""damn fine meat and three,"" head to At the Table in South Nashville. They close early so make yours a lunch visit.

Paul Helmke, the former mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, is a Republican and president of the Brady Campaign. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend says the bloody Mexican drug war is being fueled by American guns. (CNN) -- America's neighbor to the south is engaged in a bloody war with ruthless drug cartels. It is a war that is threatening to bring down the government of Mexico, is spilling over into neighborhoods in the United States and is fast becoming a serious national security concern. American gun sellers supply the cartels with 95 to 100 percent of their guns, according to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. While the Mexican drug war has the media and Washington abuzz, there has been little mention of our role in supplying the terrorists: We need to realize that the Mexican drug cartels are arming themselves here because our gun laws have loopholes so large that criminals and gun traffickers can easily drive gun-laden trucks through them. Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora correctly called American gun laws ""absurd."" This crisis is not happening because our border is loose. It is happening because our gun laws allow guns to be sold by unlicensed sellers without background checks required by the Brady Bill, military-style assault weapons to be freely sold and corrupt gun dealers to thrive. We need to prevent Mexican criminals and the traffickers who supply them from buying guns by changing our gun laws and strengthening U.S. law enforcement's ability to crack down on corrupt gun dealers. Although it is urgent that we help stem the violence in Mexico, we must realize that the same legal loopholes and corrupt gun sellers that help arm Mexican criminals also arm American criminals. We should heed the call of Mexican officials to help stop the violence there, but we also should heed the call of the vast majority of Americans to stop the violence in their communities. Proposals from Washington have ignored these central points, instead focusing on border issues, enforcement of current laws and a possible federal ban on assault weapons. Though helpful, those proposals do not address some other fundamental weaknesses of our gun laws. If we want to help the Mexican people and our own, we must eliminate the loopholes and gaps in federal law that allow guns to be sold without Brady background checks by unlicensed sellers. The ATF has found that gun sales without background checks are a major source for supplying dangerous people with guns. Under current federal law, only gun sales by a federally licensed gun dealer are subject to Brady background checks. ""Private sales"" by unlicensed sellers don't require a background check. At gun shows -- sort of like flea markets for firearms -- so-called private sellers sell guns to anyone, no questions asked, except in states that have closed this loophole under state law. Texas and Arizona continue to allow private sellers to sell without background checks, and gun shows in those states are one of the sources of guns recovered in Mexico. Mexican drug cartels are exploiting this loophole. We all agree that criminals should not be allowed to buy guns. We should also agree that all gun sellers should check to make sure they are not arming criminals. There is more we should do. We must get rid of the riders, known collectively as the Tiahrt Amendment, attached annually to Justice Department appropriations legislation since 2004. These riders weaken enforcement of our laws by prohibiting the ATF from releasing gun crime gun data to law enforcement and others, prohibiting the ATF from requiring gun dealer inventory audits and requiring the destruction of critical Brady background check records within only 24 hours. We also should further strengthen the ATF by making it easier to revoke the licenses of reckless dealers, give it the power to suspend licenses and levy civil penalties, and eliminate the bizarre restriction that limits the ATF to only one spot inspection of a gun dealer per year. In addition to strengthening the ATF's enforcement power, we need to attack gun trafficking at its source by limiting the high-volume gun sales that fuel trafficking from licensed dealers. Under federal law, there is no limit to how many handguns or assault weapons a purchaser can buy at a time, allowing gun traffickers to quickly amass guns suitable for an army. Every year, 30,000 Americans are killed with guns, but all too often, Washington has ignored the pleas of the vast majority of Americans calling for sanity in our gun laws. Politicians frequently echo the gun lobby refrain to only ""enforce the laws on the books,"" refusing to admit that there are very few laws on the books. But the Mexican drug war has upped the ante. Now that our weak gun laws threaten the stability of an important ally, fueling one of our nation's most ominous global security threats, the question is whether we will strengthen our gun laws to protect Mexicans, and Americans, or whether we will cater to the extremist gun lobby. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Paul Helmke.","Townsend, Helmke: U.S. guns are helping fuel the Mexican drug war .

"(CNN) -- An outbreak of a virulent strain of E. coli has killed 19 people in Europe and infected more than 2,000 in at least 12 countries, the World Health Organization said on Saturday. All but one of the fatalities were reported in Germany, where officials say it's still too early to determine whether the peak of the outbreak has passed. One person in Sweden also died. In Germany, there have been 573 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) -- a form of kidney failure -- in the current European outbreak, according to WHO. That's more cases of HUS than in any other recorded outbreak, worldwide. Twelve patients in Germany have died of HUS, according to WHO, while six died of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, EHEC, a strain that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines and can result in abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea. Reports indicate that an estimated 1,428 people have that E. coli strain so far but do not have HUS, according to the World Health Organization. Infections have also been identified in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, according to the organization. The European Food Safety Alert Network initially said enterohemorrhagic E. coli was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to various countries. But authorities have said that the source of the contamination has not been pinpointed. The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention, has advised German consumers not to eat raw tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. Cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce imported from Germany and Spain will be tested and cleared before they are sold in the United States, according to David Elder of the Food and Drug Administration, and those test results will be shared with the European Union. Germany and Spain account for a small fraction of produce that is sold in the United States in a given year. Two women and a man who traveled last month to northern Germany remain hospitalized in the United States with HUS, Chris Braden of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. A fourth person developed bloody diarrhea, but was not hospitalized, he added. Two U.S. service members in Germany also developed diarrhea, Braden said. ""We have no expectation that this will spread in our country,"" he added.","At least 19 people have died in Europe after an outbreak of a virulent E. coli strain .

"(CNN) -- Michigan's attorney general has requested a criminal investigation into the conduct of an embattled Massachusetts company linked to a recent deadly fungal meningitis outbreak. Michigan had at least 259 infections and 14 deaths, leading the nation in people affected by the outbreak last year, said Bill Schuette, the state's attorney general. The outbreak, linked to tainted steroid injections from New England Compounding Center, killed 51 people and infected 730 people in 20 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Massachusetts drug compounder recalls some of its injectables . ""Hundreds of Michigan citizens and their families have endured terrible pain and deaths of loved ones suffering from illnesses caused by these tainted steroid injections,"" said Schuette. ""This investigation is necessary to uncover the truth as to how this unspeakable tragedy happened and to restore public faith in our healthcare system."" Schuette said he filed a petition to the Michigan Court of Appeals to have a grand jury determine if the company broke any state laws ""when it distributed tainted steroid injections to patients at clinics in four Michigan counties."" What is a compounding pharmacy? A representative of the New England Compounding Center could not immediately be reached for comment.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pan American Health Organization announced Tuesday it is increasing its planning to treat 400,000 cholera cases within the next year, up from a previous estimate of 270,000 over several years, as a result of the outbreak in Haiti. ""We need to plan for up to half of those cases occurring in the next three months because of the explosive nature of this epidemic,"" the organization's deputy director, Dr. Jon Kim Andrus, told reporters in Washington. ""We need more of everything,"" he said. ""More training for staff in Haiti, more doctors, more nurses, more treatment centers, more medications, more toilets, more clean water."" Since last month, when the outbreak began, the organization known by its acronym of PAHO -- the regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO) -- has distributed enough supplies to treat about 80,000 cases, he said. As of Tuesday, the Haitian government was reporting 60,240 people had been sickened by cholera and 1,415 had died. Short-term efforts are focusing on the distribution of chlorine tablets and oral rehydration salts, which are key to preventing and treating the disease. ""In the long term, we must create the systems and infrastructure to ensure equitable access to these basic services,"" Andrus said. So far, cholera cases have been confirmed in eight of the nation's 10 departments and clusters of cases are being investigated in the other two departments, he said. ""We have not yet reached a peak and we don't know when that peak will occur,"" he said. PAHO has urged health ministries throughout the Americas to beef up their planning in the event the disease takes hold outside Haiti, he said. That was the case with Peru, where an outbreak in 1991 spread to more than16 countries from Argentina to Canada within two years. But the job of stemming the outbreak has been hampered by non-medical considerations. In Haiti's North Department, some PAHO staff members and other international staff and medical workers remain confined to their living quarters after civil unrest there this week, Andrus said. Staffing for governmental and non-governmental organizations battling the outbreak remains a major challenge. ""We are encouraging partners to do everything possible to hire and train the Haitian people using cash-for-work programs,"" he said. Haiti's public health infrastructure was weak before the outbreak, with 58 percent of the population lacking access to potable water, Andrus said. More than three in four Haitians earn less than $2 a day. Some 1.6 million Haitians are living in ""precarious conditions, particularly those in the 1,300 displacement camps,"" he said. Only about 10 percent of the $164 million sought by a coalition of about 48 humanitarian organizations working in Haiti, including NGOs, has been received, according to WHO.","Health officials are planning for half of the cases to occur within three months .

"(CNN) -- ""Barney Oldfield's Race for a Life"" (1913) is a 13-minute silent movie. In it, Oldfield, the most famous auto racer of his day, races to rescue a damsel in distress whom a mustache-twirling villain has chained to a railroad track. (You can watch the whole thing on YouTube if you like. Spoiler alert: A few of the characters get killed.) A hundred years later, Danica Patrick, the most famous auto racer of HER day, will be on a track Sunday in the race of HER life. Very vulnerable, very motivated, she will be a hero to many in the audience and a villain to some. Go, Danni. Daytona 500s have been running since 1959. They have been won by Richard Petty and his dad, by Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and his dad, by Davey Allison and his dad, by the brothers Waltrip, by a 50-year-old, by a 20-year-old and by a whole lot of fine gents down South. Just ain't never been won by no woman. I will be pulling for Patrick, now that she holds the pole position for Sunday's race, for this reason and for no other -- just because it would be something unique. A surge forward. A giant checkered flag for womankind. Bleacher Report: Danica Patrick Still Has Much to Prove Amidst NASCAR's Best Drivers . You often see women IN auto races. You just seldom see women WIN auto races. I haven't personally seen one cross a finish line first since Lindsay Lohan drove a VW Beetle to victory in that movie ""Herbie: Fully Loaded."" Excuse me, then, for being of the opinion that Danica Patrick winning the Daytona 500 would be a pretty cool thing. It would be up there with other unlikely things I never expected to see in my lifetime, like Ben Affleck maybe beating Steven Spielberg for an Oscar. Now, note that I didn't call this person the most distinguished driver of her day. Or the best in any way. (Except at posing in a bikini.) I have a high regard for the men of this profession, many of whom might find Patrick's famous face in their rear-view mirrors Sunday on their cannonball run toward Victory Lane. It wouldn't shock me a bit if her green No. 10 Chevrolet SS ended up in the back of the pack. Or racked or wrecked. Or up on some tow truck's hook. Or overheating under the hood like a '57 Bel Air. Pits happen. If things do go wrong, that's OK. They do to everybody, male or female. Cars break down. Drivers make mistakes. Jerks come out of nowhere and cut you off. Hey, consider yourself lucky these days if you go for a drive and don't end up waiting for deep-voiced Dennis Haysbert and his insurance folks from Allstate. Bleacher Report: Daytona 500: Danica Patrick Can Break Ground for Women's Sports with Victory . Patrick's life will be totally fine even if she doesn't win. She makes a ton of money. She has a mean, green publicity machine. She even has a new boyfriend. (A fellow driver, Ricky Stenhouse Jr.) She still has her Go Daddy! ads, although, to be perfectly frank with you, I still have no clue to this day what it is Go Daddy! is supposed to do for you. She is resented by some for her fame. ""What has she ever won?"" is a common refrain. Hey, this woman placed third in the 2009 Indianapolis 500. That is not nothing. Do you know what the great Barney Oldfield's best finish was in an Indy 500? Fifth. He still ended up in movies and doing endorsements and becoming the most famous car racer of his time. That's show biz. Patrick has come a long way since being a high school cheerleader in Rockton, Illinois, during her Fast Times at Hononegah High teens. She drove go-karts. She had a need for speed. She liked to get behind the wheel of anything with wheels. What else would you expect of someone born in Beloit, Wisconsin, where a man (Arthur P. Warner) supposedly invented the first automobile speedometer? Or from a woman who was brought up in an Illinois county called Winnebago. I mean, some girls are born to be debutantes or doctors. Danica Patrick was born to be first in line at the DMV. She is not a true pioneer. I mean, we are not talking Amelia Earhart here. Odette Siko and Marguerite Mareuse, a couple of Frenchwomen, drove a Bugatti in the 24 Hours of LeMans endurance race of 1932. They took seventh place. (I can confirm neither did a sexy ad for a ""Go Pere!"" website.) Sarah Fisher has driven in the Indy 500 nine times, Lyn St. James seven times. I once covered a Riverside, California, race where a Ford Mustang driven by St. James was going 160 mph when it swerved into a wall and burst into flames, while a rival car went airborne. St. James was bruised and battered, but limped away to race another day. Female drivers are tough, man. Shirley Muldowney's nitro-fuel dragster once had a front tire blow in Montreal and she broke both legs when it crashed. If you go to Shirley's website, the autographed items you can purchase include her fire suits. It isn't as if Daytona hasn't seen any estrogen along with all that testosterone. (No, these are not new products from Pennzoil.) As far back as 1977, a true trailblazer, Janet Guthrie, drove in the 500. She finished ahead of Bobby Allison, David Pearson, Ricky Rudd, Salt Walther, Richard Petty -- not bad. So she never won it. Big flamin' deal. You think it's easy to race WITH the best, much less beat them, hey, let's see you try it. Bleacher Report: Danica Patrick: Why a Win at Daytona 500 Would Ruffle Feathers of Fellow Drivers . Daytona 500s attract the best drivers in the business. It is the Super Bowl of its sport. It has given its fans countless thrills, ever since Lee Petty (daddy of Richard) sped to the checkered flag in his Olds simultaneously with Johnny Beauchamp's T-Bird in a photo finish that required three days to sort out. (Petty won and was handed a nice $19,000, if you'll pardon the expression, purse.) Oh, the great competitors we have seen, from ""Fireball"" Roberts to ""Tiny"" Lund, from the coincidental Yarborough (Cale) vs. Yarbrough (LeeRoy) clash of 1968, from the climactic spinout of '76 when Pearson was able to get his Mercury to crawl and sputter across the finish line. What a blast it was in 1989 to see Darrell Waltrip finally win at Daytona on his 17th try -- and on fumes, with a fuel tank that was very definitely on E. What a pleasure to see the superpopular, bizarrely doomed Dale Earnhardt take the checkered flag there in '98 after two decades of being a Daytona also-ran. To win on the same track where in 2001 he would die. On the same track where in 2004 the same race would be won by his son. Legends and lore are what it's all about at the Daytona 500.

"(CNN) -- The Philippine Supreme Court postponed the introduction of a controversial law that aims to provide government-funded contraception and sex education classes in the mainly Catholic country. The Southeast Asian nation's top court issued an order on Tuesday delaying the implementation of the law for 120 days while it waits to hear arguments from several petitions against the new measures, the official Philippines News Agency (PNA) reported. Lawmakers approved the legislation, named the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act, in December after years of campaigning by public health and women's rights activists. President Benigno Aquino III signed it into law the same month, with his office saying it had closed a divisive chapter in the nation's history. But the Supreme Court decision has reopened the contentious topic, raising the hopes of leaders of the Catholic Church in the Philippines who oppose the measures. ""For me it's a good sign, a victory"" for those who are against the law, said Bishop Arturo Bastes of Sorsogon, according to PNA. He said he believed that Pope Francis, who was officially inaugurated on Tuesday, would be happy to hear of the delay. Despite widespread support for the new measures in the Philippines, the Catholic Church lobbied against the legislation, saying it would undermine marriage and morality. More than 80% of the Philippines' 96 million citizens are Catholic. One of the petitions submitted to the court against the law argues that ""the State cannot, as a general principle, routinely invade the privacy of married couples in the exercise of their most intimate rights and duties to their respective spouses,"" according to PNA. But supporters of the legislation, like Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago, say it is necessary to help people in the Philippines ""escape the vicious cycle of poverty by giving them options on how to manage their sexual lives, plan their families and control their procreative activities.""","Philippine lawmakers approved the reproductive health bill late last year .

"(CNN) -- Double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius will compete at the Olympic Games after he was named in both the individual 400m and the South Africa 4x400m relay squad for London 2012. The four-time Paralympic Games gold medalist won a silver medal as part of South Africa's 4x400m relay at the World Championships in Daegu last year, although he was left out of the line-up for the final.

"(CNN) -- Twelve people walked into a Colorado movie theater late one July night, expecting to enjoy a special midnight screening of the Batman film, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" They didn't walk out. Their deaths -- and injuries to dozens of others -- came after a man dressed head to toe in protective tactical gear sprayed the Century 16 theater in Aurora with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and a .40-caliber pistol, weapons police discovered at the scene. On Monday, many grisly details of what happened could be presented in a Colorado court at a preliminary hearing for the shooting suspect, James Holmes. Now 25, Holmes faces 166 charges, including murder, attempted murder and weapons offenses, tied to the July 20 rampage. Bits and pieces emerged from police and witnesses shortly after the massacre. One was that Holmes had colored his hair red and told police he was ""the Joker,"" one of Batman's archenemies, according to a federal law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation. But much information has been kept under wraps, especially after Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester issued a gag order to prevent defense lawyers, prosecutors and law enforcement agencies from disclosing certain information to the media. That could change after this week's hearing, which is expected to last several days. Prosecutors are expected to call scores of witnesses and outline their evidence in the case. Holmes's attorneys, meanwhile, are expected to argue he has ""diminished capacity,"" a term that, according to the Colorado Bar Association, relates to a person's ability or inability ""to make adequately considered decisions"" regarding his or her legal representation because of ""mental impairment or for some other reason."" After the hearing concludes, Sylvester will determine whether there is enough evidence for Holmes to stand trial. University releases e-mails related to Holmes . While officials and news reports have shed light on Holmes, his motive hasn't been spelled out. He was a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the Anschutz Medical Campus of the University of Colorado, Denver, in Aurora, until he withdrew a month before being arrested outside the bullet-riddled movie theater. Holmes had been a patient of a University of Colorado psychiatrist, according to a court document filed by his lawyers. Authorities later discovered that his sparsely decorated Aurora apartment was booby-trapped with more than 30 homemade grenades and 10 gallons of gasoline, a law enforcement official who saw video showing its interior told CNN. Authorities intentionally detonated two rigged explosives in order to access the third-floor, one-bedroom apartment. What spurred him to rig his apartment in such a way and to later fatally shoot strangers is not clear. Academically, Holmes excelled at the University of California, Riverside, according to Chancellor Timothy P. White. His only brush with the law in Colorado appears to have been a 2011 summons for speeding from Aurora police. The horror Holmes allegedly unleashed inside the movie theater has been better documented, thanks to accounts from survivors and law enforcement sources. After the movie started, the suspect went out a rear exit door, propped it open, gathered weapons, then re-entered through the same door, according to a source. He then tossed in a canister before starting to shoot. Screaming moviegoers scrambled to escape from the gunman, who shot at random as he walked up the theater's steps, witnesses said. It was a scene ""straight out of a horror film,"" said Chris Ramos, who was inside the theater. ""He was just literally shooting everyone, like hunting season,"" Ramos said. Holmes surrendered without resistance within seven minutes of the first calls from panicked moviegoers reporting the shooting, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said. Meanwhile, local hospitals found themselves overwhelmed with victims, including one who was just 4 months old. Soon thereafter, 12 families heard the horrifying news that their loved ones were dead. ""This is an act of evil,"" Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper told CNN.","The preliminary hearing tied to the July 20 shooting is expected to last several days .

"(CNN) -- Members of a fringe Christian group in China have been rounded up for spreading rumors of an impending apocalypse, pegged to the Mayan calendar. Known as the ""Almighty God"" cult, the group latched on to the Mayan doomsday scenario to predict the sun will not shine and electricity will not work for three days beginning on December 21, an official with the Department of Public Security in the northwest province of Qinghai told CNN. Group members would spread doomsday rumors door-to-door or at public venues and claimed only they could save people's lives, according to authorities. What a year for China in 2012 -- what about next year? The state-run Xinhua news agency reported that almost 100 people have been arrested so far, including 37 in Qinghai and 34 in Fujian province in the east of the country. A large number of banners, discs, slogans, books and printing machines were seized by police, Xinhua said. According to Xinhua, the cult was established in 1990 in central China and requires its members to surrender their property to the group. December 21, 2012, is the endpoint of a more than 5,000-year Great Cycle marked on the ""Long Count"" calendar of the Mayans -- an ancient native American civilization.

"(CNN) -- The first time I saw Oscar Pistorius run, I was captivated. Witnessing him caused me to jump up and down. My 10-year-old son, an amputee since the first week of his life, calmly commented, ""Mom, he's just a man!"" I suppose that should have curbed my enthusiasm. But to see a man in motion without the use of feet was simply magical. I saw him as a future superhero for my son, who is missing part of his right forearm and hand. Completely inspired, I felt as though I had witnessed the Messiah. I was so captivated that I started posting his likeness all over my Facebook page. In short, I was caught up in ""Oscar-mania."" Even my church pastor had preached about Pistorius. The ""Blade Runner,"" he said, represented Christian values. He embodied things that I wish for my son's life. Seeing Pistorius at the Olympic and Paralympic Games was amazing and did something very special to raise awareness of athletes with physical differences. However, in the hysteria, I lost sight of one simple thing that my son had been able to see: Pistorius is just a man. He has the ability to make the mistakes of mortals. He is not a god; he is a person, and I got caught up in the passion. In full: Pistorius' affidavit to court . We don't know what really happened. I would like to believe that Reeva Steenkamp's death was a horrible accident. Oscar Pistorius may or may not be guilty. But, whatever happened, there is a lesson: Too often in life, we put people on pedestals. We set them up to fail. The reality is that, despite their seemingly superhuman performances, they are just people with their own sets of challenges. The truth is, I wanted my son to have a role model. The first part of his life was filled with questions for me. I wanted someone to tell me that he would be OK. After he was born, the first couple of times that I saw someone with a limb difference, I would race up to them and start a conversation. In the beginning, this approach brought me comfort. One morning at the gym, I spotted a man with a limb difference like my son's. At the time, my baby was only 6 months old. I ran up to him and said hello. The guy turned and looked at me. In a thick French-Canadian accent, he responded, ""Hello, my dear!"" Completely embarrassed, I thrust my baby into his range of vision and stumbled to say, ""He, he, he is like you!"" Suddenly, his seductive voice changed to a matter-of-fact tone. In an instant, he said the words I have never forgotten: ""This is your issue.

"(CNN) -- The number of women dying in pregnancy and childbirth has dropped by a third in the past two decades, according to a report out Wednesday from four world bodies including Unicef and the World Health Organization. The report says the number has decreased by 34 percent, from an estimated 546,000 in 1990 to 358,000 in 2008. ""The global reduction in maternal death rates is encouraging news,"" said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan. While the progress is notable, the rate of decline is still less than half of what is needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of a 75-percent reduction by 2015, the report said. That would require an annual decline of 5.5 percent, whereas the 34-percent drop represents an annual decline of 2.3 percent. The reason for the decline in deaths is that countries with greater risks during pregnancy and childbirth are taking more effective measures, such as training more midwives and strengthening hospitals and health centers to assist pregnant women, Chan said. ""No woman should die due to inadequate access to family planning and to pregnancy and delivery care,"" she said. There are four major causes of death for pregnant women, according to the report: severe bleeding after childbirth, infections, hypertensive disorders, and unsafe abortion. Those four reasons caused 1,000 women to die in 2008. More than half of those deaths happened in sub-Saharan Africa, and a third happened in South Asia. Women in developing countries are 36 times more at risk of dying from a pregnancy-related complication than a woman in a developed country, the report said. ""To achieve our global goal of improving maternal health and to save women's lives, we need to do more to reach those who are most at risk,"" said Unicef Executive Director Anthony Lake. ""That means reaching women in rural areas and poorer households, women from ethnic minorities and indigenous groups, and women living with HIV and in conflict zones."" Unicef and the World Health Organization issued the report together with the World Bank and the United Nations Population Fund.","Deaths have gone from 546,000 in 1990 to 358,000 in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Ernesto churned across the Caribbean Sea on Saturday, regaining some strength even as forecasters expect it to grow more powerful and emerge as a Category 1 hurricane in the next few days, the National Hurricane Center said. That means that by the time it likely passes south of Jamaica on Sunday evening, Ernesto could pack sustained winds in excess of 74 mph. As is, the Miami-based weather center reported in its 8 p.m. advisory that the storm had regular winds of 60 mph and even more potent gusts. Ernesto had weakened somewhat earlier Saturday, but leveled off through the middle of the day and then got even stronger. By Saturday night, tropical-storm-force winds, at 39 mph or stronger, could be felt up to 140 miles for the storm's center about 260 miles south-southwest of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and 435 miles east-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica. The Jamaican government has issued a tropical storm warning for the Caribbean island, meaning such conditions are expected there some time over the next 36 hours. The storm could bring three to six inches of rain, if not more, to Jamaica by the time it's gone, the hurricane center said. Residents and visitors on other Caribbean islands such as Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire could also find themselves getting drenched. ""Some strengthening is possible during the next 48 hours and Ernesto could become a hurricane during the next day or so,"" the hurricane center said of Ernesto at 8 p.m., when it was spinning west at an 18 mph clip. The storm is forecast to enter the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday morning, by which time it is expected to be back to tropical storm status, according to forecasters. ""Past Thursday, we will be monitoring this storm very closely for further development in the Gulf,"" CNN meteorologist Sarah Dillingham said. Ernesto is not the only tropical threat forecasters are monitoring. Tropical Storm Florence strengthened a bit Saturday over the open Atlantic Ocean, its center about 515 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands as it headed toward the Leeward Islands. At 5 p.m. Saturday, the storm was heading west-northwest at a 15 mph rate and had sustained winds of 50 mph, a shade weaker than Ernesto. It could gain more strength over the next few days, the hurricane center said. Complete coverage of weather .","NEW: Even with Ernesto 435 miles away, Jamaica may see rains and winds Sunday .

"(CNN) -- David Bill isn't annoyed when Twitter gets so bogged down with traffic that he can't post a message. Twitter's ""fail whale,"" which appears when the site is overrun, is so popular it's on T-shirts and even tattoos. That's because in the moment when frustration would hit, he's greeted on the popular Web site by a cartoonish image he loves: a giant whale being lifted out of an ocean by a small flock of tweeting birds. The icon -- which Twitter users call it the ""fail whale"" because the creature appears only when the site has failed to load -- has gained a cult following as the social media site grows at breakneck pace. The conversational Web site, which lets users post 140-character microblogs, saw a 1,374 percent jump in unique visitors between February 2008 and February this year, up to 7 million from only 475,000, according to Nielsen NetView. By comparison, Facebook grew 228 percent, to 65.7 million users, during the same period. With all of those new Twitterers, fail whale sightings and site crashes seem more frequent. Bill (mr_bill on Twitter) and other fail-whale followers aren't bothered, though. The 36-year-old San Franciscan has organized parties in honor of the whale. The most recent, held in California in February, was attended by more than 300 people, including Yiying Lu, the artist in Australia who created the image. Bill says the whale represents a contrarian philosophy. ""It's sort of an adorable whale but also this thing that represents the Herculean tasks that we sometimes go about from day to day,"" he said. ""We're all trying to do a lot of things that seem pretty impossible,"" Bill said. ""It's nice to identify something positive with those failures."" Not every Twitterer is sympathetic to the site's troubles, though. Some users say Twitter has outgrown its core audience and is irrelevant to the technophiles who made it popular in the first place. Others are annoyed by the flood of spammers and profiteers who now use the site's popularity to make a buck. Celebrities and members of Congress have been jumping onto the site in recent months, adding to the site's mainstream popularity and, some users say, causing glitches in the system. ""I keep getting the fail whale. Twitter got too popular too quickly. I blame Shaq,"" wrote Jessica Roy, a 21-year-old New York University student who goes by suchamessica on Twitter. Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal, or THE_REAL_SHAQ, has more than 470,000 followers on the site. Nova Spivack, a blogger whose article ""Can Twitter Survive What is About to Happen to It?"" has been passed around the site, said a rift is developing between Twitter's original ""in crowd"" and its newer, more mainstream users. Early adopters find many of the new users annoying, he said. ""A lot of people come in, and they take that 'What are you doing?' question literally, and so they put very inane things on Twitter,"" he said. iReport.com: How do you feel about tweets and status updates? The site used to feel ""insulated"" from the mainstream, and now it doesn't, he said. But for all the complaints, there seem to be just as many people who are almost excited about Twitter's growing pains. It is inevitable that a Web site seeing Twitter-style growth would face some glitches and a backlash from early adopters, said Laura Fitton, a consultant and co-author of the book ""Twitter for Dummies."" ""There's going to be all kinds of people using it all kinds of different ways,"" she said. ""The purists can go pound rocks."" Major news such as the Mumbai terrorist attacks and the Hudson River plane landing has broken over Twitter, and that's added to the site's popularity, she said. Amy Gahran, who writes on social media at contentious.com, said the backlash against Twitter stems from the fact that people are uncomfortable with change. Early users see new people coming to the site, and that creeps them out, but it shouldn't, she said. ""Change is freaking good,"" she said. ""Roll with it."" As the site gets filled with fresh users, people are creating pieces of software to help Twitterers sort through the noise, Gahran said. She said Twitter is popular because it mimics real-life conversation and because it's easy to use. She also expects Twitter to expand, especially as people in developing countries use cell-phone text messages to communicate through the site. ""People talk. That's what we do,"" she said. ""We're social creatures. We're kind of wired for this."" Twitter says it is addressing breakdowns in that wired communication. ""We have made amazing progress from a technical perspective as far as accommodating this rapid growth goes and will continue to improve system and subsystem performance moving forward,"" Twitter co-founder Biz Stone wrote in a statement to CNN. Critter Gewlas of Cary, North Carolina, believes so much in the site's ability to overcome adversity that he recently got a tattoo of the fail whale on his leg. ""The site itself has suffered a few scrapes and bumps along the way, but for the most part, I definitely think it's a good thing,"" said the 36-year-old. The fail whale's account on Twitter has more than 2,265 followers. A Facebook group dedicated to the whale has more than 4,400 members. The whale has spawned art and merchandise, from coffee mugs to baby clothes. A Current.com parody of the whale has spun around the Internet, too. Bill, whose fail whale parties have featured an aquamarine martini in honor of the icon's color, said the whale's popularity comes from the idea that failures are worth celebrating and learning from. Twitter will use that philosophy to continue to grow, he said. ""Twitter is a powerful enough thing that it should succeed in a broad way, and I would like it to succeed in a broad way,"" he said.","Twitter saw growth of more than 1,300 percent in the year up to February .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The first woman mayor of San Diego has acknowledged in court she misappropriated more than $2 million from her late husband's foundation to fund a casino gambling habit with which she allegedly won and lost $1 billion over nine years. Her attorney said a brain tumor affected Maureen O'Connor's judgment in playing video poker. She's now broke and suffering cognitive impairment following brain surgery and a stroke in 2011, prosecutors said. O'Connor, mayor of San Diego from 1986 to 1992, reported to the IRS more than $1 billion in casino winnings but also reported losses bigger than those winnings, resulting in a net loss from 2000 to 2009, prosecutors said in court papers. Those net losses amounted to $13 million, her attorney said. O'Connor was married to Robert O. Peterson, founder of the Jack in the Box restaurant chain, from 1977 until his death in 1994, but court documents don't disclose the size of the couple's fortune that apparently funded O'Connor's gambling habit. O'Connor, 66, entered a deferred prosecution agreement Thursday in federal court in San Diego in which she admitted misappropriating money from the R.P. Foundation, on which she served as a trustee. Under the agreement, she will repay the foundation $2,088,000, pay owed taxes, and be treated for her gambling addiction, prosecutors said. O'Connor, however, is bankrupt and unable to work, court papers say. Her ability to repay the foundation is ""limited,"" they say. In 2011, surgeons removed a large tumor from O'Connor's brain, and she suffered complications that included cognitive impairment and a pulmonary embolism, prosecutors said. Magistrate Judge David Bartick found that her continuing health problems made it highly improbable she could be brought to trial, prosecutors said. If O'Connor repays the foundation and satisfies the conditions of her deferred prosecution, the government will dismiss its prosecution in two years, prosecutors said. She faces an unlawful monetary transaction charge carrying a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, documents say. ""Maureen O'Connor was a selfless public official who contributed much to the well-being of San Diego,"" U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy of San Diego said in a prepared statement. ""However, no figure, regardless of how much good they've done or how much they've given to charity, can escape criminal liability with impunity."" O'Connor told reporters Thursday that for a while, she didn't know she had a brain tumor. ""There were two Maureens -- Maureen No. 1 and Maureen No. 2,"" she said. ""Maureen No. 2 is the woman that did not know she had a tumor growing in her head."" She described that era as ""the last chapter of my life where I lost my husband, I lost three of my siblings, I lost my two best friends and I had a difficult time. ""I think most of you who know me here would know that I never meant to hurt the city,"" she told reporters. She began to choke up and cry. O'Connor was described as ""a public figure and a civic treasure to the San Diego community"" for 30 years, according to court papers filed by her attorney. She is the eighth of 13 children of a mother who was a registered nurse and a father, Jerome, who was a boxer known as ""Kid Jerome"" and later became a prominent businessman, defense documents said. She was elected to city council at age 25 in 1971 and, later as mayor, ""put our city on the map as a destination for international tourism,"" partly by presiding over the completion of the city's Convention Center, defense documents said. O'Connor's attorney attributed her gambling addiction to her medical condition. ""This was not, we think, a psychiatric problem or a characterological defect because there is substantial evidence that during this same time, there was a tumor growing in her brain, in the centers of the brain that affect and control, logic, reasoning and, most importantly, judgment,"" attorney Eugene Iredale said at a news conference Thursday. O'Connor sat next to him with her head lowered. O'Connor didn't plead guilty this week and the charge is played in abeyance for two years, Iredale said. ""It is fair to say in the last eight to 10 years a multiple amount of tragedies have befallen a person who was a great civic leader -- one of the sweetest, funniest people who ever existed in our city's history,"" the attorney said. ""She suffered from terrible loneliness. She began around 2001 to gamble heavily."" ""Although it's not fair of us to say there is no moral culpability, Maureen acknowledges doing something she ought not to have done,"" he added. Photographs of her head after surgery show a fluid-filled cavity without brain matter at all, he said. From 2000 to 2008, O'Connor gambled in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and San Diego casinos, court papers said. In 2008, when she became nearly broke, she began to siphon off funds from the R.P. Foundation and continued the activity into 2009, court documents said. To fund her high-stakes gambling, she had liquidated her savings, sold several real estate holdings, auctioned valuables, and obtained a third mortgage on her home in La Jolla, California, the documents say. O'Connor allegedly bankrupted the foundation and tried to avoid paying federal income taxes on the charity's money by characterizing what she took as ""loans,"" court papers say. ""Despite having limited, if any, assets other than the funds misappropriated from the foundation, defendant continued high-stakes gambling,"" the documents say. By March 2009, O'Connor allegedly had paid off casinos' gambling markers, or lines of credit, but hadn't repaid the foundation, prosecutors said. She then enjoyed a streak of ""several large gambling winnings after March 2009 that were used to continue gambling, not bring the foundation out of bankruptcy,"" court papers say. Prior to 2008, the foundation funded such philanthropies as City of Hope, the Alzheimer's Association, Sharp Healthcare, Little Wishes Foundation, San Diego Hospice and the John Burton Foundation, authorities said. CNN's Jaclyn Wang contributed to this report.","NEW: Former mayor is ""a civic treasure"" in San Diego who put city on tourist map .

"(EW.com) -- When agent Aaron Cross plunges into icy waters in the opening moments of the brisk and satisfying spy thriller ""The Bourne Legacy,"" the scene serves two purposes: to commemorate the superb and well-loved trilogy that came before, in which Matt Damon, as the man called Jason Bourne, made his first appearance in ""The Bourne Identity,"" fished out of the Mediterranean Sea with bullets in his back; and to baptize Jeremy Renner as the action-hero heir worthy of leading the franchise forward. The symbolism works elegantly. Renner's Cross is a conflicted hero built to take advantage of the ""Hurt Locker"" star's best qualities as an actor â€” his default intensity, the way he conveys that complicated mental calculations are taking place under cover of watchful stillness, even underwater. Director and co-writer Tony Gilroy (""Michael Clayton"") has custom-tailored ""The Bourne Legacy"" for the present by opening up the narrative. Unnerving scenes of backroom operations among shadowy governmental and private-enterprise types reveal the machinations of a much bigger, more nefarious tangle of players than previously imagined. There are mystery men running the country â€” and, by remote control, the world. This movie recommends worrying. Meanwhile, Cross is currently the agent in the crosshairs. To his handlers he's only ""No. 5,"" one of six experimental warriors chemically enhanced for use by the Department of Defense in an operation called Outcome â€” sort of the 2.0 of the original trilogy's Treadstone. But now his masters (led by an effectively steely Edward Norton) want to eradicate all evidence that Outcome ever existed by destroying these six superagents. In desperation, he turns for help to the pharmaceutical scientist who ""created"" his enhanced capabilities (Rachel Weisz, a good choice, and from the looks of her, a good runner). Soon the two are sprinting for their lives together. Like any story with 'Bourne"" in the title, this one scampers around the globe, with a big chunk of well-crafted showdown action set in teeming Manila. Gilroy, who as a screenwriter has shaped the movie saga from the beginning, trades the wired rhythms established in the past two episodes by Paul Greengrass for something more realistic and closer to the ground.

"(CNN) -- Even before the smoke had cleared from a series of bombings in the Thai capital of Bangkok Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak blamed Iran for the incident, as well as the attacks against Israeli diplomats in Delhi and Georgia two days ago. ""The attempted terror attack in Thailand proves once again that Iran and its proxies continue to operate in the ways of terror and the latest attacks are an example of that,"" he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed. ""In recent months, we have witnessed several attempts to attack Israeli citizens and Jews in several countries, including Azerbaijan, Thailand and others. Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah, were behind all of these attempted attacks."" Was the government of Iran behind the bomb assembly operation in Bangkok? Most likely, yes. Was it part of a larger global effort to target Israeli diplomats in retaliation for the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists in Iran? Yes, again. But the three men allegedly responsible for the Bangkok bombings can hardly be considered professional, hard-core Hezbollah terrorists. The suspects were not involved in a sophisticated, state-financed terrorist attack. The bombs were poorly made and constructed. The chaotic departure from the area and the lack of operational security in entering and moving about since they entered the country indicate a relatively amateurish operation with little advance planning for contingencies. So, what is the Iranian connection? It is possible that Iran is seeking to modulate its retaliation for the murder of a number of its scientists over the past two years. For all its bluster, Iranian leaders are well aware that trigger-happy Israel is itching for a showdown over the evolving Iranian nuclear weapons program. Iran with an atomic weapon has been an Israeli ""red-line"" for several decades. And Iranian leaders, poised astride an economy reeling under yet another round of economic sanctions, can ill afford a destabilizing war with Israel (and the U.S.), particularly one they would likely lose quickly and decisively. Israel, Iran trade accusations . But outsourcing terrorist attacks on Israeli targets to semi-incompetent subcontractors gives Iran neither plausible deniability nor direct control to dial-down the scope of retaliation to avoid handing the Israelis a chance to respond strategically. It is more probable that Iranian intelligence has leveraged ""B-Team"" contacts in several countries to plan and carry out attacks against Israeli diplomats. While some support or funds might be available, the Iranian government would strive to keep its distance from farm-league terrorists putting together bombs in portable radios. The Bangkok suspects were carrying Iranian passports -- not false documents. Their movements were crude, embarrassingly overt and ended in a debacle of incompetence and bad luck. Unfortunately, Thai police investigations are not likely to shed light on the Iranian connection. Senior security officials claimed the explosions were not acts of terrorism because the bombs involved could not cause ""large-scale destruction."" Always sensitive to tarnishing Thailand's lucrative tourism sector, Thai officials are likely to continue to downplay the implications of Tuesday's explosions and seek to move the story off the media radar. On January 12, after a controversial U.S. Embassy terrorist alert was issued, Thai officials arrested Atris Hussein, after finding ""initial chemical materials that could produce bombs"" in an area just outside Bangkok. Police said Hussein, who also holds a Swedish passport, led them to the location. The authorities are accusing Hussein of trying to attack spots in Bangkok that are popular with Western tourists and say he is believed to belong to Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim group active in Lebanon that the U.S. views as a terrorist organization. Thailand's second terrorism wake-up call rang out Tuesday afternoon in Bangkok. Whether Thai officials respond or simply hit the snooze button and continue to believe ""it could never happen here,"" remains to be seen.

"(CNN) -- In Al Qaem, Iraq, the anger and despair of the refugees is palpable. Two refugee camps have been set up there, nine miles from the border with Syria. As Save the Children's Country Director, I made the dangerous 280-mile journey out to Al Qaem to help with our distribution of urgently needed newborn kits and to hear the stories of the families. Although in numbers they are fewer than their counterparts in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, their suffering and needs are no less pronounced, especially given their low profile, the extreme challenges that organizations are facing in reaching them, the lack of funding and the minimal services in the area. Save the Children is one of very few organizations supporting the more than 8,000 Syrian refugees living in very difficult circumstances in this hardly accessible area in the far western corner of Iraq. I shiver despite the noon sun. Temperatures are no more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). Thirteen-year-old Ali is stoic. ""You should be here at night to really feel it."" He beams a smile at me. I force myself to ignore the icy air. The thick baby blanket that we included in the newborn kits will come in very handy. I'm struck by the tidiness of Um Ahmed's tent. There are no possessions; just five sponge mattresses where 14 people sleep. As I sit cross-legged, the cold bites; I retreat to a kneeling position while the girls giggle shyly. These girls are attending the child-friendly space that we have helped set up for kids here. These children have been exposed to much pain, uncertainty, fear, displacement -- they really need the stability and normalcy that child-friendly spaces can offer. The stories come fast and furious. ""What have we done to deserve this? Look at our children just in T-shirts. No one has proper shoes, not even socks. My daughter-in-law had to flee for her life with seven children ... her husband is still there. He's my son; I don't know where or how he is."" Um Ahmed's daughters and their friends fill the tent with their stories -- of children's dirty clothes, of not showering in more than four weeks, of water too muddy to even make tea. The baby is crying. Her cheeks are swollen and yellowish as are those of many of the older children. ""Al Sfar"" (jaundice), confirms Um Ahmed. She says the clinic offers no help. One mother hugs her 3-year-old daughter. ""I'm just watching my child get sicker every day and there is nothing I can do."" Another woman, Intisar, wordlessly pulls the base of the tent out to show me how damp the gravel is under the tent. ""It seeps into those sponge mattresses, into our bones, into our skin. There is no way of staying warm or dry."" Her husband shows me the deep crevice dug by their resident rats. ""All night they crawl under us, trying to get warmth. The children scream, and I spend all night beating the rats out."" As I walk out, the tears rise in me. It hurts to look into the despair on the children's faces, to see a toddler barefoot on the gravel. There is so much that needs to be done. Without support these children truly suffer. As winter tightens its grip on Syria's neighboring countries, stories like those I heard in Al Qaem are far from unique. UNHCR estimates that the number of refugee children in the region has surpassed 250,000, and that number continues to climb. They lack medical care, adequate food, warmth and clean water. In Al Qaem, Save the Children has already provided hygiene kits for all families, 430 newborn kits and is helping 520 children through the child-friendly spaces. Regionally, Save the Children has reached 80,000 children and families so far and is working to triple our response in Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. As with all other organizations responding to the humanitarian needs of the Syrian refugees in the region, our greatest challenge is funding. We are on the ground. We have established operations in Al Qaem, which is no small feat. We are ready to deliver aid immediately but we need the funds to make it happen. That night, I cannot get warm, despite the blankets and thick walls. I cannot stop thinking of the children, out in the desert cold.

"Washington (CNN) -- Whether a political ploy or bona fide proposal, a leaked version of President Barack Obama's draft immigration plan raised Republican hackles while bringing some additional focus to the debate. The draft plan reported over the weekend by USA Today and confirmed to CNN by an administration official included a possible path to coveted permanent residency in eight years for most of the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. It also called for steps to strengthen border security and the E-Verify system to check the immigration status of workers. GOP critics pounced, with some objecting to any form of what they label ""amnesty"" for those in the country illegally. Others accused Obama and the White House of dirty tricks by going public with their draft as a bipartisan group of senators works on a possible agreement. Conservative Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama complained on Monday that both the Obama draft and the talks involving the Senate's so-called Gang of Eight seek to ""confer legal status and work authorization on Day One in exchange for promises of future enforcement on which this administration will never deliver."" ""Perhaps this leak, and what it reveals, may mark the beginning of the collapse of this new scheme to force through a fatally flawed plan,"" Sessions said in a statement. Others accused Obama of deliberately floating an unacceptable plan so that Republicans would reject it, bringing the party further disfavor from Hispanic Americans, the nation's fastest-growing demographic. ""Does the president want a result, or does he want another cudgel to beat up Republicans so that he can get political advantage in the next election?"" veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" To former Rep. Connie Mack, a Florida Republican, ""a little bit of this is show from everyone, including the president's side."" Regardless of how it happened, the leak of Obama's plan ""plays into the fears"" of Republicans that the president prefers keeping the issue alive for political advantage, Mack told CNN on Monday. His wife -- former Republican Rep. Mary Bono Mack of California -- agreed that the leak added to what she called an already deep trust deficit in Washington. ""The American people would be astonished if they knew how little trust existed between the two parties when we have to work together like this,"" Bono Mack said on CNN. She acknowledged tossing the president's plan into the debate was ""a good way to move a bill."" ""You know, come out farther to the left, make the room on the right,"" Bono Mack said. ""But in this case, start with that trust."" Administration officials insisted Obama wanted Congress to work out an agreement that can win support from both parties. ""We will be prepared with our own plans if these ongoing talks between Republicans and Democrats up on Capitol Hill break down,"" Obama's new chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""There's no evidence that they have broken down yet. We are continuing to support that."" He added that he hoped the two sides ""don't get involved in some kind of typical Washington back-and-forth sideshow here and rather just ... roll up their sleeves and get to work"" on writing a comprehensive immigration bill. Along with the Senate talks on possible legislation, House members from both parties also are involved in their own discussions. The draft plan reported by USA Today calls for an eight-year path to permanent residency for undocumented immigrants, who would face a criminal background check and have to pay back taxes, learn English and get a new ""lawful prospective immigrant"" visa. On the day after last week's State of the Union address, in which Obama called for comprehensive immigration reform, he met with the four Democratic senators involved in the Gang of Eight talks to reiterate what he considers to be the main principles for a final agreement. According to the White House, those principles include ""continuing to strengthen border security, creating an earned path to citizenship, holding employers accountable and streamlining legal immigration."" Republicans stung by the overwhelming support for Obama from Latino voters that helped the president win re-election in November are divided over how to proceed on immigration. Conservatives generally oppose any breaks for those who came to America illegally although some, like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, contend the party must adopt a modern approach to an issue with such strong economic and social impacts. Rubio, who gave the GOP response to Obama's State of the Union address, displayed the party's conflicted posture on the issue that night. He didn't mention his past support of a route to legal status for undocumented immigrants now in the United States, but advocated a non-specific ""responsible, permanent solution to the problem."" First, he said, ""we must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws."" When news of the leaked Obama proposal emerged, Rubio immediately criticized it as ""disappointing to those of us working on a serious solution."" On the Democratic side, some of the distrust noted by Bono Mack is evident. Remembering similar bipartisan talks on major issues, such as the Gang of Six that spent months working on a health care overhaul in 2009 without every reaching an agreement, they want to make sure Congress gets legislation to consider. ""I know that Senator Rubio was upset with this leak,"" Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York told CNN on Sunday. ""I am not upset. We've talked to Senator Rubio and he is fully on board with our process. And I am very hopeful that in March we will have a bipartisan bill."" Schumer said the mechanics of politics was obvious: ""If a Democrat, the president or anyone else puts out what they want on their own, it's going to be different than what you have (in) a bipartisan agreement, but the only way we're going to get something done is with a bipartisan agreement."" CNN's Jessica Yellin, Gregory Wallace, Kevin Bohn, Juan Carlos Lopez, Ashley Killough and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Leaked draft of President Obama's immigration plan sparks uproar .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The Thai parliament elected the nation's first female prime minister Friday, with more than half the lawmakers backing her vote. Yingluck Shinawatra has to be proclaimed by the nation's king before she can officially take office. If King Bhumibol Adulyadej proclaims her, she will be the 28th prime minister in Thai history. Yingluck won 296 votes in the nearly 500-member parliament. ""The first thing I want to do is help people on their economic situation,"" she said last month. Yingluck is the younger sister of one of Thailand's most polarizing political figures, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup. He left the country two years later after being convicted on conflict of interest charges -- accusations he denies. Yingluck's critics worry she will do her brother's bidding -- something she has denied. ""There is a lot more hard work to do in the future for the well-being of our sisters and brothers, the people of Thailand,"" she said last month. ""There are many things to accomplish to make reconciliation possible, paving the way for a solid foundation for a flourishing nation."" Tensions between the Democratic Party and the Pheu Thai party, which reflect deep divisions within Thai society, erupted last year, leading to a military crackdown. More than 90 people were killed and hundreds were injured. After the riots, the Thai government pledged to work toward national reconciliation to heal class and political divisions, though the divide between the two groups remains wide.

"(CNN) -- The coach of four-time major winner Ernie Els has urged golf's governing bodies to come to a quick decision on the proposed banning of anchored putting. Golf's rulemakers Royal & Ancient (R & A) and the United States Golf Association (USGA), which governs the game in the U.S. and Mexico, announced in November they intend to ban the method of putting by which a club is anchored to a part of the body by 2016. The decision has been backed by the European Tour, but Tim Finchem, commissioner of the lucrative U.S.-based PGA Tour, opposes the rule change which would essentially outlaw the controversial ""belly putter"". Els is one of a clutch of recent major winners who favor using the belly putter -- three of the last five majors have been won by a player using the technique. Els' coach Claude Harmon III has called for a solution to be found soon in order to protect the integrity of the game. ""They have to make a decision quickly,"" Harmon told CNN's Living Golf. ""Brandt Snedeker, who's easily the best putter on the planet, got up and said to Tim, 'You've got to make a decision now. ""If we let this thing continue for three or four more years the guys that are still using the long putter are still going to be winning golf tournaments and then do we put a asterisk, is there a stigma attached to that. ""The longer this keeps going and they still can't find a decision, a guy like Keegan Bradley, does he practice and waste time away from his game to try and do something or does he just continue to do what he is really good at?"" Bradley and fellow American Webb Simpson both used the anchored putting technique to win the PGA Championship in 2011 and 2012 respectively. Harmon joined Finchem in questioning whether the method offered players an advantage over more conventional putting techniques. ""None of the best putters in the world use a belly putter and I know from talking to guys like Ernie, like Keegan Bradley and Webb Simpson, I think they do feel a little bit that there's a target on their back,"" added Harmon. ""I think it is going to be very hard to quantify with data an advantage that a belly putter gives players. ""The PGA Tour and the European Tour and golf at a professional level is a sport absolutely, but it is also a business. ""For me what Tim Finchem is trying to do is say to the governing bodies, this is just my opinion, that if you're going to make decisions that affect the professional game you have to involve the professional game."" Former world No. 1 Martin Kaymer, who uses a traditional putter, also wants to see the issue put to bed. ""I'm a little tired of it,"" 2010 PGA championship winner Kaymer told CNN. ""Everybody should make a decision and we move on. All the speculation now is a little bit too much. ""The PGA Tour, the R & A, the European Tour, they should sit down and make a decision together."" Kevin Garside, of British newspaper The Independent, suggests the reintroduction of golf at the 2016 Olympic Games means anchored putting will be banned, despite U.S. resistance. ""I think it's clear where this is going,"" said Garside. ""You can't get this far and then say, 'OK, as you were.' The putter is going to be banned. ""The Olympic Games is coming up, you can't have an anchored putter at the Olympic Games. It's as simple as that."" According to Bob Harig of ESPN.com, the PGA Tour will have to back down in order to avoid a division within the sport. ""You can't have different rules,"" Harig said. ""They're going to have to fall in line with whatever the USGA and R & A do. ""It would be chaotic if the PGA Tour wrote their own rule on this, which they've never done. It would be a major departure.""","Ernie Els' coach calls for a decision on anchored putting .

"(CNN) -- World No.3 Luke Donald missed the halfway cut for the first time in his career after failing to shine at the rain-delayed Malaysia Open. Donald recorded rounds of 73 and 74, leaving him three shots off the cut mark after enduring troubles with his putter. But the Englishman, who is still seeking his first Major title, is confident he will be back on form for the U.S. Masters at Augusta next month. ""I've got a couple of weeks off to get ready for Augusta and I'll obviously be very diligent in my preparation,"" Donald told reporters. ""I would have loved to go back home in form, but in golf you just never know. We've seen it many times before when people go into tournaments with very little form and win, including majors.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- A Malaysian court has ruled that an Iranian man suspected of being involved with a series of bombs that went off in Bangkok in February can be extradited to Thailand. Masoud Sedaghatzadeh is wanted by the Thai authorities for his alleged involvement in the Bangkok blasts along with several other Iranians. It is not yet clear when Sedaghatzadeh will be extradited, as he plans to file an application to a higher court in Malaysia, seeking his release from prison. The explosions in Bangkok did not cause any deaths, but the Thai authorities have said they were intended for Israeli diplomats. The devices used explosive materials that are not available in Thailand and were most likely smuggled in, the police have said. The Bangkok blasts came a day after a device attached to an Israeli Embassy van in New Delhi exploded, and another device, found on an embassy car in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, was safety detonated. Israeli officials blamed Iran for the attacks, but Tehran has denied the accusations. On Monday, the Malaysian judge, Justice S.M Komathy Suppiah, ruled that Sedaghatzadeh be remanded in prison for as many as 15 days, pending an extradition order from the Minister of Home Affairs. ""In my view, the conduct of the respondent is inconsistent with that of an innocent man,"" she said, referring to Sedaghatzadeh. ""I'm allowing the application for extradition and the respondent is to be detained in prison pending an order from the minister for his render."" The Malaysian prosecutor, Kamal Baharin Omar, said Sedaghatzadeh, 31, was arrested at Kuala Lumpur airport on February 15, a day after one of the bombs went off at a house in Bangkok. Mr. Kamal said the Thai police had CCTV footage showing Sedaghatzadeh entering and leaving the house where the explosives were detonated. He questioned why Sedaghatzadeh would leave the house and flee to Kuala Lumpur if he was not connected to the explosives. ""All the actions subsequent to the explosion do not show the innocence of the respondent,"" he said. Sedaghatzadeh's lawyer, Mohamad Nashir Hussin, argued that the Thai police had not been able to show that the respondent was involved in the incident. ""There's no evidence that the respondent had any contact or had even seen the explosives in the house,"" he said. Sedaghatzadeh, who was handcuffed and dressed in a polo shirt and jeans, told the court that he would file a habeas corpus, an application asking to be released from prison. ""I require more time to defend myself,"" he said through a translator. The Thai authorities have detained two Iranian suspects in the case: Saeid Moradi, 28, whose legs were blown off by his own bomb; and Mohammad Khazaei, 42, who was taken into custody at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport as he tried to board a plane to Malaysia. Both are being held at a Bangkok prison until their next court appearance. They and Sedaghatzadeh face charges that include joint assembly of explosive devices, joint possession of explosive devices without permits and causing an explosion injuring other persons. Moradi also faces charges of attempted killing of state officials on duty and the intentional attempted killing of other persons. Two other suspects in the case are still at large, according to Gen. Pansiri Prapawat, the deputy national police chief who is heading the investigation into the bombings. They are Nikkahfard Javad, a 52-year-old Iranian man, and Rohani Leila, an Iranian woman. Thailand has issued an arrest warrant for the suspects and sent their names to Interpol's wanted list, Pansiri said.","The Iranian suspect is wanted by the Thai authorities in relation to a string of blasts in Bangkok .

"(CNN) -- When I think of Brooklyn, I think of Christopher Wallace -- known to most as the Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie Smalls -- the artist whose life was cut short 15 years ago on March 9. For others, Brooklyn might call to mind the retro-cool style, hipness and youthful vibrancy that have become associated with the borough, an image that's been aided by entertainment. Yet whatever cultural shifts the borough sees through time, its relevancy doesn't waver. While there, you can still feel the presence of B.I.G.'s lyrics: ""...spread love, it's the Brooklyn way."" I first met B.I.G. at a Clive Davis event at the Plaza hotel in June of 1994. It was for Arista employees to welcome our new joint venture with Sean ""Puff Daddy"" (as he was known back then) Combs and his Bad Boy label. Puff introduced me to B.I.G. as the guy who was going to get his records played on radio. His words were few, but his presence and stature were massive. A head nod, a handshake and an acknowledgment conveying it was ""all good."" He was the epitome of Brooklyn cool, but the world didn't know it yet. At the time, hip-hop was not getting played on mainstream radio -- my job was to get B.I.G. there. Over the next two years, I would travel the country, taking B.I.G. to radio stations, lunches and promotional shows, introducing him to new audiences. Crossing over into mainstream didn't apply to the then-22-year-old rapper in the way it does for many artists that do so today. Artists who made hip-hop were not invited to awards shows, fashion shows or the White House like they are now. In 1994, America as a whole still seemed uneasy with the genre. But instead of conforming to appeal to the mainstream, B.I.G. creatively figured out ways to be authentic. That authenticity, combined with his talent, brought mass appeal. And when he did breakthrough, subsequently opening doors for other rappers to benefit from his success, he never compromised that authenticity. He was always proud of his hometown of Brooklyn, never forgetting where he came from as his success took him elsewhere. Even if the mainstream didn't know it yet at the time, Brooklyn for many years has been the breeding ground for many of today's top lawyers, doctors, celebrities and athletes. B.I.G. was proud of where he came from, showed it in his music and found success through his embrace of his roots. Maybe the most poignant analogy that B.I.G. made in his music was a reference that he's the ""rap Alfred Hitchcock."" As Andrew Noz points out in our annual ICON issue of The FADER that was dedicated to the Notorious B.I.G. (Issue No. 73, April 2011): ""The boast may have been a simple comment on how B.I.G.'s rotund figure projected a silhouette similar to the filmmaker, but there's a deeper spiritual bond between the two -- the detail obsession of full-blown perfectionists."" He goes on to highlight, ""Equally mind-blowing is how these skills came to be, borne practically from nothing. B.I.G. entered the game as a fully formed rapper, with seemingly no blemishes on his track record."" It's vital to point out that B.I.G. ascended from Brooklyn, and every experience in his life contributed to his outputs. Much like Hitchcock, B.I.G. was able to express his thoughts with objective and subjective points of view seemingly without effort. He expressed his views on what he saw, from the perils of the streets to ""eating shrimp a la carte, with some [women] from Brussels, eating clams or mussels [from the track, 'My Downfall']"". Creating an audio road map complete with visuals, he rhymed in intricate detail about everything from elaborate heists, to taking revenge on enemies, to bank accounts in Brazil, all without letting go of the place that shaped him -- bringing it with him wherever he went. And the neighborhood loved him back. Following B.I.G.'s death at 24 on March 9, 1997, the man who proclaimed he was ""Ready to Die"" was mourned in Brooklyn as a funeral procession made its way through the streets of his youth. As I said in our FADER tribute to my friend, I've often wondered what B.I.G. would think of all the coverage he has gotten over the years. I think he'd appreciate the cultural impact he has had. He'd want Brooklyn represented the right way, for his crew to be acknowledged and for the world to know that he was very aware, a stand-up guy, a jokester, a caring father and son, and extremely determined. With that in mind, we should celebrate his life -- and spread love the Brooklyn way.","Rob Stone on his friend Notorious B.I.G: ""I first met B.I.G. at a Clive Davis event""

"Yaounde, Cameroon (CNN) -- French military and intelligence officers have entered northern Cameroon in search of a family of seven French tourists kidnapped Tuesday from a national park, a CNN affiliate reported Wednesday. The Paris-based private network BFMTV did not cite its source; it posted a team of journalists Wednesday in Paris at the French Foreign Ministry Crisis Center, which is handling the country's response to the crisis. BFMTV, citing the French Defense Ministry, said gendarmes had been sent to the site in northern Cameroon where the abduction occurred to investigate. But a Cameroonian official said Wednesday that he believed the family had been taken across the border into neighboring Nigeria within hours of their abduction. Joseph Dion Ngute, the Foreign Ministry official in charge of ties with Commonwealth nations, said Tuesday's incident marked the first time foreigners in Cameroon had been taken captive by suspected Islamic militants of Nigeria's Boko Haram movement. ""The intentions of the kidnappers are yet to be known,"" he said. French officials blamed the incident on Boko Haram, which has taken advantage of Nigeria's porous borders with Chad and Cameroon in its three-year campaign. Boko Haram has waged a war against Nigeria's government and its Christian population in an effort to establish a strict Islamic state in northern Nigeria. The family was kidnapped from Waza National Park, a thickly forested area of northern Cameroon popular among tourists and located near the border with Nigeria. The incident has raised fears of Westerners being targeted by Islamist militant groups in Africa in the wake of France's military intervention in Mali. But French President Francois Hollande said Tuesday that he didn't believe the seizure was linked to his government's intervention in Mali, where French troops have joined government forces to battle Islamic militants linked to al Qaeda. ""I am aware of the presence of Boko Haram in that part of Cameroon, and that's worrying enough,"" Hollande said. The abductees include four children ages 5 to 12, their parents and an uncle, the Cameroon's state broadcaster CRTV reported. Fonkam Azu, governor Cameroon's northern region of Maroua, told reporters that residents saw the hostages being driven into Nigeria on motorcycles. The father works for the French company GDF Suez and is based in Yaounde, the capital in southern Cameroon. GDF Suez, which is developing a natural gas liquefaction project in Cameroon, said it was working closely with the French Foreign Ministry. Concerns about border security in northern Cameroon grew early last year, when Sudanese poachers on horseback invaded the Bouba Ndjida Park and killed more than 300 elephants for their ivory. Afterward, the government temporarily replaced park guards with a special anti-terrorist squad of the military. In a statement, Cameroon's Ministry of External Relations said Wednesday that security has been tightened to guarantee the safety of expatriates and tourists, especially in volatile regions. Abductions are common in Cameroon, especially in natural resource-rich regions. In January, kidnappers killed one Chinese national and abducted three others from the Betare Oya gold mine in the country's south. The military freed the surviving hostages. And several abductions targeting foreigners have occurred in the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula, on the country's Atlantic coast. Amanpour: Nigeria battles to stop al Queda chaos in Africa .

"(Rolling Stone) -- ""There is a great deal of sadness, but it's really celebratory,"" R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills says, describing his conflicting emotions the day after he, guitarist Peter Buck and singer Michael Stipe announced they were disbanding after 31 years together. ""There is sadness because I will never play on the same stage as Peter and Michael again."" Yet, Mills insists, ""We're doing this for good reasons, and we end up looking back at all the fun, the joy and the incredible opportunities we had."" So why is America's biggest alternative-rock band breaking up now? ""It's not because we have to or we can't stand each other or we suck,"" Mills contends. ""We're happy. But we're done."" Mills, Buck and Stipe issued the news of their split without warning on September 21st, in a statement posted on R.E.M.'s website. ""A wise man once said, 'The skill in attending a party is knowing when it's time to leave,' "" Stipe wrote. ""We built something extraordinary together. . . . Now we're going to walk away from it."" ""It was very unexpected,"" says Rob Cavallo, the chairman of Warner Bros. Records, the band's label. He found out ""the same morning that the press release went on their website,"" in a phone call from R.E.M. manager Bertis Downs. ""I can't believe they're breaking up, but I understand,"" Cavallo says. ""They're too pure, too respectful of their own thing."" R.E.M. actually made their decision a few months ago, before they met in Athens, Georgia, this summer to record three new songs for a two-CD greatest-hits package, ""R.E.M., Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage"" 1982- 2011, out November 15th. The band delayed the announcement because ""a lot of people are affected by this decision in a serious way,"" Mills says, referring to R.E.M.'s staff and crew. ""We wanted everything set up the way it should be. ""And we were excited to find three really good songs to put out as a farewell,"" he adds. Two of the new tracks, ""Hallelujah"" and ""A Month of Saturdays,"" came from demos for R.E.M.'s last studio album, ""Collapse Into Now,"" released in March. The third song, a Sixties-flavored treat with sunshine-pop brass, is called, aptly, ""We All Go Back to Where We Belong."" It comes out as a single October 18th. Mills can't remember when he, Buck and Stipe began seriously talking about the end of the band. ""But it was discussed on the 2008 tour,"" he says, and during the sessions for Collapse Into Now. The group was coming to the end of its Warner Bros. deal and chose not to tour behind that record. There are ""indications"" on the album, Mills notes, citing Stipe's ""lyrical content"" in ""All the Best."" ""There are some straightforward see-you-laters on that one. ""It might have been talked about in more general terms before that,"" Mills suggests. ""We'd say things like, 'We have X number of records in the contract. By the time we finish, we'll be X number of years old. Do we still want to be out there flogging it?' "" Ironically, R.E.M.'s disappointing 2004 album, ""Around the Sun,"" made Mills, Stipe and Buck determined to stick around long enough to redeem themselves. ""We needed to prove, not only to our fans and critics but to ourselves, that we could still make great records,"" Mills says, ""and we made two"" -- Accelerate, released in 2008, and Collapse Into Now. ""We thought, 'We've done it. Now let's do something no other band has done: Shake hands and walk away as friends.' "" R.E.M. formed in Athens in 1980 with drummer Bill Berry and issued their debut single, ""Radio Free Europe,"" in July 1981. Through heavy touring, growing airplay and a stunning creative evolution -- from the jangling enigma of 1983's Murmur to the complex and commercial dynamics of 1987's Document and 1991's Out of Time -- R.E.M. became American rock's biggest grass-roots-success story. The day after R.E.M. broke up, Cavallo was on the phone with Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong: ""Billie said R.E.M. were the first underground band he saw that conquered the mainstream. He was 13 years old, and it changed his perception of what rock could be."" Berry quit in 1997, after suffering a brain aneurysm on tour two years earlier. The others continued while doing side projects, which they will now pursue full-time. Stipe is a film producer and active in visual arts. Buck has a long discography as a sideman for cult heroes such as Robyn Hitchcock and the Decemberists. R.E.M.'s 15 studio albums have sold more than 85 million copies worldwide, and the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. But Mills says R.E.M.'s greatest accomplishment was that ""we conducted ourselves with as much integrity as possible. We showed people you can conduct your operation on your own terms and be successful. ""In fact,"" he adds, ""you'll have a much better time and sleep better at night.""

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A restaurateur has gone to great lengths to tackle the spread of the H1N1 virus in his eatery, including taking staff's temperatures before they start work and preventing them from touching plates directly. Kitchen staff at Silk and Soya restaurant in Spain wear face masks and gloves while preparing food. Silk and Soya, a Thai-themed restaurant in Madrid, Spain, implemented the measures to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, in the upscale locale. ""We implemented these measures so that our employees would serve only food, not a virus,"" restaurant owner Cipri Quintas told CNN.   As well as employees having their temperatures taken before starting their shifts, windows are opened to aerate the restaurant before meals. Each table is set at least one meter -- 3.2 feet -- from any other table.   Any member of the kitchen staff involved in food preparation must wear a mask and gloves, and waiters are required to hold napkins when carrying plates to avoid touching them directly with their hands. Upon entering the elevators leading to the top-floor restaurant, customers find an automatic disinfectant gel dispenser.  At each table, diners find a packet of gel next to their silverware. The restaurant's restroom doors are propped open, the lights turn on automatically and the faucets are hands-free -- measures intended to keep customers from having to touch surfaces after they've washed their hands.   Similar initiatives are under way around the world. Last spring, during the peak of the scare in Mexico City, restaurants were closed for 12 days. When the restaurants reopened, the government ordered owners to put extra space between the tables and not to allow more than half of seats to be filled at any given time; cooks and waiters were mandated to wear surgical masks.   The World Health Organization's Web site states that hand-washing is one of the best ways to prevent infection and provides instructions with drawings that can be printed and posted in public places, such as restaurants. Silk and Soya's Quintas started his anti-H1N1 measures in August and has already proved popular with some customers. Simona Savin, who was having lunch, told CNN, ""These are measures you don't see everywhere. Here you have everything. They are great because there's a need for hygiene.""   Another diner, swimming coach Fernando Barea, said, ""We came to the restaurant because we heard good things about it and I wanted to see these measures against the H1N1 flu. These measures should be used by other restaurants.""   Quintas predicted they soon will be. ""People from other businesses like hotels and theaters have called us asking, 'What have you done? Can we come see your setup?' There's been a big response,"" said Quintas.   He insisted that his goal is not solely to garner publicity, but to protect his customers and staff -- a responsibility, he said, that the business community at large should undertake.   One expert on the disease applauded the efforts and recommended they be broadened.  ""They should implement them every winter against all respiratory diseases,"" said Dr. Tom Jefferson, a medical epidemiologist with the Cochrane Collaboration. The international organization reviews health care interventions and ""promotes the search for evidence in the form of clinical trials and other studies of interventions,"" according to its Web site.   As of September 13, the WHO had tallied more than 296,000 cases worldwide, 3,486 of them fatal.","Thai-themed restaurant in Madrid implements anti H1N1 flu measures .

"(CNN) -- The man known as the ""American Taliban"" won a legal fight that will allow him and fellow Muslim inmates to gather for daily prayers. A federal judge ruled Friday that the warden at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, was violating John Walker Lindh's rights by not allowing the religious activities. Lindh argued that before 2007 Muslim prisoners were allowed to pray together for at least three of Islam's five daily prayers. Since then, with the exception of the holy month of Ramadan, the Muslim prisoners are allowed to gather only once a week. The unit Lindh is housed in has 55 cells, and the majority of the prisoners are Muslim, according to court documents. By not allowing group prayer, while at the same time allowing other group activities such as board games, the warden was violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson found. The law was designed to protect freedom of religion in prison, where policies can place burdens on such rights. The judge ordered an injunction ""prohibiting the warden from enforcing the policy against daily congregate prayer for Muslims, including Mr. Lindh, for whom daily congregate prayer is a sincerely held religious belief,"" the court order states. Already, prisoners are allowed to gather in the unit's multi-purpose room to listen or watch recording of Quran verses. Allowing them to pray is not significantly different from this and should be allowed, the judge ruled. Lindh, who was born in California, converted to Islam as a teenager. He traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 and attended a terror training camp where he was introduced to Osama bin Laden. Lindh was captured by the Afghan Northern Alliance on November 25, 2001, and imprisoned in a compound in Mazar-e-Sharif, where he was questioned by CIA agent Johnny Michael Spann, who was killed in an uprising at the compound a short time later. As part of a deal, Lindh pleaded guilty to supplying services to the Taliban and carrying an explosive during the commission of a felony. His family filed a petition for clemency to commute the 20-year sentence, a request that was denied by President George W. Bush in one of his final acts in office. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","John Walker Lindh is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison .

"(CNN) -- At this point in my life, at the wizened age of 69, I've managed to run 123 marathons -- and I'm happy to say I'm still going strong. But things could have turned out differently for me. In fact, my first marathon was almost my last. It was 1981. I was a pretty strong runner but had never really attempted that kind of distance before. A friend of mine challenged me to give the Detroit Marathon a try. I was young, cocky and pretty stupid. I trained only sporadically, went out way too fast at the start of the race and spent the last 10 miles feeling like I was going to die. By the time I finished, I had vowed never to run another marathon again -- and promptly ran my second one the following year, because I couldn't resist the challenge of overcoming my mistakes and my conviction that I could do better. But I was lucky. Aside from being frustrated and overwhelmed, I easily could've injured myself, which would have put an end to my running completely. Of course, my problems all started with not training properly, and if you're serious about running, your first marathon training is key. But there are a million good training schedules out there, and at this point you've probably seen most of them. What I'd like to talk about is what you can do during the race to ensure your success -- not just so that you finish, but that you feel reasonably good doing it. Good enough that you'll be back for more. Here are five things I've learned since that first miserable experience: . 1. Pacing . As I learned that first day, pacing is critical. Start slower than you think you need to go -- that initial adrenaline rush will make you want to go out at a sprint, but that will only drain you for the rest of the race. Bonus: A good way to figure out a healthy pace for your first marathon is to run a 10K at least a month in advance. Take your 10K time and multiply it by five. That should give you a pretty accurate predictor for your marathon time. So if you run a 55-minute 10K, shoot for a 4:35 marathon (275 minutes). 2. Walking . Mixing walking with running is a great way to get through a marathon and still feel strong doing it. At each water station, try walking for 30 to 60 seconds. There usually is a water station at each mile. You'll conserve your energy, and your finish time will actually improve. 3. Talking . I know this sounds crazy, but talking to other runners during a race can be really helpful. Keeping your mind off the pain is important, and engaging in conversation is a great way to do that. If you're too out of breath to talk, you're running too fast. Listening to music is another good way to stay focused, but in my experience is far less interesting. 4. Stretching . Stretching and warming up before a race is really important for preventing injury. There are many good stretching guides available on the Internet. I also highly recommend yoga. Of course, you can't do yoga during a race, but try to fit in one to two hours a week during training. Positions like Warrior pose or down dog increase strength and flexibility in your entire core, and running a marathon isn't just about your legs -- it's about your whole body. 5. Experimenting . Don't do it! This sounds like common sense, but you don't know how many runners I've talked to who get a brilliant idea to try something completely different on the day of a marathon -- be it new shoes, socks, drinks or energy gels. For the big race, stick with the rituals and gear you know and trust. Save the new stuff for something easy, like a 5K. Happy running! Stick with it, and I'll see you in Boston.","Training is key when preparing for your first marathon, runner says .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The Thai police are seeking more suspects in connection with the series of bombs that went off in Bangkok last week as they try to piece together the facts in a murky affair that has fueled accusations between Israel and Iran. A court on Monday issued an arrest warrant for Norouzi Shayan Ali Akbar, a 57-year-old Iranian man, on charges of possession and assembly of explosive devices. It is the fifth court warrant in the investigation so far. The police plan to request another warrant for an unidentified sixth suspect but do not have enough evidence at the moment, said Gen. Pansiri Prapawat, the deputy national police chief who is heading the investigation into the bombings. Police officials are no longer talking about Nikkhahfard Javad, a man they said last week they were going to seek an arrest warrant for. The Bangkok blasts went off a day after a device attached to an Israeli Embassy van in New Delhi exploded, wounding several people. Another device, found on an embassy car in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, was safety detonated. The Thai National Security Council has drawn a tentative link between the bombs in Bangkok and those in India and Georgia, saying the materials used in the explosive devices were similar. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Tehran for the attacks. But Iran has denied the accusation, saying that ""Israeli agents are often the perpetrators of such terrorist acts."" The Indian police remained tight lipped about their investigations into the New Delhi explosion. ""I am sorry that cannot be discussed,"" P.N. Aggarwal, the chief of the police unit looking into the attack, said when asked about any possible leads in the case. Indian officers have not so far named Iranians as possible suspects. Thai authorities have said that three Iranian suspects have been detained: Saeid Moradi, 28, whose legs were blown off by his own bomb; and Mohammad Khazaei, 42, who was taken into custody Tuesday at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport as he tried to board a plane to Malaysia. Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, 31, was arrested Wednesday by Malaysian authorities in Kuala Lumpur. Thailand is seeking to have him extradited. All three face charges that include joint assembling of explosive devices, joint possession of explosive devices without permits and causing an explosion injuring other persons. Moradi also faces charges of attempted killing of state officials on duty and the intentional attempted killing of other persons. A fourth Iranian, a woman identified as Rohani Leila, remains at large. She is suspected of renting the house where the first device exploded. The police on Monday took Khazaei, wearing handcuffs and a bullet proof vest, to a number of different places in Bangkok, including where the bombs went off, as part of their investigation. Dressed in shorts and sandals, Khazaei was then escorted to a busy train station where he was seen pointing out different areas to detectives for at least 20 minutes. CNN's Harmeet Singh and Anna Coren contributed to this report.","A Thai court issues a fifth arrest warrant in relation to bombings in Bangkok last week .

"(CNN) -- From luxury hotels in colossal tower blocks to traditional ""ryokan"" and functional capsule hotels, there's plenty of variety in Tokyo's hotel scene. Sample the salaryman lifestyle at the Capsule Inn Akihabara. If you can afford it -- and you probably can't -- you owe it to yourself to stay at the Peninsula Hotel (1-8-1 Yurakucho, Chiyoda-ku). As well as overlooking the Imperial Palace, what makes this hotel so special is the incredible array of high-tech mod cons in the rooms. There are wall panels that show the outdoor weather conditions, in-room nail dryers and espresso machines and, best of all, the toilets have a heated, self-lifting seat and built-in power deodorizer -- ingenious. Another top-end option is the Park Hyatt (3-7-1-2 Nishi Shinjuku), immediately recognizable as the setting for the movie ""Lost in Translation."" The hotel occupies floors 41 to 52 of the Shinjuku Park Tower, and with breathtaking views over the city and towards Mount Fuji, its popularity with visiting celebrities is understandable. A more economical option is the Park Hotel Tokyo (Shiodome Media Tower, 1-7-1, Higashi Shimbashi), which also has great views, along with modern, unfussy rooms. The hotel even employs ""Pillow Fitter"" staff to make sure you get a good night's sleep. Marunouchi Hotel (1-6-30 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku) has comfortable rooms and is surprisingly luxurious for a business hotel. A ""ryokan"" is a traditional Japanese-style inn, often featuring communal baths and rooms with futons and ""tatami"" (straw mat) flooring. They also tend to be cheaper than regular hotels. Family-run Ryokan Sawanoya (2-3-11 Yanaka, Taito-ku) is cheap and homely. The English-speaking owner is exceptionally helpful and keen to immerse you in Japanese culture. If you're lucky, his family will put on a tea ceremony or lion dance for your viewing pleasure. Ryokan Asakusa Shigetsu (1-31-11 Asakusa, Taito-ku) is a more expensive but more traditional option. Most rooms have private bathrooms but it's worth using the communal baths just for the views of the nearby five-storied pagoda. 'Western-style' rooms are also available. If you're on a tight budget, or just curious, you could always try a 'capsule' hotel, where guests sleep in coffin-sized capsules, just big enough to sit up in. Aimed primarily at workers too tired or too drunk to make it home, capsule hotels are only really suitable for single-night stays. Asakusa Riverside Capsule Hotel (2-20-4 Kaminarimon, Taito-ku), with a women-only floor, is one of the few capsule hotels in Tokyo that allows female guests. You'll be provided with a dressing gown and toothbrush and you'll have access to communal bathing facilities. Be sure to take earplugs, as the snores of drunken salarymen won't do much for your beauty sleep.

"(CNN) -- Workers in Thailand are racing against time Thursday to shore-up protective floodwalls in Bangkok with sandbags and mud to stop the country's devastating floods from engulfing parts of the capital. So far, 281 people have been killed and two people are missing in Thailand, according to the government website Thaiflood.com. Some 61 of the country's 76 provinces have so far been affected, impacting more than eight million people. More than 500,000 square kilometers -- an area the size of Spain -- are affected by the floods in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, according to CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. Asia's wet and wild summer explained . Following significant floods in Thailand's northern and central plains, Bangkok is now being hit, where officials and citizens are scurrying to beef up prevention measures as waterways, including the main Chao Phraya River, become bloated by rising water. ""Between seven and eight billion cubic meters of water a day is being released from the Bhumibol dam in the north of the country, which is heavily affecting provinces like Nahkon Sawan and Ayutthaya,"" government official Wim Rungwattanajinda tells CNN. ""From that, about one to 1.2 billion cubic meters of water is reaching Bangkok every day."" Wim believes that inner city Bangkok will not flood and is confident the defenses that have been built will hold, though he's worried about a low weather depression that's expected to arrive in the next couple of days. ""It's a race against time, as Bangkok is only two meters above sea level,"" reports CNN's Paula Hancocks. ""Of particular concern is that the waters that are coming down from the north may merge with predicted high tides from the south, expected from Thursday onwards."" Thailand flood warnings: Crocodiles, snakes and centipedes . Hancocks also reports that the country's economy may be badly affected from the floods. Manufacturing areas just north of Bangkok have been particularly hard hit hard, including a Honda factory that has been submerged ruining hundreds of cars. The giant Rojana Industrial Park has also halted operations for the time being, director Amara Charoengitwattanagun told state-run news agency MCOT, and the facility may be further damaged if the flooding worsens. One plant in the park, Single Point Parts, evacuated all workers from the premises and built flood prevention embankments around its building. ""The Thai finance ministry says overall damage from the floods could be more than $2 billion, with the worst yet still possibly to come,"" Hancocks says. Meanwhile, the UNESCO-listed Ayutthaya historical park, where the ruins of the old city of Ayutthaya are located, has been submerged since last week, according to local authorities. iReporter shares photos of Ayutthaya flooding . ""This is the worst flood in our historical site in 16 years,"" said Somsuda Leeyawanich, from the Thai Fine Arts Department. She said the water level in the park is almost three meters, compared to levels of around 80-90 centimeters during the floods of 1995. ""We are very concerned that if the site is under water for more than 30 days it may cause serious damage,"" she added. ""The temples are over 400 years old."" CNN's Paula Hancocks and Kocha Olarn contributed to this report .","Devastating Thai floods have killed 281 people; two people are missing .

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, Sharon Rocha was expecting her pregnant daughter, Laci Peterson, at dinner on Christmas Eve. Instead, she received a call that Laci was missing. Teams of police and community members scoured the woods and fields near Modesto, California, that night, again on Christmas Day, and for weeks afterward, but there was no sign of her. Four months later, her body washed ashore 90 miles away in the San Francisco Bay. She was 27. But it is Christmas, not springtime, that stirs a deep sadness in Laci Peterson's mother. Every Christmas season brings a reminder that Laci's life and her unborn son's were taken during what should have been a time of joy and anticipation. ""It's still hard to believe it happened, and that it's been 10 years,"" Rocha said Thursday over the phone, speaking slowly, her voice cracking. As the bright lights go up in the neighborhood, and Christmas carols fill the air, she says, ""My mind wanders back."" The words do not flow easily. Even now, Rocha finds it difficult to speak of her heartbreak without being overcome by tears. The parents of the 6- and 7-year-olds slain at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, are just embarking on the painful journey that Rocha has been on for a decade. If anyone knows the pain of celebrating the holidays when they are indelibly connected to tragedy, it is Sharon Rocha. Does she have any advice for the parents of Newtown? Not really. You just go on. You have no other choice. With a decade's worth of hindsight, Rocha sees a pattern in her sadness. The holidays are particularly hard every year. ""It will probably be like this forever,"" she sighs. This year was one of the hard ones, perhaps the hardest. Her unease began months earlier. Her son Brent and his family also live in California, and Rocha has four grandchildren. They help fill the void left by the deaths of Laci and her unborn child, a boy who would have been born that February and named Conner. One of her grandsons is close to the age Conner would be. The grandkids help Rocha enjoy the holidays, ""to an extent,"" she says. ""If it weren't for the grandkids, though, I wouldn't have a Christmas."" She thinks often of the grandson she never knew, wondering what Conner would have looked like, what his personality would have been like. Laci's half-sister Amy (they shared a father) is a hairstylist and still cuts Rocha's hair. Rocha may not be related to Amy by blood, but she feels closer to Laci when she's with Amy, and has gotten to know her better over the years. Amy is expecting her first child, a son, in February. Is it an eerie coincidence, or perhaps just sisters in sync? For years, Rocha would burst into tears when she used her blow dryer. Now she knows why: Amy was teaching Laci how to style her long, straight, glossy hair with a curling iron right before Laci vanished. The weeks after Laci disappeared were a blur as Rocha waited to hear from her daughter or find out what had happened to her. Rocha and others slowly grew suspicious of Laci's husband, Scott Peterson. They came to believe from his odd behavior that he not only knew what happened to her, he killed her himself. By the time his wife's body washed up, Scott seemed poised to flee the country. He was arrested in San Diego County. He had dyed his hair. Prosecutors posited this theory at his trial: Peterson, who was having an extramarital affair with a massage therapist, smothered or strangled Laci in the bedroom of their Modesto home on December 23 or 24, 2002. He then dumped her body in the San Francisco Bay during a Christmas Eve fishing trip. But there was little forensic evidence, and Peterson maintains his innocence to this day. The former fertilizer salesman, who was married to Laci for five years, was convicted of murdering Laci and Conner. He was sentenced to death, which appears to be years away. Hundreds of people gathered outside the courthouse and cheered the jury's decision. Rocha doesn't follow the news about Peterson. But she knew something happened in his case last summer because of all the voice mail messages she received. Peterson's attorneys had just filed his appeal and the media wanted her reaction. She read no further than the first page of the court filing, which asks for a new trial. Rocha sold the home she lived in when Laci disappeared, but she still lives in Modesto. Laci and Scott's house on Modesto's Covena Avenue is for sale again, listed at less than half the 2005 purchase price of $390,000. Beth Karas is a correspondent for In Session, which is produced by HLN and airs on sister network TruTV. She covered the Scott Peterson trial.","Laci Peterson went missing 10 years ago .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Three suspects arrested in Thailand on alleged terror ties have confessed to making counterfeit passports and other documents, the Thai news agency reported Thursday. The two Pakistani men and a Thai woman were part of a transnational crime syndicate that included Spain, the news agency said. Authorities said the three allegedly set up a base in Thailand, which they used to forge passports, the news agency said. Their partners in Spain stole tourist passports and shipped them to Thailand, where they were forged, according to the news agency. In addition to the three, seven other alleged Islamist extremists were arrested in Spain on Wednesday, the Spanish national police said. Six suspects were from Pakistan and one from Nigeria, police said. Investigators said the three arrested in Thailand are accused of directing the operation in Spain. They allegedly provided stolen travel documents to terrorist groups, the national police said. Police say the suspects are linked to terror groups. Their fake passports were also used in other crimes, including human trafficking, arms trade and illegal immigration, authorities told the news agency. According to police, the cell was dedicated to stealing travel documents, mostly passports, and sending them to Thailand, where they would be falsified and turned over to groups with links to al Qaeda, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant group based in Pakistan. The documents also ended up in the hands of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel force in Sri Lanka, police said. Since the March 11, 2004, commuter train bombings in Madrid that killed 190 and wounded 1,800, Spanish police and international police forces have kept a close eye on suspected Islamic radicals living in or transiting through the country. There have been numerous previous arrests for alleged support work, like these arrests, involving forged documents.","Two Pakistani men and a Thai woman are arrested in Thailand .

"(CNN) -- The shocking scenes that unfolded at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday have added another name to the list of respectable but otherwise unremarkable towns forever scarred by tragedy. Communities like Aurora, Columbine and Newtown have found themselves on the front line of a deeply emotional debate about the right to bear arms -- something that is enshrined in America's constitution. While some view the death of 20 children as proof that radical gun control reform in the U.S. is needed, others believe the solution to the problem of gun violence is not better regulations but more guns. The result is America often struggles to find a common voice that satisfies those who totally oppose guns and those who fundamentally believe in their right of self-defense. Yet gun violence is not an exclusively American issue. From Scotland to Tasmania, communities not too dissimilar to Newtown have experienced the same unspeakable horrors. But in some cases, those massacres have been a catalyst for important changes in gun control laws. We look at some of those experiences and their effects. Britain . Despite relatively limited gun ownership and availability, Britain has experienced several mass shootings in the past 25 years. On August 19, 1987, 27-year-old Michael Ryan went on a bloody rampage for several hours in the southern English town of Hungerford, Berkshire armed with a pistol, hand grenade and an automatic rifle. He murdered 16 people and wounded over a dozen others, before he shot himself after being tracked down in a college building in the town. In the wake of the Hungerford massacre, Britain introduced new legislation -- Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 -- making registration mandatory for owning shotguns and banning semi-automatic and pump-action weapons. Nine years later, on March 13, 1996, 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton burst into a school in the picturesque town of Dunblane in central Scotland and embarked on a terrifying shooting spree that left 16 five and six-year-old children and their teacher dead. The former scoutmaster turned one of the four pistols he was carrying on himself. The following year, a new law -- Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997 -- was passed effectively banning the private ownership of all handguns in the UK. This followed a highly successful public campaign in the months after Dunblane that included a petition being handed to the government with almost 750,000 signatures, according to British media reports. Britain was shaken by another massacre in June 2010 when a lone gunman, named as Derrick Byrd, killed 12 people and injured almost 30 others after a near four-hour shooting spree in rural Cumbria, northern England. After a huge manhunt, the body of the 52-year-old taxi driver was found alongside two powerful rifles, one equipped with a telescopic sight. He had taken his own life. Police were investigating 30 crime scenes at one point. The tragedy again raised questions about the effectiveness of Britain's gun laws after it was revealed Byrd was licensed to carry firearms. The licensing application process involves being vetted by police as well as the applicant's doctor to assess their fitness to own a weapon. Finland . Finland enjoys a strong tradition of hunting and has a high proportion of gun ownership, with 1.5 million firearms owned in a nation of more than five million people, according to government figures. Gun control has also been more relaxed here. Until recently anyone aged 15 and over was able to apply for a gun license if they offered a valid reason such as membership of a gun club. Though gun crime is rare, the country has suffered two major incidents at schools in recent years. On November 7, 2007, a teenager opened fire with a handgun at his high school in the southern Finnish town of Tuusula, killing eight people before fatally turning the gun on himself. Police said all of 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen's victims had multiple gunshot wounds, most to the upper body and head. Some 69 shells and more than 320 unused bullets were found at the scene. Auvinen, who had no criminal record, obtained a license for the weapon the previous month and regularly practiced sharp-shooting as a hobby at a local range, police said. The authorities said Auvinen, who police later described as lonely and antisocial, had posted a series of videos on YouTube featuring guns, with some hinting at the massacre at Jokela High School itself. The following year, on September 23, the country was numbed by news of another mass shooting. Over the course of 90 minutes, 10 people were fatally shot as Matti Juhani Saari, wearing a ski mask and black fatigues, rampaged through a campus at Kauhajoki city's School of Hospitality in southwestern Finland. The 22-year-old later died in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Chillingly, police revealed Saari had been questioned days before the shooting about a video posted on the internet showing him firing a gun, though no action was taken because he was licensed and had not broken the law. In the wake of the shootings, the Finnish government moved to issue new guidelines on the use of firearms, particularly handguns and revolvers. New applicants for handgun licenses are now required to show they've been active members of a gun club for one year and be vetted by their doctor and police. The minimum age for purchasing licenses of short barrel weapons has been raised to 20 -- 18 for hunting rifles. Permits are now valid for a period of five years before being reviewed. Australia . In one of his first acts as leader, Prime Minister John Howard announced major reforms to Australia's gun control laws just 12 days after 35 people died at the hands of a lone gunman wielding a military-style semi-automatic rifle at a popular tourist spot in Tasmania on April 28, 1996. In the wave of public revulsion against what became known as the Port Arthur massacre, the move for stricter gun controls was led by Howard, who had taken office just seven weeks earlier and who, in the first few hours after the tragedy, declared himself horrified ""at this shocking and senseless act."" He took his anti-gun campaign around the country, at one stage addressing a hostile pro-gun rally wearing a bullet-proof vest. He also oversaw a successful gun ""buy-back"" scheme that took some 650,000 guns out of circulation. Australia's eight states and territories got behind legislation that addressed mass shootings: High calibre rifles and shotguns were banned, licensing was tightened and remaining firearms were registered to uniform national standards -- an accomplishment regarded by many in the country as Howard's enduring legacy. Australia has been compared to the United States for its ""frontier mentality."" But unlike the U.S., there is no constitutional right to bear arms, gun ownership is markedly lower and American-style gun culture has taken hold in only a few pockets of Australian society -- most notably among the crime gangs operating in the two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne. Norway . July 22, 2011 will live long in the memory of all Norwegians after the carnage that unfolded that day. After detonating a bomb outside the prime minister's office in Oslo, killing eight people, Anders Behring Breivik took a ferry to Utoya Island and embarked on a shooting spree that took the lives of another 69 people attending a youth camp. Authorities said Breivik roamed the island shooting at campers, before members of an elite Norwegian police unit took him into custody. In August this year, Breivik, who boasted of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway, was judged to be sane at the time and sentenced to 21 years in prison after being charged with voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror. An independent report into the worst atrocity on Norwegian soil since World War II blamed a series of intelligence and planning failures for delaying the police arrival on the island by 30 minutes. Despite ownership and the type of ammunition permitted for use being tightly regulated, the report also criticized Norway's gun controls as ""inadequate."" It called for a total ban on semi-automatic weapons of the type Breivik purchased with relative ease. Like Finland, Norway has a high number of guns in circulation with hunting a national pastime. According to the Small Arms Survey 2007: Guns and the City,"" there are almost 32 firearms per 100 people in Norway. This compares to 88.82 per 100 in the United States. CNN's Richard Allen Greene and journalist Geoff Hiscock contributed to this report.","Communities like Aurora, Columbine, Newtown on front line of gun control debate .

"Washington (CNN) -- Proposed universal background checks of firearms purchases won't stop gun violence, but would serve agendas of people ""bent on destroying the Second Amendment,"" a top National Rifle Association official told a conservative political conference on Friday. Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the influential NRA, received repeated cheers and prolonged applause at the Conservative Political Action Conference when he took on proposals to toughen gun laws in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre that killed 20 first graders last December. According to LaPierre, an arrogant political and media elite wants to subvert the bedrock right to freedom that he said made America better than other countries. Possible 2016 candidates make CPAC pilgrimage . He repeatedly questioned the logic and even the sanity of President Barack Obama's administration and other advocates of new gun laws, and he implored supporters to ""stand up and fight"" now and in future elections to protect their right to own guns. ""No matter what the elitists who scorn you say, let them be damned,"" LaPierre declared. In particular, LaPierre took aim at Vice President Joe Biden for saying recently that a 12-gauge shotgun would provide better protection for women under threat at home than a high-powered semi-automatic rifle targeted by a proposed ban. ""The vice president of the United States actually told women facing an attack to just empty their shotguns into the air,"" LaPierre said. ""Honestly, have they lost their minds over at the White House?"" With the crowd cheering, he added: ""Keep your advice, we'll keep our guns."" The Senate Judiciary Committee this week sent four proposals to the full Senate for consideration, including an updated ban on semi-automatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons. Other measures would expand federal gun laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases and broaden background checks to include private firearms sales. Major conservative conference comes at crucial time for GOP . A fourth proposal that would establish a framework for the Department of Education to set safety guidelines aimed at protecting schools from gun violence was the only one to get significant bipartisan support from the committee. LaPierre insisted Friday that expanded background checks were a first step toward a liberal desire to create a national gun registry. ""In the end, there are only two reasons for government to create that federal registry of gun owners -- to tax them or to take them,"" he said. Supporters of expanded checks deny the legislation would create such a registry. Will states go where Congress hasn't on gun laws? LaPierre repeated the NRA's call for armed guards in every U.S. school and expressed bemused frustration with those who ridiculed his position. Noting a Department of Homeland Security video that advised people threatened by an armed attacker to fight back with any weapon handy, such as a pair of scissors, LaPierre responded with scorn. ""Let's get this straight,"" he said to applause. ""To protect our children at school, we recommend a trained professional with a gun and they recommend scissors? And they say we're crazy? It's sheer madness."" Study links gun laws and lower gun mortality .","The NRA's Wayne LaPierre delivers pro-gun red meat to political conservatives .

"(CNN) -- A Catholic hospital in hot water for claiming in a Colorado court that a fetus is not a person backtracked on Monday, saying it was ""morally wrong"" to make the argument while defending itself in a wrongful death lawsuit. The flip-flop concerns the case of Lori Stodghill. She was 28 weeks pregnant with twins when she went to the emergency room of St. Thomas More Hospital in Canon City, Colorado, vomiting and short of breath. She went into cardiac arrest in the lobby and died. That was New Year's Day 2006. Her husband, Jeremy Stodghill, sued the hospital and its owner, Catholic Health Initiatives, for the wrongful deaths of his wife and their unborn sons. Given the Catholic Church's belief that life begins at conception, defense attorneys for the hospital and doctors then entered an unusual argument. Proposal would give way out of birth-control coverage . They said that under state law, an embryo is not person until it is born alive. The claim attracted widespread attention and criticism, which apparently forced the about-face. ""In the discussion with the Church leaders, CHI representatives acknowledged that it was morally wrong for attorneys representing St. Thomas More Hospital to cite the state's Wrongful Death Act in defense of this lawsuit. That law does not consider fetuses to be persons, which directly contradicts the moral teachings of the Church,"" Catholic Health Initiatives said in a statement. It promised that attorneys for the hospital would not cite the Wrongful Death Act in any future hearings. Stodghill has petitioned the Colorado Supreme Court to hear his case. The state's bishops similarly released a statement, expressing support for CHI and for the Stodghill family. ""We join CHI in affirming the fundamental truth that human life, human dignity and human rights begin at conception. No law can ever mitigate God-given human rights,"" they said. ""Each human life is a sacred gift, created as a unique and unrepeatable expression of God's love. Life is given by God, and the right to life is a fundamental good, without which no other rights can be enjoyed."" Before and after Roe v. Wade .

"(LonelyPlanet.com) -- Puerto Rico is the fodder of many a Caribbean daydream for good reason: this natural jewel box can satisfy the lethargic beach bum, the sunrise rainforest explorer and the budding big-wave surfer -- all in a long weekend. Its coral reefs host a riot of tropical fish, its limestone caves in the misty central hills resound with the chirp of coquí frogs, and its unique collection of forests -- some of the wettest and driest in the Caribbean -- harbor some of the rarest birds in the world. Start your Puerto Rico daydreaming with our picks for the top 10 experiences for the traveler across the 'Island of Enchantment': . 1. Mysterious Old San Juan . Even those limited to a quick visit find it easy to fall under the beguiling spells of Old San Juan's cobblestone streets, pastel-painted colonial buildings and grand fortresses. From the ramparts of El Morro, the allure of this place is evident in every direction -- from the labyrinth of crooked streets to endless sparkle of the Atlantic. By day, lose yourself in historical stories of blood and bombast; by night, float along in crowds of giggling tourists, rowdy locals and syncopated salsa rhythms. Lonely Planet: Around the world in 5 signature drinks . 2. Beaches . This -- the rub of sand between the toes, the brilliant sparkle of turquoise water and rhythmic shush of cresting waves, maybe the patter of your favorite record in the headphones -- endows a visit to Puerto Rico with the qualities of daydream. From the golden, crescent-shaped heaven of Playa Flamenco (considered among the world's best beaches), coconut oil-scented crowds of Puerto Rico's little slice of Brazil, Playa Isla Verde, and the secluded, mangrove-shaded hideaways in the south to the roaring surf of the west, Puerto Rico's unending beaches are dreamy. 3. Bioluminescent bays . Few experiences can inspire the spine-tingling awe of floating into inky waves under a canopy of stars and becoming a witness to one of nature's most tactile magic tricks: the otherworldly sparkle of bioluminescent waters. Swimming or kayaking into Puerto Rico's bioluminescent bays and seeing the jeweled flicker of water drip from your hands or illuminate a paddle stroke promises an experience of profound wonder. The bioluminescent waters in the bays of Vieques reveal the phenomenon at its most fantastic. 4. Catch some béisbol . The bleachers at island béisbol (baseball) stadiums reveal a lot more than nine-innings of play -- it's a vantage on the fickle Caribbean love affair with baseball. Puerto Rico's zeal for the sport may never fill the oversized stadiums that dot the island, but the low-key games and dirt cheap tickets get béisbol fans right up in the action. Expect to witness a face off between upstart farm leaguers looking for their big shot and fading stars of the Major League Basketball looking to go out in a blaze of glory. 5. Rum cocktails at sunset . If there's an elixir to help those sunsets imprint your memory forever, it likely comes in a tall, cold glass. From the piña coladas with toy umbrellas to the everyman's Cuba libre (rum and Coke with a wedge of lime) you'd be remiss to leave 'King Sugar' without savoring a rum cocktail during a spectacular sunset. Find a comfortable perch in the west -- maybe Rincón's ultra-chill surfer hang, Tamboo Tavern, or the breezy, upscale comforts at Eclipse -- and sip a taste of paradise. Lonely Planet: Lonely Planet's voyages of a lifetime . 6. Swimming & snorkeling . Many of the island's most marvelous places for snorkeling and swimming lie out of the heavily traveled tourist corridors, on satellite islands off the main island's east or south coast and coral reefs in the southwest. In the morning, waters off these areas are crystal clear and usually calm enough to paddle around for hours enjoying visibility up to 75 feet. And what a view -- expect a riot of brightly colored fish, coral formations and, if you're lucky, a lazy ray. The consistency clear waters of Isla Desecheo, off the island's west coast, also top any divers' wish list. 7. Museums of Ponce . Ponce, the so-called 'Pearl of the South,' boasts a wealth of museums with enough diversity to satisfy the most intellectually rapacious museum hunter. Those interested in the distinctive rhythms of the island should start with Museo de la Música Puertorriqueña before touring the lovingly restored plantation at Hacienda Buena Vista or the best art museum in the Caribbean, the Museo de Arte de Ponce. 8. Cuisine in San Juan's SoFo District . When cruise ships shimmer like floating cities at the docks just off shore, the world-class restaurants of SoFo (short for 'South of Fortaleza,' naturally) rise to the occasion, impressing their international audiences with the most inventive plates of fine dining in the Caribbean. Recent years have seen a revolving door of hot restaurants in this corner of Old San Juan, but only the most creative survive. Expect the traditional, elemental essence of Puerto Rican flavors fused with preparations from across the globe. 9. Colonial architecture . If you tried to savor every single example of colonial grandeur -- all the fountains and historic squares, every dignified plantation house or buttressed 19th-century town hall -- Puerto Rico's architecture gems would demand a month-long stay. But, if nothing else outside of Old San Juan earns time on your agenda, take a stroll around the Plaza Las Delicias in Ponce, a place downright littered with statues, lined by colonial edifices, and crowned by the regal Fuente de los Leones (a rescued relic from the 1939 New York world's fair). 10. El Yunque tropical rainforest . The lush forests, verdant hills and crashing waterfalls of El Yunque are the only true rainforests in the US, a place to embark on a short hike through the oxygen-rich mist, explore waterfalls and gawk at Jurassic-sized ferns. You will get wet, so bring a raincoat, but bring binoculars too; of the 26 species found here and nowhere else in the world, you'll want to keep a sharp eye out for the Puerto Rican parrot, one of the 10 most endangered birds on earth.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Atlanta Falcons have ""relinquished their contractual rights"" to Michael Vick, one of the highest-paid players in professional sports before his conviction on dogfighting charges, the Falcons manager said Friday. Michael Vick will be confined to this Hampton, Virginia, house for the rest of his sentence. In a statement posted on the football team's Web site, General Manager Thomas Dimitroff said, ""Michael remains suspended by the NFL [National Football League]. However, in the event NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell decides to reinstate Michael, we feel his best opportunity to re-engage his football career would be at another club. ""Our entire organization sincerely hopes that Michael will continue to focus his efforts on making positive changes in his life, and we wish him well in that regard,"" Dimitroff said. The quarterback was drafted by the Falcons in 2001, and played six seasons with the team. Vick, who will turn 29 on June 26, pleaded guilty in August 2007 to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. He was freed from the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, on May 20, and returned to his home in Hampton, Virginia, the following day. He will serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement, his publicist, Judy Smith, said after his release. Vick could have returned to professional football as soon as September if reinstated by the NFL, said the sports agent who negotiated Vick's 10-year, $140 million contract with the Falcons. Now, however, he has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. A federal bankruptcy judge recently denied a plan presented by Vick and urged him to offer another plan to handle his debts. The original plan called for Vick to come up with $750,000 to $1 million in cash to be paid to creditors, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro said, but he said he saw no evidence Vick could come up with that much. Santoro suggested Vick's next plan not call for him to keep two houses and three cars, as did the rejected proposal. Vick, who acknowledged failing to handle his money well, told the judge he was earning 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor in prison. He has offered to work with the Humane Society of the United States on anti-dogfighting campaigns, Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle has told CNN. He was to work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting, and on programs to assist young people who have already been involved in the blood sport. In testimony before the bankruptcy judge, Vick acknowledged committing a ""heinous"" act and said he should have acted more maturely.","Manager: Team has relinquished contractual rights to suspended pro football player .

"(CNN) -- One year ago, the enemy that had haunted America for nearly a decade met his end in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Osama bin Laden is no longer a threat to the United States because of President Obama's leadership and strong national security policies. Good intelligence practices and surgical counterterrorism operations enabled us to kill 20 of al Qaeda's top 30 leaders, including bin Laden. This is an accomplishment by any measure. We have diminished al Qaeda's strength, so for the sake of our economic and national security, we should decrease our military presence and bring our troops home from Afghanistan as soon as is safely possible. The American people agree. According to the latest New York Times/CBS poll, more than two-thirds of Americans think that the United States should no longer be at war in Afghanistan. The president's plan started by withdrawing 10,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan between June and December 2011. The 33,000 ""surge"" troops assigned in 2009 are scheduled to leave Afghanistan by this summer. We will continue the troop drawdown until 2014 when, if all goes according to plan, a strengthened Afghan force and NATO troops will maintain peace. But with our core mission of decimating al Qaeda in Afghanistan accomplished, is the continuing military presence until 2014 worth the cost? More than 1,900 Americans have died in Afghanistan, and more than 15,000 have been wounded. Attacks with improvised explosive devices increased last year and have caused a surge in double amputees. A recent study found that one in four Afghanistan and Iraq veterans were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder between 2004 and 2009. Unlike the United States' adversaries of the 20th century, al Qaeda is a mobile force that is not confined by borders. According to CIA reports, in 2010 there were fewer than 100 al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan. Clearly this small number does not warrant our large-scale troop presence there, which peaked at 100,000 last year. The justification that we should stay in Afghanistan to prevent al Qaeda's return is unconvincing. Al Qaeda operates in lawless states, such as Yemen and Somalia, with relative ease. But it makes no sense to put tens of thousands of boots on the ground in those countries. Since our enemy is not limited by borders, why do we continue to put the lives of our brave troops at risk and spend billions of taxpayer dollars to secure one country? Communities nationwide feel the financial effects of keeping our troops in Afghanistan. Republicans are demanding drastic domestic spending cuts that are hurting people here at home. At the same time, the proposed budget for the war in Afghanistan for 2013 is $88 billion. The annual cost to support one U.S. soldier in Afghanistan is more than $1 million, according to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. That figure would employ about 35 Americans here at home through federal infrastructure spending. Instead of spending billions on a war that is not making us safer, we could better advance U.S. national security by providing greater support to people in Middle Eastern countries fighting for freedom and democracy. Supporting their democratic aspirations and protecting their human rights, not just with words but also through bold actions, is the surest way to turn back anti-Americanism and terrorism in the region. Congress should support President Obama in making these changes. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Keith Ellison.","Keith Ellison: Two-thirds of Americans think it's time to take U.S. troops out of Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- It started out life as a new video game concept but quickly morphed into a prototype with a far more practical vision -- a haptic device to help the blind and visually impaired. Tacit is a wrist-mounted device which informs the wearer about the proximity of objects in complex environments, according to its creator Steve Hoefer. Ultrasonic sensors positioned at the front measure distances from one inch up to 10 feet (2cm to 3.5m), Hoefer says, while motorized rubber pads at the rear apply increasing amounts of pressure on the wrist as users get closer to an object. The original idea was rather different. Hoefer wanted to create a ""dungeon crawl"" game (a type of fantasy role-playing adventure set in labyrinths) that didn't rely on vision. So he built a haptic headband complete with sensors and vibration motors. It worked, but there was a problem. He kept crashing into things that weren't at head height and the vibrations drove him batty, he says. Moving the remodeled device to the back of his hand not only saved him a lot of stubbed toes, but also steered the project in its new direction. The prototype is powered by a standard nine volt battery and can be worn on either hand. It's cheap too, with materials totaling around $75, Hoefer says. So far, tests with the blind have been very positive, he says, and it's attracting interest from educators, designers and researchers in the field. Robin Spinks, principle manager of digital accessibility at the UK's Royal National Institute of Blind People thinks the device shows promise. ""Orientation and mobility are critical skills for a blind person's independence, education, employment and quality of life. Electronic orientation devices, such as Tacit have the potential to enable individuals to move around independently and gain confidence,"" Spinks said. San Francisco-based Hoefer is currently working on reducing Tacit's size as well as improving its accuracy and simplifying its construction. ""It's not perfect, but it works, and it can be better,"" Hoefer said. ""It could easily be made about half the size, and the replaceable batteries should be replaced by rechargeables with a blind-friendly charging method -- either a wireless or magnetically-aligning power plug."" ""One of the biggest and best criticisms is that it is very difficult for a blind person to build their own. I hope to address that in a future version,"" he said. Hoefer has released details of Tacit's materials, circuits and software on his Grathio Labs web site under a Creative Commons license to maximise feedback and hopefully improve the design. ""There are a number of improvements and changes left to be made. I'm curious to see what happens,"" he said.","San Francisco-based inventor devises cheap haptic device to help visually impaired .

"Near the Demilitarized Zone, South Korea (CNN) -- Kim Jin Young peered through powerful binoculars across the last frontier of the Cold War. He traveled from Seoul by bus, along with dozens of other curious day-trippers, many with their young children, to visit the Odu Mountain public observatory here, which overlooks a heavily-guarded stretch of the border with North Korea. This is the closest many South Koreans ever get to their increasingly hostile, northern neighbor. ""North Korea's military capability is pretty big, and South Korea's military is preparing for it,"" Kim says, counting the numerous military outposts positioned along the river banks below. ""But I am quite concerned because security awareness of the South Korean public is not great, and we need to strengthen it."" He has good reason to worry. Just days before, the regime in Pyongyang, hit by a fresh round of U.N. sanctions over it recent satellite launch, issued a direct threat to the South. Read more: How close is North Korea to a nuclear missile? In an angry statement, North Korean officials pledged to conduct a third nuclear test, vowing that if South Korea supports the sanctions it would use ""strong physical countermeasures"" against ""the group of puppet traitors"" in Seoul, a phrase often used by Pyongyang when it talks about the South Korean government. It's unclear what the isolated state may have in mind. The South Korean president's office released a statement Thursday urging North Korea to ""immediately stop with its provocative language and movement and abide by its international obligations."" It warned that ""if North Korea is to make misjudgments and carry out with additional provocations,"" that a ""severe outcome"" would result. U.S.: North Korean nuclear test 'soon' President Lee Myung-bak ordered the South Korean defense minister to prepare a strong response if North Korea follows through with a nuclear test. In the past, the North has shelled territory in the south. It's also accused of sinking a South Korean warship in 2010, killing more than 40 sailors. ""Whenever North Korea makes such comments, we need to be very concerned,"" said Kim Jong Soon, another visitor to the Odusan Unification Observatory.

That's why South Koreans should be very concerned now,"" he added. South Korean Launch . After North Korea's successful December satellite launch, Pyongyang's state television broadcast continuous scenes of orchestrated jubilation. Thousand of North Koreans were shown thronging the streets in celebration, as their rivals in the South smarted at being beaten in the race to launch a satellite. How could a regime as impoverished as that in Pyongyang better the high-tech South, many South Koreans asked. Op-ed: Rescind North Korea's license to provoke . But the technological coup was quickly answered in Seoul. South Korea finally lifted its own satellite into orbit Wednesday, after two previous failed attempts. Spectators watched, nervously, as the Naro rocket, built with Russian help, blasted into orbit. Officials confirmed its small satellite was successfully deployed in space. South Korea's past experience with rockets has been patchy. Its first launch in 2009 reached orbit, then failed to detach. The second, a year later, exploded just two minutes into its flight. North Korea has not reacted to South Korea's success. But this region appears to be amid a tense and accelerating space race. In recent days, Japan has launched spy satellites to monitor the region. China and the U.S. say they've tested missile interceptors. And now South Korea has joined Pyongyang in that elite space club. Read more: Is Asia on cusp of space race?

"(Fast Company)  -- For years, employees at Google have suggested a project near and dear to their nerd hearts: a Google-led science fair. ""It's come up over and over and over again,"" says Cristin Frodella, a senior product marketing manager in education at Google. After all, many a Googler has fond childhood memories of explaining the genius of his or her biology experiment to passersby in a school gym. (Frodella and her best friend trained hamsters to ask for food by ringing a bell.) Today those Googlers and budding scientists worldwide should be ecstatic. The company launched Google Science Fair, the first global online science competition. It's open to full-time students ages 13 to 18, who are encouraged to use the panoply of Google products to record and share their work. ""We want to let kids use our online tools so they can participate from anywhere in world,"" Frodella tells Fast Company. ""They may be home schooled or live in a remote place or not have a physical science fair in their area."" They do, however, need an Internet connection. This is a far cry from your typical local science fair. Google's competition kicked off this morning at its New York offices with some showy science courtesy of Syyn Labs, the company behind the Rube Goldberg machine for last year's OK Go viral hit ""This Too Shall Pass."" Syyn's machine for Google fired a laser, activating a rover that lifted a red curtain draped over the fair's logo. Then Google brought a riveting cast of scientists on stage to inspire the 100 or so local students in attendance. Google's partners include National Geographic, CERN, Scientific American, and Lego. Consequently, the judges are not your eighth-grade biology teacher and the football coach who took a freshman chemistry course. They include Vint Cerf, its chief Internet evangelist and one of the fathers of the Web, and National Geographic's explorer-in-residence, the geneticist Spencer Wells. Cerf gave a brief history of the Internet, telling students that breakthroughs of that magnitude don't ""just happen."" They require scientists asking questions, forming hypothesis, failing, and then asking more questions. If it seems to students as if all the good stuff has already been discovered, Cerf said, remember that ""95% of the universe is unknown to us. It's all Tabula rasa."" Fast Company: Google drops H.264 . William Kamkwamba, a self-taught scientist from Malawi, Africa, talked about the direct impact that science can have, not just on society at large, but on an individual community. From reading a library book, Kamkwamba, the son of a farmer and one of seven kids, learned how to build a wind mill, which powers his family's house and pumps water in an impoverished area. He taught his neighbors how to build wind mills, too, which have transformed schools and improved conditions in the village. If his poignant story wasn't enough to spur the young scientists in the room and those watching the live stream of the event online, then that of Tesca Fitzgerald, a 15-year-old dynamo from Portland, Oregon, most likely did. She began programming computers at age 5, enrolled in community college at 12, and last year was recognized for her skills by the National Center for Women and Information Technology. One of Fitzgerald's experiments, using artificial intelligence to route robots and assist nurses in a local V.A. hospital, serves as the model project on the Google Science Fair site. Fast Company: More technology coverage . The goal of the Google Science Fair isn't just to give great prizes, including a trip to the Galapagos Islands and $110,000 in scholarships. It's to foster more interest in science worldwide and to come up with much-needed solutions to local and global problems -- if not now, then eventually. ""We want kids to make a difference in the world,"" says Frodella. ""They can be agents of change."" The deadline for submissions is April 4. In July, 15 finalists will attend the awards ceremony at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. Visit Google Science Fair to learn more.

"(CNN) -- Video games are no longer viewed as the preserve of teenage timewasters but as useful tools for businesses to prepare employees headed overseas. ""Serious games"", as they're generally referred to (distinguishing them from those played for entertainment), often employ simulations of real-life scenarios, giving business travelers the chance to navigate a foreign climate prior to takeoff. Read also: High-tech hotels a hit with geeky guests . ""The biggest failure of traditional (training) techniques is that they are not engaging enough for learners to stick with,"" notes Mike Emonts, the senior business development specialist at Alelo, a software company that specializes in Virtual Cultural-Awareness Trainers. Alelo's products were originally created to train military and government personnel to operate abroad. Using realistic scenarios, users can learn to how to manage a crowd in Iraqi Arabic, or direct rebuilding measures in Pashto. The company is currently working to adapt their model to fit with enterprises dong business internationally. ""We believe the effectiveness of our solution would apply to the travel market,"" says Emonts. ""The bottom line is that travelers are not looking to simply learn a language. They want to order at restaurants, and ask people directions. They have specific tasks they want to be able to accomplish. Our training solutions are specifically developed for this purpose."" Though pervasive in many industries, serious games have only started gaining momentum in the business travel sector. Louis Bernard, who has recently developed ""Mr Travel"" believes his is the only travel security game on the market. ""I've done my homework, and there's nothing else out there that does what we do,"" he says. Mr Travel, which made its UK debut at the Business Travel Show last week, mimics the sort of scrapes a road warrior might face in a foreign climate. Though the world it portrays is fictional (users ""time travel"" through cartoon landscapes like the Wild West, and ancient Persia), the dilemmas are all real. Users are taught how to safely store their passport, avoid questionable food, and even endure a kidnapping. Companies sending employees overseas are required by law to provide them with travel security training. Bernard, whose background is in crisis management and risk development, has himself administered many of these educational sessions. ""Travel security presentations can be boring,"" he admits. ""That's why I developed Mr Travel; I wanted to come up with a way to engage employees, and ensure they actually retain the appropriate information."" Read also: Digital detox: Gadget junkies go cold turkey . In addition to being an arguably more effective education model, Mr Travel is also a lot cheaper than traditional training. Still, given the potential spending power of business travelers (and the companies that employ them), there is still a relative gap in the market for serious games that address their needs. Ian Bogost, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a founding partner of Persuasive Games, theorizes that a shaky global economy has forced some companies to take a pause from investing in serious games. He also finds that corporations make reluctant trailblazers. ""The idea of using a medium like games, or anything else that's new and slightly unproven, or unfamiliar, always puts it at a disadvantage."" Bogost developed Jetset, a tongue-and-cheek game about airport security aimed at business travelers, back in 2007, but found there wasn't much market for it at the time. ""If you travel a lot, and watch what folks are doing on airplanes, you'll find them playing Solitaire or Bejeweled on their iPhones. They're games that don't have anything to do with the travel experience, because really, when you're traveling, you just want it all to go away; you don't want to think about the fact that you're on a plane."" Still, Bogost recognizes that there is tremendous opportunity for more advanced games in the travel industry. ""Business travel seems like a great audience for this type of media,"" he notes. ""They always have (personal electronic devices) on their person, they're stuck in one place for long periods of time, and stuck in one place where they have internet access. On the surface, it makes sense.""","Businesses are increasingly using games to train employees heading overseas .

"(CNN) -- Snowflakes are piling up at many major U.S. ski areas, and many of you are anxiously pulling your gear out of storage in preparation to hit the slopes. In anticipation of the march to the mountains, we thought you might like to know what's new at select lodgings in some of America's favorite ski destinations. It's obvious they're going all out to make your trip to the slopes one to remember. We start our journey in California with a brand new property, the Basecamp South Lake Tahoe (from $89/night), a friendly 50-room retreat that opened earlier this year in the heart of the Lake Tahoe Basin. A haven for outdoor enthusiasts throughout the year, not just ski season, it's less than a five-minute stroll from the lake and the Heavenly Gondola. While Basecamp's design could be called whimsical and woodsy, it includes creature comforts like 300-thread-count sheets, flat-screen TVs and in-room gear racks for all your stuff. Envisioned as a place for like-minded people to meet and share experiences, its public areas are the ones that really shine, though, from the communal dining table to the rooftop hot tub to the dual fire pits for roasting s'mores. Also new is the Washington School House Hotel (from $436/night), a stunning conversion in historic Park City, Utah. Technically, it was open for part of last year's ski season, but given its late arrival, the schoolhouse turned chic ski lodging didn't get the attention it deserves. In a limestone structure dating back to 1889, what were once classrooms -- and the principal's office -- have been transformed into inviting accommodations boasting hardwood floors, luxe fabrics and imported antiques. AprÃ¨s ski, sip cocktails in the cozy lounge or take a dip in the heated pool built into the aspen-covered hillside. Colorado's ski towns have updates galore to gab about. In Aspen alone, you've got renovations at two notable properties. When it reopens this week, the prestigious Hotel Jerome (from $388/night) will reveal a brand new look to everything from its lobby and atrium to its 93 guestrooms and suites. It will also unveil, for the first time in its 125-year history, its very own spa, a milestone that is no doubt music to the ears of guests who spend all day schussing down the mountainside. The recently reopened St. Regis Aspen (from $329/night), has been refashioned with a $43 million makeover to be more in keeping with the grand mountain manor style St. Regis founder John Jacob Astor envisioned for the brand oh so many years ago. Not only has the interior been totally upgraded, but the hotel also has recently introduced a new restaurant concept in partnership with Food & Wine magazine. Called Chefs Club, it features an open kitchen, a chef's table and a menu overseen by a group of culinary artists dubbed by Food & Wine as the country's ""Best New Chefs."" In nearby Snowmass, the former Silvertree Hotel & Conference Center has been overhauled and relaunched as the Westin Snowmass Resort (from $89/night), complete with all of Westin's signature programs and amenities, including those dreamy Heavenly Beds that are so comfy you almost don't want to get out from under the covers. But you will, knowing that the hotel offers ski-in/ski-out access, along with its own ski concierge. Follow the Rockies up north to Essex, Montana, near the entrance to Glacier National Park, and you'll find the quaint Izaak Walton Inn (from $89/night). We bring up this family-owned retreat not just for its proximity to a wealth of backcountry runs and trails, but also to appease those of you looking for something a little different in your snow-centered stay -- namely, a host of old rail cars that have been converted into unique sleeping quarters, including two new cabooses recently transplanted to the site. The refurbished Northern Pacific Bay Window Caboose, which sleeps six, and the Great Northern X215 Caboose, which sleeps four, both offer luxury accommodations boasting full kitchens, gas fireplaces and commanding views of the surrounding forest. This is also a spot for anyone who wants to get away from it all; with the exception of one rail car, there are no TVs here and you can't get cellphone service, although they do have pay phones and complimentary Wi-Fi access for guests in the Flagstop Bar. Ski aficionados on the East Coast are in for a treat now that the 234-room Mountain Club on Loon (from $136/night), located in New Hampshire's White Mountain region just two hours from Boston, has finally completed the $9 million upgrade it began in 2007. The ski-in/ski-out hotel and spa sports everything from new carpeting and temperature controls to updated wallpaper and kitchen appliances. General manager Bob Bielan brags that the redo has produced ""a fresh look to rival the grandeur of our setting.""","New hotels and lodging revamps are welcoming skiers this season .

"New York (CNN) -- A man arrested on suspicion of possession of an explosive substance allegedly told people he planned to blow up the iconic arch in New York City's Washington Square Park, authorities say. Aaron Greene, 31, was arrested in December after police say they discovered the explosive substance and a sawed-off shotgun in his Manhattan apartment while serving an unrelated warrant for felony grand larceny against his girlfriend, Morgan Gliedman. As part of the investigation, New York Police Department Intelligence Division detectives found witnesses who recounted alleged conversations that Greene had with them regarding the arch, Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne told CNN on Thursday. ""I'm making bombs,"" Greene allegedly told witnesses, according to Browne. ""What for?"" the witnesses asked, the deputy commissioner said. ""To blow up the arch,"" Greene allegedly replied, Browne said. Formally known as the Washington Square Arch, it was built in the early 1890s and is modeled after the famed Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It was formally dedicated at the park in 1895, and today it is considered one of Greenwich Village's iconic landmarks. Greene, according to Browne, tested a small amount of the explosives -- believed to be hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, or HMTD -- in the park to demonstrate the power of the explosives to the witnesses. During the test, Browne blew up a small amount of the chemical by hitting it with a rock, which caused it to ignite and cause a small explosion, Browne said. Police issued no public reports of an explosion at the park at the time witnesses said the incident allegedly occurred. A week ago, law enforcement sources speaking on condition of anonymity said Greene allegedly set off a small explosion in front of witnesses inside his apartment. That's what initially led witnesses to alert the NYPD that Greene possessed explosive chemicals, said the sources, who were not authorized to release details of the investigation to the media. After Greene was arrested, he was questioned by police about whether he had other weapons. He allegedly told police ""he had given them to a friend in law enforcement,"" Browne said. Police say Greene did not identify the so-called friend, but investigators identified him as Daniel Whittaker, 33, in Orangeberg, NY. Authorities say they discovered a cache of firearms in Whittaker's home. ""We found 21 guns, including an Uzi and assault weapon, a switchblade, brass knuckles and a stun gun,"" said Browne. Whittaker has not been charged by the NYPD, Browne said. Whittaker is a suspended corrections officer in Rockland County, NY, Browne said. Prosecutors say he is currently on trial in Rockland County on charges of drug possession and fleeing an officer. His attorney in that case, Joey Jackson, said that while Whittaker knows Greene, he had no knowledge of Greene's alleged criminal activities and was not guilty by association. Jackson is a CNN legal analyst. Investigators also say they discovered undated letters allegedly written by Greene at Whittaker's home. ""In one, Greene says his parents have sent him to Greece because they're concerned if he stayed in New York, he'd kill 100 people,"" Browne said. ""On another piece of paper, he also wrote the word 'kill' dozens of times and 'kill them all.'"" Greene also drew a symbol, according to Browne, that was the same one used by the Nazi Schutzstaffel, commonly known as the ""SS"". ""It looks like two lightning bolts,"" he said. Police say Greene was arrested on December 29 after they discovered a plastic container with seven grams of the explosive in the apartment he shared with 27-year-old Gliedman. In addition officers also found the sawed-off shotgun and multiple rounds of ammunition, police said. ""The biggest cause of concern is the explosive,"" Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told CNN. Police said they also discovered what they described as manuals about how to make explosive materials and bombs, including a collection of pages with a cover page titled ""The Terrorist Encyclopedia."" Greene and Gliedman were each charged with felony criminal possession of a weapon in the first degree and second degrees, the district attorney's office said, adding that when the charges against the pair may be amended. Gliedman, who was pregnant at the time of her arrest, also was charged with felony grand larceny involving credit card theft. Shortly after her arrest, Gliedman went into labor and gave birth to a daughter who she named Melody, Browne said. Gliedman was released Tuesday on $150,000 bond, according to the district attorney's office. Greene is being held without bond. The pair are scheduled to be arraigned in a Manhattan court on January 29. Greene's attorney, Lisa Pelosi, and Gliedman's attorney, Gerald Shargel, both declined a CNN request Thursday for comment. CNN's Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","Aaron Greene, 31, was arrested by police on December 29 .

"(CNN) -- When Serbia and Croatia take to the field at Zagreb's Maksimir Stadium on Friday, memories of a bloody, war-torn history between the neighboring countries will be brought sharply into focus. The 2014 World Cup qualifying tie will be the first time the two teams have played each other since the break up of the former Yugoslavia and then the Croatian War of Independence, which raged between 1991 and 1995. The break up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s caused the bloodiest conflict on the European continent since World War II, with an estimated 140,000 people killed. As the wounds of war continue to heal, Croatia coach Igor Stimac has urged fans not to use the game as an attempt to settle old scores. ""I implore the Croatian fans to back us with their love for the national team and not hatred for our opponents,"" Stimac, who picked up 53 caps for Croatia between 1990 and 2002, told reporters ahead of the match. ""All those who turn up should support us in the most dignified manner and if they do, they will put the much-needed wind in our sails to get the result we want in this historic match. ""This is a great chance to show everyone, including FIFA and UEFA, what we are really like. Both teams have the capacity to keep this event a football match and show the world that they are great football nations."" Cursed war . A Croatia victory on Friday would effectively end Serbia's World Cup qualification hopes. Croatia currently sit second in the group, level on 10 points with leaders Belgium, while Serbia are on four points and would be nine points behind Stimac's side should they lose the much-anticipated game. Like Stimac, Serbia coach Sinisa Mihajlovic wants his players to inspire passionate support from their fans. And like Stimac, Mihajlovic is keen to move away from the past. ""This game isn't a continuation of the war,"" the former Yugoslavia player told Italy's La Gazzetta dello Sport earlier this week. ""We've already witnessed the real, cursed and horrid war and we're still carrying the wounds and the scars. ""This is just a passionate, important football match that stirs up a lot of emotion in people: an important game for our position in the group table and for the continued development of my players. ""If we win, we'll cut the gap to three points and we're still in the running for qualification."" Both Mihajlovic and Stimac played when Croatia and Yugoslavia were drawn together in the qualifying tournament for Euro 2000. The first match in Belgrade in August 1999 was drawn 0-0, while the return fixture in Zagreb later the same year was crucial to both their hopes of reaching the championships in Holland and Belgium. ""The stadium in Zagreb was like a volcano,"" recalls Mihajlovic, who played in the match, while Stimac missed out. ""There were police everywhere. ""There were lots of former teammates who had played alongside each other for Yugoslavia now facing each other. Now no longer on the same side. ""There was a banner there 'Vukovar 1991', the city that was so symbolic of the war,"" added Mihajlovic, referring to the Croatian city that was heavily damaged during a siege in the conflict. Vukovar was the birthplace of Mihajlovic, who was the son of a Croatian mother and Serbian father. These days about one third of Vukovar's population is made up of Serbs, though the two ethnic groups remain segregated. ""All the Serbs will be watching at home; we've had bad experiences in the past when we've tried to watch Serbia games and Croats have come and thrown stones at the cafes we're in,"" Djordje Macut, president of the town's Council of Serbian Minorities, told the Independent newspaper. ""Every time I went up to take a free-kick or a corner, tension was high,"" continued Mihajlovic, as he recalled more memories from that Zagreb game in 1990. ""I hit the woodwork twice, once the post, another time the crossbar. ""And I also played a part in the goals from (Pedrag) Mijatovic and (Dejan) Stankovic: 2-2, we qualified, Croatia were knocked out."" Bloody history . Mihajlovic and his team is likely to encounter a similarly vociferous atmosphere at the Maksimir Stadium on Friday. No away supporters will attend either of the World Cup qualifying matches between the two teams. The Maksimir Stadium has its own bloody history. It was the scene of an infamous encounter between Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb and Serbian team Red Star Belgrade in 1990 which saw a riot break out and a number people stabbed and wounded. Friday's game will serve as a barometer for the mood of fans, with those who remember the conflict and those too young to have witnessed the fighting being brought together. ""I've been to Zagreb and Belgrade and both cities, both countries, view this as something much bigger than football,"" James Montague, author of When Friday Comes: Football, War and Revolution in the Middle East, told CNN. ""In the past the game has really been the canary in the mine in terms of the political dynamics on the ground. ""It is a little different now. The older generations, of course, remember the horrors and this is an extension of that in some respects. ""But younger people are different. Few of the players, especially in Serbia, have much experience of life before 1990. For them this is a game. ""It is the people around it that have long memories and remember what was a particularly vicious civil war. Every year the hatred gets a little less."" Both Stimac and Mihajlovic called for calm ahead of the contest and will be expected to set a dignified tone on Friday, but the two coaches did not always see eye-to-eye during their playing careers. ""Stimac and Mihajlovic have a long dislike of each other, stemming from the 1991 Yugoslav Cup Final between Hajduk Split and Red Star Belgrade,"" explained Montague. ""It took place just as war was breaking out. They both got sent off bad mouthing each other. They have both said ridiculously nationalistic things in the past. ""But the two have buried a 20-year feud by meeting and agreeing to lead by a positive example. It's up to everyone there on Friday night to follow suit.""","Croatia to play Serbia in 2014 World Cup qualifier on Friday .

"Budapest, Hungary (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people protested against Hungary's new constitution in Budapest Monday night, demanding that Prime Minister Viktor Orban resign. Crowds outside the city's opera house called the prime minister ""Viktator"" -- a pun on ""dictator"" -- as Orban and other dignitaries attended a gala inside. Lasting nearly five hours, the protest was organized by opposition parties and civil society groups who say the new constitution is anti-democratic. American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed similar concerns last year, pushing Orban to commit to ""the independence of the judiciary, a free press, and governmental transparency."" Orban and other officials left the gala celebrating the new constitution through back doors to avoid the demonstration. The new constitution, which took effect on January 1, omits ""republic"" from Hungary's official name, and includes several paragraphs which Amnesty International says violate international human rights. The human rights organization has been critical of sections that define life as beginning at conception and marriage as being between a man and a woman. It also expressed concerns about the possibility of life imprisonment without parole, and failure to forbid discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Monday's demonstration was preceded by a series of protests in 2011 against laws introduced by Hungary's populist government. Critics have said the new media law is restrictive and the new electoral law favors Orban's ruling party FIDESZ. They have also taken aim at a law criminalizing homelessness. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso wrote to Orban in December requesting the withdrawal of two recent bills related to the country's financial stability and the central bank. Orban rejected the requests.","Tens of thousands protest at the opera house, calling the prime minister a dictator .

"London (CNN) -- Icelandic volcano ash is affecting flights in European airspace, but authorities say it is unlikely to cause the same levels of disruption triggered by a similar eruption last year. So what are the main differences between the two volcanic ash clouds and to what extent will travel plans be hit? Who has been affected so far? Icelandic airspace was closed over the weekend. By early Tuesday, several hundreds flights from England, Scotland and Northern Ireland had been canceled with British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair, Aer Lingus, Loganair, Flybe and KLM among operators grounding jets. Meteorologist have warned prevailing winds are blowing the ash cloud towards London's Heathrow airport, potentially closing airspace above Europe's busiest air hub. Officials say there is a strong possibility some Scandinavian airports may also be affected. Send travel report to Twitter . Among those changing travel plans have been U.S. President Barack Obama, who flew into London a day ahead of schedule, and Barcelona's soccer team, which is traveling to the UK capital early ahead of Saturday's Champion's League final clash against Manchester United. How will the disruption differ from last year's? Ash from the eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano in April 2010 prompted the closure of airspace across Europe, stranding millions of passengers and costing the airline industry more than $2 billion. Authorities say there is uncertainty over how long the latest ash cloud, generated by Grimsvotn -- Iceland's most active volcano -- is likely to last, and how it will be affected by atmospheric changes. However, weather patterns indicate most mainland European airports will not be hit and airspace will remain open. Changes in flight safety regulations also mean fewer flights will be affected. What are the safety regulation changes? Most significantly, aviation authorities have raised the threshold on what density of ash cloud is considered safe to fly through. Last year, 200 micrograms of ash per cubic meter was seen as the maximum, this year it has been raised to 4,000 micrograms per cubic meter. Ash density is also being classified in terms of low, medium or high density. In theory, airlines can make a case to fly through all three provided they can prove they are taking adequate safety precautions. Irish carrier Ryanair has, however, condemned these limited restrictions as pointless. It said it has successfully piloted a test flight into an area of high ash density, with no adverse affects. What other differences are there? Scientists and airlines say the type of ash produced by Grimsvotn is potentially less harmful to aircraft engines than that thrown up by Eyjafjallajokull. According to a study by the Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland, ash particles from Eyjafjallajokull were unusually fine and angular due to the higher silica content of the magma produced in the eruption. This ""stickier"" magma caused a powerful explosion when it hit the volcano's ice cap, resulting in smaller and sharper ash particles capable of traveling further and remaining airborne longer. The larger particles produced by Grimsvotn, though still capable of traveling far, are more likely to fall out of the sky sooner. Jeremy Phillips of Bristol University's Earth Sciences department told CNN that Grimsvotn's eruptions are typically shorter than the Eyjafjallajokull event of 2010, lasting only a few days. What rights do affected passengers have? Last year's eruption left tens of thousands of passengers scrambling to make alternative travel plans via road, rail and sea amid debate over who was liable to compensate them for inconveniences faced. This year, the situation is far clearer, following court rulings over what is covered by travel insurance in the event of ash cloud disruption and clarified airline policy. According to UK consumer watchdog Which? delayed travelers are entitled to accommodation, food and phone calls. Those whose flights are canceled can expect refunds and re-routing to final destination.","Ash cloud prompts cancellation of dozens of flights, .

"(CNN) -- Call it a bigger, bolder version of the deadline-driven congressional stalemates over taxes and spending that have come to define Washington dysfunction of the past two years. The latest edition of political ""blinksmanship"" pits President Barack Obama and Democrats against Speaker John Boehner and Republicans on how to avoid the fiscal cliff -- automatic tax increases for everyone and deep spending cuts including for the military that will be triggered in the new year without an agreement. While the focus now is on a possible agreement in coming days or weeks, anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist told CNN on Monday that the nation should gird for long-range battle. ""This is a long fight. It's four years of a fight. It's not one week of a fight,"" said Norquist, who has threatened to mount primary challenges against Republicans who violate a pledge they signed at his behest against ever voting for a tax increase. Financial planners: How to survive fiscal cliff . With neither side showing any sign of blinking, however, the battlefield will probably shift to the Senate this week after GOP disarray in the House stymied any progress before Christmas. Congress and the president are taking a holiday break, with plans to return to work Thursday to try to find a deal in the final five days of the year. Economists warn that failing to avoid the fiscal cliff could spark recession, and stocks opened lower Monday amid no sign of the Washington impasse ending. According to multiple Democratic and Republican sources, no weekend conversations occurred between the White House and Senate leaders from either party or their aides. The main dispute continues to be over taxes, specifically the demand by Obama and Democrats to extend most of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets. Republicans oppose any kind of increase in tax rates, and Boehner suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise that his colleagues refused to support. While both sides say they want to avoid the fiscal cliff, signs are emerging that a deal would come after the new year to blunt the harshest impacts. Under that scenario, legislators would vote to lower taxes from the higher rates that will go into effect in January when the Bush cuts expire, with the new top rates staying intact. The sources described to CNN three possible options for moving ahead, all resting with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. One would be to amend a House measure passed in July that extends the Bush tax cuts for everyone. The changes would return to higher rates on top brackets, which Obama defines as family income up to $250,000, and also could include the president's call to extend unemployment benefits and some of the fiscal cliff spending cuts. Read more: Clock ticking on mortgage tax break for struggling homeowner . A second possibility would involve a Senate measure that Democrats passed in July with no Republican support. It calls for the Obama plan of extending the current tax cuts on family income up to $250,000. However, the Senate version has a constitutional problem because by law, measures that raise revenue must originate in the House. Boehner said Friday that the Senate plan has a ""blue slip"" problem, which refers to an objection that it is unconstitutional and therefore remains lodged in the Senate. While one Democratic source said the Senate version could get taken up in the House if Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell or Boehner don't raise a blue-slip objection, Republican sources rejected that scenario. Reid also could take a different revenue-raising bill from the House and rewrite it as a tax and spending measure to address fiscal cliff issues, the sources explained. With Republicans holding filibuster power in the Democratic-majority Senate, at least seven GOP senators would have to join Democrats on such a plan before the end of the year. With McConnell up for re-election in 2014, he is considered unlikely to risk angering the party's conservative base by supporting a compromise or allowing one to pass on a simple majority vote that would need no GOP backing, sources said. In the new Senate that will convene in early January, the number of Republicans needed to pass a deal would be five because of Democratic gains in November, when Obama won re-election. According to a senior administration official, the president is still holding to his promise not to sign a short-term bill that extends Bush-era tax cuts across the board to buy time for a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff. So, absent a deal that includes increasing income-tax rates for wealthy Americans, the country is still headed for the cliff. But the administration official told CNN it's still possible to resolve the impasse: ""The unanimous desire to avoid the fiscal cliff will hopefully animate everybody,"" the official said. According to a Senate Republican leadership aide, Republicans reject Obama's $250,000 threshold for tax cut extensions. Meanwhile, a Senate Democratic leadership aide lamented McConnell's apparent unwillingness to negotiate. ""We're going to be here New Year's Eve,"" retiring Sen. Joe Lieberman said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" adding that it was likely the nation would go over the fiscal cliff. Failing to meet the year-end deadline on striking a deal would amount to ""the most colossal, consequential act of congressional irresponsibility in a long time,"" said Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with Democrats. ""Maybe ever in American history, because of the impact it will have on almost every American."" However, Norquist called the situation part of a longer process. ""This is not a fight that begins and ends the first week of January,"" he said, predicting ""a regular fight"" when Congress needs to authorize more government spending and raise the federal debt ceiling in coming months. ""There the Republicans have a lot of clout because they can say we'll let you run the government for the next month, but you've got to make these reforms,"" he explained. How might the ""fiscal cliff"" affect you? Obama spoke separately Friday with Boehner and Reid to try to salvage a fiscal cliff deal by the end of year, then delivered a previously unscheduled statement to reporters at the White House. He acknowledged what has become obvious: The broader deficit reduction deal he seeks will probably come in stages, rather than in the so-called grand bargain he and Boehner have been trying to negotiate. In particular, Obama called for Congress to come back after Christmas and work with him on a limited agreement to prevent tax hikes on the middle class, extend unemployment insurance and set a framework for future deficit reduction steps. Boehner's spokesman said the speaker will be ""ready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress"" when he returns to Washington, as now planned for Thursday. The GOP opposition to any kind of tax rate increase has stalled deficit negotiations for two years and led to unusual political drama, such as McConnell recently filibustering a proposal he introduced and Thursday night's rebuff by House Republicans of an alternative tax plan pushed by Boehner, their leader. Boehner said at a news conference Friday that his Republican colleagues refused to back his plan, which would have extended all tax cuts except for income of more than $1 million, because of fears of being blamed for a tax increase. The negotiations with Obama on a broad deficit reduction agreement hit an impasse last week when both sides offered their ""bottom line"" positions, Boehner said. In what was considered as progress just a week ago, the president and speaker made major concessions but remained a few hundred billion dollars apart. Reid and other Senate Democrats say House Republicans must accept that agreement will require support from legislators in both parties. He insisted that the Senate-passed plan with Obama's $250,000 threshold, which polls show is strongly supported by the public, would pass the House if Boehner would allow a vote. Some House Republicans have said they would join Democrats in supporting the president's proposal in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on the spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek. The possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt. Now, legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction, such as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Polling has consistently shown most Americans back the president, who insists wealthy Americans must pay more, rather than Boehner and his Republican colleagues, who have balked at tax rate hikes and demanded spending cuts and entitlement program reforms. A new CNN/ORC International survey last week found that just over half of respondents believe Republicans should give up more in any solution and consider the party's policies too extreme. The two sides seemingly had made progress early last week on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. The president's latest offer set $400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase, up from his original plan of $250,000. It also included a new formula for the consumer price index applied to some entitlement benefits, much to the chagrin of liberals. Called chained CPI, the new formula includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years. Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. Liberal groups sought to mount a pressure campaign against including the chained CPI after news emerged this week that Obama was willing to include it, calling the plan a betrayal of senior citizens who had contributed throughout their lives for their benefits. CNN's Brianna Keilar in Hawaii and Dana Bash in Washington reported this story, which was written by Tom Cohen in Washington.","Who will blink first in Washington's fiscal cliff showdown?

"(CNN) -- After plummeting for three months, gas prices are working their way back up, according to a survey published Sunday. The average price of a gallon of regular is $3.32, up more than 6 cents from three weeks earlier, the Lundberg Survey found. Over 11 weeks between October and late December, the average dropped 58 cents a gallon. Crude oil prices have jumped, triggering higher prices at the pump, said publisher Trilby Lundberg. ""Refiners have passed through only about half of the price hike that they received. So if crude oil prices stay approximately where they are, we will see a few more cents at the pump -- maybe 5 or 6 cents (per gallon) in the coming days."" Demand is generally lowest in January, so it is not expected to be a factor pushing up gas prices any time soon. The current price is about 3 cents lower than it was a year ago. The Lundberg Survey tabulates prices at thousands of gas stations nationwide. The highest average found in the latest survey was in New York's Long Island, at $3.75 per gallon. The lowest was in Salt Lake City, at $2.76. Taxes are part of what causes such difference in prices in different areas. Here are the latest averages in some other cities: . Boston - $3.53 . Atlanta - $3.35 . Birmingham, Alabama - $3.17 . Chicago - $3.45 . El Paso, Texas - $2.99 . Tulsa, Oklahoma - $2.92 . Tucson, Arizona - $2.85 . Seattle - $3.43 .

"(CNN) -- For 50 years one spy has outfoxed, outgunned, and outdressed every villain thrown his way. His name? Bond ... James Bond. Now a new 007 exhibition in London is celebrating the half century since the world's most famous secret agent first appeared on screen. It was 1962 when Sean Connery's Bond defeated Dr. No and floated off into the sunset with Honey Ryder. Today the first Bond Girl's bikini is one of more than 400 items on display in an exhibition tracing the design of the one of the world's most profitable film franchises. From Scaramanga's golden gun to Daniel Craig's tiny trunks in the 2006 remake of ""Casino Royale,"" the Barbican Centre exhibition in London allows fans to follow in 007's footsteps on a journey from 1962 up through Bond's golden anniversary ahead of ""Skyfall"", which is due to be released in October. ""Adventure films have come and gone, but James Bond has remained a huge box office draw throughout,"" exhibition co-curator Bronwyn Cosgrave told CNN. ""And he's also the best-dressed man in cinema history."" James Bond's 'Quantum of Solace' speedboat is show's star turn . Fans are greeted at the gallery's exhibition by a waxwork of Sean Connery leaning against a replica of Bond's famous 1964 Aston Martin DB5 car. From there, a bullet-shaped entry way leads through to the Gold Room, which features a life-sized recreation of character Jill Masterson's death by gold paint from the 1964 film ""Goldfinger."" ""Shirley Eaton's golden body is one of the most iconic Bond images, and we went to great lengths to cast a form -- not just a mannequin -- to painstakingly make a body that resembled her nubile proportions from Goldfinger,"" Cosgrave said. The exhibition's narrative arc is formulated much like a Bond film: visitors pass through M's office, where Britain's top spy received his mission orders, to Q Branch, where he picked up his latest gadgets. A montage of the casino scenes from every Bond film play on the walls of the casino room before visitors take a trip through the ""real, fictional, and otherworldly"" exotic locations of 007's many adventures. Idris Elba: I'd consider playing James Bond . The exhibition also traces the evolution of Bond's formidable wardrobe, from Connery's Savile Row-made tuxedos to Pierce Brosnan's Brioni suits, and showcases a number of Bond Girl dresses, including Halle Berry's Versace dress from ""Die Another Day."" Cosgrave and her colleagues dug deep into the 007 archive in order to find pieces that evoke design in Bond films. ""This is the only exhibition where Bond is a supporting character -- equally iconic are the sets, the gadgets, and the costumes,"" she said. The costumes are remarkable, but at the end of the day Bond is a man of action -- which is why the exhibition's grand finale culminates in the Ice Palace from ""Die Another Day,"" where visitors are surrounded with footage of 007's many chase scenes in the snow. The exhibition ends where many of the spy's adventures began: at the bar with a martini -- shaken, not stirred, obviously -- in classic Bond fashion.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of Bernard Madoff's four homes and other assets after Madoff's guilty plea to masterminding a massive investment fraud. Convicted investment swindler Bernard Madoff is shown in his federal mug shot. Madoff is in jail at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan after pleading guilty to operating on the largest Ponzi schemes in history. He faces 150 years in prison when he is sentenced June 16. Many of the assets are held in the name of Madoff's wife, Ruth. That should not prevent the government from seizing them, said former federal prosecutor Bradley Simon of Simon & Partners. ""Since she was in the business, too, it's going to be hard to show these assets came from another source other than through the business,"" said Simon. ""It's pretty easy to show this property derived from the proceeds of the illegal activity. They'll be able to take every nickel from him."" The targeted assets include:  • A Manhattan condominium valued at $7 million on East 64th Street, where Madoff was under house arrest for three months before his guilty plea. • Homes in Montauk, New York; Palm Beach, Florida; and Cap d'Antibes, France, as well as ""all insured and readily salable personal property"" contained in the homes. • A yacht named Bull, docked in France; three other boats and four automobiles: two Mercedes, one BMW and one Volkswagen. • A Steinway piano valued at $39,000 and a silverware set valued at $65,000. • $17 million deposited at Wachovia Bank, $45 million in securities held at COHMAD Securities and Madoff's interest in COHMAD Securities. Madoff defense attorney Daniel Horowitz said he had no comment. Madoff's lawyers listed the assets in court papers filed Friday. They estimated his worth at up to $826 million. His business has an estimated worth of $700 million, according to the documents. Madoff was ordered to jail Thursday after pleading guilty to 11 criminal counts, admitting operating a Ponzi scheme estimated to have bilked thousands of investors out of billions of dollars.","Feds seek forfeiture of Bernard Madoff's riches .

"Editor's note: Wayne LaPierre has served as the executive vice president and chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association of America since 1991. His latest book is ""The Global War on Your Guns: Inside the U.N. Plan to Destroy the Bill of Rights."" Wayne LaPierre says the Mexican drug war isn't a reason to restrict gun ownership in the U.S. (CNN) -- Here's a summary for the time- or attention-challenged: Never surrender freedom for laws that can't affect criminals; they disobey laws for a living. Nobody is surprised that Attorney General Eric Holder wants to make good on his promise to ban guns. We just didn't know whose tragedy he'd seize to advance his agenda. Now we do. It's the drug-driven death and violence in Mexico at the hands of ruthless criminal cartels. Barely a month on the job, Holder cited the Mexican cartel killings as the excuse to resurrect the Clinton gun ban. Though a new face to some, Holder is a rabid Second Amendment foe from the Clinton administration who helped orchestrate the 1994 Clinton gun ban. America has made this mistake already. So let's learn the lies that led to their gun ban. Even earthworms learn from experience . Ask any anti-gun politician to define an ""assault weapon,"" and the honest answer is, ""I know one when I see one."" When cosmetics alone can infringe constitutional freedoms, we're all in trouble. But that's precisely how the 1994 gun ban came about. The gun-ban lobby and national media lied with lockstep conformity by playing endless footage of fully automatic machine gun fire. They fooled the American people and the U.S. Congress into thinking they were banning ""high-powered,"" ""rapid-fire,"" ""battlefield-bred"" guns designed to ""spray fire from the hip."" None of that was true. Then Sen. Dianne Feinstein convened anti-gun bureaucrats to conduct a firearm beauty pageant. They browsed photos of hundreds of perfectly legal semiautomatic rifles. They picked 19 they deemed most military looking. And they banned them. But the guns aren't designed or used by the military. They're commonly owned semiautomatic rifles that fire one shot when the trigger is pulled. They cannot ""spray fire,"" nor are they designed to be fired ""from the hip."" Nor are they the choice of terrorists in Afghanistan or drug gangs in Mexico. They prefer fully automatic machine guns, which our soldiers use. Congress was so doubtful about the ban's effectiveness, they limited it to a 10-year experiment. So it expired in 2004, and for good reason. It was useless all along. As the study mandated by that Congress found, ""The banned weapons and magazines were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders"" in the first place. The ban had absolutely no effect on gun crime. But what about Mexico? Of course, everyone's rooting for Mexican President Felipe Calderon's government to crush the drug cartels' stranglehold. But our rights are not what's wrong. Nobody can substantiate claims that U.S. guns cross the border ""by the thousands"" or ""account for 95% of weapons used by Mexican drug gangs."" Because it's not true. Replying to Feinstein in subcommittee hearings last week, William Hoover, assistant director of field operations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said, ""The investigations we have, that we see, for firearms flowing across the border don't show us individuals taking thousands of guns a day or at a time flowing into Mexico."" Yet reporter after politician after news anchor parrot the lie as readily as high schoolers gossip, and with equal disregard for truth. That's how gun abolitionists claim Mexican gun laws are so strict that our ""weak laws"" (read: freedoms) are to blame for ""fueling the violence"" in Mexico. Well, to believe that: . • You have to believe these butchers and beheaders break every Mexican law they want except Mexican gun laws, which they honor -- while they break America gun laws. • You have to believe that Mexico's drug cartels, which possess the wealth and armies of nations, prefer American semiauto target and hunting rifles over fully automatic machine guns and any other military arms they want to crush opposition. • You have to believe Mexican drug lords -- who make Forbes magazine's list of billionaires -- don't get large lots of weaponry on the transnational black market but instead choose to trifle with paperwork at U.S. gun stores. • You have to believe that narco-terrorists who buy fragmentation grenades, grenade launchers, explosives, body armor, biometric security equipment, infrared surveillance technology and intelligence-grade reconnaissance gear will salute and obey a new American gun law -- if only we'd pass one. Get real, get tough, but get away from our rights . Everything Mexico's murderous thugs are doing is already illegal. At issue is not the absence of law, but the absence of political will to enforce the laws that both nations already possess. Even Immigration and Customs Enforcement said, ""We have the laws we need. We just need to more effectively enforce them."" Those that make possible Mexico's colossal corruption wear the garb of not only drug lords and gun runners, but also of too many city mayors and police chiefs, state bureaucrats and military officers. A $40 billion criminal enterprise could not exist without the complicity of these powerful co-conspirators. And these cartels are being abetted by American media and politicians who blame our freedoms for it. We should seal the border. Punish the guilty. And use existing gun and drug laws against violent drug syndicates here and in Mexico. But leave American freedoms alone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wayne LaPierre.","Wayne LaPierre: Effort under way to reinstate Clinton-era gun ban .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- As the last U.S. soldiers exited Iraq Sunday and debate was raging about the nation's future, political crisis erupted in Baghdad that raised fears of more sectarian strife to come. Iraqiya, a powerful political bloc that draws support largely from Sunni and more secular Iraqis, said it was boycotting parliament, a move that threatens to shatter Iraq's fragile power-sharing government. The move pits the largely Sunni and secular coalition against the government of Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Iraqiya contends al-Maliki is trying to amass dictatorial power and many believe al-Maliki was simply waiting for the Americans to leave before making his move. It all makes for burgeoning political chaos and raises serious questions about whether democracy and human rights can take root in the war-ravaged nation. ""The only country that makes U.S. politics look like a picnic is Iraq,"" said Christopher Hill, the former U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. Al-Maliki, Hill said, is a man who perceives concessions as weakness. He's a tough guy who knows what he's doing, Hill said. He managed to forge relationships with the Kurds and peel off some Sunni support to build the majority he needed to put together a government, Hill said. But whether he is the man to unify Iraq, to lead it now, without American presence, is uncertain. His rivals say that al-Maliki still controls the country's security ministries and all decisions go through him. They also say that the hundreds of people seized by the government in October for backing terrorism and supporting the banned Baath Party are Iraqiya supporters. Iraqiya spokesman Haider al-Mulla said the bloc has always warned about power-sharing and deal's risks that al-Maliki's State of Law Alliance party has been violating the law. ""Iraqiya has always expressed its rejection to the policy of exclusion and marginalization, lack of power sharing, politicization of the judiciary, the lack of balance within the government institutions,"" al-Mulla said. Al-Maliki is asking lawmakers to withdraw confidence from his deputy after Saleh al-Mutlaq made controversial comments this week over American forces withdrawing from Iraq, state media reported late Saturday. In a CNN interview, al-Mutlaq had accused al-Maliki of amassing dictatorial power. ""There will be a day whereby the Americans will realize that they were deceived by al-Maliki ... and they will regret that,"" said al-Mutlaq, a leader within the Iraqiya movement. Also at issue were reports that an arrest warrant had been issued for Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi for masterminding a recent car bombing targeting al-Maliki and the parliament. Ali al-Mussawi, al-Maliki's media adviser, said there were confessions that linked the Sunni vice president to the bombing. Al-Mussawi dismissed the notion that linking al-Hashimi to terrorism was politically motivated. He would not confirm whether an arrest warrant had indeed been issued, saying that was a matter for the judiciary. But tensions were running high after the Iraqiya bloc, headed by former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, made its move Friday night. There had been fears of renewed bloodshed between Iraq's majority Shiite and minority Sunni populations and that prompted U.S. officials to work out a power-sharing agreement, bringing the Iraqiya movement into the government. Al-Mutlaq told CNN that Washington is leaving Iraq ""with a dictator"" who has ignored the power-sharing agreement, kept control of the country's security forces and rounded up hundreds of people in recent weeks. He said he was ""shocked"" to hear U.S. President Barack Obama greet al-Maliki at the White House on Monday as ""the elected leader of a sovereign, self-reliant and democratic Iraq."" ""America left Iraq with almost no infrastructure. The political process is going in a very wrong direction, going toward a dictatorship,"" he said. ""People are not going to accept that, and most likely they are going to ask for the division of the country. And this is going to be a disaster. Dividing the country isn't going to be smooth, because dividing the country is going to be a war before that and a war after that."" Neighboring Iran, predominantly Shiite and led by a Shiite regime, views al-Maliki as its man in Baghdad and has dictated the shape of the current government, al-Mutlaq said. But he said al-Maliki is playing games with both Washington and Tehran. Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish member of parliament, said lawmakers discussed the Iraqiya move on Saturday and said it reflects ""a level of mistrust between the blocs, the government, Iraqiya and others. ""The problem is that Maliki isn't sharing any security decisions with Iraqiya, he doesn't trust them and this is a big problem,"" he said. ""Power-sharing was never power-sharing. We are in a government of conflict. Power-sharing was never successful. ""The Kurds don't want to take sides, we want them (Iraqiya and State of Law Alliance) to get together to solve their problems."" He is worried that the problem could morph into fighting between Sunnis and Shiites or violence against the government. ""This isn't just political,"" he said. ""It's sectarian.""","The largely Sunni and secular Iraqiya bloc is boycotting parliament .

"(CNN) -- It's the million-dollar reward that's raising a million-dollar question: Who, if anyone, is entitled to the money offered in the hunt for Christopher Dorner? The catch is that Dorner, the rogue former Los Angeles police officer who sparked a massive manhunt, was never captured. He died after a shootout and fire at a California mountain cabin this week after, authorities say, he killed four people and wounded three others. The city of Los Angeles put up the $1 million reward Sunday, together with other jurisdictions, groups, and private donors. It had been a few days since Dorner was last seen, and they wanted to generate tips. Dorner died from single gunshot to head . ""Collectively this group, led by my office, is posting a reward of $1 million for information that will lead to Mr. Dorner's capture,"" said Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa. Now that the hunt for Dorner is over, the Los Angeles Police Department says it's deciding what to do with the reward money. ""More than 20 jurisdictions and entities are involved in this reward, so all of them will be coming together to collectively determine whether any individual(s) qualify for it,"" the LAPD said in a statement Friday. ""Our personal hope is that the reward will be distributed, but we must follow the rules and respect the procedures of each entity."" Former girlfriend: Dorner was stressed out . The police department said they have had a lot of inquiries about the reward. It reminded the public that no money can be distributed until the investigation is complete. One person who feels he deserves the reward is camp ranger Rick Heltebrake, one of Dorner's last victims. Heltebrake was driving Tuesday near Big Bear Lake, California, when Dorner approached him, put a gun to his head and stole his truck. Dorner was on the run from California Fish and Wildlife wardens who had spotted him on the area's icy roads. Dorner and the wardens exchanged gunfire before Dorner crashed his car, carjacked Heltebrake's truck and drove it to the nearby cabin. Ex-LAPD cop gains sympathizers on social media . After Dorner drove off, Heltebrake said he ducked off the road and called his friend, a sheriff's deputy, to alert him. Speaking Thursday to CNN about the reward, Heltebrake said, ""I do think I deserve it. I believe it was my phone call to that sheriff's deputy that directed them to the location where Dorner was, and I believe it was my phone call that put an end to the largest manhunt in Los Angeles history."" Heltebrake said he wants to use the reward money to set up college funds for the children of the two law enforcement officers killed by Dorner. He also mentioned possible improvements to the scout camp where he works, which he said is rundown. ""Did anybody ever believe that he was going to be captured and convicted? I don't think so,"" Heltebrake told CNN's Randi Kaye. ""I think they put that (clause) in there possibly to have an out for later. I believe that that money was put up by the private sector and basically corporate donors, not from taxpayer money or anything like that, and I believe those people wanted that money to go somewhere, and I'd like to do some good with it."" Heltebrake said he could split the money with Karen and Jim Reynolds, the couple who encountered Dorner in their Big Bear-area condo Tuesday morning, before the carjacking. Though Dorner tied up the couple, they managed to free themselves and call 911. ""If they want half of it, I believe they're deserving of half of it,"" Heltebrake said. Speaking Wednesday after their ordeal, the Reynolds said they were simply happy to be alive and hadn't thought much about the reward money.","City put up $1 million reward in Dorner case .

"(CNN) -- It's pretty rare for sitting presidents to visit Israel. Only four have done so since the state of Israel was created (Nixon, Carter, Clinton and George W. Bush). So why is Barack Obama going? And why is this president -- so early in his second term -- reaching out to an Israeli prime minister with whom he has such a tense and dysfunctional relationship? Indeed, given the personality and policy differences that separate Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, why not let new Secretary of State John Kerry handle this file for a while? Here's why Obama's going. Clearing away old business . Four years in, the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has become increasingly dysfunctional, and as leaders of close allies, they simply can't afford not to find a better way to communicate. It's also smart politics. Whether Obama intends to push Netanyahu on peace process issues or pander to him, it's important to get the visit thing out of the way early in the second term. Obama went to Cairo, Egypt, and gave a big speech to bond with the Arabs and Muslims in his first term. That eventually proved to be more words than deeds. But warm words delivered with real empathy would soften Obama's image among many Israelis who see only his hard edge. Go early with no expectations . It's much better to go quickly when there are no expectations that the presidential trip will produce dramatic deliverables than to wait and hope it will be easier to come up with results later. The longer Obama delays the greater the expectations and the less chance he'll have of producing anything. Indeed, by folding Jordan and the West Bank into the agenda he makes a virtue out of a necessity. This is a chance for the president to survey the real estate, buck up King Abdullah II, do something for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, too, particularly at a time when his rival Hamas seems to be scoring gains. And there's nothing wrong with reconfirming America's commitment to Israeli-Palestinian peace at a time when the focus has been on Syria, Egypt and Iran. There's serious work to be done . Obama is confronting the prospects of two catastrophes on his watch -- seeing Iran go nuclear and the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict expire. Israel, and more importantly his relationship with Netanyahu, can play a key role in preventing those things from happening. That Obama is coming to Bibi, particularly given the tension between them, offers Netanyahu -- who needs Obama, too, to deal with Iran -- a way to correct the course. Indeed, the two must begin to test whether or not they can develop a strategic understanding of how to sequence and deal with Iran and the Palestinian issue. The fact is neither can accomplish their objectives without much closer cooperation. Obama needs to reassure Netanyahu that if the Israelis give him time and space to pursue diplomacy with Iran and that talking fails, the United States will stop Iran from weaponizing with military force. In the interim, Obama needs to hear that Netanyahu won't complicate his life by pushing high-profile settlement activity and that Israel will agree to negotiate in good faith on some of the final status issues such as security and territory. In return, Obama will not press Netanyahu on the identity issues, Jerusalem and refugees for now. Changing Obama's image . Obama is our first post-""Exodus"" president. Leon Uris' 1958 novel, ""Exodus,"" and the 1960 movie version were heroic portrayals of pre-state Israelis in the aftermath of the Nazi genocide confronting insensitive British and fanatic Arabs. Obama was 6 at the time of Israel's stunning victory in the 1967 war. He doesn't relate emotionally to the underdog tropes of Israel as the embattled nation, and grew up in an academic world where being supportive of Israel really wasn't all that important. Unlike the movie ""Exodus,"" to Obama, the Israelis aren't the stalwart cowboys outgunned and outnumbered by the Palestinian Indians. And unlike Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, Obama doesn't seem to relate intuitively to the idea of Israel but situates it far more along a national interest than a values continuum. Obama doesn't always emote, but when he does, he can be very effective. His visit to Israel will give him an opportunity to show empathy in a powerful manner and help create a bond. Obama will never be Clinton; he doesn't have to be. But he does need to demonstrate that he gets it -- that for all of Israel's formidable power and muscle and technological prowess, it's still a small country with a dark past living often on the knife's edge in a very rough neighborhood. One visit won't a transformed relationship make. But in the wake of last month's Israeli elections, where a centrist party became the Knesset's second-largest, Obama may find settlement activity somewhat restrained, with Israelis demonstrating some additional flexibility on the Palestinian issue, and perhaps an easing in some of his tensions with Netanyahu. Let's hope so. The Obama-Bibi soap opera has gone on for too long. The soap opera needs to stop. Common sense and the vital national interests of both Israel and the United States, not to mention the peace and prosperity of a good part of the Middle East, depend upon it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Aaron David Miller: Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu have a tense relationship .

"Washington (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress Tuesday that he is prepared to make ""painful compromises"" for a peace deal with Palestinians, but reiterated his insistence that Israel will never return to the boundaries that existed before the 1967 Middle East war. While asserting he is prepared to be ""generous"" in regard to the size of a future Palestinian state, Netanyahu stressed the importance of keeping control over certain densely settled areas within the West Bank.  He stressed that Israeli security will be a major consideration in the establishment of future boundaries. The prime minister flatly ruled out any so-called ""right of return"" for Palestinian families who left Israel after the state's founding in 1948. ""Jews from around the world have a right to immigrate to the Jewish state,"" Netanyahu said.  ""Palestinians from around the world should have a right to immigrate, if they so choose, to a Palestinian state.  This means that the Palestinian refugee problem will be resolved outside the borders of Israel."" The prime minister blamed Palestinians for refusing to recognize the Jewish state's right to exist, and repeated his demand that Jerusalem remain united as Israel's capital. Netanyahu's speech in the House chamber -- a rare honor for a foreign leader -- was perceived by many observers as a response to President Barack Obama's call last Thursday for peace talks based on the 1967 lines with ""mutually agreed"" land swaps. Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, were both on hand for the Israeli leader's remarks.  Netanyahu was warmly received by Democrats and Republicans alike. Top Palestinian officials, however, argued that Netanyahu's terms did not convey a serious desire to pursue a resolution. ""I am willing to make painful compromises to achieve this historic peace,"" Netanyahu declared.  ""In a genuine peace, we'll be required to give up parts of the ancestral Jewish homeland. ""Some settlements will end up beyond Israel's (current) borders,"" he acknowledged.  But ""Israel will not return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967."" Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza, Golan Heights and Sinai Peninsula during the 1967 war.  The Sinai has since been returned to Egypt.  Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, a move not recognized by the international community and condemned by Syria, which still claims the land. The more militant Palestinian group Hamas now controls Gaza, while the more moderate group Fatah administers the West Bank, site of a growing number of Israeli settlements. Ultimately, the Palestinians are aiming to unite Gaza and the West Bank under the authority of a new state. Netanyahu flatly ruled out negotiations with Hamas, which is recognized as a terrorist organization by both the United States and Israel.  He also dismissed prospects of United Nations recognition of a Palestinian state later this year. ""Peace cannot be imposed.  It must be negotiated,"" he said. At the same time, Netanyahu insisted Israel must be allowed to maintain a military presence along the Jordan River, the eastern boundary of the West Bank. For their part, Palestinian officials have refused to enter into new talks with Israel on the decades-old conflict until Israel stops building settlements on occupied West Bank land the Palestinians see as part of their future state. Looking beyond the dispute with the Palestinians, Netanyahu highlighted the growing danger posed by a nuclear-armed Iran. ""Time is running out,"" Netanyahu warned.  ""The greatest danger facing humanity could soon be upon us: A militant Islamic regime armed with nuclear weapons. ""If history has taught the Jewish people anything, it is that we must take calls for our destruction seriously,"" he said.  ""We are a nation that rose from the ashes of the Holocaust.  When we say never again, we mean never again.  Israel always reserves the right to defend itself."" The Israeli leader congratulated the Obama administration for the recent U.S. military mission resulting in the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. ""Congratulations America,"" he said.  ""You got bin Laden.  Good riddance."" One top Palestinian official blasted the tone of Netanyahu's remarks, insisting that the Israeli leader ""is not in a negotiation mood but rather a dictation mood."" ""He wants to impose on the Palestinian people what he sees as the future of the Palestinian state,"" said Sabri Saidam, deputy speaker of the Fatah Council. ""Then he wants to call upon the Palestinians to sit for peace.  What peace?  He's turned peace into a process that he likes, and he's turned the country into pieces."" ""This is more of a Swiss cheese state that Netanyahu wants to come into being,"" Saidam argued. Nabil Shaath, another senior member of Fatah, criticized Netanyahu's refusal to consider a right of return for the descendents of Palestinians who left around the time of Israel's founding. Israel is ""talking about the right for a people to go back to a land they thought they had 4,000 years ago, but for refugees from Palestine that were driven out of their land only 60 years ago, this is an impossibility for them to get back to their homes,"" Shaath said. Without serious peace talks, the Palestinian Authority will seek a formal recognition of statehood at the United Nations in September, Shaath insisted.  He dismissed the ""furor"" over the role of Hamas in such talks, calling it a ""pretext for not going into any serious negotiations."" Shaath also said the repeated applause for Netanyahu by members of Congress calls into ""serious question ... the even-handedness of America when it comes to a question that is that important to the people of Palestine and the people of the Middle East."" Netanyahu's speech on Capitol Hill was disrupted briefly by a protester who was heard screaming, ""Equal rights for Palestine,"" before police escorted her out of the chamber. Capitol Police identified the woman as Rachel Abileah and said she was charged with unlawfully disrupting Congress, a misdemeanor. On Monday night, activists from the American anti-war activist group Code Pink interrupted Netanyahu's speech to the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee at least twice. The group criticized what it called ""the theft of Palestinian land"" and the Israeli blockade of Gaza. AIPAC is a major force in U.S. politics, drawing top administration and congressional leaders to its conventions. In his own speech to AIPAC on Sunday, Obama asserted that the ""status quo"" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is unsustainable.  The president also insisted once again that Israel's pre-1967 borders should be the starting point for negotiations over the shape of a future Palestinian state. The proposal is a long-standing formulation in peace talks that Obama has now expressed as official U.S. policy for the first time. ""It is a well-known formula to all who have worked on this issue for a generation,"" Obama said to applause. ""It allows the parties themselves to account for the changes that have taken place over the last 44 years,"" including the new demographic realities on the ground and the needs of both sides."" But Obama also criticized the Palestinian push to seek U.N. recognition of an independent state, and a Palestinian Authority-Hamas agreement to hold unifying elections in 2012.

"(CNN) -- How were inmates inside a Texas prison allegedly able to make cell phone calls, plot crimes and acquire drugs? With the help of 17 former corrections officers who once worked at the prison, according to a federal grand jury indictment unsealed this week. Now the former officers and 12 others have been arrested and charged with racketeering after a four-year investigation authorities dubbed Operation Prison Cell. The former guards are accused of involvement in a smuggling scheme that undermined the justice system, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson told reporters Wednesday. ""Prison is a place where inmates are supposed to do their time,"" he said, ""not where they do their crime."" Using the cell phones guards smuggled in, prison inmates orchestrated and facilitated killings, home invasions and drug trafficking, said Angela Dodge, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office. The indictment released Wednesday accuses 13 former corrections officers of smuggling cell phones into the McConnell Unit Prison in Beeville, Texas, about 200 miles southwest of Houston. Read the indictment (pdf) ""The employees supplied the phones, knowing the inmates would use the phones to conduct illegal activities,"" the indictment says. A four-year investigation into the ""culture of corruption"" at the prison began after authorities caught gang members trying to transport stolen cars that were destined for Mexican cartel members across the border, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas said Wednesday. Prison inmates using illegal cell phones were behind the thwarted attempt to move the stolen cars into Mexico, prosecutors said. Nationwide, the smuggling of contraband cell phones into prisons is a growing problem, the U.S. General Accountability Office said in a 2011 report, noting that the number of smuggled phones seized had quadrupled in a three-year period. In 2007 an inmate at a Maryland detention center ordered the murder of a witness to his crimes using a contraband phone, the report said. And in 2008, a death row inmate in a Texas state prison used a cell phone to threaten a state senator and his family. This month's indictment doesn't detail how much money guards at the McConnell Unit Prison allegedly received in exchange for the cell phones. But in 2009, one top Texas investigator told CNN that a smuggled cell phone could fetch as much as $2,000. In the McConnell Unit Prison, authorities said Wednesday that rampant corruption had festered since 2005. Thirteen of the former guards arrested are charged with racketeering, and four face drug charges, Dodge said. In total, authorities have arrested 29 people in connection with the alleged scheme. Three others are still at large, Dodge said. Now, authorities said, some of the former correction officers who once guarded the Texas prison are behind bars themselves. CNN's Dave Alsup and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Former prison guards are charged with racketeering for allegedly smuggling cell phones .

"(CNN) -- Judging by the 5 a.m. call I got yesterday from a national news network, and from the barrage of in-print, online and televised discussion I saw as the day wore on, it is clear that the revelation that Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. is being treated at a ""residential treatment facility"" for a mood disorder has raised far more questions than it has answered. The key issues in the media debate/discussion appear to be: What is a mood disorder, and would the treatment of a mood disorder really require prolonged treatment at a residential facility? Being told someone has a mood disorder is a little bit like learning someone has cancer. There is no such thing as ""cancer,"" only specific types of cancer, which vary hugely from one another in location, symptoms and prognosis and need for treatment. Like cancer, ""mood disorder"" is a general term for a group of disorders that can vary widely in terms of symptoms, prognosis and treatment. A mood disorder can be a mild depressive episode that sends a high-functioning person to a counselor for support and guidance, or it can be a florid psychotic episode that lands a previously law-abiding citizen in jail, or worse. If the congressman were in a hospital being treated for cancer, our sense of decorum might restrain us from digging deeper into the issue. But if we did dig, we'd want to know what kind of cancer he had, what his prognosis was (will he recover or die, and if the latter when), what kind of treatment he will need and how this treatment will impact his ability to serve in the government. Pelosi: Jackson should take all the time he needs . People are notoriously less restrained in their curiosity about psychiatric disease than cancer, but the questions are the same. In relation to the congressman we want to know what kind of mood disorder he has, what is the likelihood he'll recover, what treatment will he need and how will the illness and his treatment impact his ability to work. Of course, we have no idea what kind of mood disorder he has, so all I can do here is give a brief outline of what kind of mood disorder he might have. In mood disorders, the overriding symptoms are all tied to disturbances in how people feel. Most of us spend our lives in moderate moods, but most of us have also experienced some mood extremes -- those times when we've felt profoundly down or depressed and other times when we've felt remarkably excited and euphoric. Mood disorders exist at these extremes of thought and feeling. They have two additional characteristics. First, they are characterized by mood states that are more intense than people normally experience in their daily lives. Second, mood disorders are conditions in which mood gets stuck. While most of us feel better or worse based on what's happening in our lives, but always within limits, people with serious mood disorders often remain frozen in states of profound despair or unrealistic euphoria for extended periods. The vast majority of people with mood disorders will only experience depressive episodes. Although estimates vary, somewhere between 20% and 40% of people living in the modern world will have at least one episode of major depression in their lifetime. Many people who have a first episode will go on to have repeated episodes with the passage of time. Depressive episodes are true mind-body experiences: people feel down, blue, sad or frightened and they lose pleasure in life, but they also experience physical/bodily symptoms such as sleep and appetite changes, fatigue and often physical aches and pains. A small minority of people with mood disorders will have a manic episode. Unlike depression, which all of us understand to some degree or other from our own experience, a full mania is a shocking thing to see. With one or two exceptions, all the most outrageous things I've seen as a psychiatrist (and I've seen many shocking sites) occurred in the context of manic episodes. Manic people do the most astounding and bizarre things imaginable. And many people in the grips of mania have assured me that I could have no idea of how they were thinking and feeling. I think this is true. Mania starts at the happiest, the most excited, the most grandiose you've ever felt and just goes straight up from there. Manic people often feel incredibly euphoric and energized. They don't sleep. They don't eat. They talk constantly at high speeds. They feel incredibly important and powerful. From this perspective they take terrible chances and do foolish things, believing everything will work to their favor. When things get really intense they often begin hearing voices, not infrequently the voice of God, and they develop delusions about their place in the world. For example, I've had manic patients believe they were Jesus, the Virgin Mary, Hitler's girlfriend and Michael Jackson. If you've watched your own moods closely, you may have noticed that after times of especially high spirits you might be more prone than usual to irritability. This same phenomenon rules within the world of manias. Even when euphoric, most manic patients are dangerously irritable if they are opposed by others. And with time, most euphoric episodes morph into states of rage and displeasure. This may account for the fact that people are more likely to commit suicide when manic than when depressed. As I've said, many people with mood disorders only have depressions, and this disease pattern is often referred to as ""unipolar depression."" On the other hand, almost everyone who has a manic episode also will have depressions, and in fact likely will have far more depressive than manic episodes. For this reason, people with manias and depressions are diagnosed as having ""bipolar disorder,"" a condition also known as manic-depression. A small minority of people (mostly men) will only have manias, but modern psychiatry has no special category for these ""unipolar manic"" folks -- they are considered to have bipolar disorder on the bet that sooner or later a depression will creep into the mix. Both unipolar major depression and bipolar disorder have been shown to benefit from similar types of psychotherapy. On the other hand, different pharmacological strategies are usually required for bipolar and unipolar mood disorders. Antidepressants are the mainstay of medical treatment for unipolar major depression. On the other hand, many patients with bipolar disorder actually seem to do worse when treated with antidepressants and respond preferentially to medications that stabilize mood and/or reduce psychotic symptoms. Classic examples of mood stabilizers are lithium and valproic acid. Multiple new and older anti-psychotic agents are available for the treatment of bipolar disorder. These agents are very effective in reducing mania and in protecting against new mood episodes, but generally are not as effective in treating the depressions that bedevil people with bipolar disorder. The prognosis for people with mood disorders serious enough to need hospitalization is not particularly good. Our best studies suggest that 10% to 15% of these people will eventually commit suicide. Most people with serious unipolar depression and almost everyone with bipolar disorder will experience repeated episodes or chronic symptoms across their lives, even with adequate treatment. These episodes and symptoms frequently wreak havoc on occupational and social functioning. For reasons we are just now beginning to understand, mood disorders also take a terrible toll on health. People with mood disorders earlier in life are at increased risk later in life for many of the modern world's most lethal medical disorders. Some studies suggest people with bipolar disorder live almost 10 years less than people without mood disorders. Let me end this piece with a final comment regarding the specifics of Jesse Jackson Jr.'s treatment. The fact that he is in a ""residential facility"" has spawned a good deal of media discussion, most of it based around the fact that mood disorders are supposedly not treated in such facilities, but that substance abuse frequently is. I've heard pundits say that this means either that Jackson is actually in a psychiatric hospital and being euphemistic about his current accommodations or that he really is struggling with substance abuse and claiming a mood disorder as a way to avoid the stigma associated with drug and alcohol addictions. In fact, there are a number of high-end residential psychiatric facilities in the United States that do treat mood disorders, and -- in my experience -- do so very well for people who can afford a high price tag that is almost never covered by insurance. These facilities will frequently keep very ill patients for a month or more. So this one aspect of Jackson's story need not surprise or confuse us.","It is not known which mood disorder Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. may have .
Many with mood disorders only have depressions, which is called ""unipolar depression""
Others have ""bipolar depression,"" which includes manic episodes ."

"(CNN)  -- Inter Milan will learn their early group opponents as they begin their defense of the Champions League crown when the draw is made in Monaco on Thursday. Milan, who beat Bayern Munich in last May's final, are in the same top-seeded pot with the Germans. They are joined by British trio Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, Spanish giants Barcelona, city rivals AC Milan and French side Lyon. Inter could face Real Madrid, now managed by Jose Mourinho, who led them to their triple Serie A, Champions League, Italian Cup triumph last season before departing to the Bernabeu. Real are in the second pot as are Spanish rivals Valencia. Another potentially tricky hurdle might be English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur, who are in the third pot of eight. Tottenham qualified for the Champions League group stages with a thumping 4-0, aggregate 6-3 win, over Young Boys of Berne. Under Champions League rules they cannot face either of the other three English clubs at the first stage. Scottish champions Rangers are also in pot three, while the favorites will also want to avoid Portuguese side Braga, who put out La Liga's Sevilla in the result of the third qualifying round this week. Pot four contains the likes of Russian champions Rubin Kazan and Dutch title winners FC Twente. The 32 qualified teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams, with the top two from each group going through to the last 16 knockout stages. Each group will contain a top seed, plus one club each from the second, third and fourth pots. The opening set of group games will take place on September 14 and 15, with the final scheduled for England's famous Wembley stadium on May 28, 2011.","Champions League draw being made in Monaco on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- It will be a messy weekend in the Northeast and the Deep South as the massive weather system that walloped 20 states with a snowstorm rolls off toward the Atlantic Ocean. A winter storm is expected to deposit up to 10 inches of snow in isolated pockets of western Massachusetts, and 6 inches to a foot in parts of southern Vermont and New Hampshire, and central Maine. This is not the same storm that blanketed the Great Plains, said CNN Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri, although it is part of the same overall system that spans the country from north to south. It will be much less intense, he said, and it should not affect the places hardest hit by the blizzard that plastered the Northeast two weeks ago, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of customers. Boston will likely see a slushy mix of rain and snow that could lead to downed branches and power lines, Javaheri said. Track severe weather . Rain will continue to soak the eastern United States from Washington, D.C., on down, especially Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. ""Across the Southeast, some of the rainfall totals are going to be staggering,"" said CNN Meteorologist Karen McGinnis. Parts of the central Southeast should get 4 to 6 inches of rainfall. Some snow records . The outgoing system will have made its mark on virtually the entire country from the southwest corner of California to central Maine, leaving its deepest imprint on Kansas. Wichita saw its second-highest storm snowfall total on record with 14.2 inches over two days, the . said. The town of Russell in the state's middle lay under a 22 inch layer of white by the time the storm roared by. Missouri was not far behind, with accumulations of around a foot in some places. The snow set a record at Kansas City International Airport, with 9 inches falling in a single day. The old record was 5.1 inches set in 2010. Some businesses and universities shut down Thursday as state officials urged residents to stay off the roads. The white blanket emptied the streets of Kansas City. Silver lining . The snowstorm turned out to be a welcome one to many Kansans and many others throughout the Great Plains, who have been suffering a drought for a third straight year. Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and a host of other farm-heavy states have seen crop losses as a result. The Kansas Department of Agriculture expects those conditions to continue into April, but near-record levels of snowfall will ease the problem and could accelerate the drought's end. ""It snows so infrequently here. Now we've been in a really bad drought for several years; really, really hot summer and just no moisture. So we're thrilled to see snow or ice -- whatever moisture we can get,"" Wichita resident Kristen Woodburn said. Ranchers embraced the storm, even though bitter cold snow can be deadly during calving season. Frank Harper, a Kansas rancher from Sedgwick and the immediate past president of the Kansas Livestock Association, said the storm caused more work for him because he had to bring his calves inside to warm them up. But he called the snowstorm a blessing for bringing good moisture to the winter wheat.","The massive system sweeping the U.S. wraps up with a wet finale .

"(CNN) -- Rony Delgarde immigrated to the United States from Haiti with only $5 and a Bible. The first thing he saw when he landed at Miami International Airport were all the colorfully painted buildings. ""People paint their house yellow, white, red, blue and I said, 'Wow, there's so much paint in this country!'"" Delgarde says."" I said, 'When I get money in this country, I'm going to buy paint and take paint back home.'"" From that idea, Global Paint for Charity was born. Delgarde, who is 38 and works as a health care consultant, states the mission: ""to recycle leftover paint from businesses and residents, processes it and then donate it to vulnerable families in developing countries all around the world."" Delgarde explains the process for making paint in Haiti. ""We cut down trees and we started fire. We pick out rocks from the river and we put it inside the fire and close the fire for a week. And once it's done, it's a wonderful powder."" He points out that this type of paint washes away in the rain. Delgarde's nonprofit organization wants to make a lasting difference. Two years ago, Delgarde started going to construction sites in the Atlanta area, asking them what they did with their leftover paint. He told them, ""I want to collect your paint and take it someplace where people don't have access to paint. We'll give them paint and we'll change their lives. That's when I started collecting paint."" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that approximately 10% of the 637 million gallons of paint sold annually is left over, equal to about 64 million gallons per year. So far, Delgarde has donated 6,000 gallons of paint to projects in Kenya, Haiti and Uganda. He recently returned from Equatorial Guinea, where he donated 200 gallons of paint to an orphanage for children who lost their parent to HIV/AIDS. ""We looked at schools, hospitals, family homes and they were not painted. It really touched my heart to see the bacteria on the walls that were not painted. I said we have to do something,"" he says. Those looking to donate their leftover paint can visit the website of the group, GlobalPaints.Org, and fill out a request for a pickup. Ed Spencer, a consultant in Atlanta, says he donated his paint for several reasons. ""Recycling is number one and helping people is obviously number two. I think he's taken something very difficult for people to do correctly, that's recycling paint and created a way to do it and do it safely. And quite honestly, he's made it very inexpensive for people. It can be very expensive to get rid of large amounts of paint."" James Doherty, museum information specialist at the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum in Atlanta, was thrilled to be able to donate the museum's leftover paint to such a good cause. ""I was really excited to hear about Global Paint and the use for the paint in Third World nations because we have such a hard time getting rid of paint, and this kills two birds with one stone. It keeps the paint out of the landfills and it also goes to a good use,"" Spencer says. Although he has received phone calls from all around the country, Delgarde gets most of his paint donations from the Atlanta area. In addition to paint donations, Delgarde also receives monetary donations to help offset cost of shipping the paint. He doesn't do it alone either; he has a board of directors that consists of volunteer small business owners and government officials. After picking up the paint, Delgarde drives to one of three storage units. ""The other units are already completely full,"" he says. As he slides up the door to the unit, it's obvious; this one is almost full as well. ""We used to have a small warehouse where we would process the paint.

"(CNN) -- If I won an Oscar, I'd carry it around it with me everywhere. I'd start every conversation with, ""Well, as an Oscar winner..."" I'd wear a pin that says, ""Ask me about my Oscar."" I might even get a tattoo on my neck of the golden figurine. But that's just me. Because beyond the personal thrill of winning, the Oscars don't matter. The golden statue is increasingly becoming nothing more than a shiny paperweight. And I say this as someone who loves movies, appreciates the talented people who make them and has long watched the awards show. But in three categories the Academy Awards have lost their luster: the TV telecast, the box office impact of the awards on movies and their effect on people's acting careers. Are viewers particularly interested in watching the Oscars? Not so much. TV ratings show pretty clearly that percentage of people watching the Academy Awards has trended downward over the years. For example, in 2000, nearly 47% of the people watching TV on Oscar night watched the Academy Awards. It has not been that high since, and in 2012, the number had fallen to 34%. In fact, the 2012 Grammy awards had higher overall ratings than that year's Oscar telecast. Why? There's almost no surprise left. Viewers have a fairly good idea of who will win every big award after the parade of award shows that queue up in the weeks before the Oscars. There are so many! The Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Director's Guild, Producers Guild, the guys who run the deli by my apartment award show, etc. Oscar night feels more like a coronation than an actual awards show. The only Oscar surprise this year -- and it's not one that will help the TV ratings -- is the Academy voters' bizarre snub of Ben Affleck for a Best Director nomination for his film ""Argo."" Affleck won Best Director honors at this year's Golden Globes, as well as at the Director's Guild, SAG and Producer's Guild awards. He even won the best director prize at the British Academy Awards. Apparently, the Academy voters still won't forgive Affleck for the stinker ""Gigli."" Bergen: 'Zero Dark Thirty': Did torture really net bin Laden? In the category of how much does an Oscar help your film at the box office, the envelope says: Not much. Sure, there's an ""Oscar bump,"" but look at the 2009 Best Picture winner, ""The Hurt Locker."" It ended up grossing only $17 million in the United States. Keep in mind that $100 million in domestic box office receipts is generally considered a hit. $17 million is a bomb. Also last year's Oscar winner for Best Picture, ""The Artist,"" ended up earning approximately $45 million in U.S. theaters. No boffo hit there. Cullen: With 'Lincoln', a new frontier for Day-Lewis . And here's something that the Academy Awards hate to hear: Winning a Golden Globe has proven to be much more profitable for a movie than winning an Oscar. That is at least according to a recent analysis that looked at award-wining films over the past 12 years. Edmund Helmer, a statistician whose website, BoxOfficeQuant.com, analyzes film industry statistics found that movies that won an Academy Award had on average a $3 million bump in box office sales. However, Golden Globe winners saw on average a pop of $14 million. Pretty big dollar difference. And in the category of how much does an Oscar help your acting career, there's no denying it can help. But Oscar gold doesn't always translate into personal gold. Many talented actors and actress have won this coveted award only to find themselves with little film work a few years later. I'm talking Oscar winners like Mira Sorvino, Joe Pesci, Louis Gossett Jr. and Kim Basinger. Williams: Django, in chains . Perhaps the most glaring example of this is actress/comedian Mo'Nique, who won the 2009 Best Supporting Actress award for her role in ""Precious."" According to the Internet Movie Date Base (IMDb), her only movie since her Oscar triumph went straight to video. Conversely, there's a long list of amazingly talented actors and actresses who have yet to win an Oscar. A partial list includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Gary Oldman, Johnny Depp and Annette Benning. Obviously, Academy Awards organizers have little impact on some of these issues. But one change they can consider is moving the Oscars up to take place before the other award shows -- like states in the presidential primaries. At least then the Academy Awards will provide real drama as to winners and losers. Despite knowing the likely winners, I'm still looking forward to watching Sunday's Oscars. This year's host is the very funny Seth Macfarlane. Although I think the funniest moment of the awards' show may be when Russell Crowe sings a song from ""Les MisÃ©rables."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah would love an Oscar, but thinks they mostly don't matter in long run .

"(CNN) -- Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said Tuesday that it is liable for the San Bruno, California, pipeline rupture, which killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes in September 2010, and will compensate the victims. ""We are taking on financial responsibility so that everyone injured in the accident will be able to recover all of their damages from PG&E,"" said Chris Johns, the company's president. ""We are affirming our commitment to do the right thing in our response to this accident."" The announcement came in response to a San Mateo County Superior Court judge's request for PG&E's official position and ahead of a court hearing Friday on the case, PG&E said on its website. PG&E said it has been working to resolve claims ""fairly and promptly"" and to improve the safety of its pipeline operations. Federal officials said in August that a faulty pipe, flawed operations and inadequate government oversight led to the natural gas explosion in the San Francisco suburb. During a public board meeting after delivering their final report on the matter, National Transportation Safety Board investigators sharply criticized pipeline owner PG&E for the explosion, saying the pipe was inadequate from the time it was installed in 1956. That was compounded ""by a litany of failures"" over the years, including poor record-keeping, inadequate inspection programs and ""an integrity management program without integrity,"" NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said. ""It was not a question of if this pipeline would burst,"" she said. ""It was a question of when."" Hersman said the probe yielded ""troubling revelations about a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight, and government agencies that placed a blind trust in operators to the detriment of public safety."" In a memo sent Tuesday to employees, Johns noted that a legal filing in July had been interpreted by some to mean that the utility ""was leaving the door open to somehow blame San Bruno residents or the city of San Bruno for the accident itself. Nothing could be further from the truth, which we stated at the time. In a follow-up filing, we clarified our position by explicitly stating that none of the plaintiffs or residents of San Bruno was at fault for the accident. PG&E has consistently stated our position that we would do what we could to assist the residents of San Bruno and help them recover from this tragic accident."" He said external pressure had not led the company to issue the announcement. ""The judge is hopeful that this will make the legal proceedings move faster and more efficiently. PG&E is hopeful that this will allow the people injured to receive compensation sooner without unnecessary legal proceedings."" The September 9, 2010, explosion blasted a 72-foot by 26-foot crater and destroyed 38 homes in San Bruno, near San Francisco International Airport. A 28-foot segment of the pipe was found about 100 feet from the crater. Scorched homes and the shells of burned-out cars lined charred streets, where firefighters battled hot spots trying to save the devastated neighborhood. Prior to the hearing, the company said in a statement that it had taken ""multiple steps"" to improve the safety of its operations, including efforts to replace aging pipe and improve contacts with local police and fire departments. NTSB investigators determined the explosion was caused by a substandard and poorly welded pipe, creating a weak spot that resulted in a pipeline rupture during a pressure increase stemming from poorly planned electrical work. They said the faulty welds should have been detected when the pipe was laid in 1956. Compounding the problem, investigators said, was the fact that PG&E failed to alert emergency responders as soon as they realized the line had burst. Isolating the rupture to stop the flow of gas took more than an hour, and put first responders in a defensive mode as they struggled to put out the fire, investigators said. ""There were a lot of opportunities missed here by PG&E,"" Hersman said. During the board meeting, board member Robert Sumwalt noted that the California Public Utilities Commission failed to exercise adequate oversight and enforcement of PG&E, and that the federal regulator, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which is a part of the Department of Transportation, failed to monitor the state commission's oversight of PG&E. ""This accident is not just about the failure of a seam in a pipeline. Rather it's about a failure of an entire system -- a system of checks and balances that should have been put in place to prevent the disaster,"" Sumwalt said. Board members pointed to previous PG&E-related incidents as examples of the company's lax procedures, noting a gas explosion resulting in a fatality in 2008, and a gas main break in 1981 that forced more than 30,000 people to evacuate San Francisco's financial district. PG&E runs three major gas pipelines, including the one involved in the San Bruno explosion, under ""nine high-population-density neighborhoods in San Francisco,"" Herrera said.","NEW: PG&E president stresses that city of San Bruno nor residents were at fault .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong's highest court on Monday rejected the final appeal of two Filipino workers to gain permanent residency in Hong Kong, dealing a blow to thousands of foreign domestic helpers seeking to make the Chinese territory their permanent home. The Court of Final Appeal also rejected a request from the Hong Kong government to seek Beijing's clarification on a previous interpretation of the city's constitution regarding residency rights, in a case that had implications for the independence of Hong Kong's judiciary. Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma called any ruling on the request ""unnecessary"" given the court's decision on the application. Tens of thousands of domestic helpers -- mostly from the Philippines and Indonesia - often spend years, and sometimes decades, working and living in the homes of Chinese and foreigners living in Hong Kong. While other foreign workers can apply for permanent residency after spending seven consecutive years in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, domestic helpers are excluded from the law. Justice Ma wrote in his ruling that foreign domestic helpers are ""told from the outset that admission is not for the purposes of settlement."" The ruling was greeted with disappointment by campaigners. ""It's very unfortunate and it's sad but in a way it will make us stronger as it highlights the social exclusion that foreign domestic workers face in Hong Kong,"" said Cynthia Tellez, General Manager of the United Filipinos in Hong Kong. ""This really just reinforces this situation...that in terms of advocacy (for foreign domestic helpers) we need to do a lot more work."" Lawyers for Filipino maid, Evangeline Vallejos, had argued that immigration rules excluding foreign domestic helpers were unconstitutional and that helpers were entitled to the same treatment as professional expatriates. One of the lawyers, Mark Daly, said that they were ""very disappointed"" with the ruling but will continue to fight for the rights of foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong. ""We respect it (the judgment) but we think our arguments were stronger in the law and in principle,"" he said. ""We will keep fighting both inside and outside the court for human rights."" In 2011, The Court of First Instance came down in favor of Vallejos, ruling that the provision excluding domestic helpers should be struck down. But last year, the Court of Appeal's slammed the door shut again, stating that the Hong Kong legislature ""has a free hand in defining, refining, elaborating and adapting"" the Basic Law's expression of ""ordinarily resident,"" within certain limits. More than 117,000 maids would have been eligible for permanent residency if the appeal had been upheld. A total of about 292,000 foreign domestic workers live in the territory. Domestic helpers are a financial lifeline to their home countries -- remittances from Hong Kong to the Philippines exceeded $420 million in 2012, according to figures from the Philippines' central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. Studies show domestic helpers contribute billions to the Hong Kong economy in terms of childcare and care for the elderly. The decision by the Court of Final Appeals not to refer the case to Beijing for its ruling was welcomed by Hong Kong's legal community, many of whom had expressed concern that the request to send the issue to China for its decision undermined the court's independence. ""On this issue of referral the court has applied exactly the standards it has applied in the past and it reiterates the independence of Hong Kong's judiciary,"" Michael Davis, a lawyer from Hong Kong University said. The Hong Kong government's request for the court to seek Beijing's interpretation highlighted the sometimes difficult relationship between Hong Kong and China. Any ruling could have affected the status of children born in the city to mainland Chinese mothers whose husbands are non-Hong Kong residents. Under Hong Kong's constitution these children are granted the right of abode, and in recent years many Chinese mothers had been coming to Hong Kong to give birth. In January, the Hong Kong government issued a policy that bans Chinese mainland women with non-local husbands from booking public hospitals in Hong Kong to give birth.","Hong Kong's highest court rejects final appeal of Filipino workers to gain residency .

"(CNN) -- The Egyptian Football Association says it has reached an agreement with Bob Bradley for the former U.S. coach to take control of the north African country's soccer team. The 53-year-old will take over from Hassan Shahatah, who left the position after Egypt failed to qualify for the 2012 African Cup of Nations in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. ""We have chosen Bob Bradley to lead the national team after a lengthy negotiation with many foreign coaches,"" Egyptian FA president Sameer Zahir told CNN Arabic. ""We believe that Bradley is the most suited coach at this stage. ""We sent scans of the contract to him for review and comments and we expect to sign the contract officially with him here in Cairo in a couple of days."" Zahir said that Bradley will be paid $35,000 per month, a deal which he said suited both the coach and the Egyptian FA's budget. Bradley was sacked by U.S. Soccer in June, having led his team to the final of the Gold Cup earlier the same month. A year previously he took America to the last 16 of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He will be hoping to guide Egypt to the nation's first World Cup finals since 1990, with the next edition of the four-yearly tournament to take place in Brazil in 2014. After coaching at college level, Bradley earned his first big job with Major League Soccer side Chicago Fire, winning a domestic double in 1998 to be named coach of the year. He later moved to MetroStars in his home state of New Jersey and then Chivas USA of Los Angeles before winning the U.S. job in late 2006.","Former U.S. national soccer coach Bob Bradley accepts offer from Egyptian FA .

"(CNN) -- Investigators only recently were told that a natural gas pipeline that ruptured last year in San Bruno, California, killing eight people, had a leak more than 20 years before, federal officials said Wednesday. Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, made the disclosure during a visit to the blast site, where she announced new safety recommendations meant to address problems with emergency notification procedures. ""We are glad to see it,"" Hersman said of the document on the 1988 incident nine miles away from San Bruno, ""but we expected to see it sooner."" The information was discovered May 20 during a search of millions of documents by hundreds of employees, PG&E spokesman Brian Swanson told CNN. It was turned over to federal investigators immediately, he said. ""We acknowledged several times that our record-keeping practices are not where they should be,"" said Swanson, adding the utility has made improvements and will become an industry leader in making records available to assure the public it is operating safely. According to Swanson, the 1988 incident involved a ""trace"" leak. Crews replaced a 12-foot pipe section, he said. Hersman, who said the recent discovery of the PG&E document raises questions about its ability to conduct proper risk assessments, met Wednesday with several affected families. The massive explosion in the pipeline created a 72-foot long, 26-foot-wide crater, and residents of the San Francisco suburb originally thought an airliner had crashed there. A 28-foot pipe segment was found about 100 feet away from the crater. The blast and fire destroyed 38 homes. The NTSB expects to release its final report on the probable cause in the next few months. It made several recommendations in January, and announced three more Wednesday. It recommended PG&E employees call 911 when a possible pipeline rupture is suspected. The NTSB also said the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration should issue similar guidelines to other utilities and companies. And the board recommended PHMSA urge pipeline operators to provide emergency response agencies with details about their systems. PG&E welcomed the recommendations and has made improvements, Swanson said. Workers in the field are verifying records, making visual inspections and pressure-testing pipelines similar to the one that exploded September 9 in San Bruno, he said. In April, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced Monday that the Obama administration will push legislation designed to overhaul and upgrade America's aging oil and gas pipeline network. The initiative is partly a response to a series of deadly pipeline explosions, including the one in San Bruno. A February pipeline explosion in Allentown, Pennsylvania, resulted in the deaths of five people. San Bruno's faulty pipeline was installed in 1956; Allentown's was installed in 1928. LaHood called on the major pipeline companies to conduct a review of their oil and gas delivery systems to identify the lines with the highest risk. He also urged them to speed up the most critical repair work. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Federal investigators recently learned of 1988 leak .

"(CNN) -- A summer climbing expedition in the French Alps turned to tragedy early Thursday when a six-foot wall of snow came crashing down on two groups of climbers, leaving nine dead, French police said. Two people caught in the avalanche on the Mont Blanc massif were found alive in the snow afterward. Four others had been unaccounted for but later were found, police said. They had taken a different path on the mountain. Before the four were found, the search for them had been suspended just before 5 p.m. because of weather conditions, police said. Three people from Germany, three from Britain, two from Spain and one from Switzerland were killed, Haute-Savoie police said, but the nationalities of the missing are unknown. There were also French climbers in the party. Twelve people were injured, some of whom have already left the hospital because they had only minor injuries, police said. Police said a slab of snow and ice was thought to have triggered the avalanche but did not know what had dislodged it. Two groups of climbers were caught in the avalanche on the north side of Mont Maudit in the Mont Blanc range, near Chamonix on the French-Italian border, police said. A total of 28 climbers in the two groups were connected by ropes, said authorities in Annecy, France. Some of the climbers managed to get themselves back to their base at the Refuge des Cosmiques and raised the alarm. A mountain rescue unit was called out at 5:25 a.m. The route the climbers were taking up Mont Maudit is very popular with alpinists tackling the mighty Mont Blanc, said Alexis Hennebelle of Radio Mont Blanc. The climbers were very unlucky to be caught in such a catastrophic avalanche, he told CNN. Local newspaper Le Dauphine said it was the deadliest accident in the French Alps since 2003. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls visited Chamonix on Thursday afternoon to see the rescue efforts for himself. Speaking to reporters, he said the Mont Blanc range is, sadly, often the scene of dramas, but this is a particularly unfortunate incident. Valls paid tribute to the efforts of the emergency workers, French and Italian, who searched in perilous conditions of snow, ice and wind from the early morning for those who were missing. ""They've shown their professionalism, their sense of duty, to bring help in difficult conditions,"" he said. Valls said it was too soon to establish any responsibility for what had happened, and asked people to wait for the results of an investigation. Chamonix official Jean-Louis Verdier, who is responsible for mountain security, said there had been no clue Thursday morning that such a deadly avalanche might be unleashed. The climbers were on a steep slope where there was snow, which meant an avalanche was possible, but there was no reason to suspect it would happen then, he told CNN affiliate BFM TV. Bertrand Francois, of the Haute-Savoie police, told BFM the number of victims was a result of the high number of people in the area at this time of year. CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos said changes in temperature and heavy rainfall over the past week in the area may have created conditions in which sheets of ice like the one that fell are formed. According to the website pistehors.com, which recorded climbing deaths in the French Alps between 2003 and 2008, the number of deaths seen Thursday is unusual in a single incident. For the 2007-2008 season, there were 12 recorded avalanche deaths for climbers, eight of them in one accident. However, in the other years, the annual total for climbing deaths by avalanche ranged between one and five, according to its figures. Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in Western Europe, at nearly 15,800 feet. Mont Maudit, about 1,000 feet lower and the third-highest peak in the range, seems to have lived up to its name, which can be translated as ""hateful"" or ""cursed."" 4 climbers feared dead after Mount McKinley avalanche .

Police and witnesses said the fire broke out at Smart Fashions Limited at Mohammadpur, located in the inland city of Dhaka, and it quickly spread to a second floor where several hundred people, mostly women, were working. As the flames spread, panicked workers tried to head downstairs and outside to safety. But those that did get down found a door locked on the first floor, according to workers who escaped. ""There was no fire alarm in the factory, and everybody rushed to get out of the two-story building as some workers shouted they saw flames on the second floor,"" said Rezina Begum, one of those employees who suffered injuries. Saturday's fire comes two months after the country's worst clothing factory fire that killed 112 people at Tazreen Fashions Limited on the outskirts of Dhaka.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- President Barack Obama warned North Korea Sunday that if it moves forward with a planned test-firing of a long-range missile, it will further deepen its isolation, damage relations with its neighbors and face additional sanctions that have already strangled the country. ""North Korea will achieve nothing by threats or provocations,"" Obama said during a news conference in Seoul, South Korea, on the eve of an international nuclear security summit. ""North Korea knows its obligation."" Obama's strong words follow last week's announcement by North Korea that it is planning to carry out a rocket-powered satellite launch in April. The issue is overshadowing message of international cooperation for the summit, which is bringing together top officials from 54 countries including China and Russia. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said during the news conference that he considers the launch a direct violation of a U.N. Security Council resolution that bans the testing of the technology being used in the rocket-powered satellite. South Korea has said it considers the satellite launch an attempt to develop a nuclear-armed missile, while the United States has warned the move would jeopardize a food-aid agreement reached with Pyongyang in early March. ""Bad behavior will not be rewarded,"" Obama said. North Korea says it has a right to a peaceful space program and has invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch. A spokesman from the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea denounced the South for working to turn the summit ""into a platform for (an) international smear campaign"" against the North, according to North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). Pyongyang announced this month it would carry out a ""satellite launch"" in mid-April to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the country's founder. Using ballistic missile technology, however, is in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874 and against a deal struck with the United States earlier this month that it would not carry out nuclear or missile tests in return for food aid. In North Korea, a brutal choice . Pyongyang has said it will see any critical statement of its nuclear program as ""a declaration of war."" Prior to the news conference, Obama made his first visit to the demilitarized zone that splits the Korean peninsula. Obama peered through binoculars into North Korea where flags flew at half-staff to mark the 100-day anniversary of the death of Kim Jong Il. ""It's like you are in a time warp. It's like you are looking across 50 years into a country that has missed 40 or 50 years of progress,"" Obama said during the news conference. The president said the real consequence for North Korea, should it go through with the launch, is that the country's leaders will miss an opportunity ""to take a different path than the one they have been taking."" ""I hope that at some point the North Koreans make the decision that it is in their interests to figure out how to feed their people and improve their economy rather than have big parades where they show off weapons,"" Obama said. From propaganda to pop artist . The purpose of Obama's visit to the demilitarized zone was to meet with some of the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. ""When you think about the transformation that has taken place in South Korea during my lifetime, it is directly attributable to this long line of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen who were willing to create the space and the opportunity for freedom and prosperity,"" Obama told troops at a base near the DMZ. It was Obama's first trip to the demilitarized zone, though he has made two previous trips to South Korea as president. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton paid a visit to the area in 2010. Across the border on Sunday, North Koreans were mourning the death of Kim. Kim's son, who took over from his father following his death in December, and senior party officials visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang to observe a moment of silence, said North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The palace serves as the burial site for Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, and his son, Kim, who succeeded him as the country's ruler. Obama said he had not been able to assess the new leader of North Korea, saying ""It's not clear exactly who is calling the shots and what their long-term objectives are."" Seoul's nuclear summit will be the second after Obama hosted the first meeting in Washington in 2010. He initiated the biennial summit after presenting his vision of a nuclear-free world in Prague in April 2009. The official agenda will deal with nuclear terrorism and how to secure the world's nuclear material. Obama's visit comes virtually two years to the day after the sinking of the South Korean warship, the Cheonan, which left 46 sailors dead. South Korea says a North Korean torpedo attack was to blame for the ship's sinking. The North has denied the accusation.

"(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius, the South African amputee who is running in the 2012 Olympics on prosthetic legs, might be surprised to learn he is part of a history that traces back 3,500 years. Many ancient civilizations used prosthetic limbs made of wood and metal to get soldiers back into battle. They were also used for basic health reasons. For example, archaeologists have found two very old Egyptian artificial big toes that had been skillfully crafted. One toe was still fastened onto the right foot of the mummy of the daughter of an Egyptian priest, who may have suffered from diabetes. How good were the Egyptian prosthetics? Modern volunteers with similar amputations tried them on and reported the toes were both comfortable and highly efficient during walking. For most of history, prosthetic limbs were used primarily to restore function and secondarily to mimic the human form (one of the Egyptian toes even had a false toenail). In the 1980s, prosthetic limbs underwent a radical evolution when high-tech materials, sophisticated electronics, hydraulics and even microprocessor-controlled joints began appearing. Today, Pistorius' ""Cheetah"" legs are made of sophisticated curved composite carbon fiber that can handle fast running. There is no doubt that Pistorius, dubbed ""Blade Runner,"" is a world-class athlete. Born with missing fibulas, his legs were amputated below the knees as a baby. Pistorius holds the double-amputee world records for the 100-, 200- and 400-meter dashes, and he has performed well against able-bodied athletes in international competitions. He is also courageous and determined. In 2007, however, the International Association of Athletics Federations banned Pistorius from competing in able-bodied competitions after tests at the German Sport University showed the Cheetah blades allowed him to expend less energy than able-bodied runners. Pistorius assembled his own legal and scientific team and successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration in Sport. Further tests showed that Pistorius uses energy at the same rate as other elite runners, and that the Cheetah legs are not more efficient than human legs. Also, while his artificial limbs are lighter than human legs, he must push off the ground harder to get the same thrust, which cancels out any advantage. The International Association of Athletics Federations decision was overturned. However, the story is far from over. The ruling only applies to Pistorius, and right now there is no general decision nor any guidelines about the future use of what the court called ""adaptive sports equipment."" The issue will have to be revisited by each new athlete who wants to use artificial mechanisms in competition. What happens if one day prosthetic technology advances past the able-bodied athlete? The biophysicist Hugh Herr of MIT, himself a double amputee and one of the scientists who tested Pistorius, suggests that athletes will simply have to use less advanced technology to keep them on par with able-bodied athletes. But such a standard is clearly untenable. We do not ultimately know the degree to which technology mimics true physiological function. What if an amputee high jumper wants to use Cheetahs; what level of springiness is ""fair"" against able-bodied athletes? What about a swimmer who wants to use prosthetic hands or legs? Or an archer whose prosthetic arm does not tremble like an arm of flesh and blood? We do not have metrics that can determine true equivalence with able-bodied athletes. Then there is the issue of fairness. In this year's U.S. Olympic trials, Dathan Ritzenhein, the two-time Olympian and 5k American record holder, was eliminated from the marathon team because of leg cramps. Pistorius cannot get cramps in his calves because he does not have any, and so he can never be eliminated based on this criterion. The Pistorius case confronts us with two important questions. What is a disability? And what is the rationale for elite sport? Defining ""disability"" is a notoriously slippery enterprise. In 1997, Casey Martin, a professional golfer with a circulatory disorder, sued under the American with Disabilities Act to be allowed to use a golf cart to play in the U.S. Open. The PGA argued that walking the 72 holes while playing world-class golf was a significant factor in tournament play. Who determines what components of a sport are part of its competitive fabric? In the Martin case, it was the U.S. Supreme Court, who overruled the PGA and allowed Martin to use a golf cart. The world is not divided into the disabled and the able-bodied. ""Disability"" is a medical term, but it is also a legal and a social term; one can have a disability according to medicine but not law, or be considered disabled by social convention but not law or medicine. ""Normal"" refers to a range of functioning, and a good case can often be made that those at the lower end of the ""normal"" range have a disability. Where we draw the line can be arbitrary. What is the purpose of sport? Sport is an artificial world. The rules of a game, the distances we run, the criteria for inclusion are all made up, and we change them regularly. We can either have pitchers in professional baseball bat, as in the National League, or have a designated hitter as in the American League. Neither is ""right,"" no matter how passionately some feel about it. Sports work through convention. The great symbolic power of the Olympics is that we all agree on the same rules and then abide by them. Many opposed to Pistorius' inclusion in the Olympics argue that fair competition requires people who start with the same basic physiological equipment. Pistorius' supporters argue instead that fairness in sport means allowing all qualified people to compete, even those born without fibulas. Pistorius did not advance to the men's 400-meter final, but he is still an inspiration. The decision to let him compete in the Olympics is the beginning of this conundrum. More and more, our powerful technological achievements will butt heads with our sense of naturalness and fairness. A lot of the debate and controversy around biotechnology will be played out in athletic competitions. Let the games begin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Root Wolpe.","Oscar Pistorius is running in the 2012 Olympics on prosthetic legs .

"(CNN) -- A few thousand Egyptian fans will watch their national soccer team continue its bid to end a long World Cup wait on Tuesday, but coach Bob Bradley says that a population of 85 million are praying for victory. His ""Pharaohs"" will take on Zimbabwe knowing that a win will put the side five points clear of second-placed Guinea and well on the way to reaching the final round of African qualification for Brazil 2014. With the domestic league halted for a year after more than 70 fans were killed during a riot at a match last February, the American's task of lifting the continent's fallen soccer heavyweight has been fraught with problems on and off the pitch. Al Ahly, one of the clubs at the center of the Port Said tragedy, may have qualified for the Club World Cup by winning the continent's Champions League title last year against all the odds, but Egypt failed to reach the Africa Cup of Nations -- a tournament it has won a record seven times. The country's last World Cup finals appearance was in 1990. ""When I accepted this mission I knew how hard the challenge was for me,"" former U.S. team boss Bradley told the African Football Confederation's official website. ""Egypt is a big team, a champion in a transitional period where we are rebuilding the squad. Added to that is the current situation, and then came the Port Said incident and football activities were suspended. ""This made the mission even more difficult, but I never thought of abandoning it. All this stuff made me determined even more to achieve success with this team."" Zimbabwe has just one point from two Group G games, while Egypt has six -- and Bradley's mission was made easier when Guinea could only draw 0-0 with Mozambique on Sunday. ""When we faced Mozambique in match day one of the qualifiers behind closed doors, we felt as if we were not the home team,"" Bradley said. ""This time we'll have a few thousands in the stands and 85 million outside praying for us to win. If it was possible most of these millions would be there in the stands. All the Egyptians want to see their national team in the World Cup finals after a 24-year absence. ""After Zimbabwe we have two more games in June and everything could happen. But I believe winning on Tuesday will open the door for us to win this group and qualify to the final qualifying round. There are no margins for error in this match."" Bradley, who won over many doubters when he took an active interest in the Egyptian people's struggles and protests following his arrival in September 2011, believes his players can overcome their recent adversity -- especially now the domestic league has resumed. ""Those players are very strong, mentally and technically. Playing in the World Cup is the ultimate dream for all of them, either the young ones like Mohamed Salah and Mohamed El Nenny, or the veterans like Mohamed Abou Treika and Wael Gomaa who want to put the cherry on the top of their career by playing in the World Cup."" Defender Ahmed Elmohamady hopes the presence of supporters will spur his team to victory. ""Recently we played either away or behind closed doors and that affected us much. Our supporters' presence will be like magic and will motivate us to win this game,"" he said. ""I know only 30,000 fans can attend because of security measures, but still this is better than nothing. I hope to see 30,000 ones in full voice in the stands."" Meanwhile, Ethiopia edged closer to a first World Cup finals appearance after beating Botswana 1-0 on Sunday thanks to a late goal from substitute Getaneh Kebede. It returned Ethiopia to the top of Group A, having surrendered the position when South Africa won 2-0 against Central African Republic on Saturday. Tunisia earned a third successive victory in Group B, beating second-placed Sierra Leone 2-1 to move five points clear. Morocco's hopes of a fifth finals were hit by a 3-1 defeat against Tanzania, which allowed the home team to close to within a point of unbeaten Group C leader Ivory Coast after three matches. Zambia dropped its first points in Group D, being held 1-1 in Lesotho while second-placed Ghana closed to within a point with a 4-0 win at home to Sudan. Burkina Faso beat Niger 4-0 for its first win in Group E, where three teams all have three points but Congo leads the way with a 100% record following Saturday's 1-0 win over Gabon. African champion Nigeria was caught at the top of Group F on Saturday after snatching a 1-1 draw with Kenya, as Malawi also moved up to five points with a 1-0 win away to Namibia. Mali leads Group H by two points following Sunday's 2-1 win over bottom team Rwanda, while Libya's bid to overhaul Group I leader Cameroon was thwarted in a 0-0 draw away to Democratic Republic of Congo. Liberia closed to within a point of Group J leader Senegal with a 2-0 win at home to Uganda. Senegal drew 1-1 in Angola on Saturday in a match moved to Guinea due to crowd trouble in Dakar last year.","Egypt fans allowed to attend World Cup qualifier against Zimbabwe in Alexandria .

"Washington (CNN) -- Say goodbye to one of the greatest irritants of modern life: television commercials that are MUCH LOUDER THAN THE SHOW YOU ARE WATCHING! Beginning Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission is barring broadcasters and pay TV providers from airing excessively loud commercials, saying ads must maintain the ""same average volume"" as the programs they accompany. The move -- which undoubtedly will make many TV viewers happier, and save countless marriages -- addresses a problem that, regulators say, is almost as old as television itself. Loud commercials have been a leading source of complaints to the FCC since its consumer call center began reporting top complaints in 2002. Since January 2008, the FCC has received about 1,000 complaints and about 5,000 inquiries, the commission said. Congress mandated the change in the aptly named Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation, or CALM, Act in 2010. Last year, the FCC set a December 13, 2012, deadline for full compliance. Until now, the FCC says it didn't regulate the ""loudness"" of commercials mainly because it was difficult to craft rules. For one thing, loudness is subjective. So, for years, the commission advised customers to mute their TVs or lower the volume. The CALM Act bill had wide bipartisan support, passing the Senate unanimously and the House by a voice vote. Bill supporters Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-California, and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, and industry representatives plan an event in Washington on Thursday to mark the full implementation of the law. The FCC says it has granted two temporary waivers to the law: one to South Georgia Governmental Services Authority, a municipal cable system, because of financial hardship; and to WPFO in Waterville, Maine, which asked for a grant because it is relocating its facilities. Non-commercial television stations are exempt from the act. Political ads, however, must comply. The FCC will not monitor compliance, but instead will rely on consumer complaints to assist the commission to enforce the rule. Complaints can be filed by using the online complaint form, 2000G, at http://www.fcc.gov/complaints.","A new rule mandates that ads maintain the same volume as TV shows .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer is confident he can beat Novak Djokovic again if he meets the world No. 2 in the semifinals of a grand slam for the fourth time in a row at Wimbledon. The third seed ended Djokovic's 43-match winning run at the French Open two weeks ago, but failed to add to his record 16 major titles as he lost to top-ranked Rafael Nadal in the final. Federer is again in the same half of the draw as the Serbian as he seeks to equal Pete Sampras' leading seven Open Era crowns at the English grass-court event, where he opens his campaign against Kazakhstani debutant Mikhail Kukushkin next week. It will be the Swiss star's first match on grass since his shock quarterfinal defeat by Tomas Berdych at Wimbledon in 2010, as he pulled out of last week's warm-up tournament in Germany due to a groin problem suffered at Roland Garros. Holder Nadal faces American Russell in Wimbledon opener . ""The first time I hit here on Monday, very easily, like right away after 10 minutes, it feels so natural for me to play on grass. I hope that feeling is going to pay off by going deep and then hopefully winning the tournament here,"" Federer told the tournament's website on Saturday. ""I'm happy about my game, and I am happy it showed in Paris. I played a wonderful match against Novak, and also all the other matches before that were good. Obviously I come into this tournament very confident. ""I feel good about myself, about my body. I've recovered. The last week was vital for me to recover from my groin injury. I feel like I'm almost back at 100% again, which is a really good sign for Wimbledon."" Why Murray's Wimbledon mission is unlikely to succeed . Djokovic beat Federer on the way to winning the Australian Open in January, and also triumphed in the semifinals of the 2010 U.S. Open before losing at the same stage to his rival at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London. ""I didn't necessarily need to prove my point in Paris for my mind or for my confidence. I know I can beat Novak on any surface,"" Federer said. ""I've done that in the past. Just because he's on a great winning streak doesn't mean he's unbeatable. ""That was my mindset going into the match in Paris. I played really well. I was able to play well in the key moments. Here at Wimbledon anyway, I'm even more confident. I think I'm a better player than in Paris, so I expect myself to do really well here, even better maybe."" Federer said the world's top-four players had similar chances of winning the title at Wimbledon, where No. 4 Andy Murray is seeking to become the first British champion since Fred Perry in 1936. ""I think all four guys at the top right now feel very comfortable on grass. That's maybe something that's a bit different than maybe in the past, where maybe one of the top four guys wouldn't feel so comfortable on grass,"" he said. ""But this year it seems like all of us are, which is a good thing. Murray's game is very natural for this surface. I think Djokovic has always been great, but nothing extraordinary yet. But with the run he's on, obviously there's a lot of possibilities for him as well here.""","Six-time champion Roger Federer could face Novak Djokovic in Wimbledon semifinals .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki is looking to win her first grand slam crown. Maria Sharapova, one of her predecessors as the top women's tennis player, is returning to the scene of her breakthrough title. Both players are adamant that their biggest obstacles to success at Wimbledon this year will be the Williams sisters Serena and Venus. The Americans are back on the scene after varying but significant absences. Serena, a four-time champion at the English grass-court grand slam, is playing just her second tournament since winning last year's final -- her second triumph in a row in south-west London. Can Serena Williams succeed in her comeback bid? The 29-year-old has spent the past 12 months recovering from a freak foot injury, cutting it in a restaurant and then facing a near-death situation as blood clots formed in both lungs. Her return at Eastbourne last week ended in a second-round loss to Vera Zvonareva, who avenged her 2010 Wimbledon final defeat. Venus, a five-time Wimbledon champion, reached the quarterfinals in her first tournament since retiring hurt with a hip injury at January's Australian Open. Both sisters are predictably rusty, but are still among the bookmakers' favorites to reach the final on July 2 along with Sharapova, French Open champion Li Na and -- further down the list -- Wozniacki. Sharapova, who stunned Serena as a 17-year-old in the 2004 final, is wary of the Williams' vast experience at the tournament. ""They've been champions here for many years. They're obviously the ones to beat on grass,"" the Russian told reporters ahead of her bid to win a fourth grand slam title. ""They've been out for a while so it's definitely great to have them back."" Serena Williams 'back from death bed' Fifth seed Sharapova could meet Serena -- who is No. 7 despite her slip in the rankings -- again in the semifinals, though she may have to beat Wozniacki to get that far. The 20-year-old Dane is a former junior Wimbledon champion but has never made it past the fourth round in the senior ranks. ""We all know that the game of the girls is perfectly suited for the grass. It's good that they got a higher seeding than their rankings because no-one wants to play them in the early rounds,"" Wozniacki said of the Williams duo. ""I'm very happy that Serena's doing well again. I don't wish for anyone to be in that situation because it's scary. Serena and Venus are great girls, I have a good relationship with them."" Wozniacki begins her campaign against Spain's 107th-ranked Arantxa Parra Santonja, who has never made it past the second round at Wimbledon. ""I've had a good year and won five tournaments so far. I know I can play really well on grass. I've won Eastbourne before, I won the junior title. I know that I can play really good tennis."" Sharapova will open against compatriot Anna Chakvetadze, once ranked as high as fifth in the world after reaching the semifinals of the 2007 U.S. Open but now 50th as she seeks to rebuild her career. ""I'm playing a lot better. I played a lot of matches on clay, which I really wanted to do. One of the reasons I love the transition is because I feel like you learn so much about the game when you're on the clay courts,"" said this month's French Open semifinalist. ""This is one of the best parts of the year for me. It's one of the toughest transitions from clay to grass, but for me it's a lot of fun."" Seventh seed Serena has been handed a potentially tricky tie against Aravane Rezai of France, while 23rd seed Venus faces Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan in the other half of the draw. Meanwhile, Marion Bartoli boosted her hopes of a repeat of her 2007 Wimbledon exploits by winning her first grass-court title at Eastbourne on Saturday. The French world No. 9, beaten by Venus Williams in the final that year, defied an potentially worrying leg injury in cool, windy conditions to beat Czech fifth seed Petra Kvitova 6-1 4-6 7-5. Due to Friday's washout, they both played two matches as Bartoli beat Australian seventh seed Samantha Stosur 6-3 6-1 and Kvitova went through when Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova retired with a stomach injury while trailing 7-6 (11-9) 4-2. In the men's final, Italy's Andreas Seppi earned his first ATP Tour title as Serbian third seed Janko Tipsarevic retired hurt in fading light while trailing 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 3-5. Tipsarevic, the world No. 30, is in doubt for Wimbledon after injuring his groin, the UK Press Association reported. At the Dutch warm-up event in 'S-Hertogenbosch, Italian seventh seed Roberta Vinci claimed her fifth WTA Tour title and first on grass by beating former world No. 4 Jelena Dokic, 6-7 (7-9) 6-3 7-5 in Saturday's final. Now ranked 59th, Dokic will play French Open runner-up Francesca Schiavone in the first round at Wimbledon, where she reached the semifinals in 2000, while Vinci takes on Russia's Vera Dushevina. In the men's final, Russia's Dmitry Tursunov beat Croatian fourth seed Ivan Dodig 6-3 6-2 to claim his first title since Eastbourne last year.","Serena and Venus Williams are the players their female rivals hope to avoid at Wimbledon .

"(CNN) -- A man set himself on fire Tuesday outside the court in Norway's capital, Oslo, where Anders Behring Breivik is on trial over terrorist attacks last summer that killed 77 people. ""We don't know much about his motives, but he set himself alight outside the courthouse. Police were quick to put the fire out, and he has now been taken to hospital,"" Unni Groendal, head of media for Oslo police, told CNN. Police said in a statement released later Tuesday that the man was a Norwegian citizen from a foreign background. He has severe injuries, but they are not life-threatening, the statement said. He is expected to have surgery early Wednesday. ""It is still unclear what the motive was for his action. He can currently not be questioned by police,"" the statement reads. A police spokesman earlier dismissed reports that the man had tried to force his way through the cordon outside the district courthouse. Norwegian daily newspaper VG reported that several court employees ran out with water bottles to pour water over the man. Video posted on the VG website shows the man running toward the court building with his hat and jacket on fire. Police officers then pull off his clothing and try to extinguish the flames as he lies on the ground. He was given first aid treatment on site. The incident happened about 1:45 p.m. local time (7:45 a.m. ET), according to Norwegian TV channel TV2. Breivik is on trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the July 22 attacks. He admits carrying out an attack on a youth camp on Utoya Island and a bombing in Oslo that killed eight people. He boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway. Experts' assessment of Breivik's sanity will be a factor in determining what punishment he receives if convicted. Sentencing options could include imprisonment or confining him to a mental facility. Friday's court session was disrupted when the brother of one of those killed threw a shoe toward Breivik, hitting one of his defense lawyers. This week, the court is hearing testimony from some of those injured during Breivik's gun rampage on Utoya Island. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","NEW: The man is a Norwegian citizen with a foreign background, police say .

"(CNN) -- Football's latest match-fixing scandal could have implications far wider than Italy, where 17 people were arrested on Monday including former World Cup player Cristiano Doni. Doni had already been banned until 2014 by the Italian Football Federation in the first part of the ""Last Bet"" investigation earlier this year. The former Atalanta captain, whose club started this Serie A season with a six-point penalty due to his and a teammate's offenses, has now been suspected of trying to destroy evidence. Prosecutors told reporters that the arrests, which also included former players Luigi Sartor and Alessandro Zamperini plus Piacenza's Carlo Gervasoni and Spezia's Filippo Carobbio, were ""a starting point in cleaning up the beautiful game that is football."" Italian football journalist Tancredi Palmeri told CNN that investigators had found links to people outside the country -- in Asia, South America and other parts of Europe. ""This one can be bigger. This time investigators found a link between the single players in the team and someone abroad -- they talk about Singapore, where we know there was already some suspicion of crime connected with illegal betting,"" Palmeri said on Monday. ""This can also involve other leagues, not only Italian. Investigators said they will investigate Italian football because they are Italian investigators. ""They know for sure there are games in Argentina and Bolivia involved, and they suspect other European leagues including German leagues and French leagues."" European football's governing body UEFA has already had to deal with betting scandals in Eastern Europe and Turkey this year. This is the latest in a series of investigations affecting Italy. Juventus lost two league titles in 2006 due to the ""Calciopoli"" affair, which saw the Turin side relegated to Serie B after being accused of rigging games by arranging ""favorable"" match officials and also implicated AC Milan, Fiorentina, Lazio, and Reggina. Doni, 38, was banned in August along with clubmate Thomas Manfredini and fellow former Italy international Giuseppe Signori, but all have denied any wrongdoing. Palmeri said it was likely that clubs are also involved, not just players -- one of who claimed such activities had been going on for a decade, according to prosecutors. ""Everything is connected with the fact that if single players are connected or clubs are connected,"" Palmeri said. ""Last time, Calciopoli, that was football institutions and the clubs. This time, as we saw already in summer, it's so far just single players trying to make money giving connections and trying to fix the games through the contacts they have in football."" Prosecutor Roberto Di Martino revealed the extent of outside involvement. ""At the top of this organization are men from Singapore, who are those who move the money, but the shareholders are divided from the West, to the Far East, to South America, and they manage with their men how to change the outcome of football matches,"" he told the Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper. Meanwhile, former Atalanta coach Bartolo Mutti has been appointed as boss of Palermo for the second time after Devis Mangia was sacked on Monday. Mangia took charge of the Serie A side on a temporary basis at the end of August in his first major coaching role, and signed a two-year contract last month. But Sunday's 2-0 defeat by Sicilian rivals Catania left Palermo 10th in the table, and the 37-year-old became the ninth coaching casualty in Serie this season. Mutti, 57, coached Palermo in 2001-02 when the club languished in the second division. His last two jobs ended in relegation after taking over at Atalanta and Bari in the latter parts of the season.","Italian prosecutors find links to Asia, South America and other parts of Europe .

"(CNN) -- T.J. Lane didn't belong to any particular clique in the schools he attended, fellow students said. Those who knew him described him as quiet, someone who was guarded and rarely spoke about his tumultuous family life. But they never would have thought that he'd be described as a killer -- until Monday, when students say they saw Lane walk up to a table in the cafeteria of Ohio's Chardon High School with a gun. Police have not named the alleged gunman, a juvenile, but many witnesses have identified the attacker as Lane. One victim died Monday. Two others were declared dead on Tuesday. One other remained hospitalized Tuesday. A fifth victim was released, officials said. Lane made an initial juvenile court appearance Tuesday afternoon, during which he was ordered to remain in custody. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said Tuesday that the suspect would likely be tried as an adult. Prosecutor David Joyce predicted that the 17-year-old sophomore will face three counts of aggravated murder ""as well as other counts."" He said Lane has admitted taking a .22-caliber gun and a knife into Chardon High School on Monday morning and firing 10 rounds, choosing his victims randomly. All Chardon schools closed Tuesday; counselors on hand . Teresa Hunt said her niece rode the school bus each day with Lane, and he displayed no warning signs of the violence allegedly to come. ""He was a really nice kid to her,"" Hunt said. ""He wouldn't start up a conversation, but if she talked to him, he would hold the conversation with her. She said her niece noted no personality changes in Lane in the weeks leading up to Monday's shooting. Haley Kovacik, a friend who talked with Lane a few times a week, said the violence left her and others who knew him in ""complete shock."" ""He seemed like a very normal, just teenage boy,"" Kovacik said of Lane. ""He did have a sad look in his eyes a lot of the time, but he talked normally, he never said anything strange."" Yet for all their talks, Kovacik noted there was a lot she didn't know about Lane. Lane lived with his grandparents and was slow to open up about his personal life, according to friends. While he was known by many around Chardon High School, located 30 miles east of Cleveland, at the time of the shooting he was there to be transported to Lake Academy Alternative School in nearby Willoughby. The school describes itself as a place for ""at risk"" students who are ""reluctant learners"" struggling with problems such as ""substance abuse /chemical dependency, anger issues, mental health issues, truancy, delinquency, difficulties with attention/organization, and academic deficiencies."" Lane may have been dealing with his own family problems, according to reports by The Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland. Lane's father, Thomas Lane Jr., has been arrested several times for violent crimes against female acquaintances, including Lane's mother, the newspaper reported citing court documents. Between 1995 and 1997, the first two years of Lane's life, his father and his mother were both arrested for domestic violence against each other, the paper reported. His father also served prison time for assaulting a police officer and he also was charged with holding a different woman under running water and bashing her head into a wall, the newspaper reported. It was unclear how much contact Lane had with his father. He rarely opened up about his family, some said. ""I've asked him once or twice, but he never would go into detail. He just said he had family trouble,"" Kovacik said . Evan Erasmus, who said his family knew Lane's family, was among several students who said what happened Monday took them totally by surprise. ""I was really shocked when I found out it was him,"" Erasmus said. ""He was quiet, but was one of the nicest kids there. You could talk to him really easily. He was funny."" According to Kovacik, Lane told her that ""he enjoyed hunting, he enjoyed video games, just normal things."" ""Everybody was in disbelief. Nobody could believe that T.J. (shot the students),"" Kovacik said. Recent posts on Lane's Facebook page show him sharing links to music videos from groups like Grimes and Blood on the Dance Floor, listing his sister in his profile and uploading photos of himself. Yet one long, poetic rant, from December 30, appears to be darker. The post refers to ""a quaint lonely town, (where there) sits a man with a frown (who) longed for only one thing, the world to bow at his feet."" ""He was better than the rest, all those ones he detests, within their castles, so vain,"" he wrote. Lane then writes about going through ""the castle ... like an ominous breeze through the trees,"" past guards -- all leading up to the post's dramatic conclusion. ""Feel death, not just mocking you. Not just stalking you but inside of you,"" he writes. ""Wriggle and writhe. Feel smaller beneath my might. Seizure in the Pestilence that is my scythe. Die, all of you."" After getting three positive reviews, Lane wrote: ""much obliged to all who 'liked' this. Wrote it myself in class one day ..."" CNN's Martin Savidge and Lisa Sylvester contributed to this report.","The motive behind the shooting remains unclear, police chief says .

"(CNN) -- Napoli won the Italian Cup final 2-0 on Sunday to shatter Juventus' hopes of a domestic double and ruin Alessandro del Piero's final game for the Old Lady. Second-half goals by Edinson Cavani and Marek Hamsik gave Napoli their first Italian Cup win since 1987 when Diego Maradona led the team in an unprecedented period of success for the club. After winning Serie A and going unbeaten through the season, Juventus were aiming for a first domestic double since 1995. ""It's almost unthinkable to beat Juventus over 90 minutes when they hadn't lost all season. It was an achievement within an achievement,"" Napoli coach Walter Mazzarri said. Juve coach Antonio Conte named Del Piero in his starting lineup at Rome's Stadio Olimpico, despite fielding the forward only sparingly for the rest of the season. It was a decision that ultimately backfired. With Juve trailing 1-0 and struggling to create chances, the 37-year-old came off to warm applause to be replaced by Simone Pepe, who five minutes later came close to fashioning an equalizer only for his deflected effort to be kept our by the legs of goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis. Napoli had gone ahead in the 62nd minute when Ezequiel Lavezzi won a penalty after goalkeeper Marco Storari's foul and Cavani converted. Hamsik made sure of a deserved win when he finished off a swift counter attack with seven minutes remaining. Juve substitute Fabio Quagliarella was sent off in the 90th minute for elbowing Aronica to complete a miserable day for the Turin club. After the celebrations die down, Napoli will turn their attentions to trying to keep hold of star players like Cavani, Hamsik and Ezequiel Lavezzi, who have all been linked with big-money moves away from the club. In France, Montpellier won the Ligue Un title for the first time in their history - leaving big-spending Paris Saint-Germain to settle for second. Montpellier only needed a draw but John Utaka scored twice to give them a 2-1 win at bottom club Auxerre, whose home fans twice held up the game by throwing tennis balls, toilet rolls and flares onto the pitch. PSG won 2-1 at Lorient but Montpellier's result made the result irrelevant. The southern club finished three points ahead of PSG, who failed to win the title despite having a budget to dwarf all of their rivals. Since the club was taken over by Qatari owners last year, PSG have broken the French transfer record to buy Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore for â‚¬43 million, employed Brazilian Leonardo as sports director and brought in Carlo Ancelotti as coach. Elsewhere in France, Dijon and Caen joined Auxerre in dropping out of the top flight and Eden Hazard scored a hat-trick in his final game for Lille -- a 4-1 win over Nancy. Hazard is set to move to England, but did not reveal which club.","Napoli beat Juventus 2-0 win win Italian Cup for first time since 1987 .

"New York (CNN) -- A federal judge has blocked New York City from acquiring footage produced by documentary filmmaker Ken Burns about a 1989 rape case concerning five wrongfully convicted men. U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald L. Ellis ruled Tuesday that the city had not shown enough reason to trump press freedoms when it requested interviews and unreleased footage from the Burns' film ""The Central Park Five."" The men have since been exonerated. The city had asked for the footage as part of an attempt to defend itself against a decade-long, multimillion-dollar federal lawsuit the men have since filed in the racially charged case. Lawyers for New York City filed a subpoena demanding that Burns and his production company, Florentine Films, give them the unpublished interviews and unreleased footage not used in the documentary, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2012. ""While journalistic privilege under the law is very important, we firmly believe it did not apply here. It is our view that we should be able to view the complete interviews, not just those portions that the filmmakers chose to include,"" city attorney Celeste Koeleveld said. Burns, his daughter, Sarah Burns, her husband David McMahon, who co-wrote and produced the film, along with their production company, fought the subpoena primarily on the ground that the city's argument was not strong enough to trump reporter's privilege codified in the New York Shield Law, which protects journalists and their sources. In a statement, Burns said, ""David McMahon, Sarah Burns and I are grateful for this important decision; we feel the judge made exactly the right ruling. We are also mindful that this ruling goes far beyond our current situation; this adds a layer of important protection to journalists and filmmakers everywhere."" On April 19, 1989, a 28-year-old white Wall Street investment banker was jogging through Central Park when she was brutally assaulted, raped and left for dead. That same night a group of black and Latino boys had been in the park, throwing rocks at cars. In the ensuing months, the investigation lead to the arrest of five of the boys -- Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kharey Wise and Kevin Richardson -- who were later charged and convicted. In 2002, three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms, one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when Matias Reyes, a serial rapist and murderer, confessed to the crime and said he had acted alone. DNA analysis later determined that Reyes did rape the jogger and that hair evidence used in the boys' trials did not match.","U.S. magistrate judge rules city had not shown enough reason to trump press freedoms .

"(CNN) -- In the winter of 2011, Chris, a 23-year old professional poker player, was confident that his candidate, President Barack Obama, would keep control of the White House in November of 2012. But instead of ordering a few lawn signs or volunteering to go door-to-door for the campaign, he put his money where his mouth was. Chris, who asked that his last name not be used out of legal concerns, bet a Maryland bookie $50,000 that Obama would beat the field, at that time the entire cohort of Republicans slugging it out in the primary. ""I was very confident,"" said Chris, a recent graduate of George Washington University. ""No outcome is certain, but this guy was offering me 50-50 and I didn't understand how I can turn this down. The president, at the very least, was a favorite."" It is illegal to vote on the election in the United States -- the Maryland Attorney General's office told CNN that instances of betting on an election are rare -- but that doesn't mean betting on an election elsewhere is rare. Just look across the Atlantic, where most betting institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland have odds on all things presidential. By the numbers: Presidential predictions . International odds makers are giving the upper hand to Obama. Most UK bookmakers this week, aside from a few outliers, give Obama 1 to 4 odds (if you bet $1 and win, you get $1.25 back), while Romney is getting 11 to 4 odds (for every $4 you bet, you get $11 back). Paddy Power, a popular Irish bookmaker, is one such company. They not only offer head-to-head betting opportunities, but they also allow bettors to wager on state-by-state winners, Electoral College numbers and even the odds that Romney and Obama will tie in the Electoral College (only 25/1 at time of publishing). By the way, there are also odds on who would win the 2016 presidential election. Mitt Romney is the favorite, Paul Ryan, Romney's running mate, is a close second and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is just behind Ryan. Donald Trump, the Republican business magnate, is getting 100 to 1 odds. Obama getting better odds . Paddy Power, like most international bookmakers, has Obama as the favorite and Romney as the underdog in Tuesday's election. In the last few days, possibly looking to take advantage of the odds, a sizable amount of money has been coming in for Romney, according to FÃ©ilim Mac An Iomaire, a spokesperson for Paddy Power. ""It is over a million pounds sterling (about $1.6 million) at this stage,"" Iomaire says of the amount of money that has been bet so far. Everyday, he says, bets of over 10,000 pounds -- or about $16,000 -- have become normal. In order to set the odds, Iomarie says a group of bookies in Ireland comb through much of the same data that American political watchers read. ""All the latest polls will be looked at. We also do a line in all the states -- so we watch the regional polls very closely,"" Iomarie said. ""Ninety percent of it going in is what the polls are saying."" My Take: I've got my money on the Church of Nate Silver . Intrade is another popular Irish site that allows members to bet on the outcomes of non-sports-related events. Members buy ""contracts"" that stipulate what they are worth if whatever outcomes happens. For example, at time of publishing, buying one share of ""Barack Obama to be re-elected President in 2012"" would cost $6.65. By contrast, the same bets for Romney cost $3.38. According to Intrade, Obama has a 66.3% chance of winning the election. Romney has a 33.9% chance. Intrade has become a website the political reporters and pundits follow regularly. When Obama's chance of winning on Intrade began to slip, many Republicans took to Twitter to tout the downslide. Like most betting sites, Intrade does not allow U.S. credit or debit cards to be used on the site -- a way to basically prohibit Americans from betting on the election. Brit: Americans are too 'emotional' Back at Paddy Power, Iomaire jokes that Americans may not be the best people to bet on their own election. ""I know from speaking to American friends, they tend to have a bit more of an emotional opinion about it,"" Iomaire said with a laugh. ""When we are looking at it on our end, we are setting it very much based on polls and the money that is coming in."" The people betting, like Chris, see it differently, though. ""Given how little is known by non-political scientists about how elections are determined, almost no one has a good idea about the likelihood about one person winning or not,"" Chris said. When you look at election forecasting models that ""rely on more economic data and less on polls, the percentage likelihood exceeds the odds that any sports book is giving."" Biden does Letterman's Top 10 . One blog the avid bettor reads, he says, is The Monkey Cage, a blog about political science and politics. John Sides, a contributor to the blog and a professor at George Washington University, says he never saw himself as a prognosticator. ""I never thought of myself as giving a lot of sage advice that then you could make wagers on,"" Sides says. But in saying that, he acknowledges that understanding the data and the historical trend of economic data can lead to ""educated guessing."" ""To the large extent, the inclination of academics is to look at systematic patterns in the past and derive what is going to happen in the future,"" Sides said. ""Maybe the information is useful, but then again, that perspective opens up the risk that this time is different. ""It would be easy money if the election weren't close. But it is a very close election,"" he said. Bettors like Chris remain strident, though. ""It is a market that is malformed,"" Chris said. ""Whenever there is a malformed market and you know what you are doing, it is a reasonably good place to put your money.","International sites take wagers on who will win the election .
It is illegal, however, to make such bets in the U.S.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- It reads like a palate-pleasing menu. You start out with a truffle soup, followed by oysters and then a main course of flounder with risotto and vegetables. There's a side of potatoes and you finish it off with a scoop of ice cream. Here's the twist -- this all comes with a generous helping of dirt. Not normal, backyard variety dirt, special nutrient-rich soil. The unique tasting menu is the creation of Toshio Tanabe, a former gymnast and boxer turned culinary inventor. Tanabe says the dirt menu was a logical addition for his quaint restaurant, Ne Quittez Pas, which is located in Tokyo's Gotanda neighborhood. ""This is a seafood restaurant, so we have the flavors from the ocean,"" he says. ""I was also looking for flavors from the earth."" The best sushi restaurants in Tokyo . But this is not the typical dirt you'd find it your backyard. It comes from a garden wholesaler, which provides the high quality soil, taken deep beneath the earth's surface -- 10 meters down, in fact. Germaphobes can take some comfort, perhaps. Tanabe tells us the soil is first lab tested, and then heated to extreme temperatures, to kill off any bacteria. After that process is complete Tanabe will work it into his menu. This special fare is certainly not dirt cheap. The set course is about US$110 per person. And how does it taste? According to one adventurous eater, who wished to remain anonymous the night of our visit, ""I didn't think it would be real dirt. I was a bit nervous. But it was a subtle taste.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The court battle may finally be over, but there is still a great mystery hanging over the next America's Cup event: What will the holders use to defend the trophy? America's Cup team Oracle has trialed a trimaran which it revealed in September 2008 . Established in 1851, the America's Cup is the oldest active trophy of any sport and by far the most prestigious match race sailing event in the world. Scheduled for February 2010, the 33rd edition of the America's Cup will be contested by the holders -- Swiss syndicate Alinghi, and U.S. challenger Oracle, owned by Larry Ellison. The date follows protracted court battles which saw both teams fighting over the terms of the next event. Last month's New York Supreme Court ruling which finally decided the terms and date of the regatta also announced that the contest is to be decided in a one-off series in multihull boats. While Oracle revealed a 90 ft trimaran last year, defenders Alinghi are still building their boat for the event -- and they are refusing to give away any secrets about it. CNN's MainSail show visited the Alinghi base in Switzerland to try to catch a glimpse of the mystery vessel -- but they came no closer to seeing the boat under construction. MainSail presenter Shirley Robertson only got as far as the compound gates in her quest to see the vessel. Watch video of CNN visiting the Alinghi team base »  The team's design co-coordinator, Grant Simms, told CNN that the design would not be revealed until the latest possible point. ""It's quite unusual and we are trying to keep it a secret as long as we can. ""We are hoping to stop our opponents from seeing it and reacting to it,"" he said. The design of the boat is generally a crucial part of any America's Cup regatta -- and none more so than this one, where a different type of boat is being introduced. Also, the size and shape of the boat could indicate where the regatta may be held -- something that doesn't need to be announced by defenders Alinghi until six months before it is set to begin. The cup holders can set the terms of the next defense, in conjunction with the ""challenger of record"" -- whichever team signs up as the first challenger. This is important as different locations can have a wide variety of wind strengths and sea swells, which can suit varying sizes of boat and types of sail. You can watch this month's MainSail show in full on CNN International or on the MainSail Web site from Thursday 18th June.","Next America's Cup to be decided between Alinghi and Oracle in February .

"GENEVA, Switzerland (Reuters)  -- Extreme sexual violence against women is pervasive in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and local authorities do little to stop it or prosecute those responsible, a U.N. investigator said on Monday. A woman struggles to describe her rape by military members. Health workers call rape an epidemic. Rape and brutality against women and girls are ""rampant and committed by non-state armed groups, the Armed Forces of the DRC, the National Congolese Police, and increasingly also by civilians"", said Turkish lawyer Yakin Erturk. ""Violence against women seems to be perceived by large sectors of society to be normal,"" she added in a report after an 11-day trip to the strife-torn country. Erturk, special rapporteur for the United Nations Human Rights Council on violence against women, said the situation in South Kivu province, where rebels from neighboring Rwanda operate, was the worst she had ever encountered. The atrocities perpetrated there by armed groups, some of whom seemed to have been involved in the 1994 Rwandan massacres in which 800,000 people were killed, ""are of an unimaginable brutality that goes far beyond rape,"" she said. ""Women are gang-raped, often in front of their families and communities. In numerous cases, male relatives are forced at gun point to rape their own daughters, mothers or sisters,"" she said. After rape, many women were shot or stabbed in the genital area, and survivors told Erturk that while held as slaves by the gangs they had been forced to eat excrement or the flesh of their murdered relatives. Women who have been raped are systematically rejected by their families and society. Widespread sexual abuse in the various conflicts racking the republic -- which last year held elections hailed as marking a new era -- ""seems to have become a generalized aspect of the overall oppression of women,"" Erturk said. Her report followed charges from U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour last week that soldiers and police used excessive force, including summary executions, in quelling opposition protesters in the west of the DRC earlier this year. In the central Equateur province, the police and army often responded to civil unrest ""with organized armed reprisals that target the civilian population and involve indiscriminate pillage, torture and mass rape"", the report found. Although the DRC parliament outlawed sexual violence in July 2006, ""little action is taken by the authorities to implement the law and perpetrators continue to enjoy immunity, especially if they wear the state's uniform,"" Erturk said. Erturk said Congo's justice system was corrupt and in ""a deplorable state,"" while conditions in prisons were ""scandalous"". Senior army and police officers shielded their men from prosecution, and when some were arrested they escaped easily, probably ""with the complicity of those in charge."" In a few cases courts had ordered the state and individuals to compensate victims. But ""to this day the government has not paid reparations to a single victim who has suffered sexual violence at the hand of state agents,"" said  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- An upstate New York mother is accused of hiring strippers for her son's 16th birthday party late last year, according to the Saratoga County District Attorney. Judy Viger, 33, of Gansevoort is charged with five counts of endangering the welfare of a child, District Attorney James Murphy said in a statement. The parents of five teens who attended the party reported the presence of strippers to police. The complaining parents found out that the strippers had been at the November 3 bowling party through photos posted on Facebook. The parents took the pictures to the South Glens Falls police, who then started taking witness statements, the district attorney's statement says. One of the photos distributed by the district attorney's office shows Viger receiving a lap dance from one of the hired dancers; another picture shows a young male with another nearly nude dancer on top of him with her legs around his head. ""As difficult as it may be for us to have to weigh in on these kinds of cases, certainly exposing the unsuspecting children to this sort of 'entertainment' goes beyond the pale when it comes to what is appropriate for 14, 15 and 16 year old child,"" Murphy said in the statement. CNN affiliate WRGB visited the Viger home and encountered a man who said the family ""was not making statements at this time.""

"(CNN) -- Could it get any worse for Boeing? Its entire fleet of 787 Dreamliners - the most technologically advanced airliner in the world - has been grounded over the risk of a battery catching fire in flight. That followed a series of incidents in the last few weeks affecting high-profile early customers of its ground-breaking widebody - Japanese airlines ANA and JAL, United Airlines and Qatar Airways. After just over a year in service, and with a backlog of around 800 orders, the Dreamliner programme -- already delayed almost three years before it began flying passengers in late 2011 -- is again in stasis. Carriers forced to withdraw their Dreamliners from service will demand recompense, while others due to take delivery in the next few months will be frantically making alternative plans. Q&A: Dreamliner woes explained . With Boeing vowing to throw all its engineering resources at solving the problem over the next few weeks, it will mean other important projects being sidelined. And while a production line geared to turning out dozens of airliners a year cannot be simply be switched off, executives will be wondering whether it makes sense to continue producing aircraft that are currently grounded around the world. Yet, believe it or not, Boeing bosses may be breathing a sigh of relief that things have turned out as well as they have. The U.S. company's share price has held up, and while the unprecedented grounding of its entire fleet of 50 Dreamliners -- the first time an in-service type has been taken out of action since the late 1970s -- is damaging to Boeing's image and finances, it may not be catastrophic. Much depends on what the investigators find. The best scenario for Boeing is that the problem -- centered on two powerful lithium-ion polymer batteries -- is isolated. If regulators are convinced that a fix of the way the batteries are built or installed is sufficient -- and that measures are in place to minimize any risks from an overheated battery -- the 787 could be back in service within weeks. The battery that grounded Boeing . A much worse case is that the malaise spreads to the entire electrical architecture of the Dreamliner, forcing a back-to-the-drawing-board rethink of Boeing's design philosophy. This might take the aircraft out of service for a year or more, and would bring the airframer close to financial meltdown as it battled with a crisis much worse than the delay it experienced getting the 787 to certification. This, however, is extremely unlikely. While Boeing took a gamble in creating an aircraft so dependent on electrical systems and composite aerostructures, it has already gone through the lengthy and painful process of convincing regulators the Dreamliner is safe. That the authorities signed off on an aircraft with such a fundamental design flaw is close to inconceivable. As for the other incidents that have beset the type over the past few months -- a fan shaft failure on an engine, an oil leak, a windshield crack -- all can safely be put down to teething problems. Most new aircraft experience issues of this sort, an inevitable consequence of a test program becoming a production aircraft and the sheer complexity of modern airliner design. 7 elements that make the Dreamliner special . The A380, the superjumbo from Boeing's arch-rival Airbus, has had its own travails, both pre-certification, when the whole wiring infrastructure was called into question, and after service-entry when cracks were discovered in wing ribs. It would be astonishing if the 787's closest competitor, the Airbus A350 XWB, due to go into service next year, does not suffer its own bedding-in challenges. And, indeed, while you might imagine that executives in the French city of Toulouse, where Airbus is based, are relishing their opponent's travails, that is almost certainly not the case. In an industry rightly obsessed with safety, it is in nobody's interest to imply -- even subtly -- that another's product comes with any risk to passengers. Speed, economy, style, range, capacity: all may be product differentiators. But never, never safety. Besides, Airbus too has staked its reputation on lithium-ion technology. The A350, like the 787, will use these advanced batteries to power systems such as its auxilliary power unit. As so often in this duopolistic industry, one manufacturer's technological step-change is followed by its rival. Airbus remains convinced that its lithium-ion battery architecture will deliver operational economies. The grounding of the 787 fleet illustrates not the flaws in Boeing's industrial culture -- a rush to bring the airliner to market, a degree of over-innovation or a desire to please shareholders by outsourcing too much design and production -- but the rigor of a regulatory regime with a zero tolerance of any mote of imperfection. And, for anyone who flies, that is good to know. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Murdo Morrison.","Boeing's entire fleet of 787 Dreamliners has been grounded over a battery fire risk .

"Washington (CNN) -- Lithium-ion batteries, under global scrutiny following Boeing 787 Dreamliner fires, likely have a future in aviation provided there are adequate safeguards, a top U.S. safety advocate said on Wednesday. ""I would not want to categorically say that these batteries are not safe. Any new technology, any new design, there are going to be some inherent risks,"" Deborah Hersman, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said in Washington. Hersman added that the agency, which investigates transportation accidents and other incidents, is still ""several weeks away"" from determining electrical problems that have grounded the Dreamliner worldwide in recent weeks. Her investigators are specifically looking at a fire in early January that destroyed one of the two powerful batteries embedded in the belly of a Dreamliner while the plane was on the ground in Boston. ""We need to understand why (the Boston fire) happened and we need to make sure that in future installations that those risks are mitigated,"" she said. Another battery-related incident that forced an emergency landing of a Dreamliner several days after the Boston incident is part of the investigation that also includes the Federal Aviation Administration, Japanese regulators and Boeing. Although there are only 50 Dreamliners in service worldwide, the stakes are high for the world's largest aircraft manufacturer. Following a difficult development, Boeing has several hundred 787s on order at roughly $200 million apiece. The Dreamliner is the first commercial aircraft to have extensive use of lithium-ion batteries, which can hold more electrical power in a smaller, lighter space. The battery type, used in starting the 787s two engines and running its auxiliary power system, is susceptible to thermal runaway -- a chemical chain reaction -- if overcharged or undercharged. Resulting fires can be difficult to extinguish. The safety board has determined that thermal runaway and a short circuit occurred on the damaged 787 in Boston. But it has not concluded which event occurred first, or whether they were the cause or the effect of the fire. Hersman noted that the safety board has long had concerns about lithium-ion battery technology because of fire risk. ""That is never more important than in aviation,"" Hersman said. ""They (aircraft) don't have the opportunity to pull over when there's a fire. They don't always have accessible compartments. They don't have fire suppression in some of those areas. And so that is where we have raised concerns in the past."" The NTSB also has concerns about that battery technology being shipped as cargo, saying the packaging and labeling is crucial to safe shipment. But she expressed hope that there were technological solutions to the technological problems. ""We want to see that (battery technology) move forward. But the safety side of that is making sure that you've done the right risk assessment; that you understand what the failure modes are and that you've mitigated any potential risks."" Lithium-ion battery experts consulted by CNN say the batteries are safe for use in aviation. ""The lithium-ion batteries can be safely transported on an airplane as long as the appropriate procedure for transporting them is followed,"" said Jian Xie of Purdue University's School of Engineering and Technology. In fact, ""these lithium-ion batteries are safer than most chemicals being transported,"" he said. Jian Xie said he believes the root cause of the Boston fire was a problem with the management or the monitoring system of the battery, not the battery itself. ""If you ban the transportation of lithium-ion batteries, everyone has to throw away their laptops, cell phones, iPads, etcetera, before they board the airplane. Can you imagine that?"" he said. Battery expert Dan Doughty also said batteries almost never self-combust. ""You can never say never. But it is almost impossible to have a thermal runaway that would cause the combustion that you're talking about,"" he said. Lithium-ion battery failures during use ""are very rare,"" said Doughty. ""The statistics that we have are on computer batteries. And the cells that go into computer batteries have a failure rate of one in 10 million or even one in 40 million cells. So it's quite rare,"" he said. However, the fire incidents aboard the two Dreamliners very early in the plane's life has raised concern among safety experts. Boeing has said its technical experts are working ""around the clock"" and are focused on ""resolving the issue"" and returning the 787 to service.","Lithium-ion batteries at center of Boeing Dreamliner grounding .

"(CNN) -- A Japanese carrier has revealed that it replaced faulty batteries on its Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet last year, as aviation authorities worldwide continue to ground the aircraft amid safety concerns over the devices. In an interview with the New York Times, All Nippon Airways (ANA) said the aircraft's main battery failed to start normally on three occasions and had to be replaced along with the charger. In other cases, one battery showed an error reading and another, used to start the auxiliary power unit, failed. All the events occurred from May to December of last year, the report said. Megumi Tezuka, spokeswoman for ANA, told CNN Wednesday that 10 lithium ion batteries on its 787s were replaced in 2012, with a low charge being reported on some of the devices on board the aircraft. However, she said the problems were discovered during maintenance and therefore categorized as minor troubles. She added the airline was not required to report the faults to regulators. The news comes as an inspection of the Japanese company that makes the batteries found no serious problem with the devices. U.S. and Japanese officials carried out a joint inspection at the facility in the city of Kyoto where GS Yuasa makes the batteries. While investigators found several issues in quality control at the company, they did not uncover any serious problems that can be linked to recent incidents involving Dreamliners, Yasuo Ishii, director of air worthiness standards at the Japanese transport ministry, said Tuesday. Two recent incidents -- a fire aboard the Japan Airlines aircraft in Boston's Logan International Airport on January 7, and a smoke alarm aboard a plane flying over Japan on January 16 -- prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ground all Dreamliners in the United States, and other nations across the globe quickly followed suit. What's wrong with the Dreamliner? The investigation has now shifted from the battery maker to the manufacturer of the system that monitors the battery's voltage and temperature, Ishii said. Officials from the FAA and the Japanese transport ministry on Monday began checking the quality control at Kanto Aircraft Instrument Co., in Kanagawa prefecture, according to Ishii. They haven't found any serious problems so far, he said. Kanto Aircraft Instrument declined to comment on the matter. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said last week it had determined that the lithium ion battery on the Boston aircraft experienced a ""thermal runaway"" and a ""short circuit."" But safety investigators have not determined which event occurred first, or whether they were the cause or the effect of the incident. In a thermal runaway, a battery releases energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the battery and causing further damage. In an electrical short, electricity follows an unintended path. Boeing, meanwhile, has said its technical experts are working ""around the clock"" and are focused on ""resolving the issue"" and returning the 787 to service. There are currently 50 wide body Dreamliners in service globally, with several hundred on order. ANA was the first carrier to use the 787 and currently has 17 in service -- more than any other airline. How Boeing can bounce back from Dreamliner problems .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Texas shot and killed an escaped prisoner early Saturday, several days after they say he stabbed a detective tasked with taking him across the country. Alberto Morales, 42, was killed shortly after he was located in a wooded area in Grapevine, near Dallas, said Grapevine Police Department spokesman Sgt. Robert Eberling. With the help of a helicopter, authorities found Morales not far from a home where someone stole jewelery and men's clothing. ""At this point, as far as the investigation is concerned, Mr. Morales was shot and is now deceased. This matter is still under investigation ... and we'll have more details at a later point,"" Eberling told reporters. He declined to say whether the escapee was armed and did not elaborate on the circumstances surrounding Morales' death. Eberling stressed the case remains under investigation. Morales' death ended a manhunt that began on Monday. It was then that police say he stabbed a Florida detective multiple times and disappeared. That detective, and another, had been transporting Morales from Florida to Nevada. The trip began on a Miami-Houston-Las Vegas flight. Prior to landing in Houston, Morales began ""acting erratically,"" according to a statement from the Miami-Dade Police Department. As a result, he and the detectives were not allowed to board their connecting flight, it said. The detectives rented a vehicle and continued on their way, making a pit stop in Grapevine to use the restroom. While one of the detectives was inside, Morales stabbed Det. Jaime Pardinas, a 28-year veteran, multiple times, and fled the scene, authorities said. Pardinas was treated at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas and was listed in serious condition, the statement said. Morales was arrested in Nevada in 2008. He was brought to Miami, where he was jailed pending a 2003 case alleging burglary, kidnapping and sexual battery. In December, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which was to run consecutive to a Nevada sentence. Details of Morales' Nevada case were not immediately known. When asked by a reporter how authorities felt at the conclusion of the manhunt, Eberling said he was relieved for local residents. ""We knew we had a dangerous individual out there in the streets. And he was capable of being extremely violent. So that is what we're relieved of. The fact that Mr. Morales is now deceased is not something that we celebrate, but our jobs is to apprehend the fugitive,"" he said. ""It is a relief to this community and I think a lot of folks in this area can now have a moment of rest.""","Alberto Morales, 42, was shot early Saturday .

"(CNN) -- A few days ago, a sportswriter friend of mine posted on his Facebook page a picture of a child-sized athletic T-shirt with the words ""Destined to Be Drafted"" printed on front. He commented, ""Just in case anybody thought youth sports culture ISN'T getting outta hand."" Sandusky's child sex abuse allegations: In his own words . On the same day, my home state Arkansas Razorbacks, recently scandalized by the professional and personal improprieties of former football coach Bobby Petrino, introduced their new uniforms with a 1,300-word press release complete with a quote from a freshman player saying, ""I like to look good, so when I was being recruited the uniforms definitely had something to do with my interest in a school."" What does any of this have to do with the abhorrent actions of which Jerry Sandusky is accused? Sandusky is one individual being tried for very specific crimes, sexually abusing young boys. But in the midst of this scandal, it's hard to not also indict the culture that coddled him. College football is one of our national obsessions. We get so wrapped up with the thrills of the games. What we overlook is that like any big-time college sport, it perpetuates the fantasy, which the fans and media readily buy into, that its players are still kids and its coaches are moral leaders. In other organizations or institutions that have dealt with horrible scandals of sexual abuse -- like the Boy Scouts and the Catholic Church -- their leaders actually have some claims to moral and civic authority. But why have we granted moral authority to college coaches? It's partly because we all idolize winners. Winning games gives coaches a cloak of invincibility. They are considered ""first citizens,"" as ancient Rome called its emperors, rather than citizens first. They seem immune to the rules that apply to the rest of us. It's easy to think they can do no harm. For that reason, we excuse them when they throw tantrums, which we interpret as being ""passionate."" In any other profession, those tantrums would result in being fired. Where the head football coach is the highest paid state employee, it's no wonder that a sense of proportion has gone out the window. In Arkansas, for example, six of the top 10 salaried state employees are in the state university's athletic department. Under this culture of adulation, someone like Sandusky is more likely to get a pass for questionable behavior. No one could have conceived of him as being anything other than an upright molder of men, even if there were signs to the contrary. Those who come into contact with him are more likely to look the other way than to scrutinize anything unusual. Opinion: In Sandusky trial, a second act for McQueary? At the same time that we elevate the coaches to a pedestal, we infantilize the college athletes. Whenever I hear announcers refer to ""these kids"" on a team -- while in the context of a police report or a voting booth or a battlefield death, an 18-year-old would be a ""man"" -- I have to shake my head. To the athletic programs, they are essentially low-wage workers with high school degrees in a big business. The sooner we abandon the pretension that all players are student athletes and that coaches are role models for men, the sooner we can regain a sense of reality. That said, there's plenty of room for athletes to be students and vice versa. There also are many good coaches out there who would make strong mentors to kids of all ages. But let's not pretend that coaches are on a higher moral ground just because they are heading a winning team. If we see coaches as real people rather than heroes, then we can regain a healthy dose of skepticism. Maybe then toddler T-shirt messages will go back to being appropriate for the age and a college sports team's uniform won't matter as much. 'Sandusky 8' describe seduction, betrayal .

"(CNN) -- Brazil's most influential modern architect Oscar Niemeyer, whose resume includes the United Nations building in New York, passed away on Wednesday. He was 104. Niemeyer spent the last month in a hospital in Rio de Janeiro in frail health, according to his doctor Fernando Gjorup. Neimeyer died after suffering respiratory complications, Gjorup told reporters. Niemeyer was one of Brazil's geniuses, said Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. ""We have to dream, or else things won't happen,"" Rousseff said, using one of Niemeyer's famous sayings. ""Few have dreamed so intensely and accomplished so many things like him."" The president offered the presidential palace, one of Niemeyer's well known designs, to his wife for his wake. Eduardo Paes, the mayor for Rio de Janeiro, has declared official mourning for three days. ""(He was) one of the greatest geniuses that Brazil gave the world, Oscar Niemeyer was more than a brilliant and innovative architect. He defied logic and twisted ways to create true works of art,"" Paes said. Born and raised in Rio, Niemeyer was an early master of modern architecture in Brazil, a fingerprint that became clear after he was commissioned alongside his mentor Lucio Costa to design Brazil's new capital, Brasilia. Niemeyer ""incorporated curves and raw, unfinished materials"" with a ""balance between horizontal and vertical buildings, rectangular volumes,"" the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization said. Brasilia is a World Heritage Site. Among his other works are the presidential palace, the ministry of justice building and the presidential chapel. In Rio, his sinuous curves inspired the works of many poets, writers and songwriters. He designed the Sambadrome, where the samba schools hold their parades every year. In Sao Paulo, he worked with a landscape architect to build one of the largest city parks in Latin America, the Ibirapuera Park. Paes summed up what many felt when he said ""Brazil and the world lost today a man who dedicated his entire life to produce beauty.""

"New Delhi (CNN) -- As the men accused of raping and robbing a Swiss tourist in central India appeared in court Monday, protesters said the case is a troubling example of the growing problem of violence against women. Opposition lawmakers organized protests throughout India's Madhya Pradesh state Monday and called on the state's home minister to resign. ""We are protesting due to a collapse of law and order,"" said Ajay Singh, an opposition leader. ""This state has the highest number of women abductions and crimes against women."" Demonstrations erupted nationwide after the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi in December. Now last week's attack on a Swiss woman is focusing fresh attention on sexual assaults in India. The woman and her husband were on a cycling tour across India and had set up camp near a forest in Datia district last week when a group of men allegedly assaulted them, beating the husband and raping the wife, according to police. The six suspects appeared in court Monday and will remain in custody until their next court appearance on Tuesday, said Chandra Shekhar Solanke, a district police superintendent. ""We have taken swift action,"" Shivraj Singh Chauhan, chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, told CNN IBN. ""All the accused have been arrested and I assure that we will not allow such cases to happen again."" The men accused of attacking the Swiss couple last week are members of a local tribe who live near where the travelers were camping, said D.K. Arya, deputy inspector general of police. Investigators have recovered valuables stolen from couple during the attack, police said Monday, including a laptop computer, a mobile phone and 10,000 rupees ($185). The woman, who was briefly hospitalized after the attack, alleges that four of the men raped her, according to Inspector-General S.M. Afzal. The other two men arrested by police are suspected of involvement in robbing the couple, he said. Afzal said the six suspects had confessed. But confessions in custody are not admissible as evidence in Indian courts. Police have sent blood samples from the men for DNA testing. Authorities offered different accounts Monday of the next steps in their investigation. Police Superintendent Solanke said the female victim had already helped identify suspects when arrests were made Sunday. But Arya, the police deputy inspector-general, said Monday that the victim hadn't seen the suspects since their arrest. She told authorities she would not be able to identify the suspects because the attack happened when it was dark, Arya said. Instead, her husband will likely be tasked with identifying the suspects in a police lineup, Arya said. The couple, who had been staying at a guesthouse in Datia district during the investigation, are in New Delhi at the moment, according to Afzal. Police have asked them to return to Datia for a possible identification of the accused men, he said. Linus von Castelmur, the Swiss ambassador to India, issued a statement Monday saying that the two are currently recovering at the embassy in New Delhi but had ""expressed their readiness to fully cooperate in the ongoing investigation and identification process."" They plan to stay in India for the time being, he said. The case comes at a time in India when there are calls for stricter laws on sexual assault and changes in cultural attitudes toward women. The December gang rape on the New Delhi bus spurred protests in the nation, where most women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations. The victim of that attack later died in a Singapore hospital. Police charged five men with murder, rape and kidnapping in the case. Last week, one of the accused died in custody. Police said the accused man, Ram Singh, hanged himself in a jail cell, but his lawyer and parents claim he was murdered. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh and Sumnima Udas reported from New Delhi. CNN's Aliza Kassim reported from Atlanta.","Police say the six suspects have appeared in court .

"New York (CNN) -- Renowned speculative fiction writer Harlan Ellison is about to be inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, recognizing a career that has spanned more than five decades in which he's made contributions to literature, television and film. Called one of the ""great living American short story writers"" by the Washington Post, Ellison will be honored at the Hall of Fame event Saturday in Seattle. The award, coming 55 years after Ellison began his writing career, celebrates the achievements of a writer who has nearly done it all; collecting 10 Hugo awards, three Nebula awards, 18 Locus Poll awards, the Bradbury award, six Bram Stoker awards, the Edgar Allan Poe award and two George Melies film awards. Ellison, 77, won't be at the ceremony and has asked author Neil Gaiman to accept the award on his behalf. Editor Gardner Dozois and artists Vincent Di Fate and Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud will also be honored at the weekend-long event. Ellison, who had been extremely ill for several months, said in a telephone interview that he's in the ""last stages of something."" ""And I don't have a cold,"" he sarcastically noted. Founded in 1996, the Hall of Fame has honored science fiction's giants, including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ursula K. Le Guin, Isaac Asimov, Gene Roddenberry and Ridley Scott. As part of the ceremony, inductees' laser-etched images on the glowing Hall of Fame permanent display are unveiled. Brooks Peck, curator of the Experience Music Project/Science Fiction museum, says the decision to induct Ellison wasn't a difficult one. ""He was always very encouraging of young writers, plus he had a big personality which people really enjoy,"" Peck said. ""Harlan Ellison was very influential in the new wave era of science fiction in the late 1960s and 1970s when the genre changed from the traditional science fiction of hard science and adventure stories to writing that took up social consciousness, exploring the soft sciences of psychology and sociology and where the prose became more experimental,"" Peck added. ""The new wave brought things back down to earth and became more character-centric."" Born in Cleveland in 1934, Ellison moved to New York City in 1955, publishing more than 100 short stories and articles, then his first novel, ""Web in the City"" (1958) about street gangs in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. Ellison's works have sold millions of copies and been translated into more than 40 languages. Ellison's most recognized works include ""Deathbird Stories,"" ""Strange Wine,"" ""Approaching Oblivion,"" ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream,"" ""Love Ain't Nothing But Sex Misspelled,"" ""Ellison Wonderland,"" ""Memos from Purgatory,"" ""Shatterday"" and ""Stalking the Nightmare."" Fans of the original science fiction TV classic series ""Star Trek"" know Ellison as the author of one of the most critically acclaimed episodes, ""The City on the Edge of Forever,"" which featured Joan Collins. Ellison, who still uses several Olympia typewriters to do his work and says he despises the Internet because it's ""killing books,"" has several projects ready for release. He wouldn't pick any favorites from his own work. ""I love them all. Even the lame ones. I am proud of them all,"" he said. And yet for all of Ellison's accomplishments, he is considered by some to be one of America's most prolific best-selling authors who remains unknown by many readers. Gordon Van Gelder, editor and publisher of Fantasy and Science Fiction magazine, the second-oldest continuously running science fiction magazine in the U.S., says Ellison was always far from a mainstream writer. Ellison made his first sale to that magazine in 1961 and was a major contributor in the late 1960s before writing a film column for years. ""At his core I'd call him a fabulist,"" Van Gelder said. ""He wasn't one to write science fiction in a traditional vein."" Van Gelder likens Ellison's early work to that of the English science fiction writer, Michael Moorcock, who in the 1960s as editor of the science fiction magazine New Worlds helped usher in a new wave of writing for the genre. ""What differentiated Harlan's work was the intensity,"" Van Gelder said. ""The vividness of the imagination.""","Ellison, 77, has been writing for 55 years .

"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- Like nearly every high school senior who has donned a cap and gown, Scott Lauridsen was excited. Finally, after four years at Joplin High School, it was time to go. Graduate. Celebrate. Step up to the next stage of his young life. ""I was excited -- ready to start things new and move onto college and experience life and then all this happened,"" said Lauridsen, 18, one day after one of the deadliest American twisters on record ripped through his hometown of Joplin, Missouri. And now? ""Now I'm just worried about helping out with the community and getting things back together,"" he said. A recent graduate's joy: Another casualty of Sunday's terrible tornado. Lauridsen was one of about 450 seniors to receive a diploma from Joplin High School this year. Their graduation ceremony at a local university wrapped up just as the storm started to roll in. Students streamed out of the gymnasium and onto an open lawn as proud parents, family and friends snapped pictures -- smiling graduates against a backdrop of darkening skies. A light rain began to fall and people rushed to their cars. Aaron Frost, another graduate, left with his girlfriend. They were headed to a restaurant to meet his family when Frost, 18, got a call from his mother. ""She pretty much demanded that we pulled over,"" he said. ""I would have drove right into the storm. My mom pretty much saved me there."" Frost and his girlfriend ducked into a Fast Trip convenience store and took cover, along with about 18 other people, inside a walk-in cooler. ""You can't really do anything,"" he said. ""We just bent over and covered our heads."" A piece of glass struck Frost's hand but otherwise he is fine. The store and his car were not as lucky. Later, Frost went by his old school, where the roof was ripped off and debris was strewn across the lawn. Kerry Sachetta, principal at Joplin High School, described the damage as ""terrible."" ""I walked around as much as I could to see it and it just looks like it's been bombed from the outside in,"" he said. Joplin's public school district has canceled classes for the rest of the year. ""To see my high school flattened is especially hard,"" said Frost. ""It's indescribable."" His concern is made worse by the uncertainty of not knowing what happened to some people from his community. Phone service in the area is spotty and friends have struggled to connect. Lauridsen said Will Norton, another Joplin graduate and a friend of his, is missing. Norton and his dad were driving home when the storm hit. A Facebook page has been set up to help locate him. ""My dad said ... his seat belt snapped and he was ejected through the sunroof,"" said Sara Norton, Will's sister. Their father is in stable condition, she said, but the family is still trying to pin down exactly where Will might be. ""It just makes me sad to know so many of my classmates have lost their homes and some of them are still missing,"" said Taylor Costley, 18, another 2011 graduate of Joplin High School. She rode out the storm at home with her father, brother and grandparents, fearing for her mother who was briefly -- but terrifyingly-- out of contact. ""Graduation's supposed to be a joyous occasion, but we can't really feel that happy about it,"" Costly said. ""At the same time, I'm so thankful I'm OK and my family's OK."" CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","A Facebook page is set up to help locate missing graduate Will Norton .

"(CNN) -- Less is proving to be more for Christof Innerhofer, who equaled an Italian skiing record by claiming his third World Cup victory this season on Saturday. The 28-year-old's pre-season preparations were hampered by a back problem, but he is enjoying his best campaign following his downhill win at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany -- where he won a full collection of gold, silver and bronze medals at the 2011 world championships. ""I struggled a lot during the preparation period,"" Innerhofer said on the FIS World Cup website after matching the feat of compatriot Kristian Ghedina in the 1996-97 season. ""To think I won three times after not being sure if I would even be here this season is something very special. All I want to keep thinking about is how to keep this momentum and get faster every race."" Innerhofer, who was 14th in the downhill at this month's world championships, triumphed by just 0.12 seconds from surprise runner-up Georg Streitberger. With Klaus Kroll claiming third, Austria became the first country to pass 500 World Cup podiums in any discipline, men or women. ""It's a perfect day,"" said Streitberger, who was fourth in the world championships on home snow at Schladming, where Austria's only individual gold came on the final day last Sunday for overall World Cup leader Marcel Hirscher in the slalom. ""My last podium was in Kitzbuhel in 2011 and since then I struggled with an injury, and to come back and finish on the podium is amazing,"" he said. ""I was very fast in the first section, than I might have lost the victory in the middle due to some small mistakes but altogether it's an incredible day."" With world champion Aksel Lund Svindal finishing fifth to remain on top of the downhill standings, Hirscher holds a 169-point lead over the Norwegian going into Sunday's giant slalom -- where he will take on three-time Schladming gold medalist Ted Ligety of the U.S. Meanwhile, Tina Maze maintained her massive lead in the women's World Cup standings with fourth place in the downhill at Meribel in France on Saturday. The Slovenian is 858 points clear of Germany's Maria Hofl-Riesch, who took second place behind Spain's surprise victor Carolina Ruiz Castillo. Ruiz-Castillo claimed her maiden win, and only her second podium placing -- some 13 years after her first in a giant slalom in Sestriere, Italy. Born in Chile, but a longtime Spain representative at international level, the 31-year-old became the first skier from her country to win a women's World Cup downhill. ""So far it's been my best season and I'm incredibly happy about what happened today"", she said. ""This is the result of a lot of work and the collaboration with the French team.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi seemed increasingly cornered Sunday as security forces defected to the opposition in a town near the capital and the United Nations Security Council voted for tough restrictions on and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime. Former security forces said they had switched sides and joined the opposition in Zawiya, a town about 55 kilometers (35 miles) from the capital, Tripoli. Some buildings in Zawiya showed signs of damage, including a freshly burned-out police station. CNN's Nic Robertson, on a government-organized trip to Zawiya, saw armed civilians taking defensive positions on rooftops to prepare for a possible effort by Gadhafi loyalists to retake the town. About 2,000 people took part in an anti-government protest there, some standing atop tanks or holding anti-aircraft guns. They said they wanted the government overthrown, calling Gadhafi a ""bloodsucker."" Later in the day, CNN witnessed two smaller pro-government rallies that had apparently been organized by government officials for international journalists to see, Robertson reported. The opposition now controls several Libyan cities after weeks of protests inspired by demonstrations that toppled longtime leaders in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt. Gadhafi criticized the U.N. Security Council resolution Sunday, telling private Serbian station Pink TV by phone that council members ""took a decision based on media reports that are based abroad."" He added, ""If the Security Council wants to know about something, they should have sent a fact-finding committee."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Security Council measures -- which include an arms embargo, asset freeze, and travel bans for Gadhafi and members of his family and associates -- form ""one of the speediest international responses to a government targeting its own people."" ""We recognize the killings are ongoing,"" Clinton told reporters en route to a meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Switzerland. ""We recognize we need to advance the humanitarian, the military, judicial, and even forensic planning already under way."" British Prime Minister David Cameron and British Foreign Secretary William Hague both called on Gadhafi on Sunday to go. ""Libya's future has no future with him at the helm,"" Cameron said. ""Absolutely none."" Britain also announced it was freezing the assets of Gadhafi, five of his children, and those acting on their behalf. Gadhafi's son, Saif, denied the government used force on its own people. In an interview that ran Sunday with Christiane Amanpour for ABC's ""This Week,"" he was asked about numerous reports of attacks by government forces on civilians. ""Show me a single attack,"" he said. ""Show me a single bomb. Show me a single casualty. The Libyan air force destroyed just the ammunition sites."" The younger Gadhafi -- who is a prominent member of the government -- also played down anti-government protests. Just because ""10,000 or 5,000 people"" demonstrate against his father, he said, doesn't mean the entire population is against him. He had harsh words, however, for the Libyan diplomats who have turned their backs on his father, calling them ""hypocrites."" ""If you are strong, they love you. If not, they say goodbye. That is good. We get rid of them,"" he told Amanpour. Meanwhile, Gadhafi's nurse went home to Ukraine. Galyna Kolotnytska gained notoriety in November after WikiLeaks released a cable from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli describing Gadhafi's almost obsessive reliance on the woman, described as a ""voluptuous blonde."" Kolotnytska's daughter told CNN on Sunday her mother had returned but was not commenting. Tunisians on the border with Libya waved pre-Gadhafi-era Libyan flags in support of the opposition as tens of thousands surged towards the country that triggered the series of Arab world revolts. About 100,000 people have fled violence in Libya in the past week, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. CNN witnessed the Tunisian army, charities and ordinary Tunisians trying to help Libyans on the border. Refugees said Tunisians were offering them food, water, and even the use of phones. The Tunisian government reported Saturday that 40,000 people had crossed its borders since February 20, while Egypt reported 55,000 had crossed over since February 19, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Sunday. The evacuees include Tunisians, Egyptians, Libyans, and many from Asian countries. About 10,000 fled from Libya to Tunisia on Saturday, the Red Crescent said. ""Very large numbers of people amassed in the no man's land between Libya and Tunisia in extremely cold conditions,"" Red Crescent spokesman Joe Lowry told CNN on Sunday. ""People stood in the queue for six hours with no food, water, or access to sanitation."" The Red Crescent is affiliated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. At least four people were carried away in stretchers because of crush injuries and several lost consciousness as a result of the chaos. ""It was very worrying to see women passing their babies in cots over the crowd to keep them from harm,"" Lowry said. There were also chaotic scenes in Tripoli as people rushed to banks to claim a government handout of 500 dinars (just over $400) per family. There were also long lines in Zawiya. Pharmacies in Tripoli were running out of blood pressure and diabetes medicines, a source in the capital told CNN. Gadhafi has showed no sign of relinquishing power. Sunday, the world waited to see whether the threat of sanctions will have any effect on a country where the death toll from the recent unrest has topped 1,000, according to an estimate from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Saturday night, the United Nations Security Council voted 15-0 on the draft resolution, which also refers the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court. Gadhafi and others could face an investigation for potential war crimes. ""This resolution will be a signal (to) put an end to the fascist regime that is still in existence,"" said Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham, Libyan ambassador to the United Nations. Earlier Saturday, he renounced support for Gadhafi, calling him ""a leader who loves nobody but himself."" Hours before the Security Council's vote Saturday, Libya's budding opposition picked a former top official as its interim leader. Libya's deputy ambassador to the world body, Ibrahim Dabbashi, indicated that he and fellow diplomats support ""in principle"" a caretaker administration under the direction of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil. City councils in areas no longer loyal to Gadhafi chose Jalil to head an interim government that would represent all of Libya and ultimately be based in Tripoli, according to Amal Bogagies, a member of the coalition of the February 17 Uprising, and a separate Libyan opposition source. Both are based in Benghazi, the eastern city that is under the control of the opposition. Jalil was in Gadhafi's government until Monday, when he quit to protest the ""bloody situation"" and ""use of excessive force"" against unarmed protesters, according to Libyan newspaper Quryna. Protests began February 15 in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city. At least several other cities are now thought to be under opposition control, according to eyewitnesses.  There have been numerous reports of widespread violence -- some of it perpetrated by foreign mercenaries and security forces loyal to Gadhafi, and some by protesters. While CNN has staff in some cities, the network could not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya. CNN has also compiled information through telephone interviews with witnesses. CNN's Ivan Watson, Eve Bower, Ben Wedeman, Salma Abdelaziz, Talia Kayali, Richard Roth, Jack Maddox and Whitney Hurst contributed to this report.","NEW: Gadhafi's son: Libyan diplomats who turn their backs on Gadhafi are ""hypocrites""

"(CNN) -- Actor Larry Hagman, who created one of television's iconic villains with the treacherous J.R. Ewing of ""Dallas,"" died Friday, according to a family statement. He was 81. Hagman died at a Dallas hospital of complications from cancer, said the statement posted on Hagman's official web site early Saturday. ""Larry was back in his beloved Dallas, re-enacting the iconic role he loved most,"" it said. ""Larry's family and close friends had joined him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday. When he passed, he was surrounded by loved ones. It was a peaceful passing, just as he had wished for. The family requests privacy at this time."" Hagman shot to television superstardom in 1978 with the role of J.R. Ewing, the scheming Texas oil tycoon, in the prime-time soap opera ""Dallas."" He was the villain viewers loved to hate. Co-stars, fellow actors grieve over loss of Larry Hagman . In 1980, the show became a mega-hit with the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" plot line that left Americans guessing who pulled the trigger. The answer came on November 21, 1980, in an episode dubbed ""Who Done It?."" More than 350 million viewers tuned in around the world to find out Kristen Shepherd, the sister of J.R.'s wife, shot him. It remains one of the most watched television episodes in history. Ewing survived that shooting, and Hagman and the rest of the cast thrived for 14 seasons total before bowing out in 1991. He reprised the role for TNT's reboot of the series ""Dallas"" in June 2012. Hagman filmed appearances for the show's second season, which is set to air in January. (Like CNN, TNT is a division of Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting.) It was a role in which he clearly reveled, even developing a trademark laugh for the character. At one point, Hagman made up fake $100 bills emblazoned with his face and the words ""In Hagman We Trust"" to hand out to fans. In one of his final interviews on CNN, Hagman appeared alongside original ""Dallas"" cast members Linda Gray (Sue Ellen) and Patrick Duffy (Bobby) on ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" During the interview, Morgan described the character of J.R. Ewing as ""the dark dealer of evil scheming."" ""Moi?"" Hagman said, breaking into a wide smile. In a statement released Friday by Gray's publicist to KNBC-TV in Los Angeles, the actress described Hagman as ""my best friend for more than 35 years."" ""He was the pied piper of life and brought joy to everyone he knew. He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented and I will miss him enormously. He was an original and lived life to the full and the world was a brighter place because of him,"" the statement said. Hagman told Morgan when he was first approached about doing the ""Dallas"" remake, the first question he asked was: ""Are my friends going to be on the show?"" ""I wouldn't be doing it without them,"" he said. Word of Hagman's passing spread quickly late Friday and early Saturday, with celebrities and fans mourning his death. Actor William Shatner took to Twitter: ""My thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Larry Hagman. My best, Bill."" ""He was a wonderful human being and an extremely gifted actor. We will be forever thankful that a whole new generation of people got to know and appreciate Larry through his performance as J.R. Ewing,"" TNT said in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this very difficult time."" Hagman was born in Fort Worth, Texas, on the cusp of the Great Depression to actress Mary Martin and Ben Hagman, a lawyer. He spent a year at Bard College in New York and then embarked on a life in theater in Dallas and New York, according to his official website. He appeared onstage with his mother in ""South Pacific"" in England and even produced and directed several shows while in the U.S. Air Force. After getting married and leaving the service, Hagman returned to the United States and starred in a number of Broadway plays. His family then headed to Hollywood, where Hagman earned roles in such television shows as ""The Edge of Night"" and ""The Defenders."" Where's the cast of the original 'Dallas' now? Hagman's breakthrough role came in 1965, when he played astronaut Maj. Tony Nelson, or ""Master,"" as he was known to the scantily clad, 2,000-year-old genie played by Barbara Eden in the hit comedy, ""I Dream of Jeannie."" ""I can still remember, that first day on Zuma Beach with him, in the frigid cold. From that day for five more years, Larry was the center of so many fun, wild, shocking and, in retrospect, memorable moments that will remain in my heart forever,"" Eden said in a Facebook post on Friday, shortly after hearing of Hagman's death. ""...I, like many others, believed he had beat cancer and yet we are reminded that life is never guaranteed."" Eden signed off, simply: ""Goodbye Larry. There was no one like you before and there will never be anyone like you again."" Hagman kept busy after the show went off the air in 1970, appearing in guest roles in ""The Streets of San Francisco,"" ""The Rockford Files"" and ""Barnaby Jones."" In the 1990s, he starred in the television show ""Orleans."" Off screen, his drinking earned him unwanted attention from the tabloids, which chronicled his battle with alcoholism. In recent years, he went public with his wife's battle with Alzheimer's. Hagman 'one of my favorite people' He also suffered several health scares, including a bout with cirrhosis and a 16-hour liver transplant in 1995 that helped save his life. Last year, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with cancer, but at the time, Hagman called it ""a very common and treatable form."" He is survived by his wife, a son, a daughter and five grandchildren. People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .

"(CNN) -- When an anonymous donor gave art to the Goodwill as an early holiday gift this month, the staff thought it was junk. ""Across the board they thought it was ugly,"" said Shea Munroe, who sorts the art and collectibles donated at Goodwill Industries in Federal Way, Washington. Co-workers told her: ""What is that? And why would anybody want that?"" The art is actually a Salvador Dali original, by the master surrealist who in his day relished the role of public provocateur with his mind-bending imagery. The work is a colored etching, and the framed piece even features the familiar Dali motif of a melting watch, placed on the wrist of a pointing hand. Its title is ""Reflection"" or ""Reflections,"" from ""The Cycles of Life Suite,"" and the art is signed by Dali and numbered ""126/150."" The work is also labeled as an ""etching and photolithography from collage."" Munroe was familiar with Dali, and she researched the work and its attached letter of authenticity. She confirmed she had something special, though several co-workers knew nothing of the surrealist, not even his famously flamboyant moustache. Stolen Salvador Dali painting returned from abroad . ""This is probably the real deal,"" Munroe said of her discovery of the Dali work. ""The manager knew who he was right away, and we were both really excited."" Goodwill is now auctioning the art on its website. As of late Friday afternoon, the bidding reached $10,505. Goodwill has noted that the artwork's paper ""has some warping, as if from humidity,"" with some discolored speckling to one part of the matting and a few deep scratches and scuffs to the glass and frame, the website says. The online auction ends Monday at 7:30 p.m. PST. Goodwill doesn't know the donor, who managed to sneak away during a busy time at the drop-off facility, Munroe said. But the donor kept intact the back of the frame, which contained an envelope with a certificate of authenticity and registration number from a defunct gallery in North Hollywood, California. An appraiser retained by Goodwill also confirmed the authenticity of the Dali, and the charitable organization also ensured the art wasn't stolen, said Amanda Bedell, spokeswoman for Goodwill in Tacoma, Washington. The nonprofit provides employment and training programs to people with disabilities and disadvantages, and the group sells donated goods in more than 2,600 stores. Goodwill held on to the Dali for a week in case someone claimed it was accidentally donated, Bedell said. ""We don't know the background of what the circumstances were,"" Bedell said of the donation. ""It's a steady stream of people coming in. It's not necessarily documented what every person comes in with."" About 74 million people in the United States and Canada donate annually to Goodwill, Bedell said. ""We have a very busy donation door, and we have several people who work that door,"" Munroe said, explaining how the donor was able to remain unknown. When a signed piece of art arrives at a donation center, Goodwill sets it aside for special review, Munroe said. Most donated goods are sold at Goodwill stores, but prizes such as the Dali are auctioned online -- to maximize their value, said Munroe, who works for Goodwill's online department. The Dali is the highlight of her past six years of working for the nonprofit, in addition to her two years of service in the 1970s, she said. Until this month, the biggest donations she oversaw were professional 35-mm cameras that fetched $8,400 on Goodwill's auction website, she said. To the anonymous donor, Munroe, 58, offered a message: ""I would say thank you for helping us with our mission because we have a lot of programs that put people to work, and it's people right here in the communities."" The bidding for the Dali piece is still short of the most prized art auctioned by Goodwill: A Frank Weston Benson oil painting, dated 1924 and also donated anonymously, was sold online by Goodwill in 2006 for $165,002.","An anonymous donor drops off a framed piece of art at a Goodwill in Washington state .

"(CNN) -- ""Even if you know the way,"" an ancient Korean proverb advises, ""ask one more time."" If North Korea's latest cycle of misdeeds, followed by international censure, followed by menacing words out of Pyongyang has a familiar ring to it, it is because this behavior has become a fixture of the accordion-like rhythm of Northeast Asian security. But a familiar path is not the same thing as a prudent one. It would be a mistake to let North Korea's young leader think he has inherited the family license to provoke with immunity. Let's briefly retrace the recent cycle of provocation, sanction and threat. On December 12, North Korea successfully launched a three-stage Unha-3 rocket. Although an Earth observation satellite (Shining Star-3) was placed into orbit, the ostensibly peaceful launch simultaneously advanced the North's long-range missile program that would put U.S. territory into target range. The triumphant launch came eight months after a similar rocket shattered over the Yellow Sea. Unha-3 can reach at least Guam now and most likely will be able to reach Alaska and Hawaii and the West Coast of the continental United States within the coming year or two. Adding a workable nuclear warhead will take a bit longer, perhaps three or more years, based on available information. The launch also delivered a success on the first anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death, conferring precious credibility on Kim Jong Un's fledgling regime. On January 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 2087. The resolution strengthens existing sanctions, curbing the travel and potentially the finances of the agencies and senior officials responsible for the rocket launch. Resolution 2087 marks a proportionate response to a specific infraction, as the April and December rocket launches violated previous Security Council resolutions enacted after the North's 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. The latest resolution leaves open a diplomatic path. It encourages North Korea to rejoin Six Party Talks with China, Russia, South Korea, Japan and the United States, aimed at realizing Pyongyang's official pledge of September 19, 2005, to move toward total denuclearization. But the U.N. measure also signals a ""significant determination"" to impose harsher measures in the event of a third nuclear test. Pyongyang's verbal reaction to sanctions has been swift and purposeful. Declaring sanctions to be tantamount to ""a declaration of war,"" North Korea is threatening further missile and nuclear tests. Invective is conveniently aimed at the North's ""sworn enemy"" the United States, as the Obama administration transitions its national security team for a second term. Just as South Korean President-elect Park Geun-hye seeks to instigate a more peaceful inter-Korean relationship, the North Korean regime appears to quash that initiative before it gets off the ground. Kim Jong Un himself may be threatened by the mere prospect of a summit with South Korea's Iron Lady. Seoul's economic prosperity and strong democratic institutions stand in stark contrast to those of North Korea, which appears incapable of abandoning its stereotypical ways, including the economic dead-end of a military-first policy. Despite a well-trodden history of provocation, sanction and threat, the North's latest threats should not be sloughed off as insignificant. North Korea's next nuclear test may well pave the way for a sizeable expansion of its nuclear arsenal. If its clandestine uranium-enrichment program has made strides, Pyongyang could demonstrate that it will gain access to a far larger pool of fissile material than simply its limited supply of weapons-grade plutonium. A larger pool of fissile material is a dual threat: As a vital part of an expanded nuclear weapon program and as a commodity to be sold on the black market. Beyond the obvious goal of regime survival, burgeoning nuclear and missile programs may be changing North Korea's tolerance for risk. In the space of a year, Kim Jong Un has struck a nuclear and missile moratorium with the United States (the so-called ""Leap Day"" deal), quickly abandoned that agreement, launched two long-range rockets in contravention of international law, and now is prepared for a third nuclear test at the Punggye-ri nuclear test facility in the northeast. Nuclear test number three could be conducted any time, from the next few days to the coming weeks or months. With a successful test, Pyongyang could in effect proclaim itself invulnerable, above the law, a nuclear-weapon state immune from international action. To allow such a misconception to become deeply engrained in the psyche of a leader not thought to be yet 30 years of age would be a grave mistake. At some point, a leaky defensive containment policy reaches a tipping point when the penalties of continuing it outweigh the gains of preserving it. Thus, the familiar path eventually becomes the wrong one. The world should be close to reaching that conclusion, and North Korea should begin to wonder when its luck will run out and it conducts one provocation too many. Above all else, the United States and its allies and partners need to fashion more offensive policy tools that exact steeper penalties for North Korean transgressions. Shifting from defensive to offensive containment requires the United States, South Korea and Japan to augment their defensive posture, through improved and more integrated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Japanese and South Korean space launches may indicate such steps are under way. In the event of a nuclear test, these steps should include the procurement and deployment of the latest ballistic missile defenses. Additional steps can be taken to reinforce the North-South maritime border west of the peninsula, the Northern Limit Line that was the site of both armed clashes in 2010, and the general state of readiness for a range of provocations. Beyond military steps, however, there needs to be corresponding legal, economic, political and social consequences for the North's leadership. While stopping far short of seeking regime change in North Korea, the United States, South Korea and others could help flood North Korea with radio and electronic information. For instance, it could begin by letting North Koreans know about the costs of its military-first extravagances. It could also let more North Koreans know about some of the extensive foreign financial holdings of the North Korean leadership. Last week, North Korea's official news agency opined that, ""A nuclear test is what the people demand."" If it's popular sentiment that the North wants to satisfy (given the supposed indigenous demand for a nuclear test), then the world ought to oblige North Koreans by providing information censored by the regime that could prompt different types of popular demands. Because escalatory steps must eventually either climb back down or lead to war, there should be a continuing willingness to talk with North Korea and, should it ever shift tack and commit responsible acts, the United States and its allies should be prepared to reward those acts with more fruitful exchanges and assistance. One aim of offensive containment is to move China from talking about pressure on North Korea to taking effective action to rein in its ally. Admittedly, these steps are probably bolder than what is currently in fashion in Washington or Seoul. Some officials may feel paralyzed. Perhaps they believe that even a deteriorating status quo is preferable to a heightened risk of sudden change. But sudden change is not foreordained by getting tougher, whereas certain changeâ€”more fissile material, more potential nuclear and missile know-how that can be sold under our noses to the bidders in the tumultuous Middle East and even to al Qaeda terrorist cellsâ€”becomes more likely every day North Korea moves forward with its mass-destruction technologies. In sum, although North Korea is taking the world down a familiar path, key officials need to ask anew whether the familiar path is still the best one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Patrick M. Cronin.","North Korea has threatened more missile and nuclear tests .

"Seoul (CNN) -- Picture the scene: dozens of computer hackers poring over their keyboards in a room filled with powerful computers, feverishly typing in code most of us could never comprehend. Their mission? To ""break in"" to virtual servers in a simulated world. Yet these particular hackers are not breaking the law, they are actually reinforcing it. They are taking part in a six-month program organized by the South Korean government to train some of the brightest code-breaking minds to become the nation's first line of defense in the war against cyber crime. According to the Korea Information Technology Research Institute (KITRI), the ""Best of the Best"" program is designed to train computer experts to defend against domestic and foreign cyber attacks. South Korea, which is one of the most Internet-connected nations in the world, is frequently subject to cyber attacks, especially from its northern neighbor, with whom it is still technically at war. In 2009, a number of government websites, including the presidential Blue House and National Assembly, crashed for days after being targeted with malicious code. And in 2011, a bank's entire computer system was hacked and shut down. The attack left tens of thousands of computers infected and some permanently damaged, according to the country's prosecutors. The Seoul government pointed the finger at Pyongyang, citing similarities in code used in earlier cyber attacks by South Korean nationals in collaboration with hackers believed to be connected with a North Korean intelligence agency, South Korea's prosecutor's office said in a press release. The North Korean government has yet to comment on the claims. The official value of the loss from the attacks is unknown, but the Hyundai Research Institute estimates the financial loss from the 2009 attacks alone at between $33.7 million and $50.5 million. Attacks from domestic and foreign sources are on the increase, authorities say. Cyber attacks rose by 37% from 2008 to 2011, according to Korea Internet Security Agency. ""Cyber attacks in general are getting more and more complicated. It is also known that North Korea is training highly skilled hackers,"" Jung Soo-whan from South Korea's Soongsil University told CNN. ""But what if they, for instance, hack into our nuclear power systems? We need a stronger defense system."" According to Lee Seung-jin, the chief consultant for the ""Best of the Best"" program, a cyber attack from the North is like fighting an asymmetric war. It is very difficult to counter attack. ""The South Korean Internet industry developed very fast. It is essential to train cyber security experts in all fields including those who will be working for commercial companies,"" said Lee, a prominent name in the South Korean hackers community. Sixty computer experts, from high school students to college students, were selected for the program. Most participants were already well known in the country and some are award-winning hackers from local and foreign hacker competitions. Kwon Hyuk, 17, is one of the survivors of the first phase of candidates on the program. He focuses his work on printer networking systems, an area easily exposed by cyber attacks. ""Companies may print confidential documents using network printers. If the security was breached, companies potentially could be eavesdropped,"" he said. The program, which is now down to 20 hackers, will only graduate one expert from six fields in its final stage. Aside from receiving 20,000,000 KRW ($18,500) as a prize, each graduate will then be recommended to companies or government agencies they wish to work for in the future. The six fields include digital forensic, security consulting, vulnerability analysis, mobile phone security, converged security and cloud-computing security.","South Korean government is training some of the brightest code-breaking minds .

Chris Kyle, America's self-proclaimed most deadly military sniper, was shot and killed February 2 at a gun range, alongside his friend, Chad Littlefield. Another veteran, Eddie Ray Routh, 25, faces murder charges in their deaths. ""I stand before you a broken woman,"" Taya Kyle, Chris Kyle's widow, told the crowd at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. ""But I am now, and always will be, the wife of a man who was a warrior both on and off the battlefield."" She wiped away tears and struggled to speak as she remembered her husband, whose casket was draped with the American flag. ""There isn't enough time to tell you everything you mean to me and everything you taught me. I know you had no idea you were teaching me, but there is something only God and I have known for a long time. God worked through you to make me into the woman I am supposed to be,"" she said. Thousands turned out at the stadium to remember Kyle, author of the best-selling book ""American Sniper."" Kyle learned to shoot on hunting trips with his father. He served four combat tours in Iraq and received two Silver Stars, among other commendations. While serving as a sniper in Iraq, Kyle wrote he personally had 160 confirmed kills from a distance of up to 2,100 feet -- more than any other U.S. serviceman, in any conflict. This led Iraqi insurgents to nickname the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Texan ""the devil"" and put a bounty on his head. In interviews promoting his book, Kyle offered no regrets. ""I had to do it to protect the Marines,"" he told Time magazine a year ago. ""You want to lose your own guys, or would you rather take one of them out?"" After his retirement from the Navy, Kyle became a businessman, a reality TV personalty, a supporter of fellow veterans, an avid hunter and an outspoken opponent of gun control. He is survived by his wife and two children. CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Chris Kyle was gunned down February 2, alongside a friend .

"(CNN) -- World Cup CEO Danny Jordaan has said South Africa is ready for the start of the 2010 World Cup which begins on 11 June, as the Australian national team became the first participating side to arrive in the host country. The Socceroos landed in Johannesburg on Wednesday evening, where they will train for their opening group match of the World Cup against Germany on 13 June. ""We are pleased to welcome Australia as the first team to arrive in our country. We all know that the stadiums are all ready, everything is in place and now the teams are finally here,"" Jordaan told the official FIFA Web site. ""More importantly though, our people are ready. From now, we have to concentrate on the kickoff match in a few days' time."" Wednesday also saw the official handover of the brand-new Cape Town Stadium -- which reportedly cost $350 million to build -- in the presence of FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke. Another 90,000 World Cup tickets will go on sale to the public on Friday morning -- including tickets for the opening games, semifinals and final. FIFA have also said that there are approximately 160,000 tickets -- out of the total 2.88 million available -- which remain unsold. Five-time World Cup winners Brazil joined Australia in South Africa on Thursday -- their opening match against North Korea will take place on 15 June at Johannesburg's Ellis Park Stadium. ""I am very impressed by the Brazilian team,"" the chairman of the 2010 FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee South Africa, Irvin Khoza told the FIFA Web site. ""The arrival of Brazil gives great confidence to all South Africans that this World Cup is really happening."" Meanwhile, the host nation registered a morale-boosting 2-1 victory over Colombia in Johannesburg on Thursday night, with all three goals coming from the penalty spot. Midfielder Teko Modise put Bafana Bafana ahead in the 18th minute in front of a crowd of 75,000 in the first international match at the new Soccer City stadium, though he was lucky to have a second attempt after the referee ruled that goalkeeper David Ospina moved too early before saving his first effort. Giovanni Moreno leveled three minutes later for Colombia, who did not qualify for the World Cup, with a spot-kick after Adrian Ramos was fouled. Striker Katlego Mphela's 58th-minute winner left South Africa unbeaten in nine matches since Carlos Alberto Parreira returned for his second spell as coach. Parreira's team continue their preparations against Guatemala on Monday before a June 5 clash with fellow finalists Denmark, who won 2-0 at home to Senegal on Thursday. Earlier, Honduras drew 2-2 with Belarus in Austria, while Chile beat Zambia 3-0 with two goals from Italy-based striker Alexis Sanchez and fellow South American qualifiers Uruguay crushed Israel 4-1 after a late double from substitute Sebastien Abreu.","Australia is first football team to arrive in South Africa ahead of the World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Nineteen-year-old Sergio Peña is living his dream. ""You know, to be a race car driver -- it almost doesn't seem real,"" he said. ""It doesn't seem like a job at all. It's more like play to me."" Peña may say it feels like play, but his work ethic says otherwise. ""He is a very methodical, very calculated race car driver,"" said Kip Childress, director of NASCAR's K&N Pro Series East. ""Sergio is a driver that uses a whole lot of thought behind the steering wheel."" Peña is from Virginia and is a first generation Colombian American. His love for racing started at age 4 when his father bought him a dirt bike. Jai Peña saw early on that there was no turning back. ""He loved it from day one,"" his father said. Peña has been competing professionally since he was 13. Motocross, Go-Karts, Formula cars -- he was game for anything. But his love for all things speed didn't come without a price. Jai Peña bankrolled his son's efforts for many years. He estimates he spent more than $1 million funding this son's dream of making it to the big time. ""I wouldn't change a thing,"" he said. ""The economy is tough, but if I had to do it again, I think I would do it again."" The sport of NASCAR is one that calls for major financial backing from sponsors in order for racers to have a legitimate chance to compete at a high level. NASCAR has at times been criticized for not doing enough to recruit minorities. The sport has made strides in recent years to remedy that problem, most notably through its ""Drive for Diversity"" program, which began in 2004. The program looks for ""marketable minority and female drivers with racing experience at the grassroots level,"" according to its website. More than 200 drivers apply to the program each year, and six to 10 are selected, the website says. ""The main goal of the 'Drive for Diversity' program is to get minorities a chance to enter their names into the sport,"" said Sergio Peña. ""It gives them a chance to get their names out there and advance themselves into higher-up NASCAR series or bigger teams."" Meet the technical men behind the Nascar scene . Peña completed the program, and his success helped him land a big sponsor, Hattori Racing Enterprises. With a major sponsor and team behind him, Peña's skills have become more refined. Last year was a breakout year of sorts for him. He finished the year tied for most wins in the K&N Pro Series East and came in fifth overall in points. But having a great support system and the right opportunities will only get you so far. Success in NASCAR is measured in wins. Peña is fully aware of this and attacks the track every time he gets behind the wheel. ""Sergio has done quite a bit of work, as well, and he has to perform,"" Childress said. ""Sergio has been able to get the job done on the race track."" ""I'm just another kid trying to make it in racing, just following my dream,"" Peña said. ""I'm very thankful for all the people who have helped me along the way throughout my career."" As for bringing more diversity to NASCAR? ""It's getting there, step by step,"" Peña said.

"(CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul, the son of libertarian-leaning Republican Ron Paul, threw some red meat to the Republican National Convention crowd Wednesday night by counting up the increase in the debt under the Obama administration. ""President Obama's administration will add nearly $6 trillion to our national debt in just one term,"" said Paul, whom Kentucky voters sent to the U.S. Senate in 2010. The facts: . The national debt -- the cumulative tab run up by the U.S. government over its lifetime -- stood at $10.6 trillion when Barack Obama took office in January 2009. It's currently running at nearly $16 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. The Congressional Budget Office estimates project another $600 billion budget shortfall for the 2013 fiscal year. That would make a $6 trillion increase in a single term, as Paul says. Fact Check: Paul Ryan misleads on debt panel's spending cut . But there are some catches. First off, Obama governed for much of the first nine months of his administration under the last budget of the Bush administration. But he did push an $800 billion-plus economic stimulus program through Congress early in his term, some of which was spent before that budget year ended in October. Bush's original budget proposal predicted a $407 billion deficit for 2009, but the final figure was $1.4 trillion, according to White House figures. Spending has gone up under the Obama administration: For the 2011 fiscal year, the second full budget of Obama's term, the federal government spent about $3.6 trillion, according to the White House budget office. That's about $600 million more than in 2008, the last full year under the Bush administration. But the budget gap has another element: Tax revenues have dropped during the 2007-2009 recession and remain lower than before. In the 2007 budget year, which ended shortly before the recession began, the federal government brought in nearly $2.6 trillion; that number fell to $2.1 trillion in 2009 and is projected to total $2.4 trillion by the time this budget year ends in September. The verdict: . True, but incomplete. While budget shortfalls have added $6 trillion to the national debt since January 2009, some of that spending was already in the pipeline, and some of it is the result of the economic slump that has cut into tax receipts.

"Editor's Note: Neil Miller, executive editor of the film Web site FilmSchoolRejects.com, is an online film critic based in Columbus, Ohio. For another view, read here. Neil Miller says activists are making outlandish demands of a film that parodies Hollywood. COLUMBUS, Ohio (CNN) -- It is hard to imagine that DreamWorks and Paramount, the companies behind ""Tropic Thunder,"" did not foresee some sort of reaction from activist groups. With a film that attacks on all levels, making jokes at the expense of race, obesity and cognitive disabilities, the executives must have known it wouldn't sail smoothly in and out of theaters. That said, the reaction we've seen from activist groups in defense of the cognitively disabled has been astounding. The Disability Rights Coalition has gone beyond expressing their disapproval of the film in order to lay out a list of demands. Among those demands is that director Ben Stiller re-cut the film, modifying it to remove any reference to the word ""retard"" and any other ""disrespectful depictions"" from the film before it hits theaters this week. And those appear to be the simplest of their demands. Everyone has a right to be offended and to speak out against such an offense. The real issue concerning this debacle is whether groups should be drumming up public outrage and making outlandish demands of a Hollywood studio based on a movie, especially one that is clearly a parody of the Hollywood system itself. The answer is no. While I can personally empathize with groups who feel that some of the content in ""Tropic Thunder"" is offensive, it's hard to remain on their side when their otherwise reasonable argument turns into an overblown campaign against the insensitivities of the entire entertainment business. To imply that by not capitulating to group demands, DreamWorks and Paramount are in large part responsible for intolerance toward the cognitively disabled is ludicrous. Real intolerance is bred in homes, where parents fail to provide proper direction for their children, fail to place such things into the context of everyday life and fail to show their children the difference between right and wrong. On top of this is the issue of the film's R-rating. As often as critics in the entertainment world, myself included, have railed on the unfair practices of the MPAA, it is easy to see that their ratings system does work in some cases. In this case, the R-rating works as a warning: Audiences who see ""Tropic Thunder"" are in for an experience that is only intended for adults. Adults should have the ability to process the jokes employed by ""Tropic Thunder"" within the context of the film and recognize that the joke doesn't target those with disabilities. It satirically takes aim at actors who exploit roles in which they play disabled characters in order to garner acclaim and win awards. Since children might not be able to make that connection or understand that context, the R-rating serves a strong role. Perhaps the only major mistake by the studio was in placing the ""Simple Jack"" concept in the marketing campaign. In the film, the joke truly fades into the context of the storyline, but when pulled out of that context, it is left standing on a burning platform that could easily be interpreted as blatant insensitivity. But they have admitted that mistake and rectified it by removing the ""Simple Jack"" Web site. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on 'Tropic Thunder' Beyond that, the film itself keeps everything in the context of the joke, something that seems to be lost on activist groups. In fact, if those members of the cognitively disabled community are claiming that this isn't how they would like to be portrayed, perhaps they'll actually find themselves agreeing with the film upon viewing -- a film that mocks actors who choose to exploit portrayals of those with cognitive disabilities. While groups still have every right to be upset over the use of the word ""retard"" or any other ""disrespectful depictions,"" it is the nature of their response that should be questioned. Being upset about a movie is one thing, but holding Hollywood responsible for intolerance in America is something altogether different. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Miller: Filmmakers must have known ""Tropic Thunder"" would be controversial .
Demands made by activist groups are over the top, Miller says .
The film is a satire aimed at Hollywood, not at disabled people, he says .

"(CNN) -- If you know much about the real-time strategy game ""StarCraft II,"" you may have heard a term that will sound completely bizarre to people outside the video game world: A.P.M. It stands for Actions Per Minute, and it refers to the number of keyboard and mouse clicks a person can make during 60 seconds of time. The best players tend to average about 200 to 400 actions per minute, said Park Sang-ik, a ""StarCraft II"" coach in South Korea, which long has been home to the world's best players, who train professionally and can earn six figures. ""I don't think there is a particular way to make your hands move faster,"" he said. But don't fret. Coaches say A.P.M. is becoming less important in the competitive ""StarCraft"" world, particularly as more people jump to the sequel version of the game, from Blizzard Entertainment. And there are plenty of other tips the pros have to offer in addition to making your fingers move like those of Thing, the hand that runs all over the place in ""The Addams Family."" Here are five such tips, compiled from interviews with three of South Korea's best ""StarCraft II"" players, including MVP, MarineKing and SuperNoVa, as well as their coaches. Test them out and let us know what you think in the comments section below. 1. Finger exercises. Like a piano player practicing scales, pro ""StarCraft II"" player MarineKing does keyboard runs when he's warming up for a big match. Some of the fidgety exercises he practices are ""+a1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9a0"" and ""ASDF ASDF."" 2. Mental health. Mental toughness is the most important aspect of ""StarCraft II,"" said Kang Dong-hoon, coach of team Incredible Miracle, home to world champ MVP. Players should clear their minds before they play, he said, and they should visualize their strategies before a match. Such visualization will help players get off to a strong start and finish well, he said. 3. Physical health. It may sound strange, but pro video-gaming teams in South Korea include physical exercise as part of their training regiment. MVP's team runs, swims and lifts weights. 4. Know your enemy. The pros watch tape of their opponents' previous games before entering into a battle with them. Do they strike early? What are their common mistakes? This kind of analysis helps the player come up with a specific strategy to go for the win. Many weak players fall into routines, said Kang, from Incredible Miracle. The easiest way to beat someone is to spot and exploit these patterns. 5. Keep at it. Pro gamers in South Korea live at training centers, where they practice playing video games almost round the clock on some days. All of this practice seems to pay off. South Koreans are regarded as the dominant power in online gaming, particularly the ""StarCraft"" franchise. Kang said players in the country practice so much that ""normal people can't imagine"" what it would be like.","Pros and coaches offer ""StarCraft II"" training tips .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- As little Tatyana Larbi, aka Little Miss Muffett, sings about selling her cotton and twigs to the ""sister pigs,"" you can tell the young girl is enjoying her moment in the limelight, even if she can't see the audience's response. The mother of Brooke Stegall, 5, says opera gave her visually impaired child new confidence. The set and costumes are pretty basic. Most were made by parents and volunteers. But that doesn't matter to the beaming mothers, fathers and grandparents in the audience. The fact that these 10 children are performing this day is enough for them. All of the actors in the Pumpkin Pickle Pop Cookies Opera are visually impaired 4- and 5-year-olds. Two are blind, and the others have varying degrees of sight. All are students in Atlanta's Center for the Visually Impaired BEGIN program. But today is their last day here, and performing this 20-minute opera is their ""thank you"" to their families.  Watch an awe-inspiring opera performance » . ""These parents work so hard to make this happen,"" said Anne McComiskey, director of the program. She is very aware of the efforts that both the children and the parents put into the program. ""They have to give up vacation time from their jobs,"" she said. ""Some people travel two and three hours once a week to get here."" McComiskey says the program works with newborns, sometimes only days old, up to 5-year-olds. It helps parents understand what is possible for their visually impaired or blind children. ""First of all, we are teaching the parents how to teach their child,"" she said. ""Because some 90-odd percent of learning comes through your vision, we have to teach mommy and daddy how to do what they would do typically, a little differently."" She says with the infants, it can be even more basic. ""With a newborn, you're teaching them about their body. A lot of kids don't know they have feet. They have never seen them."" All of the children go to the center one day a week. The BEGIN program, which is an acronym for Babies Early Growth Intervention Network, was started in 1985 and has about 95 children go through the program each year. The course costs $250 to register, but financial assistance is available. McComiskey says the performance reinforces lessons learned during the course of the program. ""Because this is an opera, they are learning gestures that they wouldn't learn by watching someone else. And they are learning how to listen and respond. They are learning to work in a group. It's just many of the concepts that we have been teaching them for five years, coming to play in the opera."" Jacqueline Howard is the center's music therapist. She came up with the idea for the opera while talking with some of the teachers. She also sees lessons in the performance. ""If you have a visual challenge, you want to be safe in the space you're in, because you may not be able to see everything around you. So the movements help them feel safe in the space, and we learned to move, sing and play instruments at the same time, which is a challenge for anyone!"" Brooke Stegall, 5, played one of the five ""sister pigs"" in this opera loosely based on ""The Three Little Pigs,"" which added the twist of a few other nursery tale characters. Her mother, Rhonda, says the opera changed her daughter. ""She is just a naturally reserved child, and to see her go up there and just sing and do the motions and just smile and have fun -- it was just great."" McComiskey says that that is one of the goals of the program: to instill a sense of ""I can"" in the kids. In this case, all 10 students seem to have taken that lesson to heart. All of them will be attending mainstream kindergartens in their school districts next fall. ""That is most unusual, for a child that is blind or visually impaired to go right into a typical kindergarten,"" McComiskey said. McComiskey and the program's teachers worked hard to make sure they are more than prepared. ""We want our kids going into kindergarten ahead of the sighted children in literacy. So we want Tatyana reading Braille, and we want them to be using the long cane so that they can go to the office or whatever, just like anyone else can."" Adds Jacqueline Howard, ""I always say success breeds success, and the confidence they felt by completing this task, when they're asked to do other things, they'll remember, 'I did that. I can do anything.' "" Tatyana enthusiastically agrees after the performance. ""I am so proud of myself.""","Atlanta opera inspires visually impaired kids to ""do anything""

"(CNN) -- For Gen. Martin Dempsey, Thursday's move to open combat units in the U.S. military to women had its roots nearly a decade ago, on the streets of Baghdad. Dempsey took command of the Army's 1st Armored Division in June 2003, when Iraqi insurgents were starting to target American troops with sniper fire, grenades and roadside bombs. As he prepared for a trip outside his headquarters, he took a moment to introduce himself to the crew of his Humvee. ""I slapped the turret gunner on the leg and I said, 'Who are you?' And she leaned down and said, I'm Amanda.' And I said, 'Ah, OK,' "" Dempsey told reporters at the Pentagon. Opinion: Will infantry men accept women as peers? ""So, female turret-gunner protecting division commander. It's from that point on that I realized something had changed, and it was time to do something about it."" Thursday, Dempsey -- now chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff -- sat alongside Defense Secretary Leon Panetta as both men signed a directive that will open front-line posts to the roughly 200,000 women now serving  in the active-duty military. Panetta said the move is a bow to reality on the battlefield, where women in what are technically non-combat units already find themselves fighting alongside their male comrades. Single mom fought alongside combat troops in Afghanistan . ""The fact is, they have become an integral part of our ability to perform our mission, and for more than a decade of war they have demonstrated courage and skill and patriotism,"" Panetta said. Women made up 67 of the nearly 3,500 Americans lost in hostile fire in Iraq and 33 of the 1,700-plus killed in combat in Afghanistan; more than 600 in Iraq and 300 in Afghanistan were wounded. The ban on women in specialties such as armor, artillery and infantry dates back to 1994. The Pentagon loosened some of those restrictions in 2012, and Panetta said the result ""has been very positive."" ""If members of our military can meet the qualifications for a job -- and let me be clear, I'm not talking about reducing the qualifications for the job -- if they can meet the qualifications for the job, then they should have the right to serve, regardless of creed or color or gender or sexual orientation,"" he said. Several U.S. allies, including NATO members France, Canada and Germany, allow women to serve in combat posts. Earlier this month, the U.S. Army opened the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to women, and it has begun recruiting female pilots and crew chiefs. The Navy put its first female officers on submarines in the past year, and certain female ground troops have been attached to combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan. Dempsey said Thursday's announcement would be implemented ""over time and with careful analysis,"" but he added that the service chiefs were unanimous in their support for the move. By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military . The move is one of the last significant policy decisions made by Panetta, who is expected to leave in mid-February. It is not clear where former Sen. Chuck Hagel, the nominated replacement, stands, but officials say he was apprised of Panetta's announcement. The American Civil Liberties Union recently filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Defense, charging that combat exclusion is unfair and outdated. The plaintiffs, who include women awarded Purple Hearts, also say the exclusion places them at a disadvantage for promotion. Dempsey suggested allowing women into combat units may ease the military's ongoing problem with sexual harassment: ""I have to believe, the more we can treat people equally, the more likely they are to treat each other equally."" Thursday's announcement drew an early cheer from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, who served in Iraq as an officer in her state's National Guard. ""The first two women who earned Silver Stars since World War II, one was a military police sergeant. Another was a medic,"" Gabbard told CNN ahead of Thursday's announcement. ""And they both were operating on the front lines per se, under fire, under extreme duress, shoulder to shoulder with their male and female counterparts and exhibiting great courage and heroism and saving the lives of their brothers and sisters."" Opinion: A more equal military? Bring back draft . Not every position will open at once, however. Each service will have to examine its jobs and produce a timetable for integration. And Gen. Robert Cone, the chief of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, said the services are developing new physical standards to make sure recruits are capable of meeting the physical demands of combat roles. ""If you say, 'I want to be an infantryman,' we'll say, 'Can you pick up 54 pounds, you know, three feet in the air? Can you carry 66 pounds on your back?' "" Cone said. Cone said that's the biggest concern he hears from soldiers. And it's one echoed by Jonn Lilyea, a former infantry sergeant who now publishes a military blog, ""This Ain't Hell."" Lilyea, who fought in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, said he believes physical standards will be relaxed ""in order to force the acceptance of women in the combat arms specialties."" ""I know it's an eventuality, because the social scientists at the Pentagon are going to want to see numbers that get accepted in there so they can show how just the whole thing is,"" he said. Readers skirmish over women in battle . Dempsey said the services can still recommend closing a particular specialty or unit to women -- but ""They have to explain why, and I think there will be the right amount of scrutiny on that."" And Lilyea said he wasn't reassured by Dempsey's insistence that the brass is supportive. ""I'm sure they all stood and saluted and said 'Yes sir' and marched out smartly, but I don't think they're all 100% behind it,"" he said. But Gabbard said there will be women who qualify for combat units under today's standards -- such as a friend of hers from MP school. Opinion: Women in combat a dangerous experiment . ""She did 100 pushups in two minutes,"" Gabbard said. ""And she is a great example of one of our many fine women warriors that we have out there."" Panetta is setting the goal of January 2016 for all assessments to be complete and women to be integrated as much as possible, a senior defense official said Wednesday. The Pentagon must notify Congress of each job or unit as it is sent up to the secretary to be opened to women. Then the Defense Department must wait 30 days while Congress is in session before implementing the change. It is a marked difference from the way the military ended the exclusion of gays serving openly, or the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. In that case, there were no stipulations attached to openly gay service members. There was no staggered approach that integrated openly gay troops into units. It was instead done all at once, across the board. Former troops say time has come for women in combat units .

"(CNN) -- A Palestinian terrorist group claimed responsibility Monday for the attack on an Israeli border fence construction site that left one worker and three attackers dead, according to a North Sinai intelligence officer. The attack on Israel's southern border with Egypt was the work of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, according to the intelligence officer, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The group is an Iranian-backed militant group that calls for the destruction of Israel and creation of an Islamic state in its place. Three armed men conducted the attack Monday morning, and all were killed by Israeli helicopter fire, the officer said. Israeli officials have said security forces killed two gunmen. The militants targeted the construction site with a roadside bomb, an anti-tank missile and small arms fire, the Israel Defense Forces said. An Arab-Israeli construction worker died in the attack, the IDF said. Authorities identified the worker killed as Saeed Phashpashe, a father of four from Haifa. In another attack, a rocket fired from Gaza exploded at Israel's Hof Ashkelon regional council offices, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. No injuries were reported. It was not immediately known who was responsible for that attack. The IDF also said the Israel Air Force had scored a direct hit Monday on ""a terrorist squad attempting to fire a rocket at Israel from the northern Gaza Strip."" The Israeli government said Saturday that militants operating from Egypt had launched two medium-range rockets that landed near an airport construction site. No injuries were reported. The Haaretz newspaper in Israel quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying the Saturday attack was carried out at the behest of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood by Bedouin in the Sinai who had been supplied by Hamas. Gen. Saleh Al Masry, the head of North Sinai Security, told CNN that it is possible the rockets may have been fired from Sinai by Bedouin but the involvement of the Muslim Brotherhood was far-fetched. ""This attack took place on the first day of elections, and defaming the Muslim Brotherhood may have been an under-the-belt blow by Israelis to affect their ratings at the poll somehow,"" he said. The security vacuum in Sinai remains one of the major challenges to the Egyptian government and its new president. Bedouin tribes have kidnapped a number of tourists in the past months, seeking the release of fellow tribesmen detained in prison. In one case the government exchanged a Bedouin prisoner for two U.S. tourists kidnapped in Southern Sinai during their vacation. The Israeli government and the international diplomatic community have expressed concern that Islamic extremists may have taken harbor in Sinai after the January 25 uprising that toppled Mubarak. Usama Imam, an investigator with Egyptian National Security, expressed concern that Islamic Jihadists from Gaza have been infiltrating into Egypt through tunnels with the assistance of the Bedouin tribes. ""We are fighting armed Islamic extremists groups in Sinai like Takfir-Wal-Higra who were resurrected after the revolution and are clearly responsible for the bombings of the pipeline exporting gas to Israel,"" Imam told CNN . ""There is increasing evidence that al Qaeda cells are present in Sinai and we are tracking them with all our security capabilities "" Imam added. Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the attacks signaled a ""disturbing deterioration in Egyptian control of the Sinai."" ""We are waiting for the results of the election,"" Barak said. ""Whoever wins, we expect them to take responsibility for all of Egypt's international commitments, including the peace treaty with Israel and the security arrangements in the Sinai, swiftly putting an end to these attacks."" Militants have been launching attacks across the border with some frequency. In August 2011, militants crossed into Israel from Egyptian territory to attack civilian targets. Eight Israeli citizens were killed in the attacks, which Israel has said were the work of a terror group based in Gaza. Responding to the attacks, Israeli troops killed five Egyptian border guards while pursuing the militants. The incident strained relations between the two governments, with Egypt recalling its ambassador in protest. After an investigation, Israel apologized in October for the deaths of the Egyptian policemen. A rare statement of regret was issued in the days after the shootings. After the revolution in Egypt and the subsequent increase of instability in the nation's Sinai peninsula, the Israeli government has accelerated the pace of construction of a steel border fence that will run along the 260 kilometers (about 160 miles) of shared border. Originally proposed as a method of stemming the flow of illegal immigration into Israel, the $350 million fence is increasingly being regarded in Israel as a necessary defense against lawlessness and what Israel says is the growing influence of radical Islamist groups operating in the Sinai Peninsula. Construction is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Monday that the morning attack won't slow work on the security fence. ""This barrier is meant both to prevent terrorism and also to prevent the entrance of infiltrators,"" he said. ""Its construction is of supreme national interest.""

"(CNN) -- Say these names as fast as you can: Hoof Hearted, Whykickamoocow, Oh no it's my mother-in-law, Maythehorsebewithyou. It's not a playground tongue twister, but a legitimate list of horse names, announced at speed by racing commentators adept at wrapping their lips around some of the most difficult -- and ridiculous -- titles on the planet. Silly horse names are as much a part of the racing experience as ladies in hats or laying a bet. But naming a thoroughbred is also a fine art subject to strict international regulations, with the power to both sway punters and shape the horse's legacy. ""If you look at the big races, there are not many horses who win them without good names,"" British racing commentator Cornelius Lysaght said. ""Frankel (the superstar colt who recently retired after an unblemished 14-win career) was a cracking name. It was very distinctive, strong and easy to pronounce -- it absolutely jumped out of the microphone. ""Added to that was the fairytale story of trainer Sir Henry Cecil naming him after trainer Bobby Frankel, who died from cancer. It created a certain mystique around the horse."" So why are many horse names downright weird? It's partly a way of getting around rules dictating that no professional thoroughbreds have the same name. That includes names which are spelled differently, but phonetically sound the same. Names can be no longer than 18 characters, with up to seven syllables. Each name is also protected for 20 years, and up to 35 years if the horse goes to stud after retiring. Then there's the holy grail of names considered so important, they can never be used again. When people say, ""There'll never be another Frankel,"" they aren't wrong. The International Federation of Horseracing Authorities has put the champion horse on its eternally protected list, alongside such greats as Australian gelding Phar Lap and U.S. stallion Seabiscuit. One loophole does allow horses from different countries to have the same name -- provided they include the nation's prefix at the end. And if you want to name your horse after a person or company, you've got to have their permission. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously turned down a request by the late Clement Freud -- a former celebrity chef, politician and grandson of the famed psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud -- to name his horse after her. He called it Weareagrandmother instead. There's also the minefield of names deemed too offensive for the track. Among the risque suggestions which failed to get the seal of approval from the British Horse Racing Authority's administrative arm, Weatherbys, are: Chit Hot, Harry Balzitch, Pee Ness and Hucking Fell. The names of terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and IRA have also been turned away, though Weatherbys racing director Paull Khan admitted suspect names had ""slipped through the net"" in the past. ""You've also got to take cultural differences into account. In Britain, people would generally be quite flattered to have a horse named after them, but in France it would more likely be seen as an insult,"" he said. BBC commentator Lysaght has had to call some tongue-twisting horse names in a career spanning more than 30 years. ""A few complicated names in a tight finish can get a bit frightening,"" he said . ""If a few of the more difficult names go down in a race, I think deep down the commentator is thinking, 'Thank God that one's not involved anymore.' "" Thankfully for Lysaght, the most prolific winners in recent years have had sharp, easily pronounceable names -- think Frankel or Australian supermare Black Caviar. ""There's also a certain trend now for short, real words,"" he said. ""The Queen is renowned for naming her horses sensible, quite cleverly constructed words -- like Sea Shanty."" But can a horse's name affect its performance? Is it possible to have a champion horse called Loser? Lysaght believes a horse's name can be self-prophesying -- to an extent. ""Camelot's owners reserved the name 10 years ago -- they thought it was a marvelous name but there was no horse that came up to scratch,"" Lysaght said. ""They wanted to wait and attach it to a really great horse who would live up to the mythical title. As it turned out, he didn't quite get there in the end."" British colt Camelot came close to fulfilling his promise, winning this year's 2,000 Guineas and Epsom Derby but failing to complete the English Triple Crown after finishing second at the St. Leger Stakes. It's difficult to pinpoint a link between names and performance. But that still hasn't stopped horse names having an effect on punters' betting habits. ""I think it holds the most sway at something like the Grand National in Britain, where you've got a large proportion of inexpert betters,"" Khan said. ""You'll have lots of small bets on appealing names -- things that have a human element people can associate with or are cleverly constructed."" As for the horse's legacy, Khan puts it down to performance. ""I think the degree people feel attached to certain names is dependent on the performance of the horse -- not the other way around,"" he said. So if Khan had a horse, what would he name it? ""Worksop Bellyflop. It's a name that just jumped out at me when I gave a talk in Worksop, in the East Midlands, once."" It's no Camelot. But then, as Shakespeare's Juliet famously said: ""What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.""","Silly horse names are a traditional part of the horse racing experience .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Palestinian maker of a film nominated for an Oscar was briefly detained by U.S. officials who questioned the validity of his Academy Awards invitation as he and his family arrived in Los Angeles for this weekend's event, his publicist told CNN on Wednesday. The brief detention of Emad Burnat, a West Bank farmer who spent five years making his ""5 Broken Cameras"" home video in his village of Bil'in, was quickly criticized by fellow documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, whom Burnat had contacted for help while being questioned at Los Angeles International Airport. U.S. authorities also placed Burnat's wife and 8-year-old son, Gibreel, in a holding area at the airport Tuesday night, Moore said on his Twitter account. ""Apparently the Immigration & Customs officers couldn't understand how a Palestinian could be an Oscar nominee. Emad texted me for help,"" Moore tweeted. ""After 1.5 hrs, they decided to release him & his family & told him he could stay in LA for the week & go to the Oscars. Welcome to America."" 2013 Oscars: Get to know the best actor nominees . Julia Pacetti, Burnat's publicist, told CNN that Burnat e-mailed her and Moore about how ""immigration authorities were telling him he needed to give them a reason for his visit. ""He asked me to send his invitation to the Oscars. But before I did, immigration authorities released him. It was a short-lived situation,"" Pacetti said. Burnat told Moore that ""It's nothing I'm not already used to"" and ""When u live under occupation, with no rights, this is a daily occurrence,"" Moore wrote on his Twitter account. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was prohibited from discussing specific cases. In a statement, the agency said it strives to treat travelers with respect. ""Travelers may be referred for further inspection for a variety of reasons to include identity verification, intent of travel, and confirmation of admissibility,"" it said. In an interview with CNN late Wednesday, Burnat said the experience reminded him of the more than 500 Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks in the West Bank. ""The negative media and the government propaganda that they show the Palestinians as terrorists, as not human, a bad face -- this is not true and this is not real and this is what makes life difficult for Palestinians,"" Burnat said. ""It is very important for me to be attending the Oscars because this is the first time a Palestinian documentary has been nominated for the Oscars,"" he said. The title ""5 Broken Cameras"" refers to the damage to the filmmaker's equipment while documenting local resistance to encroaching Israeli settlements and the construction of an Israeli wall separating farmers from their lands and olive groves. Burnat was the only cameraman in the village, sometimes recording violent events. He was jailed and put under house arrest in 2006 ""after which, his cameras were broken,"" the film's website says. Are you cramming for Oscar Sunday? The film is told from a Palestinian perspective, though it is co-directed by Burnat's Israeli friend Guy Davidi, a filmmaker and peace activist. In the documentary, Burnat captured how the ongoing conflict influenced the life of his son, Gibreel. Burnat recorded some of his boy's first words: army, cartridge and the Arabic word for the security fence separating Israel and the West Bank. ""Our kids grow up like this, in this situation. So they open their eyes and they are facing the soldiers around the houses, in the streets. And they talk about the army and the soldiers,"" Burnat told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. In a recent interview with CNN in the West Bank, Burnat said his son has lost much of his innocence. Speaking in Arabic, Gibreel remarked to CNN's Sara Sidner about the nomination: ""The Oscar ... half should go to us and half to the Palestinian people."" Davidi said he knew his work with Burnat would be criticized. ""The minute we decided the film was going to be Emad as the main character,"" Davidi said, ""then, it was much more comfortable for me, as an Israeli, to work with Emad, because I'm helping him shape his voice and not interfering with my own voice.""

"Washington (CNN) -- With ""candor comes a measure of vulnerability."" Sonia Sotomayor wants readers to know in the first pages of her new memoir that this will be different from other books by members of the Supreme Court. The dynamic story of the first Latina to sit as a justice seeks to inspire by revealing often-painful chapters in her self-described ""extraordinary journey"": her father's early death from alcoholism; a complex, often distant relationship with her mother; growing up poor in the Bronx projects; self-doubts about her looks, brief failed marriage; and professional path. But her strengths are celebrated, too: self-reliance to the point of giving herself insulin shots at age 7, after being diagnosed with diabetes; her loyalty to a large circle of friends; and vivid pride in her Puerto Rican heritage. ""Experience has taught me you cannot value dreams according to the odds of their coming true,"" she writes in ""My Beloved World"" (Knopf/Random House). ""Their real value is in stirring within us the will to aspire. That will, wherever it finally leads, does at least move you forward."" She will speak this week in depth to CNN's Soledad O'Brien and CNN en Espanol's Juan Carlos Lopez. ____________ . The 58-year-old Sotomayor was named to the high court in 2009 after 17 years as a federal judge in New York. Her autobiography ends as she takes the bench in 1992. The narrative is often hauntingly personal: no legal analyses here. Anyone seeking to glean her views of hot-button political issues like abortion, health care reform, or same-sex marriage will be disappointed. Clarence Thomas speaks in court . Some of the most vivid recollections concern her Type 1 diabetes. Sotomayor recounts how she gave herself the shots of out necessity, with her mother gone much of the day at work, and her father's illness causing his hands to tremble. And within her from that early age was a sense of destiny she has struggled at times to shape. When young Sonia was diagnosed in 1962, the prospects of living a full life past her 40s were not good. ""I've lived most of my life inescapably aware that it is precious and finite,"" she writes. ""The reality of diabetes always lurked in the back of my mind, and early on I accepted the probability that I would die young."" In many ways she considers that decades-long awareness a ""gift""-- to persevere, grasp life at its fullest every day. She now manages her illness with ease -- at public events she has been seen giving herself needle shots, with hardly anyone noticing. Sotomayor deals candidly with death, especially her father Juan's spiral from drink, and the effect it had on Sonia's mother especially. The loving daughter recalls the bottles of booze the family later discovered hidden in ""Papi's"" bedroom, including under the mattress. Her beloved cousin Nelson's early death from AIDS is chronicled. In one amazing scene, she unwittingly drives him in his last weeks to an ""appointment."" ""He asked me to wait, so I sat in the car, parked outside the rundown tenement in Hunts Point (a neighborhood in the Bronx),"" she recalls. ""Inside he'd been scoring heroin. I wanted to kick myself -- how could anyone, let alone an assistant district attorney who'd seen everything I'd seen, be so naive. I recited that essential lesson of Papi's, simplistic but true: Good people can do bad things, make bad choices. It doesn't make them bad people."" Even Sotomayor's long smoking habit -- puffing up to three and a half packs a day -- gets the full unvarnished treatment, especially the difficulties of her quitting. ___________ . The other driving narrative in this memoir is her heritage, rich with stories of childhood visits to the island of her parents' birth. She intimately describes the sounds and smells of her Bronx neighborhood too, especially the weekly visits to her paternal grandmother Mercedes -- whom she called Abuelita -- where food, dancing, and poetry readings brought some of the happiest moments of her childhood. Pizza bomber appeal rejected . The justice says an innate awareness of larger forces around her often-chaotic childhood helped ground her, leaving the girl more trusting of her own instincts than what her once-distant mother and Catholic school education could provide. Her motto when she was in doubt: ""Listen carefully and observe until I figured things out."" Young Sonia's evident intelligence and self-determination were boosted by affirmative action, just getting a hold in American society in the early 1970s, when she began applying for college. Sotomayor admits not being fully aware of its impact in her own life at that age, but certain polar memories still leave a bad taste. A fellow Hispanic student criticized her for not being more militant about the discrimination Hispanics were facing, while a high school employee baldly questioned whether as an underprivileged minority she truly deserved to go to Princeton University. ""I felt like an alien landing in a different universe,"" she says of her early college days, relating an experience shared by many of her minority friends. ""There were vultures circling, ready to dive when we stumbled. The pressure to succeed was relentless, even if self-imposed out of fear and insecurity."" She drove herself hard to overcome that doubt, determined to prove critics wrong. ""I had been admitted to the Ivy League through a special door, and I had more ground than most to make up before I was competing with my classmates on an equal footing,"" she writes. But ""to doubt the worth of minority students' achievement when they succeed is really only to present another face of the prejudice that would deny them a chance even to try."" The young woman from the Bronx projects graduated with honors from Princeton and later Yale Law School. ____________ . Sotomayor is unmarried, has no children, and her laser focus on her work as a prosecutor, private lawyer, and later justice -- she admits somewhat sadly -- has often been at the sacrifice of greater personal growth. She concedes that her intensity and drive has initially turned off some people. Her longtime paralegal developed hives when dealing with the often-brusque new boss for the first time. Sotomayor also overheard a law firm colleague describe her as ""one tough bitch"" who would not be pushed around by adversaries. ""I was shaken to hear myself so harshly categorized,"" she recalls. ""When I'm focused intensely on work, I become oblivious to social cues, or any cues for that matter."" Seeing Justice Sotomayor on the high court, zeroing in on a lawyer's presentation at oral argument, is to witness that blend of street-smart manner, combined with a steely intellect. She does not mess around. But in private, her demeanor is another story. When talking with her in small, intimate settings, Sotomayor quickly, easily makes you the sole center of her attention, bringing a warm smile and understanding manner. Being single has also allowed her time to embrace the many dozens of relatives and colleagues -- many of them mentors -- she holds close to her, her ""familia."" ""I've always turned the families of friends into family of my own,"" she writes proudly. In her newest role, Sotomayor has become an international role model, something she admits can be affecting and overwhelming at the same time. ""My education continues on the Supreme Court as I reckon with the particular demands of the finality of review,"" in the decisions the justice and her eight colleagues issue. She ends her book, ""My highest aspiration for my work on the Court is to grow in understanding beyond what I can foresee, beyond any borders visible from this vantage.""","Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has a new memoir, ""My Beloved World""

"(CNN) -- A grand jury in Ohio has indicted suspected serial stabber Elias Abuelazam on charges of attempted murder and assault in an attack on a church janitor in Toledo. Abuelazam is suspected of stabbing 18 victims in Michigan, Virginia and Ohio. Five people were killed in the attacks, which took place from May through August. The indictment in Ohio on Friday relates to an August 7 attack in which a 59-year-old man who was taking a smoke break from his job as a church custodian was seriously wounded, police said. ""A suspect approached him asking for directions and started stabbing him for no apparent reason,"" Toledo Police Sgt. Bill Wauford said after the attack. The man suffered a punctured lung and was hospitalized for four weeks, including 15 days in an induced coma, the Toledo Blade newspaper reported. Abuelazam was arrested August 11 at Atlanta, Georgia's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport while trying to board a flight to Israel, where his mother lives, police said. In addition to the Ohio stabbing, Abuelazam is believed responsible for three attacks in Leesburg, Virginia, and the stabbing deaths of five people and the wounding of nine others in Flint, Michigan, authorities have said. He is being held in Michigan on charges of murder and assault with intent to commit murder.

"(CNN) -- A death row prisoner in Georgia has not proven his innocence, a federal court ruled, according to papers released Tuesday. Troy Davis faces execution for the killing of a Savannah, Georgia, police officer in 1989. He has always said he did not kill Officer Mark MacPhail. The Supreme Court granted a stay of execution for him two hours before he was set to die in 2008, and another federal court later granted him another stay as he fought to overturn his conviction. The Supreme Court last year ordered a lower court to look at the evidence again. But the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia has now found Davis has not exonerated himself. ""Mr. Davis vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence. ... Some of the evidence is not credible and would be disregarded by a reasonable juror. ... Other evidence that Mr. Davis brought forward is too general to provide anything more than smoke and mirrors,"" the court found. Davis can still appeal to the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, and if that fails, to the Supreme Court again. His sister, Martina Correia, said Tuesday afternoon she had not yet had a chance to discuss the decision with Davis, who is sitting on death row at Baldwin State Prison in Hardwick, Georgia. She spoke to him a couple of days ago, she said, but they did not discuss the impending decision. ""Of course, we're very disappointed,"" she said. ""Troy's innocent, so we're going to keep fighting. We're going to appeal this decision."" She said she and the lawyers were still reading the court's decision, so she wasn't prepared to discuss the next step in her brother's defense strategy. Witnesses claimed Davis, then 19, and two others were harassing a homeless man in a Burger King restaurant parking lot when the off-duty officer arrived to help the man. Witnesses testified at trial that Davis then shot MacPhail twice and fled. But since his 1991 conviction, seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted their testimony. No physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of the policeman. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens ordered a federal judge in August 2009 to ""receive testimony and make findings of fact as to whether evidence that could not have been obtained at trial clearly establishes petitioner's innocence."" Stevens, who has since retired, said the risk of putting a potentially innocent man to death ""provides adequate justification"" for another evidentiary hearing. Davis' case has had a dramatic series of ups and downs. He was granted a stay of execution by the Supreme Court two hours before he was to be put to death. A month later the justices reversed course and allowed the execution to proceed, but a federal appeals court then issued another stay. Davis filed an ""original writ of habeas corpus,"" which allowed him to bypass lower federal courts and make his appeal directly to the high court. What's unusual about Davis' case is that such action is hardly ever successful. The Supreme Court often discourages claimants from maneuvering around the lower courts whose job it is to handle such appeals. In his dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia noted that the Supreme Court had not granted similar relief ""in nearly 50 years."" In June 2009, Davis supporters delivered petitions bearing about 60,000 signatures to Chatham County, Georgia, District Attorney Larry Chisolm, calling for a new trial. Chisolm is the county's first African-American district attorney. Davis is also African-American. The Georgia Pardons and Parole Board held closed-door hearings and reinterviewed the witnesses and Davis himself in 2008. The panel decided against clemency. Prominent figures ranging from the pope to the musical group Indigo Girls have asked Georgia to grant Davis a new trial. Amnesty International has also backed a new trial for Davis. Other supporters include celebrities Susan Sarandon and Harry Belafonte; world leaders such as former President Jimmy Carter and former Archbishop Desmond Tutu; and former and current U.S. lawmakers Bob Barr, Carol Moseley Braun and John Lewis. CNN's Bill Mears and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Troy Davis's sister says she is disappointed and will keep fighting .

"(CNN) -- With the promise of coming AIDS vaccines, former President Bill Clinton urged the world's nations Monday not to give up on funding to prevent a calamity. Overall support for global AIDS efforts from donor nations flattened amid last year's global economic crisis, according to a recent analysis of 2009 funding levels from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. Clinton spoke with CNN's Becky Anderson at the International AIDS Conference in Vienna, Austria. ""If we all do this, the consequences will be calamitous and you'll spend more money later,"" Clinton said, referring to reduced donations. ""You'll start having large numbers of people dying again, you'll have more political instability, more economic collapse, and it's going to cost us more money later. So it's not only going to be a humanitarian crisis. You'll pay now or pay later. So if it's at all possible, hang in there,"" he said. After years of disappointment, researchers have finally found a potential basis for an HIV vaccine. Scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases say they have discovered three human antibodies that neutralize more than 90 percent of the current circulating HIV-1 strains. ""There is a preliminary indication that sometime in the next two to three months, we'll get some reports on vaccine tests, which are very hopeful for the quick development on a vaccine that actually works,"" Clinton said. ""Meanwhile, we know that if you start people on the medicine not when they have full-blown AIDS, but as soon as their so-called CD4 blood count drops below a certain amount, it can prevent 90 percent of AIDS,"" he said. ""That's about as good as a vaccine. It's not 100 percent, but if we could just do that, this whole epidemic would be in a different place in five years."" When asked about the affordability of such medicine in poor countries, Clinton said cost should not be an issue. ""In most places, the donors are providing this medicine,"" he said. ""You should be able to get that help right now because I have negotiated great contracts for this medicine all over the world. And if you can't, you need to get in touch with us directly, and I'll try to make sure it happens, because in any poor country, people shouldn't have to pay anything for it."" HIV/AIDS is the world's leading infectious killer, according to the World Health Organization. The disease accounted for an estimated 2 million deaths in 2008, and more than 33 million people are living with the disease worldwide. The researchers say the findings put them one step closer to their goal, and among their next steps are plans to make sure other people -- not just those infected with HIV -- can create these types of antibodies. They also want to figure out how to be able to potentially mass-produce more ""broadly neutralizing"" antibodies to block nearly all HIV strains in the future. Clinton said the United States has increased contributions to AIDS programs, but not as much as hoped. ""It's not enough, but there are serious budget constraints in the congressional process,"" he said. ""I think the president did what he thought was the best he could do."" Clinton said that money must be spent to ""make good things happen. To give people a chance to live their dreams."" ""We shouldn't be penny wise and pound foolish in an interdependent world where we worry all the time about terrorism, we worry all the time about violence,"" he said. ""When President Bush's and America's approval went way down all over the world because of the Iraq war,"" he said, ""there were three places where it didn't go down: in India, where we made a deal for peaceful nuclear cooperation; in central and eastern Europe, where we continued my policy to expand NATO; and in the 10 countries of southern and eastern Africa where PEPFAR [the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief] was concentrated and the highest AIDS rates were. ""Did they agree with President Bush's Iraq policy? No. ... They thought he and the United States cared whether their children lived or died."" Clinton said nations have many ways to help. ""I would like to see all the other countries that started their cutback a year before we did do the same kind of soul-searching and ask themselves what's going to happen,"" he said. ""I also think that since the economy's coming back, it may be that everybody should consider making clear that over a two- to three-year period, they will give three years' worth of money. ... There's a thousand ways to work this out.""","NEW: Clinton suggests how countries can help .

"(Ars Technica) -- Samsung has taken another hit from Apple in Europe, thanks to an appeals court in Germany. The court ruled on Tuesday morning that the Galaxy Tab 7.7 indeed infringes upon Apple's design patent for the iPad, and banned it from sale across the EU. The Galaxy Tab 10.1N, however, managed to make its way through the cracks, with the court allowing it to be sold in Germany. The Galaxy Tab 7.7 had already been banned from sale in Germany thanks to a decision from a lower court in late 2011. At that time, the court treated Samsung Germany as a separate entity from Samsung in Korea; the latter was able to continue selling the tablet throughout the rest of Europe. Photos surface of a large, early-2000s iPad prototype . This was reversed on Tuesday when the Duesseldorf High Court decided that Samsung Germany was instead a local branch of the Korean company, resulting in the EU-wide ban. According to a statement released by the court, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 infringes upon Apple's registered EU Community Design for the iPad. But Samsung didn't lose entirely. The appeals court also upheld a previous ruling that the Galaxy Tab 10.1N â€” the larger of Samsung's two tablets â€” had indeed been sufficiently changed from the original Tab 10.1 design, therefore differentiating it enough from the iPad. The original Tab 10.1 had been banned in Germany last year for looking too much like Apple's iPad Community Design; Samsung eventually changed the look of the front and slapped an ""N"" on the device's name, qualifying it for sale in Germany. Samsung vowed to continue fighting Apple, despite its win with the Tab 10.1N. ""Samsung is disappointed with the court's ruling. We will continue to take all available measures, including legal action, to protect our intellectual property rights and defend against Apple's claims to ensure our products remain available to consumers throughout the European Union,"" the company said in a statement.

Chinese investment in and trade with Africa have soared over the past decade, with China's lending to developing country governments and companies surpassing that of the World Bank during certain periods. The visit to Tanzania is rich in symbolism because the Tanzania-Zambia railroad, built in the 1970s, was one of China's first major infrastructure projects in Africa. During his trip, Mr Xi is expected to sign several co-operation agreements with Tanzania, including plans for a $10bn port project in Bagamoyo, Philip Marmo, Tanzania's ambassador to China, told the Chinese newspaper 21st Century Business Herald. The port, which is located north of Dar es Salaam, will be linked to a special industrial zone and function as a trade hub linking Asia and east Africa, with the state-owned China Merchants Group leading the port construction, according to Mr Marmo. Tanzania has made several natural gas discoveries in recent years and China surprised western donors when it offered to build and finance a 532km gas pipeline to link the gas deposits in the south of the country to the port in Dar es Salaam, despite the fact that there is not yet the proven gas resources to fill the pipeline and no plan to sell what little exists. Construction on that pipeline, which was funded by a $1.2bn loan from the Export-Import Bank of China, nevertheless began last year on what one observer said was ""ludicrously good"" terms, with a seven-year interest-free period before low rates come into effect over 30 years. But others cautioned it may be an expensive way to indebt Tanzania to Chinese interests. China's top diplomat for Africa said it was ""inevitable"" that Mr Xi included the continent on his first overseas trip as head of state. ""Africa's importance in our foreign policy has been rising,"" said Lu Shaye, head of the African affairs department at the Chinese foreign ministry. ""We want to strengthen our co-operation with developing countries, this is a main direction of our foreign strategy."" Mr Xi arrived in Tanzania late on Sunday, and will attend the Brics summit in South Africa on Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by a visit to the Republic of Congo on March 29-30. In a statement issued on Sunday, Mr Xi said China and Tanzania shared an ""all-weather"" friendship. ""In the nearly five decades since we have established diplomatic relations, we have built up trust and constantly supported each other,"" he said. Mr Xi is expected to give a speech on China-Africa relations later on Monday. The China Merchants Group declined to comment on whether they were involved in projects in Tanzania. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Xi is expected to sign co-operation agreements with Tanzania, including a $10bn port project .

"(The Frisky) -- I'd never been one of those girls who'd dreamt about her perfect wedding. The white wedding dress, the exorbitant costs, the fuss over a big, shiny rock -- none of it ever appealed to me. I wanted to find a lifelong partner, and a family sounded nice, too, but honestly? I never cared much about that piece of paper. So why did I just marry my boyfriend after pondering it for a mere two hours? One reason: health insurance. My now-husband is a bartender and a student whose school's insurance is exorbitant. The man hadn't gone to the doctor in years, living in fear of a major accident or illness. We had lived together for about eight months when I got a job as a reporter for a newspaper with a kick-ass medical plan. According to my job, a domestic partnership affidavit was standing in the way of my partner having awesome coverage and escaping $8000 worth of retroactive hospital bills. It was a no-brainer. Onto domestic partnership! Problem is, the state of Illinois doesn't let you get domestic partnership if you're hetero. (""If they could, no one would get married!"" the City Hall employee informed me smugly, as if 1) that fact was actually true and 2) rampant domestic partnerships would mean the end of the world.) Apparently you can't be a part of the ""system"" if you're queer, and you can't opt out of the ""system"" if you're straight. It started to seem so ridiculously arbitrary -- and unfair! Did I really have to choose between leaving my honey vulnerable to unthinkable medical costs and a measly $50 certificate? The choice was clear. We went ahead and got married. The weird thing wasn't the actual City Hall wedding (it was actually sort of fun!), it was watching people react to the news. Some were angry -- ""How could you have gotten married without me there?"" my best friend implored, crushed. Others were confused --""Really, Nona? I thought you weren't into that sorta stuff."" The Frisky:Got engaged but not really in love with man . But the most common reaction was voyeuristic elation -- from everyone, even my long-lost elementary school friends on Facebook. It was like I had become part of some coveted club, or even a higher-class citizen. I understood more than ever why gay marriage was such a big deal. I also started to get why people become so wrapped up in weddings. It's your moment. All eyes are on you. Suddenly, everybody loves you! The Frisky: Boyfriend better give me good gifts . Mine is a situation that's left me contemplating my principles. By getting insurance-married on the fly, did I ""give in"" or did I beat tradition? Maybe a little bit of both? I have nothing against weddings -- nothing's better than a celebration of love -- and if my husband and I decide to get married ""for real,"" I'm sure we'll have an epic one. But the government certificate thing has always made me indignant, especially nowadays when the health insurance crisis looms large. Why should one be able to have health insurance more easily because they happen to be heterosexual? Or, for that matter, if they believe in the institution of marriage enough to support it? The Frisky: Paris magical at Christmas . Either way, our shotgun wedding was just as much of a gesture of love as anything else. People get married for a lot worse reasons than ensuring their loved one's health, safety, and peace of mind. And at the very least, now I know my vow of ""in sickness and in health"" is backed up by a PPO insurance plan.

"(CNN) -- A lockdown at an Ohio college was lifted Friday evening, hours after school officials received a ""threat of violence,"" the college's website said. The alert began around 11:30 a.m. Friday, after a letter sent to a College of Mount St. Joseph administrator threatened violence at the Cincinnati school, according to Delhi Township Police Lt. Darryl Haussler and college spokeswoman Betheny Herr. ""That is when we took action to put the entire campus community into lockdown mode,"" Herr said. The school initiated its emergency plan -- including communicating to students, faculty and staff via Twitter, Facebook and text messages. According to a message on the school's website, the order for students, faculty and staff at the college to remain where they were went out at 12:49 p.m. Hours later, the campus was secured and the college posted on its website that ""operations are back to normal."" ""Safety is the very first priority,"" said Herr, adding that there was no evidence of violence or injuries found on the campus. Campus police will remain present to maintain safety, according to the website. The Delhi Township Police Department was among the agencies -- along with the Green Township Police Department and Hamilton County Police Association -- working with the College of Mount St. Joseph police to investigate the threat, escort people off campus and secure the campus, Haussler said. Classes will be back in session Saturday, the school said. The College of Mount St. Joseph is a Catholic liberal arts institution for 2,400 students -- 1,200 undergraduates and the rest in professional education programs -- located in Cincinnati, in southern Ohio.

"Washington (CNN) -- The split screen told the story -- when Mitt Romney was speaking, President Barack Obama was looking down; when Obama was speaking, Romney was looking at the president. ""It has killed jobs,"" Romney said during Wednesday's debate about the politically charged health care law pushed by Obama. ""Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said, will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance."" Romney looked at the crowd, moderator Jim Lehrer and even Obama during the exchange. Obama, on the other hand, looked down, shook his head and sporadically looked at his Republican adversary. Fact Check: Job creation versus unemployment . The directness in that one exchange -- which was one of many during the debate -- showed Romney was not afraid to go toe-to-toe with Obama. The former Massachusetts governor came across as direct and combative. Obama seemed removed and didn't return fire as Romney pulled no punches. Read the transcript of the debate . Facebook users, who rated the performance using the CNN grading application, described Obama as ""meek"" and ""unprepared."" A number of users who graded the president poorly mentioned that he was regularly looking down. ""I think they had the wrong strategy,"" former Obama adviser Van Jones said of his boss' campaign. ""I think he thought that he was going to go and have a conversation with the American people. I think he took Romney too lightly. I think he did not expect Romney to be able to throw that kind of heat."" ""Romney was able to out Obama Obama on the connection piece, on the authenticity piece, on being able to tell the story,"" said Jones. Analysis: Romney seizes the story . During the 2008 presidential debates against Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Obama regularly looked into the camera when he spoke and countered the attacks of his Republican challenger. That debate style directly contrasted the way Obama appeared on Wednesday in Denver. At one point, Romney directly told viewers that ""virtually everything he [President Obama] just said about my tax plan is inaccurate."" ""So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not,"" Romney said. ""I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said is, I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit."" Again, as Romney was answering, Obama seemed to be taking notes. Following Romney's statement, Obama shot back, accusing Romney of tossing out his plan before the debate. Five things we learned from the debate . ""Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is 'Nevermind.' Critics sometimes accuse the president of being too professorial and possibly too cool. Following the debate, even supporters issued that critique. ""I just got the sense that the president would have preferred to be somewhere else,"" said James Carville, a CNN contributor and former adviser to President Bill Clinton. ""President Obama came there, he wanted to have a conversation. Takes two people to have a conversation. Mitt Romney came there with a chainsaw."" At crossroads of economic crisis, debate disappoints . Carville continued with some of the same directness exhibited by Romney on Wednesday: ""The president didn't bring his 'A' game tonight."" And viewers agreed. Sixty-seven percent of registered voters who watched the debate said Romney won, while 25% said Obama came out on top, according to a CNN/ORC International Poll. ""The president just didn't seem like he wanted to debate Romney,"" said CNN's Chief National Correspondent John King. ""If he came in there thinking, 'I am ahead therefore I am going to stay above the fray,' that is a strategic mistake because he is not that far ahead."" CNN fact checks the candidates on key issues .","Democrat Van Jones: ""I think [Barack Obama] did not expect [Mitt] Romney to be able to throw that kind of heat.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to confront another high-profile challenge to affirmative action in college admissions. The justices will decide the constitutionality of a voter referendum in Michigan banning race- and sex-based discrimination or preferential treatment in public university admission decisions. The high court is currently deciding a separate challenge to admissions policies at the University of Texas, which did not involve a voter referendum. A federal appeals court last year concluded the affirmative action ban, which Michigan voters passed in a 2006 referendum, violated the U.S. Constitution's equal protection laws. Appeals court strikes down Michigan's affirmative action ban . It was the latest step in a legal and political battle over whether the state's colleges can use race and gender as a factor in choosing which students to admit. The ban's opponents say classroom diversity remains a necessary government role. ""We think this is a tremendous victory for the tens and hundreds of thousands of students who fought for affirmative action for decades,"" said Michigan attorney George Washington when the 6th Circuit ruling came out in November. He represents the By Any Means Necessary coalition that sued to overturn the ban. ""This is a tremendous day for black and Latino students in the entire country,"" Washington added. The office of Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette will defend the ban when oral arguments are held in the fall. The ban ""embodies the fundamental premise of what America is all about: equal opportunity under the law,"" Schuette said. ""Entrance to our great universities must be based upon merit."" The law was passed seven years ago with support of 58% of voters. It was added to the state's constitution, and bars publicly funded colleges from granting ""preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin."" Opinion: Keep affirmative action but reform it . That prompted a series of lawsuits and appeals from various groups. Michigan voters approved the ban after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that while Michigan universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit, they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted . The referendum effort was led by Jennifer Gratz, who was at the center of the high court case. As a white student, she was put on the waiting list for undergraduate admission to the state's largest university. She eventually attended another school, and became the lead plaintiff in a subsequent discrimination lawsuit. After the Supreme Court's 2003 decision, she began a public campaign to end racial preferences in admissions. The Michigan ban also prohibits the state from considering race and gender in public hiring and public contracting decisions. But the current high court case deals only with the college admissions portion. Efforts over decades to create a diverse classroom have been controversial. The Brown v. Board of Education high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools, but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states who initially refused to integrate. In the 1978 Bakke case, the Supreme Court ruled universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity, and that allows for the use of affirmative action. That issue involved a discrimination claim by a white man denied admission to law school. Opinion: Chief justice out to end affirmative action . The Supreme Court is now considering whether the University of Texas' admissions practices aimed at creating campus diversity violate the rights of some white applicants. Arguments were held in October and a written ruling is pending. The high court under Chief Justice John Roberts has made the issue a key part of its docket in recent years, and it could serve as a major legacy of the current conservative majority. The justices in 2007 struck down public school choice plans in Seattle and Louisville, concluding race could not be a factor in the assignment of children to schools. Those school districts had sought to use raced-based criteria to achieve diversity. The issue in recent years is whether and when affirmative action programs -- while constitutionally permissible now -- would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met. Now-retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor -- who wrote the key ruling a decade ago in the initial Michigan cases -- said, ""The court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today."" The justices are now being asked once again to decide whether Michigan's current policy meets that legal and social test. The case is Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality by Any Means Necessary (12-682). Opinion: Taking affirmative action personally .","Michigan bans race- and sex-based discrimination in university admissions .

"(CNN) -- Students and staff will be allowed to return to a northeast Ohio college campus Monday evening, following a bomb threat that had forced its evacuation earlier in the day, according to the school's website. The bomb threat had forced the evacuation of Stark State College in North   Canton, Ohio. Some classes were canceled and a building evacuated at Kent State University at Stark, which shares the campus with Stark State, according to messages posted Monday on the two schools' official websites. Separately on Monday morning, hazardous materials teams were sent to Ohio State University's main campus in Columbus after a professor received a letter containing a white powder, but no readings indicated it posed any danger, a campus police official said. The professor who received the letter is doing fine and had suffered no  harmful effects from the powder, said Campus Police Deputy Chief Richard  Morman. The hazmat crews were called to  the second floor of a physics building, according to CNN affiliate WBNS. There was no word Monday afternoon about whether the incidents at the two campuses, which are about 130 miles apart, were thought to be connected. The posting on the Stark State website said that authorities had been cleared by authorities to reopen and resume normal operations by 5 p.m. Kent State University at Stark posted a message on its official website Monday morning saying its fine arts building was closed until 5 p.m. and ordering students and campus personnel ""to evacuate the building immediately,"" but other classes and campus offices were  to remain open as scheduled.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Atlanta courthouse shooter Brian Nichols was spared a death sentence Friday after the jury deliberating his fate announced that it could not agree on a sentence. Brian Nichols was spared a death sentence after the jury in his trial announced it was deadlocked. Jurors told Superior Court Judge James Bodiford on Friday night that they were deadlocked, with nine in favor of death and three in favor of life without parole. Under Georgia law, the jurors must reach a unanimous decision in order to impose a death sentence. In the absence of a unanimous jury verdict, the decision falls in the hands of Bodiford, who will decide Saturday between a life sentence with or without the possibility of parole. Nichols, 37, was convicted last month of 54 counts for a deadly shooting rampage that began in the same courthouse where he is standing trial. Nichols shot three people at the downtown courthouse and a federal agent in Atlanta's Buckhead district before being captured in neighboring Gwinnett County. Defense lawyers said Nichols, who confessed to the killings, suffers from a mental disorder. The jurors unanimously found the necessary aggravating circumstances in the four murders, but they were split over the death penalty. If at least seven of the 12 jurors vote for death or for life in prison without parole, the judge can impose a life sentence, with or without possibility of parole. Bodiford dismissed the jury Friday night after polling each panelist and told the court to return at 8:40 a.m. ET Saturday for his sentence. After nine weeks of testimony, the jury found Nichols guilty of 54 counts, which included the four murders plus numerous aggravated assaults, carjackings and kidnappings. The shootings began in the Fulton County Courthouse, where Nichols was set to stand trial for rape. He overpowered a sheriff's deputy and took her gun before proceeding to the courtroom of Judge Rowland Barnes, killing him and court reporter Julie Ann Brandau. Sgt. Hoyt Teasley chased Nichols to outside the courthouse, where Nichols fatally shot him. Nichols killed U.S. Customs Agent David Wilhelm before he was captured about 26 hours later in a standoff with police in the apartment of a woman he took hostage in Gwinnett County. The case drew nationwide attention, in part because of the cost of Nichols' representation: about $2 million at last accounting. Nichols had attempted to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, but the Fulton County District Attorney's Office would not take the death penalty off the table.","Jury split 9-3 in favor of death, but decision must be unanimous .

So far in 2012, Sandy trails only the Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants, which earned an 8.62 in February. The year's other buzzed-about events on Facebook: . • First presidential debate: 8.18 . • Vice-presidential debate: 6.79 . • Academy Awards: 6.74 . • San Francisco Giants winning the World Series: 6.71 . • Hurricane Isaac: 5.24 . • Announcement of Rep. Paul Ryan as Gov. Mitt Romney's vice-presidential candidate: 5.21 . Facebook's data show that men and women are talking about the storm in equal numbers and that older users -- those over 55 -- are chatting more about Sandy than younger ones. People also are using Facebook to let their family and friends know that they survived the storm. As of 10 a.m. ET Tuesday, the most-shared term by U.S. users was ""We are OK."" Other top shared words and phrases included references to electrical power, damage and trees,and terms such as ""made it,"" ""safe"" and ""thankful.""

"(CNN) -- Removing a stranded U.S. minesweeper from an environmentally delicate reef off the Philippines may take until April, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported Wednesday, citing the Philippines Coast Guard. The U.S. Navy is preparing to extract the USS Guardian from the Tubbataha Reef, a Philippine national park and UNESCO World Heritage site where the 224-foot-long ship ran aground on January 17. The Navy plans to cut the 1,312-ton minesweeper into pieces and then, with the help of two contracted crane ships, lift the pieces and carry them away. Philippines Coast Guard Rear Adm. Rodolfo Isorena said Wednesday that he hopes the salvaging will begin soon so that further damage to the reef will be limited, the Philippines News Agency said. One of the crane ships has arrived in the area, about 80 miles east-southeast of Palawan Island in the Sulu Sea, and the other is on its way, the news agency reported. Navy spokesman: Reef's location misplaced on chart . The ship is estimated to have damaged about 4,000 square meters (about 43,000 square feet) of the reef, the news agency said. Various U.S. officials, including Navy Vice Adm. Scott Swift last month, have apologized to the Philippines for the incident, which the U.S. Navy and the Philippines Coast Guard are investigating. Philippine officials said last month that the country would seek compensation for reef damage. The U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, Harry Thomas Jr., assured the Philippines on Monday that the United States ""will provide appropriate compensation for damage to the reef caused by the ship."" The reef is home to a vast array of sea, air and land creatures, as well as sizable lagoons and two coral islands. About 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral can be found there, as can whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds, according to UNESCO. Originally, only the ship's bow was on the reef, but waves pushed the entire ship onto it. The ship's wood-and-fiberglass hull was penetrated, allowing a significant amount of water into the ship, the Navy said. Crews have been working to remove hazardous materials from the vessel and anything that could still be useful to the Navy. The Navy has reported no oil slicks; the ship's 15,000 gallons of diesel fuel have been removed. One of the environmental concerns is that algae will grow on dead or scarred corals, park Superintendent Angelique Songco said. ""Their presence makes it hard for other corals to regenerate as they cover the substrate,"" Songco wrote in an e-mail to CNN on Wednesday. ""We expect an increase in the incidence of grazer fish species in the area that feed on the algae. Hopefully they are hungry enough to control algae populations to enable hard corals (to) take root in the substrate. ""So you see, the balance we have been trying to maintain has been upset. For that particular area at least, coral evolution starts all over again -- but not until salvage operations are over."" The salvage operation also may hurt tourism, because it will happen at the start of the park's main tourism window of March to early June, Songco said. Songco said she hasn't heard of any pre-booked tourists canceling. But the park, which is celebrating its 25th year, will have to close two of its 15 major diving sites during the operation, she said. ""We will not (be) able to offer divers the full measure of the Tubbataha experience,"" she said.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's top court Thursday sentenced a leading Bollywood star, Sanjay Dutt, to five years in prison in connection with bomb attacks in Mumbai in 1993. The supreme court in New Delhi upheld his conviction on charges of possessing illegal weapons tied to the bombings, which killed 257 people and wounded hundreds more. He has four weeks to surrender, said his lawyer, Satish Maneshinde. In 2006, Dutt was convicted of illegally possessing an AK-56 rifle and a 9 mm pistol under India's Arms Act. He was cleared of a more serious accusation of conspiracy in the attacks. Dutt was later sentenced to six years in prison. He served 18 months in jail before he was granted bail. ""We will await a copy of the judgment of the supreme court. ... Once that is available, we'll advise Sanjay Dutt as to how to go about (this). And it is unfortunate that this has happened,"" Maneshinde said after Thursday's verdict. He said his client would abide by the ruling. ""He will have to serve another 3Â½ years, (which are left after having spent 18 months in jail already)"" Maneshinde added. Dutt's case involves the country's deadliest string of attacks, which were believed to have been carried out by a local underworld in revenge for the demolition of a 16th-century mosque in northern India by Hindu nationalists. The mosque's destruction unleashed a wave of violence that left hundreds dead. In his defense, the actor has said the weapons were meant to protect his family. An immensely popular Bollywood celebrity, Dutt is son of a star couple: the late actors Sunil and Nargis Dutt. His sister, Priya Dutt, is a member of India's parliament. Sanjay Dutt's biggest hits included the two funny Munnabhai films, in which he played a reformed goon and an advocate of Mahatma Gandhi's principles of nonviolence. In its ruling Thursday, the supreme court also upheld the death sentence of one of the main convicts in the case. Ten other people on death row had their sentences commuted to life in jail, a defense lawyer, Sriprakash Sinha, told reporters.","India's top court sentences Sanjay Dutt to five years in prison .

"(CNN) -- Seven hundred thousand sandbags guarded the city of Fargo, North Dakota, Friday, lumpy and forlorn sentinels against the rising waters of the Red River. With the river at 17 feet above its flood stage, residents hoped they had done enough to protect themselves. ""The river is definitely well over its banks and has gone into adjacent city parks, different areas that are noncritical, not people's backyards, or businesses or anything like that,"" said Fargo spokeswoman Robyn Litke. The river stood at 35.5 feet Friday afternoon, and rising by about an inch an hour. The river is expected to crest this weekend, about three feet below last year's record flood level of 40.8 feet. Residents in Fargo and across the river in Moorhead, Minnesota, said they were optimistic after filling more than a million sandbags between the two cities and stacking most of them. ""We're in good shape and we have a lot of things in place in case there are any problems,"" Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said. The city said Friday that the levees to the north and south of Fargo have been completed. ""Residents are asked to be vigilant and monitor their dikes,"" the city said in an e-mail. Eight ""quick reaction"" National Guard teams are in the city and in surrounding Cass County, filling 50 one-ton sandbags for larger protection projects, such as potentially broken dikes, on Friday, the city said. Chinook helicopters are also available to transport bags and equipment if necessary, the city said. ""We got done what we wanted to do as far as our goals for the flood of 2010 so we're in good shape today,"" Walaker said Thursday. But still parts of Fargo were flooding Friday, city officials said. The annual flooding began last week when warmer weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead causing the Red River to swell. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, pushing water back toward the two cities. In the rural town of Hickson, about 15 miles south of Fargo, some homes in the area have been surrounded by water, and residents have had to used boats to get around. Some residents parked their cars blocks away from their homes, walking to the edge of the river where they have their boats parked. iReport: Are you there? Share photos, video . Blain Johnson, 21, rowed home in waters that he estimated were 5 feet deep. ""This used to be a horse pasture below us,"" Johnson said. Johnson said this is the fourth time his neighborhood has been inundated with water in the 10 years he has lived here.

"(CNN) -- No amount of money can make up for the loss of a loved one. But it does more for the survivors than just kind words, said the attorney handling compensation to victims after the Aurora, Colorado massacre. Families of those killed and some of the victims wounded in a shooting spree at a movie theater in Aurora in July, will soon receive payments from a charitable fund set up on their behalf, the Colorado governor's office said Friday. The Aurora Victim Relief Fund has announced how the $5,338,360.32 collected from donors will be distributed to those who suffered death or serious injury. Ken Feinberg, the fund's special master, has a history of handling similar disbursements to victims of headline-making crimes and disasters. Colorado shooting charity responds to criticism from victims' families . Since having determined similar payments to victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, he has been called on to use his judgment to divide compensation among victims in the Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse cases for Penn State and in the wake of BP oil spill. ""I think the previous funds worked,"" Feinberg told CNN in September when he was selected to manage the Aurora payouts. ""I think that success sort of breeds repeat performance in these rare situations, where compensation is ready to be distributed to innocent victims."" It's never an easy decision to make under the shadow of a catastrophic loss, Feinberg has said. He has written a book about his experiences titled ""Who Gets What."" But the attorney's work in the aftermath of the Virginia Tech massacre of 2007, when a gunman took 32 lives in a shooting rampage on a college campus provided valuable experience in laying down the compensation in the Aurora case. ""The families of the deceased (in the VT massacre) all got the same amount and the physically injured were paid based on how long they were in the hospital."" Of the 57 claims filed after the Aurora shooting, Feinberg approved 38. ""Nineteen claims were denied because they did not qualify under previously announced protocols,"" according to a statement release by the office of Gov. John Hickenlooper. Judge denies victims access to Aurora theater rampage documents . Families of the 12 who died and five victims ""who suffered permanent brain damage or permanent physical paralysis, will each receive $220,000. Six who were hospitalized for at least 20 days will receive $160,000. Thirteen more will receive $35,000 each, having been in hospital for one to seven days. Two others who were hospitalized for between eight and 19 days will each receive $91,680. Victims who did not require overnight hospital treatment will not be compensated ""due to the limited amount of money in the fund."" Free counseling is available to all victims. The Aurora Victim Relief Fund was established by Colorado's governor and a local charity called the Community First Foundation. It was established to meet the immediate and long-term needs of victims and their families. James Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student, allegedly barged into the theater on July 20 and opened fire on the audience as it watched ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" killing 12 people. He faces 152 charges, including murder and weapons offenses. Fifty-eight people were injured in the shooting. Feinberg received no compensation for his work on the Aurora shooting payments, Hickenlooper's office said. He was not even reimbursed for expenses.

"(CNN) -- The son of Mexico drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman was arrested in western Mexico on Thursday, officials said. Alfredo Guzman Salazar was arrested in Jalisco state, the Mexican navy said in a statement. Just this month, Guzman Salazar was added to the U.S. Treasury Department's kingpin list. The department's designation freezes any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits financial and commercial transactions with him. ""We congratulate the government of Mexico and the Calderon administration on another victory against the ruthless cartels,"" said U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Rusty Payne. ""This is the first step in bringing another ruthless drug baron to justice."" El Chapo, who oversees the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel, is considered the most wanted man in Mexico. Guzman Salazar was indicted in Illinois, together with his father, on various drug trafficking charges in August 2009. The arrest of El Chapo's son comes less than two weeks before Mexico's presidential elections. According to a U.S. law enforcement official, the DEA was on the scene for the arrest and assisted the Mexican navy with intelligence to help locate Guzman Salazar. CNN's Carol Cratty and CNNMexico contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. official says DEA was at the scene and helped with intelligence .
