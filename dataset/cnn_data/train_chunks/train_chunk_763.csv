A new cash-for-questions scandal threatened to engulf Parliament last night after Tory MP Patrick Mercer was snared in a sting operation. Mr Mercer resigned his party’s whip after he was exposed as having accepted £4,000 to ask Parliamentary questions and lobby on behalf of Fiji. His resignation came as pictures . emerged allegedly showing him signing a contract with a fake lobbying . company set up by journalists. Patrick Mercer MP has resigned as images of him meeting an undercover BBC Panorama reporter posing as a lobbyist were released . The MP allegedly signs a contract with the fake lobbying company set up by BBC Panorama . As the MP signs the contract he is recorded saying: 'Let's sign this, with pleasure.' Stills . from film footage released by BBC Panorama reportedly show the Newark . MP signing a document during a meeting with an undercover journalist . posing as a lobbyist. He was also recorded saying 'Let's sign this, with pleasure'. The MP for Newark announced that he . will refer himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and . will quit the Commons at the next election. But fellow Conservatives and . campaigners called for him to resign now. Last night several other MPs and peers were said to be embroiled in the scandal. Mr Mercer is accused of breaking . Commons rules by failing to declare the £4,000 payment to the . Parliamentary authorities in the register of interests. He was exposed in a sting operation run by the BBC’s Panorama programme and a national newspaper. They approached him seven weeks ago . pretending to be from firm called Alistair Andrews Communications . lobbying on behalf of Fiji. The fake company website that was used by BBC Panorama to contact Patrick Mercer . They requested his help to win . readmission to the Commonwealth for the Pacific island, which was . suspended in 2006 after its government was ousted by a military coup. Friends of former Army officer Mr . Mercer say he was approached as he has often spoken up on behalf of . Fijians in the British Army, and because he ‘looked like an easy mark’. David Cameron faced pressure last night following the Mercer scandal to bring in a right of recall so voters can sack their MPs between elections. Tory MPs and campaigners said the powers – promised in the Coalition Agreement – are needed to oust those guilty of wrongdoing. They also urged ministers to set up a long-promised register of lobbyists. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Mr Mercer’s constituents should have the right to hold him to account for his actions if they feel he has let them down. 'Without a proper right of recall, MPs remain able to sit out a full five-year term, regardless of their conduct.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell, an advocate of recall votes, said that Mr Cameron’s Policy Unit ‘needs to come up with proposals fast’. In February 2010, Mr Cameron called lobbying ‘the next big scandal waiting to happen’. But Coalition pledges to set up a register of lobbyists have so far come to naught. The MP signed a contract worth £2,000 . a month and put down five Parliamentary questions on Fiji, all of which . were answered. He should have declared an interest, but did not. On March 26 he also proposed a . Commons Early Day motion saying ‘there is no justification for Fiji’s . continued suspension from the Commonwealth’ and urged the Government ‘to . arrange a ministerial visit in order to help prepare for and assist its . readmission’. He was in the process of setting up an All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fiji. The scandal is reminiscent of the . cash-for-questions affair in the 1990s when two Tory MPs accepted money . in brown paper bags to ask Parliamentary questions. The affair left the . Conservative Party tainted with ‘sleaze’ for a decade. Jon Trickett MP, Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: 'David Cameron must now address his failure to act by working with Labour to establish a Statutory Register of Lobbyists. 'We have seen no action from this Tory-led Government, despite David Cameron himself warning that lobbying was the next great scandal waiting to happen. 'The coalition agreement promised action, and cross-party support was offered. However, scandals around ""cash for access"" continue to be present at the heart of this Government. 'At a time when faith in politics and politicians is at an all time low, we must all be working hard to reinstate confidence in elected representatives and the governmental system. 'Examples such as the allegations heard in the last 24 hours are not good for British politics.' In a bid to stop the rot, Mr Mercer . referred himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, said . he would be resigning the Tory whip for the good of his party and . announced he would not stand for re-election in 2015. But last night it appeared that the . scandal was spreading. The BBC announced that they had put allegations . of wrongdoing to other MPs and peers. Newark MP Patrick Mercer today quit the Tory party, after 12 years on the Conservative benches in the Commons . Prime Minister David Cameron has been made 'aware' of he allegations while on holiday in Ibiza with wife Samantha . At least 20 are required to create an . all-party group and Labour whips in the House of Lords warned their . peers a week ago that a lobbying sting was in operation. The resignation was a mixed blessing . for David Cameron. Mr Mercer, the former commanding officer of the . Sherwood Foresters regiment, has been one of the Prime Minister’s . fiercest internal critics since he was sacked as homeland security . spokesman in 2007 after he said being called a ‘black b*****d’ was a . normal part of Army life. Patrick Mercer spent 25 years as an army officer with the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters, serving in Northern Ireland, Uganda, Bosnia and Canada. As the youngest colonel since the Second World War he left the army in 1999 and soon after joined BBC Radio 4's Today programme as their defence reporter. He was elected as Tory MP for Newark in 2001, and served on the frontbench under Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard and David Cameron. But he was sacked by Mr Cameron in 2007 for an interview in which he suggested that being called a . 'black b*****d' was a normal part of army life. He also claimed to have met a lot of 'idle and useless' soldiers from ethnic minorities. Since then, Mr Mercer has been an outspoken critic of the Tory leader. In 2011 he was reported to have called Mr Cameron 'an a***' and 'a despicable creature without any real redeeming features'. A recording obtained by The People . newspaper suggested he also said of the PM: 'I’ve never, ever come . across anyone less suited to the job in my life. I would take a beggar . off the streets and put him in that position rather than have Cameron. I . loathe him.' However, Mr Mercer denied the veracity of the account and accused the newspaper of subterfuge. Since then, Mr Mercer has been . accused of describing Mr Cameron as a ‘despicable creature without any . real redeeming features’. Asked once what the Prime Minister’s biggest . fault was, Mr Mercer responded: ‘Being born.’ But if Mr Mercer is forced to resign . as an MP, Mr Cameron would be presented with a potentially disastrous . by-election in an area where the UK Independence Party would fancy its . chances of picking up its first Westminster seat. The Prime Minister will also face . questions about why the Coalition has failed to fulfil pledges to create . a state register of lobbyists and to give voters the right to ‘recall’ MPs who have done wrong. Critics called for Mr Mercer to retire. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted: ‘If . it’s bad enough for you to resign from your party, how can it be OK to . continue representing constituents at all?’ TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive . Matthew Sinclair said: ‘Newark residents will be intrigued as to why . their MP has resigned from his party but not from Parliament.’ Friends of Mr Mercer said that he had . not put down the exact Parliamentary questions he had been asked to, . but had chosen the wording himself. They also claimed he had refused a . request to ‘cook the results’ of the All-Party Group report on Fiji in . order to fix the conclusions. ‘They tried to force his hand and he said . No,’ one friend added. Allies said accusations that Mr Mercer had also . made derogatory comments about Fijian soldiers were ‘rubbish’. Mr Mercer was approached by Snapper . TV, a freelance documentary maker working for Panorama, on Tuesday. He . discussed the affair with Tory Chief Whip Sir George Young on Thursday . and suggested to party chiefs that he resign. Mr Mercer, who is married with a son, . said: ‘Panorama are planning to broadcast a programme alleging that I . have broken Parliamentary rules. 'I am taking legal advice about these . allegations – and I have referred myself to the Parliamentary . Commissioner for Standards. ‘In the meantime, to save my party . embarrassment, I have resigned the Conservative Whip. I have also . decided not to stand at the next General Election.’ David Cameron was informed of the situation while on holiday in Ibiza. His spokesman said: ‘Patrick Mercer . has done the right thing in referring himself to the Parliamentary . Commissioner for Standards and resigning the whip.’","Allegedly caught breaking rules by reporters posing as lobbyists who asked him to carry out work on behalf of Fiji .

"By . Fiona Macrae . PUBLISHED: . 18:31 EST, 10 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:46 EST, 11 July 2013 . Healthier: A study has shown that men and women in their 90s are sharper today than those who reached the same age a decade ago . If you seem to be spending more and more time fretting about your pension, here’s something to cheer you up. Not only are we living longer, we are also getting wiser. An authoritative study found that men and women in their 90s today are mentally sharper than those who reached the same age ten years earlier. They also find the physical challenges of day-to-day-life easier. The research, published in the Lancet Medical Journal, contradicts the perception that a longer old age will inevitably bring with it more ill health. The Danish researchers said: ‘If this development continues, the future functional problems and care needs of very elderly people might be less than are anticipated.’ In other words, we may be able to look forward to a long and healthy old age. Professor Kaare Christensen, of the University of Southern Denmark, analysed data on two large groups of Danes. One set was born in 1905, and the other in 1915. When they reached their mid-90s they were put through a battery of mental and physical tests, designed to assess factors including memory, grip strength and how easy they found it to walk outside. Those born in 1915 were two years older when they were tested – yet did better. Not only were they mentally sharper, but they also found day-to-day life easier. And a memory test used to diagnose Alzheimer’s also posed fewer problems for the 90-somethings born later. The researchers said the difference could not simply be attributed to improvements in education. Sharper: A memory test used to diagnose Alzheimer¿s also posed fewer problems for the 90-somethings born later . Instead, they believe brain power has been boosted by a variety of factors, including better medical care, improved living conditions, healthier diet and greater intellectual stimulation. Those born later may also be benefiting from better mobility aids, including ramps and walking frames. Professor Christensen said: ‘The study challenges speculations that the improving longevity is the result of the survival of very frail and disabled elderly people. ‘Our results suggest that the functioning of people who reach their 90s is improving in Denmark, and increasing longevity associated with improved living conditions and healthcare may result in not just longer lives, but also that the elderly are functioning better for longer than in earlier generations.’ In an accompanying article, experts in geriatric medicine from the Radboud University Medical Centre in Holland agreed. They said: ‘The expectation of a continuing sharp rise in dementia prevalence in populations older than 80 or 90 years plays an important part in the alarming predictions about the future global burden of dementia. ‘But the evidence for improved cognition at very old age provided by Christensen and colleagues challenges [this].’ But there is one note of caution. Professor Christensen said more research is needed to confirm that his findings apply outside Denmark.","Research contradicts the notion that a longer old age brings more ill health .

Death: Sophie was rushed to hospital on Tuesday evening but could not be saved . Toxicology reports into Sophie's death last night revealed that she had ingested methadone before she died. Although it has not been established whether it killed her, officers continue to investigate the possibility. The detective leading the investigation said that the drug could not be found in the home and called for it to be returned by anyone who may have taken it away. Jones and King were charged last night with causing or allowing the death of a child by means of an unlawful act. They were remanded in custody ahead of an appearance at Blackpool Magistrates' Court.

Gone: Neighbours and friends flocked to Sophie's home to leave tributes to the toddler . At a press conference yesterday, Detective Superintendent Paul Withers called for a container methadone, which is suspected to have been taken from Sophie's home, to be returned. He said: 'We are extremely concerned that a substance may have been removed from the address on Jameson Street either before or shortly after the arrival of paramedics. 'We believe this substance to be methadone and we believe it may have been given to a friend or an associate of the detained persons or hidden in the area near Jameson Street. 'I would like to appeal to the friends and associates of the detained persons, if they know where this methadone is, please ring 101 and help us to recover this substance safely. 'Clearly, if it is found in the area, it can be extremely dangerous and I would urge the public to contact us. 'The cause of death at this time is unascertained and we will not know the cause of Sophie's death until we have the results of the toxicology examinations.' Two nights ago the pair who were arrested made a secret midnight visit to a hospital mortuary to view the body of a two-year-old-child, who had not been identified. Three unmarked police cars made the trip from Blackpool Central police station in unmarked constabulary cars for the three mile trip to the town's Victoria Hospital. One of the investigation team said: 'The female, in particular, has made repeated requests to see the little girl.The two went separately to the mortuary. 'It is unusual but the decision to go ahead was made by a senior officer.' 'Angel': Sophie was taken to hospital late on Tuesday but she could not be saved . Neighbours have spoken of their shock over the death. Sacha Borrie, 28, said: 'I think it's just a tragic accident. Unfortunately, you can't turn the clocks back.' Ms Borrie, who was at home when emergency services arrived at the house, said: 'I was sat in the living room and then saw these blue lights and all this noise coming from the street. 'I looked out the window and I saw little Sophie being carried into the ambulance. Ms Borrie described Sophie as 'a real sweetheart'. She said: 'Sophie was as good as gold and she was a happy child. 'She'd come round with her mum and sit and play in my living room. I burst into tears when I heard what had happened. 'She was a gorgeous girl, a beautiful, happy little angel. She had a great little personality.' Lindsey Holehouse, 21, who lives on the street with her two-year-old daughter, said: 'I feel so sorry for that little girl. Everyone round here is so shocked.' Flowers, cards and teddy bears left outside the home as a tribute to the 'beautiful princess'. One card said: 'Princess Sophie, you are now a pretty angel. Spread your wings and fly'.

Teachers have to spend months ‘socialising’ children when they start primary school in how eat, mix with other pupils and go to the toilet, an education minister has warned. Growing numbers of youngsters start school aged four with ‘very challenging social skills’, Lord Nash said. Eight in 10 staff at nurseries and primary schools say they have had to deal with children who have wet or soiled themselves. Teachers and classroom assistants have to spend several terms teaching youngsters in how to mix with other children, Lord Nash claimed (file picture) All four to seven-year-olds in England will be given free school lunches from September as part of moves to improve the eating habits of new pupils. Lord Nash, the minister for schools, said teachers and classroom assistant, were now spending ‘several terms’ helping children from chaotic families to adapt to school life. Lord Nash said: ‘We unfortunately see an increasing number of pupils entering primary school with very challenging social skills. ‘Primary teachers and assistants have to spend several terms socialising them. Lord Nash, the Schools Minister, said pupils teachers were having to deal with more pupils with 'challenging social skills' ‘Meals are very important, which is why we have introduced compulsory meals.’ He . said the government was investing ‘substantially’ in early years . training and would continue to support childminders in particular in . helping to prepare children to start school. Last month a survey by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers found school support staff were increasingly having to deal with pupils who have not been toilet trained by the age of four. Lord Nash was responding to a question in the House of Lords from Labour peer Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe who asked for the government to produce statistics on ‘the number of children who are now going to school who cannot eat properly, have not been toilet trained properly and cannot cope with healthy foods by comparison with what they are accustomed to eating’. He also asked what the Government is doing to ‘help parents to train those children to make sure that they have a better standard and to stop the closure of the Sure Start centres, which were aimed at trying to prevent that difficulty’. Teaching leaders warn the problem of pupils who are do not know how to go to the toilet or feed themselves was adding to the workload of staff. Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL, said last month: 'Having to deal with increasing numbers of pupils who have not yet been toilet trained puts extra pressure on education staff when they already have enough pressure on them. 'It is worrying that such a high number of support staff have received no training in dealing with such issues, yet they are expected to deal with pupils, and even though it is not formally within their job description.' Labour peer Lord Brooke claimed many children who start school cannot eat properly (file picture) Dr Bousted added: 'Schools need to give staff clear . guidance on how to deal with toileting accidents so they know what they . are allowed to do and who should be dealing with an incident. 'It . is also important that education staff feel they have support from . their school nurse or head, and that they know where to obtain guidance . should they need it.' A survey published by ATL in 2012 found that almost two-thirds of primary school staff say they have seen an increase in youngsters having accidents during the school day over the past five years. This figure rose to 71 per cent among teachers working with three to five-year-olds.","Lord Nash said it can take several terms for pupils to learn how to behave .

A 17-year-old girl has found herself at the centre of an internet storm after web users shared explicit photographs of her giving oral sex to two men at an Eminem concert in Ireland. Police are investigating the disturbing incident amid concerns that the images - apparently taken in a public area of the concert site and now widely circulating on the internet - amount to child pornography because she is under 18. And dozens of internet commenters have been accused of sexism for mocking the girl and seeking to reveal her identity - while praising her sexual partner as a 'hero' and a 'legend'. Campaigners have warned that the sharing of explicit pictures is a 'growing problem' which it is almost impossible to prevent due to the fast-moving nature of social networking. Twitter row: There is no suggestion that the man who she was photographed performing a sex act on at Slane Castle, in Ireland, assaulted her . The photograph of the schoolgirl . performing oral sex on a grinning man wearing a green hat was taken in . the grounds of Slane Castle on Saturday evening. She was also pictured kissing the same man while he sexually touched her, and giving oral sex to a different man on the same night. American rapper Eminem was performing to a crowd of 80,000, with police making 63 arrests during the event. Many of the Twitter and Instagram . accounts which shared the pictures of the girl have been shut down, as . has a 'slut-shaming' Facebook page which made fun of the incident. But . the concert achieved web notoriety the next day when the explicit . pictures were widely circulated. Many . internet users were quick to condemn her behaviour - Bridget Moynihan . tweeted that the girl 'has only herself to blame, out in the open . surrounded by people with camera phones. What did she expect.' Users of web forums revealed the identity of the teenager, a secondary school student from the west of Ireland. Others shared images mocking the girl and implying that she was overly sexually promiscuous. Encounter: The teenager was pictured kissing the man in a green hat at the same festival . It was reported that the person originally responsible for posting the pictures online was a man from Belfast. After the girl's rise to fame, she was apparently left extremely distressed and embarrassed. She is currently in hospital, and is believed to have been sedated. 'This . is a very sensitive matter and the girl's family are distraught,' a . source told the Irish Sun. 'This is so out of character for her. She's . currently very emotional and confused about the whole thing.' Police are currently investigating . the matter, and are looking into who shared the original photos and . whether they constitute child pornography. A police spokesman said: 'Gardai are . aware of the incident and are inquiring into the matter. Gardai have . spoken to the female involved and it would be inappropriate for us to . comment any further.' The concerts at Slane Castle, which take . place every year and are considered among the highlights of the Irish . musical calendar, are organised by Lord Conyngham, who lives at the . castle and is known as the 'rock 'n' roll aristocrat', and promoted by . MDC Productions. Venue: The photograph was taken in the grounds of Slane Castle, in County Meath in Ireland . Social networks have asked users to . report the images as quickly as possible so that they can be spotted and . removed by site moderators, who have been instructed to remain . extra-vigilant in looking out for the images from Slane Castle. A . Twitter spokesman said: 'Protecting people's experience on Twitter is . very important and we have a clear set of rules that outline what is and . isn't acceptable behaviour on the platform. 'If . people come across content that may violate our policies, we encourage . them to report it so we can quickly follow up, rather than tweet or . retweet images and links.' A . spokesman for Facebook said: 'At Facebook we take safety incredibly . seriously, and have worked hard for years to develop clear rules and . powerful reporting tools that enable people to easily report things that . make them uncomfortable. We have built a large and highly trained team . of safety experts who review these reports and take action, including . escalating serious cases to the police. 'Unfortunately, . there will always be a tiny number of malicious people who are intent . on harming others, online and offline. It is difficult to prevent this . minority from behaving in this way â€“ but once they do we will work hard . to remove them from Facebook and make sure they are brought to justice.' Cyber-bullying campaigners warned . that this type of incident is increasingly common, especially as web . users aim to damage the reputation of people they know by spreading . photographs of them in compromising positions. Gig: The incident took place on Saturday during a concert by American rapper Eminem . 'This . particular problem is a big one, and it is growing,' said Scott . Freeman, founder of charity Cybersmile. 'With the power of the internet, . this is one example of how its immediate reach can cause huge . destruction. 'It's almost impossible to protect against it, because anyone can take a picture of anyone and share it.' He . said that websites and internet service providers have a duty to crack . down on this type of harmful content, adding: 'If anyone finds . themselves in this situation, they need to contact ISPs and website . moderators to get the content removed.' Last night ClÃ­ona SaidlÃ©ar, policy and communications director with Rape Crisis Network Ireland, said the people who filmed the incident and shared it should be ashamed. Ian Power, communications manager with youth group Spunout, said that the pictures should never have been posted online. 'This is content which should never have been recorded, let alone placed on the internet,' he told the Irish Daily Mail. 'Everyone has made mistakes in their lives, but not everyone has had it so horrifically documented in such a mortifying way. The conversation online has been overwhelming misogynistic also. Some people seem to be regarding this as funny, or banter, when it is not.' Jackie O'Callaghan of the National Parents' Council said that the incident has left many parents worried about their children when attending concerts such as the one at Slane. 'As a parent, hearing about this did make me worry, of course, and it would worry other parents,' she said. Victim: Hannah Smith killed herself this month after receiving abuse from trolls on social network Ask.fm . Despite the widespread condemnation of the girl, very little criticism has been made of the unidentified men featured in the photographs. Twitter user Conor McCullagh wrote: 'What about the hero who was with [the girl], now he deserves a medal.' However, others took to the internet to criticise the apparent double standards. @zintendo wrote on Twitter: 'Cute that everyone is talking about [the girl], nobody is judging the guy. #yourmisogynyisshowing'. Journalist Sarah Ditum wrote on the New Statesman website that the man was considered just 'a bystander' while 'people tried to use the pictures to shame, trash and demolish a young woman'. The alleged misogyny comes in the wake of complaints from prominent women, including MPs, that they have been the subject of vile threats delivered via Twitter by anonymous trolls. A British teenager, Hannah Smith, killed herself earlier this month after being mercilessly bullied by trolls on social network Ask.fm, leading to calls for greater action over online abuse.

But the retired toy maker has decided to let go of his entire tin plate fleet in one of Gloucestershire-based Cotswold Auctions' biggest ever sales after his worsening multiple sclerosis made holding his cherished collectables impossible. Value: Experts believe the simple toys, which were bought for just a few pounds each, could fetch several thousand pounds when they go under the hammer next month . Kapow: This Japanese tinplate Batmobile is up for sale for an estimated £50-£80, along with a boxed German satellite vehicle and a boxed Luxe car . Original: The Japanese Batmobile toy is based on this version from the 1960s TV series. This Batmobile was a modified version of the 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car . Riding: A Chinese-made police officer on a motorcycle. Mr Findlater says he collected the tin plate toys for 30 or 40 years, admitting he 'got a bit obsessive' Protected: These Japanese-built tin racing cars are being sold still inside the plastic bags they originally came in. Mr Findlater said he acquired his toys all over the world . Gained: This 1931 tinplate model gunboat from Paya in Spain is predicted to sell for between £30 and £40 at Cotswold Auctions . New home: These modern Chinese-made table tennis players are being sold along with three clockwork robots for between £20.00 and £40.00. Mr Findlater says the toys would often sit untouched in shops for years until he bought them . Vintage: These cars from the 1990s were build by Maisto. They are just some of the 2,000 tin plate items being put up for auction by Arthur Findlater . Cherished: The collection is one of the biggest ever sold by Gloucestershire-based Cotswold Auctions. It will be held at Bingham Hall in Cirencester on March 7 at 10am . This Japanese Harley Davidson toy is one of three in Arthur Findlater's huge collection. Each one is estimated to sell for £20 to £30 . This Chinese tin plate 'Roxy Robot' (centre) and two smaller 'Goldman' robots are part of a joint lot that is estimated to sell for between £20 and £40 . Boxed: Retired toy maker Arthur Findlater has decided to sell his entire collection after his worsening multiple sclerosis made holding the metal treasures impossible . Mr Findlater said he purchased many of the toys directly from factories. 'I used to buy them by the metre, many at a time that were broken, but they only had very small faults and they could be fixed,' he said . This German wind-up duck riding a bicycle is being sold alongside similar figures: a boxed clockwork ice cream vendor, a Chinese-made wind-up snail, a clockwork ice cream vendor and two wind-up mice. The mini-collection is predicted to sell for £40 . These widely-collected Victor and Sutcliffe tin boats and submarines from the 1930s are expected to fetch £80 each . Auctioneer Lindsey Braune said: 'It's not every day that we're asked to sell a single collection of more than 2,000 pieces, so we're exited and delighted to do it...

Alastair Cook getting out  to loose, almost reckless shots when survival . was the height of ambition said everything about the sorry state . England found themselves in at the end of a Test series they should have . dominated. England’s most prolific and . single-minded batsmen are usually  perfect for a crisis. But their . departures on the fourth evening of this final, decisive Test in the . face of a mountainous target looked to have made this a case of one . survival battle too many. England went into the final day at . Eden Park perilously placed at 90 for four. They were chasing a  nominal . 481 for victory but needing a rescue act beyond even those that saw . them draw Tests against the odds in recent times at Centurion, Cape . Town, Cardiff and, in this series, Dunedin. Batting coach Graham Gooch, who has pretty much seen it all, admitted that England may have underestimated New Zealand. ‘I think it’s a great reality check . that you can’t take any team lightly and can’t play people on what it . says in the rankings, or on a piece of paper,’ said Gooch after the . fourth day. ‘You have to play good cricket to compete and in two of the . three matches so far, New Zealand have been in the ascendancy. ‘Our performance has not been up to . the standards we’ve produced on a consistent basis so we’ll have to look . at that, yes. But I wouldn’t say we took them lightly after the  first . match, when New Zealand  dominated the game. They’ve  outbowled and . outbatted us so far.’ The big one: England captain Alastair Cook leaves the field after scoring 43 during day four of the third Test . Close catchers: Alastair Cook bats as his Kiwi counterpart McCullum deploys his men around the bat . Bad Trott: England's No 3 traipses off after being caught behind chasing a wide one in the evening session . Nick's nicked one: England's Compton (right) heads for the pavilion after being caught by New Zealand's wicketkeeper BJ Watling for two . What makes this so hard to take is . that New Zealand, the world’s eighth-ranked team, lost seven of their . eight Tests prior to this series and endured an internal crisis over . Ross Taylor’s removal as captain which was every bit as damaging as the . Kevin Pietersen affair. Yet they went into the final day as . hot favourites to wrap up only their fourth Test series triumph over . England and their first against  anybody other than Zimbabwe and . Bangladesh since 2006, when they defeated West Indies. The first session of day four summed . up this Test and the whole sorry series for England. They were dreadful. They lacked ideas, imagination and, frankly, leadership as New Zealand . moved into a position from which history tells you they could not . possibly lose this Test. So bad were England before lunch that . New Zealand, who began the day at 35 for three and under a smidgen of . pressure, were able to score freely and aggressively to rack up 141 in . the session for the loss of Dean Brownlie. It was witless, hopeless . cricket from England, notable for the petulance of Stuart Broad in . berating his fielders and the apparent lack of anything resembling . tactical nous. Job well done: Brendon McCullum applauds his team-mates at the close of a very successful day for the hosts . Double up: Fulton is applauded off on the day he completed his second century of the Test match . The biggest recipient of England’s . largesse was Peter Fulton, a  cricketing journeyman who was expected to . be little more than a walking wicket in this series after a four-year . absence from the five-day game. Instead, he became only the fourth New . Zealander, after Glenn Turner, Geoff Howarth and Andrew Jones, to score . two centuries in the same Test. New Zealand started the fourth day . with a lead of 274 but by  the time Fulton and Brendon  McCullum, with . yet another half-century, had completed their stand of 117 in only 16.5 . overs, the Test was out of England’s reach barring a recovery of . historic proportions. Monty Panesar, who had started the day . by taking Brownlie’s wicket thanks to an excellent catch from Ian Bell . and bowled four maidens on the trot, was then destroyed to the tune of . 52 runs in his next five overs. Centurion: Fulton celebrates his mean feat with a simple wave of the bat to the sparse Auckland crowd . Proud parents: Wendy and Gordon Fulton watch their son Peter score a century on day four . Fulton, vulnerable outside  off stump, . was allowed to indulge his love of the leg side, seemingly dispatching . Panesar over the short, straight boundary at will. It was when Fulton . brought up his hundred with another straight six, off Broad, that the . game was up. McCullum, a combative, purposeful . cricketer who has vindicated his controversial elevation above Taylor by . out-captaining Cook, delayed his declaration possibly longer than . necessary and set England 481 to win. It was quickly made worse when Nick . Compton, who came into this match with successive centuries, fell . cheaply for the second time in the match. And it could have been made . terminal had Cook not been dropped by diving wicketkeeper BJ Watling on . one. Down and out: Kane Williamson, Brendon McCullum and Hamish Rutherford celebrate taking Cook's wicket . It looked likely to be costly but when . Jonathan Trott was out, uncharacteristically driving at a wide one from . Neil Wagner, and Cook — showing unnecessary attacking intent — was . snaffled by a smart Brownlie catch, England were in big trouble. The departure of the Watford Wall, . nightwatchman Steven Finn, to what became the final ball of the day . completed England’s misery. It is time for some soul-searching before . the return series in England in May and then 10 back-to-back Ashes . Tests. ‘It’s not the sort of conclusion to . the winter we wanted,’ admitted Gooch. ‘We wanted to finish strongly . going into a big summer and build on the Test cricket we played in . India. ‘We’ve had some good performances but . here we’ve not found that form so we’ve got to be disappointed. We can’t . be happy with the way we’ve played.’ Top effort: Ian Bell pouches Brownlie's skier (left) and celebrates with his team-mates (right) HOW KIWI ATTACK WON TEST BATTLE . England came into this series with a much-envied bowling unit. But while Jimmy Anderson and Co have been off the pace, the New Zealand underdogs have shown plenty of bite. All four of England’s main bowlers have underperformed, as the statistics show, while their Kiwi opponents, with the exception of Tim Southee, have all improved their career statistics.","England skipper follows toss error with day-four shocker .

The idea of traveling from Los Angeles to San Francisco in half an hour sounds like the work of an imaginative science fiction writer. But when space engineer and billionaire Elon Musk suggests the idea, people sit up and take notice. His latest project which will be revealed in detail next month, is called the 'Hyperloop'. The aim would be to transport people 380 miles up the Golden State coast from LA to San Francisco. Scroll down for video . Elon Musk will reveal his 'alpha design' for a 'hyperloop' super train next month. Many people have tried to guess how the proposed transport system might work but engineer John Gardi's explanation (pictured) has come the closest so far, according to the tech entrepreneur . It currently takes around 12 hours on . the Coast Line train to make the journey between the two cities, eight . hours in a car and one and half hours to fly. It . would use solar panels for power and use small pods, leaving 'whenever . you arrive' instead of sticking to a schedule like an airliner. Elon Musk has described his supertrain as a cross between 'a Concorde, a rail gun, and an air-hockey table'. Now many are starting to speculate exactly how this next-generation transportation scheme would work. An alternative theory, put forward by physicist Brian Dodson, suggests the hyperloop could be a pneumatic transport system consisting of a closed tube making loops between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The idea was inspired by plans proposed during the early 1900s, pictured . From the few details he has revealed so far, simple maths would suggest the vehicle would have to travel at more than 600 mph. So far, Japan's Maglev train is the only thing that comes close. Its top speed is 361mph although it usually travels closer to 300 mph. Jim . Powell, co-inventor of the bullet train and current director of Maglev . 2000, thinks that’s as fast as open-air rail lines will ever go. 'Air drag becomes too much of a problem after 300 mph, just from a power point of view,' Powell told The Verge. 'And then that air drag starts to generate noise. You wouldn’t want an airplane flying past your house at 600 mph.' The . Hyperloop would solve that by enclosing the craft in a tube, creating a . sealed environment that a car could move through with as little . friction as possible. What . would drive the vehicle forward? The best guess so far is akin to that . used on an air hockey table with accelerated air propelling cars through . the Hyperloop, with room on either end for it to speed up or slow down. The idea would be to reduce friction as much as possible, but generating air at 600 mph is no easy task. The top secret hyperloop train will take passengers along a route from Los Angeles to San Francisco, pictured, in a mere half hour. In a tweet, the Tesla Motors co-founder behind the plans promised to publish the alpha design by 12 August . Another . expert, George Maise has suggested removing all air from the tube . altogether and leaving the cars to travel through a vacuum which would . eliminate any drag. 'If you . have a vacuum in a tube, then you have zero drag,'There's no limit on . the speed, really, but keeping a column of air traveling at nearly . supersonic speeds would require a huge amount of energy to maintain.' Of . course, without worrying about the technology, the track or tube as has . been proposed, the thing needs to be built ant that means clearing a . straight line between the two cities. Unlike a railroad track or an interstate, turns will be difficult. It's the same kind of problem as faced by the 'bullet train'-style Maglev tracks. High speeds pull passengers to the side and even gentle shifts can make passengers sick. A straight line would also mean the project would have to travel through some populated areas. ET3, . a Colorado-based group that's built a number of vacuum-based . transportation prototypes has suggested building vertically on concrete . pillars, just a couple meters across. The result looks more like power lines than a super-highway and it could mean less complaints from the neighbors. The tech entrepreneur claims that his hyperloop super train could be three to four times faster than a ballet train like this one from the East Japan Railway. However he has plenty of problems to overcome from finding a business partner to obtaining land for this ambitious transport project . Elon Musk claims that his hyperloop super train will connect the Californian cities of Los Angeles (Venice Beach is pictured left) and San Francisco (right) with journey times of just 30 minutes . Ultimately, even the experts don't have the answers at this point in time. Mr . Musk is the CEO of SpaceX, the first private company to send supplies . to the International Space Station as well as founding PayPal and . electronic car manufacturer Tesla Motors. Musk said that he will publish an 'alpha design' for his ambitious transportation project on 12 August. He . said that the system will never crash, is immune to weather, is three . or four times faster than a conventional bullet train and travels twice . as fast as the average speed of an aircraft. He . has also reportedly said that the ambitious system could be powered by . solar energy and even generate more energy that it would use. Musk believes the super fast service would have a build cost of around $6bn. While . this might sound like a lot, current plans for a bullet train service . between L.A. and San Francisco with a time of around 3 hours is . predicted to cost in the region of $68bn. 'Other than what Musk has announced, I don't think anyone knows what his ideas are,' says ET3 founder Daryl Oster. The . promise of a half-hour trip across California is genuinely . world-changing, and unlike most entrepreneurs, Musk has a track record . that suggests he could make it happen. However, the technology required for the hyperloop could be so far-fetched that its both magical and yet virtually impossible. 'If . somebody other than Musk had proposed this, I would say it's very . suspect,' George Maise says. 'I really have no idea how you do this.'","Elon Musk will reveal how his 'hyperloop' super train works next month .

A sex abuse victim has revealed how her paedophile stepfather abused her from the age of nine and her mother still does not believe she was indecently assaulted. Jemma Sanders, 28, suffered at the hands of Christopher Gibson for six years and has waived her right to anonymity so she can help fight child abuse. Gibson was convicted of ten charges of indecent assault earlier this month and jailed for eight years but Miss Sanders' estranged mother Debbie has refused to accept his guilt. Brave: Abuse victim Jemma Sanders has waived her anonymity to reveal how she was abused by her stepfather and how her mother stood by him . Miss Sanders said: 'I know now that he touched me inappropriately but at the time I didn't know it was wrong. He was my dad and I just felt loved. 'I remember thinking, ""my daddy thinks that I'm my mummy"". Every time it happened from then on I thought it was normal. 'As I was getting older the abuse was changing and the touching was getting more serious. 'We had sex education in school and that was when I began to realise it was wrong. 'He'd always told me it was 'our little secret' and he wasn't violent so when I was young I'd never known it was wrong.' Jailed: Christopher Gibson will serve up to eight years after abusing Miss Sanders between the age of nine and 16 . Gibson, 49, came into Jemma's life when she was just a year old and her mother and biological father split up. The whole family moved to Withywood, Bristol, where the 28-year-old remembers an uneventful early childhood. She always thought of Gibson as her father and enjoyed the love and attention he showed her and her brothers. But he started abusing her from the age of nine and it continued for six harrowing years. Jemma admits she went off the rails in her teens and became a 'wild child', staying out until all hours, drinking and stealing cigarettes. At one party she got drunk and told a friend what he had been doing to her. In 2003, aged 17, Jemma finally made the decision to tell her mother what had happened to her - but she has always refused to believe her. 'I felt it was time I told my mum what had happened,' she said. 'I said ""mum, I've got something to tell you,"" she said ""are you pregnant?' but I remember saying ""no, it's worse than that, you'd better sit down"". 'I told her what had happened and straight away she went off on one, calling me all the names under the sun, she didn't believe me at all. 'I went to my nan's house and, although she believed me, she persuaded me not to press charges - she said it would destroy the family and be the worse thing I ever did.' In November 2012 she was approached by a police. A detective persuaded her to speak out and Gibson was arrested and charged with 11 counts of indecent assault and two charges of indecency with a child. Getting on with her life: Jemma says she spoke out about her ordeal because she wants to help other abuse victims . Gibson denied the charges but was found guilty on ten counts at Bristol Crown Court earlier this month. 'When he was found guilty I was in complete shock. After ten years of people not believing me I was shocked that someone finally had,' Miss Sanders said. 'My mum refused to hear my victim impact statement when he was sentenced and has never given me a proper chance to tell my side. 'It was the abuse that has destroyed our family, not me, and I want my mum to know that. 'I still suffer with depression and have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. I'm upset at what this has done to my family but I know now that it's not my fault. I was a child and he was supposed to be my dad. 'I wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I went through.' Detective Constable Kerina Balchin said: 'The victim in this case has been extremely brave to waive her legal right to anonymity in order for her voice to be heard. 'I hope this conviction will encourage victims of abuse to come forward in the knowledge that they will be heard and supported by the criminal justice system and that every effort will be made to secure justice for them.' Her mother's decision to stand by her husband and refuse to believe her daughter was reported in open court. She walked out of the courtroom before her daughter's victim impact statement was due to be read by the judge.","Jemma Sanders, 28, suffered at hands of Christopher Gibson for six years .

A 75-year-old former mounted policeman for the Philadelphia Police Department has been charged with sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl. Walter Sasse met the 15-year-old (now 17) at Courtesy Stables where Sasse was employed. The alleged sexual relationship lasted for two years until the girl told her mother and a friend about the indecent acts. Sasse was put behind bars on Wednesday on a list of charges including sexual assault, unlawful sexual contact with a minor, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, corruption of minors and aggravated and indecent assault, reports Philly.com. According to court records an alleged assault happened on June 1, 2011, but police say that investigators believe the sexual relationship was ongoing and started when the girl started working at the stable. Sasse will appear in court for a hearing on March 25. His bail was set at $50,000. He posted 10 per cent and was later released. After Sasse retired from the police force he became a manager at the Courtesy Stable that's dedicated to 'instilling good horsemanship practices in our youth of today,' according to its website. Philly.com spoke to a clinical and forensic psychologist, Veronique Valliere of Allentown, whio said that Sasse's position at the stable may have given him access to the child and could have enabled him to manipulate her. She said that common interests such as horses in this case are,' not only part of the grooming process, but they also create accessibility, a forum for the relationship to form.' Walter worked at the Courtesy Stables in Andora where employees are expected to guide youth not to lead them astray . She continued to talk about how abusers are able to use common interests as a link to form bonds and to test the boundaries of the child. Even though abusers know that what they are doing is wrong they can find a way to ignore those instincts. She said, 'Someone like this, who's able to persuade himself that a 15-year-old is on the same physical and emotional level, he tends to be somewhat narcissistic. He likes to be worshiped, obeyed, looked up to, and gets ego gratification from those needs being met.' Even if a teenager is flirtatious it is the adult's responsibility to take a step back. 'If a 15-year-old asked for the keys to your car, you'd say no. So, if she asked for your penis, why would you say yes?' she added. According to his online biography, Sasse is a retired veteran who rode with the Mounted Patrol Unit's show and drill teams. Now he faces criminal charges that could put him on the opposite side of the law.","Sasse was put behind bars on Wednesday for a list of sexual charges including sexual assault and involuntary deviant sexual intercourse .

Culture Secretary Maria Miller and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling want to water down the penalties for refusing to pay the fee to a civil matter. It is likely to be part of the upcoming negotiations with the BBC over the renewal of its charter. Culture secretary Maria Miller and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling are said to be backing plans to water down punishments for people who don't pay their TV licence . Tory sources said it would be a ‘bargaining chip’ and ‘stick’ for the corporation which has been castigated over its governance and transparency failures. Those who fail to pay their £145.50 licence fee face fines of up to £1,000. Seventy people a year go to prison because they refuse to fork out. Around 180,000 people last year, or roughly one in nine cases before magistrates, is related to licence fee evasion. Some 155,000 are fined. Backbench MPs are also separately supporting decriminalisation in the Deregulation Bill, backing an amendment by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen. Mr Bridgen said that for some cash-strapped families the current law was 'criminalising them for being poor'. But the BBC is likely to fight the idea because the broadcaster has already faced a real terms funding cut with the fee frozen, and has said further cuts could lead to more programmes being lost. Currently 180,000 cases for non payment end up before magistrates each year, with 155,000 people fined and 70 sent to prison . Mr Grayling said: ‘The Culture Secretary and I both agree this is a really interesting idea – particularly given the pressure on our courts system. Our departments will be doing some serious work on the proposal. Speaking to The Telegraph, he added: 'It is outrageous that so many people are brought in to the criminal justice system through this means. 'I believe that non payment should be treated in the way that parking tickets are. 'It is absurd that the courts are being clogged up by such a minor offence.' He has 101 MPs signed up to the move although the Telegraph quoted a DCMS source suggesting Culture Secretary Maria Miller would prefer to wait for the upcoming negotiations over the review of the BBC's charter. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Changing the law could lead to higher evasion. Just a one per cent increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around £35million.’","Maria Miller and Chris Grayling backing plans to water down law .

An astonishing day at Manchester United took an incredible twist on Wednesday night when it emerged the club are close to securing the return of Cristiano Ronaldo. Sportsmail can reveal that outgoing United chief executive David Gill has been in Madrid to meet Jorge Mendes, the Portuguese super-agent who represents the megastar. Sources on Wednesday night insisted the Barclays Premier League champions are confident of securing the return of the player they sold to Real Madrid for a world record £80million in 2009. Scroll down for video . Homecoming? Cristiano Ronaldo is close to a return to Manchester United . News of Ronaldo's return might help David Moyes, who will be the next manager of the club, to persuade the wantaway Wayne Rooney to stay. Outgoing boss Sir Alex Ferguson made no secret of wanting to see former World Player of the Year Ronaldo come back to Old Trafford. When United met Madrid in the Champions League earlier this season, Ferguson said: ‘Was I tempted to bring him back? Yes. He’s still in the hamper.’ On Wednesday, in reaction to Ferguson's decision to retire, Ronaldo tweeted: ‘Thanks for everything, Boss.' He has a great relationship with Ferguson and sees him as a father figure. 'When I arrived, even though I did not want it, he [Ferguson] insisted I have No 7 on my shirt,' Ronaldo had said. Happy days: Ronaldo developed immensely as a player under Ferguson at United and enjoyed great success . Tears and a crown: Ronaldo celebrates winning the Champions League . 'I was adamant that I did not want it. Then, he sat me down and told me about the history of the No 7. He said, ""Do you understand what I am . trying to say to you? I think you will be worthy of wearing this . shirt"". With that, I understood how much confidence he had in me.' Ronaldo scored his 200th goal for Madrid in a 6-2 win at home to nine-man Malaga on Wednesday. The match turned in the 21st minute when Malaga defender Sergio Sanchez was shown a straight red card for bringing Ronaldo down in the area. Although the Portuguese had his spot kick saved by Willy Caballero, who injured himself in the process and had to be replaced by Carlos Kameni, Ronaldo netted with an indirect free kick close to goal in the 26th minute. Take that: Ronaldo lashes in a free-kick to score his 200th Real Madrid goal . Rooney is about to be reunited with Moyes - his first manager in professional football - who will be confirmed on Thursday as the new United boss after meeting Everton chairman Bill Kenwright in London on Wednesday. But Moyes will walk straight into a scrap to keep Rooney after the England striker asked Ferguson for a transfer late last month. Frustrated with life in and out of . the team at Old Trafford, Rooney suggested during a meeting in . Ferguson’s office that he be allowed to leave this summer. Ferguson, it . is understood, told him in no uncertain terms that he would not be sold. Chelsea are leading the race for the striker and value him at £25m. The way they were: Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo shone together for Manchester United . Once a Blue: Chelsea are confident of luring the £25m England striker to Stamford Bridge in the summer... and we've imagined what he'll look like in a blue shirt . It remains to be seen if .

Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are also . interested but PSG, Sportsmail understands, will lose manager Carlo Ancelotti to Madrid as Mourinho’s replacement this summer. Ferguson himself reacted angrily in . February to suggestions Rooney would be sold, stating unequivocally that . the Liverpudlian would be at the club next season. On Wednesday night, a . United spokesman insisted: ‘Wayne Rooney is not for sale.’ Mentor: Rooney with Sir Alex Ferguson on the day he signed for United in 2004 . Day at the races: The England forward was out with his United team-mates on Wednesday . Ferguson’s remarkable 27-year reign as United manager will end in 10 days. On a momentous day for English football, his imminent departure was confirmed at 9.20am on Wednesday. United will announce Moyes’s appointment later on Thursday, after thrashing out the details of a contract worth in the region of £5m a year. Now it can be revealed that not only was 71-year-old Ferguson closely involved in discussions about his replacement, he was actually the key man in picking Moyes. Ferguson has always been a fan of the manager he once considered for a coaching role when his fellow Glaswegian was in charge at Preston in the 1990s. Having told the Glazer family, United’s . owners, back in March that he intended to stand down, Ferguson implored . them to hire the Everton boss. Beer we go: Rooney enjoys a pint at the races on Wednesday . Loyal servant: Rooney has spent nine seasons at Old Trafford . Other key influences, such as Sir Bobby Charlton and Gill, share Ferguson’s view that the 50-year-old will bring United the same ideals of longevity and continuity that are integral to the club, as well as placing an enormous emphasis on the youth system at Old Trafford. On Wednesday night, Moyes was locked in talks with Kenwright about the best way to arrange his departure. Moyes’s contract at Goodison Park expires at the end of the season and he is entitled to walk away. After meeting with Moyes on Wednesday night, Kenwright conceded he had little say in the matter, though he said he knew nothing of an agreement already being in place. He told Sky Sports News: 'I don't know about a deal being done. David had a meeting scheduled with me and we've just had a good meeting. 'At the end of the day David's contract is up in six weeks' time and he has a right to make his own decisions. He's served this club wonderfully well and he has a right to make his own decisions.' Asked if Moyes would still be in charge for Sunday's game against West Ham, Kenwright added: 'Yes, of course he is.' Stars such as Rooney and Ryan Giggs were sitting having breakfast at United’s training ground at 9am when they were summoned to a meeting in the dressing room, where Ferguson told them of his intentions. The much-decorated manager then moved on to two other meetings, where he informed his coaches and administrative staff that Sunday’s match against Swansea would be his last in charge at Old Trafford. The players were told not to tweet about their manager’s departure. Stepping aside: Ferguson spoke to his players first on Wednesday morning . Ferguson said in a statement: ‘The . quality of this league-winning squad, and the balance of ages within it, . bodes well for continued success at the highest level, while the . structure of the youth set-up will ensure that the long-term future of . the club remains a bright one.’ Ferguson . will lift the Premier League trophy on Sunday, take charge for the . final match of the season at West Bromwich Albion and then retire to pursue . other interests and take up a position on the club’s board. In his role as non-executive director . and honorary president, Ferguson’s input to club affairs will be . limited. The board only meets once every two months and on Wednesday he . told his players he would be going ‘nowhere near the dressing room’. Mourinho was another name constantly linked with the United job. It is understood, though, that he was never a realistic candidate, with United’s owners feeling his penchant for controversy would be too much for a club soon to be deprived of the authoritative figure of Gill. Waiting in line: Moyes is expected to take over from Ferguson . Out of the running: Mourinho was never a realistic candidate . 894 games Ferguson has won as United boss. He has drawn 337 and lost 267. 104 players Ferguson has signed as United manager. 263 top-flight managers who have worked during Ferguson’s reign. 14 players in the current squad who weren’t born when Ferguson first took over at United. It emerged on Wednesday night that . Gill’s decision to resign in February was done in the knowledge that . this season could also be Ferguson’s last. Moyes will now be left to form his own relationship with incoming chief executive Ed Woodward. Everton and England defender Leighton Baines is likely to be an early target. It is not yet known what will happen to Ferguson’s current coaching staff. Moyes works closely at Goodison with Steve Round and Chris Woods and may want to integrate his own people into what is already a successful United system. It is possible that former United defender Phil Neville, who is also leaving Everton this summer, will return to Old Trafford with Moyes as a coach, while United veterans Paul Scholes and Giggs are also being considered for coaching roles.","CEO David Gill in talks with Ronaldo's agent about Old Trafford return .

Hallucinating, suicidal and sometimes unable to speak with her family, Schapelle Corby appears to be spinning out of control as her parole term derails under serious threats she be returned to Indonesian prison. The 36-year-old's joy at being freed from Kerobokan prison appears to have turned to despair, with one episode of self harm with a knife and a whole day spent locked in the toilet, her brother-in-law Wayan Widyartha told The Age. Indonesian authorities are expected to decide 'within days' as to whether they will revoke Corby's parole and place her back in jail. 'Hallucinating' and suicidal Schapelle Corby has spun out of control as her parole term derails and Indonesia threatens the 36-year-old drug smuggler with a return to prison . Mr Widyartha, who is Corby's parole guarantor, has begged journalists camped outside his house to ease up as grim-faced Indonesian officials - backed by a strident national media - appear set on cutting short the drug smuggler's hard won freedom. An Indonesian newspaper and TV station are demanding she be immediately returned to custody for affronting the nation with sister Mercedes' claims the 4.2kg of cannabis Corby was caught with had been planted by Indonesian officials. Channel Seven, which broadcast Mercedes' assertion about Schapelle's innocence, is also under investigation, with the Indonesian government saying the network paid the Corby family's bills in the luxury Villa Sentosa Seminyak. One justice official has claimed Mercedes Corby had not told them the truth about Channel Seven paying for the family's stay at a luxury villa. Corby's staunch supporters have also entered the fray, releasing a video on YouTube entitled The Houding of Schapelle Corby. Using Channel 9 footage of Schapelle shot over the fence of the Widyartha compound, the video shows her disquiet when she realises she is being watched and filmed. The clip was released by the Expendable Project, which has vigorously campaigned for Schapelle's innocence, trolling those who question it on social media. Mr Widyartha said  his 'mentally ill' and heavily medicated sister-in-law, who had to leave the premises for meetings with her parole officer, hallucinated about being followed wherever she went. 'It's like an illusion,' he said. 'She's still seeing people [crowding her]. She's still traumatised. 'She's mentally ill. We sometimes can't speak to her. She stayed in the toilet for the whole day, she's still on heavy medication . . . for depression.' Freedom gone sour: Schapelle Corby's moments of joy following her release have turned to fear that Indonesian authorities may revoke her parole and incracerate her again . In a reversal of his wife, Mercedes' denial about reports of Schapelle's episode with a knife, Mr Widyartha admitted Corby had attempted to self harm on Monday night in front of Bali Justice Office corrections chief Sunar Angus, saying it was because of the stress she was under. When Mr Angus and a parole officer went to the house, Schapelle Corby grabbed a knife and threatened to kill herself, reportedly saying about the constant media pack: 'What, are they waiting for me to kill myself?' The family has now consulted a Balinese psychiatrist and an online psychologist. Meanwhile, calls for the revocation of Corby's parole are growing louder, with two local media outlets urging action in the wake of last Sunday's programme about Corby on Channel Seven. On Tuesday, Indonesian Justice Minister Amir Syamsuddin strongly suggested Corby may be sent back to jail. 'There is a probability that her parole will be reconsidered,' he told the Indonesian newspaper, Kompas, adding that if Corby’s parole was revoked it was her family’s fault and that he was under increasing political and domestic pressure following Mercedes' TV interview. Indonesian network Metro TV has published a story which called for the immediate revocation of parole and suggested Indonesia was waiting for its government to take 'tough action'. The online newspaper Media Indonesia claimed Mercedes Corby had 'ridiculed' Indonesian 'law and sovereignty' by suggesting in her interview Schapelle was innocent of smuggling the cannabis in the boogy board bag and had been 'the victim in a set up' by Indonesian officials. Corby was sentenced to 20 years in . prison in 2005 for smuggling 4.1 kilograms of marijuana into Bali, . hidden in a boogie board bag. Jubilation after Corby's release (above) has evaporated as brother-in-law Wayan Widyartha admits a 'heavily medicated' Schapelle locked herself in a toilet for an entire day with her anxiety and depression . Corby's jump for joy (above) following her release has now given way to a suicide attempt, confirmed her her sister Merecdes's husband, Wayan, who is also Schapelle's parole guarantor . Her sentence was reduced after earning remissions for good behaviour, . along with a five-year cut following an appeal for clemency. She was released under strict parole conditions on February 10 and ordered to stay in Indonesia until 2017. Indonesian justice officials warned Corby not to make any claims of innocence while on parole which might cause 'unease' in the nation. Sunar Angus now says he has evidence the Seven network paid for the Corby's three week luxury resort stay, and that Mercedes had told him 'there was no payment'. In . the Seven documentary Corby was shown being whisked away from jail in a van and . later swimming in the surf before enjoying a meal with her family. While she did not give an . interview, Mercedes told how her younger sister had been broken by her time in jail. The clip also showed Schapelle arriving at the Seminyak villa. She . was seen jumping up and down with excitement before a male voice is . heard saying, ‘You can take that thing off,’ referring to the scarf . across her face that perplexed viewers across Australia. By all reports, the excitement and high spirits in the Corby camp in Bali have now disappeared. Little more than three weeks after her release (above) Schapelle may have her hard won freedom cut short, as Indonesian authorities decide 'within days' about whether to return her to jail .","Claims 'mentally ill' Schapelle Corby locked herself in the toilet for a day .

"SKYE MCALPINE PAYS TRIBUTE TO HER BELOVED FATHER . PUBLISHED: . 17:01 EST, 8 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:57 EST, 9 March 2014 . On January 17, my father, Alistair McAlpine, died. He was many extraordinary things: politician, author, builder, gardener, collector of tribal flags from Africa and renowned bon viveur. To me he was my father. To the rest of the world he was Lord McAlpine, the Tory grandee who was smeared by the BBC in the worst possible way. So much about his death pains me – that we will never take me out for lunch again or compliment me on my shoes; that I had three missed calls from him in the days before his death and that I had not got round to calling him back. Family: Lord McAlpine, then Alastair McAlpine, with his wife Romilly holding Skye, then aged four . I thought I was too busy. I was wrong. It pains me that my son Aeneas, now 18 months old, will never really know his grandfather. It pains me to think that the last year of my father’s life was marred by lies and smears. And now it feels as though that scandal is all that people want to remember. Just over a year ago, he was wrongly implicated as a paedophile by the BBC. Although the news report, which claimed that a senior Tory politician had abused boys in care in the 1970s and 1980s, did not name him, it might as well have. Anger: Sky McAlpine (pictured) said seeing her father's name wrongly smeared still sickens her . The BBC, instead, fed his name to tweeters and bloggers, setting him up for trial by social media. Within hours, if you googled ‘Alistair McAlpine’ you got ‘paedo’. Even now I find that excruciating to write. It makes me feel sick to my very core. Aged 70, retired and living a quiet life in the depths of Southern Italy, he found himself at the centre of a media storm the likes of which I could never have imagined. Through no fault or action of his own, he became the subject of hatred and abuse. It was like some kind of hideously surreal nightmare. I was just out of hospital, with a baby boy less than a week old, and he was on the front page of all the papers for all the wrong reasons; reasons so wrong that my friends didn’t pick up the phone to talk to me about it because they didn’t know what to say. Some people still haven’t mentioned it and it looms like an ugly elephant in the room. His name was cleared and the BBC, ITV and a number of high-profile tweeters such as journalist George Monbiot all issued formal apologies. Others, like Sally Bercow, who when she defamed my father’s name had 56,000 Twitter followers, did not and treated it with a distasteful flippancy. The mind boggles at such insensitivity and cruelty. My father spent the last year of his life in litigation, something he should never have had to do and that was far beneath what he deserved. Apologies or no apologies, the damage was already done. A cloud of suspicion hung around him, indelible and poisonous. Two days after he died, I stupidly checked Twitter. People who had never met him said that they were pleased that he had died. And worse. He was a courageous man. Although he must have been terrified – I know I was – he complained not once. Utterly steadfast, he refused to give up on what he knew to be right and went on to make legal history with a libel case against tweeters who had perpetuated the libel. That was so him. He acted with the same honour and dignity with which he led his life. His spirit was unbreakable. As Margaret Thatcher’s treasurer and deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, he was high on the IRA hit list. In 1990, my parents and I were at our home in London, with the television on in the background when he saw a house on the screen that he liked the look of. It took him a moment to realise it was his. Then the phone rang and it was Scotland Yard. The IRA had placed 20lb of Semtex (the Brighton bomb was 6lb) under my bedroom window at West Green, our home in Hampshire. As far as he was concerned, that was the end of one chapter. And so began another. Happy childhood: Skye McAlpine at her parents' London home in 1989, when they were having Sunday lunch . Bliss: A photo from the same day shows the Tory politician at ease and happy. She said his last year was ruined . We moved to Venice. I went to a local Italian school and he embarked on yet another collection. This time it was antique Venetian glass beads, of which he had tens of thousands. Previous collections had included antique garden implements, police truncheons and stuffed birds. His passion for collecting was fuelled by a love of learning, rather than by a desire for possession. He would buy and learn, sell and move on. In the 1960s his interest in contemporary sculpture was enough to keep the industry going. When he moved on to the next thing, he donated his entire collection, including works by Sir Anthony Caro, to the Tate. He loved art for art, not as an investment. He bought works by American painter Mark Rothko, enjoyed them and sold them for a few thousand pounds. When they sold again for millions, he couldn’t have cared less. Always pragmatic and unsentimental, he never indulged in drama, even in the most difficult of circumstances. In 1984 the IRA bombed the Brighton hotel where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and most of her party were staying for the Tory conference. Libel: Sally Bercow's infamous tweet which referenced false allegations that Lord McAlpine was a paedophile . Disrespectful: She later described his lawyers as ambulance chasers and big bullies, denying she libelled him . Within hours of the explosion, he had arranged for the local branch of Marks & Spencer to open so that other delegates who had also survived the attack and lost all their possessions could be dressed and ready in time to open the conference as planned. I remember him telling me that  he hailed a black taxi and asked the cabbie to drive around Brighton picking up anyone who he might see wandering around in their pyjamas and return them to the M&S store, where Daddy stood waiting with a large wodge of cash, paying off the taxis for everyone. There were few problems that he couldn’t solve, few obstacles he couldn’t overcome. He was not a conventional father, any more than he was a conventional man. When I begged for a hamster, he gave me two zebras. He thought that they would make more interesting pets. When I wanted a wendy house, he insisted that I consult an architect for its construction. I think that I was seven at the time. He wrote a play for my puppets and had it bound in a leather book, with illustrations by the Venetian artist Ludovico de Luigi. My doll’s house was Victorian and the desk in my nursery was a Fornasetti collector’s piece. Clash: Sally Bercow outside the High Court, left, and Skye McAlpine at her London home. She writes a food blog . He wasn’t one for school plays and parents’ evenings, but even at the age of four he would take me for lunch with the photographer Terence Donovan or grandees of the party, such as Norman Tebbit. He believed that was the best education he could give me. He had a wicked sense of humour  and relished situations that others might find awkward. Once, I persuaded Mrs Thatcher, when she was Prime Minister, to play hide-and-seek with me at West Green. We went in to the garden and she hid. I was seeking. We didn’t tell anyone what we were doing and when the detectives in charge of her protection couldn’t find her, they raised an alarm.

We spent many Christmases with the Thatchers, sometimes at Chequers, sometimes in London or Venice. My parents gave Sunday lunches that became legendary: he would ply guests with extravagant wines and Albert Roux would cook the food. Anyone from Sidney Nolan, the Australian artist, to Bruce Oldfield, the fashion designer, to half the Cabinet, to someone with a particular interest in poultry (Daddy also collected rare breeds of chickens), would gather round the table. As with everything he did, he cooked on a grand scale: he would scramble an egg with the same sense of occasion and enthusiasm as he would roast a whole goat on the spit and open fire in our kitchen. My life is, in so many ways, the polar opposite of my father’s. I live in a flat in South London above an Eritrean restaurant with my husband Anthony, who works in finance, and our son. I write a blog, From My Dining Table, in which I share my recipes and stories, and try to recreate the charm and wonder of the meals of my childhood. A plump chicken for roasting, fresh fruit for the table or a jug of overblown pink peonies – these are all things that I do today. And they make me think of him. So much of who I am I owe to my father. But above all, I owe to him the belief that if you give all, you win all. Because that is what he did. That is why I miss him.

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 05:06 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:17 EST, 6 March 2014 . A primary school has been accused of imposing a Victorian punishment regime after it secretly forced its pupils to wear a humiliating ‘I am going to the toilet' sign. Staff at Ashbrook Junior School in Borrowash, Derbyshire, made ten and 11-year-olds march to the lavatory with a label round their necks to improve discipline. Only one boy at a time was allowed to use the toilet because of 'mess and damage', including urinating on seats and the floor. Controversial: Ashbrook Primary School in Borrowash, Derbyshire, forced its pupils to wear a humiliating sign if they needed the toilet . The diktat was revealed when Thomas Hayes, 11, was pictured wearing the sign by his shocked sister Sophie, 16, who came to pick him up on Tuesday. Riley Pearson, six, from near Slough, was suspended from his school after he took a bag of Mini Cheddars in his packed lunch before later being expelled for more food related problems. Colnbrook C of E Primary School insisted he was not excluded 'for just having Mini Cheddars in their lunchbox' but because there had been a 'persistent and deliberate breach of school policy, such as bringing in crisps, biscuits, sausage rolls, mini sausages, scotch eggs and similar'. A school is banning parents from watching their children play sport unless they pay £26 to undergo a criminal records check. Last year parents at Isambard Community School in Swindon were told they must fill in a four-page form for the Criminal Records Bureau vetting process, which takes up to eight weeks to be completed. Until that point, parents were not allowed to watch their children represent the school. Friends of a 14-year-old boy who died after a long battle with cancer were sent home from school for refusing to remove wristbands worn in his memory. Jordan Cobby, from Nuneaton, was diagnosed with a tumour behind his eye in 2008 and died aged 14. Tribute wristbands in memory of Jordan were sold at his school, the Nuneaton Academy, following his death, with all proceeds donated to the Teenage Cancer Trust charity. But the school banned pupils from wearing them in 2012, saying they are not part of the uniform, his mother Joanne Meuse said. Father Darren Hayes compared the practice to something you might see in a 'Victorian workhouse'. 'I'm livid that the school did a humiliating thing like this to Thomas and his classmates,' he told The Sun. 'It's disgusting and degrading — the kind of thing you'd expect in a Victorian workhouse, not a school in 2014. 'I've told other parents about it and like me they had no idea this was being done. People . are furious and I've no idea what the head and teachers thought they . were playing at. That sign needs ripping up and chucking in the bin'. Headteacher Mell Julian said the rule had been scrapped but they were still looking at 'alternatives' because of problems when more than one boy was in the toilets. 'We have had some issues recently with the way the Year 6 boys have been behaving in the toilets.  Some doors were damaged and sinks and toilets have been blocked leading to the toilet block flooding,' she said. 'To address this issue we produced a sign for boys to carry to the toilet to help us check that only one pupil was in there at a time.  One of our parents expressed concern with the signs and we immediately stopped using them. 'We are currently reviewing our procedures in light of the concerns raised.  We are sorry if this has caused any distress or upset.' It . came just days after a primary school teacher in Somerset was suspended . for Sellotaping over the mouths of her 10-year-old pupils after they . refused to stop giggling and talking. Parents with children at the school said they were angry at the decision. Lindsey Taylor, 32, whose six-year-old son Brandon is a pupil, said: 'I wouldn't be happy at all if he came home and told me he'd had to wear one of these signs. 'It's like they are being labelled as trouble-makers. It must have been pretty embarrassing for them to have walk around the corridors wearing it.' Embarrassing: Pupils were forced to walk the corridors with the sign on after damage to the toilets . Sarah Slaney, 31, has a seven-year-old son at the school. She said: 'It's unbelievable. This should never have happened. 'There must have been a better way of dealing with this. To make a child wear a degrading sign around their neck isn't right at all.' Mr Hayes, who revealed how son Thomas, 11, was forced to wear the 'degrading' sign, declined to comment further when contacted at his home half a mile from the school earlier today. Priscila Davo Ortega, 27, allegedly lined up more than 20 children during her art lesson and put layers of sticky tape across their lips because they were being too noisy. Parents said that when some children ripped off the tape because they were struggling to breathe, the Spanish-born teacher replaced it. Other children were left with bleeding . lips when the tape was removed, and several said that they were scared . about returning to school. Miss . Ortega has been suspended from teaching art and Spanish at Danesfield . Church of England middle school in Williton, Somerset, pending an . investigation. Police said they would work with the local education . authority. Off work: Teacher Priscilla Davo Ortego has been suspended amid allegations she sellotaped children's mouths closed . Upset: Pupil Thomas Bradbury said some friendss had rashes after the Sellotape placed over their mouths to keep them quiet was torn off . Stacey Bradbury, 28, from Watchet, Somerset, said she was ‘disgusted, shocked, traumatised’ by Miss Ortega’s actions. Her . 10-year-old son Thomas said: ‘She put Sellotape on our mouths just . because we were talking.

Nicolas Anelka was on Monday ordered not to repeat his sick goal salute as it emerged Samir Nasri has also been photographed making the quenelle gesture. Nasri posed for a picture with a friend outside Manchester City’s training ground two months ago. He took to Twitter to apologise and insist the quenelle was meant to be a symbol against ‘the system’ and had no anti-Semitic meaning. Controversial: A picture of Samir Nasri (left) apparently performing the 'quenelle' was on Facebook last month . Facing a ban: Nicolas Anelka is in trouble for this goal celebration against West Ham . Scroll down to the bottom of the page for a detailed look at the controversial gesture . ‘I apologise for causing any hurt to . anyone who might have been misled into thinking this means anything of . that nature,’ said Nasri. West . Bromwich Albion took a tough stance with their French striker after his . gesture following a goal against West Ham provoked an international . outcry. Although Anelka has . agreed not to repeat the gesture he did not apologise. This may be due . to the FA investigation which could land him a ban of more than five . games, according to new regulations governing race-related offences. Albion . caretaker boss Keith Downing admitted the club had been . shocked to discover the quenelle gesture was considered anti-Semitic by . many. Anelka was asked . about it by Downing after the game at Upton Park and told his manager it . had been a dedication for his friend, French comedian Dieudonne. The . striker said he did not mean to cause offence but there was an outcry in . France, where Saturday’s game was screened live. Social media: Nasri's 'quenelle' picture appeared on a Facebook page set up to suport two French soldiers . Social media: The Nasri picture appeared on twitter the day after Anelka's 'quenelle' celebration . Anelka . was ordered on Monday to explain his actions to Albion sporting and . technical director Richard Garlick before a statement was issued. ‘He . again strongly denied intending to cause offence,’ said the statement. ‘The club fully acknowledge Nicolas’s goal celebration has caused . offence in some quarters and has asked Nicolas not to perform the . gesture again. He agreed to adhere to this request.’ Anelka will play on during the FA’s lengthy investigation. Bittersweet: Anelka performed the salute after scoring the first of two goals in a 3-3 draw with West Ham . The . quenelle has already caused problems in the NBA, where French-born . basketball star Tony Parker, of the San Antonio Spurs, was condemned by . Jewish groups after using the salute in a photo with Dieudonne. Parker’s behaviour was ‘disgusting and dangerous’, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Friends: West Brom acting head coach Keith . Downing says that the gesture was a dedication from Anelka (right) to . his French comedian friend Dieudonne (left), which Anelka reiterated on .

The Hull forward tweeted a picture of Anelka’s celebration and wrote: ‘Anelka is a legend i love him is a best french striker’ and included a message of support for Dieudonne. Parker . said: ‘When l was photographed making that gesture three years ago, I . thought it was part of a comedy act and did not know it could be in any . way offensive or harmful. 'Since I have been made aware of the . seriousness of this gesture, I will certainly never repeat it and . sincerely apologise for any misunderstanding.’ Dieudonne has convictions for . spreading race hate, and last week interior minister Manuel Valls . announced that ‘all legal means’ to ban Dieudonne from making public . appearances were being considered, saying: ‘He attacks the  memory of . Holocaust victims in an obvious and unbearable way.’ The . quenelle — touching a shoulder with one hand, keeping the other arm . pointed downwards — is said to be an inverted Nazi salute. Dieudonne and . his supporters claim it is merely an anti-Zionist, anti-establishment . signal and the 47-year-old has threatened to sue those suggesting . otherwise. The gesture . has gone viral on social media and two soldiers were sanctioned by the . French army in September for performing it in uniform in front of a . Paris synagogue. Anelka had also taken to Twitter on Sunday night to insist that his gesture had no . religious or anti-Semitic connection. He wrote: ‘Meaning of quenelle: . anti-system. I do not know what the word religion has to do with this . story!’ Support: QPR defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto tweeted a message to Anelka after his celebration . Fooled: Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho (right) was pictured making the same gesture as Anelka but later claimed he was tricked into doing it . ‘The . quenelle is a dedication to Dini. With regard to the ministers who give . their own interpretations they are the ones who create the confusion . and controversy without knowing what the gesture really means! I shall . therefore ask the people not to be duped by the media. And of course, I . am neither anti-Semitic nor racist.’ Dieudonne . applauded Anelka in a post on his Facebook page. ‘Excellent live . quenelle by Anelka,’ he wrote. ‘Thanks for the support.’ But . Anelka’s actions were roundly criticised elsewhere. Valerie Fourneyron, . the French sports minister, said: ‘Anelka’s gesture is a shocking, . disgusting provocation. There is no place for anti-Semitism and . incitement to hatred on the football pitch.’ Sorry: French basketball star Tony Parker (right) apologised for performing the salute . Controversial: French humorist Dieudonne arriving for a trial at the Paris courthouse on December 13 . Chantal Jouanno, the former . sports minister and a senator in Paris, said: ‘The quenelle is a Nazi . gesture, clearly anti-Semitic and known as such. It is not worth arguing . about interpretation.

Jewish Congress president Dr Moshe Kantor wants Anelka dealt with as if . he ‘had made the infamous outstretched arm salute’ of the Nazis. ‘It . is sickening that such a well-known footballer would make such an . abusive and hateful gesture in front of tens of thousands of spectators.

Former England paceman Darren Gough has reportedly moved out of his family home over a friendship with Towie star Amy Childs, who he met while filming the Winter Olympics-themed reality show The Jump. Childs, 20 years younger than Gough, 43, denied an alleged affair insisting the pair become 'good friends' on the show shot in Austria in January. Gough, who took 229 wickets in his 58 Tests for England, is said to have left the property he shares with wife Anna near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. The cricketer confirmed in a statement through his management that he had separated from his wife. Sweet Childs: Towie star Amy has denied having an affair with former England fast bowler Darren Gough . Close: Darren Gough and Amy Childs became 'good friends' while filming Channel 4 show The Jump in Austria and on Wednesday the cricketer confirmed he has split from his wife Anna . Home: Amy Childs entered her house in Essex with a friend on Wednesday but didn't make a comment . Moved: Gough has reportedly left the family home he shared with wife Anna and their two sons in Milton Keynes . 'In response to the stories in today's (Wednesday's) press I can confirm that I am no . longer in a relationship with Anna. However, we remain close friends and . committed parents to our children. We will not be making any further . comments on this and politely ask that you please respect our family's . privacy at this time,' the statement said. A spokesman for Childs said: 'Amy and Darren met while filming for The Jump, they . became good friends during filming and remain so, they have never been involved . in a relationship'. A friend of Childs told MailOnline they 'became close' and had a 'great time together' but have not seen each other since returning from Austria. 'Amy thought he was charismatic and charming, and they got on really well, but he is not her type. He is 20 years older than her,' the friend said. 'She is really upset to be labelled with this because they are not in a relationship and they haven't seen each other since they got back'. Nobody answered at Gough's family home on Wednesday and no cars were parked on its grand pebble drive. The detached house is walled off from the road with tall wooden gates, and sits on a picturesque country road. On The Jump Gough and Childs were knocked out of the competition in quick succession, with Childs eliminated on January 27 and Gough making a similar exit the following day. Appeal: Gough in action for England at the Rosebowl in 2005 - his Test career ran from 1994 to 2003 . Strong record: The opening bowler took 229 wickets in 58 Tests and 235 wickets in his 159 ODI matches . Close: Gough struggles to keep a straight face while Childs talks on camera during The Jump's filming . Denial: A spokesman for Childs said on Wednesday that her client and the cricketer were not in a relationship . They have maintained regular contact via Twitter following their brief appearance on the Channel 4 show – and a pal of the former TOWIE star admits they 'got close' on the snowy slopes of Innsbruck. Stepping out: Childs admits she and Gough became close on the show . ‘Amy denies they have slept together but admits there are feelings there,' a friend told The Sun's Dan Wooton. ‘She’s not the sort of girl to sleep with a married man. She didn’t cross that line. They were flirting and would hug on nights out. But she thinks it’s unfair that she’s being blamed for any issues in Darren’s relationship.’ Miss Childs is being comforted by her mother at her Essex house today. The star spent some of the morning at her Brentwood salon before returning home. Wearing a yellow tunic and her red shoulder-length hair loose, she ran out of a people carrier and straight into the house with a friend. Shortly afterwards her mother, who lives on the same street, arrived in a black Audi. Her white Range Rover - with the plate ‘Well Jell’ after her TOWIE catchphrase - is parked outside and the home is gated with a coded entrance. A show insider claims Darren and Amy’s friendship blossomed shortly after they arrived in Austria to film the show. ‘The cast went on a huge booze bender on their second night in Innsbruck and Amy and Darren were being really flirty,’ a source told The Sun. ‘The more they drank, the more obvious it was that they fancied each other. They were being very affectionate.’ MailOnline have contacted Mr Gough's agent for further comment. Up in the air: Sir Steve Redgrave (back right next to Gough) was among the celebrities on the show . Charitable: Childs launched the 2012 Sport Relief cause with this saucy shot, and has run the London Marathon . The cricketer’s reported separation from wife Anna - with whom he is a parent to sons Liam and Brennan - comes five years after they reconciled following a divorce in 2002 after eight years of marriage. After they split he said: 'The divorce was good for me. It made me grow up. I have changed a lot since then. When I was younger I thought that playing cricket, taking wickets and making money was all there was to life. I was wrong. There's more than that, but sometimes you don't find that out until it's too late'. Meanwhile, Amy has been single following her split from personal trainer David Peters in May 2013. The Towie star and her 27-year-old partner were together for a year but had reportedly been arguing since Amy's ex Kirk Norcross publicly declared his undying love for the red-headed beautician last April. The final straw came when David discovered that Amy was still in touch with Kirk - with the pair frequently sending each other text messages.","Reports say England cricket great Gough has moved out of family home .

British space scientists are using medieval stained-glass to build a 'state of the art' camera bound for Mars. The space team are using the medieval technology to ensure pictures beamed back from Mars accurately show the colours found on the Red Planet. Scientists have been struggling to see what the surface of Mars looks like because the high ultra violet radiation in the atmosphere causes colours to fade.

Although medieval glass artisans didn't know they were using it, nanotechnology played a key part in creating stained-glass windows. Medieval stained-glass was created by trapping gold nanoparticles in the 'glass matrix' to create a red colour. Silver nanoparticles, meanwhile, gave it a deep yellow colour. Professor Dave Barnes, based at Aberystwyth University, said: 'Mars has little to no ozone in the atmosphere and this means that the high ultra violet radiation can cause colours to fade when exposed to sunlight.

Medieval stained-glass was created by trapping gold nanoparticles in the 'glass matrix' to create a red colour. Silver nanoparticles, meanwhile, gave it a deep yellow colour. This meant that it would never fade, despite sitting in sunlit windows for hundreds of years. Similar stained-glass will be used in a robotic camera during the European Space Agency's ExoMars Rover mission to the Red Planet in 2019. The colour centres in the Rover's camera are formed as a nano-particle suspension within the glass and this acts as an efficient UV blocker. 'The stained-glass idea comes from observing the many stained-glass windows in churches - many of which date back to medieval times. 'These have been exposed to sunlight for centuries and show little to no colour degradation.' The stained-glass will be used in a robotic camera during the European Space Agency's ExoMars Rover mission to the Red Planet in 2019. The 350kg rover's mission will be to scour the surface of Mars for signs of past or present life. It will have a drill to pull samples up from 2m down, and scientific instruments to assess any organic chemistry that might be present. A team of scientists from Aberystwyth University in West Wales have created the 3D Panoramic Camera Instrument (PanCam) and the medieval stained-glass it will use. Professor Barnes said: 'Scientists want the images from Mars to be colour corrected - as if they were being viewed by a human - to help identify scientific targets. The small stained-glass coloured chips measure just 50 mm W 50 mm, are 18 mm high and weigh no more than 25 grams.

The small stained-glass coloured chips measure just 50 mm W 50 mm, are 18 mm high and weigh no more than 25 grams. They were made using traditional medieval processes developed hundreds of years ago. Professor Barnes said: 'We had to go back to some old chemistry ""recipe"" books to find out these traditional methods.

The camera and stained-glass chips are currently being tested in Chile's Atacama desert where Daniel Craig filmed the climax to his second outing as James Bond. The field trials are being held around the the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Hotel at Cerro Paranal - used as the Bond villain's lair in Quantum of Solace - because the barren desert replicates the rocky red surface of Mars. The Aberystwyth team will be responsible for processing the images taken by PanCam during mission using a variety of computer vision techniques and algorithms they have developed.

An obese mother-of-one who tipped the scales at 15st 12lbs and wore a dress size 20 has lost a third of her body weight. Dawn Pace, 51, from Washington near Sunderland, was addicted to crisps and chocolate and struggled with her size for years. She was finally spurred into action to shed the pounds when she realised her health was suffering after consulting doctors. Dawn weighed 15st 12lbs and wore a size 20 (left) and now she now weighs 10st 8lb and wears size 12 (right) Now Dawn, who is 5ft 3in, has shed more than 5st in weight - a third of her body weight - by exercising up to seven hours each week. The biomedical scientist at the University Hospital of North Durham, said: 'A few years ago my weight had spiralled out of control. I had no energy and felt ashamed of the way I looked when I went out. 'I realised I had to do something about it and fast, so I bought an exercise bike for my 50th birthday. However, I had pains in my chest and was very out of breath whenever I used it. 'I tried walking but even this left me breathless and in pain. I felt absolutely lost and couldn't find a way to help myself so I made an appointment to see my GP. 'My doctor, Dr Michael Hubbard, explained I was putting too much stress on my body. He put me on the right path, suggesting I reduce my calorie intake and start a gentle introduction to exercise with swimming. It was a winning formula for me.' Things had got so bad that Dawn, who is married to Derek, 54, a cellular pathology manager, could not find a white coat big enough to fit her at work. Slimline Dawn Pace with her GP Dr Michael Hubbard pictured with her old trousers . Dawn says her daughter, Claire Marie, 26, is delighted at her dramatic transformation . Just five months after embarking on her weight loss programme, Dawn was able to take up more vigorous exercise and now regularly works out at the gym and swims. She will even take part in a swimathon at Newcastle's Elswick Park pool in March, the Race for Life in June and is training for this year's Great North Run. Dawn now weighs in at a healthy 10st 8lb and wears a size 12, and has vowed never to go back to her old ways. 'I can honestly say I had no difficulty in losing the weight,' she explained. 'I think it's just a question of being determined. It's also important to not bore yourself while dieting and give yourself the odd treat. 'I used to have a toastie and chocolate biscuit for breakfast, two full dinners a day and crisps and chocolate for snacks. 'By making better choices, eating more healthily and doing exercise, I have transformed my life. 'Losing weight and changing my body shape has improved my self-esteem and working out definitely gives you the â€˜feel-good' factor. I'm more active and have loads more energy. 'Because I lost weight in a controlled way I'm also confident of being able to maintain my weight in the long term.' Dawn says her daughter, Claire Marie, 26, is delighted at her mother's dramatic transformation. 'My daughter is almost as proud of my weight loss as I am of her and she is very supportive and encouraging of me,' explained Dawn. 'Her passion is clothes shopping and I now have the energy to walk round the shops with her without needing to sit down every few minutes for a rest.' Reducing levels of obesity is a key priority of NHS Sunderland Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), the organisation which plans and buys local NHS health services for the people of Sunderland. Dawn Pace, from Washington, has lost over five stone in weight . The CCG, working with the local authority, is committed to creating better quality of life for local people by reducing lifestyle behaviours such as obesity, smoking and alcohol abuse, which pose a major risk to health. Dawn is now encouraging others at her GP's surgery, Westbourne Medical Group, in Houghton-le-Spring, to lose weight and get fit for the benefit of themselves and their family. She said: 'I hope my story can inspire those needing help. Losing weight has made such a difference to my life. I think it's important to encourage other people because the benefits of losing weight and getting fit are unbelievable. 'Losing weight has opened so many new doors to me and I've built up a great, supportive network of friends at the pool and gym who have all helped me on my journey. The support is out there, just give it a go and don't wait until tomorrow.' Gloria Middleton, who is a partner at the Westbourne Medical Group, and nurse practitioner Lynn Muthu were so impressed by Dawn's weight loss that they decided to start a group weigh-in at their practice. The weigh-in takes place every Friday at noon and everyone is welcome to join in. Lynn also offers advice on healthy eating and helps people in her own time who can't make the weekly weigh-in. 'The session is about supporting our patients,' said Gloria. 'Everyone who is taking part is losing weight - albeit at different rates. Because it's seen as a social thing, we don't want to let each other down. It really is a support group without having to spend money. 'A lot of the staff have also got involved as well because we don't want to let our patients down. 'Dawn was our inspiration,' added Gloria, who herself has lost weight as a result of the scheme.

Haley - who goes by the stage name 'The . Amazing Pandora' - said: 'I have always loved performing, and that's how . I got in to sword swallowing. 'My passion is acting, but I wanted . to expand my variety of perfomances - I can get out of a straight jacket . and hand cuffs, sword swallow, and I would like to try fire eating when . I'm old enough. 'I started . out using a wire hanger and a wooden spoon before I progressed toswords, . and I had done a lot of research into the human anatomy so I know how . everything works.' She went on: 'My dad knew that something was up - I don't usually lock myself away for hours at a time. 'I . was really nervous about telling my parents but they have been really . supportive. They helped me to find out more about it and to choose the . right sword. 'My mum was really worried for me at first, but she knows that I'm careful. My family always come and watch my performances. 'And . my friends all think it is really cool, but they did freak out a bit at . first. I didn't tell any of them about it, so it was a shock for them.' In an amazing demonstration of her sword swallowing prowess Haley lines the blade up (left) before tipping her head back and pushing the 18-inch blade down . After swallowing the full length of the blade (left) Haley poses for the crowd (right) Now comes the tricky part: she pulls the blade back out again (left) then smiles for the camera (right) Haley's dad Jeff and mum Robin . couldn't believe what their daughter had been keeping secret from them . for almost three months. The . dad-of-three said: 'I was quite surprised when she first told us, but I . was pleased that she came to us rather than going off on her own, so I . was happy. 'We have brought the girls up to be really outgoing and none of them are girly so I couldn't really be surprised. 'We . aren't always the most regular family on the block - I threw tomahawks . when I was younger so that could be where she gets it from. 'I joked that she just had a bad case of middle child syndrome and really needed to stand out.'

Haley has been invited to audition for the next series of America's Got Talent and has performed at a number of events across the US in recent months . Dan Meyer, President of the Sword Swallowers Association International, said: 'In . my years of research I've found that most sword swallowers seem to . learn between the ages of 18 and 21, probably because at that age young . people feel daring and invincible. 'But it is rare to find people serious enough about learning the art much younger than that. 'For . Haley to learn the art at the age of 14 is very unusual, and for her to . have her family's support is even rarer still. That she learnt sword . swallowing through months of solitary practice without a mentor is . simply amazing. 'However, . due to the extreme dangers in sword swallowing, we do not condone or . encourage people to learn sword swallowing - especially not youngsters . under the age of 18. 'Haley . has already demonstrated persistence and dedication to studying the . art, and I am convinced that she is highly committed and not turning . back, so I have agreed to help mentor Haley with their parents' permission.

But life was not always so glamorous for the new wife of Hugh Hefner. This dilapidated pub was one of the first homes of American-born model Crystal Harris - who has gone from dregs to riches now that she has married the Playboy tycoon. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Playboy Brummie: Ye Olde Rose and Crown in in West Bromwich, West Midlands, the childhood home of Crystal Harris . Octogenarian Playboy founder Hugh Hefner with his new bride Crystal Harris, who grew up behind the bar in the West Midlands . Humble roots: The 26-year-old model was brought up in this pub in the back streets of West Bromwich . The graduate, who has a degree in psychology, was dubbed a 'runaway bride' by the 86-year-old mogul after she called off their engagement just days before their wedding in June 2011, with 300 guests due to attend. After their split, she revealed she had only been intimate with him once - and very briefly. But the pair reconciled in May last year and married in a lavish Los Angeles ceremony. Hugh recently said he wants to stay with Crystal until he dies and insisted he doesn't care about the 60-year age difference between them. The 26-year-old model was brought up in . the West Midlands pub in West Bromwich - a far cry from the Playboy . Mansion in LA which is her new marital home. The Playmate's parents were British entertainers, who were working at the England-themed amusement park in Lake Havasu City, Arizona when she was born. After Harris' birth they returned to England, where Crystal's mother Lee Lovitt was the landlady of Ye Olde Rose And Crown in the Black Country town. Her family then moved back to the US when Harris was five-years-old to start a property business, where Crystal went to high school and university in California. Crystal's new life could hardly be more removed from her humble roots in the West Midlands. Since Lee and late husband Ray left the pub it has turned to ruin and eventually shut down four years ago. Crystal's parents were popular landlords at Ye Olde Rose and Crown, where Crystal used to sing . Crystal will now be at home in the Playboy Mansion in Beverly Hills - a distinctly different sort of home than her West Midlands one . While the Playboy mansion's ground are filled with pools and tennis courts, the pub's beer garden is home to a mountain of rubbish . The Playboy edition was hastily changed to 'Runaway Bride' after Crystal Harris jilted Hugh Hefner the first time around . Crystal, pictured with her husband, would impress punters with her singing voice . Surrounded by homes and disused industrial land, the tavern has been left to . rot into a state of disrepair. In what was once the beer garden, a mountain of rubbish, including old beer barrels, has piled up and been left to rust and rot. Nigel Pritchett, the most recent landlord before the pub shut, said even as a child Crystal was born to entertain. He said: 'Even though Crystal was just a nipper when they were at the pub, she was known for having a belting voice. 'She would join her dad singing. Everyone thought she was amazing. They were known as a very nice family.' Nigel said punters remembered her father Ray as the 'most popular' landlord the pub had ever had. He added: 'Customers would come and talk about Ray, saying he was a 'live wire', very entertaining. 'He had pictures of himself and famous people he had met like Tom Jones, hanging around. 'I guess attracting stardom just runs in the family. 'All the pubs were busier back then than they are nowadays, but Ray would have it packed out seven days a week anyway.' After she had returned to America, the pretty student was spotted by Playboy bosses after taking up modelling part-time to fund her studies. After meeting 86-year-old Hefner she quit university and the pair started dating. They were previously due to marry in June 2011, but Crystal called off the engagement when she got cold feet. But this week she became one of the richest women in America when she finally married the ageing lothario in a lavish ceremony on New Year's Eve. Crystal is the tycoon's third wife. He married Mildred Williams in 1949 before divorcing 10 years later. In 1989 he married Playmate Kimberly Conrad and they separated in 1998. Vital statistics: . Ye Olde Rose and Crown: .

Detective Chief Inspector Heather Eastwood was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in April 2011 . A senior detective who swore at medics and officers before she was arrested for being drunk and disorderly failed to tell her employers, an investigation by the police watchdog said. Detective Chief Inspector Heather Eastwood was the staff officer for her partner, Cleveland Police Chief Constable Sean Price, when she told a security guard ‘you’re the sort of s*** I normally scrape off my shoe’. Sean Price, who has since married Ms Eastwood, served as Cleveland's Chief Constable from 2003 until October 2012, when he was dismissed for gross misconduct. After the long-running £4.6 million Operation Sacristy into alleged corruption at the force came to an end on Wednesday, with the announcement no-one would face criminal charges, more details about senior officers’ behaviour was released to the public by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Included were details of Ms Eastwood’s arrest for being drunk and disorderly in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, on a Monday afternoon in April 2011. Members of the public were apparently concerned for her welfare and called for an ambulance when she was seen to stagger and fall in the street. She had been drinking wine in a local pub and smelled of alcohol. Two people who helped her before the ambulance arrived were repeatedly told to ‘f**k off’, the IPCC report said. She also abused a paramedic and did not co-operate when a second crew arrived. She was taken to Friarage Hospital in Northallerton, because she had banged her head and while she was there she was abusive towards security staff, trying to hit and kick them. The IPCC report said she asked the security guards: ‘do you know who I am?’. One of them told investigators she said: ‘You’re the sort of s*** I normally scrape off my shoe.’ She was discharged and the police were called as she did not provide a name of someone who could look after her. Disgraced: Her husband Sean Price, former chief constable of Cleveland Police, pictured accepting the Queen's Police medal at Buckingham Palace, was sacked for gross misconduct in 2012 . A North Yorkshire officer and a PCSO visited the hospital and she was arrested when she ‘levelled a volley of abuse at them’, the IPCC said. It appeared she had wet her trousers, the officer said. When she was brought to the custody office, her manner was ‘objectionable’ but unremarkable given she was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. She did not tell custody staff she was a police officer and said she was employed by ‘Redcar and Cleveland Unitary’. She was held in a cell to sober up, during which she said to the detention officer ‘I want to speak to the organ grinder not the monkey’ and ‘get me the duty solicitor now you monkey’, the IPCC report said. She was allowed to ring her partner, referring to him as Sean Smith and the chief constable was called. Ms Eastwood was taken to Friarage Hospital in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, pictured, because she had banged her head. While she was there she was abusive towards security staff, trying to hit and kick them . Around an hour later she was released without charge, and he picked her up. Neither she nor then chief constable Price reported the arrest to Cleveland Police, which employed her, or alerted his employer, Cleveland Police Authority. She told investigators she received a head injury when she intervened in a domestic argument in the pub and said that explained her lack of memory of the day’s events. She told them: ‘Even upon leaving the police station I genuinely did not appreciate that I had been arrested.’ Responding to the investigators, she said her behaviour was totally out of character and she had an unblemished 16-year career. Mr Price told the inquiry team he did not know she had been arrested, and he believed he was rung from the hospital, not the police station, when he was called that evening. Mr Price said his partner told him she had been injured when a man on a bike knocked her down. Ms Eastwood was allowed to resign from Cleveland Police before a disciplinary hearing into her behaviour was held. The IPCC inquiry had recommended she should face a gross misconduct charge. Her husband would also have a case to answer, the report found, for gross misconduct, but he had already been dismissed for a separate matter.","Detective Chief Inspector Heather Eastwood said 'do you know who I am?'

England footballers have given a vote of confidence to team agents 1966 before the World Cup in Brazil by renewing their four-year contract until after the 2018 tournament in Russia. The new deal with 1966, who look after the players’ interests in all the FA’s commercial deals involving the England team, was agreed by the players’ committee of Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart, James Milner and Gareth Barry without the tender process that had happened in 2010.

Team England have been represented by 1966 since 2006, when music mogul Simon Fuller offered to work for free. But he has not been involved in the business since 2008. Barry, seemingly no longer part of Roy Hodgson’s England plans, is likely to step down from the players’ committee after the World Cup. Meanwhile, there hasn’t been time for Vauxhall to film their World Cup advert this week, such have been the needs of England sponsors at the one squad get-together before the World Cup party is named. The promised involvement of A-list players must now be fitted into a week without internationals — complicated for the FA and 1966.

"By . Matt Chorley . and Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 11:50 EST, 12 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:25 EST, 12 November 2013 . British public life is dominated by a privileged private school elite, Education Secretary Michael Gove admitted yesterday. He said former prime minister Sir John Major was right to speak out about the ‘shocking’ domination of a small elite. Sir John’s intervention this week made uncomfortable reading for David Cameron, who attended Eton and whose Cabinet is dominated by former public schoolboys. Downing Street said the Prime Minister believed ‘what counts is not where you come from but where you are going’. Agreement: Michael Gove said it was an 'inescapable fact' that Sir John Major was right about the dominance of a privileged private school elite . Sir John has increased his public profile in recent weeks, demanding a windfall tax on energy companies, urging action to help the 'silent have-nots' and warning about a lack of social mobility. His latest remarks were seen as a thinly-veiled reference to the wealthy . backgrounds of David Cameron's government, in contrast to Sir John's . own upbringing in a rented flat in Brixton, South London. During a speech to the South Norfolk Conservative Association on Friday evening, Sir John said: ‘In every single sphere of . British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held . overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class. ‘To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking.’ Downing . Street rejected the criticism, insisting policies to help people get on . were more important than the background of politicians. But Mr Gove, who was adopted at just four months, insisted Sir John was 'right'. He told BBC Radio 4: 'It’s an inescapable fact. And that’s one of the reasons why both I was speaking today about social work and the vital need to make sure that vulnerable children don’t suffer from neglect and don’t have their futures blighted. 'It’s also why we’re reforming the schools system so that the opportunities that wealthy children have are more equally spread. 'As the Prime Minister said, he’s in business, in politics to spread great education, to make opportunity more equal and that’s what’s happening.' Mr Cameron, who went to Eton, is vulnerable to charges that his Cabinet is dominated by a privileged elite. And some wavering Tories believe he should change tack and bring back grammar schools to help poorer children. But Mr Cameron’s spokesman said yesterday: ‘At the heart of this is the importance of building what the Prime Minister has described as an aspiration nation. He has said what counts is not where you come from but where you are going. ‘That’s why we have put education reform and welfare reform at the heart of Government policy. ‘I actually think that what people around . their breakfast table in the morning, getting their kids ready for . school… what they want to know is the government has the policies to . ensure that their kids can fulfil their talents and ambitions. That’s . what is the most important thing.’ It is the second time in a month that Sir John has spoken out about the dangers of out-of-touch well-heeled politicians indifferent to the needs of the poor. Embarrassing: Both the current Conservative . Prime Minister, David Cameron, left, and his Liberal Democrat Deputy . Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, right, as well as senior members of the . cabinet, were privately schooled . Sir John blamed Labour for the ‘collapse in social mobility’ and the ‘truly shocking’ inequality in the UK. He criticised Ed Miliband's ‘absurd mantra to be the one-nation party’, suggesting that ‘they left a Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration’. The 70-year-old grew up in a rented flat in Brixton and was educated in a comprehensive school where he attained three O-levels. Despite his direct criticism of Labour policies during the speech at South Norfolk Conservative Association’s annual dinner, his comments are also likely to prove embarrassing for David Cameron. The Prime Minister was educated at Eton and went on to study at Oxford University. Several senior members of the Cabinet, including Chancellor George Osborne and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, were privately educated, as was London Mayor Boris Johnson. Sir John suggested that British institutions should return to a system whereby ‘sheer hard graft’ can lead to success, rather than having to rely on privilege. He said: ‘I remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost. 'Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born, not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born. ‘We need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. And it isn’t going to happen magically.’","Education Secretary admits public life is dominated by privileged elite .

Queens Park Rangers are facing a record-breaking fine - even if they are promoted this season - after recording a huge £65.4million loss, taking their overall net debt to £177m. The Championship club have posted their financial report for the year ending May 2013, and the document underlines the heavy spending of co-owner Tony Fernandes' reign. But as a result of their failures on the pitch, QPR are now facing major ramifications under Financial Fair Play regulations, even if they are promoted back in to the Barclays Premier League this season. Not a laughing matter: QPR, co-owned by Tony Fernandes, recorded a loss of £65.4m for the last financial year . Only going to get worse? Harry Redknapp is struggling to win promotion back to the Premier League . Not changing: Even with the huge loss for the year 2012-13, Rangers still forked out for Ravel Morrison . Under Football League Financial Fair Play regulations, the west London club could be forced to pay in-excess of £40million for breaching the rules even if they are promoted this summer. The club have recorded a net debt of £177million - a massive increase from £91.4m the previous year. Turnover dropped from £64m to £60.6m, but wage costs sky-rocketed from £58.5m to £78m. The news casts a huge cloud over the club's future and, in the report, Fernandes wrote: 'Clearly in 2012-13 the club did not meet its performance targets and was relegated from the Premier League. 'A critical driver of any club’s value is its presence in the Premier League, and the club is focused on regaining its Premier League status as quickly as possible. 'The financial results reflect the club’s focus on trying to achieve on-pitch success. Money: The club have only just been able to get Julio Cesar, now at Toroto, off the books . Nonchalant: Jose Bosingwa was derided during his time at Loftus Road in the top flight . 'When, alongside my business partners, I purchased a majority shareholding in the club in August 2011, my goal was to turn QPR into an established Premier League club. 'Being relegated was obviously not part of our plans, but our focus and determination to achieve our long-term goals has not diminished. 'During the summer 2013 transfer window we have worked to put together a squad of players we believe will give us a good chance of achieving promotion back to the Premier League. 'At the time of writing, we have made a good start to the 2013-14 season and we remain confident that under the guidance of our manager, Harry Redknapp, we have a squad capable of challenging for promotion. Struggle: They've not won any of their last four Championship games and drew 1-1 against Leeds last week . 'We are confident that the 2013-14 season will also see the club continue to make progress towards achieving its short, medium and long-term off-pitch targets. 'The group’s key short-term objective is to regain its Premier League status. The board believes that some restructuring of the playing squad is required in order to achieve this. However, they are conscious of the need for expenditure to be closely monitored and controlled. 'The directors, based on cash flow projections prepared by management and through confirmation of continuing support from the groups’ main shareholders and creditors, have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future.'","QPR made a loss of £65.4m in the last financial year .

'I . don't think that sort of thing will bother him. It doesn't seem as if . he has stepped out of line in any way, not at all,' he said. Pardew was left clinging to his job . as Newcastle manager after the club fined him £100,000 and reprimanded . him for the headbutt during an astonishing touchline . bust-up. Clash: Pardew reacted in unprecedented fashion to being barged by the Ireland international . Scuffle: The incident started after Meyler pushed Pardew out of the way with the ball rolling towards him . Newcastle United are disappointed with the actions of its manager Alan Pardew this afternoon (Saturday, 1st March). His behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of Newcastle United. It . is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from . what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result . away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the Barclays . Premier League. Sadly, . the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts . of the players, but instead on the actions of our manager. Alan . unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player, . to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle . United. We have held . discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies . to the Club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions. Alan has . accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behaviour . today and also a Club fine of £100,000. The Club is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment. The Newcastle manager was ordered to . the stands in disgrace by referee Kevin Friend. Then, after his side’s . 4-1 victory, Pardew expressed his regret and said sorry for his actions. Hours later he was fined £100,000 by his club and formally reprimanded for ‘unacceptable behaviour’. But . two of Newcastle’s past heroes, striker Alan Shearer and ex-manager . Graeme Souness, publicly branded Pardew’s position at the club untenable . and insisted United owner Mike Ashley had every right to . tear up the 52-year-old’s contract, which has six years to run. While . his team celebrated victory, Pardew, who has a history of touchline . confrontations with opposition managers, said: ‘I tried to ease him . [Meyler] away and I put my head in a forward motion. You just can’t do . that. I apologised to him, to everyone at Hull and in particular to my . own fans. ‘It was a . heat-of-the-moment thing. I just wanted to get the guy away from me but . it was a forward motion and you can’t do that. I am not stupid enough to . think there’s going to be no punishment. I just have to accept it.’ That . punishment is almost certain to be considerable.

FA chairman Greg Dyke said: ‘It looks serious and we will investigate.’ Shearer, who played more than 300 times for Newcastle, called Pardew’s position at the club untenable. ‘What on earth can Alan Pardew say to his players when they misbehave?’ added Shearer. ‘I have never seen anything like that before, ever. ‘Frankly I wouldn’t be surprised, and I don’t think anybody will be surprised at all, if Alan Pardew were to resign over this. ‘Even if he doesn’t want to resign, the club might be saying to him, “We might be doing you a favour — you resign rather than us sack you”, because that will have to be in his thinking also.’ Souness added: ‘That is a sackable offence. I’ve been frustrated and upset by a number of things, but I’ve never gone down that road.' November 2006: Pardew had earlier in the year criticised Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger for failing to field an English player in the Champions League match against Real Madrid and matters came to a head in West Ham's 1-0 win over Arsenal. Then West Ham boss Pardew's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate Wenger, who claimed he was 'provoked in a disrespectful way', with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official. On this occasion, it was the Gunners boss who was fined by the Football Association, with Pardew cleared of all charges. March 2012: In a Tyne-Wear derby, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over, with Pardew, now Newcastle boss, clashing with Martin O'Neill following his celebration to Shola Ameobi's late equaliser in a heated match. Both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future. August 2012: Pardew came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour 'ridiculous' when he shoved linesman Peter Kirkup in the Magpies' season opener against Tottenham after disagreeing with the official's decision to award Spurs a throw-in. Pardew once again apologised for his actions but the Football Association took a dim view and hit him with a two-match touchline ban and a £20,000 fine. January 2014: Pardew became involved in another touchline row, less than a month after having heated words with Southampton boss Pochettino, with Manchester City manager Pellegrini. Television cameras clearly showed the Newcastle boss launching an expletive-laden volley at the Chilean. Pardew was spared punishment but said later: 'It was a heat of the moment thing, words we always have as managers, to a degree. I've apologised and I'm fortunate that he's accepted that.'","Alan Pardew fined £100,000 by Newcastle after headbutting Hull City's David Meyler .

The Los Angeles City Council voted on Tuesday to ban the use of electronic cigarettes, also known as 'vaping' ' from restaurants, bars, nightclubs and other public spaces in the nation's second-largest city. A spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti said that he would sign the measure into law in the coming days. When he does, Los Angeles will join a growing list of cities, including New York, Boston and Chicago, that restrict the use of e-cigarettes, which are battery-powered cartridges filled with liquid nicotine that creates an inhalable vapor when heated. Scroll down for video . Industry insiders believe e-cigarettes will eventually overtake big tobacco's $80 billion per year industry . At stake is the future of an industry that some analysts believe will eventually overtake the $80 billion-a-year tobacco business. Public health experts fear that vaping, which has recently gained popularity among teens and young adults, may serve as a gateway to smoking for the uninitiated. Critics also point to potential harm posed from second-hand vapor from e-cigarettes, saying too little is known about the effects of the chemicals contained in the cartridges. 'We have an obligation to protect the workforce from the effects of secondhand aerosol exhaled by people who choose to 'vape' on e-cigarettes,' said City Council member Mitch O'Farrell, who co-sponsored the proposal. 'We also have a responsibility to protect our youth and everyone else in public places from the carcinogens found in the ultra-fine particles in e-cigarette aerosol,' he said. The proposal was opposed by the makers of e-cigarettes, who pitch their product as a safer alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes and say there is no evidence that second-hand vape smoke is harmful. Advocates of e-cigarettes also say they can help smokers kick the habit. The Los Angeles ban differs from restrictions in other major cities in that it was amended to allow vaping in lounges and e-cigarette stores and for filming or theatrical purposes. E-cigarettes contain no tobacco, but that has not stopped lawmakers from banning them even in workplaces . 'Although we believe the final decision was made in the absence of credible science, it was a more reasonable and sensible approach than the original proposal,' NJOY, the largest independent maker of e-cigarettes, said in a written statement. 'NJOY remains concerned, however, that banning e-cigarette use in public places could deter current tobacco smokers from using the products and thus disserves public health,' the company said. The City Council action comes as the U.S. government is contemplating further regulations at the national level. The Food and Drug Administration has already proposed a rule that would bring e-cigarettes under its jurisdiction and could potentially require companies to register and pay fees, list the ingredients in their products, obtain approval for new products and restrict online sales and marketing to children. A law passed in 2009 gave the FDA the authority to regulate cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco. It also gave the agency the power to deem other tobacco products to be within its jurisdiction, but it must first issue a rule to that effect. E-cigarette companies believe they should be exempt from the full spectrum of regulations, saying that would stifle innovation, damage small business and hurt consumers trying to quit smoking. Tobacco company Lorillard Inc, the owner of the blu e-cigarette brand, is the dominant player in the field, followed by privately held NJOY and LOGIC Technology. The three account for an estimated 80 percent of the market.","Health risks of 'vaping' compared to regular smoking are still unclear but could still be harmful .

A small law firm in Ealing and the owner of a Wimbledon Chinese restaurant have been caught up in Birmingham owner Carson Yeung’s £55million money-laundering activities. The transcripts from convicted Yeung’s Hong Kong court case reveal he amazingly deposited $36.4m with Prince Evans solicitors, who operate from an office on Uxbridge Road, Ealing, West London, and are best known locally for social housing, residential and commercial  conveyance business. The millions transferred to Prince Evans was the subject of conflicting claims during Yeung’s  trial. Yeung’s financial advisor said it was to acquire Birmingham City while Carson claimed it was for a London property. Later it was stated in court the cash deposit had been made on behalf of alleged triad gang leader, Cheung Chi Tai. Deposit: Birmingham owner Carson Yeung was found guilty of money laundering in Hong Kong on Monday . It is understood that Yeung was introduced to the Ealing solicitors by his friend Marco Yu, an unlicensed football agent who had used their services while conducting small-scale transfer business. Yu twice failed to pass football agents exams set in Hong Kong, and runs the Bayee Village restaurant in Wimbledon frequented by football figures including Roberto Di Matteo.

I was at Craven Cottage on Saturday for Felix Magath’s first home game in charge of Fulham, but he took a beating and learned a lesson from Jose Mourinho. It’s Oscars weekend – and no I’m not talking about the Brazilian Chelsea man. So these are the footballing Oscars from Chelsea’s 3-1 win at Fulham. The Jekyll and Hyde Award…. Andrea Schurrle. A performance so bad it made me want to cry in the first half, he was awful. He couldn’t kick the ball properly. Just before half time Ramires was in acres of space 40 yards out with time to pick a pass. Schurrle was waving like a crazed windmill on the left unmarked, Ramires looked at him, and couldn’t bring himself to pass to the useless German. Game of two halves: Chelsea's Andre Schurrle was ineffective in the first-half but then scored a hat-trick as the Blues ran out 3-1 winners in the west London derby at Fulham . Off the pace: Schurrle couldn't get into the game before half-time and here is muscled off the ball by Fulham's Dan Burn . Changed man: But after the interval, Schurrle was unplayable, scoring three times as Chelsea went four points clear at the top . After listening to Mourinho’s expletives at half time, Schurrle turned into a very good professional footballer. His movement was excellent, his finishing even better. He bagged a hat-trick, his second of the season after scoring three for Germany in a qualifier in Sweden. His goals at Craven Cottage were his first in a Chelsea shirt in nearly three months. The Real Player of the Season Award…. Should go to Eden Hazard. If you want to just count up goal totals then give it to Luis Suarez. But if you love football then Hazard is the only winner. Wizardry: Eden Hazard was Chelsea's stand-out performer and should be named player of the season . For the purists: Hazard should win the accolade for the manner in which he controls games from midfield . CLICK HERE TO READ ROB DRAPER'S REPORT FROM CRAVEN COTTAGE . Hazard was quiet first half but then ran the game after the break. His vision and execution were perfect. Fulham were totally bamboozled by this genius. Eden Hazard? More like Eden Wizard. Massive Understatement Award… . Fulham Chairman Shahid Khan said before the game that appointing a third manager this season might be considered “unconventional or unpopular.” No, really? He justified it by saying he had to do it to prevent a “non-stop slide in the table.” Well he’s certainly done that. Fulham are bottom and can’t slide any further down the table. Fooling nobody: Fulham owner Shahid Khan is onto his third manager of the season but the club's fortunes have still not improved . The Ineffective Mind Games Award… . Felix Magath. He said before the game that Chelsea have “the mentality of champions.” Was that designed to undermine the opponents? Make them feel over-confident or even complacent? Well it didn’t work. Chelsea didn’t even bother turning up for the first-half yet still made Fulham look like a Championship side, which is probably what they’ll be next season. Message to Magath – don’t mess around trying to play mind games with Mourinho. Pointless. Psychological warfare: Fulham manager Felix Magath tried the mind games to try and unsettle Chelsea before the match... but his ploy failed miserably . Mulling it over: Magath troops off looking dejected after the 3-1 defeat, which left Fulham firmly rooted to the bottom of the table . The Ineffective Mind Games Bonus Award… . To Jose Mourinho who refused to acknowledge after the game that Chelsea are top of the table. They’re not only top, they’re four points clear. He’s normally so adept at the football psycho stuff, but nobody is fooled by this one, poor effort Jose. All in the mind: Nobody is fooled by Mourinho's claims that Chelsea are not genuine Premier League title contenders . Sitting pretty: Chelsea opened up a four-point lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League following the win . The Stupid Hard man Award… . Brede Hangeland. Determined to head a ball away he went in full force, no nonsense, and smashed his temple into the top of team-mate Kieron Richardson’s head. Ouch. Remarkably the Norwegian tried to carry on. But couldn’t. Obviously. It was daft to even think he could carry on. A bonus “bottler” award for Fernando Torres during this incident. The Spaniard saw the Richardson/Hangeland sandwich coming and bottled out of it in good time - wise move. Groggy: Brede Hangeland collided with teammate Kieron Richardson and had to go off with concussion . The World Cup Hopes Fading Fast Award… . Goes jointly to Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole. Bizarrely Jose Mourinho claimed this week that both “deserve” a place in Roy Hodgson’s squad for Brazil. Er…why? Just because they’ve both played over 100 times for England? I don’t think so. Much respect to both of course, but it’s not a jolly. Roy has to balance building for the future with putting on a respectable show this summer. I’m sorry but for Frank and Ashley that means no trip for them in my opinion. Mourinho put both of them on the bench at Fulham, and they stayed there for the full 90 minutes. Benched: Ashley Cole was an unused substitute at Craven Cottage as his chances of going to the World Cup fade further . Waning influence: Frank Lampard was also kept on the bench at Fulham . The Premier League Title Award… . Goes to Chelsea. Or at least, it could do. I tipped Chelsea pre-season and I see no reason to change that. I’ve seen them play terribly this season – I was at the Britannia Stadium to watch them beaten 3-2  by Stoke. But it seems that when they’ve learned a lot from that kind of result. They were so bad in the first-half at Fulham but still ended up winning comfortably. Mourinho keeps insisting they can’t win the title, but he won’t mind being wrong on this one – if Chelsea are crowned champions he can heap praise on his players, and they will love him even more. Meantime Mourinho’s ego will privately soak up all the praise that will inevitably head his way. Bound for glory: Chelsea are clear favourites to win a fourth Premier League title now . Jose has one massive advantage over Pellegrini and Rodgers (forget Wenger. Seriously, forget Wenger. Do I need to explain why?) – he knows how to win the title in England, he knows how to finish the job. I can’t see it happening but if another manager finishes above Mourinho come the end of this season then they’ve done a brilliant job.","Magath was taught a lesson by Mourinho in first home game .

As the pair waited for a ball to arrive in the penalty area, De Rossi swung a right arm from behind Icardi, planting one flush on the Argentina forward's jaw. The vicious incident wasn't picked up by referee Mauro Bergonzi, but was captured by television cameras and the 30-year-old midfielder has since been dropped by Italy for a breach of manager Cesare Prandelli's ethical code.

From model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's . beloved wheatgrass-packed green juice to Miranda Kerr's favourite Kale chips there are plenty of stars who are walking adverts for the power of vitamins and beauty boosting fruits. But their kitchen staples are set to be replaced by a new arsenal of super fruits you've probably never heard of...yet. Mangosteen, kohlrabi and black rice are tipped to be this season's most potent aids in boosting our health - but what are they and how can you incorporate them into your diet? Famous fans: Miranda Kerr (left) and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley put green juices on the map, but will they champion the latest super fruits? Mangosteen is a tropical fruit native . to Southeast Asia and is touted for being packed with antioxidants, . particularly the rare xanthones - hailed for their anti-ageing . properties. It has also been claimed that it helps the immune system, improves joint flexibility, and provides mental support. In some countries where it grows, it is used to cure diarrhea, infections, tuberculosis, and a host of other illnesses. Most commonly available in juice form from Thai supermarkets, its . fruit, rind and pulp are pureed together and can be mixed with other . types of juice. New kids on the block: Mangosteen is one of the super fruits touted to take the health world by storm. It helps the immune system, improves joint flexibility, and provides mental support . The low calorie fruit, which is high in fibre, can also be dried and turned into a powder. Speaking about the hot new super fruit on the block, Shona Wilkinson, Head Nutritionist at www.nutricentre.com, said: 'Mangosteen tastes delicious. It . is low in calories and rich in fibre - a great snack for weight . management. 'It is also a good source of the antioxidant Vitamin C and great for energy levels. It . contains B vitamins such as thiamine, niacin and folates. These act . as co-factors and help the body to metabolise carbohydrates, proteins . and fats. Overall, a great nutrient dense fruit.' Celebrity nutritionist, Madeleine Shaw, who works with Millie Mackintosh, described it as an 'awesome fruit'. 'Don't . be scared by its strange appearance. It contains lots of vitamin C to . ward off colds and acts as an anti-inflammatory. It's amazing with a dollop of fresh organic yogurt,' she said. If you never quite jumped onto the kale bandwagon or are tiring of its acquired taste then Kohlrabi could be the perfect option. Potent: It has been claimed that Mangosteen helps the immune system, improves joint flexibility, and provides mental support. While black rice (right) is loaded with iron and vitamin E and has more anthocyanin antioxidants than blueberries . Nutrient dense: Kohlrabi is a turnip-like plant packed with . fibre to help with the digestive system. It has high nutrient to calorie . ration so great for people watching their weight . Kohlrabi comes from the cabbage family and is already a firm favourite of Germans and South Indians thanks to its high antioxidant properties. Food blogger Amy Pantlin said: 'It can be eaten raw cut into wedges for snacks with creamy dips, or can be shredded to add a crunch to salads and slaws. It's so versatile.' It can be used to thicken soups or stews, or boiled and added to mashed potatoes or roasted as an alternative to carbs. Speaking about its benefits, Shona Wilkinson said: 'It is a great source of vitamin C which can help the immune system. 'It is also a good source of fibre to help with the digestive system. It has high nutrient to calorie ration so great for people watching their weight.' Sip the goodness: Thought to be approximately ten times more potent than regular brewed green tea, matcha can raise energy levels, boost metabolism and help regulate blood sugar levels . Guy Watson, founder of Riverford.co.uk, said: 'Kohlrabi tends to be thought of as a root vegetable, but in botanical or morphological terms they are the swollen stem base of a cabbage. 'Flavourwise, kohlrabi is somewhere between a large radish, a French-style summer turnip and a broccoli stem, with an appley crunch and mild taste. 'More of a light and refreshing vegetable than leafy, iron-rich kale, their flavour and texture works well in a salad, either finely sliced or grated, and perhaps with carrots - think mild turnip when planning the flavour. 'They can also be stir-fried, steamed or boiled and while the leaves are sparse they are very tender and can be eaten like greens, so try not to waste them. 'Kohlrabi certainly causes many inquiring calls to our customer services teams on the farms when they first appear in our vegboxes, but they generally go down well once customers know what to do with them.' If you're looking for an alternative to coffee and are bored of green, white and even black tea, matcha tea is set to be hot businesses. Thought to be approximately ten times more potent than regular brewed green tea, matcha can raise energy levels, boost metabolism and help regulate blood sugar levels without the 'high and low' effect that caffeine can often have. Shona Wilkinson explained: 'Matcha tea has a very high ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) value. With its potent antioxidant properties it is a great product to help protect the body against free-radical damage. 'It also contains good levels of L-Theanine, an amino acid which is able to exert a relaxing effect on the body. The tea has high levels of chlorophyll too.' Madeleine added: 'Matcha tea is loaded with antioxidants to keep your skin young and glowing. I love to have a cup of tea with some coconut oil in to help with afternoon sugar cravings.' Bored of quinoa? Make way for black rice - a gluten-free, fibre rich grain linked to great heart health. 'Black rice is extremely high in antioxidants, explained Shona. 'In particular anthocyanins which are thought to help prevent the build up of plaque in the arteries - therefore great for helping the cardiovascular system.' Madeleine added: 'It's loaded with iron and vitamin E. This grain has more anthocyanin antioxidants than blueberries.'","Mangosteen is a fruit that boosts immunity and improves joint flexibility .

"By . Adrian Durham . PUBLISHED: . 05:03 EST, 18 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:18 EST, 18 February 2014 . Jose Mourinho has a point when he . says Arsene Wenger is a specialist in failure. It is all Wenger has . known since 2005 – no other top club in Europe would accept this state . of affairs. Whether you love Wenger or not, whether you buy the excuse . about the stadium or not, Arsenal have been without a trophy for too . long. It really is that simple. The . pomposity of the Wenger supporters out there among the press and in . football has been cringeworthy. They’ve wasted no time accusing Mourinho . of lacking class. Was what Jose said any more insulting than Wenger . telling his own fans that fourth place is a trophy? But . did Mourinho need to say what he said? He could have made his point in a . more subtle fashion, that’s for sure. That would probably have had more . impact. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger laugh off Jose Mourinho's comments . Struggles: Jose Mourinho made a point of pointing out Arsene Wenger's failings this week . The big ones: Arsenal must win either the Premier League or Champions League to appease supporters . Mistake, Jose? The Chelsea boss may look back and regret comments made about Wenger this week . But he bulldozed in, and I can’t help thinking Jose’s made three mistakes here: . 1) He will look a fool if Arsenal win the Premier League or the Champions . League this season. (Please don’t include the FA Cup as meaningful . success for Arsenal. It’ll be a good day out for the fans, but that’s . all. They’ve waited too long to settle for the trophy Wigan won last . year.) 2) Mourinho’s response to being humiliated by Guardiola in Spain (when . Real Madrid lost 5-0 at the Nou Camp) was to get very personal with his . rival. In the short-term it worked, Guardiola was exhausted by it all . and quit, Mourinho won a title, but ultimately left the job in disgrace . and widely considered more a failure than a success. Getting personal . didn’t work back then, and it may not work now. 3) Mourinho . has once again made himself the only mouthpiece for Chelsea Football . Club - the figurehead and the chief representative of the club. This . power trip contributed massively to his downfall first time at Stamford . Bridge. And his departure at Inter Milan. And his fallout with the . hierarchy at Real Madrid. Mourinho had won a lot of admiration after Chelsea’s brilliant win at Manchester City in the Premier League. I . don’t know why he decided to pick on Wenger. Mourinho’s trophy success . stands up comfortably against Wenger’s, so maybe the Chelsea boss should . pick on someone his own size. They’re both in England for massive European games this week, but for me Bayern Munich are still in Barcelona’s shadow. Sure you can throw last season’s semi-final at me, where with Lionel Messi unfit but playing in the first leg - unable to play in the second leg - the Germans totally swept Barca aside. They’ve gone 46 games unbeaten in the Bundesliga – they’re a fantastic side. Think again! Bayern Munich are still in Barcelona's shadow - despite winning the Champions League last year . But I’m talking about Barcelona at their peak, who won three Champions League finals in six years. The third success, at Wembley against Manchester United in 2011, had even Sir Alex Ferguson admitting he couldn’t compete with such a brilliant side. Fergie had a tactical plan to exact revenge on Guardiola after the defeat in the final in 2009 in Rome - one he had his players practising for 10 days up to the final. But not even the great Sir Alex could match Guardiola. Wayne Rooney, Antonio Valencia and Michael Carrick were all singled out for criticism by Fergie, but in truth United were second best in all departments. During their dominant era, Barcelona absolutely overwhelmed Real Madrid with a stunning display of beautiful passing and devastating finishing, not once but twice: there was the 6-2 win at the Bernabeu with Xavi’s right foot on fire, and with Messi and Thierry Henry totally dominating Juande Ramos’ side on their own patch; and then there was the 5-0 mauling at the Nou Camp, Mourinho’s first El Clasico, a beautiful team display of perfect football. Habit: Barca have won Europe's premier competition three times in the last eight seasons - including 2011 . Difficult: Sir Alex Ferguson admitted the Catalans were just too good for Manchester United at Wembley . Down and out: Barca were so good in their 5-0 win against Real in 2010 that Iker Casillas dumfounded . Easy! Mundo Deportivo carried this front page after a super Lionel Messi display . On virtually a weekly basis, Barcelona played some mesmerising football in La Liga and the Champions League. It was a joy to watch. They still hit those peaks now of course, but not as regularly. As Gerard Pique said this week, the fear factor around Barcelona has waned a little. Barcelona’s era of dominance in Europe lasted for at least six years. Bayern Munich have been top dogs for only a year and a half so far. They have finally put Dortmund in their place, but needed to spend an absolute fortune to do it. Champions League defeats in the past 12 months at home against Arsenal and Manchester City, both yet to be true winners in Europe, cost them very little in the bigger picture, but hint at a fragility undermining claims Munich are better than Barcelona. Let’s pay due respect to what could turn out to be the best club side we’ll ever see in our lifetime. Barcelona deserve more respect than to be considered second best to this Bayern Munich outfit. Have the Bavarians reached the levels over a sustained period of time that Barcelona achieved? Not in my opinion, not yet. Pep’s Barca were the very best. Pep’s Bayern have a long way to go before comparisons can properly begin to be made. Growing: Pep Guardiola's Bayern have a long way to go in their quest of replicating Barca's dominance . Fulham are being laughed at across the country. Martin Jol, Rene Meulensteen, Ray Wilkins, Alan Curbishley and Felix Magath are all managers, and have all at some point this season been hired by the club. If things aren’t going well, just keep appointing managers seems to be the logic. In the meantime players are coming and going – indeed two players – Adel Taarabt and Dimitar Berbatov - were deemed surplus to requirements in January, yet while Fulham hurtled headfirst towards the bottom of the table, these players were picked up by Monaco and AC Milan. Both have already scored for their new clubs. Potted: Fulham dispensed of Rene Meulensteen as manager after less than three months in charge . Incoming! Felix Magath has been brought in to try and arrest the slide to the Championship . It’s a club on the face of it blundering its way towards the Championship. But there is another way of looking at events at Craven Cottage. It takes a brave chairman to admit he got something wrong with such regularity. And if he’s prepared to face up to his own mistakes, and make a wise choice in rectifying the problem, he should be rewarded at the end of the season. Sticking with the wrong manager can’t be a good idea. But change is only good if the right man is brought in. Let’s see if Magath is better than the four other managers given various roles at Fulham this season. One that got away: Dimitar Berbatov (left) has already made an impression by scoring at Monaco . Tactical masterclass: Darren Ferguson switched formations three times during the win at Swindon . On Monday night I took my son to Swindon to watch our club, Peterborough United, try to get to Wembley for the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy Final. We witnessed a tactical masterclass from Darren Ferguson – he changed formation three times in the second half, ending up virtually 3-6-1 to seal a draw on the night - and a show of nerve during the penalty shootout, ending in Posh booking their trip to Wembley. It’s the stuff memories are made of – me and my boy will be talking about it for years. It’s the kind of night that makes a boy proud to support his club, while the other kids at his school in the Home Counties support Spurs, Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea. Posh fans will have a great day out at the very least this season – and that means even though we support a small club, in a lower division, we will enjoy our season far more than the vast majority of supporters across the country. The fans of Newcastle, Aston Villa, Norwich, West Brom, West Ham and others won’t have a day out at Wembley, or a comparable high this year. Big night! Adrian Durham and his son celebrate as Peterborough progress at the County Ground . Off to Wembley! Posh reached the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final after the penalty shootout win . Bleak: Peterborough are likely to enjoy more success than Manchester United this season . You see it doesn’t matter what division you’re in, or what competition you get to the final of. What matters is that the team you love give you great times. And there is no doubt my team did that on Monday night. Even Manchester United fans are unlikely to enjoy anything remotely close to the kind of excitement my son and I will have as we build up to the big day, and then head to Wembley itself for the game. The Ferguson family still have something to shout about, despite Manchester United’s season from hell.","Jose Mourinho was spot on to lay into rival Arsene Wenger .

The young blonde stars in the outrageous show which follows the lives of . the party-loving inhabitants of south Wales. But Twitter trolls told Carley she looked like a 'whale', so she was keen to get in shape for the third series, which premiered on . Tuesday at 10pm on MTV. She said: 'I've finally hit my target weight and slimmed down my tummy to fit a size 10 dress. 'I've been working hard to change my lifestyle and slim down. I was close to my ideal body shape and the treatment just gave me a nudge in the right direction. It's always hardest to get rid of your tummy fat but I'm amazed by the results, so good!' She added: 'I feel disgusting when I am overweight. You always get a lot of abuse on Twitter. It affected my self-esteem so much. I am determined to put everything right so I can feel confident about my appearance. And now I don't care what people say. I feel fantastic.' Carley says following her overhaul she no longer has a muffin top over jeans, nor a pot belly in dresses . Carley went on crash diets after receiving hurtful comments about her figure on Twitter, but none of them worked and afterwards she always regained any weight she might have lost. It was only after getting healthy diet and fitness advice at No 1 Boot Camp - where she spent a week with with ex-military fitness trainers - that she was able to get down to 9st 9lbs and not put the weight back on. But she still had a stubborn bit of flabby tummy she was desperate to shift and which would always show when she tried to squeeze herself into size 10 clothes. But this, she says, has been helped by her fat-freezing treatment, and so she no longer has a muffin- top over tight jeans, nor a visible pot belly in bodycon dresses. Carley said: 'It's so hard to lose the weight and so easy to put it on. When we are filming I drink most nights and eat rubbish at all the wrong times. But this time I wanted to look and feel great on camera. The weight loss has been amazing. I'm feeling good and I'm determined to keep the weight off.' She added: 'I'd really recommend it to anyone wanting to get rid of those last few inches. It's quick and easy. I'm thinking of having it done again, on my hips this time.

Indian 'baby farms' are thriving as demand from couples from developed countries, including the UK, soars. Infertile couples are turning to women in India to carry and give birth to their children, as commercial surrogacy is not legal in certain countries, or if it is legal, can be prohibitively expensive. The money these women are earn - as much as £4,700 per pregnancy - is transforming communities. Indian 'baby farms' are helping  poverty-stricken women and their families in India move from the slums to comfortable homes and set up businesses . The Akanksha Infertility Clinic in . Anand, a small town in the Indian state of Gujarat, is at the . forefront of the commercial surrogacy in India. The treatment at the clinic costs from £17,000 with the surrogate receiving about £4,700 as a fee. The surrogates generally come from poor backgrounds. In India, about one third of the population lives on less than 75p a day. The clinic started offering surrogacy services about ten years ago, and since then more than 700 babies have been delivered there. The money paid to women for carrying other people's babies has had a huge economic impact on families in the surrounding villages . Sarla Patelia, 40, lives in a village called Manjipura about 25km from Anand. She was a surrogate in 2009 and 2012. With the money she earned, she built a new two-storey house and moved her family out of the hut with a tin-roof they were living in previously. She has two sons, aged nine and 10. 'It completely changed our lives,' she says, explaining that her husband, Shashikant, 44, had a tumour and she was able to pay for a life-saving operation which cost 150,000 rupees (£1,470), which they otherwise would not have been able to afford. Infertile couples sometimes opt for a surrogate mother in India to carry and give birth to their child - with the surrogate receiving around £4,700 . In India, about one third of the population lives on less than 75p a day so women are reportedly joining a 'long queue' to act as a surrogate . The Akanksha Infertility Clinic in Anand has been at the forefront of the commercial surrogacy in India . Surrogates always come from very poor backgrounds and often use the money to build houses . 'We don't actually have a source of income at the moment,' she says. 'We're still living off the money from the surrogacy.' Neeta Makwara, 30, who lives not far away in the village of Nadiad, gave birth to a baby boy for a foreign couple in 2008 and to twins for another couple in 2011. The first time, her husband, a rickshaw driver, squandered all the money she received. But the second time, she used the money to build a three-storey house and now makes a bit of cash each month from renting out the ground floor. Commercial surrogacy became legal in India in 2002 but it is illegal in countries including the UK and Australia. A surrogate cannot legally be paid to carry a child in the UK; only their expenses can be covered. The clinic started offering surrogacy services about ten years ago and more than 700 babies being delivered there to date . The majority of demand comes from foreign couples and Indian couples who have settled abroad . Commercial surrogacy is available in parts of the United States but costs about five times as much as it does in India. Dr Nayna Patel, the medical director of the Akanksha centre, says that affordability is a factor for foreign couples opting for surrogacy in India, but that it is also popular because Indian doctors and medical technology are well-regarded and the poor rural women generally lead clean-living lifestyles. 'The surrogates are considered trustworthy, committed, and the vices like drugs, smoking, and drinking are not seen amongst women,' says Dr Patel. A British couple, who wish to remain anonymous, used the clinic last year after the wife was left unable to have children following a botched operation at a clinic in London. One doctor has spoken out to dismiss concerns often raised that the surrogate mother might become bonded to the child and not want to give the baby up . The couple had a baby girl who was genetically their own through a surrogate in India. The wife, 37, a management consultant, explains that she was apprehensive of using the treatment at first. 'When you're from the West, you don't do this lightly,' she says. 'When we did the research and visited we were reassured that the women were volunteering and it wasn't exploitative. We're obviously very conscious of human rights.' She contacted other clinics in India, which seemed much 'more commercial and pushy', before deciding on the Akanksha Infertility Clinic. She says burst into tears after the surrogate mother and her husband visited the baby a couple of weeks after she was born. The women are screened and selected based on having a healthy uterus. In some case the surrogates will also get a bonus from the couple . The minute a woman delivers the baby is handed over to the genetic parents . 'They were thanking me, which is what made me emotional because they've given me this baby. The surrogate's husband was able to start his own diamond business with the money. 'They're moving into a bigger house. For them, this money means so much. This place actually helps people. Yes, it helps people like myself and my husband, who have been married 11 years and have tried lots of different avenues to have a child. 'We've got the happiness of a lifetime now having this child but it's not just a one-way thing. It helps the surrogates and their families as well.' Dr Jatin Shah has a clinic in Mumbai called the Mumbai Infertility Clinic and IVF Centre, which last year handled the surrogate birth of a baby boy for the Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan. Dr Jatin Shah runs a clinic in Mumbai called the Mumbai Infertility Clinic and IVF Centre, which only serves Indian residents or Indian expats . The clinic oversees about ten surrogate cases a month, but only offers the service to Indian residents or Indian expats. Dr Shah explains that he wants to see a proper surrogacy law in place in India before he starts catering to foreigners. There is an Assisted Reproductive Technologies Bill but the actual law has yet to be passed. Dr Shah explains that there is no issue with finding women who are willing to act as surrogates and that there is a 'long queue' of potential candidates who approach the clinics. They are screened and selected based on having a healthy uterus. The clinic pays surrogates almost 400,000 rupees (£3,860) for carrying a child. In some case the surrogates will also get a bonus from the couple. Dr Shah dismisses concerns often raised that the surrogate mother might become bonded to the child and not want to give the baby up. 'Why should it happen?' he says. 'She needs the money. I haven't heard of a single case yet in India. When you go to the grassroots and talk to the mother, she has two of her own children, she is doing this for the money. 'She has no interest in getting linked up to the child. She can't look after her own, so there is no question of looking after somebody else's child.' They could also face legal challenges in such a situation, Dr Shah explains. 'There's a legal contract between the surrogate mother and the patient, so how will she turn around? And she delivers under the care of the doctor in the nursing home. 'The minute she delivers the baby is handed over to the genetic parents. Unless she absconds in the fifth month and disappears. Why would she do that because she needs that money? 'We've done about a hundred surrogates and they've all just been very happy that they've been paid the promised amount and from that money they could buy their husband a taxi or buy themselves a house or pay for their kids' education. 'That is their motive which we fulfill for them.' There's a legal contract between the surrogate mother and the patient and she delivers under the care of the doctor in the nursing home .","Akanksha Infertility Clinic in .

Foreigners coming to Britain will be charged for emergency treatment on the NHS for the first time as part of a clampdown on health tourism. Migrants who go to A&E will be billed between £20 and £100 for a consultation, on top of the cost of their treatment – with staff presenting chip-and-pin machines at their bedsides. The charges are being brought in amid concerns that the NHS has become an 'international health service', with foreign patients who are not entitled to care racking up costs of £2billion a year. At the bedside? Patients may end up being presented with chip-and-pin machines under new plans to crack down on health tourism . Many travel to the UK specifically for free treatment – yesterday it emerged that in the past two years, 300 heavily pregnant women flew in to Britain through one airport just to give birth in NHS hospitals. Ministers have ruled out making overseas patients pay to see a GP after doctors raised fears this could impact on public health, but migrants will be charged for any follow-up procedures and prescriptions, as well as any care they receive in hospital. Senior doctors said last night that the plans would cause 'confusion' among staff and patients. They said the Government had failed to explain exactly how it would collect the money from foreigners. There is also concern that British patients will be wrongly charged if they cannot prove their nationality – or that the critically ill will be deterred from seeking help because they cannot afford to pay. The fees will be introduced next year and the Department of Health has promised to publish further details on how the new system will work in March. It is thought that patients will be charged between £20 and £100 for an initial consultation – depending on their condition – in addition to the price of any further treatment, scans or operations. Migrants who go to A&E will be billed between £20 and £100 for a consultation, on top of the cost of their treatment . A London Ambulance outside Whittington Hospital Accident and Emergency department . Patients may end up being presented with a chip-and-pin machine before they are allowed to leave and if they fail to pay, officials will try to claw the money back from their home country's government. The move comes after a report revealed the true cost of health tourism is £2billion a year – up to 100 times higher than some previous estimates. Only 16 per cent is clawed back. Health minister Lord Howe said: 'Having a universal health service free at the point of use rightly makes us the envy of the world, but we must make sure the system is fair to the hardworking British taxpayers who fund it. 'We know that we need to make changes across the NHS to better identify and charge visitors and migrants. Introducing charging at primary care is the first step.' Professor J Meirion Thomas said the flow of West African women flying in to give birth for free in London was so common it was referred to by staff as the 'Lagos Shuttle' At present, A&E is free for everyone, along with GP services and treatment for infectious diseases. But foreigners including tourists, illegal immigrants and anyone who has lived here for less than 12 months are meant to pay for hospital treatment, including  X-rays and surgery. In reality, staff fail to recover these costs partly because they have no idea which patients should pay. Ministers also intend to make foreigners pay a £200 tax when they arrive, just in case they need to use the NHS while here. Professor J Meirion Thomas, of the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, said the flow of West African women flying in to give birth for free at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, in  London, was so common it was referred to by staff as the 'Lagos Shuttle'. It was reported yesterday that in just two years at Gatwick, border officials stopped more than 300 foreign women 'arriving in an advanced stage of pregnancy who evidently intend to access NHS maternity services'. Dr Mark Porter, of the British Medical Association, warned that the fees would create 'unintended drawbacks' and 'confusion' for patients and staff. He added: 'There remains a real risk that some migrants and short-term visitors who desperately need care could be discouraged from approaching the NHS if they cannot pay the proposed charges.' Shadow health minister Lord Philip Hunt accused the Government of putting 'spin before substance' by not explaining how the system will work. He added: 'This out-of-touch Government is asking doctors and nurses to act as surrogate immigration officials.'","Migrants billed between £20 and £100 for a consultation at A&E .

David Beckham has suffered the humiliation of being rejected for a knighthood after a row among the officials in charge of honours. Some said he should be made Sir David for his footballing achievements and for helping London to host the 2012 Olympics. But other officials, described by a source as ‘one or two stuffed-shirt snobs’, said it was too soon to make cockney-accented Beckham, 38, a knight of the realm. Sick as a parrot? A knighthood for Beckham has been ruled out for now, leaving Posh a lady in waiting.

But glamorous Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins, 33, is set to receive an OBE – four years after she admitted taking cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis as a student. She is also known for her charity work and has performed concerts in Iraq and Afghanistan for British troops. A vigorous debate took place over whether Beckham should get the nod in this week’s New Year Honours – or be made to wait. In the end, his critics won. ‘There was a view it wouldn’t do him any harm to wait a bit longer,’ said one source. If Beckham is to receive the honour in the future, the entire vetting process will have to start from scratch. Honoured: Glamorous Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins, 33, is set to receive an OBE .

The snub is all the more embarrassing after reports that Beckham’s knighthood was assured. A national newspaper last month suggested the decision had been made. And it claimed football-loving Prince William would knight ‘Sir David’ at Buckingham Palace. Beckham’s name was put forward for a knighthood in May when he announced he was ending his glittering 20-year career as a footballer. He earned 115 England caps and won the Premiership with Manchester United six times. Tony Blair has praised his role in the team of politicians and sports stars that helped London win the right to stage last year’s Olympics.

As recently as last week, asked about reports he was getting a knighthood, Beckham said: ‘I’ve heard a few of these rumours as well but I’m not paying them too much attention. ‘I’m so busy with my kids – I’m just a dad. We’ll see what happens with the knighthood but I’m proud of what I’ve already achieved.’ Waiting game: Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, awarded the OBE last year, was also passed over on the grounds that he should wait for a higher honour . Discussing the prospect of David being knighted, Victoria once said: ‘I’d love that, that would be quite fabulous. It’s just so camp, it’s wonderful isn’t it? Lady Victoria – that would be quite amazing.’ Bookmakers Coral were so certain that Beckham was about to be knighted, they suspended betting on it two weeks ago.

Tesco has been accused of selling 'dirty tuna' in nets that kill rare sharks and turtles by TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall . He told the Sunday Mirror: 'Tesco made one of the biggest commitments of all to sell the most sustainable tuna. But they now stock a new brand called Oriental and Pacific which is caught using methods that accidentally catch and kill endangered animals like turtles, rays and sharks. 'If they really care about our oceans, then Tesco should take this tuna off the shelves today.' In 2011, Tesco pledged that its tuna would be caught by pole and line. However, the documentary claims that soon after, the supermarket giant began to stock the cheaper Oriental and Pacific brand of tuna, caught by nets, and does not . promise to eliminate 'unsustainably caught' tuna from its supply chain.

The annals of legal history are filled with people launching and winning massive payouts for the most extraordinary of reasons. A woman failed with a $3m lawsuit against Starbucks after suffering severe burns after spilling tea on herself. Rachel Moltner, 78, from Manhattan, claimed a double cup served from an outlet of the world's largest coffee chain was defective. She spilled tea onto her left leg and foot when she tried to remove the lid from a 'venti'-sized cup, causing burns that required a skin graft. However, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s dismissal of her claim for damages. Moltner was in a coffee shop on Manhattan’s Upper East Side when the accident happened in February 2008. A case which has gone down in legal folklaw involved Merv Grazinski who set his Winnebago on cruise control, slid away from the wheel and went back to fix a cup of coffee. The Winnebago unsurprisingly crashed. Grazinski blamed the manufacturer of the motor homes, above, for not warning against such a maneuver in the owner's manual. He sued and won $1.75 million. In 2007, a man sued a family-run dry cleaners for more than $65million after it lost one pair of his trousers 5 million for one pair of pants. The Superior Court judge threw out the claim, which he called 'vexatious litigation' and awarded damages to the dry cleaners. In 2006, A man from Portland, Oregon, sued sports giant Nike because he looked like basketball star Michael Jordan. He launched the legal action 'for defamation and permanent injury' - plus $364 million in 'punitive damage for emotional pain and suffering'. He claimed that he was constantly being mistaken for the star - despite being three inches shorter, 25lbs lighter and eight years older than the star. He was convinced to drop the lawsuit by Nike's lawyers. In 2005, A man from Burnsville, Minnesota, sued magicians David Blaine and David Copperfield because, he claimed, the illusionists were using 'godly powers' to defy the laws of physics. He said that since he was God they must 'somehow' be stealing that power from him. The case did not go further.","Webster Lucas claims he was racially abused by a McDonald's manager .

The unique draft was used by the film's star and director to make changes to the dialogue, shaping it into arguably the world's greatest movie. The front page carries the heading 'Mr Welles' Working Copy' along with the original title of the 1941 film 'The American'. The script, dated 1940, is covered in Orson Welles' scrawls as he developed arguably the best film ever . The 1941 film about a newspaper magnate, Welles' first feature, was nominated for nine Academy Awards . Half-way through the 321-page script, the movie title on top of each sheet changes to 'Citizen Kane'. Several pages show how Welles took a pencil to numerous lines and paragraphs of the script, completely deleting great chunks of text at times. The document was owned by the late Stanley Seeger, a wealthy collector of important items. It has now sold at auction in London for £98,500, nearly five times the pre-sale estimate. The unique draft is yellowed and covered in thumb marks. It sold for five times its estimated price . The narrative structure of the masterpiece is thought to be its biggest influence on modern movies . Welles, who co-wrote, directed, produced and starred in the film, tweaked the dialogue for months . Welles played megalomaniac Charles Foster Kane in the film that was originally titled The American . David Macdonald, a director at auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'This document represents a pivotal moment in the making of arguably the greatest modern move made. 'This was Orson Welles' own working script, nothing like this has been seen before. Citizen Kane is widely regarded as the best film ever made that changed the industry forever. Though it was a commercial failure at the box office, it remains every filmmaker's number one. Using his large budget of $500,000, 25-year-old theatre man Orson Welles developed new ways of using complex sound, deep focus and story structure. It was one of the first films to use such dynamic camera angles and optical illusions to tell the story. In many scenes, the ceilings were visible, which was a first for movies as it was previously too difficult to mask the microphones and lights. Welles ordered for them to be covered in black fabric. The non-linear storyline, unconventional ending and elusive protagonist were the main features that shocked the industry into experimentation. 'You can see regularly through the script how he removed paragraphs, scored out lines and tweaked the dialogue as she shaped the movie. 'It throws up a rather romantic vision of him going into his study and taking a pencil to it.' Many of the alterations relate to where the script made obvious references to the US newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, who the character Charles Kane was based on. The most noticeble change was the actual title of the movie, as 'The American' was deemed too close to Hearst, who often attached the same term to his various enterprises. Once the script was approved, crisp copies of the final version would have been printed off and handed to the cast and crew for filming. Welles' working script is dated April 30 to May 9, 1940 - a year before the film came out. It has a slight yellowing to it as well as evidence of it being 'well-thumbed'. Mr Macdonald said eclectic collector Mr Seeger had owned it for more than 20 years before it was sold at auction last week. Sold alongside it was an art-deco cocktail shaker owned and used by gangster Al Capone during prohibition in the US. The silver flask was a gift to Capone from 'the boys' in 1932, shortly before he was jailed for 11 years for tax evasion. The shaker sold at the same auction for £50,000, 50 times the pre-sale estimate.","Unique draft used by actor/director to make changes to dialogue .

FBI Special Agent in Charge Gerald Bessette said Thursday that the task force would be looking at ties between the slayings of five women in San Mateo County dubbed the 'Gypsy Hill Murders' with the murder of Michelle Mitchell, a 19-year-old University of Nevada-Reno nursing student who also was killed in 1976. FBI spokesman Peter Lee says law enforcement officials think the same individual is may be responsible for the killings. Scroll down for video . Murdered: The FBI believes the 1976 murders of Michelle Mitchell (left) and five California women including Tanya Blackwell (right) could be linked . The victims were all young females with brown hair parted down the middle. They all appeared to have been raped and stabbed. The first victim was 18-year-old Veronica Cascio. She was last seen January 7 walking from home to a bus stop before her body was discovered dumped at the Park Golf Course in Pacifica the next day, reports ABC 7. She had been stabbed 32 times and raped. Tanya Blackwell, 14, was last seen January 24 when she left her home for a local 7-Eleven store. She was found in the Gypsy Hills area months later and had almost identical wounds to Cascio. Victims: Veronica Cascio (left) was the first victim; Carol Booth (right), was the fourth .

The final California victim was Denise Lampe, 19, who was found stabbed to death in her car in a parking lot of Serramonte Shopping Center in Daly City. The cosmetics salesgirl had been raped . Now the FBI believes that Mitchell's murder in Reno, is linked to the California crimes. Unsolved: The murders of Paula Baxter (left) and Denise Lamp (right) were never solved . 'The Reno murder occurred in between the time frame of our five murders and recent evidence that's been uncovered leads us to believe that the Reno murder is linked to several of our murders,' Bessette said. Mitchell was last seen on February 24 when her car broke down around 8pm. Someone assisted her in pushing the vehicle off the road and into a parking lot and she called her mother to give her a ride home. But when her mother arrived, Mitchell was nowhere to be seen. Her body was found later that evening in the garage of a local home. Her throat had been slashed and her hands were tied with twine. Mitchell's case was believed solved in 1979, when a woman named Cath Woods confessed to her murder and was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Now, investigators believe Woods was responsible for the murder, but that she had a male accomplice who committed the five California murders.

'In the meantime, we are moving forward.' Stunning: The Breakers, named for the breaking Atlantic waves it overlooks, is one of the most popular historic house museums in the United States . Historic: The estate opened in in 1895, during a time when Newport functioned as the nation's summer social capital, and became the crown jewel in a city populated by mansions . Plans: The Preservation Society's plan calls for a 3,700-square-foot building reminiscent of a conservatory to be built inside a grove of trees, where it says it would not be visible from the house or street. For: The Preservation Society of Newport County, the nonprofit group that owns the 70-room mansion, says the center is badly needed to serve The Breakers' 400,000 annual visitors . The dispute over the welcome center has grown rancorous since the Preservation Society publicly announced the project last year. The neighbors group and members of the Vanderbilt family, including designer Gloria Vanderbilt, have argued against building the center on the estate's grounds, with several arguing a better location would be directly across the street in a parking lot. The society says it has explored the alternatives, but none of them are feasible. Building it across the street would take up too many parking spaces and would be too far away from the house, the group has said. Many of the state's influential economic development and tourism officials have lined up in favor of the project. The National Park Service also weighed in, saying in a letter it was concerned the plan could damage the national historic landmark and asking the group to reconsider. But a few days later, it retracted the letter and apologized for sending it on the eve of a critical vote by the city's zoning board in January. The board ultimately gave the project the go-ahead, overturning a decision by the Historic District Commission that found the project was incompatible with local historic standards. Robert Beaver, who lives near The Breakers and is a member of the neighbors group, said on Monday that the neighbors also plan a separate lawsuit to appeal that zoning board decision. Against:  Many opponents agree something is needed, but they want it across the street in the parking lot or elsewhere, not on the 13-acre grounds of the property, which they say would be irreparably damaged .

Wealthy families from New York and Boston built huge houses with sprawling gardens in Newport in which to holiday in the summer and to entertain guests. They were built during the so-called 'Gilded Age' in American history which was the period roughly from 1877 to the turn of the 20th Century. Among the families who began to build in Newport in the late 19th and early 20th century, were the very wealthy members of America's east coast high society - including the Vanderbilts, Astors and Wideners. Glamour: The Marble House was built between 1888 and 1892 for Alva and William Kissam Vanderbilt. Its construction is credited with helping to transform Newport into a holiday destination for America's wealthiest families . Picturesque: Chateau-sur-Mer was built as a French-style villa for William Shepard Wetmore, a merchant in the China trade. It is now open to the public as a museum . The buildings became key symbols of . status within New York high society, with families trying to outdo each . other with the expense and beauty of their homes. The mansions, which were known, ironically perhaps, as 'cottages,' costs tens of thousands of dollars to build (millions of dollars in today's money) and boasted features such as marble floors and fire places, palladian columns, electricity and other luxuries of the time. Perhaps the finest of these houses was The Breakers which was built in 1895. The grandiose Marble House, which was built between 1888 and 1892 by the Vanderbilts, is credited with helping to attract other wealthy families to follow suit by building holiday homes in Newport. Design: Built between 1881 and 1883, The Isaac Bell House, Newport, is considered to be one of the finest Shingle Style houses in the US . Finery: Built between 1898 and 1902, Rosecliff was built by Theresa Fair Oelrichs - a 'silver heiress' from Nevada . Families came to Newport for the social season holding grand parties. However, for all their grandeur, the houses often had relatively few bedrooms, as the guests were expected to have their own property nearby. Many of the mansions . were designed by the renowned New York-based architect Richard Morris Hunt, who had a house in Newport himself. Many of the mansions remain in private use, although a number are now card for by the Preservation Society of Newport County.

Saajid Badat will testify live via videotape from London at the New York trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith about his experiences with al-Qaida after the attacks that demolished the World Trade Center. Some of the lawyers in the case flew to London on Friday to pose questions. Defendant Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, right, is seated with al-Qaida founder Osama Bin Laden, center, and Bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, in Afghanistan . Saajid Badat will testify live via videotape from London at the New York trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith . Prosecutors are using the testimony to . try to show that Abu Ghaith knew of al-Qaida's plans when he promised in . videotapes sent across the world in the weeks after the September 11 . attacks that ""the storm of airplanes will not abate"" against Americans . and advised Muslims in America and Great Britain to stay off aircraft. Abu Ghaith, born in Kuwait, faces a possible life prison sentence if he is convicted of conspiring to kill Americans and of providing material support to al-Qaida. His trial began in federal court in Manhattan last week, a year after he was captured in Turkey and brought to the United States for trial. About five years ago, he married bin Laden's eldest daughter, Fatima. Badat was expected to testify Monday after defense lawyers cross-examine another witness, Sahim Alwan. The Lackawanna, N.Y., man testified Friday that he met bin Laden three times and heard Abu Ghaith speak to al-Qaida recruits while undergoing training in Afghanistan several months before the 2001 attacks. Alwan pleaded guilty in 2003 to providing material support to terrorists by attending bin Laden's al-Farooq camp and served about seven years in prison. Badat was convicted in London in a 2001 plot to down an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami with explosives hidden in his shoes. In videotaped testimony shown to a jury in Brooklyn at a 2012 terrorism trial, Badat said he refused a request to testify in person in the U.S. because he remains under indictment in Boston on charges he conspired with failed shoe-bomber Richard Reid, and he has been told he'd be arrested if he set foot in the United States. Abu Ghaith, 48, a onetime imam at a Kuwaiti mosque, has pleaded not guilty in the case. Abu Ghaith is the highest-ranking al-Qaida figure to face trial on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11 attacks.

Miss McFadden has 10 medals from the last three Summer Paralympic Games in wheelchair racing. Last year, she won the first ‘grand slam’ in wheelchair marathon racing - which refers to winning titles at all four major 26.2-mile races including Boston, Chicago, London and New York. Deborah McFadden adopted Tatyana at age six and originally expected the winnings from the Boston, Chicago, London and New York marathons to be spent on a new car. Instead the money was used to bring Tatyana’s birth family and the St. Petersburg orphanage director to Sochi. ‘Tatyana's my daughter, but it's taken a lot of people to get her where she is today,’ said Deborah McFadden.

A Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman was arrested Sunday for attacking two people in a Florida strip club. Reserve offensive lineman Jah Reid, 25, is accused of attacking customer Edmond Mussa and bouncer David Smith in a violent rampage just before 2am. at the Red Garter Saloon in Key West. The fight started after Mussa bumped into Reid and the two exchanged words, police told The Keynoter. Smith jumped in the middle of the two fighting and was punched in the face by Reid, authorities said. Reid is third Ravens player arrested since last month. All-out brawl: Jah Reid (left) savegely beat customer Edmond Moussa before punching bouncer David Smith (right) in the face during an early Sunday morning strip club melee . The 6ft7 335-pound Reid mistakenly bumped Moussa in the bar, witnesses told police. The footballer then headbutted the 21-year-old after a heated exchange. Reid repeatedly punched Mussa until he was on the ground, a Key West Police Department arrest report cited by the paper said. The 2013 Super Bowl champ then repeatedly kicked the man while he lie on the ground until Smith tried to break up the fight, said the report. Reid then reportedly punched the bouncer in the face as friend Benjamin Buxton, 23, jumped in to finish off Mussa, cops said. Trouble in paradise: Reid and Buxton fought at this strip in Key West . Buxton repeatedly punched Mussa until another bouncer was able to pull him away from the battered man. The second bouncer was then attacked by Buxton, said police. The fracas was only stopped when one of the two men was shot with a Taser, police said, according to Local 10. Reid claimed to police that he was choked by one of the bouncers, sources told the station. Investigators plan to review security footage to determine the exact series of events, but have charged both Reid and Buxton with multiple misdemeanor counts of battery.

Stunning new images of Mars' ‘Grand Canyon’ have been captured in 3D by the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Mars Express. The deep valley, named Hebes Chasma, is a strange 196-mile (315km) scar that sits almost right in the middle of the Martian equator on the northern edge of the Valles Marineris canyon. It is an enclosed, almost 8 km-deep trough stretching 315 km in an east–west direction and 125 km from north to south at its widest point. Scroll down for video... The deep valley, named Hebes Chasma, is a strange 196-mile (315km) scar that sits almost right in the middle of the Martian equator on the northern edge of the Valles Marineris canyon. Numerous grooves are etched into the mountain, suggesting the material is weak and easily eroded . Scientists hope that Hebes Chasma and its neighbouring network of canyons could provide new insights into Mars’ ancient geological upheaval. Esa’s Mars Express has flown over this region of Mars on numerous occasions, but this new eight-image mosaic reveals Hebes Chasma in full and in greater detail than ever before. By imaging the landscape at three different wavelengths, the space agency has provides an insight into how the canyon will look from various angles. Ripped apart by tectonic forces, the origin of Hebes Chasma and neighbouring canyons is associated with the nearby volcanic Tharsis Region, a huge region on Mars formed during its ancient volcanic history. A horseshoe-shaped chunk has been taken out of one side of the mound (left in this image); the material has slumped down onto the floor of the valley below. A dark patch appears to pool like spilt ink across the debris. It is most likely loose material that has slid down the walls from an intermediate layer . The mosaic of Hebes Chasma is composed of eight single images taken with the High Resolution Stereo Camera on Mars Express (left). Scientists hope that Hebes Chasma and its neighbouring network of canyons could provide new insights into Mars' ancient geological upheaval. A colour-coded topography map (right) shows the relative heights and depths of features in and around the Hebes Chasma. White and red show the highest terrains, while blue and purple show the deepest . As the Tharsis bulge swelled with magma during the planet’s first billion years, the surrounding crust was stretched, eventually ripping apart and collapsing into massive troughs. One of these was Hebes Chasma, and the complex fault patterns can be seen all around the deep depression and are especially evident in the main colour and 3D images. At the centre of Hebes Chasma is a flat-topped ‘mesa’- an elevated area of land with a flat top and sides. No other canyon on Mars has a similar feature and its origin is not entirely clear. Its layers include volcanic materials but also wind-blow dust and lake sediments that were laid down over time. By imaging the landscape at three different wavelengths, the space agency has provides an insight into how the canyon will look from various angles. Ripped apart by tectonic forces, the origin of Hebes Chasma and neighbouring canyons is associated with the nearby volcanic Tharsis Region . A horseshoe-shaped chunk has been taken out of one side of the mesa where material has slumped down onto the valley floor below. A similar feature is visible at the opposite end of the mound, as seen in the full-colour image. Other landslide deposits are seen all over the floor of Hebes Chasma, many coming from the main canyon walls. The canyon walls and the mesa feature a number of grooves, suggesting the material is weak and easily eroded. In another image, a band of darker material is seen between two layers of light material. The Hebes Chasma is located at about 1°S / 284°E, and 300 km north of Valles. Its layers include volcanic materials but also wind-blow dust and lake sediments that were laid down over time . One idea is that the material was blown or slid from the top of the mound and collected on the slopes below. Dark material is also seen around the base of the mesa, which either eroded away from the younger sediment layers located higher up in the mesa, or were deposited separately by wind or water. Other layers revealed in the sides of the mesa may also have been deposited by water. Data from both Mars Express and Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal that some parts of Hebes Chasma are laced with minerals that can form only in the presence of water, suggesting that at some point in the Red Planet’s history the canyon might have been filled with a lake. According to Esa, however, the chaotic debris that fills the canyon floor shows that enormous landslides also played a key role in shaping and widening this deep scar since its formation.","Hebes Chasma is a 196-mile scar that sits close to the Martian equator .

A council has been slapped down by health and safety chiefs after it refused to clear up dog mess in a playground because of the risk it posed to workers. Officials at Trafford, Greater Manchester, had said that telling groundsmen to clear faeces from the play area in Altrincham, a well-to-do suburb, could expose them to disease. Parents who asked the council to take action over the mess were told: 'Unfortunately, the Council's grounds maintenance team are not allowed to tackle dog fouling by hand (including spades) for health and safety reasons.' Risk: Officials at Trafford, Greater Manchester, had said that telling groundsmen to clear faeces from a play area like this one in Altrincham, a well-to-do suburb, could expose them to disease. (Stock image) Furious at the refusal, the parents complained to the Health and Safety Executive's Mythbusters Panel, which ruled that Trafford had used an 'unjustified health and safety reason for not clearing up the dog fouling.' HSE chairman Judith Hackitt, who heads the Mythbusters Panel, said that it was 'right and proper' that council workers should clean up the playground to protect children from the potentially hazardous waste. 'There are no rules which prevent this and the precautions needed to protect workers are simple and straightforward,' she told The Sun. 'Refusing to clean up is just unhelpful.' Andrew Caine, a father who was among the parents who brought the complaint against Trafford, said that council officials had agreed to build a wall around the playground to stop dogs coming in and using it as a toilet. He said he was satisfied with the decision and would not take the complaint any further. 'Just unhelpful': The decision by Trafford, whose HQ is pictured, was reversed after a complaint . Rebuke: Health and Safety Executive chairman Judith Hackitt, left, and Welfare Minister Mike Penning, right, have both been in touch with the council to tell it that its workers are responsible for clearing up mess . The HSE's Mythbusters Panel challenges the incorrect use of health and safety rules. It said in its decision: 'In this case those most at risk from the behaviour of irresponsible dog owners are children.

Battle: Jack Blades, 16, is fighting for his life after taking Mortal Kombat pills at a house party . A teenager has been arrested for alleged drugs offences after two boys were taken to hospital having taken 'Mortal Kombat' ecstasy tablets. A 16-year-old - named locally as Jack Blades - remains in a serious but stable condition in intensive care after taking a pill at a house party in Coatbridge, near Glasgow, on Saturday night. A 17-year-old who came to the hospital with him was discharged following tests. It's believed the teenagers swallowed red 'Mortal Kombat' ecstasy tablets at the party - the type linked to the death of 17-year-old Regane MacColl from Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire last month. Police Scotland said a 16-year-old boy has been arrested and is expected to appear at Airdrie Sheriff Court tomorrow. Mr Blade and his unidentified friend were admitted to Monklands District General Hospital in Airdrie at about 11.30pm on Saturday evening, a police spokesperson added. The illegal drugs they had taken included ecstasy and 'possibly' a Mortal Kombat tablet, the spokesperson went on to say. The distinctive red tablet with a dragon image imprinted on it is an ecstasy-style drug and is thought to have been responsible for the death of Miss MacColl last month. The 17-year-old died after taking one of the tablets at Glasgow . nightspot The Arches on February 1. Warnings issued about the red pills following Miss MacColl's death were renewed yesterday. Dr Neil Howie, NHS Lanarkshire Consultant in Emergency Medicine, said: 'We cannot stress highly enough that anyone who takes an illicit drug is putting their health, and indeed their life, in jeopardy. Users can never actually be sure of what they are taking and what the contents are.' 'We would urge anyone who has taken an ecstasy tablet, and in particularly Mortal Kombat, who feels unwell to seek urgent medical advice and treatment from their local hospital.' Warning: 16-year-old Jack Blades is in a serious condition after police believe he took a Mortal Kombat pill . Tragic: Regane MacColl died after taking mortal kombat in a Glasgow nightclub, The Arches, last month . 'Mortal Kombat' tablets are particularly lethal because they contain an active ingredient called PMA. PMA is five-times stronger than MDMA - ecstasy's typical active ingredient - but takes far longer to kick in, meaning young and inexperienced users will often take extra pills while waiting to feel the effects. As with all street drugs, Mortal Kombat tablets may also be cut with a whole host of other substances - including dangerous chemicals - so even experienced users can never be 100 per cent sure what they are actually taking. PMA is sold for as little as £3, and usually comes as red or pink Love Hearts sweet-shaped pills that are stamped with an 'M' or a image of a dragon. The drug is also occasionally sold as powder. PMA often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to MDMA. It has been linked to multiple deaths, in the UK, Canada, Norway and Denmark. 'Early warning signs include a feeling . of agitation and distress and it is important that people are seen as . early as possible if they experience any of these symptoms,' Dr Howie went on to say. Police Scotland's Inspector . Paul Livingstone added: 'Further to previous warnings, I would again . strongly advise people to avoid illicit drugs as their exact content is . unknown and can contain dangerous chemicals. Users must be aware of . these dangers and understand the devastating effect they can have.' Currently, the full ingredients of the so-called Mortal Kombat pill remain unknown, but drug experts have warned it may contain . another substance called PMA, which was blamed for the deaths of more . than 10 young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester last year. PMA is sold in pills costing as little as £3 or in a crystal-like form, are sometimes pink and shaped like Love Hearts sweets, or stamped with an 'M'. The drug often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to ecstasy's main chemical, MDMA. But the active ingredient in PMA is five times stronger and takes longer to kick in, meaning many revellers take extra pills. PMA has been linked to multiple deaths, both in the UK and in Canada, Norway and Denmark. Detective Inspector Debbie Johnstone, of Coatbridge CID, appealed for anyone with information about the supply of illegal mortal kombat drugs to come forward.

Close: Kirsty Wark pictured with her daughter Caitlin Clements, 23, who wants to follow in her mother's footsteps to become a journalist . The daughter of Kirsty Wark has told how her mother struggled with the guilt of being a working parent. Caitlin Clements, 23, said the Newsnight presenter ‘put herself through the wringer’ whenever she missed her two children’s precious moments growing up. And she revealed that her mother – who has spent the past 20 years commuting between Glasgow and London – often over-compensated for her absence by baking at the weekends. The university student, however,  said she and her brother James, 21, never felt the ‘separation’ Miss Wark suffered as a result of working away, and were lucky to have a hands-on father in TV producer Alan Clements. Opening up in an interview, Miss Clements said: ‘For some reason mum’s always struggled with guilt about working – the cooking and the baking is part of that. But she doesn’t have anything to feel guilty about. Dad was very hands-on when my brother James and I were growing up, so we got the best of both of them.’ She told how she enjoyed plenty of time with her father, saying: ‘On Friday nights we had a routine – we’d do a big Tesco shop, then we’d go swimming and, on the way home, we’d get pizza and watch Friends together.’ Miss Clements said her mother always rushed back home to Scotland for the weekends, adding: ‘Mum always put herself through the wringer. ‘She’d run for the train after filming Newsnight so she could be back in Glasgow for 7am on Saturday … I think Mum felt the separation more than we did. She’s always running about 100 miles per hour.’ Guilty conscience: Caitlin Clements, 23, admits her mother Kirsty Wark struggled with the guilt of working and missing family events . Miss Wark, 59, has previously described herself a ‘helicopter parent, always hovering’. She was pregnant with Caitlin when she famously interviewed Margaret Thatcher on BBC Scotland in 1990. By the time her daughter was born, she was already working freelance and quickly went back to working part-time. She joined BBC2’s Newsnight in 1993, a year after her son James was born. Yesterday Miss Clements told The Sunday Times Magazine how her mother would insist on home baking – recently going as far as arriving from the London to Edinburgh sleeper train with a homemade birthday cake. Following in her mother’s footsteps, Miss Clements is studying journalism and writes a fashion column for a Scottish newspaper.","Caitlin Clements, 23, admits her mother struggled with guilt over working .

At an hour on Sunday when civilised people are untopping the sherry decanter after Matins, that spongy-wet curate Nick Clegg stepped in front of a gathering in York. ‘Rally’ was not quite the word. Sunday school was more the level. The modernist Barbican centre offered the Deputy Prime Minister a smallish space. Word has it that his Whitehall office may be bigger than this venue. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg used his speech to his party conference in York to insist he loves Britain . The back wall was tinged orange, although the faces of his worried, earnest audience were closer to car-sick green. Lucky devils, they had been given a warm-up speech by Lorely Burt MP. The slogan ‘#whyIamIN’ decorated the scenery flats behind Mr Clegg. Did they mean ‘#whyIamNICK’? It may make sense as a Twitter hashtag (whatever that might be) but as a conference-platform motto it jolted the eye. Since last autumn, Mr Clegg has been describing the Lib Dems as ‘the party of IN’, in reference to his party’s pro-Europe stance. It only ever reminds me of Monty Python and ‘the knights who say NI’. ‘Since I became Deputy Prime Minister,’ he began, just to make sure that we realised this was all about him. Mr Clegg said the Liberal Democrats must remain in government after the next election to ensure that Britain is not dragged backwards by the Tories or Labour . He described how he had been round the world, representing us. The US, South Korea, Mexico, Colombia, Ethiopia: all these places had been visited by our hero. I am sure they were amazed. ‘I love Britain,’ he said. Brace yourselves, team – patriotic guff incoming. ‘I love it for all its contradictions. I love that we are as modest as we are proud. I love that we insist on queuing when we go abroad, even when the locals don’t.’ Pause. ‘I love Miriam telling me that the feeling of freedom you get in Britain simply doesn’t exist anywhere else.’ The castanet clacker, since you ask, was not in attendance. Mr Clegg has never been the most inventive orator. David Cameron has done this sort of ‘I love Britain’ spiel. Hugh Grant did it when he played a PM on screen. Me-too Cleggy was late to the game. He loved the shipping forecast, Private Eye, the Premier League, the European Convention on Human Rights. Eh? Are we sure about that last one? Best of British? A pair of flip-flips, one of the items on a list of things Nick Clegg likes about the UK . One of his grandfathers stood on the roof of Westminster Abbey at the end of the Great War and watched the troops returning from the Western Front. ‘He passionately believed that to be a British soldier, defending our values of liberty and peace was the most noble thing you could be,’ said the Europhile Clegg. ‘Smart, funny, compassionate Britain,’ said the half-Dutch Cleggster. Following which, he segued into a passage about the rise of ‘extremist parties’ in Europe: Hungary’s Jobbik party, Bulgaria’s Ataka, Holland’s PVV party. All that stood between us and these parties of anti-Brussels barbarianism was Maestro Clegg. One fairly reliable rule of politics is that the truth is the opposite of what a party leader says in speeches to conferences. In a speech in York Mr Clegg listed what he likes about modern Britain . Thus, when Mr Clegg said yesterday that ‘the Liberal Democrats are now Britain’s only party of in’, he was in fact talking baloney. Labour are wildly pro-Brussels. The Tories, though sceptical, still currently think we should be in the EU (although they would give us a referendum). The Greens are pro-Europe, big time. So the Lib Dems are by no means the ‘only party of in’. Mr Clegg, attacking Eurosceptics, deplored ‘stuffy parochialism dressed up as patriotism’. But the radicalism of those who would give the voters a referendum on Europe is surely not ‘stuffy’. Is it not more drearily Establishment to want to leave the EU as it is? Mr Clegg knocked the ‘ungenerous, backwards-looking politics’ of Eurosceptics. Yet is it not ‘backwards’ to resist any thought of greater national liberty? Someone he doesn't like: Mr Clegg took aim at rivals, including Ukip leader Nigel Farage (pictured) as the pint-drinking, smiling face of an 'ungenerous, backwards-looking politics' And hang on. Why attack UKIP? They are the best bet that the Left has of beating the Tories. Clegg should be loving UKIP! He ended by throwing out a few words: ‘The future not the past. Forward not back. Hope not fear.’ Such platitudes are uttered by the leaders of political parties everywhere – possibly even South Korea, Mexico, Colombia or Ethiopia. As a slogan they were no more convincing than ‘#whyIamIN’. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nick Clegg performed his speech to a crowd in the Barbican Centre, York .

A 32-year-old man has become so overweight that doctors have warned he could be dead within three years if he doesn't change his lifestyle. At his heaviest, Martyn Richardson weighed 26 stone after a lifetime of being overweight. His huge frame means he now suffers from crippling arthritis in his knees - meaning exercising in order to lose weight is virtually impossible. Struggle: Martyn Richardson's huge 22st frame means he now suffers from crippling arthritis in his knees - meaning exercising in order to lose weight is virtually impossible. He is hoping that acupuncture from Dr Jane Schindler (left) will get him moving again . He is now stuck in a vicious cycle where steroid pain relief causes him to gain weight - compounding the problem further. But if he doesn't lose half his body weight, his future is extremely bleak. Martyn features in a new series of Channel 5's Big Body Squad, which follows the lives of those . who are so large they cannot carry out everyday tasks, as well as the . expert help they draft in. For the first time in history, obesity is killing more people than malnutrition. Around 15 million Britons are obese and it is estimated that this will cost the UK a staggering £27 billion by 2016. At just 32 years of age and now weighing 22 stone, Martyn's body has virtually given up on him. Viewers follow him as he meets experts who will try and help him get thin - and get his life back on track. Martyn's osteoarthritis is a prime example of how being overweight can drastically age the body. With the joints of a 60-year-old, he struggles to walk and exercise is excruciatingly painful. Martyn features in a new series of Channel 5's Big Body Squad, which follows the lives of those who such as Denise Ecclestone (pictured) who is so large she can't get out of bed . He tells the programme: 'My consultant told me if I continued as I was, then I'd be dead within three years. 'Like lots of young people, I thought my weight gain was a phase and I'd sort it out later in life. I started gaining weight in my teens and it went up each year. 'I kept thinking I'll lose it, but it just carried on. I was never really active and ate a lot of takeaways. 'It got to the point where my doctor said something needed to be done - or I'd die.' Faced with this stark choice, Martyn desperately began to lose some weight - and has so far managed 4st. But he soon found himself in agony. 'The longer I walk, the more it feels like I'm dragging a dead lead weight around. 'I need to exercise to lose weight, but the more I do, the more painful my knee joints become. The programme also features other obese people receiving the services of the Big Body Squad, such as 30st Steve Wilson, involved in a car crash.  Britain's emergency services are increasingly called upon to deal with larger and larger casualties . 'Steroid injections to relieve the pain make me gain weight - putting more pressure on my knees - and causing me more pain.' Desperate to find a solution, Martyn visits Dr Jane Schindler, a musculo-skeletal expert based in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. She gives him acupuncture to try and break the cycle of weight gain and pain - before his joints age any further. If successful, the acupuncture will relieve his need for painkillers. Despite his phobia of needles, Martyn has the treatment, which involves needles being inserted into pressure points near the sore and damaged affected areas. Treatment: Martyn has undergone acupuncture to try and relax his sore muscles and improve his mobility . Dr Schindler explains that although acupuncture is proven to relive pain, how it does this is still a mystery. She explains: 'I am for trigger points in the muscle to try and relax it - and it seems to help with mobility and pain relief.' The treatment should also strengthen muscles around the area, so they are less painful. With obesity soaring, her services are in demand - and at £45 a session, they are cheaper than many services provided to patients such as Martyn. The programme also features other obese people receiving the services of the Big Body Squad, .

As they attempt to get him out, the crew are forced to reduce his car to scrap metal. The series features a secret and steadily growing number of Britons that live as prisoners in their own home.

The Metropolitan Police was today accused of withholding information about thousands of crimes unless specifically asked about them by journalists. Almost half the crimes logged with the force's press bureau were listed as 'if asked', meaning they were only to be disclosed if a reporter heard about them elsewhere and asked for confirmation. The revelation has raised concerns about transparency, with Labour MP Keith Vaz warning the system could be abused to hide stories that might be embarrassing to Scotland Yard. Headquarters: Almost half the crimes logged with Scotland Yard's press bureau were logged as 'if asked' It has come to light after information about a breach of security at Buckingham Palace, regarded as the most embarrassing in three decades, was not released to the media. After a Freedom of Information request by The Times, Scotland Yard revealed that 4,877 of the 9,906 crimes recorded with its press office in the five months to February were logged 'if asked'. A spokesman for the force insisted that many were only labelled as such at first, then made available to reporters once more-complete information about them was available. Many of the logs, the spokesman said, were not appropriate for widespread disclosure as they related to local crime. The disclosure of the practice comes amid concerns about the transparency of the police and criminal justice system. Scotland .

Worries: The revelation has raised concerns about transparency, with Labour MP Keith Vaz warning the system could be abused to hide stories that might be embarrassing to Scotland Yard . Dozens of convictions are now believed to be at risk after officers failed to reveal the activities of undercover agents to their courts. And the secrecy issues do not only affect the Met. Last week there was criticism of the National Crime Agency after it emerged that it had not informed the public of the arrest of a No 10 aide three weeks earlier.

Even after the Press learned of Patrick Rock's arrest over suspected child pornography offences on February 13 the agency, known as Britain's FBI, refused to confirm it had happened. Mr Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the lack of transparency worried him. 'The sheer number does indicate that there must be important issues buried under the avalanche of cases,' he added. Scotland Yard's spokesman said it was 'misleading' to suggest that the 'if asked' system meant that information was being withheld from the public. 'In many cases it is simply a record of a response already given to a journalist,' the spokesman said.","Half of crimes logged with Met Police press bureau listed as 'if asked'

Here, Sportsmail's Adrian Durham tells us why we should rally behind Brendan Rodgers' team in their bid to lift the league trophy for the first time since 1990. 10 – Liverpool are the only title contenders who have yet to win the Premier League since it began in 1992. Someone new would be refreshing and welcome. Manchester City emerged because of Sheik Mansour’s millions, same with Chelsea and Roman Abramovich. If Liverpool emerge as a title-winning force they will have done it with tactics and brilliant football, more than money. Winning formula: Steven Gerrard deserves to be a title-winning captain, according to Adrian Durham . Star quality: Andre Schurrle and Eden Hazard are just two of the big-money purchases at Chelsea . You too: City lifted their first trophy of the season after beating Sunderland in the Capital One Cup . 9 – Liverpool provide several examples of how the crucial thing in life is not the mistakes we all make, but how we respond to those mistakes. Brendan Rodgers failed at Reading, he was sacked after five wins in 21 games and threatened with relegation. But he rebuilt himself as a manager and bounced back. Then: Brendan Rodgers while at Reading . Now: Rodgers during the Southampton match . Reborn: Jordan Henderson has been pivotal for Liverpool this season so far . Derided: Henderson's £20m price tage was questioned when he moved to Anfield from Sunderland . Jordan Henderson is also worth a mention here. He received heavy criticism after signing for Liverpool. The £16million price tag didn’t help. But he stayed strong, played his football and has come through it as a professional footballer who now commands respect for his conduct on and off the field. 8 – It would be a massive advertisement for coaching in this country. Brendan Rodgers is, of course, from Northern Ireland. But he learned his trade in the English game. Twenty years ago he was combining coaching in the Reading Academy with working as assistant groundsman at the training ground (the head groundsman was Steve Kean!). Rodgers did the legwork, learned his trade, soaked up knowledge and look where he is now. Tactical genius. That’s what Brendan Rodgers is. Look at the way Liverpool took control on Saturday at Southampton after half-time. A lot of managers have been praised . this season for showing tactical prowess but none can top what Rodgers . has done. He’s changed formation from game to game and during matches. But . more impressive than that, he’s devised a system to allow good players . to flourish and enjoy their football. Tactically . Rodgers has shown good results can be achieved by playing open and . entertaining football. You might think that’s not so special or unique – . other managers play good football and are doing as well as Liverpool. True. But Rodgers is . the only manager to play an expansive, tactically brave game at the same . time as managing the high expectations at a club starting at such a low . base. Had he shown fear, and been more cautious, Liverpool wouldn’t be . so good to watch, and players like Luis Suarez wouldn’t want to hang . around at the club. To go from finishing seventh and 28 . points behind the champions, to launching a title challenge at the same . time as playing such an open entertaining game is the mark of tactical . brilliance. 111340 . 26193 . 98732 . Too strong: Luis Suarez (right) and Liverpool brushed aside a good Southampton side last weekend . Rampant: Daniel Sturridge spearheaded the attack in the rout of Arsenal at Anfield . 7 – The football Liverpool play is a joy to watch. They’ve hit some of the most spectacular passes of the season so far: Steven Gerrard’s breathtaking ball through to Daniel Sturridge for the Reds’ first goal in the 3-2 win at Fulham; Raheem Sterling’s stunning defence splitter for Sturridge’s opener in the 4-3 win against Swansea recently; Henderson’s back heel for Sturridge’s goal against Aston Villa; and Coutinho’s amazing ball through to Sturridge for the fourth when they blitzed Arsenal. Rodgers’ Liverpool are all about beautiful passing, fluid movement and great finishing. Yes there’s some bad defending but how can a team with a policy of scoring more than the opposition – no matter how many the opposition score – be criticised? That’s entertainment. Licence to thrill: Sturridge celebrates after latching on to a wonderful ball from Steven Gerrard at Fulham . 6 – Anfield will reignite fans’ passion at the very top of the game if Liverpool win the title. Some stadiums are quiet and soulless but not Anfield. If the Premier League champions have fans behind them showing true emotion to encourage their team then others will surely follow suit. Even Old Trafford can be a quiet place. Just look at Liverpool’s home record since Rodgers took over – the fans have played a major part. Backed: Liverpool's home record has been sensational this season, in part thanks to the Anfield crowd . Passion: Liverpool fans have a restored belief that they could snatch the title from City, Chelsea or Arsenal . 5 – They have shown other clubs who aren’t in the Champions League annually that you don’t have to sell your best players to the so-called bigger boys. Suarez looked all set to leave last summer but Liverpool and John W Henry dug in their heels and kept their man. Suarez certainly isn’t regretting that decision to stay and sign a new contract now. On his way? Suarez threatened to leave the club after being derided for a series of unsavoury incidents . Digging in his heels: John W Henry played a key role in keeping Suarez at the club . 4 – If Liverpool win the title, that will motivate Everton even more. And if both Merseyside clubs are fighting hard for success then football in this country will be in a very healthy place. The bulk of my football education happened in the 1980s when Everton and Liverpool took it in turns to be the kings of English football. Both played fantastic football, and had fantastic success at home and abroad. I can’t wait for that rivalry to be resumed at the very top level of the game. Imagine Everton taking on Liverpool home and away in a Champions League semi-final. If you love football you would just salivate at that possibility. If Liverpool win the title, the pressure will be on Everton and Roberto Martinez to raise their game. This country needs both clubs to be successful. Young talent: Everton have been in fine fettle thanks to Romelu Lukaku (left) and Ross Barkley (right) Back in vogue: The Liverpool v Everton rivalry is one of the fiercest in football . 3 – Liverpool are historically one of England’s finest clubs. They are known globally, they have a rich history of success in Europe that is recognised across the world of football. They belong in the elite. They SHOULD be back competing with the very best in Europe. That’s where Liverpool Football Club belongs. Anyone who knows their football history would agree. Five European Cups – no English side can match that. 2 – Steven Gerrard deserves to be a title-winning captain. He’s one of the finest players this country has ever produced: he’s got character, strength to go with his ability and quality. He’s a winner – he showed that in 2005. But he’s not had enough players around him to secure the Premier League title he so richly deserves. Gerrard has stayed at Liverpool his whole career with the dream of winning the title – he could have gone anywhere but didn’t. If you’ve read his autobiography you’ll know how he talks time and time again about the 'love affair' he has with Liverpool FC. And the devastation he felt when he thought the club didn’t want him to stay in the aftermath of the triumph in Istanbul. What a reward it would be for Gerrard’s loyalty if they finally won the Premier League title this season. Captain, leader, legend: Gerrard has been a great servant for Liverpool and deserves a Premier League trophy . National prowess: England skipper Gerrard is currently with Roy Hodgson's squad . 1 – Liverpool Football Club have nurtured a core of brilliant young English players. Teenager Sterling looks a certainty to go to the World Cup in my view. Why would Roy Hodgson leave such a talent at home? He’s playing well, scoring and making goals, he’s a game-changer, and a potential match-winner. A year ago people were suggesting he needed a loan spell in the Championship. The improvement has been amazing. He has to be a serious contender for Young Player of the Year. Another World Cup certainty in my opinion has to be Henderson. Rodgers has trusted him and he has emerged as a gifted midfielder who can pass the ball and has a goal in him. Sturridge was a goal machine waiting to explode. City and Chelsea held him back – but at Liverpool he has catapulted himself onto the big stage in a massive way. 28 goals in 29 Premier League starts is a world-class statistic. Take a bow: Sturridge (right) and Suarez are the most prolific strike partnership in the Premier League . Call him up! Jon Flanagan battles with Wayne Routledge during the match against Swansea . Jon Flanagan has seized his chance at full back. Fans of most clubs love a local lad to come through the ranks and make it in the first team. Liverpool have produced legends in recent years. Flanagan has brought dynamism to the team, and I am stunned that neither Roy Hodgson nor Gareth Southgate saw fit to pick him for international duty this week. It’s a huge oversight, and when I interviewed him on Monday Flanagan admitted he was disappointed. Liverpool are on course to contribute Sturridge, Henderson and Sterling to the World Cup cause this summer. And the England captain as well. That’s impressive. If the title goes to Anfield it’s a victory for Liverpool. But it’s also a victory for football, and for England.","Liverpool battling City, Arsenal and Chelsea for Premier League title .

The makers of Full & Slim claim that of 500 women who drank it before every meal, 70 per cent lost a stone or more in six weeks (file picture) It sounds too good to be true. A diet drink which claims to help people lose up to a stone in weight by mimicking the actions of a gastric band is to go on sale in Britain. The makers of Full & Slim say it works by expanding in the stomach to convince the drinker that he or she is full. They claim it can help overweight people lower their cholesterol, absorb fats more efficiently and reduce their chance of developing diabetes. The drink contains l-carnitine, an amino acid which helps burn fat in the body and turn it into energy, and glucomannan, a natural ‘super-fibre’ derived from the tuberous roots of the konjac plant. When glucomannan comes into contact with water in the intestine it increases in volume, becoming almost gel-like, causing food to move more slowly through the digestive system. This, in turn, helps control levels of sugar in the bloodstream. The makers say that of 500 women who drank the supplement before each meal, around 70 per cent lost a stone or more in weight within six weeks. Even women who simply took the drink, without dieting or completing any exercise, lost up to 3lbs a week.Full & Slim director James Harrington said: ‘The combination of ingredients suppresses appetite and mimics the effects of a gastric band, without undergoing the trauma of invasive surgery.’ However experts are sceptical about the benefits of natural foods and supplements that claim to speed up weight loss, with many studies claiming over-the-counter drinks and shakes produce no more weight loss than a placebo. But one recent survey found that, on average, volunteers given 4g of glucomannan a day for five weeks recorded a 5.1 per cent reduction in body weight, as well as a 5.54 per cent drop in their body mass index and 14 per cent drop in cholesterol. L-caratine in the drink expands the stomach, making the drinker feel full, similar to a gastric band (pictured) By contrast, slimmers offered a dummy drug or placebo reported drops in weight of just 1.93 per cent, a 1.97 per cent fall in BMI and 12 per cent drop in cholesterol. The drinks, which come in fruit-flavoured sachets, cost around £1.38 each or £28.95 for 21. Slimmers are advised to drink one with water 30 minutes before every meal. They will be sold at Boots from next month. Last month scientists revealed they had developed an implant containing genetically engineered cells which could replace the need for gastric band surgery. It responds to fat in the bloodstream by producing a hormone signal that tells the brain: ‘You’re full, stop eating’.","Full & Slim is a new health drink containing amino acid l-caratine .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:41 EST, 9 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 02:36 EST, 10 March 2014 . Almost one million Britons alive today are of Viking descent, which means one in 33 men can claim to be direct descendants of the Vikings. Around 930,000 descendents of warrior race exist today - despite the Norse warriorsâ€™ British rule ending more than 900 years ago. A genetic study carried out by BritainsDNA compared the Y chromosome markers - DNA inherited from father to son - of more than 3,500 men to six DNA patterns that are rarely found outside of Scandinavia and are associated with the Norse Vikings. Scroll down for video . Amateur Vikings process around their longboat during the annual Up Helly Aa festival in Lerwick, Shetland Islands, Scotland . Records estimate that the first Viking longships landed in Britain in 793AD and that the Vikings went on to rule parts of England until the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. Vikings left behind buildings, culture and words that are still used in the English language today. Key findings from the research include that men from the Shetland (29.2 per cent) and Orkney (25.2 per cent) Islands, heavily populated by the Northmen in the Viking Age, are most likely to have Viking in their bloodlines. South of Scotland Yorkshire (5.6 per cent) and Northern England (four per cent) are the most prominent areas of the country for Norse Viking ancestry with more than 300,000 Northern men able to claim direct descent - accounting for almost a third of descendants. Thanks to the recent DNA data, around 930,000 people can claim to be of direct Viking decent . Further south the percentage of Viking descendants drops significantly, with South West England home to as few as 40,000 father line descendants. Despite being a known hotspot for the Vikings when they first landed, Ireland has very little sign of a Norse genetic contribution today, with only 1.4 per cent of men from the Emerald Isle thought to have Viking connections. Leinster has a lower count of Viking bloodlines than any other part of Britain or Ireland. Doctor Jim Wilson, chief scientist at BritainsDNA, said: 'Despite arriving well over 1,000 years ago the Viking legacy still remains strong in Britain and Ireland. 'The research suggests that the concentration of Norse blood is quite variable, but as the Y chromosome only relates to the nationâ€™s male population and only to one ancestral lineage for each man, there is a very real chance that many more of us are related to the Vikings.' Men from the far north of Scotland were most likely to provide a direct match with almost a third (29.2%) of the men from the Shetland Islands testing positive for Viking blood . Legends of the Norse warriors have become very popular since the drama series 'Vikings' began airing . Michael Hirst, creator and writer of the TV show Vikings, said: 'The research demonstrates the profound effect that the Vikings had on our country when they invaded centuries ago. 'To think that many of us may still have the blood of these feared and famed warriors flowing through our veins so long after their reign is an incredible and profound thought.' The Viking descendant population is much more prominent up in the northern parts of the British Isles .

A woman who lived and worked near Pittsburgh is among the 239 people aboard a Malaysia Airlines jet that disappeared en route to Beijing over the weekend, her employer said Monday. Mei Ling Chng, a Malaysian national, was a senior process engineer for Eastman Chemical subsidiary Flexsys America in Monongahela, near Pittsburgh, her employer confirmed. Co-workers 'are deeply shocked and saddened' a spokesperson said.

Her uncle was heard shouting Saturday in the Malaysian capital's airport, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 'Be truthful about this,' Koon Chim Wa yelled with his hands trembling and his body shaking. 'They say they don't know where the plane is, is this a joke?' Chng was flying back to the US, he told the paper. 'As you can imagine, this has been a very shocking and sad situation and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of all aboard the missing flight and in particular to those of our co-worker,' said Eastman spokesperson Tracey Kilgore. 'We are still trying to pull together details, and also, out of respect to her family, we are not in a position to release personal information about her.'

Chng made a strong impression on Valerie Shafer, the seller. 'She was a very intelligent young lady. I was quite impressed with her,' said Shafer, adding that 'I remember holding Chng up to my daughter' as an example of how education and hard work could enable a single young woman to buy a house. Shafer, who works in human resources, said she stayed in touch with Chng after the sale via email and even checked on packages that were left at the house when the woman was away. 'She was just a very accomplished young woman. I'm just devastated to hear she was on that flight.' Chng had 'a very nice smile,' she added. Little person details have been released about Chng outside of Kilgore saying she was 'remembered fondly by her co-workers as being ... pleasant and happy as well as well-respected.'

"PUBLISHED: . 12:39 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:48 EST, 7 March 2014 . Experts are warning against a risky new cocktail trend that encourages drinkers to inhale alcohol rather than swallow it. The 'Vaportini' - glass apparatus designed to heat high volume alcohol - caused uproar in the U.S. when it was launched in 2012, with doctors claiming potentially serious side effects as smoking alcohol is toxic to the lungs. Now the trend appears to be gathering pace in the UK ahead of the summer festival season leading to charities and experts warning young professionals against unsafe alcohol consumption. This image from the Vaportini Tumblr account shows young women heating and inhaling alcohol on a night out . First released in December 2012, the $40 (£28) Vaportini acts in a manner similar to a traditional vaporizer, heating and releasing intoxicating vapors which are breathed through a straw after being heated by a candle to 140 Fahreneheit. Bypassing the digestive system, the Vaportini causes alcohol to be ingested directly to the bloodstream through the lungs, potentially causing dangerous levels of intoxication - especially if abused. Inventor and bar owner Julie Palmer created the simple glass and steel contraption after a night in Helsinki inhaling vodka fumes over a coal fire. She claims that taking the alcohol directly into the bloodstream has the advantage of 'almost no calories, no carbs, no impurities and immediate effects'. The alcohol fumes are ingested via a glass straw and pass straight into the blood stream . But while the idea of a calorie-free high is appealing to diet-conscious drinkers experts and authorities here have been quick to slam the trend. The London Fire Brigade is concerned that the craze will end up costing lives. Group Manager Mark Hazelton said: 'Any product which encourages people to light candles when consuming alcohol is a concern. We don’t want to sound like killjoys, but products like the Vaportini could lead to a worrying rise in the number of people being burned and causing fires while drunk.' A spokesman told the London Evening Standard: . 'The Brigade believes that heating alcohol in this way could increase . the risk of someone having a serious fire which could destroy their home . or, even worse, kill them. 'Firefighters . are reminding people that drinking and naked flames don’t mix and that . one in four people who die in a fire has alcohol in their system. 'The . figures show that young professionals had 1,515 house fires last year . and the Brigade is concerned that this figure could rise.' Vaportini sell various kits of apparatus online, with prices starting at $40 (£24) Meanwhile Professor Jonathan Chick, advisor to alcohol education charity Drinkaware explained the process: 'Alcohol . is a volatile liquid. As temperature rises, it turns to vapour at some . 40 degree Celsius sooner than water. Thus a beverage from a bottle of . spirits, which is part alcohol and part water can be heated and the . alcohol vapour inhaled, as those in the kitchen warming Gluhwein at . Christmas will recall. 'It . enters through the lung tissue into the bloodstream. If a small measure . of a spirit, say 1 unit, was heated and inhaled it all enters the blood . stream and will still have to be metabolised by the liver in the end, . although it is true that there is less immediate 'hit' on the liver by . this method. 'However, . there is greater 'hit' on the brain, than when alcohol is taken by . mouth, because some of it has not already been broken down on its way . through the liver and this will increase the risk of damage to brain . cells. So the method cannot be called safer to the body organs. 'There . is an added risk of inhalation which is due to the direct impact on the . brain - that is, risk of unsteadiness, falling or impulsive behaviour. 'It . is possible that the vapour method may lead to some taking larger . quantities of alcohol than they would have done if they were only . ingesting by mouth through the stomach, because the stomach can limit . its emptying rate with strong concentrations of spirit, and may . sometimes cause vomiting, which is a limiting step. 'The . vapour method will be used by those who are looking for rapid . intoxication. Some unwanted effects of alcohol may also be felt more . rapidly, by the consumer and those around.' Professor Chris Day added: 'The fact that it bypasses your body’s natural defence mechanisms against consuming too much alcohol means it is unsafe. 'Inhaling alcohol is a very new trend so there isn't yet any scientific data of the effects but it has the potential to be a very dangerous phenomenon and as such, we would advise people to be cautious if indeed they do decide to try it.' The alcohol is heated using a small candle or tea light . Inventor Julie Palmer created the boozy gadget with the help of her engineer father. She says: . 'We spent several interesting afternoons testing the best temperature . for alcohol to evaporate from spirits. We also explored several ways to . achieve and sustain that optimal temperate. 'This . led to research in the heat density of many substances, diamonds have . the highest heat density, but are completely impractical. We settled on . lead, but it had to be protected from human contact, for obvious . reasons. 'I found a hollow . stainless steel base that could be filled with lead. I worked with a . local metal worker to fill them. The purchased glass vessels were . modified, creating an air intake close to the surface of the spirits, . insertion of a straw to inhale the evaporated alcohol, and insuring a . close contact of the base to the glass vessel. I heated the bases in a . small oven, filled the vessel with liquor, and placed it in the base. Within 5 minutes, the alcohol had evaporated from the spirits and was . ready to inhale.'","Makers are calling the Vaportini a 'revolution in alcohol consumption'

Hundreds of women in England are to be the first in the world to benefit from a drug for advanced cervical cancer - the most common cancer affecting young women. Trials show Avastin, which is already used in other cancers, gives women almost four months’ extra life. The drug will be available to patients via the Cancer Drugs Fund despite not yet having a licence for cervical cancer. Successful: Avastin, which is already used in other cancers, could give women almost four months of extra life . Experts at NHS England decided to add it to the list of approved medicines after requests for access from oncologists and following review of the positive trial results. Professor Peter Clark, Chair of the Chemotherapy CRG, said ‘This new addition to the list demonstrates NHS England’s commitment to achieving maximum benefit to patients from the £200 million Cancer Drugs Fund. ‘The process of updating the list is led by cancer specialists, and should ensure that patients benefit quickly when new drugs become available that are backed by good evidence from trial data.’ It is thought 500 women every year could benefit from the drug, which is routinely available on the NHS before any other country in the world. Sufferer: TV star Jade Goody died in March 2009 aged 27 after a public battle with cervical cancer . Nearly 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the UK each year, and it kills around 1,000 women. Cervical cancer, which is cancer of the neck of the womb, is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under. It is treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and if diagnosed and treated early the outlook is good. However, for patients who are diagnosed when their cancer is at a more advanced stage it becomes more difficult to treat and a cure is unlikely. Reality TV star Jade Goody died in March 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease. The time between her diagnosis and death was just months, suggesting her cancer was already at an advanced stage on diagnosis and within five months it had spread. Avastin, which is also known as bevacizumab, is widely used in patients with colon cancer and licensed for four other types of cancer. Trial findings show Avastin can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 30 per cent compared with chemotherapy. Using the drug led to overall survival of 17 months compared to 13.3 months and almost half of patients responded to treatment. Robert Music, Chief Executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said ‘The addition of bevacizumab to the Cancer Drugs Fund is very positive as for women who receive a late stage diagnosis of cervical cancer, the prognosis can often be poor. Disease: Experts at NHS England decided to add Avastin to the list of approved medicines after requests for access from oncologists and following review of the positive trial results. Above, cells showing cervical cancer . ‘When this is the case, any extra time that can be provided through new drugs becomes extremely valuable. We hope this will result in extended survival without impacting on quality of life for those facing non-curative treatment.’ The Cancer Drugs Fund provides an additional £200m each year to enable patients with cancer in England to access drugs that are not routinely funded by their local NHS. The national Cancer Drugs Fund list is a single national list of approved fast-track drugs giving uniform access to treatment across the country. From 1 April, NHS England took on responsibility for the operational management of the Cancer Drugs Fund. A spokesman for Roche, which makes Avastin, said NHS England had made the life extending treatment routinely available on the NHS before any other country in the world. ‘Roche remains committed to are working with regulatory authorities to seek a licence for Avastin in advanced cervical cancer’ she added.","Avastin gives sufferers almost four months' extra life, according to trials .

Arrested: Sex-offender Jaafcob Vanwinkle, 31, is facing murder charges after a female friend was found dead in her home with her two young children . Police were responding to a report of a sexual assault from the 15-year-old girl when they found the bodies. Byerly said the girl had been raped. She escaped and ran to a neighbor's home to notify police. 'This is a very, very tragic event. It's a very, very horrific crime,' said police Chief Paul Schultz. The girl was taken to a hospital, where she was treated and released. None of the victims has been identified. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation has been called in to help with the crime scene. The three victims have not yet been identified as police work to notify their next of kin. Criminal record: A mugshot from Jaacob Vanwinkle's 2011 arrest in Indiana . This isn't the first time Vanwinkle has been tied to a suspicious death. In September 2011, Vanwinkle was arrested by police in Johnson County, Indiana when his 50-year-old roommate Michael Eaton was found dead at the residence their shared together, the Denver Westword revealed. Police found Eaton's body buried debris in a bedroom at the shared residence, and arrested Vanwinkle soon after hiding out in the woods. At the time, Vanwinkle told authorities that he didn't kill his roommate but did admit to moving the body and covering it with clothes and blankets. Vanwinkle surrendered peacefully to police when they found him in the woods. He was also wanted on a parole violation. It's uncertain whether Vanwinkle ever served time in the Eaton case, but public records show that he was in prison as recently as 2012. His most recent release day was May 30, 2012. Vanwinkle somehow made it out to Colorado where he is listed in the state sex offender registry. Public records show he was convicted of child molestation in 2004, and theft in 2010.","Registered sex offender Jaacob Vanwinkle, 31, was arrested after the bodies of a family friend and her two young children were found Sunday .

I love them all. My family has bathed me, nursed me, supported me. There is nothing they haven’t done for me. My wife is unbelievable,’ he said. ‘Oheka is alive and well. There hasn’t been a blip. Although I haven’t been around, everything seems perfect.’ Video: Watch Gary Melius talk about getting shot . Shot: Multi-millionaire Gary Melius was shot in front of Oheka Castle in New York's Long Island . He also praised the doctors and nurses who have cared for him while he was in hospital as well as the police investigating the case, adding that he was on the road to a complete recovery. 'I would say that I am a very fortunate man. I’m healing, getting better [and] looking forward to just starting over again,' he said. Melius was released from the hospital last week. He has vowed to help cops hunt down the masked gunman – but said nothing during the video about suspects or a possible motive. Moments before Melius was shot on Feb 25, two cars without license plates were seen pulling into the parking lot of his lavish estate. A black sedan was seen on surveillance footage appearing to act as a lookout while a gunman in a Jeep Cherokee fired shots at 69-year-old Melius. The hotelier was shot through the eye while he sat in his Mercedes in an apparent assassination attempt around 12.30pm.

Last year, Melius was part of a controversy that resulted in the ousting of then-Nassau County Police Commissioner Thomas Dale over the arrest of a witness in an election lawsuit. The district attorney found that Dale had instructed officers to arrest a 29-year-old Roosevelt man, who had testified in an unrelated case that he had been paid to collect signatures for a third-party candidate. Melius, a supporter of the third-party candidate, then contacted Dale seeking to have the young man investigated. The young man was arrested on an outstanding warrant while riding a county bus on October 5. An investigation by the Nassau County district attorney found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing but raised questions about the ethics of Dale's actions, leading to his resignation. His close friend, former U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato was waiting to meet Melius for a meal at a local steakhouse when he was informed of his friends shooting. 'It was not a robbery,' Mr D'Amato said after leaving Melius' bedside according to Newsday. 'It was an attempt at assassination. He was at the Castle, outside. Nobody put a gun to him or said, 'We want your money.' They just shot him. The guy had a mask on.'

Love your tablet computer, but sometimes wish you just could roll it up like a newspaper and stick it away in your pocket? Soon exactly this will be possible, thanks to a breakthrough in the  technology which allows electronic gadgets to be folded up or bent. Until now, these intricate computer components – thin plastic sheets of electronic circuits, similar to sheets of paper – were only available in very small quantities in laboratories and limited to certain types of devices. The new technology of more lightweight and flexible circuitry could mean a much more unique technology, like a flexible tablet computer that can be rolled up or folded . But researchers at the University of Surrey are working with Philips to develop their ‘source-gated-transistor’ (SGT), a simple circuit which is likely to become much easier to manufacture for ‘smart’ gadgets. It means flexible tablets could be widely available in the near future, the journal Scientific Reports said. Previously studies found that the technology could be applied to lots of different electronic designs, as long as they had an analogue basis, but through the most recent study has found that SGT technology can be applied to next-generation digital circuits. Circuitry has previously been incredibly complicated, not to mention regimented by the technology available, and new technology might mean easier production of next generation tech . SGTs control the electric current as it enters a semiconductor, which decreases the odds of circuit malfunction, improves energy efficiency and keeps fabrication costs to a minimum. These properties make SGTs ideal for next-gen electronic devices, and could enable digital technologies to be incorporated into those built using flexible plastics or clothing textiles. Other technologies might include ultra-lightweight and flexible gadgets which can be rolled up to save space when not in use, smart plasters, thinner than a human hair, that can wirelessly monitor the health of the wearer, low-cost electronic shopping tags for instant checkout, and disaster prediction sensors, used on buildings in regions that are at high risk of natural disasters. Lead researcher Doctor Radu Sporea, of the Advanced Technology Institute (ATI) at the University of Surrey, said: 'These technologies involve thin plastic sheets of electronic circuits, similar to sheets of paper, but embedded with smart technologies. 'Until now, such technologies could only be produced reliably in small quantities, and that confined them to the research lab. 'However, with SGTs we have shown we can achieve characteristics needed to make these technologies viable, without increasing the complexity or cost of the design.' Professor Ravi Silva, Director of the ATI and a co-author of the study, said: 'This work is a classic example of academia working closely with industry for over two decades to perfect a concept which has wide-reaching applications across a variety of technologies. 'Whilst SGTs can be applied to mainstream materials such as silicon, used widely in the production of current consumer devices, it is the potential to apply them to new materials such graphene that makes this research so crucial.' 'By making these incredible devices less complex and implicitly very affordable, we could see the next generation of gadgets become mainstream much quicker than we thought.'","New 'Source Gated Transistor' is much easier to produce for smart gadgets .

As a result, we find it easier to remember things we see or touch than those we hear. The researchers recommend that we write down things we want to remember – and supplement the words with pictures. Scientists at the University of Iowa found that teachers should use more visual aids if they want pupils to remember what they are telling them as we find it easier to remember things we see, rather than hear . To make the finding, US scientists asked a group of students to listen to pairs of beeps and say if the two were identical. The time lag between the beeps in each pair was gradually increased and the accuracy of their answers noted. Visual memory was measured by doing the task with pictures and to test memory for touch, the students repeatedly a gripped a bar that vibrated at different rates. In the very short-term, all three types of memory were equally good. But within just four to eight seconds, the students clearly found it harder to remember the beeps than the pictures or vibrations. The finding could help explain why it is so hard to remember a phone number if you don’t write it down. The finding could help explain why it is so hard to remember a phone number if you don¿t write it down . Researcher Amy Poremba, of the University of Iowa, said: ‘If someone gives you a number, and you dial it right away, you are usually fine. But do anything in between, and the odds are you will have forgotten it.’ Dr Poremba then did a second experiment using scenarios more akin to everyday life. Students listened to recordings of dogs barking, watched silent videos of a basketball game, and picked up coffee mugs and other common objects hidden from view. The students remembered the videos and mugs and objects equally well. However, they  recordings were more of a struggle. Writing in the journal PLOS ONE, Dr Poremba said the results suggest that the way the mind processes and stores sound may be different from the way it process and stores other types of memories. She said: ‘We tend to think that the parts of our brain wired for memory are integrated. ‘But our findings indicate our brain may use separate pathways to process information. ‘Even more, our study suggests the brain may process auditory information differently than visual and tactile information, and alternative strategies - such as increased mental repetition - may be needed when trying to improve memory. ‘As teachers, we want to assume students will remember everything we say. But if you really want something to be memorable you may need to include a visual or hands-on experience, in addition to auditory information.’ With previous work showing that monkeys and chimps also find it harder to recall things they have heard, it is thought the weakness has its roots in the evolution of the primate brain.","Scientists at the University of Iowa say we should write down things we want to remember and supplement the words with pictures .

Hundreds of NHS websites have huge security flaws that could see them taken over or defaced by hackers. During investigations, more than 2,000 vulnerabilities have been found, with experts warning criminals could use these flaws to easily infect people’s computers and steal their personal information. There are said to be around 5,000 NHS domains - covering everything from GPs' surgeries to sites that help people give up smoking or offer advice on breastfeeding. However, because there’s no central body responsible for the security and maintenance of these sites, many are abandoned, making them easy prey for hackers. Read the full story in Computer Active magazine, out now . More than 2,000 vulnerabilities have been found during a Computer Active investigation into NHS websites. There are around 5,000 NHS domains, but because there's no central body responsible for the security and maintenance of these sites, many are abandoned making them easy prey for hackers . The majority of these flaws are caused by outdated versions of WordPress. Around 400 ‘.nhs.uk’ websites run WordPress - a popular website-building tool - but fewer than 50 of these use the latest, most secure version. Five NHS websites run a version of WordPress that was last updated in 2008. The investigation was carried out by a security researcher and Computer Active magazine, pictured, on sale now . Outdated versions of WordPress are constantly targeted by hackers. In September 2013, security experts estimated 70 per cent of all websites running WordPress were vulnerable. In addition to old versions of WordPress, many of the NHS sites run outdated plug-ins. The vast majority of these websites also use unsecured administrator login pages. This means that when a website . administrator logs in, their username and password are sent without . encryption, making them vulnerable to interception by a hacker, who . could gain complete control of the site. Terence Eden, an independent . security researcher uncovered the flaws and has informed the NHS. He likened the situation to someone 'walking past a house and seeing a wide . open window. 'An attacker . could use the site to host viruses - or automatically redirect users to . convincing-looking fake sites. An attacker could also change the site to . look like the NHS is endorsing and selling dodgy pills and potions,' Eden explained. Eden said that bugs on old versions of . WordPress could also let criminals steal passwords and other personal . information, which in turn could compromise the integrity of the NHS. 'If . people are not able to trust the information present on their local . hospital’s website, they are less likely to trust the NHS.' Is visiting NHS sites going to infect my computer? Any website could be compromised by hackers, but poorly coded websites running outdated and vulnerable code are easy targets. At . the moment hackers aren’t targeting these NHS websites - but the . security flaws uncovered show that they would be alarmingly easy to . attack. Is it dangerous for me to visit any WordPress site?Absolutely . not. In the same way you’d keep software on your PC updated, a . website’s security also needs to be kept up to scratch to protect it . against attack. WordPress is a popular tool for building attractive and . easy-to- use websites, with nearly 76 million sites using it. Why are old versions of WordPress so vulnerable?Just . as you keep software on your computer up to date, websites also need . regular updates to keep them safe. This is where some NHS websites have . failed. Of the 5,000 or so websites using the ‘.nhs.uk’ domain about 400 . of them run WordPress. What’s worrying is that fewer than 50 are . running the latest version, WordPress 3.8.1. Even more alarmingly, some . sites – such as a stop smoking advice website for Somerset NHS – are . running versions of WordPress that were released in August 2008. You . wouldn’t run a computer that was last updated five years ago - the same . applies to websites. What is ‘cross-site scripting’ and why is it dangerous?Also . known as XSS, cross-site scripting allows a hacker to exploit the ‘user . input’ part of a website, such as a search box, to run malicious code. This vulnerability means anyone with the right know-how can make images, . links, text or video appear on a website. By doing this a hacker could . add anything they wanted to an NHS website. Most websites block this . code from running, but poorly designed websites don’t. One . NHS website, which offers advice on breastfeeding, contains a . cross-site scripting vulnerability that lets anyone add their own . images, videos, text and links to pages. To . demonstrate this, Eden added a video of a bear fishing for . salmon to this NHS webpage. In the hands of a criminal this could easily . be a pornographic video or link to a malicious website that steals your . personal information and infects your computer. Since Eden hacked this site, Liverpool city council’s Public Health department, which has responsibility for it, has fixed the issue and said it is 'satisfied the site is now secure.' In another example, Eden showed that a website about improving the quality of NHS leadership and patient care could easily be altered to contain links to websites selling fake sexual aids. The majority of the flaws are caused by outdated versions of WordPress. Around 400 '.nhs.uk' websites run WordPress but fewer than 50 of these use the latest, most secure version. Five NHS websites, including this stop smoking service from Somerset NHS, run a version of WordPress last updated in 2008 . The Health and Social Care Information . Centre (HSCIC), which processes applications for ‘.nhs.uk’ domain . names, said that responsibility for upkeep lay 'with the organisation . running each website or service.' After being made aware of the security . flaws HSCIC said it was 'drafting some additional guidance' that will . be issued to anyone using an NHS domain. Despite this, nearly all the flaws highlighted are still present and exploitable. In . most cases, GP surgeries and local NHS bodies outsource the development . of their websites to specialist private companies, with many seemingly . never updated. Bill Douglas, head of Applications at the Cheshire and Merseyside Commissioning Support Unit, explained that while the main NHS Choices website is maintained by a central IT team, local websites merely had to follow 'some general guidelines.' To demonstrate the flaw, security researcher Terence Eden added a video of a bear fishing for salmon to an NHS webpage, pictured. Liverpool city council's Public Health department has now fixed the issue on this site and said it is 'satisfied the site is secure' One software company, responsible for . the development of 'many hundreds' of NHS websites for GP surgeries, added that once a website had been developed it was the surgery’s . responsibility to keep it updated. Computer Active also found a number of security flaws in many of the company’s NHS . websites that left them vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack via . HTML injection. This can make it easy for hackers to change how a site . looks by adding their own images, videos, text and links. This flaw has . now been fixed. Simon Edwards, head of Dennis Technology Labs said that because people are more likely to trust NHS websites, they were a very attractive target for criminals. 'The old advice about avoiding pornographic websites, cracked software and other dubious parts of the internet still holds, but threats are not limited to these places,' he warned. 'When we test security software it’s common to find that the malicious software is stored and downloaded from innocent websites that have been hacked.'","Security researchers found more than 2,000 vulnerabilities in NHS websites .

Many people are partial to a helping of healthy sushi and now researchers have revealed another reason to indulge in the fishy favourite. U.S. scientists have found that the omega-3 fatty acids in fish can reduce hardening of the arteries. People who have high levels of coronary artery calcification - which causes the hardening - are more likely to develop heart disease. Eating sushi could reduce your risk of heart disease because the omega-3 fatty acids in fish prevent coronary artery calcification. Coronary artery calcification is a predictor of heart disease . Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found that middle-aged men who live in Japan have less coronary artery calcification than middle-aged white men living in the U.S. They believe this could be because Japanese men consume significantly more fish. ‘Multiple studies have looked at the effect of fish oil on cardiovascular health, with mixed results,’ said lead author Akira Sekikawa, an associate professor of epidemiology. ‘Previous studies investigated substantially lower intake of omega-3 fatty acids than what people in Japan actually get through their diet. 'Our study seems to indicate that the level of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids consumed must be higher than previously thought to impart substantial protection.’ Marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, especially oily fish and in squid and krill, may help to reduce inflammation and slow the formation of fatty plaques in arteries, he added. The researchers worked with colleagues in Japan, Hawaii and Philadelphia to follow almost 300 men for five years. Japanese men who eat a lot of sushi have three times less coronary artery calcification than American men who do not eat much fish . These men had their smoking habits, cholesterol levels, alcohol consumption and blood pressure recorded. After accounting for risk factors for heart disease, the U.S. men were found to have three times the incidence of coronary artery calcification than the Japanese men. Meanwhile, the levels of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acid in the blood were more than 100 per cent higher in the Japanese men than in the white men. ‘The vast difference in heart disease and levels of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acid are not due to genetic factors,’ said Dr Sekikawa. ‘When we look at Japanese Americans, we find that their levels of coronary artery calcification are actually higher than that of the rest of the U.S. population.’ The average dietary intake of fish by Japanese people living in Japan is nearly 100 grams each day, which the American Heart Association considers to be 1.5 servings. The average American eats about seven to 13 grams of fish a day, or about one serving a week. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and globally, according to the World Health Organization. However, Japan bucks this trend, with cancer as the leading cause of death. Dr Sekikawa added: ‘I am not encouraging Americans to start consuming massive amounts of fish, which may have harmful contaminants, such as mercury, in their flesh. ‘However, our findings indicate that it is worthwhile to take another look at the effect of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids on heart disease, particularly when consumed at higher rates than previously investigated.’ The news comes just days after an Uppsala University study revealed that people who eat a lot of fish are less likely to develop a 'muffin top'. The Swedish researchers found that eating polyunsaturated fat - such as that found in salmon - gain more muscle and less fat than those who eat a lot of saturated fat. They found these people also store less fat around their waists and their internal organs.","The omega-3 fatty acids in fish can reduce coronary artery calcification .

The ancestors of Native Americans may have set up home in a region between Siberia and Alaska which contained woody plants that they could use to make fires, according to a new study . It was a mystery how the ancestors of Native Americans survived the Ice Age. But now a team of international scientists think they might have solved the mystery and it has to do with the ancient people living in a wooded tundra area after splitting from their Asian relatives 25,000 years ago. The ancestors of Native Americans probably set up home in a region between Siberia and Alaska, which contained woody plants that they could use to make fires, according to a new study. A group of academics at Royal Holloway, University of London, and the universities of Colorado and Utah analysed fossils to come to this conclusion. Until now no-one had any idea about where the ancestors of Native Americans spent around 10,000 years before they arrived in Alaska and the rest of North America. Professor Scott Elias, from the Department of Geography at Royal Holloway said: ‘This work fills in a 10,000-year missing link in the story of the peopling of the New World.’ The experts think that the group of people must have lived on the Bering land Bridge, which is now under the waters of the Bering and Chukchi Seas. The land bridge and some adjacent regions were not as dry as the rest of Beringia - the region surrounding the Bering Strait, including parts of Russia and Alaska – and the central part where the Native Americans are now thought to have lived, was covered in shrub tundra, which is the most common vegetation in modern Arctic Alaska. The landscape is dominated by dwarf willow and birch shrubs, mosses and lichens. Professor Elias said: ‘We believe that . these ancestors survived on the shrub tundra of the Bering Land Bridge . because this was the only region of the Arctic where any woody plants . were growing.’ This map shows the outlines of modern Siberia (left) and Alaska (right) with dashed lines. The broader area in darker green (now covered by ocean) represents the Bering land bridge near the end of the last glacial maximum, a period that lasted from 28,000 to 18,000 years ago when sea levels were low and ice sheets extended south into what is now the northern part of the lower 48 states. University of Utah anthropologist Dennis O¿Rourke argues in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Science that the ancestors of Native Americans migrated from Asia onto the Bering land bridge or ¿Beringia¿ some 25,000 years ago and spent 10,000 years there until they began moving into the Americas 15,000 years ago as the ice sheets melted. The theory, now known as the 'Beringia Standstill,' was first proposed in 1997 by two Latin American geneticists and refined in 2007 by a team led by the University of Tartu in Estonia that sampled mitrochondrial DNA from more than 600 Native Americans. The researchers found that mutations in the DNA indicated a group of their direct ancestors from Siberia was likely isolated for at least several thousand years in the region of the Bering Land Bridge, the now-submerged plain that lies between northeast Asia and Alaska once exposed by a significantly lower sea level. ‘They needed the wood for fuel to make camp fires in this bitterly cold region of the world. They would have used dwarf shrub wood to get a small fire going, then placed large mammal bones on top of the fire, to ignite the fats inside the bones. ‘Once burning, large leg bones of ice-age mammals would have burned for hours, keeping people alive through Arctic winter nights.’ The academics analysed insect and plant fossils extracted from sediment cores taken from the ancient land bridge, to make the discovery. It now lies on the sea floor between 50 and 60 metres below the water’s surface. Work by Elias and others included the analysis of certain beetle species that live in very specific temperature zones, allowing them to be used as tiny thermometers. The insects indicated that temperatures there were relatively mild during last glacial maximum that ran from about 27,000 years to 20,000 years ago, only slightly cooler than temperatures in the region today. The central part of Beringia where the Native Americans are now thought to have lived, was covered in shrub tundra, which is the most common vegetation in modern Arctic Alaska (pictured). The landscape is dominated by dwarf willow and birch shrubs, mosses and lichens. 'The climate on the land bridge and adjacent parts of Siberia and Alaska was a bit wetter than the interior regions like central Alaska and the Yukon, but not a lot warmer,' said Elias. 'Our data show that woody shrubs were available on the land bridge, which would have facilitated the making of fires by the people there.' The theory, now known as the 'Beringia Standstill,' was first proposed in 1997 by two Latin American geneticists and refined in 2007 by a team led by the University of Tartu in Estonia that sampled mitrochondrial DNA from more than 600 Native Americans. The researchers found that mutations in the DNA indicated a group of their direct ancestors from Siberia was likely isolated for at least several thousand years in the region of the Bering Land Bridge, the now-submerged plain that lies between northeast Asia and Alaska once exposed by a significantly lower sea level. The people we know as Native Americans arrived at the continent in three separate great migrations. Most Native Americans are descended from a small group of migrants that crossed a 'land bridge' between Asia and America during the ice ages 15,000 years ago. These migrants, known as the 'First Americans', populated most of North and South America. All the groups originally came from Siberia, Beringia - a land bridge between Asia and America that existed during the ice ages, more than 15,000 years ago. By studying variations in Native American DNA sequences, a team of scientists found in 2012 that while most of the Native American populations arose from the first migration, two subsequent migrations also made important genetic contributions. The second and third migrations have left an impact only in Arctic populations that speak Eskimo-Aleut languages and in the Canadian Chipewyan who speak a Na-Dene language. Eskimos show the most differences, with just 50 per cent of their DNA coming from the 'First Americans'.","Experts at Royal Holloway, University of London and the universities of Colorado and Utah said people must have lived on the Bering land Bridge .

A mother suffered an extreme and terrifying form of postnatal depression which caused her to hear voices and fantasise about killing her baby daughter. Having never suffered any form of mental illness, Lyndsey Walker, 20, experienced rare postpartum psychosis following the birth of her daughter Elizabeth, now 15 months old. The psychosis manifested itself as a male voice inside Miss Walker's head which told her she was an unfit mother and that her family would be better off if she were dead. Recovered: Lyndsey Walker, 20, with fiance Andrew, experienced rare postpartum psychosis following the birth of her daughter Elizabeth, now 15 months old . Troubled: The psychosis manifested itself as a male voice inside Miss Walker's head which told her she was an unfit mother and her family would be better off if she were dead . The voice even encouraged her to imagine asphyxiating Elizabeth, resulting in Miss Walker attempting suicide. While postnatal depression is relatively common, affecting around one in ten women, postpartum psychosis is 100 times rarer. Miss Walker, a former hairdresser, said: 'After Elizabeth was born I didn't feel anything towards her, good or bad. I had no emotions at all. 'I pretended I was delighted in order not to make other people alarmed. But I was steadily getting worse, and soon resented having to change and feed Elizabeth. 'A deep male voice started talking to me, coming to me at times I couldn't predict. He told me I was so bad at being a mum that Elizabeth would be better off if I were dead. 'I had visions of smothering Elizabeth with a pillow, which I believed would make the voice leave me alone, although I never came close to hurting her.' Arrival: Baby Elizabeth was born in December 2012 after an exhausting 39 hour labour . Miss Walker said: 'I loved having the bump. I felt really close to my daughter from an early stage. The labour really took it out of me. But when they gave me Elizabeth to hold, I didn't feel anything . Elizabeth, Miss Walker's daughter with her fiance Andrew Jackson, 29, a car detailer, was born in December 2012 after an exhausting 39-hour labour. Miss Walker, of Preston, said: 'Andrew and I found out I was pregnant almost as soon as we decided to start trying. We were really happy. Postpartum psychosis affects about 1 in every 1,000 women (0.1 per cent) who have a baby. It is much less common than Baby Blues or postnatal depression. It is a severe episode of mental illness which begins suddenly in the days or weeks after having a baby. Symptoms vary and can change rapidly. They can include high mood (mania), depression, confusion, hallucinations and delusions. Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency and help must be sought as quickly as possible. Postpartum psychosis can happen to any woman. It often occurs ‘out of the blue’ to women who have not been ill before. Women usually recover fully after an episode of postpartum psychosis. (SOURCE: Royal College of Psychiatrists) 'I'm close to my mum and loved the idea of passing on that love and having a little life to care for. 'I loved having the bump. I felt really close to my daughter from an early stage. The labour really took it out of me. Then, when they gave me Elizabeth to hold, I didn't feel anything. I wasn't sad, or surprised. I didn't feel any strong feelings whatsoever. I thought, 'I'm holding a baby, and it's OK, but I'm not that bothered'. 'Over time, things became unbearable. Washing, dressing and feeding Elizabeth was just a chore. Andy and my mum Amanda could tell I was suffering so they asked me to go and see a doctor.' At the GP's office, Miss Walker was scared to reveal a troubling development - that she had begun hearing a voice in her head. She said: 'I wasn't sleeping very much and was very shaky. I was terrified that if the doctor heard about the voice then Elizabeth would be taken away from me. 'The voice told me that Elizabeth was sent by the devil. Then, when I began fantasise about hurting her, I knew it was time to seek help. Problems: As time went on, Miss Walker struggled to  wash, dress and feed Elizabeth, because it felt like 'a chore' 'I told mum everything and she took me back to the doctor, who diagnosed postpartum psychosis and prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medicine. But by then I was doing everything to voice told me to do. 'It tried to make a bargain - it said it would leave me alone if I swallowed all my medication at the same time while drinking an entire bottle of wine.' Recovering from her overdose, Miss Walker volunteered to be placed on a psychiatric ward, where she would stay under close supervision for two weeks. She said: 'It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It was strange having to line up for medication every morning with the other patients, and being away from everyone. 'Although I was allowed visitors, I wasn't permitted to see Elizabeth for a week. Battle: Miss Walker began to hear a voice in her head that said Elizabeth was sent by the devil. When she began fantasise about hurting her, she knew she had to seek help . Apart: Miss Walker was banned from seeing Elizabeth for a week - during which time she began to long for her . 'Being away from her had an effect I didn't expect - I started longing to be with her. It was the first sign of a change within me. 'When I came out of hospital I started to notice things about Elizabeth - how beautiful her smile was, and what fun we had when we're together. Miss Walker hopes to raise awareness of postpartum psychosis to help others affected . 'I knew I loved her and would do anything for her.' Today Miss Walker says Elizabeth is the light of her life. She has been given a clean bill of health by psychiatrists and doctors and, following several months of aftercare at home, she will be completely discharged from the mental healthcare services next week. She now hopes to raise awareness of postpartum psychosis in order to give hope to parents affected by it. Postpartum psychosis, or PPP, affects approximately one in 1,000 mothers. Most women who experience it have no history of mental illness themselves, or within their families. She said: 'I've had to accept that the experience has changed my life. 'Women who have suffered postpartum psychosis after their first pregnancy have an even chance of developing it again after following pregnancies, so there are risk factors to consider if I want to have more children in the future. 'What I went through was terrible and even though it's rare it can happen to anyone. 'But when people ask me about it, I don't shy away from it. It's important that all aspects of mental health are discussed openly and honestly in order for people to understand it better.'

Britain’s recent  spell of wet weather has damaged many people’s homes but it has also unearthed some archaeological treasures. Prints that could be 7,000 years old have been uncovered by a tidal surge in Northumberland. The impressions, some made by animals and others possibly by humans, have been preserved in a newly exposed area of peat bed at Druridge Bay. The footprints, some made by animals (pictured) and others possibly by humans, have been preserved in a newly exposed area of peat bed at Druridge Bay, Northumberland . It has not yet been revealed which animals made each of the prints discovered. However, a similar site nearby, where prints were confirmed to be 7,000 years old, contained comparable prints. They were found to have been made by wild boar, . large deer and cattle, which are thought to have been similar to the modern . Highland variety. Adult and child footprints were also . identified at the Low Hauxley site. It is believed the 100metre long bed has been uncovered during the recent tidal surge that hit the east coast of England. The find follows the discovery of similar footprints, which have since dated at more than 7,000 years old, at nearby Low Hauxley in an organised dig that took place last year. Archaeologist Barry Mead found the latest prints on his daily walk along the beach near his home with his dog, although it is not yet certain as to exactly which animals the prints were made by. Mr Mead, who is Greater Morpeth Development Trust’s Heritage Officer, was involved in last year’s dig and now regularly walks the length of Druridge Bay to look for new prints. At around the time the prints (pictured) were thought to be made, Mesolithic period hunter-gatherers who had followed migrating animals as they moved around the country, were beginning to form settled communities . The new animal prints were found at Druridge Bay (pictured) and similar were discovered at Low Hauxley (also pictured) last year, which included footprints made by adults and a child 7,000 years ago . ‘I have never seen this peat bed until now. When I looked more closely you can clearly see lots of footprints along with some large tree trunks, one of which is still attached to its root system,’ he said. ‘My discovery of these latest footprints adds to the picture that has been built up of what life may have been like thousands of years ago on this stretch of the Northumberland coast. ‘Around the time these prints would have been made, Mesolithic period hunter-gatherers who had followed migrating animals as they moved around the country, were beginning to form settled communities.’ Archaeologist Barry Mead found the latest prints (pictured) on his daily walk along the beach near his Cresswell home with his dog . Archaeologist Barry Mead (pictured) said: 'My discovery of these latest footprints adds to the picture that has been built up of what life may have been like thousands of years ago on this stretch of the Northumberland coast' Both adult and child prints were identified during the Low Hauxley dig as well as those of wild boar, large deer and cattle, which are thought to be similar to the modern Highland variety. Radiocarbon dating confirmed that the prints were more than 7,000 years old. Mr Mead said: ‘It is reasonable to assume that the footprints I discovered may have been made by these same animals - and perhaps humans - around the same time because of their proximity to Low Hauxley. It is quite incredible to stand on the beach and look at footprints that may have been left by animals passing this very way perhaps thousands of years ago.’ The earliest footprints left by humans outside Africa have been found in estuary mud in Norfolk, it was announced last month. Described as 'the most important discovery on British shores', the 800,000-year-old footprints were found in Happisburgh after being exposed by sea tides. Scientists believe the footprints are evidence of the earliest known humans in northern Europe, previously only revealed through the discovery of animal bones and stone tools. The footprint surface was exposed at low tide as heavy seas removed the beach sands to reveal a series of elongated hollows cut into compacted silts. Of the 50 footprints found, only around twelve were reasonably complete while two showed the toes in detail. It is thought that the prints represent a group of at least one or two adult males, at least two adult females or teenagers and three or four children. In some cases the heel, arch and even toes could be identified, equating to modern shoes of up to UK size 8. The early humans would have looked very much like us, but with much smaller brains, said one expert. Last month it was announced that 800,000-year-old footprints were found in Norfolk. Analysis from the British Museum showed the prints, pictured, were from a range of adult and juvenile foot sizes and that in some cases the heel, arch and even toes could be identified, equating to modern shoes of up to UK size 8.

US researchers found a protein called SIRT1 extended the lifespan of mice, delaying the onset of age related health problems. It also improved their general health, lowering cholesterol and even warding off diabetes. Researchers hope the study could one day slow the aging process in the elderly . Although the study was carried out in mice, researchers say it could eventually be used in humans. Researchers led by Dr. Rafael de Cabo of the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health tested the effects of a small molecule that activates SIRT1, called SIRT1720, on the health and lifespan of mice. 'Here, we show for the first time that a synthetic SIRT1 activator extends lifespan and improves healthspan of mice fed a standard diet,' says Dr. de Cabo. 'It illustrates that we can develop molecules that ameliorate the burden of metabolic and chronic diseases associated with aging.' The researchers also found that SRT1720 significantly extended the average lifespan of mice by 8.8 percent. Supplementation also reduced body weight and body fat percentage, and it improved muscle function and motor coordination throughout the animalsâ€™ lives. The supplement extended the average lifespan of mice by 8.8% . The investigators found that SRT1720 supplementation led to decreases in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels, which might help protect against heart disease, and improvements in insulin sensitivity, which could help prevent diabetes. SIRT1 and its sister protein SIRT2 are known to play a important roles in metabolism across a wide range of species. They are involved in DNA repair and gene regulation, and may help to prevent diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The animals were given the supplement from the age of six months and for the rest of their lives, alongside a standard diet. However, experts warn the study is still at a very early stage, and had not yet been tested in humans.","SIRT1 protein delays onset of aging and improved general health .

Britons should celebrate the next increase in interest rates, according to Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean . Britons should celebrate the next increase in interest rates, according to Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean. He said that such a move would signal that the economy is heading towards recovery. However he admitted the prospect was very low for the next few years and, when it does happen, the Bank would keep the base rate ‘materially below its pre-crisis average of five per cent for some while’, probably rising only to around two to three per cent. It has been five years since the central bank halved the base rate to 0.5 per cent, the lowest level in its 320-year history in a huge boost for homeowners with a mortgage. Speaking in Darlington yesterday, Mr Bean said: ‘When the time does come for us to start raising bank rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality.’ His comments echo similar ones made by the Chancellor recently who said the first increase in interest rates should be heralded as ‘a mark of success’. But homeowners, who are struggling to afford their mortgage even at today’s rock-bottom rates of interest, may struggle to agree that a rate rise will provide a reason to celebrate. There are particular worries about around one million first-time buyers who have bought over the last five years and have never experienced an increase rate rise. A recent report, based on research by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, predicts the base rate will rise three times to 1.25 per cent by December 2015. For a family with the average monthly mortgage bill of £666, this would trigger a £21 a month rise to £687 a month, equal to an extra £252 a year increase in their mortgage. Mr Bean said the first increase could take place in the spring, but urged people not to get ‘too hung up about the precise date’. In the Bank¿s latest inflation report, it said the market expects the Bank to keep the base rate 'in the range of two to three per cent for some while beyond the forecast horizon' More importantly, he said the increases will be done ‘only gradually’ and that there is absolutely no chance of rates returning to their pre-crisis average of five per cent imminently. Mr Bean, 60, who retires in June, said: ‘What, I think, is more useful for businesses to hang on to is our expectation that when bank rate does rise, it will probably do so only gradually. ‘[It will rise] to a level that is likely to remain materially below its pre-crisis average of five per cent for some while. ‘I have something like a two to three per cent range in mind here.’ It is widely expected that the base rate will remain around this level of two to three per cent until 2020. By comparison, it was typically five per cent during the ten years leading up to the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007. In the Bank’s latest inflation report, it said the market expects the Bank to keep the base rate ‘in the range of two to three per cent for some while beyond the forecast horizon.’ The so-called forecast horizon ends in 2017, and ‘for some while beyond’ is taken to mean another two to three years after this date.","It has been five years since central bank halved base rate to 0.5 per cent .

Sharmila Mistry, 42, was accused of causing the deaths of two toddlers when she was distracted by a mobile phone call. She has been found not guilty of causing death by dangerous driving . A mother-of-two who crashed into a car before ploughing into pushchairs carrying two toddlers as she chatted on her mobile phone has been found not guilty of causing death by careless driving. One-year-old Oliwier Baczyk and two-year-old Zofia Tabaka died after being struck by a BMW being driven by Sharmila Mistry, 42, in August 2012. A court heard Mistry collided with a red Mini which sent her vehicle into the Polish toddlers who were being pushed along by their fathers near a pedestrian crossing. The children were rushed to hospital with multiple injuries but Oliwier died hours later while Zofia passed away during the night. Zofia's father Lukasz Tabaka, 30, and Oliwier's mother's cousin Kamil Kohar, who were with the toddlers, both sustained minor injuries. Mistry, from Bushby, Leicestershire, went on trial at Leicester Crown Court last week accused of two counts of causing death by careless driving. And today a jury found her not guilty of the charges after three hours and 18 minutes of deliberation. Oliwier's mother wept uncontrollably in the public as the verdict was returned. Instead Mistry was found guilty of two counts of careless driving and banned from the roads for 18 months, as well as ordered to pay a £3,000 fine. During the trial, the court heard the mother-of-two was involved in a collision with the Mini being driven by Christopher Andrews, 61, who has since died of natural causes, while she was on her way to a business meeting. Jurors were told Mistry had been talking on her phone's hands-free kit as she travelled at 36mph on the 30mph road in Leicester at 9.50am on August 6, 2012. Prosecutor James Thomas said Mr Andrews drove his Mini through a red light at the busy junction while accounts manager Mistry drove through an amber light. He told the jury the impact of the crash sent her car careering across the road before it mounted the kerb, hit a set of traffic lights before smashing into the children's pushchairs. Nicholas Syfret QC, defending, had told Mistry’s trial the ‘true cause of the tragic accident’ was the Mini driver, who passed away in unrelated circumstances in the weeks following the incident. Killed: Oliwier Baczyck, 21 months, and Zofia Tabaka, two, were fatally injured after the accident in Leicester . After Mistry was acquitted of causing the deaths of the children, he said: 'In my submission, she cannot be held in any way responsible for the collision. That was the fault of the mini. That would have come as a bolt from the blue for anybody.' Giving evidence during the trial, Mistry, an accounts manager, described the moment her car struck the Mini and careered towards the two toddlers. She said: 'As soon as I felt impact my airbags deployed. 'They were on my side. They seemed to come from the top in terms of the car door. 'There was one that came from the middle of the car. 'The one to the side came out at me and obscured my windscreen, my top windscreen, and I couldn't see. 'On impact the whole car jolted, I jolted. I felt the car move off course. I wasn't going straight any more.' Terror: The two toddlers (circled left) could be seen on CCTV footage sat in their pushchairs just moments before a car driven by Mistry (right) mounted the pavement and smashed into them . Scene: The two children were waiting with two adults at this junction in Leicester when they were hit by a car . 'RIP baby angels': Floral tributes were left at the scene where the two young children were hit by the car . She added: 'I immediately pressed the brake in the car. There was smoke in the car or that is what seemed like at the time. 'I didn't know what had hit me. I just knew I had been hit. 'I felt juddering as it (the car) mounted the kerb and I could see two poles from the vision I had from between the air bag and dashboard and then I came to a stop. 'I didn't know what had hit me. My belt locked across my chest. My stomach went tight as well, I was completely in shock.' The court heard she drove 500 miles a week in her job, and had one previous conviction for speeding in a 40mph zone, for which she undertook a speed awareness course. After the hearing, Zofia and Oliwier’s family, who wept as the verdicts were announced, were too upset to comment.

He landed himself in trouble when he declared he would support anyone but England at football. But it seems Andy Murray might have learned from the furore – by keeping his opinion over Scottish independence to himself. Murray joked in an interview ahead of the 2006 World Cup that he would be supporting anyone but England and the remark has dogged him since. Sitting on the net: Alex Salmond (right) cannot count on the public support of Andy Murray (left) after the tennis player said he would be keeping his views on Scottish independence to himself . It is still cited by some English people as a reason not to support him, even though the reigning Wimbledon champion has explained many times that he was not serious. Murray, whose girlfriend Kim Sears is English, is one of Scotland’s highest-profile celebrities. Even if he did decided to express his opinion ahead of the Scottish independence referendum, he cannot vote as he is a resident of England. Speaking at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, Murray said: ‘I will take a position. My thoughts on it aren’t that relevant because I can’t vote myself. ‘I wouldn’t personally choose to make my feelings on something like that public either because not a whole lot of good comes from it', he added. Champion: Andy Murray says it took around eight years to live the joke about England down. He admitted to only feeling truly forgiven when he won Wimbledon last year (pictured) When a 19-year-old Andy Murray joked he would be supporting 'whoever England were playing against' at the forthcoming 2006 World Cup, he turned Wimbledon crowds hostile just when he needed them most. Although he later excused it as a light-hearted jibe made during a joint interview with Englishmen Tim Henman in only his second-ever Wimbledon tournament, Murray has since admitted it cost him the support of many English tennis fans. 'I was only 19 or 20 at the time. I was still a kid, and I was getting things sent to my locker saying things like: 'I hope you lose every tennis match for the rest of your life'. That's at Wimbledon. Even people within the grounds at Wimbledon were saying that to me,' he revealed in 2012. The outrage over the joke saw Murray openly abused as he walked around the Wimbledon site during the 2006 tournament, and the Dunblane-born player admitted to seeing his previously 'unbelievable' supporter base evaporate as tennis fans struggled to come to terms with the personality behind the racket. The level of distrust among Murray's English supporters was so great that it was regularly said: 'Murray is British when he wins and Scottish when he loses'. Murray posted several messages on his website after the incident, insisting that he was not in any way 'anti-English' and pointing out he even had an English girlfriend - artist Kim Sears. He now says it took around eight years to live the joke down, with him only feeling truly forgiven when he won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics and took the title at Wimbledon last year. English resident: Andy Murray, whose long-term girlfriend Kim Sears (pictured right) is English, cannot vote in the referendum as he does not live in Scotland. Murray was given an OBE at Buckingham Palace last year . Explaining why he's choosing not to go public with his opinion, Murray went on to say: 'I don’t know a whole lot about politics. I have made that mistake in the past and it’s caused me a headache for seven or eight years of my life and a lot of abuse.' ‘So I wouldn’t consider getting involved in something like that ever again.’ Murray’s comments mean he has backtracked on what he said following his Wimbledon triumph last summer, when he stated he would say what side he was on once he had made up his mind. Murray spoke after beating Lukas Rosol 4-6,  6-3, 6-2 in the second round of the competition.","Murray says he will be keeping opinions on Scottish independence private .

Looks help men get ahead in business - but attractive women face a battle to climb the ladder, according to new research. A study showed investors are more likely to put money into ventures if the man making the pitch is handsome. However, female entrepreneurs blessed with good looks are no more likely to be successful than their less physically endowed counterparts. Blessing or curse? Good-looking businessmen like Twitter's Jack Dorsey will climb the ladder easily but their female equivalent such as Ultimo's Michelle Mone will not have found it so simple, the study says . The findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also suggest there is a glass ceiling for women in the corporate world because backers prefer presentations from men. In Britain, just four FTSE 100 companies have female chief executives, and 90 per cent of growing venture capital firms in the US are founded or led by men. Researchers at Harvard Business School recruited 60 experienced and affluent backers to view video recordings of 90 randomly-selected verbal business pitches made by entrepreneurs from various business sectors at three contests in the US. The investors - who were unaware of each contest's outcome - were asked to rate the looks of the entrepreneurs. Though Karren Brady achieved world fame as an entrepreneur, the study claims her looks won't have helped . Did Tumblr CEO David Karp's youthful looks help him reach one of the top jobs in media? Among the women, those who were deemed attractive were not necessarily the most effective speakers. Conversely, attractive men were thought to give the best presentations. The panel also found male voices were much better at securing deals than female ones. Dr Alison Brooks, of Harvard Business School, said: 'We identifiy a profound and consistent sex gap in entrepreneurship - a central path to job creation, economic growth and prosperity. 'Across a field setting and two controlled experiments we find investors prefer entrepreneurial pitches presented by males compared with picthes presented by females - even when the content of the pitch is the same. Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts - who is soon moving to Apple Inc - is very attractive but that will not have been a factor in her climb to success, Harvard Business School found, whereas it may have helped Peter Jones . 'Attractive males are particularly persuasive whereas physical attractiveness does not matter among female entrepreneurs. 'These findings fundamentally advance the science related to sex, physical attractiveness, psychological persuasion, bias, role expectations and entrepreneurship. 'To the extent female entrepreneurs are disadvantaged in entrepreneurial pitching simply by virtue of their sex then women may remain under-represented in the entrepreneurial economy. 'Moreover the power of male attractiveness to persuade evaluators to select one pitch over another suggests entrepreneurial opportunities may also be unevenly distributed even within the male population.'","Harvard Business School found attractive men consistently secure deals .

A rare copy of a Jules Verne science-fiction novel, which imagined man landing on the moon more than 100 years before Neil Armstrong set foot its surface, has been sold for £1,600. De La Terre a la Lune (From Earth to the Moon) was written in 1865 and tells the story of an attempt to fire man to the moon using an enormous gun. In the book, part of Verne's Voyages Extraordinaires (Extraordinary Journeys) series, three men are blasted into space from a launch site in Florida. On their return from the mission they land back in the Pacific Ocean where they are rescued by the US Navy. In recognition of the similarities between the story and the actual events of 1969, when Neil Armstrong became the first man on the moon, the book was signed by a host of NASA experts. Among the 25 signatures is that of German engineer Wernher von Braun, the man behind the Saturn V rocket which launched Apollo XI into space. Von Braun invented the V-2 rocket for the Nazis in the Second World War, 3,000 of which were launched on Allied targets including London. In 1945, with German defeat inevitable, von Braun and his team surrendered to American forces and helped them develop rockets befoere turning his attentions to space flight. In 1958 NASA was formed and von Braun was made the first director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in 1960. Bill Anders, one of the first astronauts to orbit the moon on the Apollo VIII mission in 1968, and Tom Stafford, commander of Apollo V, also signed the book. Similarities: The inside of the book's cover was signed by a number of astronauts and scientists, including Wernher von Braun, who was behind the Saturn 2 rocket . View: Included with the rare book is a photo taken from the Apollo spacecraft when it orbited the moon . The story was so ahead of its time that Michael Collins, commander of the Apollo 11 mission, mentioned it as his crew prepared to re-enter Earth's atmosphere in July 1969. In a message to mission control at Houston, Collins said: 'A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the moon. 'His spaceship, Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the moon. 'It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern-day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow.'

Criticism: Leader of Aberdeen City Council, Councillor Barney Crockett, has been accused of using taxpayers' cash to fund a 'jolly' to Japan . A council leader has been accused of spending thousands of taxpayers’ cash on a 'jolly' to Japan. Councillor Barney Crockett spent six days in the Far East so he could visit to the International Hydrogen Fuel Expo. But he is alleged to have spent just 90 minutes in a meeting about hydrogen at the expo and much of the remainder of the trip visiting tourist sights and hosting dinners. Rival politician Callum McCaig, of the SNP, said: 'I don’t think this is justifiable. 'From the agenda I’ve seen the visit was incredibly light on real work and has all the hallmarks of a jolly. 'It is full of visits, wining and dining that would be beyond the means of most people.' A council spokeswoman confirmed the 11,000-mile round trip last month cost £2103.86 per person - totalling more than £8,000 - which came out of the council's general fund which is approximately £380million a year. A spokesman for the Taxpayer’s Alliance Scotland said: 'What are the priorities when a councillor chooses a long-distance jolly rather than serve his own community? 'We all know Aberdeen has huge assets in this [hydrogen] sector but there is no need to promote these abilities at such a huge expense when they’re known globally.' Cllr Crockett, leader of Aberdeen City Council, hit back at his critics, saying: 'I was at the conference for a lot longer than an hour and a half. 'I think how the trip built up was of great support to hydrogen projects in the city which have a huge importance for the area. 'This is just more of the smear and bullying tactics we are seeing from the SNP, and they are trying to personalise it. But if I think something is right for the city then I will do it.' Aberdeen City Council, pictured, spent more than £8,000 sending four representatives of the council to a conference on hydrogen in Japan . The trip included visits to Kosuge slip-dock which was designed in part by Scotsman Thomas Blake Glover, the man-made Dejima island and the man-made Nagasaki peace park which commemorates the atomic bombing in 1945. The four man delegation also dined with the mayor of Nagasaki, chairman of the city council, Nagasaki Rotary Club and the Japan-British Society of Nagasaki during the visit. Councillor Willie Young, Convener of Aberdeen City Council's Finance, Policy and Resources Committee argued that the trip was of vital importance as the council is heavily investing in hydrogen fuel. He said: 'Of course there's always private time on any trip but lots of important engagements took place. 'We spent 90 minutes in a meeting at the expo but we were at the conference for more than four hours in total. 'Every single day there were specific meetings about hydrogen. These were extremely valuable and worthwhile as the council is putting £10million of public money into hydrogen-run buses.' A council spokeswoman added: 'The trip was unanimously approved by the Enterprise, Strategic Planning and Infrastructure Committee in August. But it is claimed Cllr Barney Crockett, pictured, and those who joined him on the trip had a meeting lasting just 90 minutes at the expo and spent the rest of their six-day trip sight-seeing and hosting dinners . 'Aberdeen is leading on hydrogen for the Scottish Cities Alliance and the purpose of the trip was to attend and participate in an important conference on hydrogen and associated technologies, as well as to meet with potential partners, including in the automotive industry, who have expressed an interest in working with Aberdeen on its various hydrogen projects which will establish a hydrogen economy and secure Aberdeen's position as a leading world energy city for the future.' But SNP Group Leader Callum McCaig claims this trip did little to promote Aberdeen and its hydrogen economy - which was one of the main reasons it went ahead. He said: 'We were told that the trip would promote Aberdeen and the hydrogen economy however this does not seem to have been high on the agenda. 'With only 90 minutes of meetings scheduled and lots of sightseeing and dining out. 'Indeed, when challenged directly on television, Cllr Crockett specifically denied that he was on a jolly, and claimed he was working flat out for the city. It is now clear that this was absolutely not the case, and it is clear that he appeared to think nobody would find out the truth. 'Cllr Crockett appears to have become very fond of overseas travel, like when he wastefully flew to New York to collect an award for an arms-length body and now he has gone to Japan for 90 minutes of meetings. 'This is yet another example of how the Council Leader and Finance Convenor are mismanaging this council.'

But despite his plight, Steve has been safely returned to the centre - and is making good progress. General manager, Mark Bradbury, said: 'We have a lot of display gardens and big ponds outside the centre, featuring fish that are not for sale. 'Steve lives in one of those ponds and he escaped, along with his friend - a large koi carp fish named Chadwick - when we were flooded. Journey: During his one-mile trip, Steve swam across a main road, flooded fields and a petrol station forecourt . Pleased: Mark Bradbury, general manager of the aquatic centre, said staff at the car wash had been shocked by Steve. 'The staff were a bit taken aback because sturgeons look quite shark-like,' said Mr Bradbury . 'As the weeks passed, eventually the water began to subside, and then we got a call from staff at a car wash about one mile away. 'They said they thought they’d found one of our fish in a puddle and they were a bit taken aback because sturgeons look quite shark-like. 'But sure enough, there he was alive and well. He’d been living in the deep puddle at the car wash.' Mr Bradbury said that Steve had been 'a bit worse for wear' with several 'bumps and scratches' when he was found.

The fish was later discovered in 'a bit worse for wear' state, sporting several bumps and scratches' 'We couldn’t believe he had got so far, because his route would have included travelling across fields, a main road and around the petrol station,' he said. 'We don’t know if he went through the car wash, but medics say he is making a good recovery back with his friends at the centre.

But this idyllic 12th century church could not survive the fire that ripped through it hours before last Sunday's service. The once-iconic wooden vestry was destroyed, leaving its bells missing amid the rubble. Almost destroyed: The original roof and many pews were destroyed in the blaze that tore through the church . Firefighters battled the blaze for an hour at St Andrews Church in Romsey, Hampshire, just three-and-a-half hours before its regular Sunday service. Too dangerous for them to go inside, they used six pumps to put out the flames and stayed for several hours to prevent the fire flaring again. Only some of the church's treasures, including an irreplaceable 1613 'chained' Bible, were saved. A 13th century wooden chest was badly damaged and a limestone font, with graffiti from 1681, was severely damaged, possibly beyond repair. The West Window, in memory of a much-loved churchwarden Bill Watkinson, was destroyed. The bells of St Andrews Church in Romsey, Hampshire, the same ones from 1212, have been lost in the rubble . Around half of the roof at the west end has been gutted but the east end is relatively unscathed, including a 13th century screen. Churchwarden Catherine Baker said: 'I can't really believe it. 'I was called by a neighbour who saw smoke and I could hear the crackling. I feel absolute horror. 'The most shocking thing was seeing the flames. As far as I know we have never had a fire before. 'If the fire brigade had not got here the roof would have been completely destroyed. 'They have been wonderful, as have all the neighbours who raised the alarm. 'My husband Bill and daughter Isabel, who were first on the scene, saw things falling off the roof.

Churchgoer Peter Pritchett-Brown said: 'It is awful to see something like this happen to something that has stood here for so long.' The little 20 metres by eight metres church was due to hold a Sunday service at 11am for its 20 regular worshippers. However, parishioners gathered for prayers in a nearby house with Rev Canon Steve Pittis. The alarm was raised at 7.27am and the cause of the blaze is unclear and is still being investigated. Nobody was injured. Fire borough commander Dan Tasker said: 'The damage is quite extensive. 'The fire started at one end and spread into the roof and, unfortunately, half has been destroyed. 'It was a well-developed fire when the first crews arrived but the crews worked incredibly hard to stop it spreading.'","St Andrews Church, Romsey, Hampshire, burned out hours before service .

A mother-of-four said she thought she was going to die after a large snake crawled into her bed while she slept and bit her on the breast. Caroline Griffin, 49, had no idea if the four foot snake was poisonous after it found its way beneath her duvet and sank its fangs into her chest while she slept at her home in Guardbridge, Fife. Thankfully the creature was a harmless brown belly California kingsnake which had escaped from a neighbour's home six months earlier. 'The fright of my life': Caroline Griffin (right) said she thought she was going to die after a brown belly California kingsnake found its way into her bed and sank its fangs into her breast (left) The single mother of two girls and two boys said she woke up after feeling an unusual movement beneath her sheets. Throwing back the duvet, Ms Griffin saw the large snake resting on her chest and started to scream. The snake then bit into her breast, leaving bruising and puncture marks. Describing the incident, Ms Griffin told the Daily Record: 'I was about to get up to get the kids ready to go to school when I threw the duvet back and saw it sitting on my chest.' 'I thought the kids were playing some sort of trick on me at first. Then I saw it move and I got the fright of my life. 'As soon as I started to scream, it bit me on the breast. It was quite sore... I thought I was going to die.' On the loose: The snake's owner Gareth Niven (pictured) said Hiss escaped from his tank six months ago. He thinks Hiss is likely to have been living in a derelict house that separates his and Ms Griffin's properties . Painful: Caroline Griffin says she screamed and tried to sit up when she realised there was an animal in her bed. At this point the snake bit into her breast, leaving bruising and puncture marks . As she suffered no immediate sickness as a result of the bite, Ms Griffin asked her children Laura, 24, Michael, 21, Emily, 16 and DJ, 13, to take photographs of the snake and call the Scottish SPCA for assistance. She also told her neighbours what had happened. News spread along the street and a short time later the snake's owner Gareth Niven, 21, arrived at her front door to collect it. After calling Scottish SPCA to say Mr Niven had come forward, a driver for the animal charity . turned his vehicle around and the job was cancelled. Mr Niven said the snake, which he calls Hiss, had escaped from his tank six months earlier and is likely to have been living in a derelict house that separates his and Ms Griffin's properties. It is believed council workers who recently visited the abandoned house may have disturbed Hiss and caused him to move into Ms Griffin's home. Help: As she suffered no immediate ill health as a result of the bite, Ms Griffin asked her children to take photographs of the snake and call the Scottish SPCA . Knowing full well that Hiss - like all kingsnakes - has no venom, Mr Niven simply scooped him up in an empty pillowcase and took him home. Although Hiss seems more aggressive than usual, this is probably a result of hunger and the fact he has had to fend for himself for the last six months, Mr Niven said. Despite there being no risk to Ms Griffin as a result of the bite, kingsnakes are constrictors and the reptile may have killed her had it wrapped itself around her neck. Worryingly its not the first time Hiss has escaped from his tank. During a previous bid for freedom, he was on the loose in the neighbourhood for two years. Mr Niven even admitted the reptile is nicknamed 'Houdini' such is his ability to push his way out the enclosure.","Large snake crawled beneath Caroline Griffin's duvet while she slept .

Failed: Andrew Prentice was let down by his local council and NHS trust, an official report has ruled . A seriously ill man died from an overdose of medication after he was left to administer his own treatment by his local council and NHS trust. Andrew Prentice suffered from pancreatitis for more than two decades before his death at the age of 38, during which time he lost his home and job and his marriage fell apart. Now Somerset County Council and Somerset Partnership NHS Trust have been criticised for failing the patient by not helping him administer the powerful medication he needed. Two ombudsmen, one for local government and another with responsibility for health, ordered officials to apologise to Mr Prentice's mother Brenda, who has campaigned since her son's death five years ago. 'If the problems had been recognised and sincere apologies given in the beginning and lessons learned this would not have been necessary,' said Mrs Prentice, 71. 'Deny, defend, delay is often the case with authorities. We need openness, fairness and transparency. I was pleased that the ombudsmen took my complaints seriously.' Mr Prentice, once a promising sportsman, developed pancreatitis overnight at the age of 15 and had to have his pancreas removed. He found a job in a shop and got married, but he suffered from chronic abdominal pain, frequently vomited, became diabetic and suffered fits and collapses. After losing his job, home and marriage, he started suffering from depression, and in July 2009 died from an overdose of prescription drugs. At an inquest into his death, a coroner heard that the drugs left him so confused he could not remember whether or not he had taken his medication. However, he recorded an open verdict because he said it was impossible to determine if he had intended to kill himself. Campaign: Brenda Prentice has fought for justice for her son since his death from a drug overdose in 2009 . In the report into Mr Prentice's death released last week, Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman Julie Mellor said the NHS trust 'failed' Mr Prentice. She added: 'This tragic case highlights the importance of joined-up care. It is crucial that the NHS and local authorities communicate with each other to ensure patients' needs are met. 'One missed opportunity by staff can lead to tragic consequences. Staff need to feel empowered to intervene and alert others when they have concerns about a patient. 'The trust failed this young man and it needs to ensure that its staff are appropriately trained in caring for vulnerable people, so that other patients receive the high quality care they deserve.' Jane Martin of the Local Government Ombudsman said failures to monitor his medication 'may have contributed' to his death. She added: 'The picture I have seen is one of a gradual decline in the man's health with no effective intervention to prevent it. 'While you cannot put a price on the loss of a loved one, I have recommended a financial payment to the man's family in recognition of the stress and strain this situation must have placed them under.' Vulnerable: Mr Prentice was left to administer his own medication despite his chronic illness . The report also said the council should refund Mr Prentice's relatives for any care given and review its policy on liaison with internal and external housing agencies. Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said that at the time of the patient's death, the trust was not in charge of managing district nurses. A spokesman added: 'We have made considerable progress on this process of integration over the last two years and we are pleased to see this acknowledged in the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman's comments. 'The trust has offered its sincere condolences to the family over the circumstances of Andrew's death and we will write to them again outlining the actions we have taken once we have considered fully the detail of the report.' Somerset County Council said it was considering the report's findings and was not in a position to comment at this stage. It added: 'We do, of course, offer our sincere sympathies to all friends and family.'","Andrew Prentice was diagnosed with pancreatitis at the age of 15 .

Family liaison officer: Jeffrey Davies, 42, was jailed for three years at Swansea Crown Court in August 2013 for taking advantage of the women . Two policemen have been sacked for mocking women who made sexual complaints against another officer. The detectives failed to investigate complaints against their colleague Detective Constable Jeffrey Davies, 42, and instead used ‘repulsive language and poked fun’ at his victims. The Independent Police Complaints Commission was called in after South Wales Police family liaison officer Davies was later jailed for three years for taking advantage of the women, who were victims of domestic abuse. Both women complained about Davies, but the IPCC found his senior officers ignored this. Instead they made ‘lewd’ and ‘sexual’ remarks about them in official emails - and even made up an office quiz based on their complaints. One officer ‘poked fun’ at a woman allegedly flashed at by Davies. Detective Inspector Phillip Camm and Detective Sergeant Richard Jones were both found guilty of gross misconduct after five-day disciplinary hearing. The force has sacked both of them. IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: ‘The women were not treated as victims of a sexual offence and their allegations were not investigated effectively. ‘The investigation also revealed a CID unit pervaded with what could be described as a canteen culture where inappropriate comments and behaviour were viewed as harmless banter. ‘The language demonstrated in emails and documents was, in fact, grossly unprofessional, offensive and demonstrated a lack of respect for the women complaining. ‘I read with a sense of repulsion the sexual content of comments made by Detective Sergeant Jones, both in his emails and in the two documents found on his computer.’ Base: Detective Sergeant Richard Jones was Davies's line manager and Detective Inspector Phillip Camm his supervisor at Merthyr Tydfil police station (pictured) in South Wales . She added: ‘The allegations made against Jeffrey Davies were extremely serious and should have been treated that way. ‘They were vulnerable women who had turned to the police for help and had found themselves subjected to an appalling abuse of trust. ‘Their dreadful experience was then further compounded by the inactions of Jeffrey Davies’s supervisors who failed to deal properly with the criminal allegations against him.’ Jones deleted offensive emails when he discovered the IPCC were investigating. And Camm lied to the IPCC when he was being interviewed about the handling of the allegations made by two complainants, known only as Woman A and Woman B. Det Sgt Jones was Davies’s line manager and Det Insp Camm his supervisor at Merthyr Tydfil police station in South Wales. Unimpressed: Independent Police Complaints Commission commissioner Jan Williams said the women's allegations 'were not investigated effectively' The IPCC investigation discovered a . ‘canteen culture’ in the CID unit where officers joked about victims of . the sexual assaults in 2011. Chief Constable of South Wales Police Peter . Vaughan said: ‘From myself to our front-line officers of South Wales . Police are shocked and feel deeply let down by the behaviour of these . officers. ‘Let us be in no . doubt, we owe the women affected a sincere apology as the conduct of . these officers fell well short of the standards I expect from South . Wales Police. ‘As part of . the investigation into their conduct a number of offensive and . inappropriate emails and documents came to light which were prepared by . Sergeant Jones and seen by Inspector Camm, who failed to challenge them. ‘I . have to make it clear that this is behaviour I simply don’t recognise . within South Wales Police. We have examined thousands of emails to see . if such behaviour was more common. ‘Quite . simply it is not and evidently, the vast majority of our 5,000 officers . and staff know that there is absolutely no place for lewd and offensive . communication and it will not be tolerated. ‘Everyone . throughout South Wales Police knows the values and standards which are . expected from them, we train them in these standards and on promotion. ‘I tell every manager that they have an absolute duty to challenge inappropriate behaviour and conduct. ‘Sergeant . Jones and Inspector Camm failed to act in the professional manner that I . expect of my officers. Their dismissals show that we will always be . robust when it comes to staff misconduct. ‘At the same time, every year our front-line staff and specialist teams support hundreds of victims of sexual offences. ‘Leaders across the force are ensuring that we do our very best to protect vulnerable people and respond to their needs.’ Camm failed to refer the complaint of indecent exposure by ‘Woman B’ to the professional standards department and did not treat her as a victim of a sexual offence. He was also found guilty of failing to carry out an effective investigation and treated the allegation as a malicious complaint. Det Sgt Jones failed to refer ‘Woman A’s’ complaint of indecent assault to the professional standards department. The IPCC investigation found the women’s allegations were not reported to the professional standards department of South Wales Police. Commissioner Williams said they were ‘littered with lewd language’ and showed a total lack of empathy and respect for a victim who had shown ‘real courage’ to report an allegation of indecent exposure against a police officer. She said: ‘He treated her complaint as sport, to be used as part of a quiz with colleagues outside work. This was outrageous and demonstrates the contempt in which the woman and her allegation was held. ‘Detective Sergeant Jones then tried to hide the evidence of his behaviour by deleting documents from his computer when he became aware of our investigation. ‘Inspector Camm failed to challenge his team’s behaviour and lied to the IPCC during an interview. It is only right that these officers have been dismissed. ‘Their failure to challenge inappropriate behaviour strikes at the heart of confidence in policing and tarnishes the good work done by officers every day.’ The IPCC met with Woman A and Woman B last week to share the findings of the report with them and explained the officers had been sacked. Commissioner Williams said: ‘It is vitally important that other officers are confident that they will be supported if they challenge inappropriate behaviour. ‘Victims of crime must also feel that they can have confidence to speak to an officer, and be treated with dignity and respect.’ Davies was jailed for three years at Swansea Crown Court in August 2013 after being convicted of two counts of sexual assault against two women he was meant to be looking after. He was cleared of a further offence of exposure against Woman B.","Officers failed to investigate complaints against colleague Jeffrey Davies .

Killer: Convicted double-murderer Ian McLoughlin (pictured) killed Graham Buck in Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while he was on day release last July . Prisoners are set to lose their automatic right to day release following a series of serious crimes committed by offenders temporarily out of jail, including murder, robbery and drug smuggling. Under new rules, inmates will be allowed out only for a specific purpose, such as work experience, and prisoners on day release will have to wear tags. They will also have to earn the privilege of day release through good behaviour and demonstrating a commitment to change - rather than automatically qualifying as they have previously. Convicted double-murderer Ian McLoughlin's killing of Graham Buck in Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while he was on day release last July is among three serious failings cited by the Ministry of Justice for the change. Prisoners convicted of the most serious crimes must meet new 'restricted' criteria which will be stringently assessed by probation officers and other professionals. Temporary release is supposedly an opportunity to help inmates begin to adjust to life on the outside. But the spate of criminality prompted a review by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to confront what appeared to be a gaping hole in the supervision of extremely dangerous men. McLoughlin, who had already killed twice, was on his first unescorted day out of prison when he went to rob a house and killed Mr Buck, 66, who had gone to his neighbour Francis Cory-Wright's aid. Family man: McLoughlin, who had already killed twice, was on his first unescorted day out of prison when he went to rob a house and killed Mr Buck (circled above) who had gone to neighbour Francis Cory-Wright's aid . In another case, convicted murderer Joseph Williams committed 11 armed robberies from bookmakers over six months as he worked as a van driver on day release. The 52-year-old had been serving a life sentence for battering a sociology lecturer to death with a hammer while high on crack. He was caught after crashing into an unmarked police car. Williams, from Bolton, was jailed for life in 1996, but was released on day leave in 2010 from HMP Blantyre House in Kent. In September 2011 he was jailed indefinitely at the Old Bailey. Offenders: Meanwhile, murderer Joseph Williams (left) committed 11 armed robberies as he worked as a van driver on day release, and drug dealer Mark Neville (right) ran a £14million cocaine-smuggling operation . A third offender, convicted drug dealer Mark Neville, ran a £14million cocaine-smuggling operation while on day release from Kirkham open prison, Lancashire. Even though he was serving eight years for a plot to smuggle heroin into Britain, he was allowed out to run a second-hand shop, which he used as a front to smuggle cocaine into the country inside old furniture. In 2010 he was jailed for a further 26 years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to import Class A and Class B drugs. Review: The spate of criminality prompted a review by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (pictured) Day release is given to hundreds of prisoners every year to allow them to prepare for their eventual freedom. But a report published last year revealed staggering levels of complacency around how such cases are handled. Inspectors said such inmates were being allowed out on day release without proper checks on whether they still pose a threat. At one unnamed prison, standards had become so lax that formal risk assessments had been abandoned. Some officials had spent so long in a prisoner's company they ended up believing the inmate's own twisted account of their crime. In some cases, reports amounted to little more than 'recording the prisoners' expressed views', the report said. Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said that he was not willing to see public safety compromised by a 'system that has been too lax up to now.' 'Temporary release can be an important tool in helping offenders reintegrate but it should not be an automatic right and we must do all we can to ensure that it does not lead to a permanent blight on innocent members of society,' he told The Times. 'In future when prisoners are let out on licence I want to be sure they are tagged and strictly risk-assessed so we know where they have been and can be sure sure that they have been tested in the community under strict conditions before being released.' Campaigners have criticised the move - saying there had been only a few failures. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, told the BBC: ‘For a government committed to rehabilitation, justice ministers should feel ashamed that only a quarter of men, and fewer than one in 10 women, leave prison with a job to go to, and proud that their well-established release on temporary licence programme has worked over years to help thousands of prisoners go straight on release. ‘Now, in the face of a thankfully few terrible cases, and for the sake of a tough headline, they risk destroying a programme that has proved its worth instead of investigating its few failures and learning from its many successes.’","Hundreds of prisoners automatically qualify for day release every year .

The blaze, which apparently broke out because of an electrical short circuit on Sunday, has left them completely destitute with nowhere to sleep at night. Firefighters attempted to put out the blaze at the Bhimsengola slum in Kathmandu but the 50-odd makeshift bamboo huts, which served as the squatters' homes, burnt to the ground in a matter of minutes.

Five fire engines and two tankers were deployed to the scene around 1pm, along with Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army. Three surrounding buildings also suffered fire damage but firefighters managed to extinguish the blaze before it spread any further. Many residents could be seen crying in the street or rifling through the rubble in the hopes of finding some surviving remnants of their homes or something of value. Most will now have no choice put to start sleeping rough on the streets.

However, the houses have been completely destroyed.' Kathmandu is home to nearly 50,000 squatters spread across the city's slums, which are often located along the Bagmati river in areas at risk of landslides. Most slums are seriously overcrowded with several people living in a single room leading to the spread of diseases. Many slum residents are under threat of being evicted to make way for developments as the Government hopes to clean up the area and promote new business.

I was at Carrow Road on Saturday, Stoke missed some chances because their strikers are useless, then Norwich took control of the game, before Stoke got a dodgy penalty and Jon Walters got himself needlessly sent off. Norwich were unlucky not to win. The Jon Walters Question… . Is Jon Walters really a Premier League player? What do you think? He . left a foot in high on Alex Tettey and he thoroughly deserved his red . card. There was no need to do it – what was going through Walters’ mind? Walters was captain at . his previous club Ipswich Town, but he showed no leadership on . Saturday, he let his Stoke team-mates down. There . are many who criticise the Premier League for a lack of quality. Walters is their poster boy. He works hard, and that’s about it. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reactions from Chris Hughton and Mark Hughes . Grafter: Jonathan Walters is the epitome of the Stoke team with his industry, but he showed a lack of leadership in getting sent off . It’s an admirable quality for sure, . but Premier League players should have the whole package, or something . special that separates them from mere mortal footballers. Walters’ story is an example to many in that he was a bit wayward as a . youngster, released by top flight clubs, and fought his way back. Saturday’s . red card aside, he has become a true professional, and that should be . admired. However, that alone shouldn’t be enough to sustain a top flight . career. Maybe I’ve been missing that secret something that makes Walters special. Too . many ex-professionals and pundits are blandly kind about footballers. I . just tell the truth as I see it. I think even some of those who feel . they have to be nice about Walters, agree deep down with what I’m . saying. It’s not rocket science… . Neither side is prolific and I wasn’t expecting a goalfest. The goals that came were not down to great attacking play – Ryan Shawcross must have objected to Bradley Johnson’s BO because he inexplicably stepped away from his man at a set-piece and Johnson headed home. Poor defending. Stoke’s equaliser was a dodgy penalty. Breakthrough: It took 56 minutes before Bradley Johnson headed in for Norwich to open the scoring against Stoke at Carrow Road . Delight: Johnson runs away to celebrate with Nathan Redmond after the goal . Spot on: Jonathan Walters earned Stoke a point by converting a 73rd-minute penalty . Shush: Walters expressed delight at his equaliser but he was later sent off for a high challenge on Alex Tettey . Looking over their shoulder: Both Stoke and Norwich are not entirely clear of the relegation dogfight . There are different reasons why these two sides don’t score enough goals: Stoke’s strikers aren’t good enough, Crouch’s best days are behind him. He sometimes struggles to work out whether to use his head or feet, taking so long to make a simple decision the chance is gone. Let’s just say he’s long since stopped playing off instinct. Crouch also missed a one-on-one early on which set the tone for his 90 minutes. Is Walters the slowest player in the Premier League? He’s way too slow to cause enough problems. Stoke need pace and they need a finisher. Actually they need new strikers in the summer, it really is that simple. Lost instincts: Peter Crouch didn't have his most impressive display against Norwich . High boot: Walters was dismissed for a challenge of Alexander Tettey during the closing stages of the match, but Norwich were unable to grab a winner . Seeing red: Referee Andre Marriner sends Walters for an early bath . CLICK HERE TO READ OUR MATCH REPORT FROM CARROW ROAD BY PETER HARRIS . Norwich have finishers in Ricky van Wolfswinkel and Gary Hooper – check their records at other clubs, they’re prolific. But they don’t get the service. In central midfield, Wes Hoolahan is their creative spark but he’s not creative enough, not consistently game in game out. Robert Snodgrass and Russell Martin were very wasteful with their delivery on the right, Martin Olsson is perhaps guilty of being too cautious on the left – I’d love to see him marauding more down the flank and on the few occasions he has done that this season he’s made a difference. The star man is Nathan Redmond, he’s fantastic. So good on the ball, his feet are quick and he can take on his man. His final delivery isn’t quite good enough, whether that’s a cross or a shot. He’s being played out wide but I reckon he’d be a superstar in the hole. If Chris Hughton is brave enough to put him there, I think Norwich could flourish. Those strikers need to be given more clear-cut chances, the Canaries need to be cleverer. Star man: Nathan Redmond was again impressive for Norwich with his pace and ability to take on defenders . The most ironic penalty of the season… . Go back through some games this season and you’ll find Stoke defenders regularly pulling and pushing, barging and holding opponents as they are trying to keep the ball out of Asmir Begovic’s net. Rarely do they have penalties given against them. Disbelief: Sebastien Bassong reacts after being adjudged to have fouled John Guidetti, leading to Stoke's equaliser . Yet here at Carrow Road, Sebastien Bassong and John Guidetti went for a ball together, both were equally physical, Guidetti ended up on the ground, the referee gave a penalty. I couldn’t see it. How do Stoke get away with persistent fouling when they’re defending, and yet they benefited from a frankly ridiculous penalty gifted to them at Norwich. The most pointless loan move of the season … . Has to be Sweden’s Guidetti switching from Manchester City to Stoke. Before the game the promising striker had played just 40 minutes of football for Stoke since joining in January. At Norwich he came on after 63 minutes (he came on for Peter Odemwingie who I didn’t realise was playing), won a dubious penalty, and then was substituted 17 minutes later after Walters’ red card. Used sparingly: John Guidetti, on loan from Manchester City, came on as a substitute, won a penalty that Walters (right) converted, and was then subbed off again when Walter got a red card . That won’t please the Swede who was already expressing frustration at a lack of game time under Mark Hughes before January had drawn to a close. Guidetti scored 20 goals in 23 games for Feyenoord two seasons ago. Stoke lack a decent finisher. Your work it out for yourselves. You’d think Hughes, a great striker in his day, would be able to join up the dots on that one. At least Walters’ red card means Guidetti should get a chance. Never forget your history… . Norwich City devoted the matchday to one of their legends, Duncan Forbes. He was a bruising centre half who spent 33 years at Carrow Road on and off the pitch. Now aged 72, Forbes is suffering with Alzheimer's, and is now in a care home. Sadly he was unable to attend the game, but some of his former team-mates including Martin Peters, were there, along with Forbes’ wife and family. Norwich City raised money for Alzheimer's UK on the day. All clubs have their legends, some have more than others. It’s a beautiful thing that Norwich City did on Saturday: not just fund-raising, but also ensuring new generations of Norwich fans never forget the legends.

Mr Merry, who has been to BJ’s Bingo Hall in Kitts Green, Birmingham, four times a week for the last eight years, has now been banned, and all because he made what he believes was a harmless 'joke'. He fumed: 'Everyone whistles when number 11 comes out, I was just having a bit of banter. I don’t know why they (the management) singled me out. 'To start with, they said it’s a private club and they didn’t have to give a reason for barring me. 'To be honest, I did argue and refuse to leave, which was wrong, but I was exasperated. I did get a bit upset, I certainly wasn’t aggressive. 'My face just didn’t fit, there was a minority of people in there who seemed to be prejudiced against me from the moment I arrived. 'On the day it was quite weird. I whistled at the call for ‘Legs 11’ with other people, and the caller actually came over to me and shouted at me to stop whistling saying it was sexist. 'I thought nothing of that and was waiting for one final number to get a full house. 'When I didn’t get it I said ""stuff"" it’ in jest, it was a joke.

A passenger plane carrying 65 passengers and crew came within seconds of crashing into a 285ft-tall bridge over the Mersey, it was reported yesterday. Disaster was only prevented when an alarm went off in the cockpit of the Flybe flight to Liverpool from the Isle of Man after the pilot descended into a collision course with the Runcorn Bridge in Cheshire. The drama was among a catalogue of safety scares including pilots being dazzled by lasers, passenger violence and mayday alerts involving planes leaving and landing at Liverpoolâ€™s John Lennon Airport in 2013. A Flybe flight had a near-miss with Runcorn Bridge as it came in to land, according to an Air Accident Investigation Branch report (file picture) The passenger plane was just seconds away from colliding with the bridge (pictured) as it came in to land, the report has suggested . The autopilot was disengaged when the co-pilot prepared to land the early-morning flight in June this year, according to the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report. As he approached the road bridge, the planeâ€™s ground proximity warning system (EGPWS) sounded. The report revealed that the plane was descending at a rate of 2,000 feet a minute and the alert was made at just 894ft. The Runcorn Bridge stands 285ft tall over the River Mersey. A bulletin by the AAIB, which investigates serious air incidents, said: 'Potential conflict with terrain or an obstacle results in the EGPWS providing a visual and audio caution or warning alert. 'The obstacle concerned in the case was not positively identified but was possibly the Runcorn Bridge.' The plane was four miles from John Lennon Airport when the near-miss happened . The Flybe flight from the Isle of Man was coming in to land at John Lennon Airport earlier this year when the collision nearly took place (file picture) The incident was among a number of safety scares involving planes leaving and landing at the airport throughout the year (file picture) The report adds that the flight crew took 'appropriate action' to correct the danger and made a safe landing. Flybe has said while the safety of the flight was not compromised at any time, actions have since been taken to improve safety. A spokesman said: 'Flybe confirms that safety of its passengers and crew is its number one priority. In 2013, there were 128 reports of incidents at John Lennon Airport, including 45 laser pen attacks on flights to and from the airport. Other incidents included: . 'The event highlighted in the AAIB report was thoroughly investigated by our own investigators and through correspondence with the AAIB. 'Both parties concluded that at no time was the safety of the flight compromised; however, in light of the event, and despite the AAIB making no recommendations, Flybe has taken a number of actions to further improve safety.' The incident was documented in reports which airlines are legally-bound to submit to the industry watchdog, the Civil Aviation Authority. The CAA said the open culture of reporting incidents made flying in the UK 'extremely safe'. A CAA spokesman said: 'The UK has an excellent aviation safety record. In terms of large commercially operated aeroplanes, the UK fatal accident rate is half that of the rest of the world combined. 'Because there is a legal obligation on airlines to report all safety incidents to us, no matter how seemingly trivial, we are able to share that information with other airlines to learn lessons.' A JLA spokesman said: 'The report from the CAA relating to Liverpool John Lennon Airport needs to be put into context as it will include all manner of incidents, many far less serious than others, as well as including incidents occurring away from the airport.'","Plane carrying 65 passengers was preparing to land at John Lennon Airport .

North Korea's second-most powerful man has reappeared on TV, contradicting reports that he may have been purged from the isolated nation's leadership. Choe Ryong Hae was seen close to the country's leader Kim Jong-un in pictures taken in the past couple of months, smiling but sporting a limp. His reappearance in public refutes recent speculation that he had been purged by Kim, whose shake up of North Korea's elite included the execution of his uncle last year. All smiles: Kim Jong Un (right), smiles with Vice Marshal and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Choe Ryong Hae (centre) and Vice Marshal and the military's General Staff Chief Ri Yong Ho in 2012 . Treachery: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Choe Ryong Hae pictured in July last year, before rumours of a disappearance surfaced . Crazed: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had his uncle Jang Song Thaek executed in December last year . Choe was seen enthusiastically taking notes as Kim visited various sites, and then appeared at a firing drill on a beach, Reuters reports. The news agency did not distribute the pictures. The head of the political wing of North Korea's military, he appears to have risen to become the country's second most powerful man after the execution of Jang Song-thaek, Kim's uncle. Choe's father was a partisan who fought alongside the Kim's grandfather Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, in the guerilla war against Japanese occupation. As well as his role as chief political operative for the North's 1.2million-strong army, he holds a seat in the powerful standing committee of the ruling Workers' Party politburo shared only by Kim himself and two figurehead old guard members. Choe is also one of the two vice chairmen of the ruling Workers' Party central military commission, a post that encompasses two of the most powerful institutions, the party and the military. He was made a vice marshal of the military this year. In June, Choe was Kim's special envoy to meet President Xi Jinping of China, North Korea's only major ally. The meeting came amid annoyance from Beijing at North Korea's missile test and a third nuclear test last year. It had been thought that Choe had angered Kim by taking management of several state-owned industries. Taken out: Kim Jong-Un ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Song-Thaek (left) in December last year, after a special military tribunal found him guilty of treason . Executed: Jang Song Thaek, previously considered the second most powerful man in the secretive state, is seen with his hands bound as he is dragged into the court by uniformed personnel  shortly before his death . There are frequent reports in South Korean and other media of the demise or fall from grace of top officials in North Korea, a nuclear-armed state which is effectively closed to outsiders. Kim's uncle Jang, 67, was executed in December, after being accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime. Jang was married to Kim Kyong Hui, Kim's aunt and former leader Kim Jong-Il's sister. It has since been claimed that members of his uncle's family, including his brothers, children and grandchildren, were rounded up by the dozen following his arrest and subsequent death in December. Tension: Missiles have been fired by North Korea as a possible sign it is developing ballistic missile technology as part of its nuclear weapons program . As well as his uncle, other high-ranking members of the military are said to have been purged by Kim Jong-Un, including three defence ministers and three chiefs of the army's general staff. Kim Chol, the vice minister of the army, was reportedly put to death in October 2012 by soldiers firing mortar rounds at him. In August last year, members of a female musical group, Unhasu Orchestra - which included the dictator's ex-girlfriend - were reportedly publicly machine-gunned apparently for watching pornography and filming themselves naked. Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute thinktank near Seoul, suggested that many of the reports coming from the country are unreliable. He said: 'The Choe imprisonment rumour tells that it is hard to find out exactly what is happening inside North Korea. 'It is a problem to report information based on unreliable rumours from a source far away from Pyongyang.'","Choe Ryong Hae seen close to North Korean leader in past months .

But the signs of war are all around with sandbags everywhere, evacuation drills and RAF planes in the skies above. Months after the film was shot by St John's College student Malcolm Shaw, many of the students enlisted - and never lived to see their beloved Cambridge again.

Shaw, . who died in 2003 after a career in the chemicals industry, edited the . snapshots into a 20-minute film in 1989, and added a voiceover. His closing remarks reveal his nostalgic fondness for his student years. In 1942, all men between 18 and 51 and all women between 20 and 30 would be called up for service . He says: 'What happy days those were, and relatively carefree despite the background of a country at war.' Tracy Wilkinson, archivist at St John's College Cambridge, said: 'At one level, the film is an example of how, even though there was a lot of hardship because of the war, many people still tried to make the best of things and live as normal a life as they could. ‘What we see in Shaw's film is the . lighter side of College life. Despite his time at St John's coinciding . with the outbreak of war, the sense of there still being time for . leisure is evident.’ 'At the same time it is also quite . poignant, because it was made in 1941, a year before all male British . subjects between 18 and 51, and women between 20 and 30, became eligible . for call-up into the armed forces.

Despite . the archaic fashions and rigid formality of the 1940s, with students . wearing suits for punting on the river and being addressed by initials . and surnames, the film reveals how little life has changed for many .

Shaw’s sequences show students including Shaw himself climbing iconic Cambridge buildings: not under cover of darkness as the infamous ‘Night Climbers of Cambridge’ did a decade earlier, but in broad daylight.

Ex-member: Former Diamond Mountain member Sid Johnson told NBC's Dateline about the bizarre practices of the retreats leader Michael Roach . A new investigation into a mysterious Arizona yoga retreat - likened to cult - and the death of one of its members alleges the Princeton-educated leader condoned bizarre tantric sex rituals at his camp. It was the death of Stanford-graduate Ian Thorson from exposure and dehydration in the desert after he had been expelled from his love rivals Michael Roach's Diamond Mountain in June 2012, that shone at light on the shady religious practices of the Buddhist community. Aired on Sunday, NBC's Dateline re-examined the circumstances surrounding Thorson's passing and spoke with a former member, almost two years after he was found in a cave alongside his wife, Christie McNally who had separated from Roach three years previously. Thorson and McNally were hardcore devotees of Tibetan Buddhism, studying literally at the feet of Michael Roach at his Arizona desert compound. By all accounts, Roach demanded total obedience from his followers, that some have compared to a the megalomania of a cult. At the Buddhist Diamond Mountain retreat, nearly 40 aherents pledge to meditate for three years, three months and three days. Their only communication is by paper and pen. Mysterious end: Ian Thorson, died after fleeing a Buddhist retreat with his wife Christie McNally, right. They camped in the Aizona mountains where Thorson died of exposure and dehydration . Divisive: Roach's teachings and rituals were questioned during the course of his relationship with McNally. He and McNally lived in a yurt together, . right, for years before she left him for Thorson, their attendant . It is run by divisive Princeton-educated monk and McNally's former husband, Michael Roach, whose teachings have been rejected as unconventional by some, including the Dalai Lama. Roach, who had previously run a diamond business worth tens of millions of dollars, raised eyebrows for promoting Buddhist principles as a path to financial success, the New York Times reported in the aftermath of Thorson's death in 2012. One of his former students, yoga teacher Matthew Remski described the leader as a 'charismatic Buddhist teacher' who he respected until his popularity 'turned him into a celebrity'. Others have cited concerning initiation ceremonies. Another former volunteer, Sid Johnson, told NBC's Dateline that his involved 'kissing and genital touching'. He also made the bizarre claim that Roach, who as a Buddhist monk should not have had sex let alone marry, made unusual exceptions for bedding McNally. 'He said that he had never had sex with a human woman,' said Johnson to Dateline, explaining that Roach told his followers that McNally was a supernatural being and not a woman. According to Johnson the sexual rituals at Diamond Mountain became increasingly bizarre. 'It was so surreal, but then there was a part of me that was thinking that these were some kind of sacred rituals and perhaps something amazing is going to happen,' said Johnson. Another former follower, Buddhist monk, Lama Lobsang Nyima described walking in on Ian Thorson’s creepy devotional practice to Michael Roach. Yoga retreat: This is Diamond Mountain sanctuary in Arizona where attendees agree to live in silence for three years . 'Michael had a room in this temple in New Jersey and sometimes I would crash there,' said Nyima. 'So I walked in once and saw Ian, lying prostrate on the floor in the middle of some sort of devotion to Roach. 'He was very much intent on staying with Michael Roach - it was very clear he had some form of attraction to the teachings of Roach. Witness: Buddhist monk Lama Lobsang Nyima saw first hand the devotion of Ian Thorson to Michael Roach . 'The strong devotion that Roach asked of his followers came with a tantric element . 'There are normal relationships a Buddhist with have with his followers and then there are vows of a tantric nature. 'You have to do what they say. This can be very dangerous when taken out of context and is like a cult.' Another of his questionable practices was his secret marriage to McNally, which is forbidden by Buddhism. It lasted more than a decade and ended in 2010 - a month before she married Thorson. The couple met in New York city when he was her teacher. Despite the 20-year age gap, their friendship became something more - and they vowed never to stray more than 15ft from each other. Roach and McNally had lived together in a yurt throughout a three-year retreat he had promoted from 1999, but they claimed they were celibate and kept the marriage secret from others. But, as the New York Post reported, his version of celibacy was also questionable. Criticism: Buddhist scholar Robert Thurman, left, and the Dalai Lama, centre, both turned their backs on Roach after it came to light that he had married . 'We are not allowed to have sex, but in yoga there are practices that involve joining with a partner,' he said. 'They are secret, and you are not allowed to disclose them. You might think of them as sex, but their purpose is to move inner energy. It takes very strict training.' Together, the couple wrote books and presented lectures around the world. When the marriage came to light, Roach said he and his wife came from Christian backgrounds so they wanted to carry out a Christian partnership, as well as a Buddhist one. He added that he wanted her to be able to legally claim his possessions if he passed away. But the union garnered derision from Buddhist scholar Robert Thurman, father of actress Uma Thurman, who said he should renounce his monastic vows - but Roach refused. The Dalai Lama's office called it 'unconventional behavior' and refused to see him when he traveled to India with his students in 2006. But in 2009, McNally left Roach for Thorson, a young student who had once served as their attendant. After, Roach was seen dancing in Manhattan clubs with Russian models. He said of the break up: 'You should see your partner as an angel who came to teach you. I look at Christie that way - the education is finished and now she is teaching a new person. If you try to see it that way, it helps your heart to hurt less.' Her union with Thorson seemed far from simple.

Tragic: Thorson, right, was found by a search-and-rescue team in a cave after McNally, left, raised the alarm . She used a knife the couple had been given as a wedding present, but later claimed she was practicing martial arts and it went wrong. He suffered three stab wounds to the chest. In a letter written after they left the retreat, she wrote: 'Of course it was an accident! I would never do harm to anyone’s body on purpose, least of all my holy husband, who I adore.' She explained: 'We were simply fooling around, like children playing with their father’s samurai sword, unaware that eventually someone is bound to get hurt.' After the incident, they were given five days to leave, but they left immediately. In her letter, McNally said they were not ready to re-enter the world so were going camping on land next to the retreat 'to get our thoughts settled'. When members of the retreat searched for them, they hid in a cave. The people also left water for them, knowing they were around, but the couple fell ill and could not retrieve it, authorities said. On April 22 at 6 a.m. - six weeks after they left the retreat - McNally sent a distress signal to Diamond Mountain from a transmitter she had been carrying. When caretakers could not find the couple, they called 911. A search-and-rescue team from the Cochise County Sheriff’s Office found Thorson had died from dehydration and exposure, and his wife was weak and delerious. Three of Diamond Mountain’s caretakers set out to look for her and Mr. Thorson, but could not find them. Around 8 a.m., the caretakers called 911. The retreat will end on April 3, 2014. Of its original 39 participants, 34 remain.","New investigation claims that Buddhist monk Michael Roach is engaged in bizarre sexual rituals at his Arizona yoga retreat .

Families with stay-at-home mothers in Britain face a higher tax burden than those in the rest of the Western world, a study has found. A one-earner family on the average wage that tries to raise their income through longer working hours or promotion will pay extra taxes at more than double the rate of those in other developed countries. According to the analysis by tax experts at the charity CARE, a family here living on a single salary of £27,000 can keep only 27p of every pound that they earn above that. Penalised: Tax experts at CARE have said that the system is unfair on mothers who do not work . They lose 73p through income tax and national insurance as well as the loss of tax credits, which are taken away as families earn more. An average one-earner family on £27,000 across the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (a club of the world’s 34 richest countries), would keep 66p of every extra pound earned. The charity said the discrepancy is an unfair penalty on families with stay-at-home mothers here. It comes at a time of growing protest from pressure groups speaking up for mothers who choose to bring up their children rather than pursue careers. Ministers continue to press for mothers of young children to return to work, and hope to encourage them further with new childcare subsidies next year. Protests: Many pressure groups have begun to speak up at women who would rather raise their children than pursue careers . However, a Government survey in January showed that more than a third of working mothers would prefer to give up their jobs and stay at home, while almost six out of ten would cut down their hours to spend more time at home if they could afford it. The CARE report – Taxation of Families, International Comparisons 2012 – said there was ‘discrimination against one-earner families on the average wage. 'This discrimination creates a significant tax burden gap between one-earner and dual-earner couple families that is greater than in the OECD or the EU’. A one-earner family in Britain pays 80 per cent of the tax a single person must pay, compared to 55 per cent across the OECD. And the report said the problem was getting worse – the extra taxes have gone up by 6 per cent for one-earner families compared to single people since 2011. CARE chief executive Nola Leach said: ‘It is scandalous that we get agitated about 50 per cent tax rates for the rich when we are in fact placing the highest effective marginal tax rates on low to modest income one-earner families seeking to improve their circumstances.’ A tax break for married couples is to be introduced next year, which will allow a husband or wife to transfer £1,000 of tax-free allowance to their spouse. However, it will only be worth £200 to the less well-off.","Study shows that one-earner families find it harder to bring in extra income .

The daughter of Australian 'crocodile hunter' Steve Irwin,  who died in 2006 from a stingray barb continued: 'That’s why I’m thrilled to be empowering kids.' But her comments immediately sparked a public backlash - Orlando based SeaWorld Entertainment Inc has been dogged by controversy ever since the award-winning film documentary Blackfish, was released last year. The film looked into the treatment of killer whales at the company’s theme parks.

A PE teacher who saved a pupilâ€™s life during a job interview was left disappointed when she was still turned down for the job. Emma Denham, aged in her twenties, was taking a class at Mountbatten School in Hampshire as part of the interview when a 16-year-old boy collapsed from a heart attack. She gave him CPR and was one of four staff who restarted his heart with a defibrillator. 'Miracle': Sam Mangoro, 16, was saved by Emma Denham's swift action during her job interview at his school . Despite paramedics confirming that it was the fast action of teachers that saved the pupil, the school has declined to say why Miss Denham was not offered the job. They had to shock him four times before his heart restarted, as his friends waited anxiously nearby. The schoolboy was rushed to Southampton General Hospital by ambulance, where he was placed in an induced coma. Doctors praised the teachers for their courage and ability to remain calm under pressure, saying it was their quick-thinking that saved his life. Sam is today being slowly woken from a medically induced coma, which he has been in since the incident on Thursday afternoon. His dad Michael, from Romsey, said: 'We would like to thank every single member of staff from the school from the bottom of our hearts. 'They have given us our son back, because without them we wouldn't have him. We are quietly optimistic. Miss Denham gave him CPR and joined four other teachers to get him to a defibrilator during a sports lesson . Sam's parents, Michael and Wendy, praised Miss Denham for saving their son's life . 'The critical thing was the treatment he received at the school from the teachers. 'It was absolutely incredible and that's given him every fighting chance.' He added: 'They did an absolutely . amazing and wonderful thing under immense pressure - and I in what must . have been a lot of fear.' Miss . Denham was being observed by teacher Jon Neale and deputy head Joanna . Scott as she took the class as part of a job interview. The children had only just warmed up and were a few minutes into the lesson when Sam stopped breathing and collapsed. Headteacher Heather McIlroy has now ordered two more defibrilators for the school in Hampshire . Mrs Scott said: 'Everything seemed to be in slow motion but we did everything we possibly could.'The other children were amazing and were so sensible, all leaving the gym so we could work on Sam. 'We are all still very emotional about it, but at the time you don't think - autopilot sets in and you get on with what you need to do. 'It is overwhelming to think about what we did. Every single school needs a defibrillator.' Sam's parents, Michael and Lynda, who have three younger sons, have been holding a bedside vigil. But they took a short break to visit the school on Friday to thank all of the staff who kept their son alive. Mr Mangoro added: 'We wanted to show them our gratitude. 'We will never be able to repay them for what they have done, they have been amazing because they are not medical professionals, yet they did this. We are thankful that luck was on his side on that day. 'Had he being walking home from school alone, or if the school hadn't had a defibrillator it could have been a lot different.' Sam, a bright pupil who is studying for his GCSEs, was left fighting for life aged ten when a virus damaged his heart. It left him needing medication for the rest of his life, and his parents were warned he would need a heart transplant by the time he was ten. But Sam proved them wrong and this is the first time his condition has caused him to suffer a cardiac arrest. Councillor Peter Edgar, head of education at Hampshire County Council, said: 'I wish Sam a safe and successful recovery. 'The school should be congratulated for the action they took during what must have been very traumatic circumstances.'","Emma Denham was leading class when Sam Mangoro, 16, collapsed .

Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy, was captured in 1941 while flying to Scotland on a peace mission. Until now it was thought he acted alone . It is more than 70 years since Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess, parachuted into Scotland on an ill-fated peace mission to Britain which was thought to be a solo venture made without the Nazis' knowledge. But now the discovery of a blocked oil pipe on the remains of his crashed aircraft suggest that he must have had help from inside Germany. While examining the remains of Hess's Messerschmitt at the Imperial War Museum in Cambridge, authors John Harris and Richard Wilbourn found that a crucial pipe had been blanked off with a large brass nut. They say that with only the main oil tank available Hess would not have been able to make the five-hour flight from Augsburg in Bavaria to Scotland and would have been forced to land in northern Germany to refuel. In their new book on Hess, the authors say this means other people would have to have known about the flight and assisted Hess in keeping the plane on track. Speaking to the Sunday Express, Mr Harris said: 'Our recent discoveries have essentially destroyed the illusion of a solo flight by the deputy Fuhrer who was trying to regain his former prestige. 'Our new work clearly demonstrates that the flight was planned in minute detail and required official support and connivance.' Hess parachuted out of the plane, which eventually crashed near Glasgow and was preserved . New examination of the wreckage suggests Hess would have been forced to refuel in northern Germany during his flight, meaning officials must have known what he was doing . Hess was captured by the Allies in 1941 after he was discovered flying low over Scotland to see the Duke of Hamilton - a man he had never met - who he hoped would persuade Britain to the negotiating table. Hess, Hitler's right-hand man, had seen his influence over the Fuhrer wain since the Nazi party's rise to power and the mission was seen as a desperate attempt to win back favour. After his capture Hitler disowned him, abolishing the position of deputy and promoting Hess's rival Martin Bormann to the new post of Party Chancellery. Authors John Harris and Richard Wilbourn made the discovery while examining the remains of Hess's Messerschmitt at the Imperial war Museum in Cambridge . Hess remained behind bars in Britain for the remainder of the war, and was among the first to be tried at Nuremberg following the end of the fighting. He was jailed for life in 1946 and held at Spandau Prison in Berlin until he hanged himself in 1987 at the age of 92.","Rudolf Hess parachuted into Scotland in 1941 on a peace mission .

The bees set upon the man before turning their wrath on the elderly woman. Fire firefighters who attended the scene also needed to be hospitalized, according to The Press-Enterprise. Swarm of thousands: This image, posted on YouTube by Lance Davis' Killer Bee Custom Bee Removal, shows the top of the Verizon underground vault in Palm Desert where an estimated 80,000 were found .

Stay away: Experts warn anyone dealing with a bee issue should not try and remove them and instead call in professionals . All returned to duty after treatment, officials said. The woman is believed to have suffered 1,000 stings. Davis said the bees were likely attracted to the underground vault because they were unlikely to be disturbed and because it was cool. Bees also like attics and walls for those reasons, Davis said. He removed the bees first by blowing smoke into the hive. The smoke confuses the pheromones, a secreted chemical that sends a signal to other bees to attack en masse. Davis was then able to vacuum up the bees. He them took them to his hive in Thermal and later gave them to farmers for crop pollination. Davis said anyone dealing with a similar situation should never try to kill or remove the bees themselves and to call in experts.","Attack occurred inside a gated community in Desert Springs, California, around 4.40pm Thursday .

The head of the white supremacist Aryan Brotherhood of Texas has pleaded guilty to a racketeering conspiracy that included murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking. Larry Max Bryan, 52, who goes by the name 'Slick' pleaded guilty on Friday before U.S. District Judge Sim Lake in Houston. Under federal law, Bryan could be sentenced to up to life in prison. The plea agreement calls for prosecutors to recommend the 52-year-old be sentenced to no more than 25. Sentencing is set for Oct. 7. Always an Inmate: Larry Max Bryan (pictured left and right) has only spent 5 years of his adult life out of prison and pleaded guilty on Friday to a racketeering conspiracy that included murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking . Bryan was among nearly three dozen people allegedly affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood who were charged in a sweeping indictment unsealed in 2012. Dozens of defendants have been convicted in an ongoing federal investigation of the military-style gang founded in Texas prisons in the 1980s to offer protection to white inmates. According to The Houston Chronicle, Bryan will probably need to serve his prison sentence far from the Texas State prison system where he became the head of a gang of prisoners. Bryan has been in prison for all but 5 years of his adult life. While the Aryan Brotherhood is a gang, authorities have said that they are absolutely nothing like the mafia. Malcolm Bales, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas, said it is unfair to compare the brotherhood to the Mafia – because they are so dysfunctional. Steven Cook (pictured) is thought to have been the most ruthless of Brotherhood leaders and was jailed after his own wife testified against him . ‘What we noticed is that they tend to beat up on each other a lot,’ he told Chron.com back in 2012. ‘We continue to get information about people who have disappeared, and the level of violence associated with their organization is something that we cannot tolerate. ‘I don't compare them to the Mafia. They are too weird and dysfunctional in how they handle their lives - heavy drug use and sociopathic personalities.’ The code among the brothers – inspired by their Christian beliefs – is one of ‘God forgives, brothers don’t'. Texan authorities were able to finally dismantle the leadership of the Aryan Brotherhood in 2012. 34 members of the white supremacist group have been prosecuted for federal crimes and another 30 are locked up inside state prisons, Chron.com reported. Terry Sillers . Frank Rock Jr. Carl Carver . An 80-person taskforce, led by Army Reserve lieutenant colonel Richard Boehning, spent years tracking the group down. The five divisions of the brotherhood all operated in separate ways according to the quirks and personalities of their general. But all are fiercely loyal to one another – and addicted to meth, Texas Department of Public Safety agent Brandon Bess discovered when he interviewed them. One of the leaders Steven Cooke who was reviled as one of the most controlling leaders, demanded that a group of 12 to stand round one of their members in a circle and open fire on them. He had dishonoured the group by stealing an officer’s girlfriend, a gun and drugs. Cooke was eventually jailed after his own wife testified against him. Another one of the leaders, Terry Sillers, was caught on his Harley Davidson after a police chase. General Frank Roch Jr died last year aged 59 after apparently suffering a heart attack inside a parked truck. Another one of the generals, Carl Carver, was locked up after ordering a hit. A gang member and his girlfriend were shot in the head from close range after being lured into the countryside. Carver was locked up for life after admitting racketeering and violence charges.","Larry Max Bryan, 52, who goes by the name 'Slick' pleaded guilty on Friday before U.S. District Judge Sim Lake in Houston .

Two black teens were suspended from their Missisippi high school for the rest of the year after inadvertently making gang signs in a photo during science class. On the last Friday in January, Olive Branch High School students Dontadrian Bruce, 15, and Desmond Davis, 16, were photographed by their science teacher as they were working on a project about DNA. In the pictures, the two men smile while holding up their thumb, index and middle finger, with their palms facing outward. No tolerance: Olive Branch High School student Dontadrian Bruce, 15, was pictured using a gang symbol at school at the end of January and was initially suspended along with another teen for the rest of the year . Didn't know: Dontadrian's friend Desmond Davis was also suspended for throwing up the gang symbol, but he says he didn't know it was a gang affiliation and was just in tribute to his older brother's football number (Dontadrian and Desmond are not related) The following Monday morning, both boys found themselves in the assistant principal's office. 'You’re suspended because you’re holding up gang signs in this picture,' Assistant Principal Todd Nichols said according to Dontadrian. 'You're a gangbanger.' And Dontadrian believes the school administration prejudiced their decision based on his race. 'They figured I was a gang member because of my color,' he told NBC News. Dontadrian says he was holding up the sign because three is his football jersey number while Demond says he was doing it in tribute to his older brother - whose football jersey is also the same number. Little did they know, the gesture is also a symbol of the Vice Lords, a Chicago-based gang which has a strong presence in nearby Memphis, Tennessee. Dontadrian's mom Janet Hightower was surprised when she was called to the school over the incident with her A- and B-average son. Olive Branch High School administrators eventually reversed their decision to suspend the two boys in the wake of outrage online . 'He's a good child,' Ms Hightower said. 'I know what he does 24 hours a day. If he leaves home and goes two houses down, he's gonna text me and let me know.' Dontadrian says he tried to argue his case, but 'it was like they didn't even care'. Three days later Dontadrian was called to a disciplinary hearing where he was informed that he would not be allowed back at school until the next year. Desmond's parents were equally as upset to hear about their son's suspension. 'I thought it was crazy,' Desmond's father Van Davis said. 'When does he have time to be in a gang? He barely goes outside, he goes to school, church and back home.' Word spread fast of the boys' dismissal, and many in the community were outraged with one person starting a Facebook support group for Dontadrian  which quickly garnered over 2,000 'likes'. Desmond's older brother Dontavius Bruce got suspended as well after having friends in one of his classes pose with the sign to show support. Making a statement: Desmond's older brother Dontavius got suspended as well after he had an entire class pose with the symbol to support his little brother . The school district defended its decision initially, saying gang symbols are against school rules as spelled out in the student handbook. 'Safety is our number one priority,' DeSoto County Schools Spokeswoman Katherine Nelson said in a statement, 'Gangs are a serious threat to our schools.' But after the story swept the internet, the school was forced to reverse its decision and now both men are back after missing over 15 days of class. DeSoto Schools superintendent Van Alexander says they may be looking into changing school policy about gang paraphernalia starting next year. 'We’re looking at possible revisions for the upcoming school year,' said Alexander. 'But safety still has to be the number one priority. It just has to be.'","Dontadrian Bruce, 15, and Desmond Davis, 16, were suspended from school for the rest of the year last month .

A controversial new bill proposed by a Californian politician could mark the end of popular Shamu shows at SeaWorld. If passed, the bill would be the most comprehensive protection law for orcas held in captive, in the U.S. for more than 40 years, according to the man behind the proposed legislation. State Assembly member Richard Bloom, will introduce the Orca Welfare and Safety Act today. In one of the most tragic incidents involving killer whales at Sea World, Dawn Brancheau (pictured) died after being grabbed by an orca . The bill would make it illegal to 'hold in captivity, or use, a wild-caught or captive-bred orca for performance or entertainment purposes'. The proposed bill would also ban the artificial insemination of captive killer whales in the state of California and block the import of orcas or orca semen from other states. Under the rules, those violating such a law, would face a fine of up to $100,000 and/or six months in prison. In a written statement Mr Bloom said: 'There is no justification for the continued captive display of orcas for entertainment purposes. 'These beautiful creatures are much too large and far too intelligent to be confined in small, concrete pens for their entire lives. It is time to end the practice of keeping orcas captive for human amusement.' He said under the terms of the bill, the 10 orcas in captive at SeaWorld in San Diego, would be 'rehabilitated and returned to the wild where possible'. Where that is not possible, the whales should be kept in a sea pen, that is open to the public but not used for entertainment purposes, Mr Bloom said. Under the terms of the bill orcas held for rehabilitation after being rescued or stranded, or for research purposes, would be exempt from the conditions but would be kept in a sea pen. If it becomes law, the the Orca Welfare and Safety Acl proposed by state assembly member in California Richard Bloom, would make it illegal to 'hold in captivity, or use, a wild-caught or captive-bred orca for performance or entertainment purposes' In 1992 South Carolina passed a bill to outlaw the captivity of killer whales, dolphins and porpoises, to stop a proposed dolphin park from opening in the state. Last month New York state senator Greg Ball introduced a bill to ban orca captivity. Countries including India, Croatia, Hungary, Chile and Costa Rica, have outlawed the captivity of all dolphins, whales and porpoises. Dr Naomi Rose, marine mammal scientist at the Animal Welfare Institute, said the bill was inspired by the orcas-in-captivity documentary Blackfish. 'The Blackfish effect has never been in greater evidence—everything has led to this, the first serious legislative proposal to prohibit the captive display of this highly intelligent and social species,' Dr Rose told Take Part. 'SeaWorld should join with this effort rather than continue to fight it. They can be on the right side of history.' Mr Bloom asked Dr Rose and her team at Blackfish to help with the bill. Dr Rose said while they did not initiate the proposal they helped in anyway they could, with bill language, information and gathering facts, as well as getting support from the public and scientific community.","California state assembly member Richard Bloom has proposed new bill .

Charged: Dale Cregan  has been charged over the deaths of PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone . The one-eyed man arrested over the fatal shooting of two unarmed policewomen checked into a celebrity-loved luxury spa resort while police hunted for him, it was claimed today. Dale Cregan was last night charged with four murders, including those of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes and a father and son. After he handed himself in following Tuesday’s outrage Cregan is due to appear in a Manchester court this morning. David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23, were both shot dead in separate incidents earlier this year. But before the suspect was grabbed by Greater Manchester Police after a five-week hunt, he is thought to have stayed in the plush Plas Coch resort on the island of Anglesey, north Wales. It is popular with footballers like Michael and former Liverpool and England star John Barnes. Around a month ago the police got a tip off he might be there but after staking it out for several days they failed to spot him. A week later a holidaymaker then told a hotel worker they were sure he had been there, as she had seen him splashing around happily in the luxury heated swimming pool. 'It was a woman who spotted him. I was worried about it. About a week after that another family came in and said they thought they saw him wandering around,' a source told The Sun. Police rushed back but couldn't find him, the source added. On its website Plas Coch promises 'Fun, relaxation and happy memories' and a 'place to escape the stress of daily life and rebalance your wellbeing' - all with stunning views of water and Snowdonia. Scroll down for video of Cregan arriving at court . Claim: The luxury Plas Coch resort in Anglesey where Dale Cregan is reported to have stayed while on the run . Spotted: Cregan was allegedly seen splashing in its pool by a holidaymaker but when police arrived he was gone . Cregan is also thought to have spent some time in Herne Bay, on the Kent coast, almost 300 miles from Manchester as police looked for him. Cregan was also charged with four attempted murders. PCs Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, were killed after receiving a call to investigate a burglary at a terraced house in Mottram, Manchester. When they got there, they were shot dead by a waiting gunman who then threw a hand grenade. Last night, Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for the North West, said: ‘The tragic events this week in which Police Constables Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes lost their lives in the line of duty have shocked and appalled the whole country.‘ . PC Fiona Bone (left) and PC Nicola Hughes (right) were killed while they were on duty . Charged: Cregan is accused of the murders of David Short (left) and his son Mark Short (right) ‘I have today authorised the police to charge 29-year-old Dale Cregan with their murders and with the murders of Mark Short, who was killed at the Cotton Tree Inn in Droylsden on 25 May, and David Short, who was killed at his home in Clayton on 10 August. ‘Cregan has also been charged with the attempted murders of Michael Belcher, Ryan Pridding and John Short on 25 May and Sharon Hark on 10 August.’ Cregan is set to appear in custody at Manchester magistrates’ court this morning. The wave of murders that swept across Manchester are thought to be the result of a bitter family feud. PCs Hughes and Bone were the innocent victims of the deadly rivalry. It is believed the feud stems from a . vicious fight for control of low-level organised crime in east . Manchester and centres around the control of the ‘doors’ in pubs and . clubs, protection rackets and the trade in cannabis. It is thought it may have initially been sparked by an alleged assault on a woman. But the dispute spilled over into bloodshed when Mark Short was gunned down in the Cotton Tree Inn. It is understood the gunman had intended to ‘kneecap’ him as he played pool but Short bent down and was blasted in the neck. Heartbroken: The police force and the community have been devastated by the deaths of the two young policewomen, who were on duty when they died . United in grief: Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police Sir Peter Fahy (second from left) and other senior officers carry floral tributes to the scene where PC's Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone died .

David Short vowed to take revenge and threatened to murder relatives of his son’s killer in retaliation. He was later murdered in front of his house by a gunman armed with a semi-automatic pistol and grenades. Sources say the feud stems from . bitter rivalry between the Short and Wilkinson families. Anthony . Wilkinson, 33, is currently in custody awaiting trial, charged with the . murder of David Short. Since the shooting of David Short in . August, several members of both families have received Osman warnings – . official tip-offs from the police that their lives are in danger.

The condition is painless and its onset insidious. Indeed, many of the 500,000 Britons with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) might not have noticed it for some time – simply needing a brighter light to read by, colours seeming less vibrant and faces harder to recognise. But for one in ten the problem can worsen suddenly and, without swift intervention, permanent sight loss occurs. Now sufferers have been thrown a lifeline. A new injectable drug has become available on the NHS which may help those who haven’t responded to the current treatment regime. It  also promises to halve the number of jabs required. The macula is the centre part of the retina (the photographic film at the back of the eye), which changes the light focused on to it into electrical messages to the brain to give us high-definition colour vision. There are two types of AMD: dry, which is where the cells of the macula die off very gradually, about which nothing can currently be done, and wet, which is where abnormal blood vessels leak fluid into the macula. If left unchecked, it is this leaking process that can lead to sudden blindness. The causes of AMD remain unknown. If people have dry macular degeneration, ten to 15 per cent will go on to have wet AMD. Other risk factors are smoking and having a family member who has had it. The new drug, Eylea, which was approved for NHS use this year, is an anti-VEGF drug that works by blocking the production of a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the cells in the eye. Eylea also contains a substance called anti-PIGF (placental growth factor), which appears to further delay the leakage from abnormal blood vessels compared with the other drugs used for the condition – Lucentis and Avastin. Linda Newton’s right eye has improved significantly since she began treatment with Eylea last year. ‘I was diagnosed with wet AMD when  I was 59, which was a horrible shock,’ says Linda, a retired teacher and bookkeeper from Bradford. ‘I’ve worn glasses throughout my life and noticed that the vision in the right eye was getting blurry. I went to my GP, who referred me to an ophthalmologist. ‘When I was told I could lose my sight, I was devastated. At that stage I was told I needed immediate injections  of Lucentis to prevent my vision deteriorating further.’ New drug: Eylea, which was approved for NHS use this year, is an anti-VEGF drug that works by blocking the production of a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the cells in the eye . Any drug for wet AMD is administered by injection directly into the eyeball. The eye is first anaesthetised with drops, before a very fine needle injects the drug into the central part of the eye, which is filled with a viscous thick clear liquid, the vitreous humour. Treatment is painless, and takes minutes. Patients then administer antibiotic eye drops for a few more days after the injection to reduce the risk of infection. ‘It was daunting at first to have the Lucentis treatment but I soon got used  to it,’ explains Linda, 66. ‘The treatment helped so I continued with it for ten injections, which my medical insurance covered. My husband and I had to find the money for another three monthly shots privately [£1,700 per injection] before, fortunately, the NHS funding was approved for the rest of my care.’ Linda went on having the injections at roughly four to six-week intervals until May this year, when her consultant  suggested Eylea. ‘I had my first injection of Eylea in  May, then two more at monthly intervals,’ says Linda. ‘As the back of my right eye remained dry, injection times have been extended from first six weeks, then eight weeks, then ten weeks. ‘I’m due to have my next jab in February, when it will be 12 weeks between injections. Although I don’t mind injections, it is great that I don’t have to go as often for treatment.’ Helen Devonport, consultant in ophthalmology at Bradford Royal Infirmary, says: ‘With Lucentis treatments, patients have to come in to clinic every four weeks. With Eylea, if we only have to see patients and treat them every eight weeks, then that should reduce pressure on clinics significantly, and save on time costings as well as the price of the actual drugs used. So it should be beneficial in a wider capacity to the NHS.’ Peter Simcock, consultant eye surgeon from the Royal Devon and Exeter Foundation Trust, who is pioneering the training of nurse practitioners to deliver injections, says: ‘Treatment by both drugs results in stable vision in two-thirds of patients and improved vision in about  one third. The cost of treating this condition with both drugs remains high but there may be fewer injections needed with Eylea. Both drugs produce good outcomes for patients, so the future is looking brighter for AMD sufferers.’ macularsociety.org .","Nearly 500,000 Britons have age-related macular degeneration (AMD)

Head to head: Actor Matthew Perry clashed with writer Peter Hitchens over the treatment of drug addicts in a debate on Newsnight . Peter baited the Friends star, a . self-confessed addict, by saying the whole debate was pointless as . addiction itself is a fiction – it’s a view he has often aired, and . presumably the reason he was invited on the show. Matthew, who played Chandler  in the TV show but has reinvented himself as an ambassador for addiction recovery, having managed it himself, obviously didn’t agree. In fact, he seemed completely floored by Peter’s curveball, and claimed addiction was an ‘allergy’, which is just completely wrong,  and an ‘obsession’. The whole thing descended into name-calling and I was left yelling coherent answers on his behalf at the TV. Peter claims that addiction is simply an excuse for lack of willpower, and ‘no more real than Tinkerbell’. Is he right? Well, yes and no. Addiction is a common problem not limited to Hollywood stars. There is a seedy side. But a huge number of those who are dependent on alcohol, cigarettes or tablets (often, first prescribed to control another illness) are ordinary Britons who don’t know they can’t stop until they try. One thing on many minds in January will be giving up smoking. Many others will be shocked to find forgoing their evening couple of glasses  of wine for the January ‘dryathlon’ impossible, and may be compelled to seek help with their drinking. Battle: The debate between the ex-drug addict Friends star and the columnist heated up when Hitchens said addiction is 'no more real than Tinkerbell' I commonly see cancer patients who are addicted to their prescription pain drugs or sleeping pills – drugs that they’d never have chosen to take if it wasn’t for their illness. And thousands more are dependent on over-the-counter pain medication containing codeine. We need to stop debating whether people need to just ‘pull themselves together’, and start looking at finding better psychological support, which is proven to work, because addiction can wreck physical health and emotional wellbeing, and tear families apart. During the debate, Peter asked a clever question: he challenged Matthew to provide evidence of an ‘objective diagnosis’, which I think means a blood test or scan that would prove a person is addicted to something. As well he knows, there is no such thing. But we don’t have a test or scan that proves the existence of many long-term illnesses – I could reel  off a long list, but let’s just focus for  the moment on Parkinson’s disease. Like many illnesses, there is no quantifiable chemical or test one can use to ‘prove’ the diagnosis. That doesn’t mean Parkinson’s is ‘imagined’. It just means we don’t yet know enough about the brain and nervous system to pinpoint a physical sign. But we do know a bit about the neurological processes that drive both addiction and Parkinson’s. Research . at the University of California has shown through brain imaging that . even after one or two doses of cocaine, mice develop brand new . neurological pathways. These pathways lead the mice to pursue more . cocaine, even though it jeopardises their usual feeding and drinking . routine: just like a human addict prioritising drug-seeking behaviour . over everything else. Debate: Last week's Mail On Sunday . Whether or not these animals have willpower, no one knows. But the research does suggest something physical happens in the brains of those who are addicted. In human studies, scans have shown that areas in the brains of addicts ‘light up’ when they are exposed to the object of their desire. Numerous studies have shown a rise in the brain chemical dopamine which occurs in response to addictive vices, whether gambling or drugs. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, a naturally occurring chemical produced by the brain that sends messages between nerve cells and signals pleasure. Evolutionary neuroscience suggests that this compound is intrinsic to our ability to learn – it acts like a ‘save button’ and helps us remember to do things by giving us a good feeling when we do them. Famously, the psychologist Pavlov showed that even the anticipation of pleasure can elicit a physical response: his dog salivated at the sight of food, and by Pavlov ringing a bell as he served it, eventually, his dog salivated as soon as he heard the bell, without food being present. Addiction is simply this reward process gone awry. Studies show that once people are addicted to a drug, the dopamine in their system spikes even with the expectation of ‘the hit’, and if it doesn’t come, the dopamine levels drop sharply. This feels bad. Interestingly, Parkinson’s is treated with synthetic dopamine – the chemical is also involved in co-ordinating movement. Case studies have been reported from the Mayo Clinic, where patients treated with dopamine-enhancing drugs developed a brand new gambling addiction, despite no previous addictive tendencies. This addictive behaviour halted abruptly when the drug was stopped. While case studies are not proof, this certainly adds to the body of evidence that addiction is not merely a state of mind. It seems nonsensical to say that addiction cannot be physiological because willpower is essentially the main treatment. Psychological therapies and ‘mind-over-matter’ are considered a gold-standard treatment for a multitude of conditions, including those with a very physical cause, such as back pain, and those without, like depression. Are we therefore also to conclude these conditions do not exist? Of course not. The same is true of addiction. But in my area, a patient can wait for many months for a psychotherapy referral, by which time an addict’s resolve may well have crumbled. It’s not good enough. Doctors are not in the business of deciding which of our patients are deserving and which aren’t. We are not the moral guardians of society deciding whether patients should be treated if they are smokers or over-eaters who become obese. The same is true for addiction; whether its origins are in Hollywood or somewhere far less glamorous. Addiction in my mind is like any other disease: it requires a non-judgmental medical approach and an acceptance of the problems, both physical and mental, that need attention.","Columnist Peter Hitchens clashed with Matthew Perry over drugs .

This Christmas, Skye Swinton got exactly the gift she’d dreamed of – the chance to walk unaided for the first time. The four-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, had life-changing spinal surgery paid for by Britain’s biggest lottery winners, Chris and Colin Weir. Skye was refused the treatment on the NHS, so her mother Ruth wrote to the Weirs in desperation, asking for help to pay the £40,000 cost. Skye Swinton from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, who has cerebral palsy walks for the first time unaided since having an operation funded by  Britain's biggest lottery winners . The four-year-old girl took her first steps - thanks to the generosity of Britain's biggest lottery winners,  Chris and Colin Weir . The couple generously agreed to share their £161million EuroMillions jackpot and Skye had the surgery in October – meaning she took her first steps without walking sticks just in time for Christmas. Mrs Swinton, 39, said: ‘Seeing her walking with a smile on her face is the most amazing Christmas present. Her progress has been amazing. ‘In the past she could not walk properly on her own because she could only walk on the tips of her toes. ‘Now, she can get her heels on the ground and there is no stopping her. ‘She is absolutely loving it and wants to show off how well she can walk.’ Skye, who was born 13 weeks early weighing just 1lb 15oz, has spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. Her operation, a selective dorsal rhizotomy carried out at Bristol’s Frenchay Hospital, is new to the UK, but has been performed in the States for years.

Skye was refused the treatment on the NHS, so her mother Ruth (right) wrote to the Weirs in desperation, asking for help to pay the £40,000 cost . It involves partially cutting nerves where they join the spinal cord, in order to loosen the muscles. Without it she would have remained confined to a wheelchair, and would have needed major corrective surgery in a few years. Mr and Mrs Weir, of North Ayrshire, Scotland, became Britain’s biggest single jackpot winners in 2011. They paid £28,000 towards the surgery after the Swinton family raised £12,000. Mrs Swinton, a full-time carer for Skye who lives in Cheltenham with her husband John, said: ‘This will make a huge difference to Skye’s life. ‘In time, she will be able to take part in all the activities her peers are.’ In a statement, Mr and Mrs Weir said they hoped the donation would ease the family’s worries. They said: ‘Skye faces many challenges in the next year. 'Without the additional worry and pressure of fundraising, their time can be spent on Skye.’","Skye Swinton was refused spinal surgery treatment on the NHS .

'Spurious science': Gary Bolton, 47, seen outside court today, sold his fake bomb detectors to clients for use by soldiers and police and customs officers . A businessman who sold 'useless' bomb detectors to international clients for thousands of pounds has been jailed for seven years. Gary Bolton, 47, of Chatham in Kent, sold the fake devices to for up to £10,000 each, boasting that they could detect explosives, narcotics, ivory, tobacco and even money. But a judge at the Old Bailey today described the equipment as 'useless' and 'dross'. Tests revealed the devices - which Bolton assembled at his home for less than £5 each - were no better at detection than random chance. The court heard the businessman was aware of the 'spurious science' behind his product, but continued to market and sell the devices at home and abroad through his firm Global Technical for 'enormous' profits. He denied two counts of fraud but was convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey last month. Sentencing the father-of-three today, judge Richard Hone QC said Bolton had maintained the 'little plastic box' was a piece of working equipment, and that he continued to 'peddle' it to scores of international clients - including for use by armed forces - despite evidence proving it was 'useless'. He added: 'You were determined to . bolster the illusion that the devices worked and you knew there was a . spurious science to produce that end. 'They had a random detection rate. They were useless. Scroll down for video . 'They were useless': Bolton denied two counts of fraud but was jailed for seven years today after being found guilty by a jury last month . Jailed: Bolton, seen left in a mug shot issued by City of London police today and right outside court at an earlier hearing, made 'enormous' profits 'peddling' the phoney bomb detectors to clients around the world . 'Soldiers, police officers, customs officers and many others put their trust in a device which worked no better than random chance. 'The jury found you knew this but you carried on. Your profits were enormous.' The court was told Bolton’s company, Global Technical in Ashford, had a turnover of almost £3 million, with up to 5,000 devices made. Bulk orders meant the GT200 was sold for between £2,500 and £10,000, although they retailed at up to £15,000 if bought individually, the court was told. Fake: One of the devices Bolton sold through his Ashford firm Global Technical, which had a turnover of nearly £3million, the court heard . Around 1,200 devices were sold to Mexico, while orders were also shipped to parts of Asia and the Middle East. The devices are still being used in Thailand, the court heard. Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting, previously said the devices were relatively cheap to make. Corruption probe: Bolton, seen outside an earlier hearing, is a father-of-three from Chatham in Kent . He told the trial: 'In fact, the device, you may think, was nothing more than a box with a handle and antennae attached to it and pieces of plastic inside it. 'Bolton knew these devices did not work but he made and supplied them so that they could be sold.' The prosecutor said Bolton admitted in interview to having no background in science, research, training or security, the court heard. Members of the jury were told Bolton claimed the devices worked with a range of 766 yards (700m) at ground level and as far as 2.5 miles (4km) in the air - although a Home Office defence expert said it had 'no credibility as an explosive detector'. Bolton was arrested in June 2010 following an investigation by City of London Police’s overseas corruption unit. Detective Inspector Roger Cook said: 'Gary Bolton made a fortune selling devices that were supposed to be able to detect explosives and other harmful substances but in reality were nothing more than plastic handles with aerials as antennae. 'In doing so he was putting people’s lives and livelihoods at serious risk, but his sole consideration was how much money he could make. 'Bringing Bolton to justice is the result of a long, complex and far reaching international investigation and his seven-year prison sentence should act as a warning to others who seek to act corruptly overseas with the belief that they will go undetected.' Bolton’s sentence came after fellow conman James McCormick was jailed for 10 years earlier this year for three counts of fraud from selling fake bomb detectors. McCormick, 57, of Langport in Somerset, was said to have made £50 million from his scam. Representing Bolton, Jonathan Higgs QC told the court that his client’s offending - between 2007 and 2012 - was not on the same level as McCormick’s. He said: 'There is no suggestion that these devices were to be sold to and deployed as frontline devices to counter terrorist threat. Trial: Bolton assembled the 'little plastic boxes' at his home at a cost of £5, before 'peddling' them to clients around the globe . 'Dross': The boxes' detection rate was no better than random chance, the Old Bailey heard . 'The countries to which tenders were made were using these devices for a range of different detections.' He added: 'This is a device which was sold honestly to start with.' But the judge said he did not accept that suggestion, also questioning the validity of a psychiatric report which said Bolton was believed to have 'a depressive illness'. Global firm: His multi-million pound firm shipped devices to Mexico, parts of Asia and the Middle East . Bolton, wearing a grey polo shirt, black trousers and canvas-style shoes, closed his eyes as his sentence was read out. The judge said: 'You have damaged the reputation of British trade abroad. 'You gave spurious credibility to this product. 'You’re a fraudulent person. You have no remorse.' A confiscation hearing is due to be held next year.","Gary Bolton, 47, of Chatham, Kent convicted after a trial at Old Bailey .

A blind Paralympian athlete who has won three gold medals issued a tearful apology today after he was caught fraudulently claiming £10,000 for taxi rides he didn't make. Simon Jackson, 40, an MBE and Britain's most decorated judo star, took the money claiming he needed it to pay for cab fares to work. But inspectors from the Department of Work and Pensions exposed Jackson after they saw his wife Sarah, 29, driving him to a school where he is employed as a student learning mentor for Rochdale Council, in Greater Manchester. Triple gold medal winning Paralympian star Simon Jackson, with wife Sarah Jackson (right) and mother Sandra Jackson (left), was caught fraudulently claiming £10,000 for taxi rides he didn't make . Jackson, who won gold at three Paralympics between 1988 and 1996, admitted benefit fraud after DWP inspectors spotted his wife driving him to the school where he worked . Inquiries revealed there was no record of the visually impaired athlete - who won Paralympic gold at Seoul '88, Barcelona '92 and Atlanta '96 - using taxis under the Government's Access to Work payment during a ten month period. Jackson, from Littleborough, near Oldham, who admitted benefit fraud, escaped jail after insisting he was 'ashamed' of his conduct and had been subjected to abuse following his exposure. Representing himself, he told Manchester magistrates he is now fighting to keep his job at the school, in Rochdale, and still wants to teach judo to children. His wife Sarah and mother Sandra, both judo coaches, watched from the public gallery as Jackson said: 'Throughout my life I have tried to do everything by the book and I shouldn't have done what I did. 'I get up each morning and enjoy my job and try to make a difference with children that I work with. I have had abuse and my mums house has been vandalised - even though I don't even live with her. 'I have not been out that much and feel ashamed of what I have done. I don't want one mistake I have made affect the rest of my life. Jackson received an MBE for his services to judo in 2007 but, following an injury, retired from the sport in 2008 and took up indoor tandem cycling . 'I love to have something to get up to in the morning. Before this I was a valued member of society. After this has finished I want to start to rebuild my life again.' Jackson took up judo at the age of seven and, despite his visual impairment, soon began to compete on an equal level with sighted children. At the age of 15 he competed in his first European Championship in Paris where he won the first of 16 European gold medals. His paralympic medal was won at just 16 - and three world championship gold medals made him Great Britain's most successful judo player of all time. Jackson told the court he had been a valued member of society and wanted to rebuild his life . He received the MBE for his services to the sport in 2007 but following an injury, he retired from judo in 2008 only to take up indoor tandem cycling and in the 2008 Paralympic World Cup he won two silver medals. Prosecuting Paul Darnborough said the fraud offences occurred between September 2010 and July 2011 after Jackson claimed access to work support. 'He is registered blind and he is unable to travel to work,' said Mr Darnborough. 'He got this benefit, the access to work payment, which was put directly into his building society. Jackson told the court he was fighting to keep his job at the school in Rochdale and still wanted to teach judo to children . 'A taxi took him to his place of work and from work and he had to supply these receipts to them. 'A review took place in February 2011 that suggests that the information was not commensurate to that of the claim form and the department started an investigation. 'He was surveyed in July 2011 for a couple of weeks and during that short time Jackson seemed to be driven to work by his wife. 'Between July 7 and 15 he was seen to be driven on seven occasions. He was driven to work by his wife and rendering false receipts from the taxi company.' Jackson claimed between £15 and £27 for each journey. He initially insisted he had been collected every day by the same taxi driver but later confessed after he was confronted with the fact there was no record of his bookings at the cab firm. He took a total of £10,890 but has since paid it back. Jackson was ordered to complete a four month community order and abide by a 7pm to 6am curfew. The curfew will be relaxed every Tuesday to start at 10pm so he can carry on teaching judo to youngsters. He must pay court costs of £250. Passing sentence JP Stephen Ingram told Jackson: 'You should be an example to your pupils and to all those around you. You are a role model to young people. 'You have let yourself down and you will have this stigma around you for long after what happens in this court room.' The government grant is to help disabled people buy specialist equipment, travel to work or pay for a communicator at a job interview.","Simon Jackson was caught fraudulently claiming more than £10,000 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:47 EST, 22 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:00 EST, 22 October 2013 . Explosive court papers reveal how Farrah Fawcett had an 11-year relationship with her college sweetheart behind the back of Ryan O’Neal up until her death. A court battle over the ownership of an Andy Warhol portrait of the Charlie's Angel star have led to the revelation of intimate stories about the relationship that Fawcett was having with her college boyfriend while she was still seen in public with her longtime partner, Ryan O'Neal. Former college football star Greg Lott was called to give a deposition in the lawsuit, saying that he was having a sexual relationship with the famous actress- who he called his 'girlfriend'- until she died from cancer in 2009. Lott, a former football player, detailed their 'committed relationship' in the lengthy deposition, saying that they were 'exclusive' in spite of reports that she was romantically involved with the O'Neal at that time. Secret lovers: Greg Lott claims that he was 'with' Farrah Fawcett in the last 11 years of her life and they were exclusive in their romantic relationship and now he has detailed their time in a deposition . Together: Fawcett's former boyfriend said that the Charlie's Angel star was no longer romantically linked to Ryan O'Neal after they formally broke up in 1997 (seen together at a party in 2004), but they clearly remained close until her death in 2009 . Fawcett and O'Neal never married but dated from 1979 until 1997, and during that time they raised their son Redmond together. Though they broke up more than a decade before her battle with cancer, O'Neal was a constant presence in Fawcett's life and has been heading up the dispute over the ownership of a Warhol portrait of Fawcett ever since. Lott said that he and Fawcett had 'a sexual relationship' during the last decade of her life, and he was the only man in that capacity at that time. 'She saw no one else and I saw no one else but her,' Lott said in the deposition, according to Radar Online. He went on to say that Fawcett rarely spoke with O'Neal while she was with Lott, with one point of exception. 'Yes, except for (their contact regarding) a dysfunctional son… He’s a drug addict,' Lott said of Redmond O'Neal. His side: Lott says that Fawcett stayed close to O'Neal because of their son but he was the one having a relationship with her at the time of her death in 2009 . Proof: Lott has offered this 2007-dated letter from Farrah as evidence of their relationship . Redmond has struggled with substance abuse and was temporarily released from jail in 2009 to visit his mother in shackles at the hospital and also was permitted to attend Farrah's funeral after she died of cancer at age 62. 'My understanding is he (Ryan O'Neal) claims that he was with her for 30 years. That discounts my 11-year relationship with her,' Lott said in the deposition. Lott said that while O'Neal and Fawcett were photographed together as they 'would pick up her son at the gym or drop him off at the gym', Lott and Fawcett kept their public appearances to a minimum when they were together. He said that they went to the movies a handful of times but other than that they wanted to avoid the glare of the public eye. Lott explained the reasons saying: 'One was her child and the rest of it was because I didn’t want to be Mr. Fawcett in the media. We were famous together in college. We did not want to go through that again.' Family unit: Ryan and Farrah were a couple from 1979 until 1997 and they raised their son Redmond together, but they remained close as all three are pictured at a premiere in 2003 . Better times: Fawcett and O'Neal were seen as an unusual Hollywood couple in that they lasted for nearly two decades but never married . This isn't the first time that Lott has spoken publicly about his relationship with the star of Charlie's Angels. Lott previously told The Mail On Sunday that he first met Farrah in the Sixties when she was, he says, ‘like a frisky palomino – all legs, teeth and spirit’. The truth, he says, is that for the last 11 years of her life, Farrah was involved in a very private romance with him. ‘We were blind, crazy, in love,’ he says. ‘Farrah was my best friend and my inspiration. 'We fell in love with each other all those years ago and we never really stopped loving each other. Our lives took us in very different directions but, in the end, her heart always came home to me and Texas.’ In a series of startling revelations made to our newspaper, Lott claims that O’Neal froze him out of Farrah’s life against her will and that she referred to O’Neal as the ‘Fat F*** from the beach’. Men left standing: Redmond (seen left with his father earlier this month) has been sober ever since leaving prison following a drug arrest. He was allowed to attend his mother's funeral in 2009 mid-sentence . Perhaps predictably, his claims have been greeted with anger by Ryan O’Neal, whose spokesman says they are ‘categorically false’. Causing a stir: The deposition was given in relation to a lawsuit over an Andy Warhol silk screen of Fawcett that O'Neal is trying to take ownership of. This is a polaroid Warhol did in connection to that project . However, Ryan’s son Griffin from a . different relationship says: ‘I have to thank Greg Lott for one thing: . For loving Farrah the way she deserved to be loved. Ryan was just there . for the acclaim.’ Lott says: ‘I last spoke to Farrah late on the night of April 9 – two-and-a-half months . before she died. She was preparing to come home from a bout of treatment at St John’s Hospital in Santa Monica. She told me: “I’m coming home tomorrow. I love you and I will call you.”’ But Greg never heard from her again. In desperation, he flew to California, to her home in LA, but, he claims, O’Neal refused him entry. He says: ‘I never got to say goodbye to Farrah. Ryan shut me out of her life.’ Now O’Neal is trying to make sure he gets control of one last piece of Fawcett, and this time it comes in the form of a painting. Andy Warhol made two silk screens of Fawcett in 1980 and one of the originals was bequeathed to her alma mater of the University of Texas but O’Neal claims that it belongs to him. The trial is continues.","Farrah Fawcett dated Ryan O'Neal from 1979 until 1997 but they stayed close until her death in 2009 .

The tragedy is the latest to . emerge in the wake of the storm that tore through this swathe of the mid-West and claimed the life of 24, nine of them children. A further 237 were injured and hope of finding victims alive was beginning to wane. Officials started to search flattened homes and piles of rubble with cadaver dogs. No survivors were found on Tuesday and officials said they hope to complete three searches of every site of devastation before nightfall. The weather service confirmed that the powerful storm was for times an EF5 - the maximum on the scale. Seven children were found drowned at Plaza Towers Elementary School, which was a direct hit during the 45 minutes of terror. Nine-year-old Janae Hornsby, whose father said 'always has a smile on her face', is one of the victims while family members have shared pictures of other missing children, including Sydney Angle, feared dead. Frightened third graders were . being pulled from the wreckage alive on Monday afternoon as rescue workers . passed the children down a human chain before taking them to a triage center . set up in the school's parking lot. Staff said there had been at least 75 people in the school of around 500 students when the tornado hit. The 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students were taken from the school to a church before the twister barreled through. Students who were inside . the building described clinging to the walls of the hallway where many . of them huddled during the storm as the twister battered the school.

'Our hearts are broken for the parents that are wondering about the state of their children that had been in the schools that have been hit today,' Fallin said. 'I know that there are families wondering where their loved ones are.' At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, officials said they are aiming to complete three searches of all homes by dark. Rescue teams, including 80 members of the National Guard and search dogs, had reported hearing cries for help from beneath the rubble of the flattened school but the screams reportedly stopped at around 6:30 p.m. local time. One teacher told Good Morning America that her students had to stay with her for hours until their parents could reach them. Because of the damage to the roads, 'parents walked for miles just to get to their children,' she said. 'They were out of breath and crying but just so happy to see them.' Many parents have been forced to endure an agonizing wait at St. Andrews United Methodist Church, where they wait for news of their loved ones. Rescue: Dozens of volunteers came forward to help in the bid to find survivors . Counting the cost: Families assessed their property today. Many also received the devastating news their loved ones were among the 24 confirmed dead . Frantic parents rushed to Plaza Towers Elementary moments after it was pummeled but were kept back so search teams could hear any survivors calling for help through the rubble. The seven children confirmed dead are believed to have been trapped underneath rubble when they were overcome by water from burst pipes. The families were later taken to a nearby church where they continued the harrowing wait for news. On Tuesday morning the death toll was revised down to 24 - from the prior figure of 51, which may have included some double-reported casualties. Crews used jackhammers and sledgehammers to tear . away concrete, and chunks were being thrown to the side as the workers . dug.

The parents of a Texas high school football player have filed a bullying complaint against a rival team - claiming the teen's 91-0 loss amounted to tormenting their son. To be sure, the Bearcats of Aledo High School humiliated Western Hills High School on the field Friday night. But Aledo coach Tim Buchanan says the score would have been even higher if he hadn't made his team pull its punches. Pulling punches: Aledo High School coach Tim Buchanan says the score against Western Hills High School would have been even higher if he hadn't pulled his best players . The Aledo Bearcats reached the endzone again and again during Friday night's blow-out victory over Western Hills High School . 'In actuality, we prolly could have scored a lot more if we hadn't have done the running clock and done some other things,' he told KXAS-TV. 'I was really fearful we were going to score 100.' Buchanan said he started substituting out his best players in the first quarter when it became apparent that Western Hills High wasn't playing in the same league as his team. The Aledo Bearcats are a dominating team. So far this season they are unbeaten, and have completed their games with a combined score of 485-47. Even the coach for Western Hills said he doesn't agree with the complaint. His players just met a vastly superior team. 'We just ran into a buzzsaw, you know,' Coach John Naylor told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. WATCH THE EXTENDED HIGHLIGHTS AT BEARCATSVISION . The coach of Western Hills High School says he disagrees with the complaint, adding that his players simply met a vastly better team on the field .

They . get after it, and that’s the way football is supposed to be played in . Texas.' Under Texas law, Aledo school officials must investigate the complaint with the same rigor as a report that a student is being harassed and beaten up by classmates. The complaint was made against the coaching staff through the school's website, which offers a form that can be filled out and submitted online. The parents of a Western Hills High School player filed the complaint. The student and the parents have not been named. The Texas Education Agency defines bullying this way: 'Bullying occurs when a person is exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons, and he or she has difficulty defending himself or herself. ;Bullying is aggressive behavior that involves unwanted, negative actions. Bullying involves a pattern of behavior repeated over time. Bullying involves an imbalance of power or strength.' Aledo coach Buchanan says he's never heard of the term applied to simply playing a football game. He said he regrets that the victory was so lopsided, but he said his players must still give 100percent of their effort when they take the field. 'To go out and tell your kids, ""No, I don't want you to play hard, because we're ahead,"" that's against every fundamental coaching strategy that you have,' he said.","Complaint filed against coaches of Aledo High School football team after it players mangled the Western Hills High School team on the field .

A man has taken up diving to try to find his wife's body - three years after she went missing in the Japanese tsunami. Yasuo Takamatsu, 57, has been searching for his wife, Yuko, since she was swept away by towering waves on March 11, 2011. But after failing to find her on land, he has now resorted to scuba diving in a desperate attempt to recover her body. Searching: Yasuo Takamatsu, 57, has been searching for his wife, Yuko, since she was swept away by the Japanese tsunami on March 11, 2011. He has now resorted to diving in a desperate attempt to recover her body . Hope: Mr Takamatsu, pictured diving days before the anniversary of the disaster, described his wife as  'gentle' Support: During each dive, Mr Takamatsu (right) hoists a scuba diving tank on to his back, wears a rubber dry-suit and steps into the freezing ocean with the aid of diving instructor, Masayoshi Takahashi (front left) Mr Takamatsu, who has been pictured diving just days before the anniversary of the disaster, described his wife as a 'gentle and kind' individual. 'She would always be next to me, physically and mentally,' he said. 'I miss her, I miss the big part of me that was her.' He said his wife had sent him a final text message just half an hour after a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake shook Japan - causing the 66-foot tsunami to rush ashore. 'It read ""I want to go home"",' he said. 'That was the last message from her. I feel terrible thinking she is still out there. I want to bring her home as soon as possible.' Difficulty: Mr Takamatsu said he did not take to diving naturally - but that thinking about his wife had 'driven' him into the water. 'She would always be next to me, physically and mentally,' said the bus driver. 'I miss her' Diving: Mr Takamatsu, who uncovered his wife's phone following the tsunami, is pictured diving off a boat . Rescue workers later discovered Mr Takamatsu's wife's mobile phone while scouring the wreckage of the tsunami. After drying it off, Mr Takamtsu realised his wife had written a text message he had never . received - at almost exactly the time the waves were thought to have struck. '""Tsunami huge"". That was all she wrote in the very last one,' he said. Mr Takamatsu, a bus driver, said he did not take to diving naturally - but that thinking about his wife had 'driven' him into the water. Devastating: Mrs Takamatsu, then 47, is one of thousands of people still missing three years after the sixth largest earthquake in recorded history devastated Japan. Above, towering waves strike the country's coast . Wreckage: The earthquake sent the catastrophe tsunami hurling across the Pacific Ocean - wiping out entire communities, homes and families in the country. Above, a vehicle is covered in debris following the tsunami . 'I still feel just as I did when the disaster hit,' he said. 'Emotion-wise, I have not moved a bit since then. I will feel like this, I think, until I find her. 'I do want to find her, but I also feel that she may never be discovered as the ocean is way too vast - but I have to keep looking.' During each dive, Mr Takamatsu hoists a scuba diving tank on to his back, wears a rubber dry-suit and steps into the freezing ocean with the aid of diving instructor, Masayoshi Takahashi. Mr Takahashi, who leads volunteer dives to look for missing tsunami victims, said he thought it was important to help Mr Takamatsu find his wife. Fatal: More than 15,800 people are recorded as having died in the disaster - with a further 2,636 still missing . 'During . underwater search, unlike leisure diving, we have to dive in unclear . water and there is also the risk of getting trapped in the wreckage,' he said.

Not giving up: Mr Takamatsu said that he is desperate to find his wife's body so he can finally lay her to rest . When the waves subsided and the water rushed back out to sea, it took homes, cars and the bodies of thousands of the people it had killed with it. More than 15,800 people are recorded as having died in the disaster - with a further 2,636 still missing. Of these, more than 250 people remain missing from the . small fishing town of Onagawa alone, including Mrs Takamatsu. Heavy heart: He said hearing about his wife's fate had caused his knees to 'buckle' Mr Takamatsu said that he - like many other bereaved relatives -  is desperate to find his wife's body so he can finally lay her to rest. He recalled that his wife had been sheltering with her colleagues on the rooftop of a local bank when the tsunami struck. 'I was not too worried after the quake because she was with her colleagues at the bank, although it bothered me that I couldn't contact her,' he said. Mr Takamatsu, who had been with his mother-in-law at a hospital in the next town at the time, was not allowed to return the wrecked town, which was by then a seething, bobbing mass of buildings, fishing boats and cars. However, when the barriers were lifted the next day, he went to Onagawa's hospital, which sits on a hilltop, as the designated evacuation site where hundreds had fled soon after the huge quake. It was there that he learned the bank employees, including his wife, had been swept away. 'I felt my knees buckling. I felt nothing in my body,' he said. Three years after the disaster, Japan is not officially prepared to give up the search for its missing. Thousands of police, coastguard officers and volunteers still comb muddy areas around the mouths of rivers and scour the seabed. Meanwhile, search squads uncover human remains from time to time.","Yasuo Takamatsu, 57, lost his wife, Yuko, then 47, in the Japanese tsunami .

"By . Luke Garratt . PUBLISHED: . 14:05 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:08 EST, 8 March 2014 . Hayley Brown, 41, from Cleethorpes in Lincolnshire, who was sentenced for her Turkish property scam that targeted British investors . A con woman who stole hundreds of thousands of pounds out of British investors in a Turkish property scam has been jailed. Hayley Brown, 41, of Cleethorpes in Lincolnshire, conned her victims into shelling out large amounts of money, with one losing around £600,000 as a result of the scam. One 80-year-old farmer who was seduced by Brown's scheme claimed that he would have to work for the rest of his life as a result. Brown denied the ten offences of fraud, three of obtaining a money transfer by deception, and two of using a false document with the intent to deceive, between March 2006 and July 2009. She was jailed for four years after being convicted at Leeds Crown Court. An investigation found that £1.2 million was allegedly paid to Brown in the belief that property investment would follow. In a separate case, she was jailed for . five years after admitting two accounts of firearms offences, including . the possession of a disguised firearm in the form of a taser made to . look like a mobile phone, and the possession of a canister of 'CS type . gas', a prohibited weapon. Paul . Reid, prosecuting, said Brown's activities were 'thoroughly dishonest' and that she promised potential investors excellent returns on . properties in the Bodrum area of Turkey. Hayley Brown would convince people that she was investing money that they gave her in rental properties in Bodrum, Turkey . She would take her 'investors' on all expenses paid tours of their rental properties, but would not allow them inside, claiming that people were living there . The investors were seduced by the incredibly low investment prices, thinking they were getting a great deal on investments . Investors were 'seduced into parting with their money' by low purchase prices. They paid her and she told them she had bought properties in their name. They would receive rent income and, after three years, would have the option of renewing the arrangement, selling them, living in the properties or continuing to rent them out. Brown often paid for them and their families to stay in expensive hotels in Turkey and took them on tours of properties. They were told they could not go inside the actual properties because they were occupied by people paying rent, people came away feeling reassured. However, when rental income began irregular and they did not receive the returns they had been promised, investors instructed Brown to sell the properties, they were given excuses about why the proceeds had not materialised. They were shown false bank statements and forged official documents claiming to show money had been received by her, ready to be passed on. Mr Reid said: 'Many have received little or none of the original outlay, let alone the promised returns by way of rental income. 'Some are owed tens of thousands or, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of pounds. 'Throughout, this defendant has acted thoroughly dishonestly, to the extent of falsifying a number of documents. 'Hayley Brown has never been given permission to work in Turkey. She has never paid tax in Turkey. 'There are no properties we are aware of registered in her name in Turkey. 'She has produced forged documentation. She has lied consistently and persuasively. 'She has paid money to some people but that's a facade to keep the thing going. 'What she has been doing is financing her personal lifestyle.' Brown claimed after she was arrested in November 2009 she had millions of pounds invested in Turkish bonds and earned between £300,000 and £400,000 a year. Brown was sentenced before a jury at Leeds Crown Court, for two separate cases that were heard at different times . She was handed four years for her charges involving the investment scam at Leeds Combined Courts centre, as well as a further five years for breaking weapon laws . She 'dreamed up' millions of pounds supposedly invested in banks, including in Cyprus, but 'none of that money ever materialised'. Brown also forged e-mails between her and bank officials about transfers of large sums of money. Mr Reid said: 'There is a web of duplicity and fraud and straightforward dishonesty running through everything this defendant does.' Sentencing her to nine years in prison, Judge Guy Kearl QC said: 'You deceived investors into thinking they owned properties and they were receiving rent. 'You attacked the counsel throughout the trial and accused them of lying in the witness stand. You know particularly well who was lying in this case. Brown was from Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, and had, according to the prosecutor, never worked or paid taxes in Turkey . 'The effect you have had on others ought not to be under-estimated. The fraud you've committed is breathtaking.' Dc Graham Duncan, of Humberside Police, said: 'Victims invested large sums of money in the anticipation of purchasing property.

To tour or not to tour - that may well be the question the Globe Theatre will have to ponder after the company sparked a furious response from human rights groups by announcing it will stage a production of Hamlet in North Korea. The irony was not lost on critics, who were quick to point out the sinister similarities between Prince Hamlet's murderous revenge on his uncle Claudius in the Shakespearean tragedy - and North Korean despot Kim Jong Un's recent execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek. Although Globe officials would not confirm the date of their planned performance in Pyongyang, it is included within a two-year tour of 205 nations. Ay, there's the rub: Critics point out the irony of touring Hamlet (as portrayed by Laurence Olivier) in North Korea, where like the main character, despotic leader Kim Jong Un recently executed his uncle . The Globe will begin touring on April 23, which coincides with the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth. Niall Couper from Amnesty International told the Sunday Express: 'North Korea is a country where the horrors inflicted on people who fall out of favour are worse than any fiction. 'No tragic play could come close to the misery that the 100,000 people trapped in the country's prison camps endure, where torture, rape, starvation and execution are everyday occurrences.' The UN has accused of North Korea of multiple crimes against humanity and has urged world leaders to bring Kim Jong Un to trial at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. In one of his most recent shows of dictatorial power, Kim Jong Un ordered the execution of his uncle, Jang . Song Thaek, 67, following after a military trial in December. North Korea's official news agency said Jang had sought to 'destabilise the country' to take charge through a coup. Before . his death, Jang was considered one of the most powerful figures in . North Korea and he had served as a mentor to Kim Jong Un. In a statement Pyongyang called Jang . Song Thaek a 'traitor to the nation for all ages,' 'worse than a dog' and 'despicable human scum' who planned a military coup. In . a sharp reversal of the popular image of Jang Song Thaek as a kindly . uncle guiding young leader Kim Jong Un as he consolidated power, the . North's official Korean Central News Agency indicated that Jang instead . saw the death of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011 as an . opportunity to challenge his nephew and win power. Jang was also accused of corruption, womanizing, gambling and taking drugs. North Korea's main newspaper Rodong Sinmun ran a headline on its website that said: 'Eternal traitor firmly punished.' Execution: Jang Song Thaek was convicted of being a traitor in December 2013 and executed shortly after . A radio broadcast of the news was . piped into the subway and people sat quietly and listened as the . announcer listed Jang's crimes. During his two years in power, Kim . Jong Un has overseen nuclear and missile tests, other high-profile . purges and a barrage of threats, including vows of nuclear . strikes against Washington and Seoul. The White House said that 'if confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime.' Shortly after Jang's death, Kim Jong Un ordered the execution of his family members, including Jang's sister Jang Kye-Sun, her husband and Ambassador to Cuba Jon Yong-Jin and Jang's nephew and Ambassador to Malaysia Jang Yong-Chol, as well as his two sons. Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is visited by a ghost resembling . his recently deceased father, the King of Denmark. The ghost tells . Hamlet his father was murdered by Claudius, the Kingâ€™s brother, who took the throne and married Hamletâ€™s mother, Gertrude. Hamlet is racked with guilt as he debates whether to avenge his father's death by killing Claudius. Meanwhile, Ophelia is in love with Hamlet but their relationship breaks down as he becomes riddled with guilt. She eventually kills herself. Hamlet arranges for a group of actors to re-enact his father's murder to gauge Claudius' reaction. He then confronts his mother and accidentally kills Polonius. Laertes, the son of Polonius, returns to avenge his father's death. Claudius plots with him to use a poison sword, but in the event the swords are swapped and Laertes is mortally wounded. Hamlet eventually kills Claudius but not before he too is fatally wounded. The children and grandchildren of Jang's two brothers were also said to have been killed. In a case of life imitating art, family loyalty and a murderous struggle for power are key themes in Shakespeare's well-known play, Hamlet, which was written between 1599 and 1602. The play begins with Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, visited by a mysterious ghost who resembles his recently-deceased father, the King of Denmark. The ghost tells Hamlet he was murdered by Claudius, the King's brother, who seized the throne and married Hamlet's mother Gertrude. Hamlet is then inspired to avenge his father's death by killing Claudius. Despite sparking criticism, the Globe Theatre has defended its decision to tour Shakespeare's masterful production in North Korea. Artistic director Dominic Dromgoole said the company is often called upon to boycott different countries, . including China, Russia, Zimbabwe and the US. 'The Globe resolved then that everybody meant everybody.' Staff have also sought advice from the British Embassy in North Korea because of the potential diplomatic problems.

A neuroscientist has claimed the expression 'Men are from Mars and women are from Venus' has no scientific grounding, and that instead our brains are changed by the roles society forces us to play. According to Gina Rippon, a professor at Aston University in Birmingham, . stereotypes - such as women's supposed inability to read maps, or the idea men are bad at . multitasking - have no links to science. Instead of being wired in different ways, Professor Rippon said that men and women are only dissimilar because the world we live in encourages gender role-playing. Neuroscientist Gina Rippon, a professor at Ashton University, said this week that she believes gender differences are caused by society stereotypes. She said that gender differences have no scientific grounding . Speaking earlier this week, she said the differences between men and women are caused by the 'drip, drip, drip' of gender stereotypes. She said: 'You can't pick up a brain and say ""that's a girl's brain, or that's a boy's brain"" in the same way you can . with the skeleton. They look the same. 'There is pretty compelling evidence that any differences are . tiny and are the result of environment not biology.' The Telegraph reported that Prof Rippon said that she disagreed with gender stereotypes instilled in children from a young age. The fact that boys and girls are given different toys based on their sex is what creates gender differences within the brain, she said. By playing with a Barbie rather than a train, for example, a girl's brain is programmed to become more feminine. Professor Rippon also said that more emphasis should be placed on the fact that the brain is in fact a muscle - and can therefore be exercised according to what it is required to do. So for example spending a long time mutitasking, would cause the relevant section of a woman's brain would to develop. A woman's brain would therefore become wired to multitask because of the role that she is expected to play, she said. Giving children different toys according to their sex, such a Ken for a boy and a Barbie for a girl, creates gender differences within the brain, the professor from Ashton University argued . Professor Rippon's comments clash with American studies completed in December last year which highlighted differences in the way the brains of men and women are wired. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania scanned the brains of 1,000 men, women, boys and girls. Through the analysis, experts found that the male brain is wired from front to back whereas the female brain is crisscrossed from left to right. In a piece in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the researchers said that the differences in wiring could explain why men tend to be better at performing one task such as cycling whereas woman are more equipped for mutlitasking. On International Women's Day today, Prof Rippon will be speaking at the Women of the World festival, held at the Southbank Centre in London.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:13 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:24 EST, 13 November 2013 . Ed Miliband always looks startled because he has ‘got big eyes’ which affects whether voters see him as Prime Minister, Labour heavyweight Tom Watson has claimed. The former minister - who quit as Mr Miliband’s election strategist this summer - also said the Labour leader got it ‘so wrong’ over the Falkirk vote-rigging scandal and struggled to make headlines because he is too clever. Recent opinion polls show Labour extending its lead over the Tories, but more voters think David Cameron would make a better leader for Britain. However Mr Watson makes clear that after a faltering start he now believes Mr Miliband 'will be a good Prime Minister'. Miracle: Tom Watson (left) said Ed Miliband had been . 'learning on the job' and his main achievement was stopping the Labour . party tearing itself apart . Mr Miliband has repeatedly been likened to plastercine character Wallace, of Wallace and Gromit fame. In recent weeks he has made headlines with his promise to freeze energy bills and attacking the government over the cost of living. But a new ICM poll this week showed only 27 per cent of people think he would make the best Prime Minister, including only 64 per cent of people who backed Labour in 2010. A separate YouGov survey found just four per cent think he is a 'natural leader' - the same as Nick Clegg. Now Mr Watson has suggested the way Mr Miliband looks means voters might struggle to imagine him running the country. Mr Watson was being interviewed by comedian Matt Forde as part of the live theatre comedy show The Political Party, which is recorded as a podcast. Appearing on stage Mr Watson admitted that the Labour leader often looks startled even when challenging Mr Cameron in the Commons. ‘Well he has got big eyes. That doesn’t help him,’ Mr Watson said. He went on to suggest that Mr Miliband’s greatest achievement so far was preventing Labour tearing itself apart, but warned the first few years of his leadership were wasted by being too ‘clever’. Mr Watson said: ‘Did the right Miliband win? Yes, I think the most important challenge for the leader that won was to unify the party and I think Ed was the person who could most do that.’ Asked if he meant Mr Miliband uniting the party behind or against him, Mr Watson replied: ‘That’s a good question.’ He added: ‘The truth is I think it is a miracle he has held it all together.’ Mr Watson, who backed Ed Balls for Labour leader, said that when Mr Miliband won in 2010 ‘I wasn’t sure where he would go’. He . added: ‘He was a young leader who wasn’t supposed to win. There were a . lot of question marks over his leadership. He has done a lot of learning . on the job.’ Praise: Mr Watson said that at a recent PMQs, Mr Miliband looked like a leader while David Cameron appeared 'old and tired' Tom Watson was offered a 'staggering' amount of money to take part in Celebrity Big Brother - but turned it down. Taking questions during the Political Party comedy show, he said he was unsure if he wanted to be a minister again. An audience member suggested he sign up for Strictly Come Dancing. Mr Watson replied: 'I was offered a staggering amount of money from someone who said I should be on Celebrity Big Brother. 'I think I would be terrible at all that stuff.' Another audience member said the Labour heavyweight would be better suited to Great British Bake-Off. Mr Watson said that at a recent PMQs . Mr Miliband now looked like a ‘Prime Minister in waiting and David . Cameron looked old and tired and you wouldn’t have said that a year . ago.’ ‘Yes, I think he will be a good Prime Minister.’ He . said Mr Miliband had  a ‘particular problem’ facing a coalition, . because the Tories and Lib Dems were more interesting and he is ‘kind of . third on the newslists’. But he said Mr Miliband’s reputation as a policy wonk held Labour back . ‘If . I am being honest because he is so bright and clever and he is such a . thinker, he has been very good on the strategic stuff but learning to be . in opposition was a bit of a chore for us.’ He said too many of the Labour leadership had only ever been in government and struggled to make an impression in opposition. ‘For them to act as an opposition and seize issues and make them theirs was quite difficult for us in the early years.’ Mr Watson also turned his fire on the Labour leader over his handling of allegations of vote-rigging in Falkirk. In the summer he quit as election strategist over claims that he was involved in claims the Unite union signed up people to the Labour party without their knowledge in order to influence candidate selection in Falkirk. Mr Miliband reported Mr Waton’s office manager Karie Murphy to the police and has since refused to reopen the party inquiry, despite claims witnesses were pressured into changing their stories. Mr Watson said: ‘It's amazing how my own leader can be so wrong. But he was. ‘It's hard for me to say this, but Ed just got it wrong on Falkirk. ‘He was given information, or a report, that was inaccurate and omitted some key facts, and took judgements that really harmed the individuals involved in a grotesque way. ‘I suspect privately he is a little bit embarrassed about it.’ Mr Watson said he did not know if he would want to be a minister again – or if Mr Miliband would want him. ‘If Labour won the next election, do I want to be a minister, does Ed want me to be a minister? I honestly don’t know.’","Former minister says it is a 'miracle' the party has not split since defeat .

After almost a decade in a backyard workshop in suburban Sydney, during which it became the centre of a political row, the coach 'Britannia' built by Sydney man Jim Frecklington has may finally be put into service for the Royal Family, the Palace says .

Since successfully delivering his first coach (above) for the Royal Family in 1988 it has been in constant use, but Jim Frecklington has struggled with his second coach, which until now  has been something of a white elephant .

A former member of the royal household who worked as a carriage driver and cared for the Queen's ceremonial horses, Frecklington allegedly fell behind schedule for a 2006 delivery. He has since claimed the coach would be delivered for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012, then the birth of Prince George in July last year. Now it has finally been shipped to the UK, it is still unclear just who will use the carriage, which Buckingham Palace described as 'a private initiative which was undertaken by Mr Frecklington' and not a coach commissioned by the royal household. The coach, which Mr Frecklington says contains hundreds of historical items including wood from Lord Nelson's ship HMS Victory and from a tree known to William Shakespeare, took years of toil only to become a political football. Mr Frecklington, who made the Australian State Coach for Queen Elizabeth to mark the nation's 1988 Bicentenary celebration, began building the coach after the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Still in service, Jim Frecklington's 1988 coach (above, carrying the Queen in 2006) has been a royal success his subsequent carriage has failed to emulate, but which may now be put to use . Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip ride in the Asutralian State Coach accompanied by members of the Household Cavalry after the State Opening of Parliament in London, in 2012 . The onetime Australian government of staunch monarchist and former Prime Minister John Howard gave ardent monarchist James Frecklington a $245,000 taxpayer-funded grant towards the cost of construction. The 5.5 metre long coach, which has modern hydraulics, heating, air conditioning and power windows, is lined with military and other items Frecklington says he sourced from 'special contacts' he got to know while working for the Royal Family. The coach has bits of 'the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, St Paul’s Cathedral, Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Westminster, 10 Downing Street, Balmoral Castle, Blenheim Palace, Canterbury Cathedral, Hampton Court, Holyrood Palace and Kensington Palace'. Mr Frecklington said items incorporated into the vehicle were also taken from 'the Battle of Hastings, the Mayflower, the former royal yacht Britannia, a Battle of Britain spitfire a “Dambusters” Lancaster, part of a musketball from Waterloo and a sliver of Isaac Newton’s apple tree' along with objects relating to naturalist Charles Darwin, polar explorers Sir Ernest Shackleton and Robert Scott and mounatineer, Sir Edmund Hillary. Carole and Michael Middleton travel with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Prince Charles in the carriage to the wedding of their children, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William . Undelivered for the Queen's birthday, the coach became the subject of intense debate in the Australian Parliament, after John Howard lost office and the Australian Labor Party took power. Labor senator John Faulkner addressed Parliament in 2011 about the whereabouts of the carriage, which public servants apparently could not locate. The public servants claimed they didn’t know where the coach was, had never inspected it and there was never any contract for its manufacture. The Senate was told John Howard approved the $245,000 payment to Mr Frecklington to support 'Australian craftsmanship' as a gift to the Queen. Mr Frecklington told the MailOnline he could not comment about the coach, because he was 'under a confidentiality agreement with the Palace'. While it lay in Mr Frecklington's North Head workshop, he reportedly allowed visitors paid inspections, saying he'd had people from Melbourne, the Czech Republic (and) England come here and look at it'. Two years ago, he told the Sun Herald newspaper he was close to signing a deal with a 'large organisation' in Britain.

As the small aircraft wheeled around and nosedived onto the runway, Frost was launched into the air. Fortunately neither the skydiver or pilot were seriously injured by the impact. Frost has already been released from hospital, but Trembley was being kept in for observation. Trembley's wife, Dorothy, said her husband was having trouble speaking after cracking his trachea, and needed five stitches in his chin after the crash. Her husband, an experienced pilot who has been flying since 1946, tried desperately to get out of Frost's path, but his wing clipped the parachute lines.

Sinclair stood ramrod straight . before a judge Thursday and pleaded guilty to three charges that could . send him to prison for up to 15 years. It was a . remarkable admission sure to end the military career of a man once . regarded as a rising star among the U.S. Army's small cadre of trusted . battle commanders. Sinclair, 51, still faces . five other charges stemming from the claims of a female captain nearly . 20 years his junior who says the general twice forced her to perform . oral sex. But by pleading guilty to the lesser charges, Sinclair's . lawyers believe they will strengthen his case at trial by potentially . limiting some of the salacious evidence prosecutors can present. Scroll down for video . Adulterer: General Jeffrey Sinclair pleaded guilty yo committing adultery, which is a crime in the military . The . former deputy commander of the 82nd Airborne could be sentenced to life . in prison if convicted of the sexual assaults. Opening statements were . expected Friday. Asked by judge Col. James . Pohl whether he clearly understood the consequences of his admissions, . the decorated veteran of five combat deployments answered in a clear . voice, with no emotion: 'Yes sir.' Pohl . accepted Sinclair's plea after nearly three hours of often intimate . questions about the married general's flirtations and dalliances with . four women - three military officers and one civilian. Repeatedly, . Sinclair turned to his lawyer before answering, prompting the judge to . say: 'It's important that you tell me the truth as you recall it.' 'You'll get nothing but the truth from me,' the general replied. The . case against Sinclair, believed to be the most senior member of the . U.S. military ever to face trial on sexual assault charges, comes as the . Pentagon grapples with revelations of rampant rape and sexual . misconduct within the ranks. The U.S. Senate on Thursday blocked a bill . that would have stripped senior military commanders of their authority . to prosecute rapes and other serious offenses in the ranks. The bill was . firmly opposed by the Pentagon. The general . pleaded guilty to having improper relationships with two female Army . officers and to committing adultery with a third, the captain who was . his longtime mistress. Adultery is a crime in the military. When . asked by the judge if he was aware of the prohibition against senior . officers having relations with subordinates, Sinclair replied, 'Oh, yes . sir.' Rising star: Sinclair was once considered a rising star amongst military brass. His career is now likely to be over . He then described how the affair began . during a war tour in Iraq when his primary accuser asked if he wanted to . watch a movie. Once they were alone in his quarters, the general said . the young officer made sexual advances that he initially rebuffed. Pohl asked how Sinclair knew the woman wanted to have sex with him. 'Probably when she took her top off, sir,' the general said with a nervous chuckle. Sinclair's . wife of nearly 30 years has remained with him through his legal . troubles and served as a staunch public defender, though she was not in . the courtroom Thursday. The couple has two children. The . general admitted to violating orders by possessing pornography and to . conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. After he knew he was . under investigation, Sinclair also said he deleted nude photos from a . personal email account sent by a civilian woman with whom he was . childhood friends. Sinclair's lawyer Richard . Scheff has said the plea will strengthen the general's legal position. By admitting guilt on the charges for which there is the strongest . evidence, the married father of two hoped to narrow the focus of the . trial to charges that rely heavily on the testimony and credibility of . his former mistress. Life: Sinclair is a former deputy commander of the 82nd Airborne and could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of the sexual assaults . In pleading guilty to . possessing a cache of porn on his laptop in Afghanistan, a violation of . orders for soldiers in the socially conservative Muslim country, . Sinclair's defense hopes to limit the ability of prosecutors to use . those graphic images to shock the jury. Prosecutors . also have evidence Sinclair asked two female officers to send nude . photos of themselves to him. By conceding his guilt, the defense lessens . the relevance of the messages they exchanged. The primary accuser is . the only one alleging assault. Scheff said . Sinclair had long offered to plead guilty to the three charges as part . of a plea agreement, but the Army refused to make any deal without an . admission on the alleged assault. 'What . remains of this case really rests on the damaged and tattered . credibility of an individual who's not been truthful, who has lied . before the court, who has given inconsistent statements,' Scheff said . outside the courthouse. 'Frankly, I think it's an embarrassment that . this case will go forward. But it's going forward, and we'll have not . guilty verdicts at the end.' The defense will . present evidence that the female captain lied under oath during a . pretrial hearing in January about her handling of old iPhone containing . messages between her and the general. Lawyers for Sinclair have painted . the woman as a scorned lover who only reported the sexual assault . allegations after the general refused to leave his wife. Stand by your man: Sinclair's wife has stood with him throughout the many allegations of sexual wrongdoing . The . captain testified that on Dec. 9, shortly after what she described as a . contentious meeting with prosecutors, she rediscovered the iPhone . stored in a box at her home that still contained saved text messages and . voicemails from the general. After charging the phone, she testified . she synced it with her computer to save photos before contacting her . attorney. However, a defense expert's . examination suggested the captain powered up the device more than two . weeks before the meeting with prosecutors. The Associated Press generally does not identify those who say they were sexually assaulted. During . a pretrial hearing this week, a top Pentagon lawyer testified that the . lead prosecutor assigned to the case for nearly two years, Lt. Col. William Helixon, had urged that the most serious charges against . Sinclair be dropped after he became convinced the captain had lied to . him about the cellphone. Helixon was overruled by his superiors and . removed from the case last month, after suffering what was described as a . profound moral crisis that led to his being taken to a military . hospital for a mental health evaluation. The . new lead prosecutor, Lt. Col. Robert Stelle, said in court this week he . doesn't care what his predecessor thought about the weakness of the . evidence. It is highly unusual for an officer . of flag rank to face criminal prosecution, with only a handful of cases . in recent decades. Under military law, an officer can only be judged at . trial by those of superior rank.

A California businessman convicted in July of hiding millions in assets just to keep from paying child support and alimony after a nasty divorce was sentenced to 17 years and 8 months in prison Tuesday. Steven K. Zinnel, 49, first submitted his fraudulent bankruptcy filing way back in 2005, but the wait ended in a major victory for prosecutors who managed to win an historically long jail sentence against Zinnel, who was also slapped with a $500,000 fine and forced to forfeit assets worth more than $2.8 million. Things all began to unravel for Zinnel after he personally placed a call to the FBI while he was getting away with concealing some $4 million from the government. Northern California businessman Steven K. Zinnel was sentenced to a whopping 17 years in prison Tuesday for concealing millions of dollars from his bankruptcy claim in order to avoid paying child support and alimony to his ex-wife and mother of two teen kids Michelle (pictured) It was a fitting start to an investigation that spun upon the lengths the Gold River businessman went to hurt his ex-wife and keep as much money from her and their two teenaged children as possible. 'This case is more than a crooked businessman’s run-of-the-mine fraud. For Zinnel, this crime was personal. In these crimes, Zinnel showed his true nature: hateful, vindictive, and incorrigible,' read court papers filed by federal prosecutors. Divorce proceedings for Zinnel and his wife and mother of his two children Michelle began in 2001 and, according to the Sacramento Bee, Zinnel had put millions in others' names by June 2006. But keeping his considerable wealth from his wife apparently wasn't enough because it was that summer when Zinnel decided to call the FBI in an attempted to get his wife, who is a dental hygienist, investigated on charges she revealed confidential health information during their divorce hearings. 'It is hard to fathom what would lead . Zinnel to call the FBI while he was in the middle of a successful . multimillion dollar concealment offense,' wrote the federal prosecutors. 'But it is uncontested that this is what happened.' The . call would get the ball rolling steadily towards Zinnel's imprisonment . for 15 counts of money laundering and bankruptcy fraud. Dirty deals: Zinnel was convicted of hiding millions in income from five different corporate entities and funneling it through a shell company with the help of his attorney Darien Eidson . Even before the call and well before his bankruptcy claim, records show Zinnel had made up his mind about how he planned to get back at his wife. 'In an angry email, he told his ex-wife that he intended to file bankruptcy and she would get nothing,' read court documents. 'By late 2001 and early 2002, his calendar entries and to-do lists reflect a man busy at work with the various corporations, individuals, and property at issue in the case.' Over the course of their investigation, the FBI and IRS found that Zinnel had worked with his attorney Derian Eidson and others to ensure all the money he continued to receive from his many assets was concealed or funneled through a shell company set up by Eidson. All told, Zinnel was concealing money from five corporate entities with Eidsen's help. Eidsen was convicted along with Zinnel on July 17. U.S. District Judge Troy L. Nunley described Zinnel as 'narcissistic,' citing the defendant's repeated lies in bankruptcy and family courts. Prosecutors initially wanted 17.5 to 20 years for Zinnel. Prosecutors told the Sacramento Bee they believe Zinnel's 17 year sentence is the longest ever handed down for bankruptcy fraud in the Eastern District of California. When he left the court, recordings caught Zinnel showing off that true 'hateful, vindictive, and incorrigible' nature once more in a call with his son. As well as a remarkable ability to dole out blame. 'Daddy got railroaded,' the newly minted felon told the boy. 'This all started because of your mom.'","California investor Steven K.

On Friday morning the Jenkins family finally obtained the last of the children's passports and visas and then quickly packed in preparation of leaving early on Saturday morning.

Angela Cobbina, 41, who was Dutch banking giant ABN Amro's top lawyer in Britain, has claimed she suffered a miscarriage due to the stress of being hounded out of her job and subjected to a string of racist remarks . A senior lawyer at a global banking firm has claimed she suffered a miscarriage due to the stress of being hounded out of her job and subjected to a string of racist remarks. Angela Cobbina, 41, who was Dutch banking giant ABN Amro’s top lawyer in Britain, claims the firm’s UK chief executive Paul Schuilwerve made repeated racist comments at her expense and that led to her being 'systematically frozen out'. And she fears the stress of her ordeal could have contributed to her suffering a miscarriage early last year. Now Ms Cobbina is suing the bank for a reported £300,000 for sex, race and religious discrimination over claims she was a victim of a 'campaign' of harassment. A hearing at Central London Employment Tribunals today heard how Mr Schuilwerve strongly denies allegations of racism. However, the tribunal heard he threw his support behind the controversial Dutch tradition of ‘Black Pete’. The tradition, part of the annual Christmas St Nicholas parade, involves white people ‘blacking up’ and parading through the streets, has been condemned as racist by the UN. In documents presented to the tribunal, Ms Cobbina said Mr Schuilwerve began his racist abuse the first time he met her in September 2012. During the meeting in London he looked at a colour picture of the lawyer and remarked: 'We cannot even see you in the picture.' The lawyer claimed the remark was clearly a reference to her skin colour. 'I felt upset, humiliated and belittled by Mr Schuilwerve’s comment about my photo,' she said in her witness statement. 'I did not make a complaint about Mr Schuilwerve’s comment at the time because he had been my line manager for less than 2 weeks and I did not wish to be seen as a trouble maker or deemed ""sensitive"".' Ms Cobbina, of Streatham, south London, claims that over the next 12 months she was the 'target of a campaign designed to remove or drive me from the business.' She added: 'I was variously excluded, overlooked, targeted for undue criticism (including in connection with my performance, conduct, appearance and personal belief) and otherwise treated differently from my colleagues.' At a meeting the following June she claims Mr Schuilwerze again 'taunted' her about her race after one of their colleagues described himself as the ‘black sheep of the family’. The tribunal heard that the Dutch executive had said: ‘Speaking of that, what about Blackfriars? Let’s talk about all things black. Is Blackfriars the same as Blackadder?’ Ms Cobbina accused her boss of singling her out, and said: 'Mr Schuilwerve’s exaggerated enunciation whenever he mentioned the word ""black"". 'I felt this emphasis was unusual. I was and am clear that his words were connected to my presence. 'This is endorsed by the fact there is no logic to this remark. It is simply a series of unconnected words the incorporate the word black.' In the midst of the alleged racist campaign against her, Ms Cobbina discovered she was pregnant during the Christmas break 2012. The firm's UK chief executive Paul Schuilwerve strongly denies allegations of racism . She said she was 'ecstatic' at the prospect of becoming a mother for the first time, but claims Mr Schuilwerve bullied and intimidated her at a meeting on January 30 last year. She said: 'That night I experienced severe stomach pain and miscarried my baby. 'I will never know for certain whether these two events are related. But I connected them in my mind at the time and still do.' Despite the misscarriage she 'did not dare take the day off sick', the tribunal was told in Ms Cobbina's written statement. She said: 'I was devastated as was my partner. I could not believe that we had lost our child and even as I am putting together my witness statement I still feel numb. 'Instead of becoming a mother, I have been through an elongated grievance and appeal process at the same time as consulting with the bank about the ending of my employment for a period of almost seven months, before being dismissed from my job at a time when I should have given birth.' 'Instead of becoming a mother, I have been . through an elongated grievance and appeal process at the same time as . consulting with the bank about the ending of my employment' Angela Cobbina . When she complained about Mr Schuilwerve’s behaviour the firm 'made great show of conducting a confidential internal procedure' but he was 'kept abreast of developments' and was pushing for her dismissal. She was told in February 2013 the bank was considering axing her position as part of restructuring, and in September 2013 informed she being made redundant. Giving evidence today, Mr Schuilwerve was quizzed about his attitude to race after it emerged he ‘liked’ a petition to keep the ‘black Pete’ Christmas parades on his Facebook page. The father-of-three defended the petition, which was signed by more than one million Dutch people. He said was to protect the St Nicholas parade, a popular childrens’ event and had nothing to do with race. He told the hearing: 'There were certain individuals at the time who wanted to stop the tradition of the parade of St Nicholas and Black Pete conducted in the city of Amsterdam. 'This was a petition to support that tradition - it is a children’s festival. 'I have three children, and this is a very traditional event. There is nothing wrong with it. 'I’m also aware of the debate around the UN, I’ve said there is nothing wrong with this tradition. You have to see it in the context of Dutch tradition. 'And 91 per cent of the population support the tradition.' Challenged over his support of the festival, Jack Feeny, representing Ms Cobbina, said: 'Some people consider that to be racist.' Mr Schuilwerze said he was aware of this, but said 'racism doesn’t come into it'. In his witness statement, he said he has a 'zero tolerance attitude to discrimination and harassment issues' and found the allegations 'deeply hurtful'. Mr Feeny told the Dutch-born banker: 'You have prejudice against people of black descent.' However, Mr Schuilwerze replied: 'I do not.' The bank strongly denies all the allegations. The tribunal continues.","Angela Cobbina says she was 'frozen out' of Dutch banking giant ABN Amro .

'Fading away': Anne Todd, 71, was a healthy size 12 and weighed nine stone when she suddenly stopped eating for no apparent reason . A grandmother-of-three is slowly starving to death after suddenly refusing to eat food and losing half her body weight in just three months. Anne Todd, 71, was a healthy size 12 and weighed nine stone in November but her weight has since plunged to four stone and nine pounds in the space of a few months. Her distraught daughter Jackie Nelson, 46, revealed how her mother was active and healthy when she suddenly stopped going and started to refuse to eat. Mrs Todd has undergone checks by her GP, doctors, social services and a community mental health team but none have been able to explain the cause and say they cannot force her to eat. Her daughter has now released images of her ailing . mother in the hopes of discovering what may be the cause of her mother's sudden change. Mrs Nelson, from Nelson, Lancashire, said: 'We are in 2014. In this day and age people should not be starving to death. 'She wouldn't look out of place in Belsen. I am at my wit's end. 'It's . like seeing a ghost. I just feel like she's going to die a slow and . painful death unless she gets the help that she needs.' Mrs Todd told how her mother had been active and outgoing but suddenly stopped going out and refused to eat. She said: 'It happened so suddenly it was almost like someone had flicked a switch and she stopped eating. 'I don't think she eats a thing when she's at home and it's so upsetting to see her waste away. I'm watching her starve to death and I can't do anything to help her. 'Prior to that she had been quite active but she stopped eating and she stopped going out. Since then she's getting worse.' Mrs Todd has been taken to hospital five times since she stopped eating but doctors say she has no physical illness. 'Starving to death': Anne Todd, 71, pictured in hospital, has lost half her bodyweight in three months. Doctors and social workers have been unable to find a cause for why she suddenly stopped eating . She refused to celebrate Christmas at . her daughter's house as usual and by February 9 her condition had . deteriorated so much that her daughter was forced to call ambulance. Mrs Todd was taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital where she stayed for 10 days and underwent a series of tests - with no clear results. Mrs Nelson, a mother-of-two, has been off work due to stress over the situation and regularly takes cooked meals to mother which are left untouched. She added: 'I don't know what's caused this but there's been no real changes in her life to spark anything. Looking for answers: Jackie Nelson, 46, is trying to find out why her mother suddenly stopped eating . 'Her partner died nine years ago and she's lived on her own since then and got along just fine. 'I think maybe it's some sort of mental illness. The doctors have looked at whether she's got depression or the onset of dementia but then, when they assessed her, they said she's fine. 'It can't be a physical thing because she eats fine when she's in hospital but she'll probably be released in a few days and once she's home the cycle starts again. 'Because the doctors don't know what's wrong, they can't treat her. 'One doctor actually said to me that if she doesn't want to eat then that's up to her. 'I feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall and nobody is listening. 'The longer it takes for her to get the help she so desperately needs, the thinner she's getting. She's just skin and bone.' Following Mrs Todd's last hospital visit, a care package was implemented but Mrs Nelson said that has not not helped. She added: 'She has carers going in to see her but she is still refusing to eat and they can't force her. 'It's not their fault but everyone seems to be passing the buck. The care system is so difficult to navigate. 'You don't have to be medically trained to see that there is something seriously wrong with my mum. 'When she was admitted to hospital the nurses were aghast at how emaciated she was. Mystery: Doctors carried out a series of tests on Mrs Todd, pictured before her weightloss when she was a healthy size 12, but could find nothing wrong her . 'We keep being pushed from pillar to post and now it's got to crisis point. Somebody needs to get to the bottom of it before it's too late.' Rosehill Surgery in Burnley where Mrs Todd is registered as a patient said they could not comment because of patient confidentiality. Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust said: 'When a person is discharged from hospital, the Trust works closely with the individual and family to ensure that a suitable package of care is in place. 'The Trust adopts a person-centred care approach which supports individuals and helps them to make informed decisions and manage their own health care.'","Anne Todd, 71, was a healthy size 12 and weighed nine stone in November .

As a gale swept through Sheffield on the night of Friday, March 11, 1864, water engineer William Horsfield was sheltering under the town's new dam when he noticed a crack. It was only wide enough to take a penknife, but it stretched along the earthen bank for 50 yards, following a jagged line 12 yards from the top. Just before midnight the dam burst, sending 650 million gallons of water cascading into central Sheffield in a disaster which killed more than 240 people in their beds. Devastation: Quickly dubbed the Great Sheffield Flood, the torrent killed around 300 people and destroyed 700 buildings. Pictured: The remains of the Rowell Bridge Wheel in Loxley. One body washed up 18 miles away . Washed away: Hill Bridge in Walkley Lane, Hillsborough (pictured), was one of the 20 destroyed in the torrent . Half of those who died instantly were children, and around 60 more were killed as diseases swept through the stagnant water in the aftermath. Historians will mark the 150th anniversary of the tragedy on Tuesday - but they say one of Britain's worst disasters has been largely forgotten because the dead were northern and working-class. For years there was not a full-scale memorial to those who died in Sheffield, with only a small memorial stone near the village of Bradfield where the reservoir stood. Amateur historian Karen Lightowler, who devotes her . spare time to tracing victims' descendants, said: 'I am . passionate about the flood. It is this country's worst ever man-made disaster but virtually nobody knows about it. 'It's such a tragedy that so many people died through no fault of their own. Remembrance: Local historians say the disaster was largely forgotten because its victims were northern and working-class. For years there was no memorial in central Sheffield with only a memorial stone near the dam . 'If it had happened in London there would be an annual memorial for it. Everyone would know about it. But, because it was in the north and because it involved working class people nobody remembers it.' The dam was built by the Sheffield Waterworks Company near the village of Bradfield from 1859 to provide drinking water for the people of the fast-growing industrial town. It was also designed to provide a supply of running water for the mills in surrounding villages. But as it was being completed and filled the structure collapsed, sending water cascading down the Loxley Valley which devastated farms and hamlets devoted to metalworking. The floodwater then moved down to meet the River Don and laid waste to large areas of the centre of Sheffield. One body was found at Conisbrough - 18 miles downstream. Harrowing stories emerged of how many of the victims died. One person who drowned was a new-born baby washed from his mother's arms in Bradfield. Huge: Workmen inspect the break in the dam wall at the Dale Dyke Reservoir after it burst. A water engineer had noticed there was a crack a few hours before the disaster, wide enough to take a penknife . Toll: More than 100 died in the village of Malin Bridge, where many homes and the Cleakum Inn (left) , were left in ruins. The area has since been rebuilt and is now a suburb of Sheffield, which would become a city . Three children died in a cellar in Sheffield while their parents were away. Then a village and now a suburb, Malin Bridge was worst hit by the flood with 102 deaths. A photograph of the shattered remains of the Cleakum Inn, rebuilt later as the Malin Bridge Inn, is one of the many striking images of the disaster. Sheffield historian Ron Clayton, who lives in Malin Bridge, said it was 'ground-zero. It was devastated, whole families wiped out, buildings just washed away. 'If it had happened in London there . would be an annual memorial for it. Everyone would know about it. But, . because it was in the north and because it involved working class people . nobody remembers it.' - Amateur historian Karen Lightowler . 'The death toll of the flood was massive. There's nothing else to compare with it in peacetime in terms of man-made disasters. 'We remember pit disasters and other tragedies and I think it's only right this is remembered too.' Mr Horsfield raised the alarm after he spotted the crack at 5.30pm that day, but he thought it posed no major risk. It was examined later that evening but by 9pm the contractors had gone home, saying it would not be a danger to the public. That did not stop the water firm's resident engineer, a Mr Gunson, travelling with a colleague that night to examine the state of the dam. According to Samuel Harrison, a journalist who was writing at the time, they crossed the dangerously unstable bank before his colleague cried: 'If we don't relieve the dam of water there'll be a blow up in half an hour.' They tried to blow up a weir to relieve the pressure, but for one reason or another the gunpowder would not ignite. By then it was too late. As one inspector put it, according to Mr Harrison: 'Not even a Derby horse could have carried the warning in time to have saved the people down the valley.' Mr Horsfield's great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm Nunn, still lives in Bradfield and is the parish archivist. Memories: The reservoir still exists near the village of High Bradfield (pictured), six miles from Sheffield . Industrial heartland: The reservoir was being filled to provide drinking water to Sheffield's growing population . This weekend, locals gathered at an exhibition in the village to mark the anniversary, one of a number of events over the next few days to remember the disaster. The ceremonies will include a wreath-laying ceremony at a memorial to the tragedy in Sheffield city centre on Tuesday. Guided walks and church services are also talking place and primary school children will sing songs commissioned especially to remember the disaster. Mick Drewry, whose book on the disaster is due out later this year, said: 'It's not even very well known about in Sheffield, never mind nationally. 'It was a major historical event and it needs to be remembered properly.' Sarah Hung has travelled from Hong Kong to attend the memorial as she is descended from some of the victims. She said: 'It's such a massive disaster and it's right it's remembered like this even though it was 150 years ago.'","Dale Dyke dam built to provide drinking water to the industrial heartland .

While most cats love nothing better than lying indoors by the fire, five-month-old kitten Higgs is no ordinary feline. He loves his owners, Christian Witte, 30, and Kimia Mohammadi, 25,so much that he cannot bear to be parted from them for a moment, which means that when they go for a walk, he goes too. And if the weather's bad, he simply hops into Mr Witte's backpack. Scroll down for video .

Cling: Higgs may not look as if he's having the best time, but he hates to be separated from his owners . Backpacker: Higgs developed a love for travelling by rucksack after his owners put him there one windy day . The tiny kitten's love for the great outdoors emerged last month, when his owners went on holiday to the Scottish highlands and took their clingy pet with them. When they went out for a walk along the coastline of Sanna Bay, little Higgs was so frightened by the strong winds that he scrambled onto Mr White's back and into his rucksack. Now the tabby cat has made a habit of it. Ms Mohammadi, who like Mr Witte is a PhD medical engineering student at Glasgow University, said: 'He gets quite cosy in the backpack, and he likes looking around at what's going on.' She said: 'Christian organised the trip to the Highlands as a birthday surprise from me and, knowing how much I like Higgs, he decided to bring him along, too, although it was pretty random. She said the couple went for a picnic on the windswept beach and took the kitten along with them because it doesn't like being separated from them. 'It was his first time being out in nature - he had never been outside our tiny flat in Glasgow's Merchant City before - and we didn't know how he would react.

The kitten lives in a flat in Glasgow's Merchant City with owners Christian Witte and Kimia Mohammadi . 'We were pleased when he came with us, but when the wind got up we were worried about sand getting in his eyes, so we put him in Christian's rucksack. 'Later, he was just running around but the wind was quite strong again, and he must have remembered about the rucksack as he climbed up on Christian and found his way into the rucksack.' Ms Mohammadi said her pet had characteristics more suited to a dog than a cat. She said: 'He likes crawling around and he fetches things as well - he is like a dog in cat's skin. He is quite a strange cat, but I really like him.' The adventurous kitten is more like a dog than a cat, according to its owner, PhD student Ms Mohammadi . The couple took him to Glasgow Green last weekend, and because they had to cycle past an area popular with dogs to get there, they put him in Mr Witte's rucksack again. Ms Mohammadi said: 'It would be great to have a dog-free park where Higgs could just run around.' The couple named their kitten after Nobel Prize-winning British physicist, Peter Higgs, 84, who discovered the boson Higgs 'God particle'. Ms Mohammadi added: 'I'm a very geeky scientist and so is Christian, and Peter Higgs got his Nobel Prize around the same time that we got him.

Heading out: After completing the task the star was escorted out of the restroom . The early appearance of the black bar seems to confirm claims made by TMZ that officers had complained of . encountering some difficulties in censoring the footage. The . release of the footage comes after Judge William Altfield said two of . the five unreleased video clips depict the singer's genitalia during a . urine test for drugs at the Miami Beach Police Department. Altfield . agreed with lawyers for Bieber, who turned 20 on Saturday, that the . video's airing would be an invasion of privacy that outweighed the . public's right to know.

'He has not lost his right to privacy, and . that is what is important here.' Attorneys . for The Associated Press and other news outlets had previously . suggested any sensitive portions be blacked out and the rest released . under Florida's liberal open records laws. Official record: The pop star was made to show his tattoos to police following his arrest in January . Much of the footage was released last week, some of it showing Bieber walking unsteadily during a sobriety test. Bieber has pleaded not guilty to charges of driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license. He . and R&B singer Khalil Amir Sharieff were arrested early on January . 23 during what police called an illegal street drag race between a . Lamborghini and a Ferrari. Neither has been charged with drag racing. Bieber attorney Roy Black said he was satisfied with the ruling, as did media attorneys. AP . attorney Deanna Shullman said the news organization would never show . Bieber's private parts and Scott Ponce, representing The Miami Herald . and CBS television stations, said the ruling was more about protecting . the singer from random releases on the Internet. 'It's more about what someone in the private sector might do,' Ponce said. Black . said the three clips to be released without redaction are shot from an . angle that is too far away to discern what is going on. Prosecutors said they will release all five remaining clips in a few days, after the court-ordered redactions are completed. Additionally, a video showing the Baby singer led by a guard while in jail to undergo his urine drug test has also been released. Separately, . the Miami Beach Police Department made public a new batch of 18 still . photos taken shortly after Bieber's arrest, mainly close-ups of his many . tattoos - a praying Jesus, a grinning joker's face accompanied by the . word 'love,' an Indian chief's head, a Psalms quotation, and more - and . one full-length picture of the singer.

Right to privacy: The Miami judge did rule to blackout the star's genitals for the public version of the video . Evidence released previously showed that a breath test found Bieber's blood-alcohol level below the .02 threshold considered intoxicated for underage drivers. The urine test found the presence of the active ingredient in marijuana and the antianxiety drug Xanax. Bieber told officers he had been smoking marijuana before his arrest, according to police reports. A trial date has not been set. Altfield set another status conference for next week in the case.

Alexander McQueen's wildy romantic fairytale show in Paris may have had fashion fans under a spell but it's bound to rile animal lovers. From hand-cut fur pom poms to hooded fur gilets, the fashion house's AW14 was almost entirely made up of the controversial material. Designer Sarah Burton, who came to the attention of the wider public after designing the former Kate Middleton's wedding dress, sent her models down the runway as fairy-tale heroines roaming a make-believe forest with their fur-embellished gowns trailing behind them. Scroll down for video . Fur galore: Nearly all of the models wore fur in Alexander McQueen's AW14 show in Paris yesterday . According to her show notes, . the inspiration was floral and nocturnal fauna, Beauty and the Beast, and wild romance. By swathing her models in super-sized hooded fur coats, Burton made it clear that fur is back on the fashion agenda for AW14. This is a stark contrast to the late Eighties when celebrities queued up to express their horror at the thought of so much as a mink-trimmed cuff. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) was born and in 1994 five supermodels posed nude to protest against wearing fur, along with the slogan 'I'd rather go naked than wear fur.' This campaign has run and run and was most recently fronted by Khloe Kardashian. Such was public disgust, those who did venture out in a pelt were likely to find themselves splattered with red paint (or a dead raccoon in Anna Wintour's case). But these good intentions didn't last long and slowly, fur crept back into fashion. Even the eyelashes are furry! A model showcases a furry jacket from McQueen's collection . Fur overload! Models in super-sized hooded fur coats made their way down the runway . Back in fashion? Burton made it clear that fur is back on the fashion agenda for AW14 . What a difference a few years makes: The show was a stark contrast to the late Eighties when celebrities queued up to express their horror at the thought of so much as a minktrimmed cuff . Behind the scenes, the fur industry is fighting back, encouraged, it seems, by fashion's most influential - such as Kate Moss and Rihanna - who trot out draped in the stuff. So is fur back in fashion and will we all be wearing it come autumn? No, say PETA [People . for the Ethical Treatment of Animals], who point to a recent Times News . Service poll which found that 95 per cent of British women say they . wouldn't wear fur. 'Fashion designers should be forward-thinking innovators. In contrast, parading animal pelts down the catwalk is simply archaic,' said a spokesman. 'Stella McCartney, Calvin Klein, Simone Rocha, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste and Diesel are just some of the designers that shun fur and instead work with luxurious, exciting, sophisticated, cruelty-free fabrics, from metals to spun acrylic and satin, and we hope to see Burton embrace new cutting-edge fabrics that don't bleed. In this day and age, there's absolutely no reason for animals to be killed for fashion.' 'I wonder how many animals had to die for . Rita Ora and Rihanna’s wardrobes. They might be chart toppers, but . they’re also barbarians' Fashion blogger Simon Glazin was appalled by what he saw on the catwalk. He said: 'I actually gasped out loud when I trawled through the catwalk shots from Sarah Burton’s latest McQueen adventure. Not out of joy, but of sheer horror at the amount of fur she decided to use. 'The collection is named ‘Beauty and the Beast’ – but I’m inclined to add an –ly onto the end of the latter. 'The mind boggles. Do these designers just turn a blind eye to the fur industry? Do they just think it happens to fall off the animals in a glorious, gift-giving way like apples dropping from their branches? 'I realise there are those customers who demand fur, who love to wrap themselves up in the stuff, but it’s down to the labels and editors (yes, you Anna Wintour!) to stop this happening. You can do glamour without skinning foxes and mink alive – just look to Stella McCartney or brilliant faux fur label, Shrimps. I imagine if these fashion houses decided to turn around imitation fur pieces too, they’d sell like hotcakes. Fur, fur, everywhere: The collection is named 'Beauty and the Beast' - but I'm inclined to add an -ly onto the end of the latter, says Simon Glazin . 'You can bet your bottom dollar that the Duchess of Cambridge won’t be seen in any furry Alexander McQueen creations, she might even stay clear of the label altogether now. And I wouldn’t blame her. Mr and Mrs Kim Kardashian love a bit of fur, and I wonder how many animals had to die for Rita Ora and Rihanna’s wardrobes. They might be chart toppers, but they’re also barbarians.' Celebrity stylist Alex Longmore added: 'Unfortunately, It does not surprise me one bit that there is fur on the McQueen catwalk. It's everywhere and is not just reserved for autumn. This SS14, Louis Vuitton have shaved mink dresses and the Fendi catwalk is full of fur - and that’s for the hot summer months! 'Gone are the days of supermodels posing for anti-fur campaigns with slogans such as ""I'd rather go naked than wear fur"". Once upon a time fur was deemed non-PC but now that rule has been totally sidelined. Fur seems to have been made not only fashionable but to be the ultimate in luxury by the design houses. Wrapping up warm: Supermodel of the moment Cara Delevingne can often be spotted wearing her fur-trimmed hood coat . Change of heart? Naomi Campbell once posed in favour of anti-fur but seems to have changed her mind . Remember when...? Cindy Crawford also seems to be an avid fan of fur goods despite once posing for PETA . Big fan: Rihanna has no qualms about her penchant for fur coats and often sports fur stoles too . Generation cruel? Liberty Ross, Kate Moss and Kim Kardashian have all been spotted wearing fur coats - even though Kim's sister Khloe is the face of PETA's anti-fur campaign . 'As a passionate animal lover, I find this very hard to stomach. I find it absolutely shocking that fur is being so accepted and is now trimmed on nearly every parka or winter coat you see on the high street. 'There are some seriously good faux fur available now, especially from Shrimps (sold on Avenue 32) which is the ultimate in cool and doesn’t hurt a soul. Of course it doesn’t help that celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Kate Moss and Beyonce wear fur. 'If only they could see how it doesn’t need to be real to be on trend - see how good Laura Bailey and Fearne Cotton look - you can't even tell it isn't the real thing.' Encouragingly, several industry heavyweights all refuse to use fur in their collections. Stella McCartney is one designer for . whom pelts just don't pay, telling Grazia that: 'everything in my store . and every single garment and accessory that you see is cruelty free in . the sense that no animal has died to make anything in here.'

Mr . Khan told Radio 4’s Today programme the Lawrence family wanted ‘heads . to roll’. He said: ‘Officers who were involved in the initial failed . investigation, which was labelled “institutionally racist”, all senior . officers either resigned, one officer, a Detective Inspector Bullock as . he was at the time, was taken before a disciplinary committee but . nothing in effect happened to him.

March 2014 Ellison report suggests one of the officers in the original investigation was corrupt. ‘So . despite all the stories that we’ve heard, all the evidence that we’ve . seen and now this [the Ellison] report, not a single officer has been . held to account for any of their failings either in relation to . institutional racism and now institutional corruption and this goes to . the highest level.’ Mr Khan . said it was important to establish who had ordered undercover officers . from the Yard’s Special Demonstration Squad to gather information on the . Lawrence family. He said: ‘If these officers from the SDS were all . junior officers, undercover officers… were doing the things that they . were tasked to do, the question then arises, well who told them to do . that, why was that done and how high up did this go in terms of the . information, how was it used?’ His . comments heaped pressure on former Met chief Lord Condon, who yesterday . issued a statement denying he had ordered – or even had knowledge of – . the spying operation in the late 1990s. Asked . whether he thought any senior officers had committed criminal offences, . Mr Khan said: ‘Yes. Absolutely. 'I have no doubt about that. 'We have had . our suspicions from the outset. ‘What . we want to now have is evidence, so that that evidence can now be . presented either in the criminal court or in a tribunal... and those . officers either rooted out or to face, as Doreen wants, criminal . prosecution and... those officers at senior level who made mistakes or . otherwise acted improperly, for their heads to roll.’ Mr Walton was an acting detective inspector 16 years ago when he met the police spy to enable him to brief Lord Condon. The . timing was crucial. The Macpherson inquiry into Stephen’s murder was . preparing to hear final submissions from interested parties – in . particular the Met. Mr . Walton was part of the Met team set up to assess its response to the . inquiry hearings, which had inflicted serious damage on the force’s . image and reputation. Mr . Walton said yesterday: ‘I welcome any scrutiny of my role in these . events over more than 16 years ago, including in the forthcoming public . inquiry.’ In 1999, the Mail . revealed that not a single police officer would be disciplined over the . botched investigation into Stephen’s murder. The newspaper named five . senior officers who had made crucial mistakes yet escaped serious . sanction. Strict rules to prevent police whistleblowers from speaking to journalists should be reconsidered in light of the Stephen Lawrence report, MPs said last night. Lord Justice Leveson used his controversial report into media ethics to call for a clampdown on Press-police relations, with records kept of all meetings. John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture select committee said he was concerned the rules were too stringent and would deter legitimate journalism. There are also fears that scandals would remain secret because officers would not be able to go to the Press to expose them. Confirmation that police spied on the Lawrence family came only because a former undercover officer went to the media. Calling for a rethink, Mr Whittingdale said: ‘The Leveson recommendations were around the kind of corruption which has been exposed and has led to criminal charges, when the police may have been paid for information. ‘But what one wants to ensure is that these measures do not stop legitimate journalistic investigations to expose the kind of practice horrifically revealed in the case of Stephen Lawrence.’","Police lies exposed in official report into the Stephen Lawrence case .

"PUBLISHED: . 21:06 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:53 EST, 8 March 2014 . An Army captain at the center of a sexual assault case that has scandalized the U.S. military testified Friday that a general twice forced her to perform oral sex on him during their three-year, illicit affair. Taking the stand on the first day of Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair's court-martial, the woman said the assaults took place in Afghanistan in late 2011 as she grew increasingly despondent over their adulterous relationship. Both times, she said, they got into arguments that ended with Sinclair unbuttoning his pants and forcing her head into his lap as she cried. Sinclair, the 51-year-old former deputy . commander of the storied 82nd Airborne Division, is believed to be the . highest-ranking U.S. military officer ever court-martialed on sexual . assault charges. U.S. Army Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair leaves the courthouse at Fort Bragg in North Carolina on March 4, 2014 . He could get life in prison if found guilty. The trial is unfolding with the Pentagon under heavy pressure to confront what it has called an epidemic of rape and other sexual misconduct in the ranks. On Thursday, the Senate rejected a bill that would have stripped commanders of authority to decide whether to prosecute serious crimes. Sinclair's accuser testified that the first assault took place in her office in Kandahar when she told him how she hated her life, hated working for him and believed the general was just using her for sex. 'He grabbed me by the back of the neck and pushed me down. I tried to pull back, and he put his other hand on my shoulder,' she said. 'It felt disgusting. It felt like I had no control over my body.' She said the second assault took place in his office days later after she asked him to move her to another job. She said that after that episode, they never had sex again. Asked why she did not come forward and report what happened until March 2012, she said: 'I knew if I said anything, it would be my word against his and no one would believe me. I had no way out.' She will return to the stand on Monday for cross-examination by the defense, which is expected to attack her credibility. The defense says she lied about when she found a cellphone with text messages between her and the general. They also point out that when she first confided to a colleague about the affair in March 2012, she made no mention of being assaulted. Earlier Friday, she testified in detail about how the affair developed, and said that Sinclair once threatened to kill her and her family — and 'do it in a way no one would ever know' — if she ever told anyone about their relationship. She was given immunity in exchange for her testimony. Adultery is a crime under military law. In opening statements, prosecutor Lt. Col. Robert Stelle painted Sinclair as a man who . used his authority to intimidate and coerce a female officer nearly 20 . years his junior into sex. Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair leaves the courthouse following a day of motions, Tuesday, March 4, 2014, at Fort Bragg, N.C. Defense lawyers portrayed Sinclair as the victim of a desperately infatuated woman who became angry when she discovered that another woman had sent the general an email that closed with 'I love you'. The defense also contends Sinclair is the target of overzealous prosecutors under political pressure to make an example of him, despite weak evidence and an accuser with a history of telling lies. Defense attorney Ellen C. Brotman began her opening statement by reading the jury — composed of five two-star generals — excerpts from the woman's diary, written during the affair. Even after he was alleged to have threatened to kill her loved ones, she wrote of her desire for him, Brotman said, and the only fear she expressed was that he might still love his wife. 'I'm so in love with him,' Brotman read from the diary. 'I do know that I love him incredibly. ... I love him almost unconditionally.' Their relationship began in Iraq in 2009. He was her direct commander, a paratrooper revered for bravery under fire. She was a young intelligence officer and Arabic linguist, assigned to accompany him on trips to meet Iraqi leaders. She said that after months of conversation and flirtation, she went to his quarters late one night and they watched a television show. He asked her to put down her hair, which she typically wore in a bun while in uniform. She complied, and he began stroking her hair. Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair leaves the courthouse with his lawyers Richard Scheff, left, and Ellen C. Brotman, following a day of motions Tuesday, March 4, 2014 . They kissed that night, and the relationship soon evolved into frequent sexual liaisons. 'It was wrong,' she testified. 'I knew it was wrong.' She . testified that he often spoke of his wife and children and that he . described his spouse as an open-minded woman who understood he needed to . have sex while overseas. She said she assumed Sinclair had told his wife about her. Once, . after sex, the captain testified, the general told her that she . reminded him of his wife, and she replied that she looked forward to . meeting her. The captain said Sinclair sharply told her that his wife could never know about their affair. 'He . told me that if I ever told her or anyone else about he and I, he would . kill me and then he would kill my family,' the witness said, sobbing. 'And he would do it in a way no one would ever know.' Still, the woman admitted, she continued to have sex with him. Sinclair pleaded guilty Thursday to adultery and other charges that could send him to prison for up to 15 years. His lawyers are hoping the plea will limit some of the salacious evidence and reduce the case to his word against hers. Defense . lawyers will likely use some of the thousands of messages she exchanged . with Sinclair to challenge her, including affectionate emails she sent . the day before she confessed to the affair. The captain signed off by saying she 'owed' him, a code word defense lawyers say the paramours used as a substitute for 'love'. 'I hope you are doing super great and feel the positive energy I'm trying to send you way!' she wrote to her alleged abuser. 'You will know it's working if you feel SUPER GREAT today!!! I will always owe you the most Sir!'","Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair, 51, is the highest-ranking American military officer ever to face a court martial over sexual assault charges .

They say the 6.5ft tall alabaster figure of a pharoanic princess is part of a huge 465 feet tall statue. Dating from approximately 1350 B.C, the mysterious giant was found outside the southern city of Luxor. The giant statue of King Amenhotep III's daughter dating from approximately 1350 B.C., outside the southern city of Luxor. Amenhotep III reigned from c1390 - 1352 BC, when Egypt had become the richest and most powerful nation on earth through war and conquest. Countries like Babylonia, Assyria, and Mitani were emerging as potential new rivals, and Amenhotep began writing to the other rulers of the Near East, carving letters on small stones that messengers took to foreign princes. The Amarna letters, as they became known after they were found in 1887, were the key to Amenhotep's success, especially when backed up with gifts from Egypt's great wealth. In the southern part of his kingdom, Amenhotep and wife Tiy were worshipped as gods. Amenhotep's new temples were also dedicated to Egypt's many gods, particularly Amen-Re, the king of the gods. The Egyptian Minister of Antiquities Mohammed Ibrahim said the statue was once part of a larger statue that was nearly 14 meters (456 feet) tall and guarded the entrance to a temple. Ibrahim says the statue is of Iset, the daughter of Amenhotep III, and is the first found that depicts her without her siblings. Archaeologists uncovered the statue next to the funerary temple of Amenhotep III, who was worshipped as a deity after his death. An Egyptian-European team uncovered the statue of princess Iset, 170 centimetres tall and 52 cm wide, during renovation work at the Amenhotep III mortuary temple on Luxor's western bank, Ibrahim said.

The princess's name and her titles, among them 'Love of her father', were carved on the statue, Asfar added.

BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan called Andy Murray 'the moodiest most miserable b******' she has ever met during a talk with students . Gabby Logan has branded Andy Murray the ‘most miserable b******’ she has ever met. The TV presenter was joking with an audience about her experience interviewing him at last summer’s Olympics. He was in such a foul mood after losing the mixed doubles final that she just wanted to tell him to ‘cheer up’. The BBC sports presenter said: ‘I was a big fan. Then at the Olympics he had just won a silver with Laura Robson and he was the moodiest, most miserable b****** I’ve ever met in my life, because he only won a silver.’ She added: ‘If I wasn’t on live telly I’d have gone “cheer up”.’ Defeat in the doubles final came the same day he had been beaten Roger Federer in the men’s singles final to win Olympic gold. The following year Murray became the first British man in 77 years to win Wimbledon, defeating Novak Djokovic in  the final. The former gymnast, who is married to ex-rugby player Kenny Logan, may come across as motherly and mild, when coaxing contestants onto the diving board in ITV’s Splash! – but it seems she has a sharp tongue on her, too. During the talk at Leeds Trinity University, Mrs Logan, 40, also poked fun at marathon runner Paula Radcliffe about the time she stopped to relieve herself during a race, saying: ‘One guy tweeted and said “my wife thinks Paula’s dress is nicer than yours”. So I showed Paula and she p***** herself. Again.’ And she joked about footballer Ryan Giggs’s affair with his  sister-in-law and mocked former England star Gary Lineker for becoming a ‘crisp salesman’. Speaking about her fellow BBC presenter, she said: ‘A lot of people don’t see Gary as a footballer any more, they see him as a crisp salesman… sorry, they see him as a broadcaster.’ Her spokesman said: ‘These quotes clearly formed part of a humorous speech.’ The Splash! TV presenter admitted she and her husband worry that Lois, who is eight, could develop body image issues as she grows up. Mrs Logan represented Wales in rhythmic gymnastics but was forced to retire from the sport aged 17 due to sciatica. Gabby Logan said he she had not been on live TV she would have told Andy Murray to cheer up . Laura Robson (right) and Andy Murray (left) display their silver medals during a ceremony at the end of the London 2012 Olympic Games mixed doubles tennis tournament . She kept a diary during her teenage years and admitted that she wrote about feeling uncomfortable with her changing body once she hit puberty. Mrs Logan who co-presented Olympics 2012 for the BBC alongside Clare Balding, made her comments in a wide-ranging interview in which she spoke about the importance of healthy eating in her family and being able to recognise hunger. Mrs Logan said: ’I would never want my daughter to think she had to eat less of something. We talk about over eating, about how that’s not good, to eat more than you need to. All in good jest: Gabby Logan also poked fun at Gery Lineker and Paula Radcliffe during the talk . ‘But at the same time you can give those messages without it being about body image, it’s about health again. It all comes back to health as opposed to being svelte or fitting into your jeans.’ Mrs Logan, who is married to Kenny, 41, said: ‘I was always aware, when you do gymnastics you’re always in a leotard – you can’t be any more, the next thing is being naked. And so you’re very aware of your body so when I hit puberty I didn’t want to change.' Mrs Logan has now joined a Tesco healthy eating campaign called Eat Happy.","The TV star was speaking to students at Leeds Trinity University .

"By . Hugo Duncan . and Lucy Crossley . PUBLISHED: . 04:38 EST, 9 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:53 EST, 10 March 2014 . The troubled Co-operative Group sparked outrage yesterday over plans to give senior staff ‘obscene’ pay deals despite the near collapse of its bank. New chief executive Euan Sutherland is in line to get £3.66million – despite the fact that only last month he admitted that 2013 was ‘perhaps the worst year’ in the mutual’s 150-year history. Richard Pennycook, the Co-op’s chief operating officer, will receive £1.8million in total. And a dozen senior executives will enjoy huge pay rises despite plans to cut 5,000 jobs and the biggest losses ever recorded by the group. Pay deal: The Co-op is recommending that chief executive Euan Sutherland, who joined in May 2013 and heads the group's entire operation - from banking to supermarkets, should get a package worth a total of £3.66million . The Co-op is still reeling from the . discovery of a £1.5billion black hole at its bank and a sex and drugs . scandal involving former bank chairman and Methodist minister, Reverend . Paul Flowers. Later this . month it is expected to reveal that it made a £2billion loss last year, . and the group is reportedly interested in selling off its farms and 750 . pharmacies to make savings, which could mean between 4,000 and 5,000 . staff are laid off. The revelations are embarrassing for the Labour Party, which has close links with the Co-operative movement. The . Co-op Bank has provided financial support to Labour for years and 32 . Labour MPs – including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls – are also members of . the Co-operative Party. Yesterday, . Shadow Treasury Minister Chris Leslie, one of the MPs sponsored by the . Co-op, said: ‘I think the Co-op should be acting differently. Accused: The bank's former chairman, the Reverend Paul Flowers was accused of buying class A drugs, including crystal meth, cocaine and ketamine - a horse tranquilliser also popular as a party drug. 'They . recently put out a questionnaire to the public about their objectives . and I didn’t see in it anything about, “Do you agree with extending high . remuneration for senior executives”. So I have to say it is a bit . disappointing.’ Luke Hildyard, head of research at the High Pay Centre, said: ‘This flies in the face of everything the Co-op stands for.’ Sarah . Wilson, chief executive of Manifest, a corporate governance . consultancy, said: ‘The membership is going to be shocked and feel let . down.’ Co-op chairman . Ursula Lidbetter defended the plans. ‘The remuneration packages of our . executives are in the middle of a range of comparable companies,’ she . said. ‘This represents an . increase on the pay of their predecessors to reflect the greater . commercial, management and turnaround experience they are bringing to . bear.’ Comparison: The packages were put together after comparison with FTSE30 and FTSE100 companies of a similar size to the Co-op group, which includes its supermarkets and bank . Questions about the . management of the . bank, which came close to collapse and had to be rescued, were raised . following drug revelations surrounding Mr Flowers, including why he had . been given such an important role . despite his lack of banking knowledge. Last . month Mr Sutherland said 2013 had been the worst year in the group's 150-year . history, and warned that the forthcoming annual financial results would . be 'difficult', and 'very ugly'. According . to The Observer, internal documents prepared for the Co-op's . remuneration and appointments committee and marked 'private and . confidential', suggested that Mr Sutherland would be paid a base salery . of £1.5million, a £1.5million retention payment and pension contributions and other expenses. Last year his predecessor, Peter Marks, was paid just over £1.3million. The . documents suggests that the financial package for Mr Sutherland, and . other members of the executive team were needed because 'the [Co-op's] executive agenda is possibly the most complex one facing a large business in the country today'. High pay: Previous chief executive Peter Marks (pictured) was paid just over £1.3million, far less than is planned for his predecessor . Chief operating officer Richard Pennycook with receive a £900,000 . salary and a matching retention . payment, and six other executives will receive salaries and retention . sums of between £500,000 and £650,000 - compared to previous figures of . between £200,000 and £400,000. The . packages were put together after comparison with FTSE30 and FTSE100 . companies of a similar size to the Co-op, which is owned by its eight . million members. Ursula . Lidbetter, Chair of The Co-operative Group, told MailOnline: 'Last year . The Co-operative Group faced the biggest crisis in its 150-year history . with the need to recapitalise its Bank. 'We saved the Bank, without . recourse to the taxpayer and we are now embarking on the long and . complex journey to revitalise the wider Group. The Co-operative Group's £2billion losses expected to be announced on March 26, are believed to stem mainly from its banking division, as well as a reduction in the value of its supermarkets. The bank had to be rescued at the end of last year, with US hedge funds and other investors emerging with control over the division. It had merged with the Britannia building society in August 2009 and two years the bank announced a deal to take over 632 branches of LLoyds. However, losses were building, partly down to commercial property and the Britannia's soured corporate loans, as well as a failed IT project. The bank revealed an annual loss of £674million in March 2013 and abandoned the Lloyds deal. Last May the bank's debt rating was downgraded by ratings agency Moody's and it was revealed that more than 10per cent of its commercial loans were 'impaired'. The bank's chief executive Barry Tootell stepped down and in June the bank revealed there was a £1.5billion black hole. 'That means reducing debt, . improving performance and streamlining a business that had become . grossly inefficient. It is against that backdrop that we recruited Euan . Sutherland and a top team with the skills and experience needed at this . crucial stage in our history, reflecting the necessity for change. 'The . remuneration packages of our executives are in the middle of a range of . comparable companies. 'This represents an increase on the pay of their . predecessors to reflect the greater commercial, management and . turnaround experience they are bringing to bear. 'Euan and his team have . already made a significant contribution to The Co-operative Group and we . are confident that they will continue to do so.' Although the bank's rescue was achieved . without the need for help from the taxpayer,  70 per cent of it is now . controlled by a group of US hedge funds and the restructuring left many . customers with fears over its future direction. Many customers chose to use the bank because of its ethical policy, which reflects their own concerns regarding issues such as animal welfare, the arms trade, genetic modification and human rights, as well as the fact that the group is owned and run by its members - who all have an equal say and share in the profits. The Co-Operative group has previously said it is committed to preserving the bank's ethical focus, despite the presence of the hedge funds. Lord Oakeshott, the former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman and a Co-operative Bank customer said that managers at the group should only be 'well rewarded' after turning the business around. 'Gigantic golden hellos for the new bosses send the wrong message to millions of loyal members, customers and staff,' he said. Last week Barclays and state-backed Lloyds came under fire for rewarding senior executives in the wake of mis-selling scandals and plunging profits. Both banks were criticised for pushing through rewards that jar with attempts to curb financial largesse, and MPs have previously . condemned the ‘gut-churning’ scale of bonuses as bankers brought the . economy to the brink of meltdown. Barclays’ annual report showed chief . executive Antony Jenkins could be . paid up to a maximum of £7.2million this year, while Lloyds expects to . pay boss Antonio Horta-Osorio a maxium package of £7.8million in 2014. While Jenkins’ package is £1.4million lower than the maximum pay he was . entitled to last year, more of his reward is guaranteed. Barclays recently posted a 32 per cent fall in profit and caused controversy by increasing bonuses by 10 per cent. Jenkins claimed the pay decision was vital to avoid the bank plunging into a ‘death spiral,’ as staff leave. Barclays’ annual report also showed 481 staff were paid £1million or . more last year with eight receiving more than £5million. The lender tried to play this down by pointing out that 57 per cent of . those paid at least £1million were based in America, with only 27 per . cent in the UK. Lloyds is seeking approval from shareholders to be able . to pay key staff bonuses worth 200 per cent of their fixed pay, . following on the heels of Barclays and HSBC. Andrew . Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, said last week: ‘It is . regrettable that a number of banks appear not to have accepted the need . for fundamental reform in this year’s bonus round. ‘The new consensus emerging on pay remains seriously flawed. It will now be up to regulators to do the job.’","Salary increases come as Co-op set to report worst losses in 150 years .

When the world and his dog (and baby and Lego man) has mocked you, the only thing to do is try to laugh it off. David Cameron today ditched the his serious selfie pose to meet Bill Clinton, after spawning hundreds of parodies of his Twitter photo calling Barack Obama. The Prime Minister told actor Patrick Stewart, who posed with a tub of Wet Ones instead of a phone: 'Talking to another US President, this time face to face, not on the phone.' David Cameron tweeted this picture at Sir Patrick Stewart in response to his mockery of his serious phone selfie . Prime Minister David Cameron's selfie was supposed to portray him as a serious statesman with a direct line to the White House . The tweet featuring Mr Clinton was a reference to the derision which greeted a photograph of Mr Cameron speaking on the telephone on Wednesday night. For a man who once warned that 'too many tweets might make a t***', Mr Cameron really should have known better. After President Obama was pictured in the Oval Office on the phone to Vladimir Putin, the Prime Minister tweeted a photograph of himself looking serious as he called the US president from No 10. Mr Cameron wrote: 'I've been speaking to @BarackObama about the situation in Ukraine. We are united in condemnation of Russia's actions.' But his keenness to show he has a direct line to the White House seems to have backfired, with the statesmanlike pose he no doubt hoped would impress the public bringing a torrent of online mockery from celebrities and others. US comic Rob Delaney responded to Mr Cameron's tweet by posting a picture of himself, looking just as serious, holding a toothpaste tube instead of a phone. Delaney, who has more than 900,000 Twitter followers, says to Mr Obama and Mr Cameron: 'Hi guys, I'm on the line now too. Get me up to speed.' Comedian Rob Delaney mocked the British PM by using a tube of toothpaste instead of a telephone . Actor Patrick Stewart joined the conversation, clutching a tube of Wet Ones . Writer Michael Moreno picked up the dog and bone to join the international mockery . Next to join the teasing was Star Trek and X-Men star Sir Patrick Stewart, who posed with a tub of Wet Ones in place of a phone, saying: '@robdelaney @David_Cameron @BarackObama I'm now patched in as well. Sorry for the delay.' One Twitter user, Michael Moreno, held up a dog to his ear and tweeted: 'Ok, guys, thanks for holding.' Another tweet showed Mr Obama on the phone looking bemused with the caption: 'David who?' Other users posted pictures suggesting Mr Cameron was not in fact on the telephone to Mr Obama. Creative tweeters posted pictures of a dog, Batman, Lego figure and even various sex-line workers holding phone handsets to suggest Mr Cameron was calling them instead. Mr Cameron had called President Obama from his Downing Street office on Wednesday night to discuss Russia's incursion into Crimea and the need to deter any further action by President Putin. The Prime Minister's most recent gaffe is not the first time he has been the butt of jokes on Twitter over a distasteful use of a selfie. Last year he was criticised for posing for a selfie with Mr Obama and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at the memorial service honouring the life of Nelson Mandela. The three were criticised as insensitive for taking the photograph, in which they were all shown grinning, at the service in tribute to the former South African president.","PM posted photo on Twitter to show he has direct line to White House .

Margaret Thatcher promoted male MPs based on whether they were good-looking or not, a former minister said yesterday. Jonathan Aitken, who published a biography of the former Prime Minister last year, said she as a ‘surprisingly insecure’ woman who was ‘very influenced by male good looks’. He claimed that the fact that men like Cecil Parkinson - who he said was attractive - did so well in her Cabinet proved his thesis to be true. Good-looking: Jonathan Aitken claims the former Tory leader filled her Cabinet with attractive men . Preference: Mr Aitken said attractive men like Cecil Parkinson (left) and John Moore (right) 'made it' The former MP, who went out with Baroness Thatcher’s daughter Carol for three years, said she also preferred better-looking foreign leaders, such as Francois Mitterand. Mr Aitken told the Independent Bath Literature Festival: ‘If you look closely at some of her promotions in the Cabinet there are quite a few who made it because they were good-looking. 'Cecil Parkinson was one. John Moore. Humphrey Atkins. She liked handsome men.’ Lord Parkinson served as Tory chairman and Trade Secretary before being forced to resign after a sex scandal. Jonathan Aitken said his failed three-year relationship with Mrs Thatcher's daughter Carol meant he did not benefit from the Tory leader's policy . Despite this, she brought him back in 1987 as Energy and then Transport Secretary. Mr Moore was a former Health Secretary once seen as a future leader. Mr Atkinson was Northern Ireland Secretary. Baroness Thatcher’s eye also influenced her foreign policy, said Mr Aitken. ‘She did not like the reptilian [former French President] Giscard d’Estaing but she liked François Mitterrand, who looked like a film star,’ he said. Similarly, her relationship with Ronald Reagan was helped by his appearance. Asked why he had not benefited from . Baroness Thatcher’s policy himself, Mr Aitken cited his failed . three-year relationship with Carol Thatcher. It was not, he said, his ‘greatest career move’ to date the Prime Minister’s daughter. ‘But when you’re young you make all kinds . of mistakes,’ he said. ‘She was definitely angry with me for quite a . long time. But I was also far too cocky for my own good.’ Mr Aitken said that his book, Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality, covers the period when ‘she goes off the rails’ after her resignation. He described the leader as bullying, insufferably rude, hubristic and a bigot who never recovered from leaving 10 Downing Street. ‘She remained pretty bitter for the rest of her life,’ he added.","Former leader's biographer said Cecil Parkinson and John Moore benefited .
