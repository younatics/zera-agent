"By . Bianca London . To kick off festival season in style, Men’s Health challenged three of the UK’s busiest hip-hop musicians to get into peak condition in just four weeks. This year’s Men’s Health Celebrity Six-Pack challengers are Rudimental’s DJ Locksmith, Tinchy Stryder and Lethal Bizzle, who all took on the challenge amidst a month of hectic tours. The amazing transformation of the challengers, unveiled in the Men’s Health August issue, aims to prove that getting into cover model shape doesn’t mean spending all day in the gym - and the magazine wants its readers to know that if they can do it while touring the UK, anyone can. Transformation: This year's Men's Health Celebrity Six-Pack challengers are Rudimental's DJ Locksmith, Lethal Bizzle and Tinchy Stryder, who all took on the challenge amidst a month of hectic tours . Rudimental’s DJ Locksmith embarked on a US tour just as he signed up for the Men’s Health challenge. He . said: 'I’m no angel. A tour is a tour. The challenge was finding the . discipline to train hard and eat well…and stick to clear spirits after . the shows. During the 10-day tour, I think I got drunk twice.' Life as a semi-pro footballer and a new father just as the band made it big meant Locksmith was no stranger to discipline. This . mindset helped him cut an impressive 5 per cent body fat. 'My aim was . to lose fat, bring out my abs and see those lines again,' he said. Bulking up: Hip hop stars, including Tinchy Stryder, embarked on Men's Health Celebrity Six-Pack challenge, which saw Tinchy add 2kg of muscle and carve out defined abs . Finding the time: Rudimental's DJ Locksmith embarked on a US tour just as he signed up for the challenge but managed to lose 5 per cent body fat thanks to his trainer, Esin Eminue . Fed up with being titchy, Tinchy Stryder was determined to add 4 inches to his arms. As he admitted to Men’s Health: 'I’m a small guy so knew I’d have to work hard for decent results.' A plan designed to build bulk helped Tinchy add 2kg of muscle and carve out defined abs. 'I wanted to add strength and a bit of muscle - and of course get a six pack.' Lethal Bizzle’s motivation for the challenge was the chance to adopt a whole new mind-set. He said: 'I work out a lot - that’s never been a problem. But eating properly is hard for me. I knew this challenge would give me the discipline I wanted.' Mass gain: Lethal Bizzle's motivation for the challenge was the chance to adopt a whole new mind-set, which saw him lose 4 inches from his waist and drop 7kg . Experimenting with calorie cycling, fasted cardio and Hugh Jackman’s 16:8 diet - which involves doing all your eating for the day during an eight-hour window and then not eating at all for 16 hours, water permitted - helped Bizzle lose 4 inches from his waist and drop 7kg. Speaking about the results, Men’s Health Editor Toby Wiseman said: 'Four weeks which might not seem long to get into shape but each one of our musicians has achieved incredible physical results by combining Men’s Health science with hip-hop attitude. 'We’re sure that their fans will be able to see the results when they play live this summer.'

"By . Bianca London . Kate Silverton, 43, has welcomed a son into the world. The newsreader gave birth to baby Wilbur, her second child with husband Mike Heron, on June 26. Her agent told MailOnline: 'Kate gave birth to a healthy baby boy - Wilbur Silverton-Heron - on June 26 at 02.53 and is naturally absolutely delighted and enjoying family time at present with her husband Mike, baby Wilbur and her daughter Clemency.' The BBC . journalist had openly admitted her struggle to conceive a second child . with IVF, but recently admitted to Lorraine Kelly that she fell pregnant . naturally after 'moving on' from accepting that she may not fall . pregnant. Delighted: Kate Silverton, 43, gave birth to a healthy baby boy - Wilbur Silverton-Heron - on 26th June . She . appeared on ITV with husband Mike Heron and said: ‘After Clemency, I . said to Mike: “I’d love to go through that experience again.” I did . become pregnant, but sadly miscarried at six weeks. Then a few months . later I fell pregnant again.’ When she fell pregnant, the . newsreader told the Daily Mail: ‘We’re absolutely thrilled. It came as a . complete surprise. Nobody else could believe it either. We feel really, . really blessed. I’m still getting my head round it.’ When . Clemency was born in November 2011, Miss Silverton - who lost an ovary . during an operation to remove a cyst when she was 29 - had already been . through four rounds of IVF treatment and had resigned herself to the . fact she was unlikely to become a mother. But within months of stopping the treatment she conceived naturally and later described the pregnancy as a ‘miracle’. Announcing the news: Kate took to Twitter to introduce her new baby, writing: 'Gorgeous morning all - Introducing #Wilbur our little ray of sunshine x' The . BBC presenter was happy to reveal her new baby was also conceived . naturally, saying: ‘I had no wish to go down the IVF route again after . all those years. It was an utterly gruelling process. I was resigned to . thinking ‘what will be, will be’. ‘My husband and I had pretty much given up the idea of me falling pregnant again after Clemency. ‘We . knew how extremely lucky we were to have had her and we had come to . terms with that being our family. I think probably I had a tiny, tiny . glimmer of hope that it would happen. ‘So many doctors have told me “It isn’t going to happen, you have less than a two per cent chance of conceiving”.’ Birth: Kate, pictured pregnant with her daughter, now two, and husband Michael Heron, said she had no wish to go down the IVF route again after all those years . 'I’m a 43-year-old woman who has one ovary, and who has very, very few eggs. The odds were stacked against me.’ Miss . Silverton said she is still unsure how she has managed to conceive . again, but said experts had told her the fact she stayed ‘happy, healthy . and positive’ - in part through several months of visiting an . acupuncturist - may have helped.","Kate, 43, gave birth to Wilbur  Silverton-Heron on June 26 at 02.53 .

"By . Jenny Hope . Foreign doctors who want to work in the UK should be required to get better exam results to ensure patient safety, researchers are urging. To practise in the UK, doctors currently have to pass exams testing their medical knowledge and English language skills. But the study concluded that the pass mark is set too low – and insisted that foreign doctors who pass are not up to the same standard as newly-trained doctors in Britain. Researchers claim foreign doctors who pass are not up to the same standard as newly-trained doctors in Britain (file picture) Researchers at University College London and the University of Cambridge found the international graduates got substantially lower marks in exams for would-be GPs and physicians. Foreign doctors must pass an English language test and the General Medical Council's Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board (PLAB) test, designed to ensure that overseas doctors demonstrate the same level of medical knowledge and clinical skills as UK graduates who have completed their first foundation training year. The researchers compared the results of these two tests to the performance of UK graduates taking exams set by the Royal Colleges of Physicians and the Royal College of General Practitioners. They said that raising the exam pass mark 'considerably' – by up to 20 per cent – would ensure both sets of doctors were of a similar standard. But they also warned this would cut the pass rate and could cause a shortage of candidates for the NHS, which is heavily reliant on foreign medical staff. To practise in the UK, doctors currently have to pass exams testing their medical knowledge and English language skills (file picture) The number of patients on NHS waiting lists is at its highest for nearly six years. There are now 2.89million awaiting surgery or other hospital procedures, including nearly 550 who have been waiting for more than a year. Official figures also show that, for the first time since March 2011, the NHS has missed a crucial target that patients should be treated within 18 weeks. The health service is meant to ensure that at least 90 per cent are treated within this time but the figure fell to 89.9 per cent in February, meaning that around 400 waited longer. Labour warned that the NHS was heading back to the 'bad old days' when hundreds of thousands of patients waited up to two years for treatment. Its health spokesman, Andrew Gwynne, said: 'Under David Cameron, waiting lists for operations are at their longest in years.' Around one in three doctors registered with the GMC qualified in other countries, with 27 per cent obtaining their medical degree from outside the European Economic Area. Concerns over the abilities of foreign-trained doctors were brought to the fore by the death of 70-year-old retired engineer David Gray in 2008. He was given ten times the normal dose of diamorphine by German locum Dr Daniel Ubani. Nigerian-born Dr Ubani had snatched just a few hours of sleep after flying in from Germany to work his first shift for a private out-of-hours firm. Writing on the medical website bmj.com, the researchers said  the move could create 'severe workforce planning challenges' for the NHS. But they insisted that raising the standard of the exam was 'fundamental to ensuring the quality of postgraduate medical education and training, the delivery of medical care of the highest quality, and thus ensuring patient safety in the NHS'. In a separate study, Durham University researchers compared postgraduate performance between international and UK medical graduates – and found that the UK graduates did better in later exams. Dr Paul Tiffin, a senior lecturer Durham's School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health, said: 'Further research is needed to understand the potential reasons for these differences in performance, and in particular, the possible role that language and culture may play.' He added: 'There may be better ways of supporting overseas doctors to adjust to UK culture, and that of the health service more quickly.' Professor John McLachlan, co-director of  the Centre for Medical Education Research at Durham, said: 'It is important to appreciate that from patients' points of view, cultural differences are not absolutes. 'For instance, a doctor from a particular cultural background may be able to provide particularly valuable care to patients from the same background.'","Researchers concluded that the pass mark is set too low .

"By . Harriet Hernando . An ex-soldier was brought back from the brink of death by his pet dogs. Billy Malone, 66, collapsed at his home in Llanfairfechan, North Wales, and banged his head on a radiator knocking himself out. But his pet terrier Rocky and Rhodesian Ridgeback Copa came to the rescue and managed to wake Mr Malone up by licking his face. Former soldier Billy Malone, 66, is recovering in Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor, Wales, after collapsing and knocking himself out . Man's best friend: Mr Malone's pet terrier Rocky (left) and Rhodesian Ridgeback Copa (right) managed to wake their owner by licking him after he fell unconscious, so he was able to call for help . The Royal Signals veteran, who was alone at the time, managed to call for help and paramedics who arrived on the scene said he probably would not have survived had the dogs not woken him up. He was suffering from internal bleeding, caused by tearing a vein in his stomach after coughing the previous week. Mr Malone, who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, called his wife Kathy who rushed back home. She said: 'After falling and passing out, Billy remembers the dogs nudgeing him and licking him. He remembers trying to tell them off, but they carried on. Billy started to crawl to the phone in the living room but kept passing out. Thankfully the dogs kept on nudging and licking and bringing him round again.' Kathy Malone with husband Billy who collapsed after suffering from severe internal bleeding . Billy was taken by ambulance to Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor where he is now recovering. Mrs Malone said : 'If the dogs hadn’t been here pestering him, he would have died. All the blood had drained and he had swelling the size of a football. He’d had a cough the week before which had torn a vein in his stomach muscle lining.' She praised Rocky the eleven-year-old terrier and Copa, a Rhodesian ridgeback, who is two, who proved that dogs really are man’s best friend.","Billy Malone, 66, banged his head on a radiator and passed out when he was home alone .

"By . Jenny Hope . High blood pressure is the UK's biggest silent killer; affecting 16million people in the UK . At least one in four people with high blood pressure have abandoned their medication or take too little to combat their higher risk of heart problems, warn researchers. A new study shows ‘alarmingly high levels’ of patients failing to take prescribed drugs, which may lead to them needing costly further treatment. High blood pressure is the UK’s biggest silent killer; affecting 16million people in the UK, with many taking drugs. It is estimated more than 120,000 heart attacks and strokes a year in the UK could be avoided if people lowered their blood pressure. Experts are calling for wider use of a simple test to determine whether patients are taking their pills, or if they are not working. A study team from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and the University of Leicester used the test to analyse urine samples from 208 patients with high blood pressure attending a specialist clinic. They had poor control of their condition or resistant hypertension, which meant they appeared not to be responding to drugs. Of the group, 125 were new patients sent by their GP, 66 had poor blood pressure control and 17 had been referred for renal denervation, a kidney procedure to lower blood pressure when other methods have failed. The tests showed one-quarter of patients either did not take their tablets at all or only occasionally - with 10 per cent not taking any tablets and 15 per cent just some of the time. Patients with poor blood pressure control were least likely to stick to their medicines regime, along with those referred for the kidney procedure. The less likely people were to take their medicines, the higher their blood pressure readings, says a report in the journal Heart. The team said most patients with hypertension referred for extra hospital care ‘would routinely undergo many additional tests and procedures’ in a bid to find out why the drugs weren’t working. Recent guidance from the National . Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggested between a . third and a half of medicines prescribed for long-term conditions are . not used as recommended. Professor . Morris Brown, of the Clinical Pharmacology Unit at the University of . Cambridge, in an editorial, said patients failing to take blood pressure . drugs was a particular problem because they usually had no symptoms. It is estimated that more than 120,000 heart attacks and strokes a year in the UK could be avoided if people lowered their blood pressure (file picture, posed by model) He said it was a ‘shock’ that 23 per cent of those referred for the kidney procedure had no detectable drug in their system, potentially wasting NHS resources. Analysing urine samples could ‘solve at a stroke the problem of monitoring adherence and should rapidly transform practice’, he added. Doireann Maddock, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said ‘Although this is a small study, it highlights a big problem. ‘High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart and circulatory disease. ‘Not taking prescribed meds means blood pressure levels are uncontrolled, which could increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. ‘If you’re thinking about stopping your medication because you’re experiencing side effects, make sure you talk to your GP. ‘They will talk things through with you and may suggest changes to your meds, which could help resolve the issue.’ A high blood pressure reading is one that exceeds 140/90 millimetres of mercury (mmHg). The first figure, the systolic pressure, corresponds to the ‘surge’ that occurs with each heart beat while the diastolic reading is the pressure in the ‘resting’ stage between beats. If readings are consistently at 140/90 or above, high blood pressure is diagnosed.","High blood pressure is UK's biggest silent killer; affecting 16million people .

"By . Jenny Hope . Deaths from liver disease have soared by 40 per cent in a decade and will continue to rise because of heavy drinking and unhealthy eating, a report warns today. Liver disease kills 11,000 a year in England despite the fact that major causes such as alcohol misuse and obesity are preventable, it says. Figures show that a third of sufferers have obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  Alcoholic liver disease is also responsible for two in three of all alcohol-related deaths. Scroll down for video . Deadly drink: Alcoholic liver disease is responsible for two in three of all alcohol-related deaths, figures show . The report by MPs from the All-Party Parliamentary Hepatology Group calls on the Government to address the ‘catastrophic consequences’ of the rising death toll. It accused NHS England of ditching plans to produce a strategy for tackling liver disease after three years of work by experts and charities. Tory MP David Amess, who chairs the group, said the report is ‘a wake-up call for the nation’. He added: ‘Liver disease is the only one of the UK’s top five causes of death where death rates  continue to rise and there is no national strategy to tackle this. ‘Unless urgent and co-ordinated action is taken now, in less than a generation, liver disease has  the potential to be the UK’s biggest killer. As most liver disease can be prevented, this is a tragic waste of life.’ The three main causes of liver disease – alcohol misuse, obesity and viral hepatitis – are preventable and if detected early most cases are also treatable, says the report. It adds that deaths from liver disease are steadily increasing in the UK, while dropping among our European neighbours. ‘Even more disturbing is the fact that the average age of death from liver disease is only 59 and continuing to fall,’ it says. Easily preventable: Figures show that a third of sufferers have obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . In addition, an estimated 216,000 people in the UK are infected with hepatitis C, which can also cause liver disease. However, there is a ‘postcode  lottery’ for liver disease services in the NHS, with ‘vastly differing standards of care for patients depending on where they live’. The poorest are more than twice as likely to die from liver disease as the better off, says the report. It recommends a minimum 50p unit price for alcohol and the co-ordination of a national approach to preventing disease as well as ensuring better care and early diagnosis. Action is also needed on obesity and eliminating hepatitis C in the next 15 years, it says. Public health minister Jane Ellison announced in December that NHS England had no plans to publish a liver disease strategy. The British Liver Trust has predicted that spending on combating liver disease will reach £1billion a year within the next decade. Andrew Langford, chief executive of the trust, said: ‘Liver disease is a national scandal and more must be done to prevent, diagnose and treat the condition. ‘We cannot sit by and allow so much needless suffering and death. We need decisive action now.’ Charles Gore, chief executive of the Hepatitis C Trust, said: ‘There is so much more that could be done to prevent the escalating death toll from liver disease. For example, only 3 per cent of hepatitis C patients receive potentially life-saving treatment each year. With the new treatments, we could effectively eliminate the virus in the UK within a generation. ‘The Government, Public Health England and all parts of the NHS urgently need to prioritise action on the causes of liver disease.’ The Department of Health said: ‘Eating too much and drinking too much alcohol over time can do terrible damage to the liver. ‘This is why the Government is taking comprehensive action to tackle the issue, through alcohol risk assessments at GPs, access to alcohol liaison nurses in hospitals and working with industry to help reduce fat and sugar in foods and to remove a billion units of alcohol from sale. ‘We have given local authorities the power, freedom and the funding to tackle the public health issues – such as obesity – that blight their local areas.’","A third of liver disease sufferers develop the illness through obesity .

"By . Jenny Hope . Jeremy Hunt has performed a complete U-turn on the legislation regarding infant vaccinations, saying now that children young enough will be covered by the meningitis B vaccine . Babies could receive the new meningitis B vaccine as soon as this summer and it could also be extended  to teenagers. In a Government U-turn, infants aged two months will be vaccinated on the NHS if costs with the manufacturer can be agreed. And research will be carried out which could lead to teenagers also receiving the vaccine. Britain has one of the highest meningitis B rates in the world – affecting on average 1,870 people each year. The disease can kill within hours. Children under five and teenagers are most at risk. It kills more under-fives than any other infectious disease in the UK. The Department of Health’s U-turn on providing the vaccine on the NHS comes in the wake of intense pressure from charities and senior doctors on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. The vaccine, known as Bexsero and made by Novartis, is the first to protect against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis. But last July, the committee said it was not cost-effective ‘at any price’ and could not be recommended for use on the NHS. Thousands of campaigners petitioned the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urging them to ensure it was approved. In October, the committee said it was considering new evidence and a range of views. The vaccine was licensed for use in January last year and the committee figures suggest that since then, at least 200 people in Britain were killed by meningitis B or suffered serious after-effects. Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer at the Department of Health, said: ‘Infants under one year of age are most at risk of meningitis B and the number of cases peak at around five or six months of age. Since the meningitis B vaccine was created last year at least 200 people in Britain were killed by meningitis B or suffered serious after-effects . ‘With early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, most make a full recovery. ‘But it is fatal in about one in ten cases and can lead to long-term health problems such as amputation, deafness, epilepsy and learning difficulties. ‘We will now be working closely with Novartis in the coming months and, if negotiations are successful, we hope to work with the other UK health departments to introduce a vaccine to prevent meningitis B as quickly as possible. ‘This would make the UK the first country in the world to implement a nationwide vaccination programme.’ Andrin Oswald, division head at Novartis Vaccines, said the company will work with the Department of Health to get the vaccine to babies as early as this summer. ‘At Novartis, it took us more than 20 years of hard work to get to this point,’ he said. The joint committee has recommended infants are immunised from two months of age – having three jabs in total – and that there is a one-off catch-up programme for babies aged three and four months when it is introduced. The committee has also recommended a pilot programme vaccinating teenagers to see whether it reduces the level of bacteria carried in the nose, which can trigger meningitis in this age group. Campaigners claim that, in extreme cases, the cost of treating and supporting each survivor of meningitis is £3million. Statistics show that between 2008 and 2012, £28million was paid in compensation to the families of children left permanently disabled by meningitis which GPs had not spotted.","U-turn: infants aged two months will be vaccinated on the NHS .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . At its largest, the Roman Empire stretched across the length and breadth of UK, Europe and beyond covering a staggering 1,061,780 square miles (2,750,000 square km). But its size was can also be attributed to its downfall as managing such a large expanse of land proved costly and time consuming. To put this expanse into perspective, historians have created the interactive 'Orbis: The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World' that lets you explore the Empire, and see how long it would have taken - and how much it would have cost - to travel the world in 200 CE. Try out the interactive map below . The map of the Roman world was created by Walter Scheidel, an historian in the Classics and History Departments at Stanford. It features 632 sites including urban settlements and mountain passes, and covers close to 4 million square miles (10 million square km) of land and sea. Google Maps now lets users measure the exact distance between two or more points on a map. Previously, Google Maps displayed distances when searching for directions, but it would only reveal the distance along the planned route - 'as the crow flies.' This means it would draw a straight line from one point to another to reveal the distance. Now, desktop users will see the exact distances between two or more points, which will be useful for runners or cyclists for example. To use the new tool, travellers can right-click on the map and select Measure distance. The map reveals how much it would have cost to travel on roads and seas across the Roman Empire in 200 CE, and calculates the route based on the season or mode of transport chosen. For example, travelling from Londinium to Roma in July would have taken 21 days, covering 1,642 miles (2643km). Prices in denarii would have been 1031.23 per passenger. Denarius was a small silver coin used by the Romans. Its name is the origin of several modern words such as the currency name dinar, and the Italian common noun for money, denaro. An unskilled labourer would have received a denarius for a day's work, for example. Map modes include travelling by foot, horses, relay, oxcart, porter, private chariot, and during a rapid military march. Start and end points of routes can be selected using drop-down menus, and users can even select what season they travel in. Elsewhere, travellers can select between the fastest, cheapest, and shortest routes and whether they want to exclude roads, rivers, coastal or open seas. Once all the options have been selected, the Calculate Route button shows the results. These appear as text in the bottom left-hand corner, a longitude and latitude graph along the bottom, and a node route on top of the map. The Display options in the top right-hand corner lets users remove, or show, terrain details, sites, names, paths and regions. Additionally, there is a video tutorial that teaches users how to navigate around the map. Although it broadly reflects conditions around 200 CE, it also covers a sites and roads created in late antiquity. A total of 301 sites serve as sea ports. The baseline road network covers 52,587 miles (84,631 km) of road or desert tracks, in addition to 17,567 miles (28,272 km) of navigable rivers and canals (pictured) Modes include travelling by foot, horses, relay, oxcart, porter, private chariot, (stock image pictured left) and during a rapid military march.

Their total length, which would have varied monthly due to the changing conditions, averages at 119,806 miles (192,810 km).

"By . Jenny Hope . You're never too old to play  Nintendo Wii-Fit – because it helps keep older people on their feet, claim researchers. Those prone to falling have most to gain from the popular computer game console, which simulates sports such as tennis, bowling and boxing. A study shows it benefits those too frail to take part in conventional physiotherapy because they are not strong or fit enough. They tried to make me go to rehab: Playing a Nintendo Wii Fit takes 30 per cent less energy than physio, while improving balance and coordination . Playing Wii-Fit games uses 30 per cent less energy than physio treatment, but improves the balance and co-ordination needed to avoid falls. Researchers Dr Murray Griffin and Dr Matt Taylor, from the School of Biological Sciences at Essex University, studied 20 pensioners who had suffered heart problems. Keeping active: Nintento Wii . In the study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, the volunteers used a Wii-Fit balance board to play co-ordination and ski jump games. Talking about the finding that the volunteers used less energy, Dr Griffin said: ‘This offers a real hope to some of the most vulnerable and elderly people in society whose frailty seriously impacts on their quality of life.’ Recurrent fallers cost the NHS nearly £1.7billion a year in hospital admissions and long-term care costs. Not only can it cause broken bones and other physical damage, fallers are often left feeling anxious and less likely to move about. This can have a negative effect on their quality of life and lead to depression. It is thought the effect of Wii exercise on the brain may be similar to real exercise, which can boost levels of the feelgood chemical dopamine.","Using a Nintendo Wii Fit can help elderly  people avoid falling over .

"By . Associated Press . and Alexandra Klausner . A vacant luxury house appears on the verge of tumbling 75 feet into a Central Texas lake because a cliff is collapsing beneath the property. WFAA-TV in Dallas-Fort Worth reported Wednesday that the 4,000 square-foot-home above Lake Whitney has been condemned and the owners evacuated about two weeks ago. Hill County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Mark Wilson says another chunk of cliff broke off on Tuesday night. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . About to drop? A luxury house teeters on a cliff about 75 feet above Lake Whitney in Whitney, Texas where homeowners have been forced to evacuate and watch their $700,000 mansion crumble . The 4,000 square-foot-home was condemned a year ago after people noticed a crack in the cliff below about a year ago . Soil and other debris have been falling from beneath the home at White Bluff Resort, some 60 miles south of Fort Worth. Tax records show the house was built in 2007 and is worth more than $700,000. Neighbors Connie Ash and Jackie McNamara live across the lake and told reporters that they heard a cliff crash into the water at around 6:30 p.m yesterday. 'I immediately thought it was an earthquake or blasting; it was loud, really loud,' said Connie Ash said. 'And then I saw smoke, dust, water... I don't know, it was a huge cloud of stuff.' 'You used to look flush at the roof but then I could see it was somewhat down,' she said. 'You could see it... more and more of the top of the house that's moved. You're looking through the binoculars, just watching it.' WFAA-TV published aerial photos of the home which show a massive hole under the center of the house. Huge fissures could also be seen on a nearby cliff. A sign reading, 'EXTREME DANGER, STAY OFF PREMISES,' greeted visitors in the front yard. The Hill County Sheriff said that people noticed a crack in the cliff about a year ago and that afterwards the house was condemned. The owners of the crumbling mansion evacuated two weeks ago and they've moved all their things out. The Sheriff told reporters that the home was shifting quickly on Tuesday night and there's no knowing is the house will fall down with it. Soil and Debris can be seen hanging from the nearly dilapidated luxury home. Despite not being able to live in the home, the owners will be responsible for the clean-up.

"By . Jenny Hope . Welsh cancer patients are flooding into English hospitals for treatment they are being denied at home. The number crossing the border has quadrupled from just 3,471 a decade ago to 15,450 last year. The exodus is fuelled by a lack of access to the National Cancer Drugs Fund, which funds treatments rejected by the NHS or awaiting approval. And almost 50 per cent of Welsh patients must wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests compared with a 1 per cent figure in England. Delays: Fifty times more Welsh patients than English face long waits for potentially life-saving cancer scans . It is thought that many more cross-border patients do not show up in the official statistics because they have moved to England permanently or use a second address. Simon Burns, the Tory MP who obtained the figures through a parliamentary question, said they were an indictment of the Labour-controlled Welsh Assembly. ‘This has been the result of the serious problems in the way the health service in Wales is run by the Labour administration,’ he said. ‘This is the latest scandal showing the disparity in care after the waiting times were shown to be appalling. ‘It’s all very well having free prescriptions in Wales, but people would rather be treated more quickly and get the drugs they need. I’m worried that this is the kind of service we can expect if Labour win the election.’ In addition to the cancer patients, 5,419 people from Wales came to England for outpatient diagnostics in 2009-10. This had risen to 10,424 by 2012-13. The Royal College of Surgeons has raised concerns over Welsh waiting lists, highlighting the cases of 152 patients who have died in the past five years waiting for operations. Surge: Almost 16,000 people a year are now crossing the border to access the English NHS . Welsh patients can be referred to English hospitals by their GP but otherwise must have an English address to get treatment. They wait considerably longer in A&E and Wales has repeatedly missed the target that 95 per cent of patients should be seen within four hours. In January a 58-year-old man died after waiting four hours in an ambulance outside the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend because there was no room. Hospitals in Wales also have higher death rates although the exact figures are not known and the Welsh administration claims they cannot be compared with those in England. Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of England, has called for an investigation. GPs in Wales normally refer cancer patients to local services but can go out of the area – and to England – for specialist care. The GP making the referral will pay for the services their patient receives, allowing them to purchase cancer treatment from an English provider by agreement. If a GP will not or cannot make a referral for treatment in England a patient can take matters into their own hands and ‘find’ an address in England. The address - rented, owned or through staying with family, is then used to register with a GP in England. Once accepted and registered with a GP, the patient will have access to the services that doctor commissions and pays for in the same way any English patient might. Such a patient should be registered with only one GP and would have to de-register from their Welsh doctor before switching. Andrew Wilson, of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, said: ‘Given the inequality in access to cancer treatments, it is little surprise that Welsh patients are being forced to travel to England for the treatment they need. ‘It is a national scandal that Welsh patients are not able to benefit from treatments that are routinely available in England. ‘The Welsh Assembly Government needs to take urgent action to prevent Welsh cancer services falling further behind.’ Last summer the foundation found that in England an average of 29 patients were given new drugs for every 100,000 of the population. In Wales it was just 7 per 100,000. The long waiting times in Wales have been highlighted by Ann Clwyd, Labour MP for Cynon Valley. Miss Clwyd has accused University Hospital Wales of treating her husband Owen Roberts ‘like a battery hen’ prior to his death in October 2012. Miss Clwyd has received numerous letters from Welsh patients who felt forced to pay for private tests to avoid long waits. Others said they had had to use English hospitals. NHS Wales last month announced a review of the way it deals with NHS complaints. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ‘The [parliamentary] figures represent a small amount of the total cancer activity for patients living in Wales. The vast majority receive treatment in Wales; there were around 141,000 admission episodes for a primary diagnosis of cancer for Welsh residents in Wales in 2012-13. ‘There will be very strong clinical reasons why a patient will need to be treated in England. ‘What remains most important, as set out in our Cancer Delivery Plan, is that Welsh patients receive treatment based on individual need.’ Over the past three years the National Cancer Drugs Fund has given almost 50,000 cancer patients in England access to life-prolonging drugs. Registered in London: Annie Mulholland is signed up to a London GP which allows her to access better treatment . Annie Mulholland has spent all her adult life in Wales but switched addresses to England to get a potentially life-saving cancer drug. The ovarian cancer sufferer says a postcode lottery in Wales stopped her having Avastin. She registered with a GP in London last year after ‘finding’ an address as a base in England. That resulted in her being prescribed the drug and the 61-year-old from Cardiff was given the ‘wonderful’ news this week that she is in remission. But Mrs Mulholland, who runs a support group for ovarian cancer sufferers, says many women in Wales have not had her luck. ‘I have nothing but praise for my GP in Wales and NHS staff but they are often not able to prescribe treatments available in England and it affects the care they can give,’ she said. ‘Funding is patchy, there’s a postcode lottery. ‘I decided to become a permanent visitor in Wales and an absent resident in London to get the hospital, and treatment, I wanted. Anyone in Wales can do what I’ve done.’","A decade ago 3,471 crossed the border for treatment, now it is 15,450 .

"By . Jenny Hope . Statins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects on the nervous system. Previous research using simvastatin in people with early-stage MS found reductions in brain lesions, suggesting the statin was affecting the disease process. British researchers randomly assigned 140 patients with secondary progressive MS to receive either 80mg of simvastatin (costing £2 a month) or placebo (dummy pill) for two years. Previous research using simvastatin in people with early-stage MS found reductions in brain lesions, suggesting the statin was affecting the disease process . Brain MRI scans showed a reduction in the average atrophy rate to 0.3 per cent a year with simvastatin, a 43 per cent reduction (when adjusted for factors such as age and gender) compared with placebo. Small but significant improvements in disability were noted by doctors and patients, while serious adverse events were similar between the two groups. Small but significant improvements in disability were noted by doctors and patients . Study leader Dr Jeremy Chataway of University College London Hospitals, said ‘In the progressive stage of MS the brain shrinks by about 0.6 per cent a year. Our main measure of success was to reduce the rate of brain atrophy.’ ‘Caution should be taken regarding over-interpretation of our brain imaging findings, because these might not necessarily translate into clinical benefit. ‘However, our promising results warrant further investigation in larger phase 3 disability-driven trials.’ Professor John Greenwood at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, who has investigated the possible benefits of statins in autoimmune diseases such as MS and uveitism, said: ‘After nearly two decades of research, it is immensely gratifying to see this work progress into the clinic to deliver benefits to patients.’ Dr Susan Kohlhaas, head of biomedical research at the MS Society, said: ‘There are no treatments that can stop the condition from worsening in people with progressive MS. ‘Scientists have worked for years to find a potential treatment that could help people, and now, finally, one has been found. This is very exciting news. ‘Further, larger clinical trials are now absolutely crucial to confirm the safety and effectiveness of this treatment, but for now, people with MS should be really encouraged by these results.’","British researchers randomly assigned 140 patients with secondary progressive MS to recieve either 80mg of simvastatin or a placebo .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . They look good enough to hang in a gallery, but each of these stunning images is smaller than the width of a human hair. Scientists created them using a breakthrough imaging technique that ‘draws’ pictures on materials using particles and atoms. As well as being beautiful images, they are extremely high-resolution and could pave the way for ultra-thin flexible displays. The breakthrough material was created by Oxford University scientists who realised they could electrically switch 'nano-pixels' - just 300 by 300 nanometres in size - on and off to create coloured dots. Pictured is an image of a tiger that is smaller than the width of a human hair . The system relies on ‘nano-pixels’ just 300 nanometres across that can be electrically turned on or off to create a mosaic of coloured dots on a display. A team led by Oxford University . scientists explored the link between the electrical and optical . properties of phase change materials - materials that can change from flowing to a crystalline state. They . discovered that by sandwiching a seven nanometre thick layer of this material between two layers of a transparent electrode . they could use a tiny current to 'draw' images. Initially still . images were created using an atomic force microscope, but the team went . on to demonstrate that such tiny 'stacks' can be turned into prototype . pixel-like devices. These . 'nano-pixels' - just 300 by 300 nanometres in size – can be electrically . switched on and off at will. This creates tiny coloured dots that could be . used on an extremely high-resolution displays. The layers of the material are . created using a sputtering technique where high energy particles are . fired on the material at a certain point. These atoms are then transferred onto another material as a thin film. A report of the research is published in this week's Nature. By comparison, the width of a human hair is approximately 80,000 to 100,000 nanometres wide. This is done by sending tiny currents through layers of ‘phase changing’ material, that can switch from a flowing to a crystalline state. The discovery makes it possible to create images just a few hundred nanometres across. By creating such tiny pixels, this means images could be shown on extremely high-resolution and low-energy thin, flexible displays. Such displays could be used in smart glasses, synthetic retinas, and foldable screens. 'We didn't set out to invent a new kind of display,' said Professor Harish Bhaskaran of Oxford University's Department of Materials, who led the research. 'We were exploring the relationship between the electrical and optical properties of phase change materials and then had the idea of creating this 'sandwich' made up of layers just a few nanometres thick. ‘We found that not only were we able to create images in the stack but, to our surprise, thinner layers of GST actually gave us better contrast. Researchers discovered that by sandwiching a seven nanometre thick layer of phase change material - a material that can switch between flowing and crystallised - between two layers of a transparent electrode they could use a tiny current to 'draw' images (pictured) The discovery makes it possible to create images just a few hundred nanometres across, that could pave the way for high-resolution and low-energy, flexible displays for applications such as synthetic retinas, and foldable screens (pictured). The Oxford team has filed a patent on the discovery with the help of Isis Innovation . ‘We also discovered that altering the size of the bottom electrode layer enabled us to change the colour of the image.' Although the work is still in its early stages, the Oxford team has filed a patent on the discovery with the help of Isis Innovation, Oxford University's technology commercialisation company. Isis is now discussing the displays with companies who are interested in assessing the technology, and with investors. The layers of the GST sandwich are created using a sputtering technique where high energy particles are fired on the material at a certain point. Initially, still images were created using an atomic force microscope, but the team went on to demonstrate that such tiny 'stacks' could be turned into prototype pixel-like devices. Researchers said that not only were they able to create images (pictured) in the stack but, the thinner layers of material produced a better contrast . The team has already demonstrated that the technique works on flexible Mylar sheets around 200 nanometres thick. The prototype pixels can also be tuned to create any colour we want - including the primary colours needed for a display. Pictured is a image of a Fiat Cinquecento drawn using nano-pixels . These atoms are then transferred onto another material as a thin film. The phase change material used was the . alloy Ge2Sb2Te5 (Germanium-Antimony-Tellurium or GST) sandwiched between . electrode layers made of indium tin oxide (ITO). 'Because the layers that make up our devices can be deposited as thin films they can be incorporated into very thin flexible materials – we have already demonstrated that the technique works on flexible Mylar sheets around 200 nanometres thick,' said Professor Bhaskaran. 'This makes them potentially useful for 'smart' glasses, foldable screens, windshield displays, and even synthetic retinas that mimic the abilities of photoreceptor cells in the human eye.' Professor Peiman Hosseini of Oxford University's Department of Materials said: 'Our models are so good at predicting the experiment that we can tune our prototype 'pixels' to create any colour we want – including the primary colours needed for a display. The research suggests that flexible paper-thin displays based on the technology could also have the capacity to switch between a power-saving 'colour e-reader mode', and a backlit display capable of showing video. Wave image pictured . ‘One of the advantages of our design is that, unlike most conventional LCD screens, there would be no need to constantly refresh all pixels, you would only have to refresh those pixels that actually change - static pixels remain as they were. ‘This means that any display based on this technology would have extremely low energy consumption.' The research suggests that flexible paper-thin displays based on the technology could have the capacity to switch between a power-saving 'colour e-reader mode', and a backlit display capable of showing video. Such displays could also be created using cheap materials. Co-author Professor David Wright of the . Department of Engineering at the University of Exeter added: 'Along with . many other researchers around the world we have been looking into the . use of these GST materials for memory applications for many years, but . no one before thought of combining their electrical and optical . functionality to provide entirely new kinds of high-resolution, . electronic colour displays – so our work is a real breakthrough.'

"By . Jenny Hope . Death rates from breast cancer in Britain have fallen the most – and at the fastest rate – across Europe in the last two decades. The drop of up to 41 per cent was hailed as ‘spectacular’ and will be an enormous morale-booster for women fighting the disease who now have their best chance of beating it. Although experts point to better treatments and NHS care, the improvements are marked because British patients started with the worst odds of survival. Death rates from breast cancer in Britain have fallen the most and at the fastest rate across Europe in the last two decades . In 1987-9, breast cancer mortality rates in England and Wales were the highest in Europe at 41.9 per 100,000 women. Latest data reveals that by 2008-2010, the figure was down to 25.4 per 100,000 – a drop of 40.8 per cent. The plummeting levels represent the biggest fall of any European country from 1989 to 2010 and include patients under 50 who often suffer more aggressive cancers. The second highest fall was in Scotland, which had a 37.9 per cent cut in rates, followed by Northern Ireland with a 33.5 per cent decrease. Mortality rates were 25.1 per 100,000 women in Scotland in 2010 and 25.6 in Northern Ireland, meaning the UK is on a par with the best in Europe. The plummeting levels represent the biggest fall of any European country from 1989 to 2010 . Professor Philippe Autier presented the findings at the European Breast Cancer Conference in Glasgow, saying his figures showed England and Wales were ‘best in class’. He said: ‘The drop in the UK is really spectacular and it’s now close to all groups of other countries.’ The expert, of the International Prevention Research Institute in Lyon, France, said his research shows how the improvement in the UK has gathered pace. ‘The other very good news is that we were thinking that the decrease would level off, or stabilise but there has been an acceleration,’ he added. ‘There is no limit that we can see.’ The fall in death rates was around one per cent a year from the early 1990s but was nearly two per cent annually more recently. Prof Autier said he hoped that by 2060 ‘only the most complex cases would prove fatal’. Although the number of breast  cancer cases continues to rise, reaching around 50,000 a year, the current death toll of almost 12,000 is much lower than two decades ago, he added. Prof Autier attributed the ‘dramatic’ change to better treatments, better awareness among women and health professionals, and better organisation within the NHS. However, he added, the fall in deaths would not have been possible  without advances in drugs and other treatments. New, more effective drugs and the growing availability of multi-disciplinary treatments should encourage a further downward trend in deaths from breast cancer, he predicted. In 1987-9, Romania had Europe’s lowest death rates, at 20 per 100,000. However, by 2008-2010, the country was recording 22 per 100,000, meaning mortality levels have risen. The figures also show France was one of the worst performing countries over the last 20 years, with a cut of only 17 per cent in death rates. It had the lowest reduction of any European country in death rates of women under 50. Prof Autier said ‘there is something going on here that we don’t understand’ as France devotes substantial resources to cancer care and women there have access to the best treatment. But screening has failed to make an impact in countries like the UK as it did not detect deadly cancers at an earlier stage, he added. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘By continuing to invest in vital research, we will be able to overcome breast cancer by 2050.’ Dr Richard Francis, research manager at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said routine access to new treatments is vital to cutting death rates. He added: ‘Breast cancer is not yesterday’s problem – one woman is diagnosed every ten minutes.’","The drop of up to 41 per cent was hailed as ‘spectacular’

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A three-year-old boy from Virginia accidentally shot and wounded his twin brother on Monday morning after handling an unattended firearm in his mother's home. The three-year-old who was shot is in critical condition at VCU Medical center after a .25 caliber bullet went through his bottom and into his abdomen after his mother rushed him to the hospital. The young shooter, also injured, was taken to his mother's boyfriend's other girlfriend's house. The twins' mother Reashonda Jones, 28, along with her boyfriend Lewis Walter Jones, 29, who sometimes goes by the first names 'Masson' or 'Smoke' are deemed fugitives. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Reashonda Jones (left) and her boyfriend Lewis Walter Jones (right) are on the run from police after Reashonda's three-year-old baby accidentally shot his twin brother . The tragic shooting occurred at the housing project in Hopewell, Virginia off 8th street where the family live . Lewis . Walter Jones allegedly took the twin who shot his brother to his other . girlfriend's house at Fourth and Poythress Streets and thereby captured a witness to a crime. 'He . was taking a potential witness. Even though they’re only three, it’s . potentially obstruction of justice,'said CBS-6 legal analyst Todd Stone. 'You have a lot of issues at play.' According to wanted posters emailed from The Hopewell Police Department to The Mail Online, Reashonda is wanted for Possession of a Firearm by a convicted Felon, Filing a False Police Report, and Felony Child Neglect. Lewis Walter is wanted for Felony Child Neglect, Obstruction of Justice, and Evidence Tampering. Hopewell Police Chief John Keohane said that there are several conflicting versions of the story following the shooting. Cops originally thought that the shooting might have occurred in the playground at the Hopewell project but evidence found in the home trumped that theory . The shooting occurred at the mother's home in a housing project in Hopewell, Virginia . He said that one thing was certain, however. 'There was a child that got his hands on a firearm and used it,' said Keohane. He also said that they boy who 'shot his brother' also had injuries such as potential burns or worse. 'We are not sure if the action of the .25 caught him on the hand as it recycled the round,' said Keohane. Police originally thought that the shooting might have happened in the playground but they later found a . 25 caliber shell casing at the mother's home where the family live. 'In the hood you hear one story but the real story isn’t out yet,' said Joe Marsh, who lives in the housing project. Police were able to collect evidence on Monday along with an impounded car and two guns. Police say that the shooting could have been prevented had the weapon been properly locked and stored. 'It’s matter of inches and this whole thing could’ve changed,' said Keohane. 'It’s disturbing.' Reashonda Sharelle Jones is 5'6"" and weighs 180 pounds. Lewis Walter Jones is 5'6"" and weighs 170 pounds. Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of the fugitives are asked to call 804-541-2202.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A 21-year-old mother from Long Island mysteriously disappeared on Friday night after she went to work and then out with friends. Sarah Patricia Goode, 21, is thought to have gone missing under 'suspicious circumstances,' after police found Goode's 1999 BMW parked a mile away from her house on Fire Avenue near new London Avenue in Medford. Police say the car showed obvious signs of a struggle and a witness said that there appeared to be blood in the vehicle. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Found? Police have found a body in woodland they believe might be Long Island medical technician, Sarah Goode. Her car was found, empty and near the woods, shortly after her family reported her missing last week . Police are thoroughly searching the woods near where Goode's car was found but they have found nothing as of yet . Goode who works as a medical technician and who is the mother of a four-year-old lives in Suffolk with her mother and her daughter. NBC reports that a woman who lived a mile away  on the street where the car was found noticed that the license plate was bent and that the numbers were obscured. Thinking the car might have been stolen, she reported it to police. Officers are searching the woods where the car was spotted but have found nothing as of yet. 'This is a 21-year-old lady. She has a 4-year-old daughter, a very close family — and the circumstances, as I’ve explained, are suspicious to us,' said Suffolk County police Detective Sgt. Michael Fitzharris. 'Your baby girl can’t wait to give you that great big hug when you come home. We just want you to come home safely,' Goode's sister Elizabeth DeMuria said tearfully. 'Please, if anybody knows anything, please let somebody know,' she added. Neighbors fear for Goode's safety as well as for their own and hope that she is out of harm's way. 'We’re horrified – I mean, we’re praying that she, you know, maybe just didn’t tell her parents where she was going,' one neighbor told CBS. Goode recently broke up with her boyfriend but police don't have any suspects nor have they chosen a person of interest. Goode's friends and family say she has no drug or alcohol problems and they describe her as 'gracious, outgoing, and caring.' She is described as being 5 feet, 3 inches tall, weighing 100 pounds and having long, brown hair with blond highlights, brown eyes and a flower tattoo on her foot. Anyone with information regarding Goode's disappearance is asked to call Suffolk County Crime Stoppers at (800) 220-TIPS. 'Your baby girl can¿t wait to give you that great big hug when you come home.

One 17-year-old from canton, Georgia whose girlfriend cheated on him with his best friend decided to get the best revenge by posting a hilarious text exchange between he and his ex on Twitter. When Kane Zipperman's ex texted him to ask if the relationship was actually over, his response was a carefully thought out series of witty insults and internet memes. Since posting the conversation on his Twitter @KaneZipperman has received over 71, 762 re tweets and 90, 434 favorites. Kane Zipperman, 17, got revenge against his cheating ex by being hilarious in a series of texts that he later posted to his Twitter . Kane posted his entire text exchange between he and his ex on Twitter . 'So Um...I still like you...alot,' said Kane's ex. 'I like meth,' he wrote as a witty comeback. As the text exchange progressed his ex wrote, 'It was just one guy. Cmon Kane...Please...I miss you...No guy has ever treated me as good as you...You are literally the sweetest and cutest guy on the planet. Will you please be mine again...?' Kane charmingly replied with a meme of Mila Kunis saying, 'No. Go f**** yourself.' Later in the conversation when Kane's ex calls him a 'douche' for posting their conversation on Twitter,  he spins her 'It was just one guy' line into 'It was just one tweet.' 'Can you actually say something to me please?.' she begged. Kane pointed out that at one point in their conversation his ex was quoting Hitler . Kane then humorously texted back with the infamous meme of the 'I like turtles' kid being interviewed by a news reporter. 'Why do you hate me?' his ex inquired a few minutes later. 'Despite the fact that you cheated on me with my best friend, I don't hate you. I just strongly dislike you.' His ex then responded, 'Hate is more lasting than dislike.'

O'Donnell who is now in Los Angeles joined Alex Wagner of NBC to discuss his return which she quipped is 'more bearded than ever.' When asked about his experience during his two month leave, O'Donnell said he suffered some difficult times but that overall it was 'a pretty great two months.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A happy and healthy Lawrence O'Donnell makes his return to television two months after suffering a broken hip from a car crash . 'As you know I am not a workaholic,' he joked. 'I am not the first one in the building every morning,' he added. He also called his time away a 'real clearing of the head,' and said that he knows 'no news,' except for information about The Tony Awards. He told Alex that in the past hour before his appearance he had 'retained no news,' to which she responded he was the 'Rip Van Winkle' of the news world to whom all news would be eye-opening. Alex noted how the lighting of the Los Angeles studio made him look better than ever. He then joked that the lighting was 'better than plastic surgery.' His studio is in Universal City at The Universal Studios lot where 'movie making' happens. Even though he's spending time in L.A., O'Donnell said that he would be in New York often. Before saying goodbye, Alex asked O'Donnell what the one thing he's missed the last two months would be. Thinking she asked him what he would miss about being away he responded, 'Painkillers work.' 'That would be the one thing.' Lawrence O'Donnell sported a more clean-cut and serious look before the crash . After a month away in a hospital following a car accident, MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell called into his show The Last Word Wednesday on May 14 to reveal that he suffered a broken hip. When O'Donnell and his brother, Michael, were traveling abroad they got into an accident while riding in a taxi April 15. After flying home to the U.S., Lawrence O'Donnell, 62, has been getting treatment in New York and Michael has been hospitalized in their native Boston. The veteran TV presenter's colleague Alex took over 'The Last Word' on Tuesdays and Ari Melber has been filing in Wednesdays and Thursdays. On Wednesday May 14, Melber got a surprise on the air when his injured co-worker called into the show to offer viewers an update on his condition. The 3-minute exchange with Melber was punctuated with quips and sarcastic jabs, proving that while O'Donnell may have fractured his hip, his sense of humor remained intact. ‘One thing I want everybody to know is that Carl Rove's rumor that I’ve had brain damage… that is completely untrue, so make sure that goes away,’ O’Donnell told Melber, poking fun at the Republican strategist over his recent comments about Hillary Clinton’s health. Scroll down for video . Ready for his return:  O'Donnell has been . hosting 'The Last Word' on MSNBC since 2010 (pictured), and he is expected to resume his duties next month . After a few seconds of friendly banter, O'Donnell promised to provide additional information on his eminent comeback next week after he meets with his surgeon. The 62-year-old political analyst shed light on his physical state, saying that the taxi collision left him with a fractured hip and injuries to his legs that required surgery for the first time in his life. After trading a few friendly jabs with Melber, whom O’Donnell jokingly called out for being more concerned with his vacation time than with his colleague's health, The Last Word host revealed that he is expected to be back on air in June. ‘That would be great because then I could make vacation plans,’ Melber quipped. ‘Of course, this of course is really all about you. Never mind that I was the one who was in the car crash,’ O’Donnell retorted in jest. O’Donnell added that now that he is feeling more energetic, he will continue calling into the show and may even join Skype so that his viewers could see him on screen-which they did today in a professional studio. Funnyman: Ari Melber joked that if O'Donnell returns to MSNBC in June, he would be able to make vacation plans . Get well gifts: O'Donnell shared a photo of these flowers (left) sent to the hospital by the team from Morning Joe, and he joked that Bill O'Reilly's book Killing Jesus (right) is just what he needs to fall asleep . ‘And remember: I have access to the control room, so any time, when you least expect it - like right now - I could end up being your next guest,’ O’Donnell warned. O’Donnell finished the chat by asking viewers to stay with MSNBC ‘for more of The Last Word with the hardest working man in cable news, Ari Melber.’ ‘This is so great to get back in the saddle this way,’ O’Donnell gushed about doing the tease. While the host has been away from the small screen for the past two months, he has remained active on Twitter, answering viewers’ questions about his recovery and commenting on the news of the day. In response to a fan's query on Twitter in May, Mr O'Donnell said that his brother is recovering on schedule, and that he was discharged from the hospital the day before. On May 5, he tweeted that he was learning how to walk with crutches after spending weeks getting around in a wheelchair and then with the help of a walker. Keeping tabs: O'Donnell jokingly warned Melber that since he still has access to the control room, he could end up as his next guest when he least expects it . O’Donnell followed up three days later with a message thanking his 'heroic' nurses and a 'brilliant' physical therapist. O’Donnell also revealed to his 241,000 followers that he is now sporting a full beard since he has not shaved since the accident. Lawrence O'Donnell has hosted the 10pm news analysis show since 2010. He is married and has a daughter. It is unclear where the O'Donnells were when the accident took place, and the left-leaning host did not leave any clues about his trip on his Twitter feed.","O'Donnell, 62, was back on TV today in Los Angeles with a full beard .

"By . Associated Press . and Alexandra Klausner . A Salt Lake City police officer has been placed on leave after refusing an assignment to work at a gay pride parade Sunday. Department spokeswoman Lara Jones says the officer was among about 30 officers assigned to provide traffic control and security for the annual Utah Pride Parade in Salt Lake City. She says the department does not tolerate bias and bigotry, and it does not allow personal beliefs to enter into whether an officer will accept an assignment. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A police officer was put on leave for refusing to work Salt Lake City's gay pride parade (pictured) on Sunday . Executive director of the Utah Pride Center Stephen Ha is pleased that the Salt Lake City police department is taking a stance against bigotry . She declined comment on the officer's reason for refusing the assignment. 'We have gay men and women that serve in the police department,'Jones told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'One officer’s situation does not reflect the vast majority of officers that work in the Salt Lake City Police Department and certainly not Chief Burbank’s.' The officer, whose name wasn't released, is on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation. 'Officers are routinely assigned posts,'Jones said. 'To have an officer object for, perhaps anything other than fitness for duty, physical fitness etc.,  would be problematic to a smooth-functioning police department.' Lara Jones, a spokesperson for the Salt Lake City police department said that police must put their personal beliefs aside for the good of the community . Utah Pride Center officials say they're pleased with the department's stance and think officers should undergo sensitivity training before joining the force. 'Clearly the officer’s act was more than just smelling of bigotry, but I think the act was bigotry, choosing to not do a duty that is sworn by police officers to do,' said the executive director of the Utah Pride Center Steven Ha. Jones told reporters that bigotry is not allowed in the department and even though the unidentified officer is on paid leave he may lose his job. 'We have gay men and women that serve in the police department,' Jones told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'One officer’s situation does not reflect the vast majority of officers that work in the Salt Lake City Police Department and certainly not Chief Burbank’s.' Police Chief Chris Burbank is supportive of the gay community and has even ridden in the pride parade. 'The vast majority of officers understand: When they put their badge on . and come to work, they leave their personal beliefs at home, and we . provide service to the community,' said Lara Jones.

After a long battle with Sriracha manufacturer Hung Fuy Foods, officials from the city of Irwindale have rescinded their declaration that the factory is a public nuisance after a visit to the factory on Tuesday. Once Irwindale residents began complaining that the air around the factory was 'too spicy' and that they were suffering from health issues, CEO David Tran was told to move his $40 million 655,000-square-foot corporate headquarters and it was declared a 'public nuisance.' City Manager John Davidson, Mayor Mark Breceda and Councilman Julian Miranda toured the factory and announced today that the factory was 'extremely clean' and 'beautiful.' Irwindale Mayor Mark Breceda, right, pulls out his personal bottle of Sriracha hot sauce to show his support to find a solution to Sriracha's smell issue during a city council meeting . The Irwindale City Council voted Wednesday  night to drop a public nuisance declaration and lawsuit against Huy Fong Foods after a visit to the factory (pictured) on Tuesday . 'We’re looking forward to being partners for a long, long time,' Breceda told the LA Times. 'We’re almost sorry that this has gone on so long,' he added. The battle was a hot topic among politicians from places like Texas who invited Tran to move his factory there with open arms. Tran repeatedly asked officials to visit the factory. Once he put a statement in writing and offered to fix the problems that the council saw and included an outline for specific measures, Irwindale politicians began to take notice. 'We just needed it in writing,' Breceda said. The factory will grind their peppers again at the end of July and while their air filtration process hasn't changed much, Tran invited a team of people to visit the factory for evaluation once pepper grinding begins. Owner of Huy Fong Foods David Tran (C) addressed the Irwindale City Council about the Sriracha hot sauce factory controversy in April and invited officials to visit the factory . Officials called the factory 'extremely clean' and 'beautiful' after visiting on Tuesday . Tran previously said the legal battle over the factory he calls his 'loved one' reminds him of living in Vietnam, from which he escaped 35 years ago. 'Today, I feel almost the same. Even now, we live in [the] USA, and my feeling, the government, not a big difference,' he said of his long fight with Iwrindale officials a few weeks ago. A Sriracha shortage in January following food safety regulations in the state of California caused a growing demand for the product and competitors decided to swoop in once the company was at an all time low. Other manufacturers like Tabasco have begun testing their own version of the chili sauce and the product is available online at their 'Country Store.' Trader Joe's also has their own version of the popular chili paste. David Tran patented the look of his product characterized by a clear bottle and a green top however, he couldn't trademark the name because it's derived from a city in Thailand. Even as competitors attempt their own version of the hot sauce, the original brand is here to stay.","City Manager John Davidson, Mayor Mark Breceda and Councilman Julian Miranda toured the factory on Tuesday and found it 'extremely clean'

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi continues to languish in a Mexican jail after being arrested for accidentally taking guns across the border . A U.S. Marine jailed in Mexico on drug charges after accidentally crossing the border says that he's being 'chained to a bed naked and beaten' in custody . Andrew met with Greta Van Susteran of Fox News on Thursday and spoke of disturbing details following his March 31 arrest. Tahmooressi said that he accidentally arrived at a border checkpoint with three guns in his truck after making a wrong turn in California - and told police he didn't mean to be in Mexico. 'I said I have all my stuff back here, plus three guns, but I didn’t mean to be in Mexico, it was an accident and there was no place to do a U-turn,' Tahmooressi said. Tahmooressi said that one officer who was able to speak English said that they would find him an escort to go back to the United States, that is until Mexican officials took over. Tahmooressi said that he was handcuffed and taken to Mexican prison. 'He just took control,' Tahmooressi told Fox. 'He didn't seem to care at all about anything that I had to say. It was like a math equation in his head. Three guns, man equals prison.' Tahmooressi was allowed to speak to his mother on the phone and decided after speaking with her he would have to escape because he feared for his life in prison. 'I thought that if I had went back into the cell that night that something, that I would be raped and killed,'he said. 'And I didn't think that telling the officers would help me at all.' Tahmooressi tried to escape and failed which made tings worse, much worse, he said. He was beaten badly until he was left 'gasping for air.' He was also allegedly chain to a bed with his feet at one end and his hands to another. He told reporters that he got this treatment as a punishment and he began to wonder if they would go after his family. 'I was afraid,' he said. 'I was afraid for my family because I thought, you know these guys they  wanted to harm me and that they were talking to the guards, that they were going to try and get information from the guards about the whereabouts of where my family was.' Andrew Tahmooressi is escorted out of a court house in Tijuana May 28 after being arrested for gun charges in March . Tahmooressi said that after the media began covering the case his treatment in jail has improved. He sometimes 'gets depressed' but is hopeful that things will 'work out.' He told Fox that he hope to be released in one month. Tahmooressi's best friend Marine Mark Podlaski spoke with Greta . Van Susteran days before and said that his jailed friend Andrew . Tahmooresi spoke to him on the phone last week from Mexican prison and . told him he was 'chained naked to a bed' along with other 'disturbing . details.' Podlaski told Fox that Mexico is supposed to be an ally on the United States and said it's 'absurd' that they are treating Tahmooressi so poorly. Podlaski said that his captured friend described being beaten by a bat so britally that his jaw was broken. He was also chained naked to a bed. 'This is from his mouth, what I'm telling you right now is what he endured as an American citizen and a U.S. Marine,' Podlaski told Van Susteren. 'He was chained to his bed for so long that when they finally released him at the end of that four weeks he couldn't even walk, he was crippled from such bad muscle dystrophy and joint pain and not being able to fire the muscles in his body,' he added. After his arrest, Tahmooressi's family hired a private investigator to investigate the case further. Santos told Fox that the torture was inflicted before Tahmooressi's  mother went to the media. Tahmooressi's best friend Mark Podlaski told reporters that his friend is being treated 'like a prisoner of war' The 25-year old U.S. marine veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan, was detained and jailed by Mexican authorities late March after he drove across the Tijuana border with three U.S.-registered guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition . The treatment allegedly started after Tahmooressi had his first hearing for the case. He has since fired his attorney Alejandro Osuna who allegedly instructed him to lie and say that he had never been to Tiajuana. Tahmooressi had in fact been to Tiajuana six times after his detention. A spokesman for Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif. who's involved in the case said that an April 6 email exchange between Osuna and Tahmooressi's family states Osuna told Tahmooressi to 'stick to the script, and keep it short and simple' by saying he had never been to Tijuana. 'Andrew kept insisting he wanted to change it, but our concern was that if he mentioned he had been in Tijuana about six times prior to his detention (which seems to be the case), his story would have been less credible,' Osuna wrote in the email, obtained by FoxNews.com. Tahmooressi says he wants to 'set the record straight' after 'being instructed to lie.' Tahmooressi was represented by a court appointed temporary lawyer at a Wednesday hearing. Osuna confirmed with reporters that he'd been fired but said he didn't instruct his client to lie.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . and Associated Press . The trial of a terror suspect accused of planning a series of attacks in the Tampa Bay Area of Florida resumed today with prosecutors showing footage of what they say is the suspect purchasing weapons from an undercover agent and explaining his plans for a bloodbath at the Hard Rock Casino along with other populated Florida hotspots. Sami Osmakac, 25, a naturalized American citizen born in Kosovo, then part of the former Yugoslavia in eastern Europe was arrested in January 2012 after allegedly buying explosive devices and firearms from an undercover FBI agent who was privately filming the interaction from various hidden cameras. One video shown in court today shows footage of what police say is Osmakac and an undercover police officer going over how to use weapons properly, reports Fox. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Terror suspect Sami Osmakac was in trial again today as prosecutors presented footage of him allegedly exchanging weapons with an undercover agent . Video footage showed in court today shows an undercover agent fitting the suspect with ammunition . The undercover agent is then shown handing the suspect a rifle to allegedly carry out his attacks . Fox reports that Osmakac is seen in the video holding guns, learning how to load and reload, and practicing a stance. Jurors in the court room also saw video footage of Osmakac and the undercover loading a car-bomb and moving materials from a pickup truck to the car that would have been used in the alleged attack. The undercover was able to film the exchange from a dark room in the upper floor of the building above the parking lot. Video footage ends with the the undercover agent driving away in the pickup truck and the terror suspect driving away in the car with the fake bomb attached. Prosecutors say that Osmakac was driving the car to MacDinton's Irish Pub where he was hoping to detonate it on a busy night. Video footage and tapes heard in court on Thursday show Osmakac driving with an undercover agent as he allegedly tells him all the spots he planned to attack. The undercover agent then showed the terror suspect how to use the gun properly and make a stance . Video footage and tapes heard in court on Thursday shows Osmakac driving with an undercover agent allegedly telling him all the spots he planned to attack . Fox reports the suspect allegedly planned to use grenades and an AK-47 to take hostages at the Hard Rock Casino as he demanded the release of Muslim prisoners. Fox reports that the jurors were shown the bomb on Thursday and a photo of the bomb was displayed in court as an agent described how it worked to the jurors. The bomb involved in the alleged attack plan was made of two buckets with sleeves on the outside filled with nails and sharp metal objects aimed at killing as many people as possible. The bomb also had a cell phone with a 15 minute timer attached so that the attacker would have time to safely escape the area. The bomb (pictured) given to the terror suspect was a fake that was paid . for and built in the United States and shown to the court on Thursday . Though the bomb looks real it is a fake model built and paid for by the U.S. Government and it does not explode. Osmakac had no idea that he was talking to an undercover agent for the entire interaction and he believed that all the bombs and guns were working weapons. Osmakac's defense say that their client would never have been able to afford the attack had it not been for the U.S. Government's undercover aid. The defense argued that the plot wasn't real until Osamakac had funding and weapons. According to a federal complaint, 25-year-old Sami Osmakac recorded an eight-minute video shortly before his arrest in January 2012 explaining why he wanted to bring terror to his 'victims' hearts' in the Tampa Bay area. In the video, Osmakac is seen cross-legged on the floor with a pistol in his hand and an AK-47 behind him. Osmakac said in the video that Muslim blood was more valuable than that of people who do not believe in Islam, according to the complaint. He said he wanted ""payback"" for wrong that was done to Muslims, according to the complaint. The area's Muslim community helped provide authorities with information, said Steve Ibison, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Tampa division.","Sami Osmakac, 25, was arrested in January 2012 after .

"By . Associated Press . and Alexandra Klausner . Interior Secretary Sally Jewell is touring Jamestown, Virginia and says it's clear that rising seas are taking a toll on America's first permanent European settlement. Jewell trekked and bused her way Thursday through the 1,600-acre island in Virginia's Tidewater region. Guided by National Park Service rangers, Jewell saw sections of the island that now lie beneath the James River and heard of the devastation in 2003, when Hurricane Isabel raked the low-lying landscape.

Sally Jewell, right, listens to park rangers during a tour of Jamestown Island in Jamestown, Virginia where she found evidence of climate change . United States Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, left, looks over recovered artifacts from Jamestown . In an interview with The Associated Press between stops, Jewell called Jamestown a 'hot spot' for climate change. She says climate change is threatening to wash away the nation's history here. Jamestown was founded in 1607. A report released by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in May found that Jamestown is just one of 30 at-risk locations that might be washed away by climate change. 'Sea-level rise, coastal erosion, increased flooding, heavy rains and more frequent large wildfires are damaging archaeological resources, historic buildings and cultural landscapes across the nation,' says the report, National Landmarks at Risk. USA Today reports that according to the USC report, Jamestown will be underwater by the end of the century. Sea levels have risen 1-2 feet across areas of the east and the Gulf Coats. USA Today reports that by 2100 global sea levels will be up anywhere from 1 to 3 feet. Other notable at risk historic sites are The Kennedy Space Center, the site of the Apollo Launch, Cape Canveral, and national parks including Mesa Verde, Bandelier, Cape Hatteras and the Everglades. On the West Coast climate change threatens to increase the risk of wildfires especially in the Southwest, home to many archeological artifacts. Wildfires are often followed by flooding.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . One woman with a rare condition called optic neuritis says that liposuction not only helped her lose weight, stopped her from going blind. Julia Matsumoto was diagnosed with a rare condition called optic neuritis that caused her to go completely blind at the age of 31. A liposuction procedure that involved extracting stem cells from Matsumoto's fat and placing them back in her body helped Matsumoto regain her vision in four days. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Julia Matsumoto thought she'd never be able to see again but a rare stem cell therapy involving liposuction helped her regain her vision in less that three days . Doctors performed liposuction on Julia's stomach and then harvested the stem cells in her fat . According to Medical News Today, 'Adult stem cells can divide or self-renew indefinitely, enabling them to generate a range of cell types from the originating organ or even regenerate the entire original organ.' 'It was the size of a pin drop and eventually, eventually complete darkness,' told CBS of her onset of blindness. When a doctor placed Matsumoto on the steroid presidone, it helped to restore some of her vision but it also made her gain more than 100 pounds in three months. 'It got to the point where I couldn’t walk. I couldn’t enjoy my life,' she said of the weight gain. Doctors searched for alternatives to steroids and what they found was a rare liposuction procedure involving stem cell therapy not yet approved by the FDA. 'As a cosmetic surgeon, I’ve been harvesting fat to throw it out because people want to get rid of it. Now, I tell people who come for liposuction, ‘Don’t be so quick, your fat is loaded with stem cells,’ Dr. Mark Berman told CBS. There is a debate as to whether it was the steroids or the stem cells that helped Matsumoto gain her vision back but doctors are extremely excited about the nearly miraculous recovery.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Tabasco is keeping a hot secret and it's their version of the popular Sriracha hot sauce which they've introduced as a limited edition product only available online at their 'Country Store.' As Sriracha maker Huy Fong Foods fights with officials in Irwindale , California over 'spicy air' emanating  from the factory, competitors are taking an opportunity to create their own version of the chili sauce while the original company fights with their factory's local community. Sriracha owner David Tran claims he's in Irwindale to stay and has no plans of moving his $40 million 655,000-square-foot corporate headquarters but Sriracha has been disappearing from supermarket shelves as the company has had to limit production. Sriracha (left) has a patented appearance but the name Sriracha can be used by Tabasco (right) because the word Sriracha is derived from a place in Thailand . The Huy Fong Foods factory, maker of Sriracha hot chili sauce, has recieved from complaints from residents in Irwindale , California who say the factory makes the air too spicy . Tran says the legal battle over the factory he calls his 'loved one' reminds him of living in Vietnam, from which he escaped 35 years ago. 'Today, I feel almost the same. Even now, we live in [the] USA, and my feeling, the government, not a big difference,' he says. Time reports that companies like Tabasco have decided to create their own product at a time when Huy Fong Foods is at its weakest. Grub Street reports that Tabasco has been hush-hush about their new sauce because the product is still in development and they aren't ready for the big reveal. Currently one can purchase the product online at the Tabasco Country Store for $4.99 for a 15 ounce bottle, about twice the price of the original sauce but they've done almost nothing to publicize the sauce. Owner of Huy Fong Foods David Tran says that Sriracha and his factory are here to stay . When Grub Street asked Sriracha why they are keeping their new product on the down low, they replied, . 'Tabasco Sriracha Sauce is a limited edition product, currently only available through the Tabasco Country Store. As McIlhenny Company develops new products and innovations, occasionally they are shared with fans through the Country Store.' 'Tabasco Sriracha Sauce is made with red peppers and has the slightly sweet and garlicky taste of a traditional Sriracha sauce with the signature Tabasco Sauce balance of vinegar,' they added, . While Tabasco's response doesn't answer the question of why they aren't making the new sauce readily available, rumor is that Tabasco isn't happy with the product or packaging yet. Tabasco isn't the first to copy the chili sauce and it probably wont be the last. Time reports that Trader Joes sells a version of the sauce and Subway has Sriracha flavored products.David Tran patented the look of his product characterized by a clear bottle and a green top however, he couldn't trademark the name because it's derived from a city in Thailand.Tran first built his factory because Sriracha was in such high demand and now that the demand is high but he's had to limit his own productions, it's the perfect time for competators to swoop in and attract buyers.","Tabasco quietly introduced a version of Sriracha which is available online at their 'Country Store'

"By . Alexandra Klausner . As the residents of Woodland Heights in Houston, Texas are sleeping, one man is pooing in his neighbors lawns until the wee hours of the morning. The Houston Police Department believes that the unknown man is leaving his mark sometime between 1:00 and 4:00 am but police still don't have a confirmed motive for the dirty crimes. 'We’ve had reports from six to eight neighbors out there that someone is actually coming into their yard and defecating — generally on their driveways,' said Sgt. J.C. Mosier to CBS. The community of Woodland Heights in Houston, Texas has been terrorized by a mystery 'serial pooper' leaving his mark in their backyards at night . 'I think the neighbors are laughing about it, but that’s because it’s only happened to two houses in the neighborhood. If it starts happening more, I think people might become enraged,' says Amy, a resident from the Heights. How much poop can one man make though?,' she continues. Amy told reporters that one person's yard was pooped in over six times. Sgt. Mosier along with other members of the county believe that the 'serial defacator' may be trying to seek revenge on his neighbors. 'I’m thinking revenge poop is definitely a possibility. We’re all wondering, what did this person who’s having the creep-crapper hit their house repeatedly do?, said Mosier. Mosier says that years ago, a man pooped in other people's yards because he was angry when people let their dogs go to the bathroom on his lawn. A man (not pictured here) has been terrorizing his neighbors by pooping in their lawns at night while they are asleep . 'It turned out to be a neighbor who was mad at people for letting their dogs come in his yard and not cleaning up after them,' said Mosier of the crime from many years ago. He decided to get his own revenge.' Even though some may find the actions amusing, others are taking the serial pooper very seriously and are doing all that they can to catch him. You have to worry about anybody that would go this extreme to do something, no matter what the reason. You don’t know what a person like that is capable of,' said Mosier. No one has been arrested as of yet but surveillance footage shows the suspect to be an aging Hispanic man.","'We’ve had reports from six to eight .

Shay Jones said that her daughter, a student at Ruth Fyfe Elementary School, was told to pee inside of a trash can in her classroom while other students were present and taunting her. Fox reports that the school was on a lock-down because of a report citing a suspicious person in the area. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shay Jones is outraged at the school's lock-down policy which forced her daughter to urinate in front of her peers . Both teachers and students are not permitted to leave their classrooms during a lock-down and the school says that the teacher was merely following instructions put in place by the school district. 'You do not, I repeat, do not put a child on a nasty school trash can with a hard napkin, cover the corner with a partition, put on music so the other students can't hear. You just don't do that,' Jones told Fox. The Clark County School district replied with this response, 'Lock-down procedures in the district are utilized in emergency situations or when there is a perceived threat to safety. During a lock-down, staff and students are told not to leave their work or classrooms for safety reasons. The district will look into this situation to determine if additional staff training is needed to prepare for future situations.' Jones says whether the school is meant to keep kids in the classroom or not she'd like an official apology. Ruth Fyfe Elementary School is set up in such a way that students need to go outside the building in order to go to the bathroom, hence why the send-grader was forced to stay inside during lock-down . 'I contacted the school. I got nothing. Not even an apology,' Jones said. Jones told reporters that her daughter is traumatized after the incident and fears for her child's mental health should other students continue to make fun of her. The school district responded to the event with the following statement, 'Ruth Fyfe Elementary School is an outdoor school and there is no way for this student to access a restroom without exiting the safety of the locked-down building. A lock-down situation can last a few minutes or several hours, depending on the situation. When a lock-down is instituted, it is normal for teachers and staff to be unaware of how long the school or building will remain in lock-down status. In this situation, the teacher accommodated this student to avoid having the student urinate on his or herself, and create a possible health issue.'Since the bathroom was outside of the building, the school saw exiting the classroom as a safety issue.","Shay Jones said that her daughter was told to pee .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A haunted Chicago mini-mansion, once owned by the inventor of barbed wire, has gone on sale for the frighteningly low price of $159,000. The home, built in 1882, which purportedly witnesses the spirits of children haunting its empty rooms has something of a dark history too. In 2004, a 19-year-old man named Steven Jenkins was fatally shot during a party in the home and in 2007, a John Wilkes Booth impersonator named Seth Magosky suddenly dropped dead at the age of 39 only six months after buying the fated property. Scroll down for video . The Hirum Scutt mansion that's supposedly haunted has been taken off the market but was only originally priced at $159,000 . The home which once belonged to Civil . War Veteran and  barbed wire pioneer Hiram Scutt has become legend in . the suburb of Joliet - some have reported hearing voices and have felt . things like 'fingers running through their hair.' The . Illinois Paranormal Research Association (IPRA) claims that the doll . room in the home on the third floor is especially haunted. And . while $159,000 may seem low for a 4,960-square-foot, five bedroom home, . realtor Maria Cronin claims this is because of the renovation work the . home needs. She claimed the low price had nothing to do with the mansion's supposed ghostly inhabitants. At a recent open house, interest was definitely high was 175 people showed up to spend some time in the ghostly mansion. Some . were potential buyers, but most were paranormal experts and ghost . hunters who sought to contact the spirits who may be living in the home. The doll room (pictured) on the third floor of the mansion is especially haunted according to paranormal investigators . Paranormal investigators claim that they heard voices inside of the doll room and even felt as though someone or something was touching them . 'I didn't know what I was getting into when I took this listing,' Cronin said. Spiritual . and psychic reader Edward Shanahan wrote in 2010 on his Chicago . Paranormal and Spiritual blog that the mansion is extremely haunted and . claimed there are compelling videos from multiple paranormal groups as . alleged proof. The home's third floor 'doll room' has allegedly been a particular hotspot of paranormal activity. The Joliet Patch reported that Cronin hopes that whoever buys the mansion will turn in into a bed and breakfast. The . mansion has an extremely rich past. After Scutt died in 1889, his son .

When real estate broker Brian Kearney bought the mansion in 2004, he would rent out rooms in the mansion periodically. In . 2004, Jenkins was shot dead during a party held in one of these rooms . and in 2007, Magosky died after working to turn the mansion into a . Victorian museum. The 'haunted' mansion's real estate agent claimed the mansion's low listing price is based on the amount of work that needs to be done in the space, not because of its history .","The mansion built in 1882 once belonged to Civil War Veteran and barbed wire pioneer Hiram Scutt .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . When a high school senior from Flourton, Philadelphia asked Shaun White to prom she never thought her wish would come true. Not only did the Olympic snowboarder attend her prom, he played a live show at the event with his band Bad Things. Carly Monzo, a student at an all-girls Catholic school called Mount St. Joseph Academy learned that Shaun White had never attended his own prom before and therefore decided to make an epic video to ask him to hers. Using a camera by GoPro, one of White's Sponsors, she filmed herself reading a witty poem and then posted the clip on Vimeo. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Carly Monzo (left) went to prom with her favorite celebrity Shaun White after asking him out in a movie she posted on Vimeo . Carly Monzo wasn't afraid to ask her favorite celebrity Shaun White to prom in an adorable video . The poem read, 'Roses are red, violets are blue, My name is Carly Monzo, but I'm sure you had no clue. I'm currently a senior @ an all girls school. So when it comes to dates there's no boy pool.' 'I have a six-foot rule & I know you're 5'9"" but I can overlook that 'cuz DAMN you're FINE.' After seeing the video, White decided he'd be Monzo's date but he kept his prom appearance a secret with some help from the school who fully supported his attendance. 'I didn't know that Shaun would be there until they dropped the curtain on the stage,' Monzo told The Philadelphia Daily News about her surprise. 'The dean of students called my name and I thought, 'Oh my God, what did I do?' I mean, I've spent time in her office, but it's usually for uniforms things.' Monzo had a wonderful time with her dream-come-true prom sate snowboarder Shaun White . Shaun White tweeted this picture before surprising Carly Monzo at her high school prom . When asked if Shaun was a good prom date, Monzo told reporters that he went beyond her expectations. 'He just pulled out the dance moves,' Monzo said. 'I thought he was going to have trouble keeping up with me but I was like, 'I can't keep up with this.' Monzo even got a kiss on the cheek from her favorite celebrity and danced on stage behind him while he played with his band.Monzo originally had another date lined up for the prom but he didn't mind when she ditched him for White as his band's performance was mind-blowing for the entire school.

"By . Julian Robinson . Doctors have removed what is believed to be the world’s largest tumour from a man’s leg – after it grew to more than 17 stone. Yang Jianbin, 37, from Shanxi Province, China was born with a dark birthmark on the right side of his lower back – and noticed it getting larger when he was nine. By the time he was 12, it had increased to the size of a fist and he had surgery to remove it. Yang Jianbin is pictured in hospital in Beijing, China before having the 'world's largest' tumour removed . Yang Jianbin goes under the knife at the hospital in Beijing. He first noticed his birthmark getting bigger at primary school when he was nine . But despite medical intervention, it started to grow again and a recent hospital check in Beijing revealed that the tumour had increased to an enormous 110kg – more than 17 stone. Chief surgeon Chen Minliang said Yang suffered from Neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that affects the normal growth and development of cell tissue. ‘We have seen neurofibromatosis patients before, but this is the biggest nerve tumour we ever saw,’ he said. The 37-year-old had surgery to remove the tumour when he was 12, but it started to grow rapidly again in recent years . Before it was removed, the tumour was so big, Yang Jianbin, pictured in hospital, was only able to lie down or sit in bed all day . Chief surgeon Chen Minliang said the patient suffered from Neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that affects the normal growth and development of cell tissue . Yang had said previously that the huge tumour was so big he could only lie down or sit on bed all day. He was given two hospital beds to accommodate the 1.2m tumour, which made up two-thirds of his total body weight. Removal surgery involved nine doctors and lasted 16 hours. During the procedure, the patient received 5,000ml of blood, which is more than the entire amount an adult's body holds. But he is said to be recovering well and is expected to be discharged from hospital in Beijing later this month. A toddler in CHina with a tumour the size of a melon is set to receive life-changing surgery . Last month, the world's biggest uterine tumour, weighing 30lbs and measuring 21 inches in diameter, was removed from an Indian woman. Doctors in the southern city of Chennai performed a complex operation on a 52-year-old woman identified as Latha. She had been suffering breathlessness and fatigue for several years but had no idea the giant tumour - similar to the size of a watermelon - was growing inside her. Latha has recovered and has since been discharged from hospital. Just days ago it was revealed that a toddler with a tumour the size of a melon growing from his bottom was set to receive life-changing surgery. The tumour weighed in at almost as much as the young unnamed boy himself and medics in China were set to perform an operation to remove it, thanks to a flood of donations to help the youngster. According to the boy's grandmother, there was no indication during the pregnancy that there was a anything unusual about the baby. But when he was born, it became clear that he had a tumour the size of a grapefruit on his bottom. The family sought help at many hospitals, most of which were unable to help, and all the while the tumour continued to grow, reaching the size of a melon. The family’s plight was picked up by local media and a hospital stepped forward, agreeing to treat the boy, while donations flooded in from the public to pay for the treatment. Experts at Quanzhou Children’s Hospital, who have accepted the child for an operation, say that the tumour can almost certainly be safely removed so that the boy can make a full recovery.

Police reportedly were called to a home in Beverly Hills about 8:30 p.m. Friday about an 'unknown trouble.' When authorities arrived at the home in the 400 block of Doheny Drive they discovered that a woman inside had been shot and was waiting inside with her husband. Beverly Hills: The suspected home invasion happened in an upscale neighborhood in posh Beverly Hills . The female and male victims, described by NBCLA as being 60 and 70 years old, respectively, were taken to a nearby hospital where the husband was being evaluated and the wife was being treated for the gunshot wound. Authorities expect the female victim to survive. Police in the area are now searching for three male suspects in connection with the suspected home invasion and shooting. Residents in the area were told by authorities to stay inside their homes. According to CBSLA.com, police arrived at the scene and immediately established a perimeter. The station reports that both K-9 units and the SWAT team was at the scene searching for the three suspects. The home in the posh neighborhood near the historic Greystone Mansion is just blocks from a home once rented by both Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe - although, not at the same time.","The suspected home invasion happened in the 400 block of Doheny Drive .

That date will see the release of full runs of 'The Sopranos,' 'Six Feet Under',' 'The Wire,' 'Big Love,' 'Deadwood,' 'Eastbound and Down,' 'Family Tree,' 'Enlightened,' and 'Treme.' Early seasons of 'Boardwalk Empire' and 'True Blood' will also be available, as will the miniseries, 'Band of Brothers' and 'John Adams.' Over time seasons of 'Girls,' 'The Newsroom,' and 'Veep' will also become available. The companies also say that HBO's streaming service Go will likely being offered on Amazon's Fire TV by year's end. Allowing access to HBO content without a cable subscription has been the subject of much speculation since the company launched Go for subscribers only. In a February story, Flavorwire noted that the rapid expansion of streaming services like Netflix, which was successfully developing its own original content, had forced HBO into a position where it needed to provide a stand-alone streaming option. This is the first time the channel's programming has been licensed to a subscription streaming service.

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . A Canadian mom-to-be suffering from a rare form of eye cancer opted to have one of her eyes removed rather than run the risk of the disease affecting her unborn child. Chantal Gauthier-Vaillancourt, a popular midwife in Edmonton who has helped deliver hundreds of babies, underwent surgery on Wednesday to remove her right eye after learning that there was a chance the cancer could spread to the placenta. The operation was successful and both Gauthier-Vaillancourt and the baby are recovering well, friends told local media outlets. Tough decision: Chantal Gauthier-Vaillancourt decided to remove her cancerous eye rather than risk the disease spreading to her baby . Midwife: Gauthier-Vaillancourt is a midwife and has helped deliver hundreds of babies . Gauthier-Vaillancourt was first diagnosed with the rare disease in 2009. 'It was a malignant melanoma in my right eye that could spread to the liver and the bones,' she tells Global News. She first tried natural therapy and then underwent radiation. By the end, doctors told her that she was in remission, but that she and her husband should wait to get pregnant, which they did. Five years after finding out she was in remission, Gauthier-Vaillancourt found out she was pregnant. 'We were really excited about that,' she says. 'About two weeks later I . went for my regular checkup and it was then that we discovered that the . tumour had grown substantially in a very short period of time.' Options: The couple's options were limited to abortion or risky surgery, neither of which seemed appropriate for them . Doctors told Gauthier-Vaillancourt that there was about a 25 percent chance that her cancer could spread to her placenta. But the options she and her husband had to consider were not good. “Abortion, radiation, surgery [to remove the tumour]: none of those . seemed appropriate for us,” says Gauthier-Vaillancourt, who knew if the . surgery caused premature birth her child would not survive. A fundraiser website has been setup to cover the costs of some of the natural therapies she has undergone, which aren't covered under her provincial health insurance plan. So far, the fundraiser has raised more than $20,000. Success: Friends say the surgery to remove Gauthier-Vaillancourt's eye was successful and that she and the baby are recovering well . Gauthier-Vaillancourt says she is appreciative of all the support from her friends and family. “It’s been a rough tide, but at the same time, I mean, everyone has . problems and I honestly feel it’s just another bump in the road,” she . says. “I keep saying, ‘This baby chose me, chose this situation and is . very strong.’”","Chantal Gauthier-Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare eye cancer in 2009 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . They may be a hallmark of a galaxy far, far away, but sci-fi deflector shields similar to those in the Star Wars films could one day become a reality, according to a scientific paper. The technology - which in the blockbusting films protects pilots including Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Darth Vader from enemy laser fire - is in fact scientifically possible, a theoretical study says. Indeed the research, published by physicists from the University of Leicester, claims that the raw materials already exist to create the shield, fuelled by powerful magnets, which in the films protects ships like the X-Wing and TIE fighters from powerful laser blasts. Shields: The the Star Wars films, spacecraft like those pictured are protected by deflector shields. A scientific paper has suggested the technology is theoretically possible . Dogfights: The shields are used by spaceships including X-Wings and TIE Fighters (pictured above). Physicists from the Unviersity of Leicester speculated that a shell of superheated plasma could defend from laser fire . However - as the study admits - the results would not be precisely as seen on the silver screen, as the shields would make it impossible to see out of the starfighters, and would also make it difficult to fire any weaponry in return. In a paper for university publication Journal of Special Physics Topics, three fourth-year physics students at Leicester show that a sufficiently powerful magnet - the likes of which are already used in medical technology - could sustain a shield which could block laser fire. The scientists - Alexander Toohie, Joseph Macguire and Alexandra Pohl - also point out that the type of shield they proposed already exists in the upper reaches of the Earth's atmosphere. Their paper proposes that a replica deflector shield could be created by holding a shell of plasma - super-heated particles charged with electricity - in place with a magnetic field. Calculations in the paper show that a sufficiently dense field to block Star Wars lasers - which are intense blasts of visible light - could be produced by a magnetic field of five Tesla - a unit of magnetic strength. Magnets of up to 3 Tesla are used in MRI scanners, and magnets as strong as 60 Tesla are used for research. Flying aces: Characters including Han Solo, left, and Darth Vader, right, both often fly spacecraft in the Star Wars films which benefit from deflector shields - which scientists speculate could be fuelled by magnets which already exist on Earth . A layer of plasma - which acts as a shield - already exists around the Earth, and helps protect the planet from debris and radiation from space. Long-distance radio operators already use the phenomenon to 'bounce' radio signals off of the inside of the so-called 'ionosphere' shield to communicate with devices farther than the horizon. The paper does acknowledge that a very large power source would be needed to sustain the shield, which might make it impractical for a small spaceship like an X-Wing. The temperature of the plasma layer - around 750C - could also present problems. However, they suggested the lack of visibility could be overcome by using an ultra-violet camera, which would allow pilots to see the outside world using frequencies outside of the range of the shield. Alexander Toohie, one of the authors, told science website Phys.org: 'The Earth's atmosphere is made up of several distinct layers, one of which is the ionosphere. 'The ionosphere is a plasma, and extends from roughly 50km above the surface of the Earth to the edge of space. Just like the plasma described in our paper, it reflects certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, in this case radio frequencies.' And even though the technology may not have great military uses, it could be useful for containing dangerous amounts of energy - for example in nuclear reactions. Mr Toohie continued: 'Another possible application of this principle may be for trapping radiation inside a shell of plasma rather than excluding it. This may be useful for applications that require incredibly high temperature environments, such as experimental fusion reactors.' The timely piece of research comes as . filming gets underway for the seventh Star Wars film, the cast for which . was announced this week. On Tuesday Disney and Lucasfilm confirmed on the official Star Wars . website that Girls star Adam Driver would take a part in the relaunched . film as well as newcomers John Boyega and Daisy Ridley.

Also on Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates finally acknowledged that it is standing in for one corner of George Lucas' galaxy far, far away. Abu . Dhabi's government-backed twofour54 media hub confirmed that the next . installment of Star Wars is currently filming in the Middle Eastern . emirate. It was the first official word from the Gulf nation that . filming had begun. Emirati officials previously had refused to confirm or comment on filming, despite Abram’s production company, Bad Robot, tweeting the news last Friday. Using the hashtag ‘#dayone’, a picture of the first film clapperboard was shared for the internet to go wild about. Taking the production to Abu Dhabi marks a move away from the original desert locations used in the first six Star Wars installments. For Episodes I-VI, various spots in Tunisia were used the most to film sandy scenes, including the region of Tatooine, which George Lucas decided to name Luke Skywalker's home planet after. Additional footage was later shot in the Death Valley National Park. Cast: The line-up for the new film was announced on Twitter with a picture of all the actors, old and new, reading through the script with J.J. At the . Tunisian government's request, the set for Anakin Skywalker's (Darth . Vader) hometown in the Tatooine desert, Mos Espa, stil remains in the . Sahara desert. Now . in Abu Dhabi, a ‘whole world’ has reportedly been built in one of its . salt lakes, according to local media outlet The National. A ‘shuttle-like’ craft as well as several jet-powered buggies have also been spotted in the area not to mention a ‘large tower’ and a ‘big, centuries-old-looking market’. Images obtained by Abu Dhabi's The National show a giant marquee with crew members wheeling bits of set and props in and out ahead of the first day of production. It will soon move to a studio far, far away as the majority of the movie will be filmed at Pinewood, where the newly announced cast first got together to read through the script. Props: The National reports that jet-powered buggies have been spotted in the filming location in Abu Dhabi, which could be similar to these speedy vehicles ridden by Leia and Luke in the earlier films . Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher . (Princess Leia), Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Anthony Daniels (C3PO), . Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) and Kenny Baker (R2-D2) have returned to the . franchise, but Abrams has still made room for some fresh faces. British actors John Boyega (Attack The Block) and Daisy Ridley (Mr. Selfridge) join Adam Driver (Girls), Oscar Isaac (Inside Llewyn Davis) and Dohmnall Gleeson (Frank) in the film. Performance capture king Andy Serkis will bring his precious talent to a number of roles and veteran screen actor Max von Sydow (The Exorcist) has also signed on.

"By . Wills Robinson . Attack: Detective Paul Whiteley, 51, told a holidaymaker: 'I'm a copper, I can do what I want' as he attacked him in a pub after drinking for seven hours . A murder squad detective’s career lies in tatters today after he was convicted of a shocking attack on a holidaymaker in a pub while shirtless and completely 'legless'. Detective sergeant Paul Whiteley, 51, of West Yorkshire Police’s Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, is set to lose his job after saying: 'I'm a copper, I'll do what I like' before drunkenly assaulting another customer at Fylingdales Inn in Whitby, North Yorkshire. The 51-year-old told the mother of an autistic child to 'f*** your f***ing disabled child' during the outburst which could end his 22-year career. Witnesses described how Whiteley ripped off his shirt during the argument before shouting: 'Come on outside you bald-head b*****d'. He was staying at a campsite and had been drinking for seven hours with his girlfriend, Claire Hughes, 43. Scarborough Magistrates' Court heard electrician Carl Sarsfield, 41, was asked to have a word with the couple when a barmaid spotted them heading for their car, still carrying open bottles of wine. He said: 'I went out there and asked him politely ""You are not drinking and driving are you?""' He claimed Whiteley, who was getting in the passenger side, replied; 'I’m not driving - she is.' The electrician objected, saying: 'She is legless as well.' Mr Sarsfield said Whiteley and his partner then came back into the pub to wait for a taxi, but things became 'heated'. Whiteley slapped him in the face, prompting Mr Sarsfield to defend himself, leaving the police officer on his back. He said: 'He was absolutely legless. He could hardly stand up. He was falling all over the place. 'I could have burped on him and he would have fallen over.' He then ripped his shirt off after the slap and slung it towards the bar before shouting 'Come on then - outside you bald headed b*****d.' Miss Sarsfield, who was with her autistic daughter at the time, to,d the court: 'He was shouting ""I’m a copper - I will do what I like"". He was paralytic. My initial reaction was to get my daughter away from what was going on. I told them to calm down and there was no need to behave in that way.' The full-time carer said: 'My daughter was hysterical. I saw Carl and the man fighting. The man was very drunk and fell over.' The court heard police were called and Whiteley told the people in the pub: 'Let them come. I’m a police officer. I will sort it out.' Miss Crossley said as they waited for police to arrive Whiteley shouted abuse about her daughter. She added: 'My daughter was absolutely beside herself. It affected her for weeks afterwards.' Reputation: The decorated officer who has served with West Yorkshire Police for 22 years was 'so drunk he could hardly stand up and kept falling over' Partner: Whiteley had been drinking with his girlfriend Claire Hughes, 43, for seven hours. A customer interfered when he spotted the pair walking to their car with open bottles of wine . Mark Kelly, defending Whiteley, told the court how the conviction 'will be simply catastrophic for him, in terms of his reputation built up over many years, employment and any future prospects.' Fining Whiteley £1,455 in court costs, Magistrate Delia Liddle said: 'The level of fine is more serious, having being committed on licensed premises and you were in drink.' The court heard Whiteley was arrested and bundled in a police van after the incident around 9.30pm in May last year. Martin Hawes, prosecuting, described both attacks as 'unprovoked' and denied Whiteley was acting in self-defence. Miss Hughes was charged with assaulting Miss Crossley but she was found not guilty. During the drunken row at the Fylingdales Inn in Whitby, North Yorkshire, he threatened another customer, saying: 'Come on then - outside you bald headed b*****d' Whiteley, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was found guilty of assault by beating after four hours of deliberations. He denied the charge throughout and speaking after the case, his barrister confirmed his client intends to appeal. Whiteley had been suspended for the force for the 14 months that the case has been waiting to come to trial. Detective . Chief Superintendent Clive Wain, of West Yorkshire Police's . Professional Standards Department, said: 'We are aware of the decision . of the court in relation to this officer. West Yorkshire Police expects . the very highest standards of its officers and staff, both on and off . duty. 'The officer remains suspended from duty and an internal misconduct investigation will now commence.'","Det Sgt Paul Whiteley, 51, fined almost £1,500 after 'unprovoked' attack .

"By . Peter Lloyd . Published: . 08:30 EST, 11 September 2013 . After two years of allegations and a gruesome eight-day trial, Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell was finally exonerated from some of the worst crimes imaginable yesterday. The jury at Manchester Crown Court took just five hours to clear the 48-year-old of twelve sex offences against a young girl, including five of rape. The father-of-two had been left ‘fighting for his life’ in both a legal circus and a media scrum. Michael Le Vell: Innocent, but named and shamed. Exactly WHEN will men get pre-conviction anonymity in rape trials?, asks Peter Lloyd . In his willingness to co-operate, he revealed his private self for public scrutiny: a ‘troubled man’ who chain-smoked, drank up to 12 pints a night, had a string of one-night stands and an affair with a younger woman while his wife had cancer treatment. Now, he is free. But, like thousands of men all over the world, Le Vell’s life has already been destroyed by a system which considers men’s innocence a bonus - not a baseline. And it has to end. The case not only proved that pre-conviction identification doesn’t work, but reiterated a very pertinent question: why, in our best-ever age of equality and human rights, are men still being denied their right to anonymity ahead of a guilty verdict? It is - quite frankly - inhumane and has no place in a civilised society. Naturally, the Crown Prosecution Service defended the case being brought to trial, saying: ‘It is for the jury to determine whether a defendant is guilty or not and we of course respect the verdicts they have reached today.’ But the CPS is not middle England. Regardless of yesterday’s ruling, millions of onlookers will favour their own agenda-driven conclusion to that of an informed jury. Haters across the world will decide that he is guilty by default. That he is a rapist simply because he is male. Or working class. Or an alcoholic. Perhaps even all three. They will gather around the water cooler and say: ‘there’s no smoke without fire’ or ‘he looks the type’. This, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why a court of law, not a casual observer who is not armed with all the evidence, should convict a defendant. Haters across the world, including some of the most sexist women in journalism, will decide that he is guilty by default. That he is a rapist simply because he is male . Let’s be clear: Le Vell is not a man I would like to befriend, nor do I condone much of his behaviour. But my heart went out to him yesterday. For all his faults, for all his demons, he is a victim of our politically correct (yet morally incorrect) legal system. A creaking, dilapidated machine which has scant regard for men’s rights and the immortality of a rape allegation. Earlier this year, one of the legal profession’s most prominent women - deputy High Court judge Maura McGowan - agreed. She recommended that men be granted pre-conviction anonymity in rape trials as standard. Tellingly, her opinion is held by the majority of Britain. In 2010, a poll conducted by MailOnline showed that 67 per cent of readers want pre-conviction anonymity for rape defendants, as opposed to 33 per cent who don’t. Originally, the law agreed. In 1976, the Labour government introduced anonymity for both the alleged victim and the accused. It operated this way until 1988, when guidelines were relaxed to help police investigations. At the time, the media was far less powerful, less global, less permanent than it is today. There was no internet, no gossip magazines, no mobile phones and no social networking sites. Police techniques and technology were also less refined, so a lack of anonymity helped them. Now, things are different. Dramatically so. And - once again - the law should change to reflect this. Why? Because a ‘not guilty’ verdict is no longer enough to repair the planet-sized crater of damage caused by weeks of daily headlines across the globe. Perhaps more importantly, it’s also a human right to be innocent until proven guilty. Suspiciously, feminists like Julie Bindel disagree. In fact, she once said being falsely accused wasn’t so bad. 'A fair number of celebrities have been accused of rape in the past and do not seem to have suffered longer term,' she wrote in the Guardian. 'To say that an accusation ruins lives is perhaps a sweeping generalisation.' Perhaps she should speak to Peter Bacon. In 2009, he was cleared by a jury in just 40 minutes after being falsely accused of rape by a woman he met through a one-night stand. Although he was exonerated, the incident was so traumatic that he changed his name and left the country. His life was utterly destroyed. Meanwhile, the accuser kept her anonymity - and, for all we know, went on to accuse others. Where’s the fairness in that? 'For all his faults, for all his . demons, he is a victim of our politically correct (yet morally . incorrect) legal system. A creaking, dilapidated machine which has scant . regard for men’s rights and the immortality of a rape allegation' Less than one year ago, in December 2012, the former boyfriend of Amy Winehouse suffered a similar situation when he was the subject of a malicious, fictitious allegation. Reg Traviss was eventually acquitted - but only after his name had been tarnished and his character assassinated. During the case, London’s Southwark Crown Court heard that his accuser  was ‘so drunk she couldn’t stand up or walk’ - but CCTV footage secured by Traviss’ brother (not the police) proved otherwise. Had it not been for this auspicious turn, he would’ve been serving a ten-year sentence. ‘It was absolute torture being locked in a glass box in court listening to shocking lies being said about you,’ he told The Sun. ‘I was so close to my life being over - and I had done nothing wrong.’ His lawyer, Ian Winter QC, added: ‘What is unbelievable is that if we hadn’t found them coming out of the club on CCTV, which the police had totally failed to identify, there was a real risk of a miscarriage of justice.’ That’s because not every allegation is true. And, sadly, not every case that reaches court deserves to be there. Even UK charity Rape Crisis admit that almost five per cent of rape allegations are fake - 'exactly the same as any other crime'. This means that countless men will be named and shamed in the media. Simply because they are male - not because they are guilty. It goes without saying that I despise rape - I despise any crime of that ilk. But what I equally hate is injustice. And, contrary to yesterday's verdict, that's exactly what has been handed to Michael Le Vell . To say this doesn’t matter is not only insane, but dangerous. It also smacks of a darker gender agenda. Ironically, women like Julie Bindel are enraged at the concept of pre-conviction anonymity, yet so few of them are equally outraged by the false accusers who betray the sisterhood (and the real victims of rape - both male and female) with their lies. Yet these women are damaging rape justice more than pre-conviction anonymity ever could. Yes, I sympathise that not every case is reported. I also sympathise that not every victim gets justice. But none of these facts validate the hell imposed on innocent sons, brothers, fathers and boyfriends every single day. Even Labour peer Lord Corbett, who introduced the 1976 law providing mutual pre-conviction anonymity, argued this until his death in February 2012. He told the Evening Standard in 2002: ‘Rape is a uniquely serious offence and acquittal is not enough to clear a man in the eyes of his family, community or workplace. He is left with this indelible stain on his reputation. The case for matching anonymity for the defendant is as strong now as ever’. He was right in life and he’s right in death. Besides, the benefit of mutual anonymity would cut across both genders, helping victims as well as conserving fair trials. For a start, it would deter anyone from making false claims out of spite, seeing the accuracy of convictions rise - not fall. Secondly, it could make testifying easier for those who’ve come forward. Identifying the accused often inadvertently identifies the victim, which adds immense pressure for them. It’s all wrong. The issue is made even more complex when our government officials muddy the waters of truth. In 2010, an official enquiry report led by Baroness Stern - a prison reform campaigner - ordered Harriet Harman to stop misleading the public about rape statistics. For years she’d been pumping misinformation that only six per cent of rapists are brought to justice, when the reality is very different. It is much higher. But Harman’s creepy spin is symptomatic of another problem, because the way we criminalise men in these situations seems to have become political, rather than judicial. Instead of securing robust, fair trials, people now want a system were woman have all the power - and men are on the back foot - as if this would guarantee justice. It won’t. Our modern-day legal system should not be throwing men to the lions in a bid to prove it opposes rape. It is not a PR exercise for the police or the CPS. It is peoples’ lives. It goes without saying that I despise rape – I despise any crime of that ilk. But what I equally hate is injustice. And, contrary to yesterday’s verdict, that’s exactly what has been handed to Michael Le Vell. Sadly, there are thousands of other men who, unbeknown to them, are next in line.

"By . Louise Boyle . Kato Kaelin, the bit-part actor who became famous overnight as OJ Simpson's house-guest at the time of his ex-wife's murder, has revealed that OJ tried to persuade him to provide an alibi for that fatal night 20 years ago. On the 20th anniversary of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, Kaelin spoke to Today along with the father and sister of Mr Goldman. The pair were found brutally stabbed to death at Ms Brown Simpson's LA home on June 12, 1994. Kaelin was staying in a guest house at OJ Simpson's compound . and was present at the time the murders took place. He appeared as a prosecution witness at OJ's murder trial before a rapt but unforgiving public where he was criticized for his rambling, arrogant testimony and dubbed a 'beach bum' and 'parasitic freeloader'. Kaelin said on Wednesday that his life was changed forever by the murders of which Simpson was sensationally acquitted after a grueling eight-month, televised trial in 1995. Scroll down for video . 'Kato the character': The struggling actor was living in a house on Simpson's property at the time of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman's murders in June 1994 and was later called to testify (left).  He said today (pictured right) that the events turned his life upside down and made him an infamous public figure whom people still have opinions on . 'One day I walk into a courtroom. I . walk out of a courtroom and everybody’s shouting my name. I became this . public figure and everybody had an opinion,' Kaelin said. 'I . was Kato the character. Still to this day I can’t believe some of the . hate that can come over social media. If I work, they say you’re . capitalizing, still to this day, If I don’t, then I’m a bum.' When asked by Today host Matt Lauer if there were things he could have done differently, Kaelin said: 'I testified to things that I knew, not what I thought happened. And that's the God's honest truth. 'A lot of times, people would say: ""He . looked like a deer in the headlights."" It's because I sat in with the . prosecution for over 20 hours and if a question came in during the . trial, I was going ""I don't remember that question."" 'Being on camera, it's always on you. People were going ""look at that guy, he's lying, he's like a deer in the headlights.""' Kaelin, whose real name is Brian Jerard, also revealed to Dateline, in an episode to be aired tonight, that OJ had tried to persuade him to provide an alibi. He said: 'He . [Simpson] had tried to talk to me one time and tell me, ''You know . where I was Kato, you know I was in the kitchen at this time''. 'He was in . the kitchen trying to convince me about what I believe now was an alibi . for him.' On the 20th anniversary of the murders of Ron Goldman and OJ Simpson's ex-wife Nicole, Goldman's father Fred (center) and sister Kim (left) spoke to the Today show on Wednesday along with Kato Kaelin . Fred Goldman appeared alongside Kaelin on the morning show on Wednesday and said that 20 years after his son Ron's death, the pain of losing him has never faded. Mr . Goldman, 73, said: 'The loss is exactly the same. It's just become a new normal, . minus my son. Without any of the opportunity to share his life with him, his joys, his happinesses, his successes… all of that is gone.' Ron Goldman's sister Kim Goldman said today: 'After my brother died, I didn’t know what that was because everything shifted and I was lost for a really long time.' Ms Goldman said that in the 20 years that have passed since she lost her brother, she has learned 'that I'm resilient, that I'm a fighter, I'm loyal and committed and I know what family is about'. Mr Goldman added: 'If nothing else, I have learned how to adjust. How to change but not change.' Lives cut short: Ron Goldman was 25 and Nicole Brown Simpson was 35 when they were viciously stabbed to death in front of her condominium on North Bundy Drive. Ron was stabbed almost 60 times . The bloody glove: 'If it doesn't fit you must acquit,' said defense attorney Johnnie Cochran about the bloody glove found at the guest bungalow in back of OJ's Rockingham home. Simpson is pictured at his murder trial in 1995 . Bloodbath: The pathway leading to Nicole's door was a horror show of bloody footprints on June 12, 1994. Nicole's body lay at the end of the walkway just below the steps to her door . Fred Goldman revealed to MailOnline this week that OJ's 'Dream Team' lawyer, Robert Kardashian carried away evidence in a suitcase from . the former footballer's home the night his ex-wife Nicole Brown-Simpson . and her friend Ron Goldman were viciously stabbed to death – and took . the secret of where it is to his grave. ‘That evidence would have convicted ""the . killer"",’ he said, who to this day refuses to . refer to the disgraced football player by name. Kardashian, the father of reality TV stars Kim, . Khloe and Kourtney, died of esophageal cancer in 2003. Witnesses whose claims appear to support Mr Goldman's opinion of Simpson's guilt have come forward this week - sharing for the first time information that the murder trial jury never heard. One of those is Rob Kardashian's former wife, Kris Jenner, who was one of Nicole Brown Simpson's closest friends. The reality TV matriarch told Dateline that Nicole had confided in her that she feared for her life in the weeks before her murder. Kris Jenner, a close friend of Nicole Brown Simpson, told Dateline this week that Nicole told her she feared that OJ would kill her and would get away with it . Kris Jenner: 'She told me: ''Things are really bad between OJ and I and he's going to kill me and he's going to get away with it. You'll watch and see what happens.'' She knew exactly what was going to happen to her.' The jury also never heard from Skip Junis who claimed that he saw OJ throwing things away at LAX Airport on the night of the murders. Mr Junis told Dateline: 'A limousine pulled up and OJ Simpson got out of the limousine. He was carrying this little cheap gym bag. 'He zipped it just a little bit at the bottom and was reaching his hand in and pulling things out and putting them in a trash can.' The jury in the OJ Simpson trial never heard from Skip Junis (pictured left) who said he saw OJ throw items into the trash at an airport on the night of the murders. Jill Shively (right) said she saw Simpson drive past her close to the crime scene minutes after the murders were believed to have taken place. She did not testify because she sold her story to the media . Defense attorney Carl Douglas told Dateline that he redecorated OJ's house to give the jury a better impression of it before viewing. He said: 'This is not tampering with evidence...They play hard in the big leagues' Another witness Jill Shively told police she saw Simpson driving his white Bronco SUV near the crime scene minutes after the murders are believed to have taken place. She never testified in court because she sold her story to the press. She told Dateline this week: 'All of a sudden, this white car comes flying north on Bundy with its lights out. I barely missed him. It was OJ Simpson.' Simpson defense attorney Carl Douglas also revealed that he redecorated at OJ's house before the jury came to view the murder scene. He also spoke to Dateline, saying: 'We wanted to make the location look lived in and stand with all of its regalness, so that the jurors would say, OJ Simpson would not have risked all of this for this woman. 'This is not tampering with evidence... I'm trying to get the optimum advantage to win. They play hard ball in the big leagues. This was the big leagues.' According to the Los Angeles Coroner's report, dated June 14, 1994, Ronald Goldman, who was 25 at the time of his death, was stabbed almost sixty times: in his neck, which severed his jugular vein - a fatal wound - the right side of his chest - a fatal wound - and his abdomen - also a fatal wound - but there were many more wounds, some defensive to his hands, but also to his thigh and scalp. The coroner describes many of the wounds as 'taunting' wounds, indicating that Ron may have been strategically stabbed to torture him before he died. Nicole Brown-Simpson's neck was cut from ear-to-ear with her head almost severed from her body and she had been stabbed numerous times in other areas. She was 35, the mother of Sydney and Justin Simpson. A few years after Simpson was found not guilty of the double murder, Fred Goldman and his family filed a wrongful death lawsuit and on February 5, 1997 the civil jury unanimously found the former NFL Hall-Of-Famer guilty of battery against Ron and Nicole. Fred Goldman was awarded $33.5 million in damages but he and his family have seen only a fraction of the money. When Simpson was convicted in Las Vegas, Nevada court on October 3, 2008 of conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery and assault with a deadly weapon - 13 years to the day after he was acquitted of the double murder of Nicole Brown-Simpson and Ron Goldman – Fred and Kim sent OJ a card at the Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada. ‘We hope you enjoy your new home!' it read. Simpson . is currently serving his 33-year sentence with the possibility of parole after . nine years. He went back to court in 2013 hoping to get his conviction overturned due to poor . legal representation but his request was denied by the court stating there was no merit for his accusations. His earliest possible release date from the Nevada prison . will be in 2017.","Kato Kaelin was staying at OJ Simpson's property on June 12, 1994, the night Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were murdered .

"By . Louise Cheer . Zachary Gomo was attacked on Thursday about 10pm on a Melbourne street by two Arabic-speaking men . A former Israeli soldier now living in Australia has told of the shocking moment he was attacked on the street and was left with a slash through his T-shirt, a swollen face and covered in scratches. Zachary Gomo, 28, was walking along Parnell Street, off Kooyong Road, in Elsternwick - in Melbourne's south - when he was ambushed by two men while he was wearing an Israeli Defence Forces shirt from his two-year stint in the service in what he is calling an 'anti-Semitic' attack. At the time, the dual citizen was walking to his girlfriend's place when he noticed two men following him. 'The side street was very dark and apparently empty of people,' Mr Gomo said. 'When I got about halfway down the street, I suddenly noticed that there were two people right behind me. 'I got a shock as I had not noticed them until then which I found odd. 'At that moment they both jumped on me and started punching and shouting in Arabic ""Jew Dog"", ""Allah HuAkbar"" [God is great] and something I didn’t understand about Gaza. 'It completely came out of nowhere. I wasn’t prepared.' Luckily, Mr Gomo was able to fight off his attackers, return to his girlfriend's house and report the incident to Caulfield police station. 'Initially I just attempted to shield myself from their blows, and then one of them grabbed me from my left side as if he was trying to drag me somewhere,' he said. 'At that point, I realised it was very serious and started fighting back. 'I threw punches at both of them and managed to grab one of them by the throat which I proceeded to squeeze as hard as I could. He was attacked on Parnell Road in Elsternwick - in Melbourne's south . Mr Gomo did not notice a weapon at the time, but police say this slash was most likely caused by a screwdriver . 'I pointed at the other man with my free hand and yelled Arabic curses at them as aggressively as possible. 'This startled them quite a bit and when I pushed the one whose neck I was holding away, they fled towards Kooyong Road.' When he got to his girlfriend's house, she noticed Mr Gomo was covered in scratches, his T-shirt sliced open around the belly and his face was swollen. 'I did not notice a weapon at the time but the police later suggested that they might have had a screwdriver or something similar,' he said. Mr Gomo was attacked while walking to his girlfriend's house . Mr Gomo thinks an Israeli Defence Force T-shirt (left) he was wearing sparked the attack which left him with scratches (right) Mr Gomo described his attackers as between the ages of 18 to 20, slim and of Middle Eastern appearance. He believes the T-shirt he was wearing at the time of the attack sparked the ambush. 'It has a scorpion on it and in English it says ""stinger"", which is the airforce special forces I was part of, and in Hebrew it says the word March as in the month and ’08 - the year that my training took place,' Mr Gomo said. 'There are some comments on the Internet saying that I provoked the attack by wearing the shirt, but I don’t think anyone deserves to be attacked like that they no matter what their wearing. 'There’s no way anyone would have identified the shirt unless they knew Hebrew. 'Clearly it was an anti-Semitic attack. 'I just think everybody has the right to be safe on the street and if you have a political protest or something do it civilly and within the law.' Caulfield police station Sergeant Peter Burton confirmed the incident had happened. 'There is an active investigation going on at the moment,' he said.","The incident happened on Parnell St in Elsternwick in Melbourne's south .

"By . Louise Boyle . A horrifying 911 tape of a teenage boy calmly confessing to beating his father to death with a cane and burying his body in the back yard was released on Tuesday. Rylan Salzman, a 16-year-old from Tacoma, Washington, allegedly killed his father on June 6 but waited until the following Tuesday to call police so that he could spend a few last days with his mom and sister. The seven-minute call, published on KIRO-TV, begins with the teenager telling the 911 dispatcher: 'I'm calling to confess to a killing.' He goes on to say that he killed his father, Richard Salzman, adding: 'He's outside in a container of sorts.' Scroll down for audiotape of 911 call .

He was so severely beaten he could only be identified by dental records . The teenager told police that he killed his father at 9pm on Friday after the two of them had been drinking and got into an altercation while he had a cane in his hand. He told the police dispatcher: 'We'd both been . drinking some and there was a confrontation. 'I said something to him and . told him to stop, he shoved me and I had a cane in my hand at the time. 'It wasn't premeditated or anything but I just started swinging. We had a . conflicted childhood, past. It was sort of a tipping point.' The 16-year-old pleaded not guilty to one count of second-degree murder after being charged as an adult last Friday. Richard Salzman, 49, was reported missing on June 5 by his wife Louise Salzman after he disappeared the previous day. 'This is a strange case of patricide,' prosecutor Mark Lindquist told KOMO News last week. 'The motives are still being investigated.' Before . admitting on the 911 call that he had killed his father, the 16-year-old told his . mother that his father had gone on a bike ride that evening, and had . not returned. Louise . Salzman, who had been staying at a family member's home on the night of the murder, filed a . missing person's report the next day. Rylan's sister was home at the time of the killing but he told the police dispatcher that 'she was in her room quite a way away and unaware of what was going on'.

RS: 'No' The dispatcher then asks for Salzman's middle name and his date of birth. 911: 'You mother and sister aware but they've gone to another address?' RS: 'I . told them half an hour ago, that I was calling in, that it would be . better if they were out of the way when they come and take care of . things.' 911: 'They live there with you?'

RS: 'No.' 911: 'Was anyone else there with you when this happened?' RS: 'My sister was at home at the time, she was in her room quite a way away and unaware of what was going on.' 911: 'Did your mom or sister wonder about your father's absence before today?' RS: . 'Oh . yes... truth is, I had every intention of confessing sooner or later . but I wanted a few . more days with them before that happened... but in the meantime, they . had been looking . around and had arrived at a point where they were going hire search and . rescue operator... At that point, well it would be quite pricey so that . would be the time... She did file a missing persons report.' 911: 'Just stay on the line, we'll have someone with you as soon as possible.' RS: 'Ok, thank you.' After filing a missing person's report on her husband with police, Mrs Salzman had decided to gather a . search party, which according to her son 'would be quite pricey' so he decided to confess.

"By . Louise Boyle . An aspiring actor who was arrested after posing as a Twilight star and seducing a 14-year-old girl over Facebook has now been accused of inappropriately touching a second teenage girl. David LaVera, 33, of San Diego, . California, allegedly pretended to be Kiowa Gordon, 24, who played minor character Embry in three Twilight films, to lure girls to a park. The news of LaVera targeting another teenage girl raised questions as to why he was not arrested when the first girl went to the police in Newton, Iowa last week. Scroll down for video . Teenager Raven Adams pictured with aspiring actor David LaVera who claimed to be Twilight star Kiowa Gordon. The girl and her mother allege that Raven was inappropriately touched by LaVera, who has since been arrested . LaVera was arrested on Tuesday after he allegedly inappropriately touched a different girl and drove off with her. The girl was returned to her family unharmed. He had chatted with the girl over Facebook before driving 26 hours from California to Iowa to meet her. Mother Tammy Adams said that prior to this incident, LaVera also tried the same moves on her teenage daughter Raven on June 3. Ms Adams told USA Today that LaVera told her daughter he was the Twilight star and convinced her and a friend to go to a park with him, where he touched her inappropriately. The 33-year-old allegedly asked the teenager if they could meet up at night to make out. The girl planned to stay at a friend's and sneak out to meet him but her mother found out and called the police in Newton. Raven Adams, who attends Berg Middle School, told USA Today: 'They didn't do anything about it. If they had, I don't think this would have happened to this other girl.' After Tammy Adams contacted the police, an officer found LaVera at a bar and gave him a verbal warning but did not arrest him. He was allegedly signing autographs and taking pictures with his 'fans' at the time. Newton Lt. Bill Henninger told MailOnline today that he could not comment on Ms Adams' claims. He described LaVera as 'a wolf dressed in sheep's clothing who children would gravitate to'. Lt. Henninger said that he believed LaVera had been staying in town with a family for around a month. Concerned citizens had called the police department to report seeing LaVera in town with other children, both male and female. He said that he believed that LaVera had been introducing himself both by his real name but had convinced others, in particular groups of teenagers, that he was Kiowa Gordon and signing autographs in his name. David LaVera, 33, (left) was allegedly posing as hunky actor Kiowa Gordon, 24, who played a small role in three of the Twilight Saga films (right) Raven Adams met the actor at her school on May 28 where he was brought by a parents of a student. He was introduced to students as David LaVera, a stuntman from California, before he signed autographs and performed stunts at assembly. On May 29, Raven Adams posted a pictured with the actor on her Facebook page. In the comments below, when asked who he was, she wrote: 'A guy that plays in twilight... he played embry call.' One commenter wrote: 'And have you looked at a picture of embry from the movie... just looks diff.' The teen replied: 'He is older it was like 5 and six years ago and he is a stunt double he filled in for the kne who broke his legs he was young tho.' She added: 'He came to the school he is a family friend of a students his parents met him somewhere and they became really good friends.' The school is now reviewing its visitor policy. It is unclear, after being introduced as LaVera, how the man managed to convince the teenage girls that he was Kiowa Gordon. LaVera was arrested on Tuesday after he convinced a 14-year-old girl to get into his car.  The victim's sister called their mother to tell them the teen had left with LaVera. The mother, April Roush, called police. LaVera and the teen were spotted on the outskirts of town by one of Ms Roush's friends, who stood in front of his car and demanded the girl come with her. After she was safely out of LaVera's vehicle, he sped away. Sheriff's deputies caught up with him a short time later. In his car, they found two swords and four daggers. LaVera has been charged with enticing a minor, carrying weapons and failure to have a valid driver's license. He is being held in Jasper County Jail in Newton on a $50,000 bond and is due to appear in court on Monday. Baxter Police Chief Steve Wright told WHO-TV that he fears to think what LaVera's intentions were for the girl. 'This isn’t somebody that just wants to be friends. And typically this is the kind of person that meets a profile of somebody that can be a predator and can be dangerous,' he said. Ms Roush credited her friend who rescued her daughter with saving the girl's life. 'I don't think I would have ever seen my daughter again. And if so, it would have been to bury her,' she told WHO. Ms Roush says she her daughter was so convinced that LaVera was the Twilight star that she still believes Kiowa Gordon was the one who came to pick her up. According to the Internet Movie Database, LaVera has appeared in 13 movies, including  Die Fighting, Fortune 500 Man and a non-speaking role in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.","A second teenager Raven Adams has come forward to accuse aspiring actor David LaVera of inappropriately touching her .

"By . Nick Pisa . Updated: . 02:48 EST, 28 February 2012 . A cruise ship with more than 30 Britons on board was last night drifting in the Indian Ocean in an area targeted by pirates. The Costa Allegra, which belongs to the company that owns the doomed Costa Concordia, ran into trouble after an engine-room fire knocked out its power. The blaze on the 43-year-old Allegra was put out by sprinklers and the ship’s firefighting team before it had spread. This morning, pictures showed passengers on the upper deck of the Costa Allegra . Tug boats are due to arrive later this morning as authorities decide whether to abandon ship . From an Indian Navy aircraft the waters appear calm around the cruise liner which will help with the rescue operation . But last night it was not clear . whether the 1,049 passengers and crew on board would have to be . evacuated or whether engineers would be able to resolve the problem and . get the 28,000 ton ship started again. Two tugs, two trawlers and another . ship were on their way to the scene but the first of these was not . expected to reach the  Allegra until early today. Among the Britons on board is Hannah . Hargreaves. Last night her mother Christine said: ‘Half of me is . thinking, from what the news is saying, don’t be worried. But obviously . as a parent and a mother you are still always wondering “are they ok?” ‘ . Officials at the Costa Cruises head . office in the Italian port of Genoa said the Allegra was around 260 . miles south-west of the Seychelles. Numerous ships sailing through the . area have been targeted by pirates, mainly from Somalia. There were 151 attacks by pirates on ships in the Indian Ocean last year. In 2009, Britons Paul and Rachel . Chandler were kidnapped by pirates as they sailed their yacht from near . the Seychelles to Tanzania in east Africa. The couple were held captive . for more than a year before finally being released. Six weeks ago the 114,500 ton Costa . Concordia hit rocks just off the Italian island of Giglio after its . captain had changed course to carry out a ‘sail by salute’ to the . island. The ship capsized and more than 30 people, including a . five-year-old girl, died. The skipper, Francesco Schettino, is . under house arrest while charges of multiple manslaughter, abandoning . ship while passengers were still on board, causing a shipwreck and . failing to communicate with maritime officials are investigated.

Blaze: Fire broke out onboard the Costa Allegra (pictured) when it was in the pirate-infested Indian Ocean . A tracking page on Costa Cruise's website shows where the Allegra is adrift off the Seychelles . Last night sources at Costa Cruises said the fire on the Allegra had started due to an ‘electrical fault’. Coward: Costa Concordia Captain Francesco Schettino is under house arrest as investigations continue . The firm said in a statement that the . captain had issued a distress call but ‘no passengers or crew were . injured’ and there had been no evacuation of the Allegra, which was . about 20 miles from Alphonse Island when the fire broke out. Costa spokesman Giorgio Moretti said . the ship was adrift. ‘It is being pushed by the current,’ he said. ‘It . is stable and upright.’ Mr Moretti said he expected the 636 . passengers on board would spend the night on outside decks. Among them . were 212 Italians, 31 Britons and eight Americans. Nine Italian marines were also reported to be on board the Allegra to guard against pirates. The ship had left northern . Madagascar, off Africa, on Saturday and was cruising toward the port of . Victoria, the Seychelles’ capital. After that it was due to sail north, making stops in Oman, Jordan and Egypt before ending its cruise in Savona, Italy. Although Costa said in a statement . that the Allegra was built in 1992, it emerged last night that the ship . was originally a container vessel called the Annie Johnson and had in . fact been been launched 23 years earlier. It was originally used by a Finnish . merchant line for cargo and then in 1986 was bought by Regency Cruises, . which refitted it as a cruise ship. Costa bought it in 1990 and refitted . it again over the next two years.

"By . Louise Cheer . Shocking footage has emerged of AFL fans dragging, spitting on and verbally abusing street preachers after a football game at Adelaide Oval. The video was taken on June 29 right outside the stadium following a Round 15 clash where the Adelaide Crows triumphed over Port Adelaide Power. In the YouTube footage, uploaded by a group who call themselves evAngeliis, the unprovoked attack involves fans of both teams verbally abusing then physically attacking a trio of men spreading the word of God. Scroll down for video . Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide Power supporters are seen abusing street preachers outside Adelaide Oval . The footage shows fans dragging, spitting on and verbally abusing the trio . It is one of four videos on the channel where they are seen taking their gospel to the streets of the South Australian capital. Just before the 23-minute mark, a man wearing a Port Adelaide scarf walks up to the trio - who are identified only as David, Daniel and Brad - and gives them the finger while yelling: 'F*** you, you c**ts. You f**king losers.' Someone then throws a beer at them while the man walks away but not before he spits one of the preachers filming the incident. Minutes later another man - this time wearing an Adelaide Crows jersey - approaches them and asks them: 'Why do you have to throw your [beliefs] in people's faces? Let them believe what they want.' One of the men who approached the preachers yelled expletives at them and gave them the finger before spitting on them . Footage was uploaded on YouTube by street preachers group, evAngeliis . Fans were pouring out of Adelaide Oval after a Round 15 clash between the Crows and Port Adelaide . The man gets increasingly aggressive and then starts pushing them, saying: 'F**k you' to each of the preachers. One of the man's friends goes to shake the hand of the preacher holding the camera, but then attempts to knock the sign out of his grasp. As the video continues, things start to escalate as more of the attacker's friends join in. At one point, one man says: 'God sucks, God is the worse' - attempting to grab the sign again. The alleged instigator starts pushing them around and tells them to 'get out'. One of his friends then drags two of the preachers down a slope while trying to wrestle a placard away from them. Before it goes any further, a police siren sounds and officers intervene, while the attackers scatter. Both sporting clubs have said they had not received any complaints about the incident. Port Adelaide chief executive officer Keith Thomas condemned the actions of punters, saying the behaviour captured in the video was unacceptable. The man on the left goes to shake the hand of one of the preachers but then tries to grab the placard out of his grasp . The incident happened on June 29 in the South Australian capital . 'We take a very dim view of his actions,' he said. 'As a club, we have recently implemented a strict spectator code of conduct that encourages all our supporters to behave in an appropriate manner and refrain from hostile, intimidating and abusive behaviour of any kind. 'And this code of conduct applies to our supporters wearing our club colours both inside the stadium or on the way home.' A spokesman for the Crows echoed Mr Thomas' response. 'We believe everyone has the right to come and go, and attend our matches, without abuse or harassment,' he said. 'Football should be fun and enjoyable for all patrons.' The spokesman said the Adelaide football club also had a strict code of conduct for fans that needed to be followed. 'Breaches of this code can result in someone’s membership being cancelled,' he said. A South Australia police spokesman said officers at the scene did not press any charges at the time as the preachers did not report the assault. It was just a snapshot of some the abuse they were subjected to . South Australia police eventually broke up the scuffle after two minutes .","The video was taken after an AFL clash between two South Australia teams .

"By . Kim Carillo . From the dress to the flowers to the cake, it’s the second-most important event of a woman’s life. You’ve had your Big Day, now it’s your daughter’s time to shine. But being the mother-of-the-bride is fraught with danger. While you want to look your best, you don’t want to overshadow your darling girl. I may be 54, but I take care of my appearance and I feel — and look — better than I did in my 20s. But my daughter Catherine, 26, is getting married soon, to her lovely fiance Kristopher, 27, in a historic church in Kent, and I certainly don’t want to steal the spotlight. So how to choose the perfect outfit? I asked bridal experts to compile five of the best mother-of-the-bride outfits the High Street has to offer. Did I find ‘The One’? Read on to find out . . . Pink lace dress, £295, and shoes, £160,  lkbennett.com Hat, £30, coast.com . THE EXPERT VIEW . ‘The length of hem can make or break your outfit,’ says wedding wear designer Catharina Eden. ‘Too long and it looks dowdy; too short and it looks as if you think you’re 21. ‘The mother-of-the-bride needs to be able to bend down to smooth your daughter’s train, reach up to fix her veil, and sit down and stand up in church without your hem rising. Go for one inch above the knee if you have great legs; one inch below if you don’t.’ KIM'S VERDICT . I love the way this look is modest, but not mumsy. The pretty lace overlay means I can show a little bit of decolletage without having any cleavage on display. The nude colour is slimming, and it fits well, skimming over my hips. I’m not so keen on the hat, which looks like a piece of fishing kit. I thought black was out of the question for weddings, but used sparingly in details such as the lace, shoes and hat, it sharpens up the outfit. SCORE: 4/5 . Floral dress, £129, jigsaw-online.com, . Pink jacket, £129, jacques-vert.co.uk, . Pink hat, from £220, fenwick.co.uk . Shoes, £170, lkbennett.com . THE EXPERT VIEW . ‘Every . mother-of-the-bride wants to cover her arms,’ says Catharina. ‘You don’t . need to have full sleeves — you can go for a lace overlay or wear a . cropped jacket or bolero you can take off later for dancing.’ KIM'S VERDICT . This . outfit ticks all the boxes for me. Flowery dresses can look chintzy, but . this watercolour floral print is on trend and you could pick out any . shade, from pink or purple to teal or blue, for your jacket and hat. It’s fitted but not restrictive, a great length and the neckline doesn’t . show too much cleavage. The bracelet sleeves are comfortable. I’m a big . fan of this hat — it’s like a fascinator, making a statement without . swamping your head. SCORE: 5/5 . Goat dress, £450, fenwick.co.uk . Hat, £280, ginafoster.co.uk . Shoes, £39.99, zara.com . Clutch, £165 russellandbromley.com . THE EXPERT VIEW . ‘A plain outfit can be worn with an . elaborate hat, while an embellished dress works with simple headwear,’ says milliner Sara Gadd. ‘Full hats and larger headpieces are . popular this season, but choose a style that won’t cast a shadow over . your face in photographs.’ KIM'S VERDICT . THIS saucer-shaped creation is a . showstopper but it isn’t too big and it’s incredibly light, so there’s . no danger of ‘hat hair’. The pastel crepe dress won’t crease when you . sit down and the darts are slimming. SCORE: 5/5 . Hobbs dress, £149, johnlewis.com . MaxMara coat, £439, and Whiteley hat, £99, Fenwick fenwick.co.uk . Shoes, £88, boden.co.uk . THE EXPERT VIEW . ‘The bride’s mother chooses the colour . of her outfit first, getting her cue from her daughter,’ says Catharina. ‘The mother of the groom should then go for a complementary hue from a . different colour group. So, if the bride’s mother chooses lilac, the . groom’s mother should go for metallics. As to how pale you can go, if . your daughter’s happy for you to wear cream, try it with gold, which . reflects light on to the face.’ KIM'S VERDICT . Truly lovely. The long jacket will look . smart, but I can take it off for dancing. It’s a flattering length, and . not too restrictive, while the metallic spots give it the wow factor. I . love the gold shoes, which take the outfit up a notch. The hat is light . and unobtrusive, and the weave matches that of the dress and . coat. SCORE: 4/5 . Blue coat, £99, marksandspencer.com .

"By . Kim Carillo . From crow’s feet to drooping lids and crepey skin, ageing really affects our eyes. Add thinning lashes, a common symptom of the menopause and suddenly what was your best feature is adding years to your face. At 53, my eyelashes have not only thinned, but they appear shorter, leaving my eyes with no real definition. Celeb fan: Lauren Goodger is one of many female celebrities who have endorsed a range of false eyelashes . Add to that the dull complexion that so often strikes women of a certain age, and I feel thoroughly gloomy about my looks. My eyelashes are patchy and sparse in places. And as a blonde, without mascara you can barely tell they are there at all. So, could the false eyelashes that are such a staple in the older woman’s make-up kit — celebrities such as Helen Mirren and Nigella Lawson are rarely spotted without them — also help me? Previously, false lashes have always looked, well, false, but in the past few years, the technology has evolved. They’re now lighter, easier to apply, and it’s possible to choose an exact shape, style, colour and length of lash to suit your face. I put three of the leading lashes on offer to the test . . . £6.50, eylure.com. Two sets. Adhesive included. Reusable. Tiggy look: Eylure Flicklash looked great but were a little heavy . I was excited about trying these, as they promised extra-thick lashes and a perfect line of eyeliner in one fell swoop —perfect for women like me whose hands aren’t steady enough to apply their own. Like most ready-to-wear lashes, the strip had to be trimmed with nail scissors to the correct width of my eye. If the strip is too long, it will make your eye look droopy —the last thing I’m looking for. Usually, you trim any excess from the outside, but these must be trimmed from the inside, as the outer flick has been shaped into a thin point to elongate the eye. Make sure you peel backing paper from the flick before applying glue to the whole strip from corner to corner, including the flick. I left the glue for 30 seconds, until  it was tacky, before applying. Once the lashes were on, they felt a little stiff, scratchy and heavy on my lids, but they gave a Sixties, bright-eyed Twiggy look and they didn’t come loose with wear. SCORE: 4/5 . From £6.95, laurensway.com Lash glue included. The only way is false: Lauren's Way Midnight Diva lashes give a sophisticated and natural look . The girls from TV show The Only Way Is Essex are known for their huge, spidery lashes and these ones come from a range endorsed by TOWIE star Lauren Goodger. In the box, the strip of eyelashes looked thick and scarily long. But once on, I was blown away. The exaggerated outer flick gave a sophisticated look, which made me look glamorous, without being WAG-like. They looked natural, felt light and I didn’t have to hide the strip with any eyeliner. I forgot I was wearing them after a few minutes and they stayed firmly put. SCORE: 4/5 . From £2.74, ardelllashes.com . The winner: Ardell Duralash lashes were so light Kim forgot she was wearing them! There are 56 individual lashes in the box in a choice of short, medium or long, so you can create a bespoke look. I added five medium lashes to each eye, but you could use more for a dramatic look. It’s a lot fiddlier than applying a strip, but worth the effort as the result is amazing. Ardell recommends pouring a pea-size drop of adhesive on to a piece of tinfoil, before using tweezers to lift a lash from the tray and gently sweeping the base of the lash through the adhesive. Then, using a magnifying mirror, I applied each lash over one of my own, as close to my lash roots as possible without touching my eyelid. I gently supported the lash with my fingertip for a few seconds until the adhesive set, working towards the outer corner of the eye. I then returned to the centre and worked inward until the lashes blended. For a natural look, use the longer lashes on the outside of your eye, and the shorter as you work towards the bridge of your nose. It took me 15 minutes to do both eyes, but it was worth the extra effort as they stay in place for up to two weeks. I absolutely loved the result. Not only did they look natural, filling in sparse areas, but they were so light that I forgot I was wearing them. SCORE: 5/5 .","Kim Carillo tries out Eylure, Lauren's Way and Ardell Duralash eyelashes .

"By . Louise Cheer . This is the controversial banner which could be removed by council in the local area of Evans Head . It is a sight often seen on the beaches of Evans Head but signs with a bikini-clad teenager walking across with her surfboard has caused a wave of controversy. The image appeared on promotional banners in a main street in Evans Head - a coastal town in northern New South Wales. But Richmond Valley Council - which takes in Evans Head - has taken down the signs after receiving a complaint from a constituent who said it was inappropriate. The move by the council has caused such a stir that there is now a petition to re-instate the banners. So far, it has garnered 160 signatures, with the target set at 400 - which petition organiser Petria Powell said would be a good representation of the views of the 3,000-strong town. The girl at the centre of the drama is teenage athlete Kirrah Cooke, 17, who is a local identity. Kirrah represents the region in longboarding, soccer and cross country, and said she was shocked by the reaction. 'I feel that it’s kind of ridiculous because we live in a real beachy community and you see it everywhere,' she said. 'Just because a minority were against it, it was taken down - I just don’t understand why that would happen. 'We live in a democratic society, so you think a majority would rule. 'Whoever complained, they must be unaware of the beach culture that we live in here.' Kirrah said the move to remove the signs was sexist. 'People see things so differently if a guy was topless. In my mind, if it was a guy no one would have complained,' she said. 'If anything, it's was promoting female surfing and a healthy lifestyle.' Kirrah Cooke, the young woman featured on the poster doesn't see why the image is offensive in such a beachy communitiy . The removal of the signs has caused such a stir that Evans Head business owner Petria Powell has started up a petition to reinstate them. The Muzza's Milk Bar owner said she was angered by the move.

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Louise Cheer . A teenage racing driver has been rushed to hospital with critical burns after his car flipped in a practice session at a western Sydney race track. The 17-year-old Queenslander, Brock Giblin, was driving a Mazda 3 MPS when it rolled several times at Sydney Motorsport Park on Friday morning, a statement released by Shannons Australian Motor Racing Nationals said. Paramedics were called to Eastern Creek race track just before 11am to attend to the teenager who drives for Osborne Motorsport. But not before his 'brave' team mates, Ryan McLeod and Matt Cherry, attempted to help Giblin who was trapped inside the vehicle after the car flipped and burst into flames. Eventually he was freed by emergency service crews. Brock Giblin (right), was set to race with Nick Lange (left) in Sunday's Australian 4 Hour Race . Osborne Motorsport owner Colin Osborne said Giblin had 'experienced significant burns' but was in a 'serious but stable' condition. 'At the present time, investigations at the hospital indicate that his burn injuries are the only area of concern,' he said in a statement. 'Brock is currently being readied for transfer to a specialist burns unit in Sydney.' Mr Osborne said the precise cause of the accident was under investigation but it was 'apparent' that fire the result of the accident not the cause. He is a Year 11 student at Maleny State High School on the Sunshine Coast and had just joined the racing team . Giblin suffered burns to 70 per cent of his body when his car rolled several times at Sydney Motorsport Park . He added: 'We are confident that the cars construction, safety devices and the drivers safety apparel did their job to restrict any further injuries to Brock.' Mr Osbourne said Giblin's father and team members were by the driver's bedside. 'Our thoughts are with Brock and his family at this time, and we hope for a quick recovery,' he said. 'The team has not yet decided if it will continue to participate in the Australian Manufacturers Championship round this weekend.' The Osborne Motorsport team - including Giblin - were set to compete on Sunday in a round of the Shannons National circuit. He was driving a Mazda 3 MPS at the time of the accident on Friday morning . The young driver was transported to Westmead Hospital with reports that he has burns to 70 per cent of his body. Richard Craill, media manager for the Shannons Australian Motor Racing Nationals series, told Drive.com the car had just performed a 'super-fast turn' before it went up in flames. The teenager, from Landsborough on the Queensland's Sunshine Coast, joined the race team this year and is a Year 11 student at Maleny State High School. In April, after finishing third in his class and seventh overall in his first race as part of the Australian Manufacturers Championships in Sandown, in Victoria, he gave an interview to ABC radio Sunshine Coast descibing the feeling of racing as 'magnificent'. He also said he started racing by 'paddock bashing' around the family property in a Holden Barina.

"By . John Hall . At one time the Art Deco stylings of this abandoned hotel would have been the height of fashion - but now the building stands as a crumbling monumentto another era. Built in 1938, the deserted Royal York Hotel in Ryde, Isle of Wight quickly became a popular destination for high-society holiday-makers but was forced to close in 2006 due to a dwindling number of guests. Today the hotel stands ruined and abandoned, but retaining the same period features that made it popular. Urban explorer Darren Finch, 26, went inside the dilapidated but 'beautiful and spooky' building to take these stunning photographs. 'It was really nice to walk around thinking of all the families who must have good memories of happy times there... But at times the old corridors made the hotel look like a scene from The Shining,' he said. Despite being a fixture on the Ryde skyline for more than 75 years, the building may not be around much longer as a recent application details proposals to turn the site into a new 30-bed hotel and four flats. Scroll down for video . History: The Royal York Hotel's kitchen appears to be crumbling after half a decade of neglect. The historic building was built in 1938 to replace a Victorian hotel of the same name. At the time the Isle of Wight was a very popular holiday destination . Garish: In the 1970s the hotel underwent re-modelling to appeal to younger customers, despite the fact that many were by then choosing to holiday abroad . Protected: So many classic 1930s Art Deco features remain inside the hotel that it was registered as a grade II listed building in 1998 . Empty: Towards the end of its life the Royal York Hotel was only open during the summer, before it finally closed down forever in 2006 . Forgotten: An old wheelchair sits in the ballroom in the abandoned Royal York Hotel on the Isle of Wight. The hotel closed its doors for the final time in 2006 . Dirty: Plates, some of them still unwashed, are piled high in the hotel's now filthy restaurant kitchen. Plaster has started falling from the ceiling in the room . Future: Despite being a fixture on the Ryde skyline for over 75 years, the Art Deco building may not be around much longer as a recent application details proposals to turn the site into a new 30-bed hotel and four flats . Memories: As these old framed advertisements testify, the Royal York Hotel was once a popular destination for high-society holiday-makers in the 1930s . Stunning: The hotel boasted an impressive, if a little dated, spiral staircase. The stairs are it by a glass skylight and tall curved windows . Classic: Although the hotel stands ruined and abandoned, it retains many of the Art Deco features that made it incredibly popular in the 1930s . Abandoned: The hotel features a derelict terraced lounge bar and restaurant, a games rooms (pictured) and three floors of bedrooms .

"By . Tom Gardner . Only ghostly reminders now remain where once there would have been rows upon rows of sick patients. New photographs have emerged of the long-abandoned St Gerard's Hospital in Warwickshire which for decades treated thousands of children struck down with potentially deadly TB. The site was closed in 1988 and has remained an eerie time warp to a period when the lethal bacterial infection that was spread by coughs and sneezes was endemic in Britain. Scroll down for video . Decay: A ward in St. Gerard's Hospital in North Warwickshire, which was set up to treat TB, lies eerily silent having been abandoned in 1988 . Haunting: Look past the flaking paint and crumbling ceilings and the building which was once St. Gerard's Hospital in North Warwickshire still bears the unmistakable signs of its previous use as a medical centre . Hospital beds still litter the wards. Bloodstained syringes, old bathtubs, discarded photographs and keepsakes from former patients now gather dust. A catholic priest helped establish what eventually became St Gerard's Hospital at the beginning of the 19th century to treat local orphans and destitute children. The facility soon became one of the centres treating TB - playing a part in helping to cut the number of cases from 50,000 a year in Britain in the 1950s, to 5,000 in the 1980s. Abandoned: An old wheelchair, left, and a bath tub, right, gather dust in the once bustling St Gerard's Hospital in North Warwickshire which once used to treat the local children and disadvantaged people for a host of ailments including the bacteria infection TB which was endemic in Britain for much of the previous century . Frozen in time: Syringes and an old photograph lie discarded on one of the old hospital beds left inside the abandoned St. Gerard's Hospital in North Warwickshire . Treatment: A patient's x-ray left inside the abandoned hospital hints at a past when this facility would have been a hive of activity caring for hundreds of patients . TB used to be known as consumption because the bacterium ate holes in the lungs. From 50,000 cases a year in Britain in the 1950s, the rate fell to 5,000 in the 1980s. It is a bacterial infection which is spread by inhaling drops of saliva when an infected person coughs, speaks or sneezes. The . disease mainly affects the lungs, but can travel to other parts of the . body including the brain, kidneys, bones and joints. The disease is . curable with a six-month course of antibiotics, but a drug-resistant . form can develop if the course is not completed. Left untreated it can . prove fatal. Symptoms include a persistent cough that lasts for more . than three weeks that gets progressively worse, unexplained weight loss, . fever, night sweats, chest pain, fatigue and loss of appetite. However, . many people who are infected never develop symptoms - although the . bacteria remain in the body, they are not infectious. During the 1940s, when tuberculosis was widespread it was common to see 'Spitting Prohibited' signs on the buses. By 1990 the by-law was phased out, but a new sure in cases of TB has prompted some local authorities to again prohibit spitting in public places. These eerie photographs were captured . by an urban explorer known as Urbex-SW, who took up photography after . becoming intrigued by the abandoned contents of the derelict houses . close to his childhood home. 'These photographs show the hospital as it was when it was abandoned back in 1988,' says Urbex-SW. 'Medicine bottles, syringes, wheelchairs and hospital beds have all been left behind - all that's missing are the patients. 'You . always see old mental asylums pop up in the media, but nobody really . pays much attention to these small old hospitals that treated life . threatening illnesses. 'It was a place that I couldn't resist visiting. 'The most interesting thing I saw inside was the old fashioned wheelchair, as it's not something you see every day. 'Hospital beds are pretty much the same, but you could tell straight away that the wheelchairs dated back a fair few years.' St. Gerard's Hospital was built during the 1900s, and was used for the . treatment of tuberculosis and more specifically for practice in the . field of orthopedics. The . building still features its original barn like doors, which could be . fully opened to allow air into the building or even wheel the hospital . beds out into the open. 'With . locations like this, most people are shocked to see hospital equipment . dating back to the 1900s just left behind rotting away. 'There were loads of hospital beds, drawings by previous patients and a few post cards. 'There were also old X-Ray images, cameras and even medicine bottles, just left behind for the foreseeable future.' St . Gerard’s Orthopaedic Hospital was part of Father Hudson's Society which . was set up to offer services for orphaned children and pupils at local . boys' school in the early to mid 1900's. Father . Hudson was The Birmingham Diocesan Rescue Society for the protection of . homeless and friendless catholic children first secretary and . administrator. Under his . stewardship the organisation set out to build hospitals and care . facilities for children from all catholic homes in the diocese and the . catholic children from the workhouse hospitals. Hopes . that the disease could be completely eliminated were dashed in the . 1980s with the rise of drug-resistant strains. Tuberculosis cases in . Britain, numbering around 117,000 in 1913, had fallen to around 5,000 in . 1987, but cases rose again, reaching 6,300 in 2000 and 7,600 cases in . 2005.

"By . Wills Robinson . A top Roman Catholic state school attended by Nick Clegg's eldest son and two of Tony Blair's has been ordered to revise its 'discriminatory' admissions policy and accept children from less-privileged backgrounds. The London Oratory School has been heavily criticised by the Office of the Schools Adjudicator (OSA) for engaging in 'social selection', saying their entrance system had broken admission rules in 105 ways. It prioritised children based on whether they sing in the choir, arrange flowers in church, serve at the altar or assist in pastoral work such as visiting the needy. Condemned: The London Oratory school has been criticised for engaging in 'social selection'. The Office of the Schools Adjudicator (OSA) said it had broken admission rules in 105 ways . In its ruling, the watchdog said the school must not prioritise places for children 'on the basis of any practical or financial support parents may give to the school', nor should children be favoured on the basis of their hobbies and activities. The school, which is heavily over-subscribed and offers education to boys aged between seven and 18 and girls aged between 16 and 18, has been told it must alter its admissions policy so as not to discriminate against people from working-class or non-Catholic backgrounds. In the damning report, published today, its author Dr Bryan Slater said: 'From the evidence which I have seen there is good reason to believe that the admission arrangements which the school uses have the effect of acting to produce at the very least a degree of social selection. 'I am not convinced that the school can claim a high level of ethnic diversity in real terms since it is clearly less ethnically diverse than other schools in the place in which it is located.' It said of the 13 state-funded Catholic secondary schools in the nearby area, London Oratory has the highest proportion of white British pupils, the lowest proportion of non-white pupils, and the lowest proportion of those of African heritage. Pupils: Antonio Clegg, 12, the eldest son of atheist Lib Dem leader Nick (pictured left), attends the top Roman Catholic school, which is heavily over-subscribed . Dr Slater said: 'It seems to me instead that the diversity within the school is the lowest, or very nearly the lowest, of that found in all 13 schools.' He said that the percentage of children receiving free school meals - often an indicator of poverty - was 6-7 per cent. This is well down on the most recent figures for the borough, at 25.1 per cent. Mr Clegg's son eldest Antonio, 12, attends, while former prime minister Tony Blair sent his two eldest sons, Nicky and Euan, to the school with daughter Kathryn believed to have joined in the sixth form. A DfE spokesperson said: 'All schools must abide by an adjudicator's determination. We expect them to amend their arrangements to comply at the earliest opportunity.' Nobody from the school was able to comment. Tony Blair's eldest sons Euan, now 30, (middle) and Nicky, now 28, (right) are former pupils of the school. They are pictured with their mother Cherie at the 2006 Labour Party Conference in Manchester . A complaint by the British Humanist Association (BHA) was original upheld last August before being quashed in January on a technicality. BHA spokesman Richy Thompson described today's announcement as 'the most comprehensive we have ever seen'. He said: 'The London Oratory School is one of the ten most socio-economically selective state secondary schools in England. 'It is vital that no school discriminates against any pupil on the basis of religion, ethnicity or social standing and we are glad that the school must now rewrite its admissions policy to lessen the degree of discrimination on all fronts.'","London Oratory School has been accused of engaging in 'social selection'

"By . Sam Webb . These eerie images were taken inside an abandoned arms factory used in World War Two to make mustard gas and help develop the atomic bomb. Hidden away in rural North Wales, Rhydymwyn Valley is the only site of its type that was not discovered by Nazi intelligence. It is thought that the site was almost impossible to see from the air because of its proximity to woodland, so it escaped the wrath of Hitler's bombers. In the 1950s  Britain relinquished its chemical weapons capability and the site was used by various governmental . departments for storage until it closed in 1994. But the site still has many items from when it was in operation, such as a worker's jacket - with a pack of cigarettes still inside the pocket - found hanging among the ancient machines. Scroll down for video . Hidden history: This site in the Rhydymwyn Valley, North Wales, was used to manufacture deadly chemical weapons and help develop enriched uranium . Sinister: The interior of the building. Workers were churning out 40,000 mustard gas shells - a deadly chemical weapon - every week in November 1942 . Photographer Mathew Growcoot, from Birmingham, uncovered numerous artefacts as he explored the abandoned site, including a cabinet of old documents detailing the site's layout and specific building requirements. 'It was an incredible place to be. You could feel the history surrounding you, especially when you see documents and old items of clothing,' said Mr Growcoot, 24. 'I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the jacket hanging up, I took it outside so I could photograph it in the light and that's when I felt the pack of cigarettes in the pocket. 'It really brought the place to life, I think all history students should get up close and personal with their subject like I did.' Echoes of history: An old pack of cigarettes in a jacket pocket at the abandoned chemical weapons factory. The buildings are strewn with relics from the site's heyday . An old jacket hangs among the machinery. The plant was built in 1939, the outset of the Second World War, by the British Government at the cost of £546,000 . Clandestine: The well-hidden site was the only facility if its type to escape detection by the German military machine. Cover from surrounding woodland and its valley location helped keep it safe . The building used for the A-bomb and some of other buildings are now Grade-II listed. The valley itself is in a U-shape and extremely narrow so easily missed from the sky . Mustard gas is a chemical weapon that causes large blisters wherever it contacts the skin. It was especially deadly as it can penetrate clothing, so it is not only the exposed skin of victims that gets burned. If the victim's eyes were exposed it can result in temporary blindness and if inhaled, it causes bleeding and blistering within the lungs. It was fired at troops using artillery shells and bombs. A British nurse treating soldiers with mustard gas burns during the First World War described the horrific effects. She said: 'They cannot be bandaged or touched. We cover them with a tent of propped-up sheets. Gas burns must be agonising because usually the other cases do not complain, even with the worst wounds, but gas cases are invariably beyond endurance and they cannot help crying out.' On August 27th 1939, the UK Treasury . approved the £546,000 development of the top secret chemical weapons . plant and by November 1942 workers were manufacturing 40,000 25lb . mustard gas shells every week. And between 1942 and 1944 scientists . there worked on ways of producing the enriched uranium necessary for the . atomic bomb. Some went on to be involved with the Manhattan Project; . the American Government's race to build an atomic bomb before Germany . and Japan. Workers who handled mustard gas, a chemical weapon that causes large blisters to exposed skin and lungs, had to strip completely on arrival to work. One worker recalled: 'Once we'd stripped off, we were given a bath towel to walk into the department, where you put the work's clothing on.' The last known person alive to have worked on the site is Rosina Parry, who in March 2010 gave a television interview in which she described her role as a weapons inspector. She told the BBC: 'The bombs were laid . out for us to inspect. We had to pass them, to make sure they weren't . damaged in any way. We checked they weren't leaking before they were . sent through to be packed. 'We knew you couldn't have any leaks. You only needed a little spot and you'd be burned. 'People . in the air force were going to handle them after us so we had to be . sure there was nothing wrong with them when they went out.' The . site was an excellent location because of the River Alyn, which was . extensively canalised along with a rail network that was established . using the mainlines of Chester and Denbigh. Sinister purpose: The rusting and forgotten machines. From 1942 the plant worked on ways of enriching uranium -  a key component of the atomic bomb . Warning: A sign at the entrance to one of the large hanger-like buildings on the site. Workers handled mustard gas, a chemical weapon that causes large blisters to exposed skin and lungs . Horror: Mustard gas is a debilitating and potentially fatal gas weapon, used to infamous effect extensively in the First World war . A worker who handled the mustard gas weapons and checked them for leaks was interviewed about her vital role. She said: 'We knew you couldn't have any leaks. You only needed a little spot and you'd be burned' Derelict: A cabinet with documents surrounding it inside Building 45, a Grade-II listed building where early development on the atomic bomb took place .

"By . Stuart Woledge . and Simon Tomlinson . It is perhaps fitting that these prisons - which US convicts would once have called home - have themselves been abandoned and left to rot. The images, taken by US photographer Matthew Christopher, show two deserted institutions: Old Essex County Jail in Newark, New Jersey, and Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia. The 35-year-old has captured the sense of despair that so many of the lags incarcerated behind the walls of the two jails would almost certainly have felt. It is as if the prisons themselves have been sentenced to a lifetime of rust. Scroll down for videos .

Bustling: The entrance to the cafeteria at Old Essex County Jail, where convicts would once have filed in and out for their unappatising prison food . Dreaming of Release: The light shines down from a lit in the ceiling of a cramped cell in Holmesburg Prison, Philadelphia . Philadelphia's county jail, Holmesburg Prison, earned a reputation for brutal conditions. A 1922 expose by the Evening Public Ledger branded it 'the worst prison in the United States. Built in 1896, prisoners were often kept in solitary confinement and only allowed 20 minutes of exercise each day. According to website Hidden City, the prison was exposed for the 'bake-oven murders' in 1938. Guards were found to have been putting prisoners into a small building fitted with steam radiators, where they would turn up the heat to full blast. Inmates called it the 'Klondike'. Four prisoners died one hot August weekend, after temperatures inside reached almost 200 degrees. An investigation by the governor of Pennsylvania following a local police cover-up resulted in involuntary manslaughter convictions for the deputy warden and guard. In the 1950s, medical testing a programme of medical testing began at Holmesburg. Hidden city claims experiments were carried out on inmates on behalf of private clients. The CIA was also said to have tested more than a dozen psychotropic drugs there during the course of a decade. The programme ended in 1974. In 1973, two prisoners stabbed warden Patrick Curran and his deputy Robert Fromhold to death. The current county jail, Curran-Fromhold Correctional Center, was named after them. Holmesburg finally closed its doors in 1995. Cell: A bed sits by the window, which the . occupant would have spent much of his time gazing from (left).

Graffiti has been daubed on the wall (left) The Old Essex County Jail Complex was designed by architect John Haviland and opened its doors in 1837. Also . known as Newark Street Jail, it was located over two storeys and had . 300 cells, with each one fitted with running water and toilet . facilities. But when a new prison was opened in 1970, Old Essex was closed down. According to Forbidden Places website, it is the oldest building in the county and is on the national register of historic places. In 1991 scenes for the Malcolm X, a film starring Denzil Washington, were shot at the prison. Ten years later a fire took hold in the building causing considerable damage. Nothing . is being done to bring the building back into use, and it is said to be . a retreat for squatters, dealers and drug-addicts. Solitary confinement: One of the last prisoners to occupy this cell ticked off the days until he was released. He clearly believes he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice .

Cafeteria: The crumbling bricks, paintwork, and debris on the floor disguise the fact this used to be the place where inmates ate their meals. A sign on the far wall warns that all kitchen staff must wash their hands . Matthew, who lives in . Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, began his journey to document abandoned . sites a decade ago while researching the decline of the state hospital . system. He said: 'I . want to be able to convey the respect, appreciation and awe that I have . for the locations I visit. Trying to tell someone about a place conveys . so little compared to being able to show it to them. 'My . favourite part of exploring ruins is that to me, it is peaceful. I can . focus on what I am seeing and experiencing rather than being wrapped up . in my thoughts all the time. 'Discovering . new or intriguing places, finding something you know not many people . have seen, or managing to get permission to somewhere you'd really like . to see are also a lot of fun. 'These places also help me appreciate the comforts of the waking world when I return to it.' Open wide: A dental chair, complete with check-up equipment has been abandoned. One can only guess at how gentle the dentist would have been . Realising that words alone could not adequately convey the harsh realities of institutional care, Matthew embarked on a journey to visit and photograph crumbling state schools and asylums all over the US. Ten years later, Matthew's focus has broadened to include the ruins of American infrastructure, industry, churches, schools, theaters, hospitals, prisons, resorts and hotels. He Added: 'The Baltimore Gas and Electric's Westport Power Station was a favourite of mine, but I love different things about each place I've visited. 'Sometimes it can get scary, especially if a place is really structurally unstable, that would probably be my biggest concern. I also don't want to get murdered for my camera gear or arrested. 'There have been several occasions where I have had close calls with security and police, but thankfully nothing that has ever proven to be a long-term issue. 'I try to be very quiet and careful to avoid anybody when I am photographing a location, and if I do run into anyone am polite and respectful, I try to get across the fact that I am not vandalising, damaging, or stealing anything. I have been lucky that so far that has been enough.' Derelict: Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia has been abandoned for so long, even the graffiti is now peeling off the wall along with the plaster . From Taunton State Hospital in Massachusetts to the US Air Force's aircraft graveyard in Tucson, Arizona, Matt's extensive collection of derelict sites is one of the largest ever amassed. His work has gained international attention and he is considered a leading expert on urban blight and the efforts to preserve America's endangered architectural history. 'I do quite a bit of research about the locations to try to find them. I also get tips from people who follow my work, and network with others who have similar interests. 'I am very fortunate to have a fantastic family that has never discouraged me from doing what I do and has been very supportive of it all along. 'Many of my friends are the same way, although there are certainly those that just don't find it interesting or follow it as much and we get along for other reasons. 'My current goal is figuring out new ways to make sites more accessible and raise funds for site maintenance or restoration efforts, as well as continuing to add to the amount of locations I photograph. 'I am typically pretty busy, always working out how to take things one step further and help people understand what is so important about them, both historically and in terms of their cultural significance to our own era.'","Photographer Matthew Christopher has captured the haunting atmosphere of the once feared institutions .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Homebuyers' confidence in the housing market is at its lowest since April 2011 after being dented by soaring prices and fears over higher interest rates, a report shows today. The proportion of people who believe now is ‘a good time to buy’ has fallen to its lowest level for at least three years, according to mortgage lender Halifax. More than a third of people asked, or 35 per cent, said rising house prices were a barrier to buying, up from just 20 per cent a year ago. Scroll down for video . Barriers: Soaring house prices are putting people off making offers on houses, a Halifax survey found . Nearly one in five, or 18 per cent, said they were worried about rises in interest rates, up from 13 per cent a year ago. But raising a deposit remains the biggest barrier to buying, with 55 per cent citing it as a major hurdle. Experts said confidence in the housing market had reached ‘a tipping point’. The Halifax Housing Market Confidence tracker found that 47 per cent of people thought it was a good time to buy, while 42 per cent believed it was a bad time to buy. Although more are positive about purchasing, experts say it is the balance of five between the figures that is significant. It is the lowest since the survey started in April 2011 and has plunged from 34 during the first three months of the year. On top of these figures, the International Monetary Fund is expected to sound the alarm today over the housing market – just days after predicting that Britain will be the fastest growing major economy in the developed world. The IMF expects the economy to grow by 3.2 per cent this year – nearly double the 1.7 per cent expansion forecast for the US. But in a report on the UK, it is likely to repeat its warning that a housing bubble could derail the recovery. Worried: Nearly a fifth of people say they fear the impending hike in mortgage rates, now at an all-time low . The average price of a home in Britain has risen by more than 10 per cent in the last 12 months to £262,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. Prices in London are up more than 20 per cent to £492,000, but it said ‘hotspots’ with particularly strong gains had popped up in Salford, Greater Manchester; Brough, East Yorkshire; and St Leonards-On-Sea in East Sussex. The recovery in the housing market and the wider economy has raised the prospect that interest rates will increase before the end of the year, having been frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned last week that as the economy normalises, the rate will need to rise. According to the Halifax, people in London and the South East, where homes are more expensive, were the most negative about buying a property, while those living in Scotland and the North East were the most positive. But while concerns about buying a home have increased, confidence about selling has never been higher, it said. Some 57 per cent of people think now is a good time to sell, while 32 per cent think it is a bad time – giving a balance of 25. Craig McKinlay, mortgages director at Halifax, said: ‘Over the past two years consumer confidence has continued to grow. However it appears that we’ve reached a tipping point, with the equilibrium between buyers and sellers much more out of sync.’ Howard Archer, of research group IHS Global Insight, said: ‘While house prices look likely to keep rising over the coming months, it looks probable there will be some moderation.’","Halifax survey found market confidence is lowest since April 2011 .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Couples who want to stay together should learn to run a bath for each other, according to advice yesterday from a taxpayer-funded relationships campaign. Little gestures can demonstrate commitment, smooth over conflict, and build strong and healthy relationships, it claimed. The ‘love nuggets’ programme is urging couples to make cups of tea for each other; leave notes around the house for a spouse to find; or take their other half to the cinema even when they don’t want to see the film themselves. Scroll down for video . The happiest day of his life as he puts a ring on the hand of the lady he loves (File photo) It is being paid for by the Department for Education, which has provided special funding nearly £3million to the OnePlusOne relationship charity to ‘encourage couples to take proactive steps to strengthen their relationship from the start, rather than allowing it to reach crisis point before seeking support.’ The campaign comes complete with a website on which couples can find a ‘love nuggets generator’, which, the charity said, will provide inspiration with random suggestions of gestures by which couples can perk up their own love lives. But the scheme came in for criticism from relationship analysts who believe high levels of marriage breakdown need deeper solutions than advice on whether to make your spouse a cup of tea. The ‘love nuggets’ campaign has been launched at a time when the low chance that a cohabiting couple will stay together means nearly half of all young teenagers live with just one of their birth parents. Harry Benson of the Marriage Foundation think tank said: ‘The Government should be encouraging relationships education. But I think ‘love nuggets’ falls short.’ The campaign, which is described as ‘a quest to uncover and celebrate the everyday things people do that make a happy relationship’. A man taking his girlfriend to the cinema to see a romantic film he feels he may not enjoy is said to be ‘a great example of a compromise’. Women need their beauty sleep and they are told to dress to impress, to show that even after years they still want to look good when out with their man . Women are told they might put their arm around their man when they are out in public, even when they are talking to someone else. They might also make creative presents, such as a compilation of photos and a favourite song to go with them. Women are also told to dress to impress, to show that even after years they still want to look good when out with their man. Men might consider providing their wife with breakfast in bed on a Saturday morning, or stroking their girlfriend’s hair while she falls asleep. The Prince of Wales offers his congratulations to newlyweds Barry and Kirstie Rooney from Patna in Ayrshire . Penny Mansfield of OnePlusOne said: ‘It is easy to get caught up in the larger issues that relationships tend to throw up and, in doing so, overlook the smaller, more subtle things that do really matter and can help keep a relationship healthy and strong. ‘It ‘s these small acts that help us to connect with our lover, demonstrate our commitment, improve communication, show we care, achieve compromise and even resolve conflicts. ‘We want people to recognise the value of the simple gestures and to give others ideas of everyday things they could be doing to strengthen a relationship. We want to find out what some of the most common examples are as well as some of the more unusual love nuggets.’ The charity, which is largely state-funded, has been paid £2.7million by the Education Department for its efforts to strengthen relationships, with another payment from the ministry on top for ‘on-line services’. Ladies, don't let romance die - he can't help the snoring (File photo) A series of other groups are supporting the campaign, including Netmums, dad.info and youth websites. However Mr Benson said: ‘It doesn’t hurt to give hints and tips. ‘But it is so much better if people start their relationship on a secure basis in the first place, most obviously by getting married. The number one predictor of whether people will stay together in the long term is whether they get married. If you don’t the chances of sticking together are slim.’","The ‘love nuggets’ programme is urging couples to make cups of tea for each other and leave notes around the house for a spouse to find .

"By . Daniel Bardsley . Covered in graffiti and with every window smashed, this is the crumbling Russian village in the Czech Republic that was abandoned two decades ago at the end of the Cold War. Eerily quiet today, it once bustled with hundreds of residents but all the workers and their families went back home to Russia after the Iron Curtain came down. Named Bozi Dar, which is Czech for God's Gift, the village was built after Soviet forces invaded what was then Czechoslovakia in 1968. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Derelict: The abandoned town of Bozi Dar in the Czech Republic which has been empty since the end of the Cold War. There were once hundreds of residents but they went home to Russia after the Iron Curtain came down . Cold War hangover: Until the town was abandoned two decades ago, Bozi Dar in the old Czechoslovakia used to be heavily guarded because it housed a top secret Soviet military base . Thousands lived in the pale grey Communist-style apartment blocks and nearby military barracks, and the village had its own cinema, powerplant and farmland. Before the Russians abandoned Bozi Dar and a military airfield next door in 1991, the residents were mostly isolated from the Czechs in the nearby village of Milovice, which lies across the countryside on the other side of the airfield. The village used to be heavily guarded because it was part of a top-secret Soviet military base rumoured to house nuclear warheads, but today there are only warning signs and flimsy pieces of plastic tape to discourage visitors from entering. Barely visible from the main road, Bozi Dar, which is about 30 miles north east of Prague, now mainly attracts graffiti artists, vandals and the occasional curious tourist. Many buildings have become concrete shells, with broken glass, rusting oil barrels and smashed-up desks littering the floors. One or two have been torched by local tearaways. But the village does still offer up reminders of its long-departed residents. Wooden beds can be found in a few of the flats, while pieces of old lavatory cisterns litter the floor in the hallways. Wasteland: Named Bozi Dar, which is Czech for God's Gift, the village was built after Soviet forces invaded what was then Czechoslovakia in 1968. Just over two decades later it was abandoned . Eerie: Barely visible from the main road, Bozi Dar, which is about 30 miles north east of Prague, now mainly attracts graffiti artists, vandals and the occasional curious tourist . Abandoned: Many buildings have become concrete shells, with broken glass, rusting oil barrels and smashed-up desks littering the floors. One or two have been torched by local tearaways . Underneath the wallpaper in most of the empty apartments, the walls are plastered with mid 1970s Russian newspapers, among them the Soviet Communist Party mouthpiece, Pravda. Many show pictures of soldiers, tanks and military manoeuvres on the front page, the papers trying to drum up patriotic enthusiasm among the masses. Pictures of the late former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, who ran the Soviet Union until he died in 1982, can be seen around the area. Some floors have a floral pattern to them, a rare decorative touch in an otherwise austere communist development. The village serves as a reminder of a chapter of history that still arouses anger among Czechs because it is tied in with their country's loss of sovereignty. Czechoslovakia had been communist since 1948, but in the late 1960s it became more liberal. Soviet armed forces invaded and occupied the country because they were concerned about the country's drift away from the Kremlin. Bozi Dar was built up as one of the Soviets' main military bases in the country, staffed by Russian personnel. Artistic graffiti: This graffiti offers a rare decorative touch to the dour Soviet architecture of the Eastern village that was built in the late 1960s . Soviet satellite village: Before the Russians abandoned Bozi Dar and a military airfield next door in 1991, the residents were mostly isolated from the Czechs in the nearby village of Milovice . Soviet newspapers: The walls of this grim apartment are he walls are plastered with mid 1970s Russian newspapers, among them the Soviet Communist Party mouthpiece, Pravda . When Mikhail Gorbachev introduced his glasnost reforms after becoming Soviet leader in 1985, democratic movements developed across Eastern Europe, led in Czechoslovakia by the playwright Vaclav Havel. In 1989, the country's 'Velvet Revolution' saw it break free of Soviet control and in subsequent years, with Havel now president, the occupying military forces headed home. In 1992, after the Soviet forces had left, Bozi Dar was handed back to the authorities in Czechoslovakia, which a year later split from Slovakia to become the Czech Republic. With little industry in the quiet countryside nearby, and with the land in and around the village said to be contaminated, major developers were not interested in the area, and the village has been left to its fate. Desolate: Wallpaper can be seen peeling off the walls of this wreck of an apartment. Behind it, the walls are lined with 1970s Soviet newspapers . Graffiti: Cut off from nearby towns inhabited by the Czechs, Bozi Dar was almost completely abandoned when the Soviets left at the end of the Cold War . Peeling: The wreck of a property in Bozi Dar, a crumbling Russian village in the Czech Republic that was abandoned two decades ago at the end of the Cold War . Soviet past: A close-up of the old Russian newspaper, from 1974, which lines the walls of the old Soviet apartment block in Bozi Dar . Newsprint: Another old newspaper from 1974 in the abandoned apartment in Czech Republic. In Bozi Dar there are today only warning signs and flimsy pieces of plastic tape discouraging visitors from entering . Plans to use the adjacent airport as a cargo hub never got off the ground and instead, the airfield is now used by small hobby aircraft that enthusiasts fly mostly at weekends. Workmen use the open spaces of the village as dumping grounds for tree trunks and branches cleared from the area. Next door to Bozi Dar, and fenced off from the former Russian village, are a handful of apartment blocks. Although a few residents walk their dogs in the ghost village, many regard it as an eyesore and a hazard. Much of the live ammunition said to have been left behind by the Russians has been disposed of by the Czech authorities. However, the vandalized apartments, with their balcony and staircase railings removed, along with anything else remotely valuable, are potential deathtraps, particularly for unwary children. Jiri Skopec, 32, a car industry project manager who lives in one of the blocks next to Bozi Dar, described the abandoned village as 'creepy'. 'It could be dangerous for children because they are curious. It would be better if they weren't there, these big buildings, but I don't know who's in charge of it all,' he said. Rather than knock the buildings down, all the authorities have done as a safety measure is to drape netting over the top storey of each of the blocks of flats. So for the foreseeable future, Bozi Dar looks set to remain as a chilling reminder of Cold War tensions. Derelict: Many buildings have become concrete shells, with broken glass, rusting oil barrels and smashed-up desks littering the floors. One or two have been torched by local tearaways .

"By . Rebecca Evans . It has been nine days since the Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down over a remote war-torn corner of eastern Ukraine. But as world leaders prevaricate over their response to an act of mass murder, the disgraceful failure to recover all 298 victims of flight MH17 was all too evident yesterday. Three generations of one Ukrainian family could be seen picking their way through the wreckage like people inspecting the aftermath of a storm. Scroll down for videos . Picking through the wreckage: A family of Ukrainians walk through the MH17 crash site which is still littered with victims' bodies, belongings and wreckage . Plundered: A child’s belongings spill out of an opened suitcase. It is one of many to have been rifled through at the crash site since the plane came down on July 17 . Many bodies are still lost in the fields of sunflowers that surround the area – and could remain until the 5ft high crops are harvested next month. But it is the inescapable stench of rotting flesh in 30C heat that is so distressing – at a site controlled by the same heavily armed pro-Russian rebels accused of destroying the Boeing 777 with a missile. It can only be guessed what the families of those who lost their lives on the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur must make of it all. Although the repatriation flights have begun, just 200 bodies and an unspecified number of body parts have so far been sent to the Netherlands for identification. Almost a third of the 298 killed – who included ten Britons – could still be missing and may never be found. The band of inexperienced Kalashnikov-wielding recruits in charge in this corner of Ukraine has refused access to international forensic experts. As a result, the crash scene – which stretches for miles across the farming villages of Rassypnoe, Grabovo and Petropavloka – remains in a state of ugly chaos. 59908 . 143802 . 60651 . 71425 . 29443 .

Painstaking: Malaysian experts check debris at the main crash site of the Boeing 777 Malaysia Airlines flight which came down in a remote war-torn corner of Ukraine . Assessment: Forensic . experts have spent days at the crash site, near . the village of Grabovo, to carry out investigations and attempt to locate the plane's black boxes . Persistent looting means vital evidence – and sentimental keepsakes – have been lost. Parts of the plane have been stolen to be sold as scrap. Giant pieces of fuselage are strewn for miles, along with twisted burnt metal, suitcases and clothing. Parts of the doomed jet’s cockpit lie surrounded by personal possessions that have clearly been tampered with or stolen from. Wallets – emptied of cash – lie next to children’s shoes and toys. A baby’s bottle rests by a pile of opened letters. Nearby, a collection of classical music is scattered across the charred ground. Also still visible are the remains of animals and birds from the jet’s hold, including pigeons, two dogs, peacocks and parrots. Some locals have begun to light candles around the debris and to lay teddy bears in memory of the 80 children who died. Retired miner Alexander Benayka, 57, who lives yards from the crashed cockpit, said many bodies are still hidden in the sunflowers as temperatures soar. Tragic: A toy teddy bear placed at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine, shows a mark of respect to the victims . Wreckage: The Malaysia Airlines flight was carrying 298 passengers when it came down over eastern Ukraine on July 17 . Tragic: One resident surveys the damage of MH17 which was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it came down over eastern Ukraine, killing all on board . The father of two, one of 200 volunteers told by the rebels to search for bodies, said: ‘You can smell them everywhere. It is too hot. There are also wild dogs here. The bodies will not last much longer. We need international forces to help search the site properly before it is too late. ‘The bodies are in the fields but you cannot see them for the sunflowers. We do not harvest until the end of August so unless someone comes to help, they will not be uncovered until then.’ Tears streaming down his face, Mr Benayka added: ‘I saw many dead children here by my house. I bring flowers and light candles as respect for them.’ Grieving relatives have told of how credit cards and mobile phones belonging to victims have been used since the crash. The Foreign Office yesterday said it will work with relatives to help protect against fraud. Respect: Funeral hearses carrying the first 40 victims of MH17 arrived at the Korporaal van Oudheusden Kazerne barracks in Hilversum, The Netherlands on Thursday . Tributes: Hundreds of flowers and tributes were laid n Eindhoven, Netherlands, as several of the bodies of the MH17 victims were transported back to the country . The crash investigation is being led by a Dutch team as 194 of those killed were from the Netherlands. Yesterday, a small group was able to visit part of the scene, while a group of 40 Dutch policemen are reported to be on their way to try to help secure the area. Some 90 Australian military police are on standby in London. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott fears some remains will never be recovered unless security is tightened. US Ambassador to the Ukraine Jeffrey Pyatt said the crash site is ‘a giant crime scene and needs to be treated that way.’ ‘Further destruction of the wreckage must be stopped. It’s tragic that the site has still not fully been secured,’ he added.","298 people were killed when the Malaysia Airlines plane came down in a war-torn area in eastern Ukraine on July 17 .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . No sooner has Mario Balotelli set foot on Brazilian soil than Italy's volatile striker is playing down England’s World Cup hopes and talking up his dreams of becoming the best player on the planet. Balotelli was not about to let the small matter of a draw with Luxemburg — the latest in a dismal run of results for Italy — disrupt his plans for world domination as he looked ahead to the eagerly anticipated Group D opener with Roy Hodgson’s side in Manaus on Saturday. As wildcards go, they do not come much wilder than Balotelli but the Italians are relying on their unpredictable front man hitting top form, just as he did in Euro 2012 when he finished joint leading scorer with three goals. Confident: Italy striker Mario Balotelli believes his side are better than World Cup opponents England . Preparation: Balotelli controls the ball under pressure from team-mate Alessio Cerci (right) during training . Typically, the AC Milan star is not lacking in confidence. ‘People will always want to talk about Mario, people always want to write about Mario, but I am used to that,’ said Balotelli. ‘Now is the time for me to do my talking, but I want to do my talking on the field. I still have dreams of being the best player in the world, and legends are made at the World Cup. ‘I totally believe that Italy can win the World Cup. I am realistic and know that maybe there are one or two teams who are operating at a level higher than us — but one of them are definitely not England. ‘I’m convinced that we can beat anybody. With the quality and experience we have, Italy are a team any nation should fear playing.’ Balotelli’s claims do not quite stack up on current form. Cesare Prandelli’s side have failed to win any of their last seven games, including draws with Armenia, Nigeria, Denmark and Republic of Ireland before Wednesday’s embarrassing flop, the 1-1 draw with Luxembourg, in Perugia. The Italians landed in Rio on Friday and will play their final warm-up game against Brazilian club Fluminense on Sunday. Prandelli insists there is nothing to worry about but he is unsure of his best formation, never mind starting line-up, with less than a week to go before the England game. However, the four-time World Cup winners are notoriously off-colour before major tournaments and Hodgson and his players will not need reminding about their painful European Championship defeat by Italy in Kiev two years ago. Decision time: Italy boss Cesare Prandelli has not yet picked his starting XI to face England . Getting ready: Giorgio Chiellini (left) and Ciro Immobile (second right) tussle for the ball in training on Saturday . Balotelli beat his former Manchester City team-mate Joe Hart in a penalty shootout and the 23-year-old is ready to be equally ruthless as the two men prepare to meet again in his first World Cup. ‘I am not even thinking that when we play England that I will be playing against former team-mates,’ he added. ‘When the game is over we will share a hug — but until the final whistle there can be no friendships.’ That shootout will always be remembered for Andrea Pirlo’s audacious chipped effort past Hart on a night when the Juventus playmaker was simply outstanding. The bad news for England is that, even at 35, Pirlo remains at the top of his game as he attempts to end his international career by winning the World Cup for a second time. ‘The feeling to represent your country in a World Cup is amazing, and the feeling when you win one is indescribable,’ said Pirlo. ‘I have already been fortunate enough to win the World Cup, and just maybe I can win one more.’ Memorable: Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo scores a chipped penalty past England's Joe Hart at Euro 2012 . The Italians experienced the heat of Brazil in last summer’s Confederations Cup, even though it will not compare to the stifling humidity of northernmost Manaus. During a training camp in Florence last week, Prandelli had his players training in a shed specially designed to replicate the oppressive conditions and Pirlo believes the European teams will have just as good a chance as their South American rivals. ‘I think a lot is being made about a European team never winning the World Cup in South America,’ he added. ‘I understand why Brazil are favourites, but with the quality of some of the European teams it is crazy to think it can’t happen. ‘You can’t just dismiss the heat. We played in the Confederations Cup last year and it does get very intense, but all the coaching staff and trainers will be doing everything they can to help the players combat it.’ Talent: Balotelli is looking to let his football do the talking after a number of controversial off-field incidents . Pirlo was rather more respectful of England than Balotelli, and, in particular, captain Steven Gerrard as the two veteran midfielders go head to head once again. He said: ‘Steven Gerrard is one of the great central midfield players of the generation, maybe the greatest. ‘Of course, as you get older you have to adapt your game, but he has proved he has got the intelligence to do that. When he finally decides to retire I think he will be put in the same class as players like Zidane and Scholes.’","Balotelli believes teams should fear Italy at the World Cup .

While well stocked on cones, Koeman seems to have little else as Southampton gear up for their opening Premier League fixture against Liverpool at Anfield on August 17. Many are predicting the Saints will struggle this season after their mass exodus, but maybe Koeman's undiminished enthusiasm is a sign he has an ace or two up his sleeve.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . It has been a World Cup rich in narrative – the heroes and villains jumping off the page - and on Sunday night one last act will be penned; it promises to be the captivating climax this tournament deserves. A record one billion people will devote 90 minutes – or more – to a television relaying the drama as it unfolds in the Maracana; make sure you’re one of them. For do not allow your memory of previous finals to erode enthusiasm ahead of this one. Relief: Argentina celebrate their penalty-shootout victory over Holland in the semi-final . Destruction: Germany humiliated hosts Brazil 7-1 in their semi-final . In South Africa, four years ago, the most tedious tournament of recent times got the final it deserved, 120 minutes of boredom and brutality between Spain and Holland settled at the death by Andres Iniesta, it even robbed us of a penalty shootout. This latest edition – thankfully – has been far removed from the depression of 2010. Even England’s early and entirely predictable exit has been forgotten amid the infectious, attacking spirit which has coursed through these finals. Even the lesser contests – notably a handful of knockout matches – have hurtled to a conclusion in much the same manner as a playground battle with the bell about to sound. Think the closing stages of Argentina 1 Switzerland 0, Germany 2 Algeria 1 and Belgium 2 USA 1 and there you have football stripped of tactics but laced with tension. There have been individuals - Colombia's James Rodriguez chief among them - underdogs - Costa Rica had bark and bite - upsets - Spain's demise and Brazil's capitulation the most shocking - goals - Robin van Persie's diving header this scribe's favourite - and a few baddies thrown in to darken the plot, he who now resides in Barcelona the most villainous of them all. Germany and Argentina, though, have been the best two teams in Brazil and boast the protagonists to ink a fitting finale. Lionel Messi, you suspect, has been keeping something back for this occasion, the genius which hauled his side through the group stage set to sparkle once more with the prize in sight. While Javier Mascherano carries the water, Messi turns it to wine and they will need their messiah to be at his mesmeric best to toast victory in Rio; the stage, as they say, is set. I(n the mood? Argentina will need Lionel Messi to be at his best if they're to triumph . Leg up: Five-goal Thomas Muller could prove the difference for Germany . Main men: Messi and Muller have been two of the best players on show in Brazil . The Bayern Wall: Manuel Neuer has been immense in goal for the Germans . Tackle of the tournament: Javier Mascherano denied Holland's Arjen Robben in the closing stages of the semi-final . But Germany are favourites for good reason. Their destruction of Brazil in the semi-finals made for a confusing cocktail of pain and pleasure as a viewer, but it left an undeniably moreish taste. On Sunday, we will get more.  We will get more of the 'Bayern Wall', Manuel Neuer, more of his club-mates Bastian Schweinsteiger and Toni Kroos, the men who tease passes and torment opponents, and more of Thomas Muller, the player of whom it is said doesn’t have a trick or turn of pace yet has still been the best in Brazil. That is the current vintage, factor in the history as well – this is their third final – and the stakes are heightened. It is 1-1 on finals won but Germany have proved Argentina’s nemesis in the last two tournaments, a 4-0 humiliation in South Africa sure to motivate Messi and Co. Indeed, as many as 18 of the players from Cape Town could feature on Sunday. If revenge serves as added motivation then so be it, but you get the feeling the incentive this time is far more pure – to be crowned champion of the greatest World Cup in living memory, certainly of the colour-television age. We are set for one last illumination so be sure not to miss it.","Joachim Low's Germany meet Argentina on Sunday in the World Cup final .

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Luke Shaw insists he has no problem putting the hard yards in to make sure he is fully fit for his first season as a Manchester United player. In a frank interview following United's penalty shootout win over Inter Milan, Shaw conceded manager Louis van Gaal had every right to criticise him over his lack of fitness. And the 19-year-old admitted he underestimated just how challenging it would be to make the step up from Southampton to Manchester United. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: Luke Shaw is nowhere near fit enough . In agreement: Luke Shaw has backed Louis van Gaal over claims about his lack of fitness . Personal trainer: Man United boss Van Gaal is keeping a close eye on summer signing Shaw . VIDEO Van Gaal forces Shaw to train alone . Van Gaal revealed at a press conference on Monday that he has had to devise a special training programme for Shaw, who turned up for pre-season out of shape after three weeks off. The Dutchman was clearly not too happy with Shaw given that he had only just sanctioned the teenager's expensive transfer from the south coast. Shaw has no qualms with his manager's public criticism of him. 'Obviously I have seen that, and it's something I totally agree with,' Shaw said when asked about Van Gaal's press conference comments. 'To play in this formation you have to be really fit. I am fit but I am not at the high level he demands. 'I have got to get fitter to get up and down (the wing). It's something I have got to work on.' Shaw became the fourth most expensive defender in history when he swapped Southampton for United in a deal that could cost the Old Trafford club £28million. Although he played for England at the World Cup, it is worth remembering Shaw only made his full Premier League debut in November 2012. International duty: Shaw played for England against Costa Rica at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Shaw admits he miscalculated just how physically demanding it would be to step up and become United's first-choice left wing-back as part of Van Gaal's new 3-5-2 system. 'It was a surprise. I didn't come into United thinking it would be much harder,' Shaw said. 'That's something that I think I made a mistake on. 'I thought it was just going to be the same but it's the biggest club in the world and there are world-class players in training. 'That is something that is going to push me on and it's something I am looking forward to doing.' To show just how much work he thinks Shaw needs to do, Van Gaal made the full-back partake in a gruelling fitness session on the morning of the win against Inter Milan, which came on penalties after a 0-0 draw. The England defender only made it onto the pitch when Reece James pulled out of the match with an injury. Shaw thinks the extra training sessions are already paying dividends. Running man: Shaw goes on a run during Man United's pre-season penalty shootout win against Inter Milan . 'I want and need the staff to push me on so they can do what they want. It will only help me in the long run,' said Shaw, who impressed as a second-half substitute at the FedEx Field in Washington. 'I wasn't meant to play (against Inter) so I trained on Tuesday morning. 'Me and the staff decided it would be better to push me in a harder training session. 'But I came on and played 45 minutes. I felt great. I could have played another 45 so that's something that shows there is a progression there after the last game. 'The focus is now to get fitter and fitter and to be flying by the start of the season.' Shaw and his Manchester United team-mates will fly to Detroit on Thursday ahead of their clash against Real Madrid, which is expected to take place in front of a crowd of over 100,000 people. A win for United, who beat Roma in their first match, will see them qualify for the final of the International Champions Cup, which takes place on August 4 in Miami.","Louis van Gaal believes Man United Luke Shaw needs to work on fitness .

The 46-year-old Romanian has been linked with Forza Rossa, a team from his home country that was recently granted an entry to take their place on the grid in 2015 or 2016. Former Dutch F1 driver Christijan Albers, assisted by a colleague of Kolles from their time together at HRT in Manfredi Ravetto, are to take over the day-to-day running of the team.

"Two Formula One world champions have become the latest to criticise Lewis Hamilton with regards to his attitude and comments throughout the course of the Monaco Grand Prix weekend. Hamilton refused to acknowledge Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg on the podium following the latter's second consecutive victory around the streets of the principality. That followed an incident in qualifying when Rosberg brought out the yellow flags, thwarting Hamilton in his bid to claim pole at a time when he was on a quicker lap than the German. VIDEO Scroll down to ride on board with Lewis Hamilton for a lap of the Monaco GP . Condemned: Lewis Hamilton has had his behaviour at Monaco criticised by many in F1 . Wrongdoing: Hamilton refused to acknowledge his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg on the podium . Starting from top spot on the grid proved crucial for Rosberg as he went on to win from lights to flag and return to the top of the drivers' standings, leaving Hamilton to settle for second. Hamilton, though, did not disguise his displeasure at the antics of Rosberg, even though the 28-year-old was cleared by the stewards. Mercedes non-executive chairman and three-times champion Niki Lauda chastised Hamilton after the race, suggesting that ignoring Rosberg was 'not good' and reflected badly on the Mercedes brand. Now John Surtees and Mika Hakkinen have waded into the debate and agree with Lauda that Hamilton's behaviour was unbecoming. Surtees, the only driver to win world titles on two and four wheels, said in his column in Motor Sport magazine: 'I have no doubt about Lewis Hamilton's driving ability, but I didn't like what I saw and heard from Monaco. 'I can understand the frustration Lewis must have felt in not having that opportunity on the last lap of qualifying to get pole. 'But I think his reaction to his team-mate and team was wrong.' Hakkinen, who won two titles with McLaren in 1998 and 1999, believes Hamilton displayed the attitude of a sore loser. In his column for Hermes, Hakkinen said: 'It's hard to tell if something is going to change significantly (between the drivers). 'I don't know if Lewis would even consider apologising for his behaviour. It is a very individual thing. 'But in my opinion, one of the characteristics of a good winner is he also knows how to lose.' Unimpressed: Former world champion Mika Hakkinen believes Hamilton displayed the attitude of a poor loser . Wrong: And John Surtees (left) was equally unimpressed with the attitude of Hamilton at Monaco . Surtees, now 80, believes Hamilton was also wrong to highlight his upbringing as a source of motivation compared to that of Rosberg. Hamilton suggested he was hungrier than Rosberg as he was raised on a council estate in Stevenage, whereas the German lived the life of luxury in Monaco. Although Hamilton later claimed the quote was taken out of context, Surtees feels it has only added fuel to the fire for Rosberg. 'Lewis had said he had more motivation than Nico to win the world championship because of his upbringing in a flat in Stevenage as against Nico growing up in Monaco,' added Surtees. 'If Nico wasn't already inspired to win his first world championship, then Lewis certainly would have provided some material for him to dig even deeper.' Frosty: Lewis Hamilton's attitude after Nico Rosberg's 'error' in qualifying reflected badly and didn't help him . Controversial: Rosberg was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in Saturday's qualifying session . Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff, meanwhile, has downplayed claims the rivalry between the pair is starting to resemble that of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. Three-times champion Senna and four-times king Prost were bitter enemies during the two seasons they spent together at McLaren in 1988 and 1989. On the team website, Wolff said: 'We have seen a lot of talk about their relationship, but that's not the key thing for a successful campaign. 'It's a job, not a holiday, and the drivers need to work with and for the team first of all. 'There have been a lot of comparisons to the Senna/Prost scenario, which is a kind of compliment to both Lewis and Nico. 'But the situation here is very different. It's an intense relationship but this intensity is normal. 'The racing philosophy of Mercedes-Benz is to allow our drivers to compete. We let the boys play with their toys, unless they break them.'","Hamilton refused to acknowledge team-mate Nico Rosberg on the podium .

"By . Ian Parker, Press Association . Click here to read our chief sports writer's debate column on Anelka's nasty strain of anti-Semitic Nazi posturing . Nicolas Anelka's hopes of pointing to the support of a prominent member of the French Jewish community in a bid to clear his name have received another blow. West Brom striker Anelka is facing a minimum five-match ban for his 'quenelle' salute, unless he can prove his case, after being charged by the Football Association with performing the allegedly anti-Semitic gesture after scoring against West Ham on December 28. The 34-year-old has until 6pm on Thursday to formally reply to the charge, which he appears certain to contest as he insists he is neither anti-Semitic nor racist. Bad move: Nicolas Anelka could bring a premature end to his career if he decides to challenge the FA . Anelka, however, believed he had the backing of a Jewish community leader in the battle to clear his name. Roger Cukierman, the president of CRIF (Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France), initially appeared to side with Anelka in an interview with Le Figaro. The quenelle has been described as an inverted Nazi salute and was created by French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, who has been prosecuted for anti-Semitism. Anelka is a friend of Dieudonne's, and the player has insisted his salute was a gesture aimed at the French establishment. Cukierman said in a video interview with Le Figaro the quenelle could not be regarded as anti-Semitic in the context it was performed in. Sparking controversy: Anelka celebrated with a quenelle gesture after he scored against West Ham . The French comedian at the heart of the storm surrounding Nicolas Anelka’s controversial ‘quenelle’ gesture has stated he is fully supportive of his “brother in humanity”. Dieudonne M’Bala M’Bala, who has been prosecuted for anti-Semitism, created the quenelle that has been described as an inverted Nazi salute.Speaking to Sky News, Dieudonne is firmly behind Anelka as he said: “Nicolas Anelka has all my support, that’s evident. “I consider him a brother in humanity. He’s someone who is very courageous and for whom I have much respect and admiration. “Anelka is a descendant of slaves and if he wants to remark on this history then he has the right to - and we are all very proud of him for doing so.” That prompted Anelka to write in a statement on his Facebook page: ""I therefore ask the English FA to kindly remove the charge made against me. And I repeat, I am not anti-Semitic or racist."" In the video, Cukierman said the gesture only had anti-Semitic connotations if made in front of a synagogue or a memorial to the Holocaust. But in a statement on the CRIF website, Cukierman has clarified his earlier views, and made clear Anelka's actions were disappointing. 'The 'quenelle' is a Nazi salute reversed, there's no doubt in my mind because this is the will of the one who created and popularised it for purely ideological ends,' said Cukierman. 'My statements in Le Figaro are no denial or renunciation on this subject, despite the interpretations that were made. 'However, I wished, perhaps too . quickly, to demonstrate that it was important to show discernment, . restraint, to avoid being drawn into a spiral that was difficult to . control. 'It is clear the gesture of the 'quenelle' has dangerously spread among our citizens and especially youth. Under fire: The Frenchman, ahead of West Brom's game against Everton on Monday (right), faces a lengthy ban . 'They . don't realise the severity and scope. They are doing this gesture for . provocation rather than anti-Semitism, at least I hope so. 'Should . we be hard on them? Definitely, as it glorifies crime against humanity, . but we must also teach the youth who are manipulated by Dieudonne and . his followers. 'It is up to teachers to do that, but also public figures from the worlds of culture and sport. 'This is why I was disappointed with the attitude of Anelka whose behaviour is the opposite of what a top athlete must show the youth of our country. 'I was troubled by the fact the public man he is - a symbol for some of the youth of our country and so must therefore be perfect in his behaviour - can make this gesture ""to show his friendship to his friend Dieudonne"", whose motivations are without a doubt anti-Semitic.' Defiant: A group perform the 'quenelle' gesture in France earlier this month . When West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in December's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football. But the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland. Here, we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala: .","Anelka was charged by the FA.

"By . Ian Parker, Press Association . Jenson Button has no intention of quitting Formula One just yet as he is determined to end his career on a high. Button is fast approaching a crossroads, however, as his contract with McLaren expires at the end of this season. At present the team are not competitive following a run of three successive races without scoring a point for the first time since 2009. Fitting: Button and girlfriend Jessica Michibata wear special commemorative pink t-shirts in memory of his father John, who died earlier this year . Crossroads: Jenson Button's contract with McLaren ends at the end of the season . However, with Honda due to return as their power unit supplier from 2015, there is naturally considerable excitement and optimism within McLaren. One of the great unknowns, though, is whether they will be quick out of the box, or whether it will take them at least a season or two to get up to speed. With Button now 34, he is quickly running out of opportunities to win a second world championship, so does he stay - if offered a new deal - or go? It is a tough dilemma for the Briton, but one certainty is he will not be calling time on F1 at the end of this season. 'I definitely want to be in F1. This sort of season does not make you want to retire,' said Button. 'If you do retire, you want to retire on a high and if you have the possibility to do that, then you continue racing to get that high. Target: Button wants McLaren to be true to their word and build competitive car . 'The problem then is when you do that you don't want to stop racing either, so you could be racing for many years. 'But no, I don't feel I want to retire at the end of this year. I am happy about my future, and think it is quite exciting.' Now in his fifth season with McLaren, Button would naturally love to remain with a team he knows have the resources to get him back to the front. But as he points out, there is one over-riding factor, adding: 'The biggest problem is I need to be in a car that is competitive, that gives you confidence as a driver as well. I hope that's here. 'It is a difficult decision for a driver in my position, with so much experience and so much to give . 'I'm at the point in my career where I've only a few years left where I will be in F1, and I want to be in a position where I can win races or be close to winning races. 'I would like to think I'll be here and the team will be competitive towards the end of this season, which will then give me good reason to want to be here.' Glory days: Jenson Button was World Champion in 2009, driving for Brawn . Button also appreciates there are few top seats available, with no driver movement likely unless someone is axed or decides to quit. It is why he feels it is imperative McLaren remain true to their word and they do turn their campaign around by building a fast car. 'We have to be quick towards the end of this year if we want to be quick next year because there are no regulation changes, so we have to stay focused,' said Button. 'We are not suddenly going to find two seconds over the winter. 'I know Ron (Dennis, McLaren Group CEO) has said he wants to win races this year, but that is going to be very, very difficult. 'I know why he is saying it because he understands we have to be quicker this year if we've a chance of being quick next year. 'That's why there is a big push, and we won't let up like perhaps Mercedes will once they have a 300-point lead!'","Jenson Button's contract with McLaren ends in the summer .

"Two-week-old  Elleah-Jayne Knight-Holmes won't have to worry about having female roles models to turn to as she grows up. The baby, from Kidderminster, represents the fifth generation of females in her family - and it's the second time they have celebrated five generations of girls. There are 89 years between   Elleah-Jayne and her great-great-grandmother Jean Hore. Female role models: From left, baby Elleah-Jayne, her mother, Katie Arens, 23, her aunty Amy Conway aged 27, her grandmother,  Laura Wycherley, 45, her great--grandmother Glenda Brown, 66, and great-great-grandmother Jean Hore, 89 . In 1987, Elleah-Jayne's aunt Amy Louise became the fifth generation of females when she was born. She was pictured at the time with her 100-year-old great-great grandmother Sarah Blything. But when Mrs Blything died in 1991, aged 104, the female contingent in the family was back down to four until Elleah-Jayne was born on July 8 this year to Katie Arens. And it was Katie's mother, Laura Wycherley, 45, who helped deliver her granddaughter after her 23-year-old daughter suddenly gave birth in the car as she rushed to hospital. Previous five generations: This picture from 1987 shows Jean when she was 62 (back right), with Glenda when she was aged 39, back left, Laura when aged 18, front right, holding Amy as a baby and Sarah Blything who was a 100-year-old great-great-grandmother here, left . The third generation started with great-grandmother Glenda Hore, 66, and then grandmother Laura. Laura's daughters Katie and Amy marked the fourth generation while her daughter Elleah-Jayne once more brings the family's female generations back up to five. New mother Katie, who has another two-year-old son Rylan, said: 'It was a spectacular way for our fifth generation female to arrive into this world. 'I went into labour and my partner Alex was driving me and my mum to hospital when I suddenly had the urge to push. 'We parked the car and dialled 999. We were all surprisingly calm and followed the phone instructions from the emergency services, but after my daughter was born I started to worry. 'However, once the two ambulances arrived, one for me and one for Elleah-Jayne, they were brilliant and both of us are fine. Plenty of babysitters: The family is full of 'strong women' who all live within five miles of one another . Fast arrival: Elleah-Jayne was born while her mother was still in the car going to the hospital .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . It is a fixture weighted in World Cup history; two finals, red cards, mass brawls, humiliations, penalty shootouts and more. Argentina versus Germany will climax the latest edition of football’s showcase tournament in Rio's Maracana Stadium on Sunday. It will be the third time they have met in the final – a record – having clashed in 1986 and 1990, and seventh time in total. Crowning moment: Diego Maradona lifts the trophy following Argentina's 3-2 victory over West Germany at Mexico 86 . There has been no shortage of incident, either. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at their previous World Cup encounters, starting with the two finals… . Italia 90 Final: West Germany 1 Argentina 0 . Let us deal with the minor details first; West Germany won 1-0 thanks to an Andreas Brehme penalty five minutes from time. For this final will forever be remembered for the savagery of the South Americans, and this from a team which included Diego Maradona. The captain, however, was complicate in the underhand tactics of his side, who were intent on spoiling their way through to penalty kicks. Protest: Maradona argues with the Mexican referee after Pedro Monzon was sent off . On top of the World: West Germany celebrate their victory in Rome . By the time Brehme’s winner arrived, Argentina were already down to 10 men, Pedro Monzon the first man in the history of the World Cup to be sent off in a final, a crude chop on Jurgen Klinsmann his crime. Gustavo Dezotti followed him for a second bookable offence three minutes from time and the Argentinean shame was complete. Mexico 86 Final: Argentina 3 West Germany 2 . Despite being contested in the searing midday heat of Mexico City, the two teams still found the fervour to share six bookings, which was a record until 2010. Happily, however, this final will be remembered for the five goals they also shared and the crowning of the marvellous Maradona as world champion. Argentina were 2-0 up thanks to Jose Luis Brown and Jorge Valdano with just 15 minutes remaining. Cool: Jorge Valdano puts Argentina 2-0 up amid the heat of the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City . Moment of glory: Jorge Burruchaga scores the winning goal past Harald Schumacher in the German goal . But the introduction of powerhouse frontman Dieter Hoeness - brother of Uli - had unsettled the South Americans and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Rudi Voller capitalised to draw Germany level. As Rummenigge later recalled, however, they were greedy and chased victory, affording Maradona a momentary yard to unpick their backline and spring Jorge Burruchaga clear and he did the rest with a cool finish six minutes from the end. South Africa 2010 Quarter-Final: Germany 4 Argentina 0 . File this one under ‘humiliation’, for Maradona’s Argentina were out-thought and out-fought by the young Germans - and the majority of the protagonists will again take to the stage in Rio on Sunday. Indeed, as many as 18 players involved in Cape Town are likely to feature in this weekend’s final. Head boy: Thomas Muller heads Germany into an early lead in Cape Town . Net gains: Miroslav Klose strikes late on to seal the 4-0 victory . Germany had already crushed England 4-1 in the last 16 but this was even more emphatic, especially given the favouritism of an Argentina side boasting a front three of Lionel Messi, Carlos Tevez and Gonzalo Higuain. It took just three minutes for Thomas Muller to head the opener and, while Argentina did threaten parity early in the second half, Germany put the tie to rest with two goals in six minutes courtesy of Miroslav Klose and Arne Friedrich. Klose volleyed a fourth late on to compound Maradona’s misery. Germany 2006 Quarter-Final: Germany 1 Argentina 1 (Germany won 4-2 on penalties) Memory of this meeting exists outside the confine of 120 minutes – in which Klose had equalised Roberto Ayala’s headed opener - and for a penalty shootout and subsequent brawl which was, predictably, coined the Battle of Berlin. Spot-kick misses from Ayala and Esteban . Cambiasso were punished by four successful German efforts but an . ill-tempered melee ensued in which Argentina substitute Leandro Cufre . was sent off. Spot of bother: Jens Lehmann saves Roberto Ayala's penalty to send Germany into the last four . Relief: Germany celebrate their victory on home soil . Battle of Berlin: But a mass brawl broke out following the shootout . England 1966 Group Stage: West Germany 0 Argentina 0 . Having both enjoyed victory in their opening group matches, it was a case of damage limitation at Villa Park as the pair settled for the point which kept them at the top of the table. Both, of course, were ultimately beaten by England, Argentina at the quarter-final stage and West Germany in the final. Sweden 1958: West Germany 3 Argentina 1 . Holders West Germany opened their defence with a comfortable victory in Malmo. Despite falling behind in the third minute to an Omar Corbatta strike, the champions were ahead by half-time thanks to goals from Helmut Rahn and Uwe Seeler and the former added another after the break. The match was remembered for Argentina wearing the shirts of host city IFK Malmo after forgetting to bring their change strip.

"By . Emily Crane . The sister of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been painted in a naked embrace with her same-sex partner in a portrait for this year's Archibald Prize. Christine Forster is pictured hugging her partner of six years, Virginia Edwards, in a painting created by Sydney artist Robyn Ross. The couple, who have been engaged for nine months despite Mr Abbott's staunch view against same-sex marriage in Australia, was approached by Ms Ross with the portrait idea last year. Christine Forster (right) is pictured hugging her partner of six years, Virginia Edwards, (left) in a painting created by Sydney artist Robyn Ross for this year's Archibald Prize . Ms Forster and Ms Edwards collaborated with the artist and approved of the naked embrace depiction to highlight the marriage equality debate. 'We don't have any problems with it being portrayed in that open and honest way – that's what our relationship is about,' Ms Forster told MailOnline. 'It's very confronting to see paintings like that of yourself. You're looking at something that is captured from someone else's eyes. '(It) blew us away and that's pretty amazing.' The couple, who have been engaged for nine months despite Mr Abbott's staunch view against same-sex marriage in Australia, was approached by Ms Ross with the portrait idea last year . Ms Forster, a liberal City of Sydney councillor, said she could imagine her Prime Minister brother reacting in the same way. Ms Ross said the couple did not pose nude in front of her, instead they wore sarongs as she sketched and photographed them in her studio . 'I think he will think it's a great artwork. Tony and I and Virginia and Margie (Mr Abbot's wife) are close. We're a family. We love each other,' she said. 'He will probably have the same response I had and that's “what an incredible piece”.' Ms Ross said the couple did not pose nude in front of her, instead they wore sarongs as she sketched and photographed them in her studio. 'The whole idea was to have no jewellery or clothing, just them. But it's not a focus on them being naked – it shows two people in love in a pure and honest way,' Ms Ross said. 'It's an intimate insight into two people in love. It doesn't matter if they're the same sex. They should be given the same right to get married.' The Archibald entry, titled Ladies In Waiting, took Ms Ross about 75 hours to paint and stands at 1.5 square metres. 'I sketched them, took photos and discussed with them how to put it together,' Ms Ross said. 'We all decided on the concept that was going to send a strong message.' Ms Forster and Ms Edwards collaborated with the artist and approved of the naked embrace depiction to highlight the marriage equality debate . The couple were also painted by another Sydney artist, Perry Westwood, with that painting touching on the time Ms Forster and Ms Edwards came out publicly with their relationship. 'I really think that two artists approaching us to paint us is a really strong indication of just how much marriage equality as an issue has been accepted by ordinary Australians,' Ms Forster said. 'It just reflects how much marriage equality and gay and lesbian issues are just part of the mainstream. It’s nothing unusual, it’s just a no brainer.' Ms Forster's brother, Prime Minister Tony Abbott, is against same-sex marriage and has previously said the 'government supports the current definition of marriage contained in the Marriage Act 1961'","Christine Forster was painted hugging long-term partner Virginia Edwards .

"By . James Tozer . Rachel Lyne, who was a victim of a harassment campaign by Richard and Amanda Holman, who claimed she was a prostitute . Rachel Lyne will forever regret her short-lived affair with the plumber who fixed her boiler. She ended the relationship with Richard Holman after four weeks when she discovered he was married – but her troubles were only just beginning. For seven years, the 48-year-old suffered the effects of a smear campaign masterminded by Holman and his furious wife. The couple, who lived in a £1million farmhouse in Scorton, Lancashire, set up hundreds of fake online profiles branding her a prostitute and a benefits cheat. She moved hundreds of miles away to escape the slurs, but faced a steady stream of men at her door expecting sex. Eventually, police gave her a panic alarm and she resorted to putting a note outside her home stating it was not a brothel. Yesterday 45-year-old Holman and his then wife Amanda – now divorced – were starting 26-week jail terms after being convicted of harassment. But many of the cruel profiles remain accessible. After the hearing, Miss Lyne said the couple had ‘destroyed every little aspect of my life’, adding: ‘It’s gone on for seven years … It destroyed my relationship with my parents. ‘Friends and people I had known all my life were looking at me sideways. You can imagine the humiliation and embarrassment that it has brought to my family.’ Richard Holman, left, and Amanda Holman, right, who have both been jailed for 26 weeks after being found guilty of harassment . Miss Lyne started a relationship with . Holman after he fixed her boiler in 2007. She found out he was married . when his wife answered his mobile phone, and immediately ended the . affair. Mrs Holman – a . director of her husband’s gas fires firm – called her a ‘home-wrecker’ and a ‘whore’. Shortly after the romance was discovered, parcels of . lingerie began arriving at Miss Lyne’s home and workplace. Her . parents and neighbours received letters alleging she was a prostitute, . drug dealer and benefits cheat. Her dog went missing and was found 400 . miles away. Hundreds of fake . online dating and sex profiles were set up in her name, with up to four . men a day appearing at her home expecting sexual services.

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Lewis Hamilton took one final, forlorn look at the smouldering Mercedes behind him and held his head in his hands, his hopes of  victory at Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix — and who knows what else — ravaged by a fireball. It was during his first fast lap of qualifying that orange flames came pouring out of the back of his car. ‘Guys. I’m on fire,’ he radioed to his Mercedes engineers. ‘OK Lewis just stop the car where there is a fire marshal,’ was their instruction only for the Briton to inform them: ‘I can’t stop it!’ Extinguish: Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton pulls out of qualfying at the Hungarian Grand Prix . Inferno: Hamilton's Mercedes caught fire as he was driving around the Hungaroring in Q1 . Rush: Hamilton managed to drive around the track and make it to the pit lane before he jumped out of the car . Cloud: Smoke billowed out of the engine as a fuel leak caused Hamilton's Mercedes to catch fire . State: Hamilton's Mercedes was badly damaged by the fire as it spread around the rear end of the car . Sullen: Hamilton cuts a frustrated figure as he walks away from his smoking car . Pacesetter: Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg qualified on pole at the Hungaroring . 1. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes)2. Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull)3. Valtteri Bottas (Williams)4. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull)5. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari)6. Felipe Massa (Williams)7. Jenson Button (McLaren)8. Jean-Eric Vergne (Toro Rosso)9. Nico Hulkenberg (Force India)10. Kevin Magnuessn (McLaren) 21. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) Marshals sprayed their fire extinguishers at the blaze, yet smoke continued to leak out for several minutes longer. The fire meant he did not record a time and he will start from the pit lane — a disappointment compounded by his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg taking a pole position as comfortably as any of his six this season. It was impossible to feel anything but sympathy for Hamilton, who is enduring a horrible run of bad luck. Four times mechanical problems have hindered him in the first 11 rounds of the championship. Rosberg, his only rival for the title, has suffered two glitches (one of which, in Canada, he managed  successfully whereas Hamilton retired with the same over-heating brake complaint). ‘There’s a lot going through my mind, but I just have to try to turn it into positives,’ said Hamilton, who trails his team-mate by 14 points. Looking on: Hamilton stares at his smoking Mercedes as engineers try and extinguish the fire . Flames: Hamilton drives around a corner of the Hungaroring with his engine on fire during Q1 . Frustration: Hamilton has now gone six race without a pole position after his withdrawal in Q1 . Before going he provided  a few considered thoughts on the incident. ‘I bailed out of that timed lap and something happened to my brakes so I had to engage some settings to correct it and then the engine just died,’ he said. ‘I was on the pit-lane entry so hoped I could get it back to the pits and they could fix it, but I looked in my rear mirrors and it was on fire. ‘I hoped to get it to the garage. Maybe they could have done something but I tried to stop and the brakes weren’t working. It is all pretty bad. I honestly don’t know what I can do tomorrow. I will struggle to get in the top five or 10. ‘I’ll probably leave here more than 20 points behind Nico but there are still races to go. I will try my best.’ Contrasting fortunes: Rosberg races past Hamilton with the Briton's Mercedes on fire in the pit lane . Centre of attention: Rosberg claimed his third consecutive pole ahead of Sebastian Vettel and Valtteri Bottas . Last week he produced a dazzling remedial drive from 20th on the grid to finish third at Hockenheim. But this twisty track presents so few overtaking chances that he will have to drive even more outstandingly to find a way to the podium. So if Rosberg has no problems, he is clear favourite to win. Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel, who was second yesterday, and Williams’ Valtteri Bottas, who was third quickest, are surely left to fight it out with the best of the rest. Rosberg earned his pole by dealing with the tricky rain that had just started to fall at the first corner during the final shootout for pole. He ran wide, but had cut his speed sufficiently to steer himself back on to the track. Kevin Magnussen, following behind, was less adroit, thudding his McLaren into the tyre wall to condemn him to start from the pit lane. The Dane’s team-mate Jenson Button was seventh fastest, seven places higher than he started the race in 2006 — his first victory. It rained that afternoon, mixing up the usual order. Rain is again forecast for Sunday. Kimi Raikkonen endured another awful afternoon. He was pipped by his possible Ferrari replacement, Marussia’s Jules Bianchi, after his team embarrassingly told him to sit in the garage rather than put in another lap. By that point, Hamilton was already out of his car, on the way to a blue Mercedes 4x4 and back to the hotel. As he walked out he fiddled with the rosary beads hanging around his neck. Helpless: Hamilton can only lean over his Mercedes as he watches race stewards attempt to put out the fire . Facing away: Hamilton looks into the distance as his Mercedes continues to billow smoke in the background . Smash: Kevin Magnussen's McLaren is put on the back of a tow truck following his big crash in qualifying .

"By . Andrew Levy . Most new graduates lack even the basic skills needed for the workplace, complain major employers. More than two-thirds of bosses said they cannot handle customers while half said they cannot operate independently. Half of companies said university leavers struggle with basic English and nearly two-fifths claim they  cannot do simple maths. 'Superfluous: The Business Secretary pointed out professions where degrees do not seem to be of use . Many firms said jobseekers expected to ‘get rich quick’ after being ‘damaged’ by the instant fame culture created by reality TV and  talent shows. Employers also complained that graduates were more interested in ‘what a job can do for them, not what they have to offer an employer’. Deloitte, HSBC, BT and Tesco, as well as the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, were among 127 employers surveyed. More than half were having difficulty filling vacancies and most will spend more on training to bring recruits up to standard. But the research commissioned by BPP, which trains professionals, added that 91 per cent of firms were happy with applicants’ IT skills. John Cridland, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said schools had become ‘conveyor belts’ with too little emphasis on wider skills and attitudes. Lacking: The survey of 127 employers, included companies such as Tesco, and it found that many graduates lack basic skills . He said: ‘Rigorous standards are vital but there’s been too little emphasis on the wider skills and attitudes that employers demand. ‘Instead of trying to push students over the grade C line at GCSE, we need a system which prizes rounded and grounded young people.’ And Dr Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said broadening the workforce’s skills was a ‘priority’. ‘Businesses tell us they lack confidence in our education system’s ability to deliver basic literacy and numeracy skills,’ he added. ‘But employers also want to see young people with a strong worth ethic, and “softer” skills like timekeeping, and communication, which are fundamental in the work environment. ‘It’s essential that when young people leave the education system they have at least the basic skills that employers need.’ BPP chief executive Carl Lygo said the poll showed employers were looking for reliable staff who could immediately make a contribution to their business. ‘It seems that graduates and apprentices are keen and IT literate but that’s not enough. They need to be ready for the real world of work,’ he said.… .","Survey of 127 bosses including BT, Tesco and Department for Busines .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . The woman hired to clean up Rutgers' scandal-scarred athletic program quit her job at Tennessee 16 years ago over accusations that she put her volleyball team through a storm of humiliation and fear, a scathing report has claimed. Julie Hermann, who was hired as Rutgers' athletic director on May 15, was reportedly the subject of a letter from former players who said she ruled through humiliation, fear and emotional abuse. 'The mental cruelty that we as a team . have suffered is unbearable,' the players said about Hermann, . Rutgers' new athletic director who had served as the No. 2 . athletic administrator at Louisville. Under the microscope: Julie Hermann, Rutgers' new athletic director, says she doesn't remember the letter that accused her of taking jabs at her former volleyball players' weight, and calling them whores and learning disabled . The Star-Ledger reported Saturday night on its website yesterday that all 15 of the Tennessee team members said Hermann called them 'whores, alcoholics and learning disabled.' They wrote: 'It has been unanimously decided that this is an irreconcilable issue.' The players told The Star-Ledger that Hermann absorbed the words and said: 'I choose not to coach you guys.' The 49-year-old Hermann, set to take over the Rutgers' program June 17, told The Star-Ledger she didn't remember the letter. The newspaper said that when it was read to her by phone Wednesday, she replied, 'Wow.' Hermann, the first woman to head Rutgers' athletic program and one of three female ADs at the 124 schools that make up college football's top tier, has promised a restart for the program following the ouster of its men's basketball coach and the resignation of other officials. She is set to replace Tim Pernetti, who quit last month after the firing of basketball coach Mike Rice. Axed: Former Rutgers coach Mike Rice was fired on April 3 after a video emerged of him shoving players and berating them with insults and gay slurs . Angry: The video, which was screened by ESPN, showed several moments when Mr Rice angrily pushed, shoved and grabbed his players during practices . Admission: Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice, has admitted that his decision to suspend Rice in December - and not fire him - was the wrong move . The video showed numerous clips of Rice firing basketballs at players, hitting them in the back, legs, feet and shoulders. It also showed him grabbing players by their jerseys and yanking them around the court. Rice can also be heard yelling obscenities and using anti-gay slurs. The controversy went public in April when ESPN aired the videos and Rutgers President Robert Barchi admitted he didn't view the video in the fall. Rice was fired and Pernetti, assistant . coach Jimmy Martelli and interim senior vice president and university . counsel John Wolf resigned. Whistleblower: The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012 . Anger: In this clip, Mr Rice, in white, is seen gesturing aggressively towards one of the Rutgers players . Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!' After a series of interviews with many of the former Tennessee players about Hermann, The Star-Ledger said: 'Their accounts depict a coach who thought nothing of demeaning them, who would ridicule and laugh at them over their weight and their performances, sometimes forcing players to do 100 sideline pushups during games, who punished them after losses by making them wear their workout clothes inside out in public or not allowing them to shower or eat, and who pitted them against one another, cutting down particular players with the whole team watching, and through gossip. 'Several women said playing for Hermann had driven them into depression and counseling, and that her conduct had sullied the experience of playing Division I volleyball.' The Star-Ledger asked Hermann about the players' lingering grievances. 'I never heard any of this, never name-calling them or anything like that whatsoever,' she told the newspaper. 'None of this is familiar to me.' Rutgers will join the Big Ten in 2014. The new boss: Hermann, the first woman to head Rutgers' athletic department, has promised a restart for the program . When push comes to shove: Pernetti insisted yesterday that he issued an 'appropriate' suspension after he was shown the tape and conducted an investigation into the matter .","Julie Hermann, who was hired earlier this month, is accused of berating Tennessee volleyball players about their weight and calling them 'whores'

"By . Sam Webb . The former editor of two of Australia's top magazines has told a court she was so high on drugs she did not notice her friend was stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from her. Nene King, who helmed Woman's Day and Australian Women's Weekly magazines, only find out she was being stolen from when she noticed a card transaction for a meal at fast food outlet she never ate at, Melbourne Magistrates Court heard. Ms King was, 69, giving evidence in the case of her former friend, Colin Hahne, who has been charged with stealing more than $223,000 from her between December 2008 and September 2009. Nene King, pictured being interviewed on Australian television, claims a former friend stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps as much as half a million, from her through fraud . Hahne, 43, faces a total of 42 charges involving theft, dishonesty and forgery offences. Ms King told the court of her addiction to cannabis at the time, claiming she was smoking up to 10 joints a day and spending up to $600 a month on the drug. She was also taking Prozac and was battling depression after the death of her third husband, Patrick Bowring, in a diving accident in 1996. 'It was a very difficult time,' she told the court. 'I must be honest, I was not well.' The Age reported that Hahne and another man lived with Ms King while the alleged offences took place. She discovered the losses after going through her bank statements and believes the thefts totalled more than half a million Australian dollar, financially crippling her. She said transactions relating to a private health insurer, a telecommunications company, Lotto purchases, apartments and the fast food outlet were examples of alleged fraudulent activity. Visionary: Miss King was seen as a publishing revolutionary who pushed magazine sales to a record level in the 1980s . Ms King, under cross examination by defence lawyer Sarah Leighfield, said she had bought Hahne and the other man a trip to Paris and Monte Carlo as a thank you for looking after her house and pets while she was in hospital. She claimed to be on a holiday in America in May 2009 when her credit cards both bounced because she owed $44,000 on her American Express card and $32,000 on her Westpac Visa card. She said: 'I thought I still had a lot of money in those days,' she said. 'I worked hard for a very long time and earned a lot of money.' She added that when she met her lawyer to discuss the alleged thefts she was 'demented' and could have made mistakes when identifying on bank statements other, smaller examples of alleged fraud. King was dubbed 'the queen of cash and trash' because she paid vast sums of money for paparazzi photographs of celebrities during the 1980s and 1990s. She first noticed the fraud after her credit cards were rejected in the U.S., even though she believed she had lots of money left from her glittering career . Under her stewardship Woman's Day she boosted its circulation to an Australian magazine sales record of 1.4million. She later became the first woman board member of Kerry Packer's Australian Consolidated Press empire. A two-part ABC series called Paper Giants: Magazine War will depict her life. The preliminary hearing continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nene King, who revolutionised Australian publishing, was in court today .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . and Luke Salkeld . It is usually the incoming tide that spells the end for sandcastles. But this 13ft-high fortress, built to mark the 100-day countdown to the Olympics, did not even stand long enough to have the waves lapping at its walls. Instead, after £5,000 was spent on building the castle over four painstaking days, it was knocked down – over health and safety fears. No sooner were the requisite publicity photos taken than a mechanical digger demolished it. Joy: Children wave Union Flags on top of the giant sandcastle, which had been built on Weymouth beach in Dorset to mark 100 days until the London Olympics at a cost of £5,000 . Organisers claimed keeping the castle on the beach in Weymouth, Dorset, which will host Olympic sailing events, would have meant hiring 24-hour security staff in case it toppled over and trapped a child or people climbed on it. But locals described the castle, built by sand sculptor Mark Anderson and funded by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic  Games (Locog), as a waste of time and money. One likened last Friday’s demolition to a plotline from Twenty Twelve, the BBC’s satire on the preparations for the Olympics, while another said: ‘What a  waste of money – £5,000 for a sandcastle that didn’t stay around for people to see. Despair: The fort was knocked down almost as soon as it had been completed over fears it could topple onto someone, much to the anger of local residents and businesses, who branded it a waste of time and money . ‘If it was dangerous then why build it in the first place?’ A Locog spokesman said the decision . to destroy the sandcastle was made jointly by Locog, the local council . and Mr Anderson, explaining: ‘The sandcastle was dismantled as a safety . precaution straight after the photos were taken. 'Over-reaction': Businesses, in particular, are ruing a missed opportunity to attract tourists to the area off the back of the giant structure . Farce: The circumstances surrounding the sandcastle could have come straight out of a storyline for Twenty Twelve (above), the BBC satirical comedy about incompetent Olympic organisers . The official motto for the London Olympics will be 'Inspire a Generation!', organisers announced today. With the Games just 100 days away, the slogan was officially unveiled at a ceremony at Kew Gardens by London organising committee (LOCOG) chairman Lord Coe and chief executive Paul Deighton. But having had nearly seven years to think of one, some may question whether it is the best they could have come up with. Speaking at Kew today, Lord Coe (pictured above) said: 'I am delighted to announce the motto Inspire a Generation. 'It is everything we have been saying since we have started this extraordinary journey, not just since we got across the finish line in Singapore. 'It is the heartbeat, the very DNA of this organisation and a rallying cry for the athletes to come to the UK to perform at their very best and inspire the world. 'With 100 days to go to the start of the Games, millions of people are getting ready to do the best work of their lives and welcome the world this summer. Expectations are high and we won't disappoint.' ‘Our aim was to create an iconic photo opportunity for Weymouth and Portland.’ The spokesman added: ‘Already we have . seen this photograph used by people [and] publications worldwide and it . has undoubtedly been a successful exercise.’ Mr Anderson completed the impressive project last Friday morning, a few hours before photographers turned up to take pictures. Within . minutes of them leaving, a mechanical digger arrived on the beach at . Weymouth - which will host all the Olympic sailing events - and promptly . demolished the castle in an hour. Simon Williams, head of the Weymouth and . Portland 2012 operations team for Weymouth and Portland Borough Council, . justified its removal. He said: 'It was an organisational decision. 'We . took it down because it was constructed in a special way and we . couldn’t have just left it there in case it fell on a young child. We . would have been criticised if that had been the case.' A council spokesman added: 'It was built to create a photo opportunity to mark 100 days to go to the Olympics. 'To keep it there until the start of the Olympics would have required additional security and presented a health and safety risk in that it was quite a big structure and it could have collapsed with a child playing on the beach near to it. 'It could have been cordoned off but that would have required additional security to make sure there was no risk of people climbing on it.' Sand artist Mr Anderson said: 'Demolishing it was all part of the plan because there would have been health and safety issues. 'People could have injured themselves on the council’s land so there would be no way we could leave something like that.' The castle was paid for by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), which is privately funded. Locals today slammed the decision to demolish the castle. One resident said: 'If it was dangerous then why build it in the first place?' Countdown begins: Olympic officials and the media admire a large set of Olympic Rings, created with at least 20,000 flowers and plants in Kew Gardens today to also mark the 100-day milestone . Craig Willis, owner of the Wilton . Guest House, 'It reminds me a bit like the programme Twenty Twelve, . except this hasn’t been made up. 'It was a great piece of work and we all went to see it during its short life. It’s a shame that it has gone. 'It sounds like health and safety has gone a bit over the top but I suppose they have their reasons for demolishing it.' Georgie . Rushforth, of the the Lodmoor Premier Inn, said: 'I thought the . sandcastle was a good idea, I don’t really understand why it was . demolished. 'It’s a bit over-dramatic and I think health and safety has gone overboard.' Just as the Weymouth sandcastle was being cleared away, construction of Europe's longest artificial beach was starting to take shape in London. Greenwich Beach will open near the Olympic venue next month, with an Olympic-size volleyball court and plans for a restaurant and live events stage catering for crowds of up to 5,000. The site is expected to be used during the Peninsula Festival and for events during the 2012 Olympic Games. Could this be the missing sandcastle?

'Value for money': Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt (above) has defended accusations that the Olympics have cost the taxpayer too much . Olympic leaders have defended the public expenditure on London 2012 after 64 per cent of poll respondents said taxpayers had paid too much towards the Games. Jeremy Hunt, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, pointed out that a majority in the BBC poll - 55 per cent - also rated London 2012 as good value for money. London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe added the Olympics have provided jobs and investment at a critical time in the economy. With 100 days to go to the start of the Games, Mr Hunt said: 'The same poll said more than half of the respondents said the Olympics would be good value for money. 'If you ask people if they spent too much on their Christmas shopping just after they have done the big shop just before Christmas Day a lot of people would say yes. 'The right time to ask people if it has been worth it is after we have had the event.' Lord Coe said he was not surprised by the poll results, but the Games had already paid an economic dividend with between £6billion and £7billion going into the British construction industry and 42,000 people having worked directly or indirectly on the Olympic Park. He added: 'Jobs have been safeguarded throughout the UK particularly in some very challenged communities . 'I’m not particularly surprised (at the poll), it’s understandable given the world we live in - domestically and internationally people are focused on value for money. 'But in the lead-up to the Games and in the long haul of the legacy of the Games I’m confident we will be able to demonstrate far and away that this was a project that - I’m still gratified that well over half the population believe it - this is value for money and there are tangible benefits in their communities.'",Officials feared sculpture on Weymouth beach might topple onto someone .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 11:24 EST, 21 February 2012 . Elizabeth Smart, who was kidnapped at the age of 14 from her bedroom at knife-point and held captive for nine months, was married in Hawaii on Saturday. The ceremony had been due to take place in the summer, but due to media attention Ms Smart, 24, and her fiancé Matthew Gilmour decided on the 'spur of the moment' to bring the wedding forward, according to the bride's father. 'It's everything you can imagine with planning a wedding, only it's compressed into a few days,' Elizabeth said of her decision to push the date forward several months. The couple, who are both Mormons, married at the LDS Laie Hawaii Temple, but plan to settle in Salt Lake City, Utah. Wedded bliss: Ms Smart with her new husband Matthew Gilmour, whom she married in February 2012 . Happy: Miss Smart, pictured with her Mr Gilmour, has said she is 'excited for this next chapter in her life' Couple: Miss Smart and Mr Gilmour brought their wedding forward from the summer . 'Elizabeth's desire was for what most . women want — to celebrate her nuptials in a private wedding with family . and close friends,' said family spokesman Chris Thomas. 'After . the story broke about her engagement and the media became increasingly . invasive, Elizabeth recognized it was going to be impossible to have a . traditional wedding devoid of distractions and unusual challenges . outside of her control. 'She is positively radiant, and Matthew couldn't be happier.' 'She decided, about a week ago, the best way to avoid significant distraction was to change her wedding plans and to get married in an unscheduled ceremony outside of Utah.' Ms Smart's father Ed, who described the wedding as 'kind of a spur of the moment thing', said: 'We're just thrilled she's married.' The couple will now take an extended honeymoon in a secret location. Because of the shortened planning time, the bride-to-be had to overlook some traditional wedding inclusions, like the collection of something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. 'Are you kidding?' she told People magazine. 'There's been no time!' Venue: The couple married at the Laie Hawaii Temple, the first Mormon temple outside the U.S. mainland . Secret: The Hawaii wedding was planned just a week in advance thanks to intense media attention . Hitched: Miss Smart was married in a secret ceremony in a Mormon temple in Hawaii . The . pretty blonde hit headlines after she disappeared from her . bedroom in 2002. Despite a nationwide search for the teen, she was not . found for nine months. It . was only when an alert biker who had heard about her case on America's . Most Wanted spotted her at a diner about 18 miles from her home. In . the nine months she was held captive by one-time itinerant street . preacher Brian David Mitchell and his wife Wanda Barzee, she was . continuously raped and was even married to Mitchell in a bizarre . ceremony. He was convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault and was sentenced to serve life in prison in May 2011. Wanda Barzee was sentenced to 15 years in a Texas federal prison hospital for her role in the kidnapping of the girl. It was revealed last month that Ms Smart had become engaged to 22-year-old Mr Gilmour, from Aberdeen in Scotland. The pair met last year when they were both serving as Mormon missionaries in the south of France. Bravery: Elizabeth Smart, now 24, spoke out for the first time in December to the Salt Lake City Rotary Club about the horrific details of her abduction ten years ago . Never forgotten: Miss Smart, now a 24-year-old university student, wiped tears from her eyes as she recounted the details of how Mitchell 'married' then raped her . In December she spoke for the first . time publicly about what she suffered at the hands of Mitchell, . revealing horrific details about her ordeal, including how he dragged . her from her bedroom to a camp in the woods where he performed the . marriage and then raped her. She said: 'He went straight from marrying me to . raping me. And after that moment I couldn't feel more worthless and more . degraded. It was the worse feeling I could have ever felt.' 'I kept begging him to let me go - and he wouldn't listen to me,' she told ABC. 'All I could do was scream ''No"". He said, ''If you ever scream like that again, I will kill you.' Ordeal: Elizabeth Smart was abducted at knifepoint from her Salt Lake City home on June 5, 2002. She was held captive for nine months . Guilty: Brian David Mitchell was sentenced to life in prison for kidnapping and raping Elizabeth Smart after she was found alive on March 3, 2003 . Accomplice: Wanda Barzee was charged with the  kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart and sentenced to 15 years in jail . Although Miss Smart has published a . book on her terrifying ordeal and spoken at the trial of Mitchell last . year, this was the first time she was heard in public recounting the . terrible details. She had been invited to speak to members of the Salt Lake City Rotary Club to help promote her charity the Elizabeth Smart Foundation. It works in schools across the country with a programme radKIDS to educate children on how to protect themselves from danger. The senior at Brigham Young University recalled being tied down with a cable on her first night and the deep sense of hopelessness that surrounded her. She was held captive for nine months during which time she was raped daily by Mitchell, sometimes up to three or four times a day. Miss Smart had testified at Mitchell's trial in 2010 in excruciating detail about waking up in the early hours of June 5, 2002, to the feel of a cold, jagged knife at her throat and being whisked away by the religious fanatic. Going home: Elizabeth Smart with her mother Lois and police officers after being found close to her home nine months after she was abducted . Safe place: Police dogs search the grounds of the Smart family home after their 14-year-old daughter was snatched in the middle of the night . Within hours of the kidnapping, she . testified, she was stripped of her favourite red pajamas, draped in . white, religious robes and forced into a polygamous marriage with . Mitchell. She was tethered to a metal cable . strung between two trees and subjected to near-daily rapes while being . forced to use alcohol and drugs. She described the horrific events as her 'nine months of hell.' She recalled being forced to live . homeless, dress in disguises and stay quiet or lie about her identity if . ever approached by strangers or police. Daily, her life and those of her family members were threatened by Mitchell, she said at the trial.

'She also really loves the attention she gets after a photo has been taken so it’s easy for me to capture her shenanigans. 'Clothes don’t seem to bother her one bit, she’s always had clothes, because not long after I adopted Ginny she had a severe skin allergy and eczema, so she lost a lot of her fur and while we waited for it to grow back and for the medication to help her, she wore coats and jumpers so she didn’t get cold.

'The community on Instagram is amazing, Ginny regularly receives lovely letters, drawings, accessories, treats and was once even given a skateboard.

"By . Damien Gayle . An Aleppo woman has described the moment she saw Syrian rebels murder her 14-year-old son for cracking a joke about the Prophet Mohammed. Mohammed Katta was shot dead in broad daylight by Islamist fighters in the city which has been at the heart of the insurrection against the regime of President Bashar Assad. Nadia Umm Faud, Mohammed's mother, was just yards away when her son, a drummer boy in the revolution's early protest marches, was shot three times and left for dead. Murdered for a 'joke': Mohammad Katta, 14, right, who was shot dead by rebels in Aleppo . Her testimony comes as the U.S. sought to persuade Western and Arab allies to commit to directing all aid to Syrian rebels through the Western-backed Supreme Military Council to try to reduce the power of jihadi groups. She told the Daily Telegraph how she was at home in Aleppo's Shaar district when the rebel fighters, who she believes were foreigners, drove her badly beaten son back to his home neighbourhood. Hearing the warning shouts of neighbours she ran to the apartment's balcony where she saw group arrive. 'I said to his father, ""They are going to shoot your son! Come! Come! Come!"" I was on the stairs when I heard the first shot,'she recalled. Shot: Mohammed's mother told how she saw her son being shot. He was fired at three times by activists . An image grab taken from Syria's official television channel al-Ikhbariya reportedly shows the body of 14-year old Mohammad after he was shot dead . 'I was at the door when I hear the second shot. 'I saw the third shot.' The killers ignored her screams, merely giving her a dirty look as they climbed into their car, she said. 'As they went, they drove over my son's arm, as he lay there dying.' A city overcome with savagery: A rebel-held area in Aleppo, where a 14-year-old boy was shot dead by Islamists fighters for cracking a joke which mentioned the Prophet Mohammed . A Syrian rebel fighter wearing the jihadi headgear carries a machine gun: Many foreign fighters, drawn to the opportunity to fight for their faith, are now based in the city, where they have formed their own brigades . Mohammed had been working at the family's coffee stall in Aleppo's Shaar district when he made the quip that sealed his fate. Asked by a customer to hand over a coffee in return for later payment, he shouted: 'I wouldn't give the Prophet Mohammed credit if he came here today.' Two men who overheard his comment marched over and dragged him off in a car, ignoring his protestations of piety and even the objections of a militiaman from the Free Syrian Army. When they returned, half-an-hour later, Mohammed had been beaten. He was staggering and fell to his knees when they pulled him from the car and a bag had been placed over his head. Mohammed was not heard to say anything from the moment he was taken away, to the moment he was shot dead. His father Abdulwahab Katta said: 'I saw my son, and saw him dead, and saw a fountain of blood coming out of him. 'I, too, said nothing. I was mute.' Run!

Even Jabhat al-Nusra, the local . affiliate of Al Qaeda, has issued a statement condemning the killing and . denying responsibility. But their status as war's most militant . Islamist group has now been eclipsed. Clashes between rebels and the Syrian Army continued today in and around the northern city of Aleppo, where government forces announced an offensive earlier this month. Activists said troops clashed in the southern neighbourhoods of Rashideen and Hamdaniya and in the western suburbs. The Coventry-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels pounded a military academy in the area, causing a fire in the compound. There were no immediate reports of casualties. In Rashideen, rebel forces have pushed government forces out from parts of the neighbourhood, according to the local Aleppo Media Centre network and posts on Facebook. A statement by a coalition of rebel groups, posted on the Centre's page, declared that the fighters are launching a new operation to seize control of the western neighborhoods of Aleppo. Amateur showed what appeared to be intense government shelling of villages in the area. Many foreign fighters, drawn to the . opportunity to fight for their faith, are now based in the city, where . they have formed their own brigades, which are often better armed and better paid than those of local fighters.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman who admitted tweeting the identity of the accuser the trial of Coronation Street's Michael Le Vell has been fined . A woman who admitted tweeting the identity of the accuser the trial of Coronation Street's Michael Le Vell has been fined. Deborah Armstrong, 37, wrote on her Twitter account: 'I hope Michael Le Vell's victim...now goes public' - and identified the person involved. When other users tried to tell her that the tweet was breaking the law she told others: 'You are not my judge and jury.' Under law, all alleged sex offence victims are granted anonymity for life - even if the defendant in the case is later cleared. Armstrong, of Bedale, North Yorkshire, was fined £110 after pleading guilty to an offence under the Sexual Offences Amendment Act on September 10 last year, of publishing information that could lead to members of the public identifying a complainant in a sexual offences case. Fran Gough, prosecuting, told Manchester Magistrates' Court that the law gives lifelong anonymity to anyone if they are the complainant in a sex offence case and nothing must be published that can identify them. Ms Gough said the trial of Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell for sex offences attracted widespread media interest. Mr Le Vell was acquitted of all charges. But at the end of the trial Armstrong, using her Twitter account of @DebbieJ1976, tweeted the identity of the complainant in the case because, Miss Gough said, 'she was angry at the perceived injustice of the acquittal'. Miss Gough said there was a strong public interest in protecting the anonymity of people who make complaints of sex offences against them - otherwise they may not come forward. Police tracked Armstrong down and she was arrested a month later. Armstrong, who had no previous convictions and is understood to be the full-time carer for her mother, admitted to officers she did not immediately delete the tweet but later took the tweet down and closed her account. Fran Gough, prosecuting, told Manchester Magistrates' Court that the law gives lifelong anonymity to anyone if they are the complainant in a sex offence case and nothing must be published that can identify them . Passing sentence, District Judge Khalid Qureshi said: 'It's not like the old days where it's a quiet chat in the pub, this becomes public within minutes. 'I accept there was no malice behind the issue. Complainants of the subject of these types of offences need every encouragement that if they have the courage of their convictions they will have the protection of anonymity of this type, whatever the outcome, whether the prosecution is successful or not, they are entitled to that anonymity. 'The fear is, I dare not make a complaint because somebody might put my name on Twitter. 'The offence carries only a financial penalty. That's Parliament's decision, in my view these cases could be looked at far more seriously in terms of sanction.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Newsnight anchorman Jeremy Paxman at the Leveson Inquiry today . Former newspaper editor Piers Morgan was accused yesterday of telling Jeremy Paxman how to hack into a mobile phone. The BBC presenter said Mr Morgan also teased TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson about private conversations she had with Sven-Göran Eriksson. He said he was bemused by a conversation during a lunch at the headquarters of the Daily Mirror’s publisher at Canary Wharf in 2002. Earlier that year the tabloid had revealed that Miss Jonsson had had an affair with the then England football coach. The claims appear to contradict evidence given by Mr Morgan, now a New York-based talkshow host with CNN, to the Leveson Inquiry last year. Mr Morgan denied listening to Miss Jonsson’s voicemail messages to uncover the affair and said he did not believe phone hacking took place at the Mirror while he was editor. Last night he responded to the latest comments via Twitter, saying: ‘Right – that’s the last time I’m inviting Jeremy Paxman to lunch. Ungrateful little wretch.’ Mr Paxman told the inquiry into media standards yesterday that he attended a lunch hosted by Sir Victor Blank, the then chairman of Trinity Mirror, a decade ago. The Newsnight anchorman was seated beside Mr Morgan with Miss Jonsson, Sir Victor and Sir Philip Green, the Topshop billionaire sitting nearby. Mr Paxman said: ‘Morgan said, teasing Ulrika, that he knew what had happened in the conversations between her and Sven-Göran Eriksson and he went into this mock Swedish accent. ‘Now, I don’t know whether he was repeating a conversation that he had heard or he was imagining this conversation. In fact, to be fair to him, I think we should accept both possibilities, because he probably was imagining it. It was a rather bad parody.’ Piers Morgan, former Daily Mirror and News of the World editor, pictured giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry in December 2011 via video link from the US . BBC journalist Andrew Marr admitted at the Leveson Inquiry yesterday that an interview in which he asked former Prime Minister Gordon Brown if he was taking prescription painkillers was 'not a moment I look back on in my career with enormous enthusiasm or pride' The veteran presenter said Mr Morgan’s treatment of Miss Jonsson was close to bullying. ‘I didn’t like it,’ he said. Mr Paxman said Mr Morgan then explained to him intricate details of how the phone hacking scam was undertaken. He added: ‘He turned to me and said, “Have you got a mobile phone?”, I said, “Yes”, and he said, “Have you got a security setting on the message bit of it?” ‘I don’t think it was called voicemail in those days, I didn’t know what he was talking about. He then explained that the way to get access to people’s messages was to go to the factory default setting and press either 0000 or 1234 and that if you didn’t put on your own code, in his words, “you’re a fool”.’ Mr Paxman said: ‘I don’t know whether he was making this up, making up the conversation, but it was clearly something that he was familiar with and I wasn’t. I didn’t know that this went on.’ Last December, Mr Morgan told the Leveson Inquiry that he had little memory of the lunch and denied telling Miss Jonsson to change the PIN on her mobile phone. Speaking via video link, he said he did not remember ‘the specifics’ and described claims that he had hacked Miss Jonsson’s voicemail as ‘absolute nonsense’. He said he was given a tip-off about the affair in 2002 and said Miss Jonsson’s press agent had confirmed it. Lord Justice Leveson said a ombudsman with statutory powers to resolve disputes between newspapers and complainants may be needed to ensure effective regulation of the Press . An ombudsman with statutory powers to resolve disputes between newspapers and complainants may be needed to ensure effective regulation of the Press, Lord Justice Leveson said yesterday. But he insisted that giving legal authority to an independent arbiter would not amount to state control of the Press. His comments came during exchanges with former Conservative minister Stephen Dorrell at the inquiry into media standards and ethics. Lord Justice Leveson told Mr Dorrell that new statutes would be needed to make an ombudsman’s decisions legally binding in disputes. ‘I’ve not said the state should have a view of what is good practice,’ he said. ‘I am not suggesting that the state should have any view on the content.’ But he added that ‘the state should have a view on the mechanisms that are set up’ to regulate the Press. Mr Dorrell, who as Heritage Secretary between 1994 and 1995 had responsibility for media policy, told the inquiry he was ‘deeply sceptical’ about the need for statutory regulation. He added that the Government needed to be careful that by introducing legislation ‘you don’t create a cure that’s worse than the disease’. Mr Dorrell said recent wrongdoing such as phone hacking was a failure of management not of regulation. He told the inquiry that the Conservatives had decided to ‘do nothing’ with the Calcutt report into Press reforms, which proposed outlawing doorstepping of people in the news by reporters, bugging and long-lens photography. Mr Dorrell said John Major’s government decided that it would not be practical to implement the measures and that there was not a public appetite for the reforms. It much preferred self-regulation. Mr Dorrell was shown a Daily Mail comment piece from the time which criticised the Tory government’s consideration of privacy legislation and Press regulation. He said: ‘Government is a political organisation, and I was told early in my political life that any man can have friends but it takes a wise man to have the right enemies. You have to pick which battles you are going to fight.’",Mr Morgan responded by joking: 'Right - that's the last time I'm inviting Jeremy Paxman to lunch. Ungrateful little wretch.'

Around 100 animals were hurled into a 20ft-deep ditch apparently dug using heavy machinery, suggesting government officials may be behind the killings, say activists. Once inside, earth was reportedly shovelled on top of them, leaving to them to suffocate. One puppy and three adult dogs were rescued after a charity was called in to investigate. Condemned to death? Animal welfare campaigners found more than 100 stray dogs (above), including several puppies in a 20ft-deep ditch before they were allegedly buried alive by government officials in China . Horrific: Charity workers attempt to dig down into the newly filled-in pit where  around 100 stray dogs were seen a day earlier. A handful of dogs were rescued after whimpering was heard coming from under the ground . The Yinchuan Dawn Pets Home group . investigated after a woman searching for her pet dog near a garbage dump . in Alxa League, near China's border with Mongolia, where dogs are . regarded as vermin, told them that the animals were trapped last . Wednesday. Chinese internet users expressed outrage . after pictures of the dogs before the alleged burial were posted by the . charity on Sina Weibo - China's version of Twitter. When the charity visited the site the following day, they found that the pit had been filled in. Animal . rights campaigner Li Yeh, 28, said: 'We had a call from a member of the . public that there were some dogs in a hole, but when we went there the . next day it had been filled in. 'We could even hear some whimpering when we started to dig down.' One of the lucky ones: Only this tiny puppy and several adults were rescued after a charity was called in to investigate by a member of the public who stumbled across the pit . In safe hands: The only puppy to be rescued is nursed back to health after narrowly escaping suffocation . Another charity worker said: 'Even by local standards this was a barbaric and heartless act. 'When volunteers arrived the next day they saw the trench filled in but heard the plaintive cries of some dogs near the surface. A handful were rescued, severely traumatised but alive.' A charity volunteer told AFP that another visit was made on Friday, but by then it appeared that the dead dogs had been moved elsewhere in what the group said was an attempt by local officials responsible for enforcing city laws - called Chengguan in China - to hide the grim burial. 'We hired an excavator and found in the place where the dogs were buried six dead dogs which were damaged by an excavator before we got there,' the volunteer surnamed Fan told AFP. 'These dogs all had soil in their mouths and noses, which means before we arrived at the scene local Chengguan had already transferred the dogs' bodies to another secret place.'

Cover-up? A charity volunteer said another visit was made the next day, but by then it appeared that the dead dogs had been moved in what the group said was an attempt by local officials to hide the grim burial . An official from the local Chengguan office denied the allegations and said an investigation had been launched. 'We are investigating if some stray dogs were buried alive,' the official told AFP. 'I can ensure you we didn't do this kind of thing, and moreover, we are not in charge of stray dogs.' Officially called the City Urban Administrative and Law Enforcement Bureau, the Chengguan operate in every community in China. The Chengguan have a reputation for heartless treatment of the people they monitor - often the poorest in Chinese society. Earlier this month, four of them were beaten almost to death by a mob after they witnessed an officer kill a street trader with a hammer.","Around 100 animals were found in 20ft-deep pit near Mongolian border .

"By . Jack Doyle . Launch: Uganda is among the African nations with plans to develop its own rocket . Four other African countries in receipt of hundreds of millions of pounds in British aid have their own space programmes, the Mail can reveal. The row over aid spending intensified yesterday when it emerged Britain is pumping more than a billion pounds into oil-rich Nigeria which has plans to put a man in space. But taxpayers are also funding aid programmes in South Africa, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya – all of which have their own space agencies. Many are in their early stages, but include ambitious and expensive plans for satellites and even rockets. Over the five years of this Government, the four nations will receive more than £1.5billion from British taxpayers. Kenya will be handed the most, a total of £596million, followed by Uganda which is getting £480million. Ghana will receive £460million. South Africa will be given £112million – almost as much as it spends on its space programme. The long-standing project  is estimated to cost some £110million  a year. In May ministers announced direct aid to South Africa would end in 2015. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said it was now the region’s ‘economic powerhouse’ and was ‘in a position to fund its own development’. But until then it will still be handed some £19million a year. The South African National Space Agency was founded in 2009 – the same year that the first South African government-owned satellite was launched on a Russian rocket. It cost an estimated £1.7million and collects images for agriculture, water management and urban planning. Kenya’s space agency was set up last year and the country’s politicians have made clear their intentions to get a satellite into space. Uganda also has a space research programme, paid for in part by its government, and plans for a satellite and rocket. Ludicrous: Despite millions of Africans living in extreme poverty, governments are spending huge sums on space programmes . Ghana’s Space Science and Technology Centre is thought to be several years away from putting a satellite into space. The revelations will intensify pressure on ministers over Britain’s spiralling aid spending. The Department for International Development’s budget will rise by 35 per cent in real terms by 2015, at  the same time as spending on areas of critical national importance such as the police, military and immigration is being slashed. Britain is also handing about £280million a year in aid to India, another country with its own space programme. Changes: International Development Secretary Justine Greening told South Africa it will no longer receive direct aid by 2015 . The row was sparked by comments from UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom who said it was folly to give billions in aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’. He was widely criticised for using the term ‘Bongo Bongo land’ but many commentators believe he was right about the building resentment over foreign aid. He said: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month, when we’re in this sort of debt, to Bongo Bongo land is completely beyond me.’ And he claimed foreign leaders frittered aid money away on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris and Ferraris’. On Thursday David Cameron said the remarks were offensive and accused Mr Bloom of being guilty of a ‘stop the world I want to get off’ approach to foreign aid. But the revelations that oil-rich Nigeria, which is receiving £300million in British aid this year alone, had ambitious plans to launch its own rockets sparked fury. Critics asked why Britain was, in effect, subsidising a space programme for a nation where 70 per cent of people live below the poverty line. Backbench Tory MP Philip Davies said it was ‘totally unjustifiable and unaffordable’ for Britain to give this money to Nigeria, given the scale of its ‘grandiose’ space programme. But the Department for International Development has defended its aid spending, saying the money goes to poverty reduction, health and education programmes, and would benefit Britain by cutting immigration and crime.","South Africa, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya all have space agencies .

Turner, who was already on death row for murdering 10 women, was sentenced for four more murders. 'It is the order of this court that you should suffer the death penalty,' Superior Court Judge Robert Perry said. Second death sentence: Chester Turner, 47, has killed 14 women and is on death row . Physical evidence: Chester Turner was serving a prison sentence after pleading no contest to a rape charge in 2002 when he was linked by DNA evidence to the killings of a dozen women . Turner was one of several serial killers who stalked Los Angeles-area women during a crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s that led some women into prostitution to support their drug habits, authorities said. The 47-year-old Turner is one of three . men now blamed for the murders of women who typically were raped and . strangled. The attacks were dubbed the Southside Slayer killings before authorities concluded more than one attacker was involved.

"By . James Salmon . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Lloyds has racked up yet another bill of more than £1billion for mis-selling to customers and rigging interest rates. The staggering cost was revealed yesterday, as the state-backed lender announced a sharp fall in profits in the first half of the year. It has set aside another £600m to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance, taking its total bill for the scandal to £10.4billion. This equates to around £420 for every household in the UK, or an increase of 2p on income tax. The total bill across the industry for PPI now tops £23billion, making it the most expensive mis-selling scandal to hit the UK. Lloyds has set aside another £600m to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance, taking its total bill for the scandal to £10.4billion . But Lloyds, which is still 25pc owned by taxpayers, also revealed a £225million provision for other ‘legacy issues’. The bulk of this money will be spent on trawling through past sales of investments and protection policies - paying compensation where necessary. The bank was fined £28million by the City watchdog last year for promoting a ruthless sales culture, where some workers were told their pay would be halved if they missed sales targets. Staff were also handed ‘grand in hand’ and ‘champagne bonuses’ for selling customers investments they did not want or need. A £218million fine from UK and US regulators for rigging interest rates and defrauding British taxpayers was also included in the £1.1billion provision for wrongdoing announced yesterday. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said employees ‘clearly broke the law’ after a series of banking scandals . Last night one MP expressed alarm at the spiralling bill. Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, said: ‘It beggars belief that just one bank has had to pay over £10billion for PPI, which is the equivalent of more than 2p on income tax for every household in the UK. The sheer scale of continuing provisions for fines and misdemeanours suggests there is much more to do to reform the culture of banks in the UK.’ The mis-selling costs caused Lloyds profits to more than half to £863million, from £2.1billion in the same period last year. It caps a torrid week for the lender, which could face a criminal investigation from the Serious Fraud Office for an extraordinary scam to defraud taxpayers. Lloyds was hit on Monday with a £218million fine from UK and US regulators for rigging Libor interest rates. Its traders also manipulated a separate rate used to set the fees to access more than £90 billion in emergency loans from a taxpayer-backed scheme run by the Bank of England during the financial crisis. Between April 2008 and September 2009, four traders shortchanged the Treasury by cutting £7.8million off the fees. In a furious letter Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the employees ‘clearly broke the law’ and could be guilty of ‘criminal conduct’. The fine was included in the £1.1billion hit for misconduct. Yesterday Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio, who took the helm in 2011, apologised to customers and shareholders. He said: ‘This was as shocking to us as it was to you. We always knew we had legacy issues but this was probably the most disturbing. I’m sorry for the impact these actions have had on customers, colleagues and shareholder.’ The banks is now pursuing disciplinary action against 22 former and current staff, all of who have now been suspended. The Bank of England this week announced tougher powers to strip rogue bankers of bonuses up to seven years after they were awarded – even if they have spent it. But the new regime will only come into force on January 1 and will not be applied retrospectively. Andy Silvester from the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Lloyds has acted reprehensibly for years, treating the very taxpayers who ended up bailing it out more like cash cows than customers. The bank has to be returned to private hands as soon as practically possible.’","State-backed lender announced a fall in profits in the first half of the year .

"By . Darren Boyle . Sheriff Alan Miller told Glasgow Sheriff's Court that he would adjourn a criminal trial because he had tickets to the Commonwealth Games . A judge adjourned a criminal trial of a police officer accused of assaulting his partner because he had tickets for the Commonwealth Games. Sheriff Alan Miller told Glasgow Sheriff's Court that he was adjourning proceedings on Wednesday after both the prosecution and defence had finished their cases. Under Scottish judicial rules the Sheriff had to sum up both cases and then issue his verdict. The case is expected to resume today. Sheriff Miller adjourned proceedings at 3.50pm as he had tickets for the 6.30pm athletics session, even though the Hampden Park venue was only a ten minute drive away. Wednesday's main event featured Kenya's David Rudisha scoop gold in the men's 800 metres. A spokesperson for the Judicial Office for Scotland said: 'Shortly before 4pm, at the close of evidence, all parties agreed it would be an appropriate point to adjourn. 'Sheriff Miller had an engagement at the Commonwealth Games.' However, Scottish Conservative justice spokeswoman Margaret Mitchell criticised the decision to adjourn the case to go to the sporting event. She told The Sun: 'Valuable court time has been wasted.' The Taxpayers' Alliance added: 'Justice shouldn't wait because a judge had tickets to the Commonwealth Games.' Sheriff Miller was appointed to the bench full-time on May 6, 2010 having served part-time for five years to the £128,000-a-year role.

"By . James Slack . Gary McKinnon (pictured with mother Janis Sharp) has been warned not to visit his sick father in Scotland in case the US Attorney General puts pressure on the SNP to extradite him to America . Gary McKinnon has been warned not to visit his sick father in Scotland in case the Nationalist government allows a revived American bid to extradite him. The Asperger’s sufferer was saved by a Daily Mail campaign in 2012 from previous attempts to take him to the United States for trial on hacking charges. He is wanted for getting into Pentagon and NASA computers while looking for evidence of aliens. Now, almost two years on, the 48-year-old wants to visit his sick father Charlie, who is in a Scottish hospital after suffering a stroke. But the senior lawyers who helped fight his ten-year campaign against extradition have told Gary not to risk going north of the border to the country of his birth. Karen Todner and Edward Fitzgerald QC said he should only do so if the SNP-run administration declares categorically that it will abide by the refusal to allow extradition by Theresa May. The Americans were furious at the Home Secretary’s decision in October 2012. She said there was a grave risk that Gary, rated a serious suicide risk by doctors, would take his own life if bundled on a plane. But there are now fears that the US Attorney General could try again as it applies only in England and Wales. If Gary went to Scotland, he would be covered by its separate legal system. His mother, Janis Sharp, told the Mail that the Scottish Government had so far failed to give assurances it would turn down any new US request. ‘I’d have thought it would be very easy for them to do,’ she said. ‘Gary is extremely upset. ‘It seems ludicrous that he can’t safely visit the land he was born in, even to see his father who has been hospitalised after a stroke.’ A Scottish government spokesman stopped short of giving the unequivocal backing the McKinnon family needs. ‘While we do not comment on individual cases, there is no reason to suppose that anyone for whom extradition was refused in the rest of the UK would necessarily see it granted in Scotland,’ she said. ‘Scottish Ministers also have no power to act in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights.’ Mr McKinnon was due to be extradited to America in 2012 after he hacked into Pentagon and NASA computers while looking for evidence of aliens. Home Secretary Theresa May blocked the request at the last minute . Gary has rebuilt his life after his long legal fight, launching a company, Small SEO, a website where he charges to help businesses get mentioned in search results. The US administration had been convinced that Mrs May would approve the hacker’s extradition. The Ambassador in London was left fuming when he learnt of her decision, only hours before Gary was expected to be put on a plane. Douglas McNabb, a lawyer who specialises in US federal law and international extradition, warned at the time that the Americans could attempt to revive the extradition if Gary ever left the UK. The Americans have been determined to get their man, rebuffing repeated private requests from British politicians for Gary to be prosecuted in the UK instead. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown appealed for him to be allowed to serve any prison sentence in Britain, the latest WikiLeaks documents revealed. David Blunkett also twice pleaded for Gary to face trial by video link.","Gary McKinnon narrowly avoided being extradited to America in 2012 .

"By . James  Nye . and David Mccormack . The Atlanta teen initially denied a place on the nation's heart transplant waiting list because of the vague reason of 'non-compliance', has finally received a new heart. Diagnosed with an enlarged heart and given six months to live, Anthony Stokes, 15, and his family had labeled Children's Healthcare of Atlanta's seemingly arbitrary decision as a 'death sentence'. Stokes underwent surgery on Tuesday evening, just 10 days after his family complained publicly that he . was unfairly rejected because of past failure to take . medicine and show up for doctors' appointments. Lifesaving surgery: Anthony Stokes, 15, has had the heart transplant he desperately required (picture taken prior to surgery) Civil rights groups became involved with . the case last week and Stokes' mother Melencia Hamilton gave several . emotional interviews to Atlanta television stations. A few days later, the hospital reversed course and added Stokes, who suffered from a weakened, enlarged heart that couldn't pump blood efficiently, to its waiting list. Stokes is currently recovering in the intensive care unit of . Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Wednesday, reports the . Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Citing . patient privacy, the hospital would not release further details of the . case but said it has performed 10 heart transplants so far this year, . three in the past week. Relief: Melencia Hamilton, Anthony Stokes' mother has said that she will ensure her son complies with all necessary medications needed to allow the transplant to take . While . a history of non-compliance could mean doctors were worried that Stokes . would not take medication to ensure a successful transplant, his family . said the truth was that Anthony's low grades at school and a brush with . the law meant the hospital initially refused him the surgery. After the hospital has changed its mind, Hamilton assured ABC News that her son would follow every instruction needed to ensure a succesful transplant. 'I know he will comply with all the rules,' said a crying Melencia Hamilton. 'He will take his medicine because he knows that is how he has to live.' Previously sentenced to a period of house arrest following a brawl to protect his younger brother, Stokes was admitted to hospital with his ankle bracelet still attached. 'He was just fighting,' Hamilton said. 'Trying to take up, just trying to take up for his brother because somebody was bullying his brother.' Outraged: Christine Young Brown of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference joined with Anthony Stokes' mother Melencia Hamilton (right) to condemn the initial decision to refuse Anthony surgery . Denied: Anthony Stokes had had a brush with the law - which his family felt was at least part of the reason why he was initially denied a heart transplant . Illness: Stokes was diagnosed with a heart complaint in July and desperately needed a heart transplant . Last year 319 people on the . transplant list did not survive long enough to receive a new organ and . currently there are nine children on the list. 'He's . been given a death sentence because of a broad and vague excuse of . noncompliance. There was nothing specific in that decision. Just . noncompliance,' said Christine Young Brown of Southern Christian . Leadership Conference, prior to the hospital changing its mind. Previously healthy, Anthony only discovered last month that his heart was failing. Despite . specialists informing Anthony and his family that he has less than a . year to live, they also sent them a letter on August 7, explaining why . he wouldn't be put on the transplant list. 'The decision was made that Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of non-compliance, which is one of our center’s contraindications to listing for heart transplant,' explained the devastating letter. Diagnosis: Anthony Stokes was given just six months to live if he didn't get the heart transplant . 'As we discussed today with Anthony’s . mother, we will not place Anthony on the heart transplant waiting list . at this time due to this decision,' the letter continued. The hospital initially refuted any claims of mismanagement in a statement in which they repeat their claims of careful management of the transplant list. 'The well-being of our patients is always our first priority. We are continuing to work with this family and looking at all options regarding this patient's health care,' said Children's Healthcare of Atlanta spokeswoman Patty Gregory. 'We follow very specific criteria in determining eligibility for a transplant of any kind.' Anthony's mother described earlier this week the moment she was told by the hospital her son would not be getting the transplant he needs to live. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston wrote Anthony Stokes a letter informing him that his history of 'non-compliance' is the reason why he was not being considered for a heart transplant . Support: The teen surrounded by his friends and family - he is now recovering from surgery (photo from before operation) 'Doctor came in and said he's not a candidate. He's not a candidate for a heart transplant,' said Hamilton. Family members said that the hospital explained that they fear that Anthony won't follow the strict plan of medication and follow-up treatments necessary for the transplant to succeed. It is not clear what evidence of 'non-compliance' the hospital is basing their decision on. 'We must save Anthony's life. We don't have a lot of time to do it, but it's something that must be done,' said Mack Major, Stokes' mentor.","Anthony Stokes, 15, successfully underwent heart transplant surgery on Tuesday evening .

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has expressed his outrage at Australia's attempt to hide the investigation in which he is implicated. Outgoing Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (right) has called for the Australian government to be 'open' and 'transparent' 'I ask that Australia issue a statement that both [former president] Megawati [Sukarnoputri] and my names are unstained, and so they do not defame other Indonesian officials.

Dr Yudhoyono then wrote to his more than 5 million followers on Twitter in Indonesian: 'The Government of Australia should be completely open and make transparent its law enforcement process and not cover it up.' Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is hiding in the Ecuadorian Embassy, has published all the details of the case on Wikileaks . The president added: 'The Government of Australia should not issue policies or statements that may raise suspicion about people who are outside Australia.' Daily Mail Australia cannot report some of the contents of the Victorian Supreme Court case. On Wednesday it was revealed Twitter and Google+ users may face legal action for sharing the Wikileaks publication of the court suppression order. The anti-secrecy website published full details of  the legal suppression order issued by the Victorian Supreme Court on June 19. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has expressed his outrage at Australia's attempt to hide the case . Exiled Wikileaks leader Julian Assange has come out in defence of the Wikileaks publication, describing the suppression order as one of the worst of its kind 'in living memory'. Wikileaks published the full text of the order, the contents of which Australian media organisations are legally prevented from publishing. The court order was reportedly made to prevent damage to Australian international relations. But Wikileaks claimed the gag order effectively blacked out the largest high-level case in Australia and the region. From inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, Julian Assange made a statement saying, 'the Australian government is not just gagging the Australian press it is blindfolding the Australian public' 'It is in the public interest for the press to be able to report on this case,' he said. Mr Assange has been holed up in the embassy for two years in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations. He said Wikileaks worked to protect Australians' right to know even when the Government tried to block it. Mr Assange criticised the move to block the public's right to know and suppress the media, especially in international cases involving politicians and subsidiaries of a public organisation.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Eight months after begging the public for any information that could lead to finding his wife's killers, Kassim Alhimidi himself was arrested and charged with the homicide. Police arrested Alhimidi, 48, of El Cajon, Calif., Thursday for . the murder of his 32-year-old wife, Shaima Alawadi, according to ABC News affiliate KGO. Alawadi's family called her death a hate crime after she was found . beaten with a tire iron in her living room with a note calling her 'a terrorist.' Arrest: Alhimidi, pictured in 2012, was arrested and charged in his wife's death months after telling the press that it was a hate crime perpetrated by racists . Attack: Mrs Alawadi (left) was found close to death by her 17-year-old daughter Fatima Al Himidi (right) at the family home in El Cajon, California, last Wednesday . He is charged with first degree murder. The death of the mother of five sent shockwaves through El Cajon, which is home to one of the . nation's largest concentrations of Iraqi immigrants. Shortly after the homicide, Alhimidi was in court making emotional pleas to his wife's 'killer' and begging for information. This past March as his 15-year-old son Mohammed translated from Arabic, Alhimidi said: 'The main question we would like to ask is what are you getting out of this and why did you do it?' He was addressing reporters at a mosque east of San Diego after her memorial service. She was found unconscious by her teenage daughter in the dining room of the family home in El Cajon, one of the nation's largest enclaves of Iraqi immigrants. Fatima Al Himidi,  17, told a television station that the note said: 'Go back to your country, you terrorist.' At the time, Alhidi claimed he was out of the house at the time of the attack. El Cajon police said the note found next to her body initially led investigators to regard the killing as a possible hate crime. Chief James Redman said there was other evidence and called the killing an isolated incident. The family also told police they had found a similar note earlier this month but did not report it to authorities. Final journey: Family and friends escort Mrs Alawadi's body to a waiting hearse following the memorial service in 2012 . Media interest: Surrounded by reporters, a hearse carrying Mrs Alawadi leaves for San Diego airport where her body will be flown to Iraq . However, search warrants viewed by KGO revealed that divorce papers had been found in Alawadi's car  but had not been filled out. The . victim and her family left Iraq in the early 1990s after a failed . Shiite uprising, living in Saudi Arabian refugee camps before coming to . the U.S. Saddam Hussain's troops hanged Mrs Alawadi's uncle. Crime scene: The fatal attack took place at the family's house, pictured, in El Cajon, California . The family arrived in the Detroit, Michigan, area in 1993 and had moved to San Diego only shortly before the murder. Alawadi was a religious Shiite Muslim who wore a hijab; her father Sayed Nabeel Alawadi is a cleric in Iraq. The victim's body was taken to San Diego airport and is now in Najaf, Iraq. He is scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 13.","Police found unfiled divorce papers in husband Kassim Alhimidi's car .

"By . David Wilkes . The £50million Hollywood mansion already boasted ‘a masterful opulence once only reserved for nobility’ — or so the estate agents’ blurb went when she bought it. But, clearly, this was still not quite grand enough for Petra Ecclestone, the 25-year-old daughter of Formula 1 mogul Bernie Ecclestone. So having bought it, she was keen to impose her own unique taste on the 56,000 sq ft property and turn it into her own little palace as quickly as possible. Scroll down for video . Hollywood palace: Petra Ecclestone bought her 57,000 sq ft  homefor £50million, and now wants £88million for it . But there is . also something of a car-crash about the wide range of art which the . couple chose to decorate many of the rooms. It reportedly stretches all . the way from twin 5ft sculptures of Pamela Andersons in a bikini, to the . Old Masters portraits, including work by Van Dyck, which Mr Stunt . collects and which line the hallway. The . 123-room house, claimed to rival the White House in size and built in . 1991 in the style of a French chateau, belonged to the late U.S. film . and television producer Aaron Spelling, the creator of Charlie’s Angels . and Dynasty, and his wife Candy. Petra . bought it for £50 million in 2011. Soon after she began the startling . make-over, which took just 12 weeks — three weeks to plan and nine to . install, involving an army of 500 workers and costing £15 million. She has now put it on the market for £88 million so stands to make an eye-watering £23 million profit — if she can find a buyer. Petra Ecclestone, the 25-year-old daughter of Formula 1 mogul Bernie Ecclestone, bought the home in 2011 . Out went the chintz and more traditional trappings of the previous owners and in came a new look that is undeniably dramatic, some might even say jaw-dropping... or, dare one even suggest, just a little bit showy? From the white marble floor with bold black stripes of the hallway, through the cavernous his and hers closets where Petra and her businessman husband James Stunt keep rack upon rack of designer clothes and cabinets crammed with top-end watches, to the three deep-buttoned gold hairdressing stations and two ‘mani-pedi’ chairs - so Petra and friends can have a manicure and pedicure after having their hair coiffed - in the beauty salon bedecked with pictures of Marilyn Monroe, little could be called understated. There are brown hues in some parts of the mansion, and Petra has described the look as ‘very dark and kind of sexy with a boudoir feel’. The sprawling house also features a specially designed dog pampering room and a ‘nightclub’ in the basement complete with bowling alley and pool room. Set in five acres, it has space for at least 100 cars — handy if you’re having a few friends round, presumably — and has an outdoor swimming pool and tennis court. Petra married Mr Stunt in a £12million ceremony at Odescalchi Castle near Rome in 2011. She gave birth to the couple’s first child, Lavinia, in February last year. In a recent interview with W magazine about her remodelling of the house, Petra said: ‘I know the house is huge, but with the other houses we looked at that were a similar size to this, you felt like you were in a museum. They didn’t feel homely. I think because there was a family here previously it was warmer and cosier.’","The 25-year-old daughter of motorsport magnate Bernie Ecclestone bought opulent home for £50million .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Japanese fishermen have finished killing some of the 250 dolphins trapped in what activists say was the biggest round-up they have witnessed in the last four years. Sea Shepherd, best known for its anti-whaling activities, said the fishermen first selected 52 dolphins to keep alive for sale to aquariums and other customers. They included a rare albino calf worth millions whose mother it reports may have committed suicide after being torn apart from her baby in the brutal separation process in Taiji. Speculation has been rife ever since Sea Shepherd volunteers witnessed her diving under water then failing to resurface with the rest of the pod. Experts say dolphins have been known to commit suicide in captivity after becoming distressed and confused at their conditions. Scroll down for videos . Did she kill herself? There is speculation that the mother of this albino dolphin trapped by Japanese fishermen in a cove has committed suicide after being torn apart from her baby . The pod of dolphins being held captive in the cove on the coast of Japan . Harsh conditions: These poles are deployed above the water, and then the fishermen hit a flange on the top of the poles with a hammer, creating a cacophony that drives the dolphins back out to sea . In several cases, the creatures repeatedly slammed their head against sides of a pool - or simply stopped coming up for air. Writing on its website, Sea Shepherd said: 'There is widespread speculation that the mother of the albino calf committed suicide after her baby was violently taken from her. 'Our volunteer Cove Guardians documented and witnessed the grieving mother repeatedly spy-hopping, looking for her calf, before lowering herself into the water, never to resurface. 'Dolphins are highly intelligent, socially complex beings who form close bonds with their family, and the trade for captivity regularly rips through these bonds in Taiji.' The theory has been taken up by Ric O' Barry, a former dolphin trainer . who is convinced the mother took her own life as a result of the ordeal. Annual process: The fishing crew are pictured transferring several dolphins into the 250-strong pod . Rounded up: The dolphins were forced to wait in the pen for 19 hours until the holding reached critical mass . As conscious breathers, he said dolphins can choose not to take their next breath. Mr O'Barry, who founded the Dolphin Project,  told The Dodo: 'People don't believe me, but dolphins do it all the time. 'Captivity is extremely stressful and there is nothing more stressful to a dolphin than taking away its calf.' The fishermen reportedly hid the baby dolphin under a tarpaulin and transferred it to Taiji Whale Museum. Assistant Director Tetsuo Kirihata said: 'Albinos stand out and tend to be targeted by predators. 'She must have been protected by her mother and her mates. We will take good care of her.' Tradition: Each year the fishermen capture and kill a huge amount of dolphins, putting the population at risk . One of the crusaders from Sea Sheperd, who hope to bring the dolphin's plight to light (left). The fishermen preparing their nets to capture the next pod of dolphins (right) The albino dolphin is one of the rarest from this current batch of captured bottlenoses . Mr . Barry - who used to train Dolphins for the TV series Flipper - became . an activist in the 1970s after being left traumatised when one of the show's stars, Kathy, died in . his arms. He has always asserted that she had committed suicide by refusing to breathe after spending years in captivity. There . have been previous cases of suspected dolphin suicides, the largest of . which occurred in 2007 when 152 striped dolphins washed up on the coast . of southern Iran. Locals who . battled to save them by taking them back out to sea were distraught . when the dolphins refused and persistently re-beached themselves to die. A year later, one expert theorised that the deaths of 26 dolphins on a beach in Cornwall have been a mass suicide. The animals had died after inhaling debris and mud that clogged their insides. Heavy machinery: Fishermen hoist a dolphin out of the sea, on its way to either lifetime captivity or death . Speaking . at the time, Veterinary wildlife pathologist Vic Simpson said: 'On the . face of it, it looks like some sort of mass suicide - but the question . is why? 'The dolphins had . swallowed and inhaled big chunks of mud from the estuary. Their lungs . and stomachs were full of it. That is very bizarre indeed. 'We have seen strandings on beaches, sometimes with five to seven dolphins - but never on a scale like this.' However, other experts are far more sceptical. Dr . Ann Weaver, who studies dolphins in Tampa Bay, believes suicide is a . uniquely human notion, although she did acknowledge that animals can get . depressed. She said: 'I think everything they are designed to be is to keep on keeping on. 'So . I think suicide is the curse of the human consciousness, but not other . consciousnesses, she told told the Huffington Post in 2010. Of . the rest of the 250 dolphins trapped in the Japanese cove, about 40 were killed, . one became stuck in a net and drowned and the others were released, Sea . Shepherd said. A video . released Tuesday by Sea Shepherd shows dozens of fishermen on boats . surveying the dolphins after they were confined to a cove with nets. Divers can be seen holding the dolphins selected for sale and guiding them to nets hanging off the boats. Boat: 'Banger boats' use poles and flanges to make unpleasant sounds, driving the dolphins to specific places .

"By . Associated Press . Wanted fugitive Jose Manuel Garcia Guevara was brought back to Louisiana on Wednesday after he allegedly murdered a woman in front of her son in 2008 . A fugitive on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List for allegedly raping and fatally stabbing a woman in front of her four-year-old son has been extradited back to the U.S. after surrendering in Mexico last year. Jose Manuel Garcia Guevara, 26, was brought back to Lake Charles, Louisiana on Wednesday, where the heinous crime took place. The FBI reported on its website that Guevara, a Mexican national, handed himself in to authorities after six years on the run. 'This fugitive investigation and extradition could not have been possible without the tremendous cooperation and collaboration of federal, state, local, and international law enforcement partners,' stated Michael J. Anderson, Special Agent in Charge, FBI New Orleans. Guevara is accused of breaking into 26-year-old Wanda Barton's mobile home in Lake Charles on February 19, 2008. Once inside the home, he allegedly raped her before stabbing her to death in the presence of her then four-year-old stepson. Guevara was an illegal alien working local construction and lived with four roommates next door to the Bartons. State authorities in 2008 charged Guevara with second-degree murder, aggravated rape and aggravated burglary. A federal warrant was issued for his arrest in 2009. Guevara, placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list last year, was the 499th name to be added to the list, which initially started in 1950, according to the FBI website. Wanda Barton was allegedly raped and murdered in front of her then four-year-old son in 2008 by Jose Manuel Garcia Guevara . Guevara was accompanied by FBI agents and arrived to the U.S. on Wednesday. He was brought to local authorities in the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff’s Office and awaits arraignment on state charges. At the time of his wife's murder, Kevin Barton told KPLC: 'She was the . best kind of person. Always smiling, always happy, . always willing to do any new adventure. 'She had a lot of firsts with me. I gave her the best life I could give her.' At the time of the . murder, authorities believed he had purchased a bus ticket to Dallas in an effort to cross the Mexican border. Guevara was not charged with first-degree murder due to an extradition treaty which exists between Mexico and the U.S., according to the Sulphur Daily News. The agreement means citizens cannot face capital punishment or first-degree murder charges when they are returned to the U.S. Guevara (pictured left in an undated shot) was living illegally in the U.S. when he murdered Mrs Barton.

"By . Associated Press . An 89-year-old Nazi war crimes suspect died in custody hours before a U.S. ruling Wednesday that he should be extradited to Germany to face trial. Johann Breyer died Tuesday night at a Philadelphia hospital, where he had been transferred Saturday after a month in jail, his lawyer and the U.S. Marshals Service said. His death was disclosed Wednesday just as U.S. Magistrate Timothy Rice approved the extradition request, which would still have needed final U.S. government review. Pictured as a young Nazi in World War II and again in his declining years, Johann Breyer died Tuesday night in a Philadelphia hospital only hours before a U.S. ruling that he should be extradited to Germany for trial . Rice found probable cause that Breyer . was the person being sought by German authorities over his suspected . service as an SS guard at Auschwitz during World War II. 'No statute of limitations offers a safe haven for murder,' he wrote in his ruling. U.S. marshals had arrested Breyer in June outside his longtime home in Philadelphia. He was facing charges of aiding in the killing of 216,000 Jewish men, women and children at a Nazi death camp. 'As outlined by Germany, a death camp guard such as Breyer could not have served at Auschwitz during the peak of the Nazi reign of terror in 1944 without knowing that hundreds of thousands of human beings were being brutally slaughtered in gas chambers and then burned on site,' Rice wrote. 'A daily parade of freight trains delivered hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children, most of whom simply vanished overnight. Yet, the screams, the smells, and the pall of death permeated the air. The allegations establish that Breyer can no longer deceive himself and others of his complicity in such horror,' the judge said. Breyer claimed he was unaware of the massive slaughter at Auschwitz and then that he did not participate in it, but 'the German allegations belie his claims,' the judge wrote. Breyer died at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, according to his lawyer, Dennis Boyle, and the Marshals Service. The lawyer said Breyer's health had deteriorated in jail but he didn't know the cause of death. German authorities in the Bavarian town of Weiden issued a 2013 warrant charging Breyer with accessory to murder under the theory that the death camp's sole function was to kill people. The same legal strategy had been used to charge and convict former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk on charges he served as a death camp guard at Sobibor in occupied Poland. Demjanjuk died in a Bavarian nursing home in 2012 while appealing his 2011 conviction. The 2013 warrant accused Breyer of 158 counts of accessory to murder — one count for each trainload of victims brought to the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland from May to October 1944, when he was allegedly a guard there. 'It is particularly unfortunate that Breyer could not be brought to justice in view of the significant efforts that were invested in trying to hold him accountable for his service at the Auschwitz death camp,' said Efraim Zuroff, the head Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem. 'This setback should in no way discourage or hamper the efforts to bring other perpetrators to justice at this time.' Breyer told The Associated Press in a 2012 interview that while he was a guard at Auschwitz, he was assigned to a part of the camp that was not involved in the slaughter of Jews and others. 'I didn't kill anybody, I didn't rape anybody — and I don't even have a traffic ticket here,' he said. 'I didn't do anything wrong.' Breyer told The Associated Press in a 2012 interview that while he was a guard at Auschwitz, he was assigned to a part of the camp that was not involved in the slaughter of Jews and others . Breyer moved to Philadelphia after World War II and for decades lived a quiet, middle-class life with his wife, children and grandchildren. He had American citizenship because his mother was born in the U.S.; she later moved to Europe, where Breyer was born. In 1992, the U.S. government tried to revoke Breyer's citizenship after discovering his wartime background. The effort became a yearslong legal saga and appeared to end with a 2003 decision that found Breyer had joined the SS as a minor and could therefore not be held legally responsible for participating in it. Then he was arrested last month outside his home in northeast Philadelphia based on the German warrant. Officials say the arrest was delayed for a year because of the complexity of the extradition request. His lawyers had unsuccessfully argued that Breyer should remain at home pending the extradition hearing because of his frail health. They said he has mild dementia, heart conditions and has suffered strokes in recent years. Rice initially ruled that the federal prison system was capable of caring for Breyer, although he reversed himself Monday after what he called the 'emergency hospitalization' and granted bail. Breyer's wife and survivors could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. Messages left at his home were not immediately returned. 'This hurts. This hurts the families of the victims. This hurts anyone who is interested in justice,' Zuroff said.","Johann Breyer, 89, died in custody in the hospital he had been transferred to after a month in jail .

"By . James Tozer . José Hampson: 'They're getting special treatment' Gipsies who falsely accused a grandmother of racial abuse are set to be given a new caravan site at a cost to the taxpayer of more than £500,000. The move has outraged people living near what is currently tranquil farmland, with at least two imminent house sales said to have fallen through as a result. The council behind the proposal has already spent £145,000 trying to throw the group off their existing camp on green belt land. And the gipsy family meant to benefit from the new site have said there is no guarantee they would move there in any case. The plan would see taxpayers provide a new site for five mobile homes belonging to the Linfoot family. Last year the family falsely claimed toy shop owner and community stalwart José Hampson, 78, had called them ‘dirty ******* gippos’ in a row over their illegal camp. Mrs Hampson, a widowed former Sunday school teacher, was given a criminal record after being found guilty of racially aggravated harassment, but after an 11-month nightmare her good name was restored when a judge quashed the conviction. Now the council has been told it must find the Linfoots a permanent site and residents of a quiet row of terraces this month learnt that farmland behind their homes had been chosen – despite being the most expensive of nine potential sites to develop, at £560,000. Mrs Hampson said: ‘I don’t see why they should receive special treatment like this, especially if it means another beautiful spot is spoiled as a result.’ The proposal has led to a campaign from residents of Cowling Road, the chosen site on the edge of the Lancashire market town of Chorley. Developing the fields - currently grazed by cattle - would require building an access road across land which is understood to have been given to the council by a former mayor for £1 on condition it was used to benefit the townspeople. Glenn Hutchinson, landlord of the adjacent Spinners pub, said: ‘It’s not the right place, it’s as simple as that. It’s a semi-rural location on the outskirts of town. All the residents around here are appalled we were not informed of this by the council even though dozens of others were consulted.’ The proposed site at Cowling Road on the edge of Chorley, Lancashire is currently grazed by cattle . Another resident said: ‘My fear is that they won’t stop at five caravans, we could see other travellers stopping off there as well.’ Chorley council identified nine potential sites for the Linfoots’ five caravans and earlier this month announced that it had chosen a site known as Cowling Farm. The proposal is now out for consultation. Chorley council had set aside £145,000 to evict the Linfoots from a plot of green belt land they own less than a mile away. But last year it was forced to give them temporary permission to stay after the Planning Inspectorate said the council had failed to make enough provision for travellers and gipsies. Council leader Alistair Bradley said: ‘Time and again decisions on what’s best for Chorley have been taken out of our hands by the Planning Inspectorate.’ Michael Linfoot pictured outside Preston Magistrates Court . The cost of developing the site – part of a larger plot earmarked for 158 homes – comprises a new access road, hard-standing, utilities, secure fencing and a play area. The council may be able to claim the cost back from central government. Despite all that, the Linfoots – who have lived in the Chorley area for 40 years – are undecided on whether they would even move in if it went ahead. ‘We haven’t even seen the site yet,’ said Michael Linfoot, a father of three whose wife Patty is governor of a local school. ‘There’s lots of details that would need to be ironed out.’ Michael Hargreaves, the Linfoots’ planning adviser, said there was a ‘chronic shortage’ of official traveller accommodation, with no new sites built in Chorley in 20 years. Ministers introduced new rules in 2012 aimed at letting local authorities decide how to accommodate travellers. ‘This Government has scrapped Labour’s top-down targets for traveller sites, increased Green Belt protection and ripped up John Prescott’s 200 pages of politically correct guidance,’ local government minister Brandon Lewis said last night. ‘Councils now have tough new powers to stop unauthorised traveller sites to ensure fair play in the planning system.’","The move has angered residents living near farmland at Chorley, Lancashire .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Surrendered: James Hollingsworth, 59, turned himself in on Wednesday to face criminal charges for the April death of his 20-month-old granddaughter in a hot car . A grandfather from Texas has turned himself in to police in order to face criminal charges for the death of his granddaughter. James Hollingsworth, 59, was released on a $5,000 bond from the North Richland Hills Detention Facility in North Texas. He is believed to have caused the death of his 20-month-old granddaughter by heatstroke last April, by leaving her in a hot car. Police say Hollingsworth called 911 on . April 22nd of this year after his 11-year-old grandson discovered . Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth in her grandfather's car. Hollingsworth was supposed to drop Aurora off at daycare that morning after taking her mother to work, but he forgot and left her in the vehicle until he made the afternoon school run. The baby died in the car with the outside temperature around 84 degrees. 'This . is a tragic event for all those involved and if anything we’d like this . to be a learning lesson to other people, anytime you are responsible . for the safety of a child,' officer Keith Bauman said. Heatstroke:  Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth was found dead in a car seat inside a vehicle on  April 22 . Tragic: Hollingsworth was supposed to drop Aurora off at daycare that morning after taking her mother to work . 'Mr. Hollingsworth dropped off his daughter, returned to his residence and . went inside, forgetting to drop off Aurora at day-care, leaving her . inside his vehicle,' Bauman said. 'It . does not have to be a sweltering day of 100 plus temperatures for it to . be dangerous for a child to be in that vehicle,’ he said. 'We are still investigating,' attorney Lex Johnston of Hurst said. 'We don’t believe it will end up a criminal matter. It was a terrible tragedy for everyone involved.' At 3:30 p.m. that afternoon, . Hollingsworth’s daughter called and asked him to pick up her 11-year-old . son from school because he had missed his bus and was walking home. Hollingsworth found the boy, let him in the car and started driving home, police said. Lessons:  'This is a tragic event for all those involved and if anything we¿d like this to be a learning lesson to other people, anytime you are responsible for the safety of a child,' officer Keith Bauman said . Charges: Aurora's death is still under investigation. Hollingsworth faces a charge of injury to a child by omission . Accidental death: Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth died of heatstroke after being left in a car and her death was ruled an accident . After climbing inside the car, the boy told his grandfather that something was wrong with Aurora. She had died in her car seat. Child Protective Services investigators are looking into the case. Aurora had three older siblings ages 6, 8 and 11. Aurora was the 17th child to die of heatstroke in a car this year. Last year there were 44 such deaths in the U.S. In most cases, the caregiver simply forgot about the child. Studies show that on average, temperatures inside a vehicle can increase rapidly in a relatively short space of time: up to 19 degrees in 10 minutes and 34 degrees in half an hour.","Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth was left in a car for much of the day after her grandfather forgot about her .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . If you often let half-drunk bottles of wine go to waste, there’s a nifty way to save it. A gadget called Winesave protects opened wine by injecting argon, an inert and odourless gas, into the bottle. The gas is heavier than air, so sinks to the surface of the liquid, protecting its taste by providing a ‘perfect and impenetrable seal’. Preservative: The small bottle can preserve up to 100 bottles of wine using layers of the inert gas . Protected: Winesave uses argon, an inert gas which sits on the surface of the wine, to stop it oxidising . Wine usually decays on contact with oxygen in the air, which leads to its sharp, vingerary taste after too long exposes to the elements. It means you’ll never again have to pour oxidised wine down the sink. Simply squirt argon from the Winesave canister and replace the cap or cork. According to the manufacturers, the bottles will keep for weeks after being treated with the gas, which has no effect on the flavour or any other quality of the wine. Each can has enough gas for 100 bottles: £19.95 from winesave.com .","Winesave gizmo pumps heavy gas into bottles, which sits on surface of wine .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Boston police department is being accused of trapping motorists with a fake pedestrian who is actually working undercover for the the cops. In a video uploaded to YouTube, a bystander records footage of a man walking back and forth across an intersection in Somerville, Massachusetts. Massachusetts law states that 'the driver of a vehicle shall yield right of way... to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within a crosswalk.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Trap: The alleged undercover crosswalker steps out onto the crosswalk in front of a stopped vehicle . Back and forth: Upon reaching the other side, he turns around and crosses again . Failure to do so is punishable by a fine of $200. 'Somerville police are using undercover crosswalkers to set up questionable traps at crosswalks throughout the town,' alleges the Free Thought Project. 'The undercover just walks back and forth in the crosswalk all day long, while the unit pulls over the unsuspecting “criminals” to issue a citation.' The video shows a man walking back and forth across the crosswalk, thought to be at the intersection between Washington and Tufts Streets. Not stopping: This car drives through the crosswalk as the pedestrian is walking through it . Hot pursuit: Moments later a police car emerges from around the corner to pull the motorist over for the infringement, which incurs a $200 fine . 'If you don't stop, he'll get ya,' says the voice of the man taking the footage, adding that a police officer had yelled at him for taking the video. Seconds after a motorist fails to stop as the walker begins crossing the intersection, a police car emerges from around a corner with its siren blazing. According to voices on the video, this same ruse had been happening the day before. The video was uploaded to Facebook last Monday and Somerville residents are already taking notice, with messages posted to the Somerville Police Department's Facebook page from residents to be undercover crosswalkers.","A Massachusetts police department has been accused of using a trap to raise revenue .

"By . Jack Doyle . But I never got payment protection insurance... Lack of legal powers means the government's watchdog is unable to tackle spam text marketing firms . Companies that bombard the public with nuisance text messages are getting away with it because ministers are dragging their feet over fining them. Rogue marketing firms send tens of thousands of spam texts every day, but the Government has failed to change the law since a legal ruling seven months ago undermined powers allowing a watchdog to fine them. Since then, Information Commissioner Christopher Graham has not issued a single financial penalty for spam texting. The watchdog has warned the ruling leaves it almost powerless to act. Simon Entwisle, director of operations at the Information Commissioner’s Office, said the organisation was desperate for the law to be changed so ‘we can stop these people who cause such a nuisance to so many people’. There are also fears the ruling could be used by direct marketing firms to resist paying fines for excessive cold calling. However, the Government has not even published plans to change the law. Mr Entwisle said that before the ruling, the ICO had issued nearly £1million of penalties against firms breaking the law. But he warned: ‘The problem we’ve got at the moment is that the law requires us to prove calls or texts are causing substantial harm or substantial distress before we can issue a penalty. ‘We’ve asked the Government to make it easier for us to issue penalties, so that we need to simply prove annoyance or nuisance before acting. That law change would be a game changer. ‘There must be no further delay in strengthening our powers. Nuisance calls are just that – a nuisance – and we believe that should be sufficient to let us consider a fine.’ The ruling came in the case of Christopher Niebel, who escaped a £300,000 fine despite sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited texts about payment protection insurance and accident claims. A tribunal ruled in November that such actions did not meet the legal test requiring ‘substantial harm or substantial distress’ to have been caused for a fine to be issued. Until then, the ICO routinely used electronic communications laws to issue hefty fines against spam marketing firms. At the time of the ruling, the organisation said: ‘If we are prevented from issuing fines, it’s fair to expect the public will receive more of these messages.’ In the past 12 months, it has received 30,324 complaints about spam texts – nearly 600 a week. Nuisance: A graphic from the Information Commissioner's Office illustrates an example of a spam text . The ICO asked for a new law a year ago – even before the ruling. Without the change, it can only use ‘cease and desist’ court orders against firms. Some companies pump out tens of thousands of spam texts a day trawling for responses on PPI, accident payouts and payday loans. Anyone who responds – even by accident – can find their details sold on to other firms, and find themselves inundated with further texts or calls. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: ‘We have increased the fines to up to £2million for companies who breach the law and legislated to allow Ofcom to share information easily with the Information Commissioner’s Office. ‘We will shortly consult on lowering the threshold for when action can be taken against firms making nuisance calls and texts.’ Everyone who uses a smartphone, laptop or tablet computer could face censorship by Brussels under the EU’s new right to be forgotten rule, a House of Lords report warned yesterday. The law – which allows anyone to request for material about them to be taken off the internet – could apply not just to internet giants such as Google but to every individual who uses the internet or social media.

"By . Travelmail . While English people have been voted the best travel companions in Europe by our younger continental neighbours, it is the Germans who have come out top as the most popular on holiday. Researchers found that people from European countries aged between 16 and 24 would prefer to meet English people when travelling more than any other nationality. But overall the Germans were found to be the people other Europeans would most like to meet when on holiday, with 37 per cent of people voting our North European neighbours the people they'd most like to hang out with. Most popular: The Germans have been voted overall as the most popular nationality to meet while on holiday . In . response to the question, 'Who do you like to meet while travelling?' - . with the option for selecting multiple nationalities - the poll found . that the English were voted for by 35 per cent, closely followed by the French (33 per cent), . and Spanish (33 per cent). Least popular were Austrians (24 per cent), Belgians (23 per cent), and Portuguese (19 per cent). The large-scale poll involved people from England, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, France and Spain on their opinions and notions about other nationalities that they encounter in a travelling context. Researchers said one reason why the English are seen as good travel buddies could be because our language is the language of travel. 'English people in general are respectful and well educated; add to that the fact that English is now the international travel language, and you have a great mix for friendliness,' said Robin Wilfert, creative director of GoEuro . Not a single respondent aged between 25 and 34, including Scots themselves, voted for the Scots as best hosts or guests, found the research . The research from GoEuro, a website and app that helps plan travel across the continent, also uncovered who were seen as the best hosts and guests. The poll posed the questions 'Who are the best hosts?' and 'Who are the best guests?' People were allowed to pick one country only, with the majority selecting the Spanish (17 per cent) and Italians (16 per cent) as preferred hosts, while the Germans (16 per cent) were voted the favourite nationality to have as a guest. One in 11 Europeans (nine per cent) voted English people as the best hosts and the same amount said they were the best guests - making them the joint fifth best hosts with the Germans, and the joint sixth best guests with the Italians. Smaller countries tended to receive fewer votes but the researchers said it was in part a consequence of their population sizes - meaning correspondingly limited opportunities for significant interaction on the part of their fellow Europeans. Researchers said the Scottish results were 'emphatic' when subdivided according to age of respondents - they said not a single respondent aged between 25 and 34, including Scots themselves, voted for the Scots as 'best hosts' and no respondents in either the 18 to 24, or 55-64, age categories, including Scots themselves, selected Scots as 'best guests.'

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . Alastair Cook batted on Wednesday as if he didn’t know what all the fuss was about, adding an unbeaten 70 to his first-innings 95 to quieten the debate about the captain’s form. It was just a shame so few people turned up to watch. A crowd of 4,784 at the Ageas Bowl felt more like a county Twenty20 game than the fourth day of a crucial Test. The sun was out, spectators went topless, and ice creams were sold. It was pleasant enough. But for a state-of-the-art venue staging only its second Test, and desperate to host an Ashes match in 2019, it was not a good look. Empty seats: Just 4,784 people attended the fourth day between England and India at the Ageas Bowl . Joy: England have excelled and the Alastair Cook's (left) captaincy has been brilliant but few fans have seen it . Hampshire deserve sympathy. When they bid for a game in this series, they did not know they would be lumbered with the first Sunday start in England in 135 years. This oddity is a consequence of a sardine-like schedule, with five Tests crammed into 42 days. For Hampshire the effect, ironically, has been anti-commercial: corporate boxes are unfillable at weekends. And with the rest of this match played on work days, attendances have fallen away. The county’s chairman Rod Bransgrove, who cut an upbeat figure on Sunday after 15,000 made their way to Southampton - despite problems on the roads and railways - was more subdued on Wednesday, even though the ECB have underwritten potential losses for this game. ‘It’s a massive disappointment, if not totally unexpected,’ he said. ‘We were prepared, because we knew what the ticket sales were going into the match. We did everything humanly possible to market the game, but it is a disappointment to see this sort of crowd at a beautiful sunny ground with a game up for grabs.’ Celebration: England are on the brink of their first Test victory in 11 matches against India in the third Test . Bransgrove was not alone. ‘Shame to see so many empty seats at the Ageas Bowl,’ tweeted former Hampshire star Chris Tremlett. ‘Starting on Sunday is a shame for the club, especially as it’s produced a great Test.’ But there are other factors at play. For all the good work done at the Ageas Bowl over the years, the venue - situated just off the M27 - does not obviously encourage walk-up customers. Then there’s the surprising lack of Indian fans, a worrying echo of the first Test at Trent Bridge. Former batting star Rahul Dravid suggested: ‘It’s a five-Test series with two games in London and one in Manchester. Perhaps places like The Oval and Old Trafford are easier to get to.’ Dravid was still playing when India last toured England three years ago. Then, crowds flocked to see Sachin Tendulkar. Now, Indian fans either feel less connection to MS Dhoni’s young side, or they’re waiting for the one-dayers. Nor is it a coincidence that England under Cook have failed to win any of their last 10 Tests. Whatever the reason, English cricket should be concerned that a Test match played in high summer, and without the distraction of football’s Premier League, has attracted so few spectators. If five-day cricket really is thriving in England, there are times when it has a funny way of showing it. Location: Despite the great cricket, the Ageas Bowl is situated next to the M27 which stops walk-up customers .","Just 4,784 people attended the fourth day of the third Test on Wednesday .

"By . Daniel Martin . Pupils should not worry about their exam results because no one will remember them in years to come, the head of a leading girls’ school has said. Judith Carlisle, headmistress of Oxford High School, said there was no point fretting over GCSEs because no one will ‘give a damn’ about results – and because they don’t  reflect character. She is running a ‘Death of Little Miss Perfect’ initiative at the private school to combat perfectionism in her students. Headmistress Judith Carlisle is telling pupils not to worry about their GCSE results in a bid to wipe out 'perfection' ‘Perfectionism is only captured in a moment – it’s not achievable longer term,’ she said. ‘It undermines self-esteem and then performance. ‘In five years’ time, no one will give a damn which GCSE [grade] you got in French.’ Miss Carlisle said that students don’t always need to aim for 100 per cent, and if they do need an A grade to attend their university of choice, it’s not necessary to get the highest A possible. She said: ‘It matters, but sometimes it probably won’t matter. It’s very important to have an insurance offer [for a university that requires lower grades]. ‘It’s a good discipline to have your contingency plan in place. Don’t aim for Oxford if not getting in will destroy you – or if going will destroy you, but that’s another thing entirely. ‘It’s important [the girls are] not going for things that if they don’t get it, it will destroy them. Exams aren’t who they are – it’s what they did on that day.’ The headmistress, who runs Oxford High, a £13,000-a-year girls' school, . said no-one would 'give a damn' what pupils got in French GCSE later . down the line - and that exams were only 'what (pupils) did on that day' Miss Carlisle is trying to teach her students about the importance of failure, where ‘the real failing is failing to have a go’. She said: ‘There’s unhelpful perfectionism as opposed to high standards. It’s not that we’re aiming to undermine high standards – it will actually help you achieve higher standards. ‘It’s about the principles that every parent wants, that their children grow up as happy as they can be and as robust as we can get them to be, and that they learn more by failing and not getting it right. Unhappy people can’t learn anything anyway.’ Miss Carlisle said her school had brought in a series of methods to teach the girls about perfectionism, such as introducing online tests where it is impossible to get 100 per cent. Mobile phones have been banned from school trips to teach girls to ‘live in the moment’. And lessons on personal health and social education have been dedicated to the topic of perfectionism. ‘We’ve all adopted a shared language as well,’ Miss Carlisle said. ‘We’re stopping them from answering questions by saying “I expect this is wrong but…”. We all say we’re not doing that.’ Pupils are also receiving group cognitive behavioural coaching, where they learn psychological principles of changing the negative voice in their heads.","Judith Carlisle said 'no one will give a damn which GCSE you got in French'

"By . Jane Fryer . The view from Tim and Sheila Wilmot’s bedroom window is, frankly, rather astonishing. Palm trees as high as houses sway in the breeze, 15ft banana trees stand firm, Chinese windmill palms droop with huge clusters of green and purple seeds. There are enormous spiky agave plants, money trees the size of small bears, a 5ft bird of paradise. Scroll down for video . Jeepers creepers! Tim Wilmot, centre, is pictured surrounded by the exotic blooms of his garden in a suburb of Bristol - the product of decades' hard work . The air is sweet and hot and damp. You can hear water tinkling in the distance. All that’s missing is a troop of screaming monkeys swinging from liana to liana and a venomous snake or two. Vast ferns rustle in the shade - is that a tiger breaking cover? No, of course not. Don’t be so silly. Because Tim, 56, and Sheila, 60, don’t actually live anywhere near the Amazon rainforest, deep in the Congo or even in a particularly tropical spot of the Mediterranean. Home is a modern detached house in the sprawling commuter village of Yate, on the outskirts of Bristol, 50 yards from a thundering bypass. Neighbouring gardens boast neatly clipped lawns, conservatories, rose beds and nylon washing lines. But Tim, who runs his own software company, prefers things a bit more tropical. ‘I don’t know why. It’s a good question. I’ve never lived in the tropics. I’ve never lived abroad. I wasn’t even particularly interested in gardening when I was growing up,’ he says. Ready for action: Tim poses above with a pair of garden shears. He spends hours every day tending to his array of plants, which hail from all over the world . Could you guess? From the front Tim Wilmot's home in Yate, not far from Bristol and yards from a thundering bypass - looks like any other home . ‘But 20 or 30 years ago we’d go on summer holidays and I’d spend all my time looking at jelly palms and Canary Island palms and think: “Wow! I’d love one of those in my garden. One day...” ’ The Wilmot family moved in when son Max, now 25, was still a baby, Toby, now 21, wasn’t even a glint in the eye and the garden was, well, just as you’d expect a suburban garden to be. Nice big patio, beech hedge, leylandii, apple trees, decent stretch of grass, a bright orange Ronsealed fence, ornamental pagoda and not a banana tree or shrieking chimpanzee in sight. ‘It was fine for a bit. But no one else in the family is into gardening, so I just sort of started doing my own thing. I didn’t ask permission,’ says Tim. He is a self-taught amateur gardener. But, bit by bit, with the help of gardening books, information from the internet and trial and error, he transformed this quarter of an acre into looking like a painting by Henri Rousseau. Down came the beech hedge and the apple trees and the pagoda. The leylandii were ripped up and replaced with a bamboo plantation. In went jelly palms from South America, banana trees, ferns, ornamental cacti, yuccas, succulents, gunneras (which looks a bit like monster prehistoric spiky rhubarb) and rice paper plants. ‘I had a few tropical plants in our last garden, but they were all in pots and just waiting to be let loose.’ Once unleashed, they must have gone mad. Because today everything is massive, enormous, jungle-sized. The banana leaves are like sails. The foliage of the gunnera measures six foot across. The rice paper plant leaves are the size of coffee tables. Hours' work: Tim spends more than two hours every day watering his garden during dry spells - and has luckily never been hit by a hose-pipe ban . Despite his modesty, maintaining a jungle garden on the outskirts of Bristol isn’t simply a combination of gentle pruning and swinging like Tarzan through the foliage. ‘It’d be easier in London or down in the South-West - we’re in a frost pocket here.’ So during winter, Tim spends hours hunched over his own weather station checking for cold snaps and high winds, erecting vast home-made polytunnels made of curved drainpipes and polythene over his prized agaves (from sunny Mexico) and lovingly wrapping his tender palms and bananas in horticultural fleece. ‘I get very twitchy when it’s cold. I’ll be out there at three in the morning in my dressing gown, putting extra layers of fleece on.’ He also spreads ten bales of straw round the bases of the banana plants, builds plant shelters and decants the pot plants into a purpose-built greenhouse. This sounds a breeze, until you remember that many are 10ft and weigh half-a-ton each. ‘It takes three days with the help of Max to get them all in. They hate the cold, so I have a fan heater going to keep the temperature above three or four degrees.’ Humble roots: Mr Wilmot's gardening ambitions began with a few humble palm trees, but became more audacious over time . Then, come spring, he has to reverse the whole process, hoping and praying no lasting damage has been done. ‘It’s only in the spring you can tell if the palm trees are OK. They’re still green, but the central spear will go mushy and collapse. It’s very sad. ‘I have vision of how it should all look and then I end up with a blank spot in the garden. I’m very critical and I want everything to be perfect.’ Does Sheila get irritated, what with him buzzing in and out all night in his pyjamas, fussing over the palms? ‘Yes. I tend to get a bit engrossed and everything I do in the garden takes twice as long as I tell her it will. ‘But I think she minds more in the summer, when we could be going out for the evening and I’m busy watering.’ And watering, and watering. During a dry spell, he’ll spend at least two hours a night watering. ‘You could put a hose-pipe on a banana all day and they’d lap it up. They could live in water.’ Perfectionist: Tim admits to spending hours more than planed in his garden - and has reached the point where it is so full there is no extra room unless something dies . Happily, the Wilmots’ house was built in 1988, just before water meters were introduced. But what about hose-pipe bans? ‘We’ve never had a hose-pipe ban here, only a sprinkler ban. But I’ve got a well and a pump for emergencies.’ Over the years, there have been disasters - ‘I’ve had terrible losses with my tender palms’ - and triumphs. ‘It’s a very big moment when one of the banana trees produces a banana - you can’t eat them, of course. They’re small and there’s no flesh in them. But the flower! Ah, it’s a Triffid-like flower. It’s very exciting.’ Tim’s garden has won endless prizes, been featured in magazines and BBC TV’s Gardeners’ World and is open to the public every year as part of the National Gardens Scheme (the next open day is Sunday, September 14). And today, finally, after 25 years of hard work, it is finished. ‘It’s done, it’s full. To be honest, it’s a bit of a relief. I can’t fit anything else in, so it’s a one-in-one-out system when something dies.’ And, rude question, but what about the cost of it all? Extensive: Much of the garden, pictured in the height of summer, is packed away in colder months . Exotic: The puya plant, pictured, originally comes from the mountainous Andres, but can survive in Bristol . Vibrant: Mr WIlmot's plants, such as this golden bamboo, are usually found thousands of miles away . ‘People always go on and on about the money, but I don’t think it’s that much - £10,000 altogether. You could spend that on a golf club subscription. It’s a hobby and it’s exercise, so it’s good value for money. And all my family get to enjoy it, too. We even had the sitting room windows made bigger so we could all see it better.’ But what if they ever move? ‘I’ll have to leave the plants behind. Maybe I’d donate some to Kew Gardens for their hot house.’ The garden would not appeal to everyone. Today there’s just teeny scrap of lawn left. Barely space for a washing line. The tropical plants dominates totally and utterly. But it is magnificent. The views from the house are extraordinary. Sit on their sofa and it really feels as if you’re in a jungle. The only thing missing is colour. ‘There’s loads of colour! It’s all colour!’ he says, outraged. But it’s all green. What about flowers? A rose or two or clematis? Tim shudders. ‘I see no attraction in roses or clematis. None whatsoever. They get diseases, they need lots of attention and everyone else is growing them. What’s the point?’ And what about the neighbours? ‘They don’t seem to be that into gardening. But I have noticed the odd bamboo springing up. And more palm trees. ‘Maybe it’ll catch on and in 30 years this whole area will be one big jungle.’","Tim Wilmot, a software developer from Yate, near Bristol, has been working on his lush paradise for 25 years .

"By . Richard Arrowsmith . The Detroit Tigers became the first baseball team to have three pitchers who have all won the coveted Cy Young Award after completing a blockbuster deadline day deal for David Price from Tampa Bay on Thursday. Price joins Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander to complete the Tigers' collection of successive Cy Young award winners over the last three seasons. The AL Central-leading Tigers are aiming for a fourth consecutive division title and now have one of the strongest set of pitchers to help reach that goal. Pitching in: David Price has joined the Detroit Tigers from the Tampa Bay Rays . Hat-trick! Tigers now boast the last three Cy Award winners with Justin Verlander (L) and Max Scherzer (R) General manager Dave Dombrowski told the Associated Press: 'The question that we asked ourselves is: What gives us the best chance of winning the world championship this year? 'We thought adding him to our rotation at this point would give us the best chance to do that.'' 'Today it’s great. I love to have David Price. If we win, then I’ll be very satisfied,' he added. Price reacted onn Twitter: 'Wow...what a day!! Rays fans THANK YOU!! Great Chapter of my life just ended … ready to start a new one with the Tigers!! Thanks again.' Price's move came after Tampa slipped well behind in the AL East race earlier this season and, despite coming into form over the last month, the Rays decided to cash in on their star. The deal also involved the Seattle Mariners, who took Austin Jackson from Detroit while Tigers pitcher Drew Smyly and Mariners infielder Nick Franklin were sent to the Rays. A minor-league shortstop, Willy Adames, also swapped the Tigers for the Rays. Speculate to accumulate: Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski is aiming for a fourth title . 'Compared to the other possibilities, it was by far the most prudent thing that we could do for the best interests of the franchise,” said Andrew Friedman, Tampa Bay’s vice-president of baseball operations. 'If you look ahead to next year, it would have been really challenging to be as good as we want to be within our situation, with David taking up that meaningful of a percentage of our payroll. So everything we do is in the vein of how to be competitive in the near term and also the long term.' The Tigers will use Price in rotation with Verlander, Scherzer, Anibal Sanchez and Rick Porcello. Price, 28, leads the American League in innings and strikeouts. He is seventh in the league in WHIP. He is third in strikeouts per walk and fifth in strikeouts per nine innings.","Detroit Tigers have signed David Price from Tampa Bay Rays .

"By . James Slack . More than 1,000 convicts who are considered a risk to the public and should be behind bars are unlawfully walking Britain’s streets – including 21 killers and 15 rapists. The shocking figure emerged in a blizzard of reports from the Ministry of Justice which critics said showed a justice system in ‘crisis’. Other revelations included the Government failing in its promise to boot out foreign prisoners, a doubling in the number of Muslim inmates over the past decade and sharp rise in the number of criminals absconding from jail. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling insists escapes from prison are 'still incredibly rare' There was also a record number of violent attacks on prison officers – who are now forced to wear slash-proof vests and body cameras. The bundle of reports showed how 1,030 criminals who had been recalled to custody for breaching the terms of their release – by, for example, harassing their previous victim - remain unlawfully at large. Those who managed to go-on-the-run before being found and returned to custody include 17 murderers, four people guilty of manslaughter, 14 rapists, two paedophiles and a further 21 sex attackers. The total number of offenders at large in this way increased by 23 last year. There was also an alarming rise in the number going missing from jail – which rose to 225, up almost 30 per cent over the past two years. This included 137 from open prisons, which have been the subject of controversy after a spate of criminals walked out. The most high-profile was Michael Wheatley - known as the ‘Skullcracker’ - who sparked a nationwide manhunt after absconding from HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. Union leaders claimed the wrong people were being sent to open jails because of the huge pressure on the system. Michael Wheatley - known as the ‘Skullcracker’ - who sparked a nationwide manhunt after absconding from HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent . In the past year, the total prison population has increased by around 2,000 to a record 85,509. One reason is that, despite repeated promises by David Cameron to kick-out foreign criminals, the numbers remain stubbornly high. Figures released yesterday showed there are 10,834 overseas convicts clogging up our jails, up from 10,786 last year. Other data published by the MoJ showed: . Glyn Travis, of the Prison Officers’ Association, claimed the prisons service is ‘in crisis’. He said: ‘The prison population is increasing and despite changes introduced by the Ministry of Justice we still believe that inappropriate prisoners are being sent to open conditions as the service tries to manage its available cellular accommodation. ‘The prison service recently crowded more prisons and despite this action, which endangers public safety and prisons, the problem continues to escalate.’ Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ‘Prisons are becoming places of extreme violence as men are caged with nothing to do all day, and in some terrible cases they have become death traps.’ Yesterday, it emerged part of a prison officer’s ear has been bitten off in an attack at Nottingham Prison . Officials pointed to positive news in the report, with reoffending rates falling slightly. Some 1,155 prisoners deemed as 'low risk' have worked outside of prison on temporary licences, earning a total of more than £3.6 million - an increase of almost £1 million compared to 2012/13. The MoJ took around £1million of the money to provide help to victims. In a statement, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘As with any significant period of change – coupled with prison population increases higher than expected – it has been a challenge. 'We are responding to and managing the additional pressures but prisons are still running safe and decent regimes.’ He added: ‘Absconds have seen a slight increase this year but are still more than 80 per cent lower than they were a decade ago, and temporary release failures remain below 0.1 oer cent. Escapes are still incredibly rare. ‘The prison population has increased higher than expected. This is due to an increase in remands being held in custody and convicted sex offenders – 680 over the last twelve months. ‘We will always have enough prison places for those sent to us by the courts and we have taken sensible measures to create temporary accommodation until our new houseblocks open later this year.'","1,000 people considered a risk to the public 'unlawfully walking the streets'

"By . Sam Dunn Deputy Editor, Money Mail . A damning official report has laid bare how tax officials are wrongly rejecting thousands of complaints about bills. The independent tax watchdog is finding in favour of nine in ten people whose case it investigates, it has emerged. All of these will have first endured months of fighting HM Revenue & Customs before being allowed to take their case to the Tax Adjudicator. The independent tax watchdog is finding in favour of nine in ten people whose case it investigates, it has emerged . The report also warns that customers who are forced to use the internet to pursue complaints risk getting a raw deal. In many instances, the victims are vulnerable pensioners on low fixed incomes forced to spend months fighting officials before being told they will not have to pay. Over the 12 months to March 31, the adjudicator received 12,074 inquiries from the public about shabby treatment at the hands of HMRC. It resolved 2,311 complaints – nearly double the number last year. Of these, 2,073 went in favour, or partly in favour, of the consumer. The adjudicator ordered HMRC to pay out £246,000 for poor complaints handling and causing worry and stress. Nearly £4million of tax was written off. Robin Williamson, director of the charity Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, described the figures as ‘shocking’. ‘The people that take their case to the adjudicator have already hung on and gone after HMRC with a complaint and stuck to their guns all the way through,’ he said. ‘Many will have given up or not known they can complain.’ HMRC, which has its headquarters at 100 Parliament Street in London, was ordered to pay out £246,000 for poor complaints handling and causing worry and stress. Nearly £4million of tax was written off . Many complaints are initially rejected by officials and taxpayers need to use a little-known rule – called an Extra-Statutory Concession – to attempt get the bill written off. If this is again rejected they have little option but to take their case to the independent adjudicator. This whole process can take months. Adjudicator Judy Clements said some tax staff were in danger of ‘being left behind in their understanding of complaints and customer service’ and showed ‘no sense of urgency when making decisions on customer issues’. She also added: ‘I am disappointed to see HMRC staff still overlooking the needs of some vulnerable customers.’ As HMRC has put more information online and shut its walk-in inquiry centres, it has been accused of failing to support taxpayers who don’t have access to the internet or have problems understanding complex tax forms. The adjudicator’s report is a vindication of Money Mail’s fight to expose the scandal of pensioners unjustly hit with tax bills. It comes as HMRC is under fire for plans to seize cash directly from the bank accounts or savings of people accused of not paying tax. A spokesman for HMRC said it had ‘worked hard’ to improve how complaints were handled. ‘We expect the adjudicator to uphold fewer complaints this year as our improved procedures were then in place,’ said the spokesman.","Tax watchdog finds in favour of nine in ten people whose case it investigates .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . John Bercow faces being ousted as Commons Speaker by an anonymous letter writing campaign in Parliament. A Commons motion has been drafted condemning his ‘increasingly erratic behaviour’ and accusing him of failing to ‘live up to the tradition of impartiality’ of his predecessors. The one-page letter, seen by MailOnline, has been circulated in Parliament in an attempt to step up pressure on the 51-year-old to quit. A Commons motion has been drafted accusing John Bercow of failing to ‘live up to the tradition of impartiality’ of his predecessors, and demanding an immediate search for a replacement . The anonymous letter is thought to have been sent to several MPs and journalists in Parliament . Criticism of Mr Bercow has mounted in recent weeks, after he has appeared to repeatedly mock David Cameron in the Commons and faced accusations of being rude to staff. Aides to the Speaker were forced to deny he told outgoing Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers to ‘f*** off’. One of the most bizarre exchanges came this week, as Mr Cameron took questions during a lengthy sessions on Gaza and the Malaysian Airlines MH17 atrocity. Mr Bercow interrupted proceedings to say: ‘Somebody asked how long the statement would run, but I would just point out, if I may, that there is intense interest in it and that the frequency of the Prime Minister’s tennis playing on the one hand and his jogging regime on the other means that he is quite fit enough, I am sure.’ The incident could have proved to be the final straw for whoever is behind the draft motion calling for Mr Bercow to quit. It also accuses the Speaker of ‘systematic bullying and humiliation of staff’, something Mr Bercow denies. The Early Day Motion criticising Mr Bercow has not been formally tabled, and does not appear to have been signed. It states: ‘This House regrets that the Speaker has failed to live up to the tradition of impartiality established by his predecessors; notes his increasingly erratic behaviour; condemns his systematic bullying and humiliation of staff, which has no place in modern society, and especially not in a Parliament which should set a national example; and therefore resolves to proceed immediately to the election of a new Speaker, in which he shall not be a candidate.’ Tory MP Michael Fabricant last week accused Mr Bercow of telling the Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers to 'f*** off' A similar motion was used by Tory MP Douglas Carswell to help to unseat the last Speaker, Labour MP Michael Martin, in June 2009. Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who denies being behind the letter, said at the weekend: ‘Parliament deserves better than hot-headed, unpredictable and foul-mouthed John Bercow. ""The sooner we get a new Speaker, the better. Bercow should go,’ he wrote in the Mail on Sunday. It followed his claim in the Commons that Mr Bercow swore at Sir Robert. The Speaker immediately denied the allegation about Sir Robert Rogers, saying: ‘I’ll ignore that last observation which suffered from the disadvantage of being wrong.’ But Mr Fabricant stood by the claim, declaring he does not believe things should be ‘swept under the carpet’. Earlier this year Mr Bercow tried to humiliate Mr Cameron in the Commons by cutting him off mid-sentence. During raucous exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was shouted down by Labour MPs and interrupted by Mr Bercow. As the PM tried to protest that he had not finished, the Speaker hit back: 'He can take it from me that he is finished.' Last year relations reached such a low that MPs designed badges with three bees pictured, to show they were members of the BBB club: ‘Bol****ed By Bercow’.","Letter circulated in Parliament claiming Speaker is not being impartial .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . The head of the Women's Institute today called for all children to be taught cookery at school to help tackle the 'obesity timebomb' and stop them wasting so much food. Ruth Bond, whose organisation has more than 200,000 members, believes compulsory lessons on the national curriculum would prepare pupils for adult life. Her comments come after the WI launched a food security campaign in an attempt to reduce the 15million tonnes of food Britain throws away each year. 'Excellent thing': Head of the Women's Institute Ruth Bond has called for all children to be taught cookery at school to improve their health and stop food wastage . Ministers are also considering whether to force schools to increase culinary teaching. Mrs Bond said the education system had 'fallen down' because cookery lessons were not 'taught widely'. She told MailOnline: 'Good, healthy cooking leads to a healthy lifestyle. It is a holistic approach. We don't want food wasted, but that is an issue in itself. This is a health issue as well. 'If you give children these skills at an early age, it would go some way to tackling the obesity timebomb'. Mrs Bond said lessons should focus on the basics, such as not over-cooking potatoes and how to buy and plan meals. She said the demands of modern life . meant many children were living on a diet of ready meals because their . parents were often too busy to cook. It . would also help if more parents got their children into the kitchen . with them, added Mrs Bond, who admitted she was 'fortunate' to learn . from a mother who taught the subject. Back to basics: Mrs Bond says the education system had 'fallen down' because cookery lessons were no longer taught widely (file picture posed by models) She added that the WI, which has around 210,000 members in 6,500 branches, holds regular home-cooking courses for young parents so they can plan meals at home more effectively. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she said a useful tip would be to adapt recipes from books to include ingredients that need using up. She said: 'It is a case of planning . what you are going to eat, make your list, and look in your cupboard to . see if there is anything that would do.' Mrs . Bond also suggested that best-before dates do not have to be followed . too religiously, especially if the food has not gone mouldy. Getting stuck in: Mrs Bond has also urged parents to encourage their children to help cook at home . The WI has enjoyed a long history of campaigning on behalf of women and their communities . Here's a snapshot of some of the battles they have fought: . The WI's first campaign was on school dinner provision in 1926. In 1943, almost 30 years before the law changed, a resolution from Bures WI in West Suffolk demanding equal pay for equal work was passed at the AGM. In 1954, a resolution against litter was passed which eventually led to the formation of Keep Britain Tidy. In 1964 Hellesdon WI in Norfolk won the support of the AGM on a resolution against smoking in public places. During the 1970s, the WI lobbied for the introduction of breast screening clinics – this resulted in the government introducing a number of mobile screening clinics followed by a national screening programme for all women aged 50 – 64, the first of its kind in the EU. The 80s saw the WI call for public facing information campaigns on HIV and AIDs. More recently the WI has worked to raise awareness on the nature and extent of violence against women, tackled excess packaging and focussed on the plight of the honeybee. Source: WI . A Department for Education spokesman . said: 'Decisions on the subjects to be included in the secondary . National Curriculum will be announced in due course, but nothing will . prevent schools from teaching practical cookery. 'We know that a healthy attitude towards food, developed early, is critical to the health and well-being of young people. 'We . are currently looking at the role food and cooking plays in schools and . how this can help children develop an understanding of food and . nutrition.' The WI was set up during the First World War to encourage women to tighten their belts and make the most of their meagre household budgets. Last month, it was revealed that, due to the recession, record numbers of young women are once again turning to the organisation to learn vital 'make do and mend' skills. In the last three years, 56,500 women have joined the WI, which has a total membership of around 210,000 in England and Wales. The influence of the WI was highlighted in 2007 when Marks & Spencer credited the organisation with turning its fortunes around. Facing falling sales amid accusations that the store had stopped listening to its customers, then chief executive Stuart Rose turned to the WI for help. About 800 WI members in Kent, Buckinghamshire and Leicestershire were invited to form a focus group which would help guide the company. They gave precise guidance on how to improve individual garments - advice which the store said has helped it improve its profits. It even credited members for doubling the order of a fluted printed skirt on sale in some stores the previous year. The women gave the nod of approval to several items which went on to become hits, including last season's checked waterfallfront jacket, modelled by Twiggy in advertisements. The organisation was created in 1915 and is preparing for its centenary in 2015.","Head of organisation Ruth Bond says education system has 'fallen down'

"By . Sam Peters . Moeen Ali’s Gaza protest provoked a double-edged backlash on Tuesday. The England all-rounder wore wristbands saying ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ while batting on Monday in the third Investec Test. He was warned on Tuesday not to wear them again by the International Cricket Council — despite the ECB believing he had breached no protocols. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Stuart Broad discusses team-mate Moeen Ali . Statement: Moeen Ali batted for England against India wearing wristbands that read 'Save Gaza' and 'Free Palestine' However, there was a growing feeling on Tuesday night that fellow Muslim cricketers were ready to defy the authorities by playing in similar wristbands. Former Pakistan all-rounder Azhar Mahmood vowed to wear a similar band when he plays for Surrey in their T20 Blast quarter-final against Worcestershire on Saturday at The Oval. Moeen’s cousin Kabir Ali, who played 14  one-day internationals and a Test for England between 2003 and 2006, described the ICC’s decision to sanction Moeen as an ‘absolute joke’. Moeen — a devout Muslim who wears a beard as a mark of his faith — enjoyed a good day in the field, taking two key wickets as England reduced India to 323 for eight. Others had less sympathy for Ali, who received a stinging rebuke from former England bowler Steve Harmison for making a political statement while representing his country.

He has been a bit silly and naive. ‘If he wants to do it away from the field, that’s fine, nobody has any problems with that. To do it on the field is a dangerous thing to do.’ An ICC spokesman said: ‘The regulations do not permit the display of messages that relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes during an international match. ‘Moeen is not permitted to wear the wristbands on the field of play in an international.’","Ali wore black and white wristbands while batting in England's first innings of third Test at Ageas Bowl .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Two men belonging to a ‘witches’ coven’ wore ceremonial robes and used daggers as part of ritualistic sex abuse on young girls, a court has heard. Peter Petrauske, 72, and Jack Kemp, 69, are said to have been involved in a pagan group of ‘white witches’ operating in Cornwall since the 1970s. The alleged abuse, spanning three decades, involved knives and melting wax, Truro Crown Court heard. Accused: Peter Petrauske, pictured, faces three charges of indecent assault and one of rape . Victims claimed they were plied with alcohol before being made to undress in front of a crowd of men wearing robes. They were then allegedly abused by their tormentors, before being given money and sweets to buy their silence. Prosecutor Jason Beal said some of the assaults took the form of rituals, with the victims being made to strip before having their wrists tied. One victim told police of naked children being forced to dance around ‘like models’ for the adults who were all dressed in robes. She claimed she was tied to a chair and blindfolded, and on another occasion her wrists were bound and a ceremonial dagger was drawn over her body. Mr Beal said: ‘She was taken to a house where pagans were present, Jack Kemp was present and “German Pete” (Petrauske) was also there. ‘She was given alcohol, told to dance in front of the camera, and take her clothes off.’ He said the male white witches then exposed themselves and made an indecent proposition. ‘She was given £5 and a bag of sweets,’ Mr Beal added. Hearing: The trial of the two men at Truro crown court is expected to last four weeks . Another witness, said Mr Beal, spoke of Petrauske being ‘really into witchcraft’ and claimed that he would refer to himself as a chief or lord. Petrauake allegedly told police that he was a ‘white witch, a pagan and not a Christian’ and ‘the high priest of a white witch coven’. Detectives discovered daggers, a whip, candles, incense and lavender at his home, the court heard. The historic abuse was only investigated by police last year when Kemp was arrested in connection with another incident, causing rumours to spread around his home town of Falmouth and prompting the alleged victims to contact detectives. The abuse charges cover three decades from the late 1970s to 2009. Kemp faces 15 charges of sexual assaults on youngsters aged between three and 15, while Petrauske, also from Falmouth, faces three charges of indecent assault and one of rape. The trial of both men is due to last around four weeks.

"By . Mark Staniforth, Press Association . Belfast boxer Paddy Barnes believes the sport's world governing body will vote to bring back headguards after a Commonwealth Games campaign marred by a series of high-profile cuts. Barnes breezed into his second consecutive light-flyweight final with a unanimous decision win over Uganda's Fazil Kaggwa. But earlier in the day he watched his friend Michael Conlan scrape through against Welshman Sean McGoldrick on a technical decision after sustaining a bad cut over his right eye from an accidental headbutt. Safety: Northern Ireland's Paddy Barnes (pictured) believes that helmets will have to be brought back to the sport by the authorities . Dangerous: Several boxers, including Michael Conlan (left), have suffered vicious cuts without helmets . And Northern Ireland lightweight Joe Fitzpatrick also required treatment to a gash beneath his left eye after a straightforward win over Michael Alexander of Trinidad. Conlan in particular now faces a race against time to be fit for Saturday's bantamweight final against England's Qais Ashfaq, and Barnes believes a U-turn on the decision is inevitable. Barnes said: 'I think headguards will be back. It's great to see them off because it's better to watch, but it's impossible to fight so many times in so few days without headguards on - it's ridiculous.' Conlan, who also suffered a cut to the top of his head in his first round win over Matthew Martin, is convinced he will be able to compete in the final. 'I felt the cut straight away but it was cleaned up well by the doctor and I will be in the ring tomorrow,' Conlan said. 'I've never been cut on the face or the head in my life until this tournament so it's a bit unfortunate, but I've had it glued and it will be okay. 'I was happy with the way I boxed before it was stopped and I am just happy to be in the final. Tomorrow is going to be a golden day.' Arms aloft: Joe Fitzpatrick (left) also suffered cuts in his bout before prevailing, again heightening safety worries . The 19-year-old Fitzpatrick produced another composed performance to see off Alexander and book a final against Scotland's Charlie Flynn. Fitzpatrick said: 'I'm young but it doesn't mean anything. Paddy and Michael have helped me big time and you will see the best from me on Saturday night.' Michaela Walsh moved through to face Olympic champion Nicola Adams in the women's flyweight final. The Belfast 21-year-old came through against tough Indian Pinki Rani, edging the final two rounds with her cleaner, counter-punching style in order to make sure on the scorecards. Walsh said: 'Months ago I said my dream was to fight Nicola Adams in the Commonwealth final and when I go to bed tonight I will dream of that gold medal hanging round my neck. 'I know if I perform to the best of my ability I can beat her. She is the golden girl and I'm only a baby but in the ring it's a different story.' Northern Ireland light-welterweight Sean Duffy was outpointed by Junias Jonas and light-heavyweight Sean McGlinchy also lost on points to David Nyika of New Zealand. Welterweight Steven Donnelly looked unlucky to drop a split decision to Mandeep Jangra of India, and middleweight Connor Coyle was beaten by India's Vijender (crrct) at middleweight. Alannah Audley-Murphy was outpointed by Australia's Shelley Watts in the women's lightweight division, leaving Northern Ireland with four finalists and five definite bronze medals.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nick Clegg last night condemned the ‘frankly absurd’ idea of it being only mothers who stay at home to look after children, as he vowed to make it easier for new father’s to take time off. The Lib Dem leader, bruised by a raft of allegations that his party ignored complaints of sexual harassment by Lord Rennard, sought to present himself as a champion of women’s rights. In a speech to open the Lib Dem spring conference in Brighton, he attacked the culture of ‘old boy’s clubs’ and said that women still face ‘glass ceilings everywhere they look’. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured arriving in Brighton, told delegates at the party's spring conference that serious failings had been made in the handling of harassment claims . Arriving in Brighton, Mr Clegg denied his party was in crisis, insisting: 'We're in good spirits.' But his optimism contrasted with a warning from the party's president Tim Farron that the the Lib Dems are in a 'critical state'. Mr Farron also branded the party a 'bunch of nutters' and 'cockroaches' and warned: 'One day someone will stand on us if we are not careful. Business Secretary Vince Cable is also preparing to use the conference to repeat his call this week for the government to consider increasing borrowing to spend on infrastructure. In his speech to a party rally last night, Mr Clegg boasted that changes to parental leave – allowing new mothers and fathers to share up to a year in time off work – would create a ‘level playing field’ between men and women. But he admitted that his party’s reputation has been rocked by groping allegations against former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard. He told activists in Brighton that the party had to take ‘a long, hard look in the mirror’ and realise it had ‘let people down’. Mr Clegg was forced to use an address on International Women#s Day to tackle claims the party bungled the handling of groping claims against Lord Rennard . Business Secretary Vince Cable will step up his call for extra investment in infrastructure to get the economy moving . But he admitted that the Lib Dems had ‘no excuse for failing to live up to the highest standards in the treatment of women’. At least 10 women had made allegations against former chief executive Lord Rennard, which he strenuously denies. Mr Clegg said he would not comment on the specific claims which are being investigated by two party inquires and the police. But he told delegates: ‘It is right that – following the events of recent weeks – we take a long, hard look in the mirror.’ In the speech, to mark International Women’s Day, he said the women involved ‘feel let down’. ‘They deserved to have their concerns and allegations examined thoroughly and properly dealt with. But clearly, that has not always been the case. ‘For a party that cherishes equality and women’s rights, we have no excuse for failing to live up to the highest standards in the treatment of women. The standards we – rightly – expect of others. ‘I joined this party because I believe in empowerment; freedom; dignity. I believe that, where an individual feels that they have been badly treated, or that power has been abused, they must have confidence that those concerns will be properly addressed.’ Mr Clegg said he was ‘proud’ of the work the Lib Dems had done in government to ‘level the playing field’ thought shared parental leave and flexible working. Liberal Democrats today appointed a prominent female City figure to lead the independent inquiry into the party's culture and handling of complaints, launched in the wake of the allegations against Lord Rennard. Helena Morrissey's review will look at attitudes towards women in the party, as well as the employment relationship between staff, elected officials and volunteers, training, and how to lead a wider change in Westminster. Ms Morrissey, the chief executive of Newton Investment Management, is the founder of the Thirty Per Cent Club, which campaigns to increase the proportion of women in company boardrooms. She said today that those at the top of politics should 'lead by example' in tackling the old boys' networks which still exclude women from many parts of society. The Morrissey review is separate from a disciplinary inquiry into allegations by a number of women of sexual harassment against Lord Rennard, which the Lib Dem peer strenuously denies. Under the plans New mums and dads will . be able to ‘mix and match’ how they look after a newborn baby for their . first year. They will be able to take up a total of 52 weeks in joint . leave, either taking it in turns or at the same time. But . it risks creating an organisational nightmare for employers, who will . not be able to refuse requests to take off but can turn block the . pattern of leave, if parents want to take time off in different chunks. Mr Clegg said too often new parents base decisions about which parents stays at home on money. ‘It’s an equation where the answer is so often rigged because, whichever way you look at it, the solution ends up being the mother doing more of the caring, and the father doing more of the earning – even if that isn’t what the young couple wants. ‘She gets the year-long maternity leave; after that, the expectation is she’ll continue to be the primary carer – so she’s the one who goes part-time. Lower pay, fewer shots at promotion. Work less, earn less. ‘It’s heartbreaking to watch women who . feel forced to lower their ambitions for themselves. And it’s . heartbreaking to see fathers missing out on being with their children. ‘As . a father, I find the outdated assumption that men should go out and . work and women should stay at home and look after the children frankly . absurd.’ Nutter: Lib Dem president Tim Farron warned the party was in a 'critical state' and future survival could not be guaranteed . Mr Clegg also criticised his own party’s failure to elect more women, after some of the allegations against Lord Rennard centred on his role in choosing female candidates for safe seats. He attacked Westminster as an ‘old boy’s club’, complaining that both the Commons and the Lords are ‘stuffed full of hundreds and hundreds of men and precious few women’. ‘Too often, barriers are put in front of talented and committed women to stop them progressing. It’s a male world, made by men for men, occupied for centuries by men and designed to work to the advantage of men. ‘And Westminster is far from the only boy’s club in our country.’ He criticised the legal system, business and the media for being too male dominated. Mr Cable has questioned whether whether the Government should ¿borrow more, at very low interest rates, in order to finance more capital spending . Senior Lib Dems will use the spring conference to distance themselves from the Tory party. Nick Clegg is expected to use his keynote speech to target both Conservatives and Labour, in an attempt to bolster support for his party after slumping in the polls. Business Secretary Vince Cable will also step up his calls for borrowing to be increased to fund infrastructure spending, despite being slapped down by David Cameron yesterday. The Prime Minister insisted there s no 'magic money tree' to fund big money projects. But Mr Cable will again say capital spending, funded by borrowing, may be needed to kick-start growth. He will repeat his call, in the New Statesman magazine this week, that the Government’s decision to stick to Labour’s plan to cut capital spending was a mistake which had ‘economic consequences’. Mr Cable said there was now a legitimate debate about whether the Government should ‘borrow more, at very low interest rates, in order to finance more capital spending - building of schools and colleges, small road and rail projects, more prudential borrowing by councils for house building.’ He told the magazine that the strategy ‘does not undermine the central objective of reducing the structural deficit, and may assist it by reviving growth’.","Lib Dem leader admits party has to take a 'hard look in the mirror' over handling of groping claims .

"By . Talal Musa . Published: . 13:14 EST, 2 July 2013 . | . Updated: . 16:04 EST, 2 July 2013 . Rating: . Price: £39 / $59 (RRP) Deadpool is a fantastic character trapped in an average game. And no matter how many times he sends the fourth wall crashing down, repetitive, uninspired gameplay stops the title from fulfilling its potential. There’s no denying that High Moon Studios (behind the respectable Transformers: Fall Of Cyberton) have done Marvel’s ‘Merc with a mouth’ justice. Likeable: There's no faulting High Moon's efforts in bringing Deadpool to life, however gameplay is very dull . The disfigured and mentally unstable anti-hero’s screen presence is infectious from the outset – helped by Uncharted actor Nolan North’s efforts. Crude, vulgar, frequently offensive and packed with one-liners, North illustrates Deadpool’s volatile unpredictability with aplomb (bar the odd tasteless gaffe). It’s no surprise, then, that parts when he’s allowed to take centre stage (or share it with some welcome X-Men) are the game’s highlights. Sadly, it’s when Deadpool plays second fiddle to the bread and butter gameplay that cracks start to appear. Most levels – although featuring some ingenious Deadpool-orchestrated mini-sections – involve running through linear levels taking out as many baddies as possible. Gameplay is wafer thin – propped up with a simple upgrade system that isn’t as enjoyable as it could have been. Upgrading weapons, for example, sounds good in theory but shooting is so clunky you’ll be sticking to Deadpool's blades for the most part. Sadly, Deadpool’s hand-to-hand repertoire soon becomes as repetitive as his one-liners, with most combos following the ‘hit, teleport, hit’ pattern. Chances to show off his creative stealth kills are few and far between, too. Graphically, it’s hit and miss. Levels are drab and lack detail, enemies all look the same and Deadpool’s animation is inconsistent. Far from a blast: There are plenty of weapons available but most of the time you'll stick to melee moves . Still, cutscenes are well-realised, while comic-book-style movies that give you certain characters’ backstories, will please hardcore fans. Deadpool proudly boasts that this is ‘HIS’ game. It’s ironic then that such an interesting, zany and unpredictable character has delivered such a run-of-the-mill hack and slash bore. Deadpool is out now.

"By . Paul Harris . The Duchess of Cambridge’s uncle was accused of ‘betrayal’ last night after revealing intimate details about Kate’s personal life, her romance with Prince William and their holidays at his Spanish villa. Gary Goldsmith, 47, cashed in on his royal connections by giving a major interview to Hello! magazine about ‘The Kate I Know’ and the early days of her relationship with William. The Hello! deal was negotiated by Goldsmith’s agent and both the interview and photoshoot took place at his Ibiza villa,which is on the market for £6million. Revealing all: Kate's Uncle, Gary Goldsmith, has spoken to Hello! magazine about his family . Hideaway: The colourfully-named Ibiza villa La Maison de Bang Bang where Kate and William visited Uncle Gary . Goldsmith also paints a picture of a lovelorn Kate pacing around the pool during her brief break-up with William. This is the first time a close member of the Middleton family has spoken in such detail about our future queen. Interview: It is not known how much Mr Goldsmith was paid to speak to Hello! magazine . Over 16 pages, he tells how the young . couple enjoyed mud baths on the island, William’s stint DJing for the . family and how Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, told him not to worry . about the bad publicity he had attracted for the family before the royal . wedding. In an embarrassing breach of protocol, . the interview also reveals how Kate and William  shared a room seven . years ago during a break at the villa, dubiously named La Maison de Bang . Bang. The tattooed tycoon, Carole . Middleton’s brother, is understood to have been paid for the interview, . although neither the magazine nor his agent would discuss whether or how . much Goldsmith was paid. There is no doubt, however, that the publicity will be invaluable in increasing the profile of the villa he is trying to sell. The pictures show several rooms in the . house –  plus shots of Goldsmith reclining on a bed with family album . snaps, some of which are reproduced with the article. Another shows him . on a gold ‘throne’ beside his 11-year-old daughter Tallulah. He also confirms he is planning a book  about ‘his experiences at the heart of the Middleton clan’. Goldsmith, once caught on camera . snorting cocaine and advising an undercover reporter how to meet . Brazilian prostitutes, also tells the magazine of a private conversation . he had with the Duchess of Cornwall at the royal wedding reception in . Buckingham Palace. He apologised to Camilla for the ‘bad . press’ he created and said  she told him: ‘Don’t think twice about it.’ Last night royal commentators accused Goldsmith of ‘betrayal’ and . ‘capitalising on family relationships’. Former Buckingham Palace . spokesman Dickie Arbiter told the Mail: ‘He has sold the family out. He . added: ‘He’s cooked his goose on this one.’ Majesty magazine editor-in-chief . Ingrid Seward said: ‘He either doesn’t care or the enormity of his niece . and sister’s position has passed him by.’ ‘Uncle G’, as the Middleton . siblings apparently describe him, is said to have given the interview . ‘to set the record straight’ after adverse publicity in the run-up to . the royal wedding in 2011 about his ‘wayward’ activities. Perfect couple: Gary said he had 'never seen smiles like it' at Kate and William's wedding . Family ties: The 47-year-old is Carole Middleton's younger brother and godfather to their son, James. The family are pictured leaving the Goring Hotel the morning after Kate and Williams' wedding . Recently it emerged he was living with . a convicted fraudster who once made off with £250,000. Julie-Ann Brown, . whom he married last year, shared his £1.5million mews house in London . after being spared jail by a judge. It is unclear if Kate’s mother Carole . Middleton and her father Michael were fully aware of the article before . it was published but they clearly did not stop it. Goldsmith even gives a plug to their . Party Pieces company, and claims credit for the idea that the business . should expand online. Perhaps significantly he adds: ‘I love all things . marketing and how to present a brand.’ Goldsmith’s agent described as . ‘nonsense’ any suggestion he was effectively using pictures and detail . about Kate and Bang Bang to help sell the villa. Asked if the Duchess had been aware of . the interview or was consulted, a St James’s Palace spokesman said: ‘We . are not commenting on the grounds that we wouldn’t comment on private . conversations between members of the Middleton family.’ Mr Goldsmith attending the Royal Wedding in April 2011: He said he gave James Middleton advice on his reading during the service .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Dundee United wonderkid Ryan Gauld has clinched a sensational £3million move to European giants Sporting Lisbon on a six-year contract. The 18-year-old jetted into the Portuguese capital on Tuesday with his agent, John Colquhoun, his dad and the United secretary John Taylor to finalise his dream switch to the Primeira Liga runners-up. Gauld was undergoing a medical late on Tuesday night after agreeing personal terms on a contract that would run until 2020, as Sporting aimed to rush through the deal in time for their celebrations to mark the club’s 108th anniversary. On the move: Ryan Gauld is on his way to Sporting Lisbon . And, despite a few legal formalities still to be tied up, senior sources close to the move confirmed to Sportsmail that it was ‘essentially a done deal’. It represents a stunning move for Gauld who, at the end of his breakthrough campaign in Scottish football, will now find himself playing in the Champions League with Sporting Lisbon next season. The wide midfielder burst to prominence as a young and exciting United side finished fourth in last season’s Scottish Premiership and reached the Scottish Cup Final, only to lose 2-0 to St Johnstone. His form led to scouts from European powerhouses like Real Madrid, Roma, Manchester United and Arsenal beating a path to Tannadice to watch the talented teenager in the flesh. It also led United to shrewdly tie down their Scotland Under-21 star, who made 42 first-team appearances since his debut in 2012, by securing him on improved terms until 2016. His profile was also substantially raised by his team-mates nicknaming him ‘Baby Messi’, due to the similarity in style and build to Argentina and Barcelona star Lionel Messi. Twiner: Gauld takes on three Celtic players during the Scottish Cup semi-final in April . Joy: He made 50 appearances for the club in all competitions scoring nine goals . VIDEO Gauld scores a brace for Dundee United . On Tuesday, United boss Jackie McNamara had spoken of his desire to keep Gauld at Tannadice to build on last season’s achievements. But he admitted the teenage midfielder’s departure from Tayside was inevitable after a ‘life-changing’ bid was received from the club that honed the talents of Real Madrid’s Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo. ‘There comes a time when a bid is too good to turn down, not just financially but for the player himself,’ said McNamara, speaking before the deal was tied up. ‘If it’s the right club, it could be life changing. ‘The initial offer was good enough for us to let Ryan go and speak to them. We’ ll just need to see what happens over the next 24 hours. ‘I wouldn’t be disappointed if he doesn’t go. Looking at it selfishly from a Dundee United point of view, we’d want him to stay and play for us next season. ‘But, professionally, having been a player myself, you always want people to get a good opportunity. So there are two sides to it. ‘We have said all along that we know the talent we have with Ryan and others. So we’ve known that one day people would come in for them. It was inevitable it would happen.’","Gauld clinches £3million move to Sporting Lisbon on a six-year deal .

Sparks are virtually guaranteed to fly in an explosive Anglo-Scottish grudge match in the badminton mixed doubles semi-final on Saturday when England’s Chris Adcock, 25, and wife Gabby, 23, take on Scotland’s Robert Blair, 32, and Imogen Bankier, 26, against a backdrop of bitter past rivalry. Both of the men involved have previously played mixed doubles with each of the women they oppose on Saturday but Adcock and Bankier’s former alliance was a source of particular negativity in the run-up to the London Olympics. Adcock, 25, was romantically involved with then-girlfriend Gabby (nee White) at that time, but it was deemed Gabby was not good enough on the court to partner him at London 2012. Bitter: Chris Adcock (right) and his wife Gabby Adcock (left) have reached the semi-finals of the mixed doubles . Rivals: Scots Robert Blair (left) and Imogen Bankier (right) will contest the mixed doubles semi-final . Hence she was ‘dumped’, in a sporting sense, and replaced by Bankier. Bankier was on the end of all manner of insults. White called her ‘sour’ via Twitter. White’s close friend and fellow player Jenny Wallwork also used the social network to brand Bankier a ‘cripple’ who should ‘jog on back to Scotland.’ One insider said at the time: ‘It got to a point where Chris and Gabby were not really progressing (on court) — so Chris was paired up with Imogen.’ The verbal spats were partially cleared with ‘it was banter’ apologies. But the situation hardly improved as Adcock and Bankier flopped at London 2012, losing all three group matches to crash out at the first hurdle. White did not even play at the Games. Bankier had been brought into the Badminton England set-up, which controls Team GB badminton, to play with Adcock but then quit to return to Scotland. Joy: The Adcocks celebrate victory in their mixed doubles quarter-final match at the Emirates Arena . Blair and Bankier reached today’s semi-final with a 21-11, 21-17 win over Canada’s Derrick Ng and Phyllis Chan. The Adcocks, who married last year, won 21-13, 21-14 against Singapore’s Lei Yao and Chayut Triyachart. Blair, who knows Gabby Adcock through a time playing mixed together, said last night: ‘I think when you come into tight situations there are a lot of emotions, and sometimes personal emotions come into it as well. ‘People can get quite carried away or excited, and maybe not fight enough, but we are all experienced players now. I am sure we can all deal with the situation and have a good game.’ Bankier said: ‘It is difficult not to take history onto the court. Of course we will feel confident — we have beaten them once before.’ Embrace: Husband and wife Chris and Gabby Adcock hug after winning their quarter-final match .","England and Scotland clash in the semi-finals of mixed doubles on Saturday .

A man with autism that has rendered him almost mute is about to release an album after he was found to have perfect pitch and an amazing singing voice. Kyle Coleman, 25, from Gwithian, Cornwall, was diagnosed with autism at the age of three and has only ever been able to say a few words. However, his talent was discovered after his mother Caroline took him to a music therapy session in 2009. Hidden talent: Kyle, who is autistic, has a pitch perfect singing voice . Since then music therapist Carine Kelley has been visiting him at home . twice a week and has found that music is an instinctive way for him to . express his emotions. 'It became clear almost immediately that Kyle had a natural affinity . with musical elements and could recreate his favourite songs on the . keyboard with no prior musical knowledge,' she said. 'It is when he sings though that his songs come to life. His personality and emotion shine through in his singing and this has . made it possible for us to develop a special relationship and for Kyle’s . abilities and confidence to soar.' After realising her son had a gift, Ms Coelman took him to Plymouth to see how he would do in a recording studio. Kyle has recovered an album that will give all profits to various autism charities . Unfazed by the new experience Kyle recorded his favourite song, Monday, Monday by the Mamas and Papas. The owner of the studio was so impressed by Kyle’s ability he suggested they consider recording a charity album. Now, 18 months later, Kyle is preparing to make his debut. His mother said: 'There has never been an album recorded and released by an . autistic individual who has very limited language and an inability to . communicate other than just a few words. 'His dad was a musician and he died suddenly two years ago in a motorcycle accident. I think his music ability is from his dad’s side.' Kyle's mother said his personality shone through his songs . Kyle has recorded nine covers - including songs by Robbie Williams, Cat . Stevens and Razorlight - plus one that was written especially for him about autism. The album is being supported by the National Autistic Society (NAS) and will be released to coincide with World Autism Day.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . As a crowd of over 500 swelled in Washington, DC Saturday in protest over last weekend’s George Zimmerman acquittal, some cried for a boycott against Florida. Comedian and long-time civil rights activist Dick Gregory addressed the crowd and told them to hit Florida where it hurts--in the wallet--by steering clear of Disney World and orange juice aisle. The rally was one of many nationwide over the weekend, where demands for ‘Justice for Trayvon’ came in the form of calls for an end to Florida’s Stand Your Ground self-defense laws and for the prosecution of George Zimmerman on charges he violated Trayvon Martin’s civil rights when he shot and killed the 17-year-old last year. News of the boycott call came as Senator John McCain (R-AZ) joined President Barack Obama in calling for a review of Stand Your Ground laws across the nation. Scroll down for video . Rallying cry: Protestors at a rally in Washington, DC called for an end to Stand-Your-Ground type laws and some suggested ways to hit the state of Florida where it hurts . 'Going to see a rat': Famed comedian and civil rights trailblazer Dick Gregory called for a boycott on Florida orange juice and on the state's tourist attractions like Disney World . 'I can also see that Stand Your Ground laws may be something that needs to be reviewed by the Florida legislature or any other legislature that has passed such legislation,' McCain told CNN, adding that his home state of Arizona should consider similar action. McCain stopped short of calling for tougher gun controls though, saying 'I don’t frankly see the connection.. While praising protestors who staged a . sit-in as an attempt to cajole Florida Governor Rick Scott into meeting . with them, Gregory told the crowd outside the federal courthouse in . Washington that musician Stevie Wonder had the right idea when he . pledged to no longer perform in Florida. ‘How . many of y’all have been to Disneyland to see a rat,’ Gregory asked with . trademark humor. ‘But haven’t walked down the street to see King’s . tomb? Had he not died, you wouldn’t be welcome in Orlando. So we not . asking you to do anything that costs you. We just say save your money. Don’t spend it.’ As some members of the crowd chanted ‘boycott Florida,’ Gregory continued with his characteristic humor, according to Breitbart.com. ‘Some . of y’all ain’t been to Florida in your life and ain’t going,’ said . Gregory. ‘And all you got to do is get Florida to come to you. Now what . do I mean by that? They got oranges that they can’t afford to have you . not buy because they will rot.’ 'Justice 4 Trayvon': Around 500 gathered at the Washington protest on Saturday outside the federal courthouse . Powerful images: Skittles candy borders a sketch on the ground, representing Trayvon Martin, during a 'Justice for Trayvon -100 City Vigil' in Washington on Saturday . ‘I said to my grandmother, 'We not . going to boycott Florida orange juice because Florida orange juice is . sold under different names. We going to boycott orange juice,’ he said. ‘And when them orange growers start running in to take that governor and . he knows he can’t stand his ground with them.’ ‘Justice . for Trayvon’ rallies continued elsewhere, as racial tensions remain . high—and calls for change remain loud—across the U.S. in the wake of . Zimmerman’s acquittal. We . have the strength to wipe our tears away. Last Saturday we cried. This . Saturday we march,' came the words of Reverend Al Sharpton as he . addressed the crowds of a New York City protest Saturday. Coast to Coast: The gathering of 500 protestors in Washington was one of dozens that took place nationwide on Saturday . Stand your ground: The Washington protest, like many nationwide, called for an end to Stand Your Ground laws and for the prosecution of George Zimmerman . Trayvon's . mother, Sybrina Fulton, also spoke at the New York rally, telling the . crowd: 'Today it was my son. Tomorrow it might be yours.' Ms Fulton, her son Jahvaris, and Sharpton joined the rally as it marched to One Police Plaza at . noon, where they were joined by Jay Z and his wife Beyonce, according to . the New York Post. Beyonce . had shown her support for the case last week, asking for a moment of . silence at a concert after the not guilty verdict was recorded. While Trayvon's mother was in New York, the dead teenager's father took part in a Miami rally on Saturday morning, according to NBC News.

The Reverend Sharpton and other supporters want the Justice Department to pursue federal civil rights charges against Mr Zimmerman. He . told the rally on Saturday: 'They will not say that was the young man . killed in Sanford. They will say that was the young man who helped . change the laws in the United States of America.' Speech: Meanwhile, in Miami, Trayvon's father Tracy Martin told crowds there that he will continue to fight for his son . Rally: Crowds gathered outside the federal courthouse in Miami as part of a nationwide response to the verdict in the George Zimmerman case . Former . Governor Eliot Spitzer, who attended the New York rally, said: . 'Regardless of how you view the legality of the verdict in isolation, . justice here was denied. An innocent young man was shot and killed and . that is a tragedy.' Attorney General Eric Holder . announced last week that the department would investigate whether the . Hispanic neighborhood watch man could be charged under those federal . civil rights laws, which would require evidence that he harbored racial . animosity against Trayvon. Most legal experts said it would be a difficult charge to bring. Support: People march through Oakland, California, as part of the Justice for Trayvon rally . Debate: The rallies, including this one in Los Angeles, were organized to call for civil liberty charges to be brought against Mr Zimmerman . Campaign: In Austin, Texas, crowds marched while carrying banners . Mr Holder added that the shooting demonstrated the need to re-examine stand-your-ground laws nationwide. The . Reverend Jeffrey Johnson told about 200 people in Indianapolis that the . rally was about making life safer for young black men. The Rev Johnson said there were still . endangered by racial profiling, and he compared Mr Zimmerman’s . acquittal to that of four white officers in the beating of black . motorist Rodney King in 1992, according to the Boston Globe. 'The . verdict freed George Zimmerman, but it condemned America more,' the . pastor who is a member of the board of directors of the National Action . Network, said. On Friday .

It is a disservice to both competitions to compare the Commonwealths — the ‘Friendly Games’ —  to the Olympics, but there is one legacy of London 2012 that is very much alive in Glasgow. The Australians are desperate to forget about their embarrassing performance two years ago, when they finished a lowly 10th in the medals table. Beset by in-fighting and lacking discipline, they won only seven golds as Great Britain plundered 29 to finish third overall. The Commonwealth Games have, therefore, suddenly become very important for Australia as a great sporting nation attempts to rebuild towards the Olympics in 2016. Australia need a strong performance at the Commonwealth Games after being embarrassed at London 2012 . Where once the  Games might have been a chance to impress Australia’s might on fellow Commonwealth countries, there is now considerable pride at stake. The 2018 Games will take place on the Gold Coast, and Australia has topped every medals table at the Commonwealths since 1986. The country’s chef de mission, Steve Moneghetti, wants 111 medals as a minimum in Glasgow, although he has admitted Australia will have their ‘work cut out just to win the medal tally, let alone dominate it’. England are very different to the weakened team that arrived in Delhi in 2010. Many of their  high-profile stars stayed at home rather than risk their safety and security just two years from London 2012. But the Commonwealth Games just across the border is a very different matter. England, for example, have won three golds, a silver and a bronze as they dominated the men’s, women’s and mixed team medley events in triathlon while Australia have had to make do with a bronze. Alistair Brownlee helped England dominate the triathlon with three golds while Australia won only a bronze . Shooter Michael Gault has a chance to overtake Australian Phillip Adams' record Commonwealth medal haul . Australian shooter Phillip Adams, the most decorated Commonwealth Games athlete, also now has an Englishman for company after 60-year-old grandfather Mick Gault won a bronze in the 10m air pistol yesterday. Gault now has the opportunity to go one clear of Adams and win his 19th medal in the 50m air pistol. Yet in the pool and on the track cycling, some things never change. Australian Anna Meares has already won the 500m time trial and will face compatriot Stephanie Morton as she bids for her six Commonwealth title in the women’s sprint. The double Olympic champion, 30, looked as imperious as ever on Saturday as she swatted aside England’s Jess Varnish in her semi-final. Australia won the first seven races of the evening session inside the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome, including gold for Annette Edmondson in the 10k scratch race. The Australian, whose mother Cathy grew up in Elgin, gained revenge over England’s Joanna Rowsell, who beat her comprehensively in the individual pursuit  final on Friday, and led an Australian one-two ahead of Amy Cure. Wales’ Elinor Barker was third. Some things never change: Anna Meares is bidding for her sixth Commonwealth title in the sprint . The day had begun with a thrilling contest between Australia and England in the group stage of the netball, with the team in green and gold sneaking a 49-48 win in the last 30 seconds.  Netball has been dominated by Australia and New Zealand, the highest ranked teams in the world, since it was introduced into the Commonwealths in 1998, but England still maintain this is their chance to improve on their three bronze medals to date. Anna Mayes’s side thrashed Australia 3-0 in a Test series last year, but the doubts resurfaced yesterday as England squandered a 16-10 lead and suffered a crushing defeat by an aggressive Australian side. It does not make England’s dream of gold impossible, but life will be harder given New Zealand are the likely semi-final opponents for the team finishing second in this group. With the scores level at 48-48 after going with the centre pass, England goal shooter Joanne Harten, one of the five English women who play in Australia and New Zealand’s semi-professional ANZ Championship, failed to convert a shot at goal. Hoop dreams: Favourites Australia fought to a narrow 49-48 victory over England in the basketball . Crying game: England's Joanne Harten is left in tears after Australia's late vitory . Australia raced to the other end and Caitlin Bassett scored her 36th goal of the morning to claim victory, leaving Harten in tears. England goalkeeper Geva Mentor said: ‘We’re still serious contenders. I’m very excited by this team and I know we can go all the way.’ England’s Ed Clancy was unable to claim a podium place as Australian Scott Sunderland took gold by setting a new Games record of 1min 0.675secs in the final race of the 1000m time trial.","Australia need to return to former glories at the Commonwealth Games .

"By . Mark Duell . This is the astonishing moment a female Lidl store assistant abused a customer because she thought he was Muslim. Witnesses, who saw the drama unfold, said the man got into an argument with the cashier in front of other customers because he did not know that carrier bags in the supermarket must be paid for. The clip was taken at a store in Balsall Heath, Birmingham, - and not all the conversation is audible, but towards the end of the video, the cashier can be heard screeching: ‘Go on, you Muslim, die.’ Scroll down for video . Abuse: Towards the end of the video, the Lidle cashier can be heard screeching: 'Go on, you Muslim, die' Argument: The man allegedly did not know that carrier bags in the supermarket have to be paid for . The cashier repeatedly swears at the man in the clip taken on Tuesday, while customers watch, and describes him as an ‘arrogant Muslim’. At one point she appears to address him as ‘Mohammed’. A witness, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘He was confused that there were no carrier bags, and when he asked her for help she didn’t seem to have much time for him. ‘Then he made a comment about the way she was speaking to him and she just exploded.’ The man can be heard protesting, saying: ‘You’re having a bad day and you’re just taking it out on me’ - to which the cashier responds with: ‘I was having a good day until I saw your f***ing face.’ Footage: The cashier at the Lidl store repeatedly swears at the man while customers stand in the queue . Scene: The two-minute clip was taken at the supermarket's store in Balsall Heath, Birmingham, on Tuesday .

"By . Associated Press . An Oscar-nominated, Palestinian director was detained as he entered the U.S. on Tuesday for this week's awards ceremony and his family threatened with deportation. Emad Burnat says that when he arrived at . Los Angeles International Airport from Turkey with his wife and . eight-year-old son, customs agents told them they didn't have the proper proof . that he was a nominee and would send them back if they couldn't verify . the reason for their visit. The director had brought his family to LA for Sunday's Oscars where his documentary 5 Broken Cameras has been nominated for an Academy Award. Spotlight: Palestinian filmmaker Emad Burnat (left) and movie partner Guy Davidi (right) from Israell at the Oscars luncheon in LA on February 4. Burnat was detailed by immigration on his way to the awards because they did not believe he was nominated . Outrage: Director Michael Moore, a supporter of Mr Burnat, expressed his disgust on Twitter at his friend's treatment on entering the U.S. After about an hour of questioning, the agents allowed Mr Burnat and his family to enter the country. Oscar-winning documentarian Michael Moore said on his website that he helped clear up the matter by making some phone calls to Oscars' officials on Burnat's behalf. Burnat had been in the United States two weeks earlier doing interviews about the film alongside his co-director, Israeli activist Guy Davidi. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that it is prohibited from discussing specific cases, but noted that in general: 'Travelers may be referred for further inspection for a variety of reasons to include identity verification, intent of travel and confirmation of admissibility.' Michael Moore, a friend of Burnat's and a champion of his work, wrote on his website, michaelmoore.com, that Burnat texted him from an airport holding area seeking help. Moore said he made a few calls to leaders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who contacted some attorneys to clear up the matter. Moore tweeted: 'Apparently the Immigration & Customs officers couldn't understand how a Palestinian could be an Oscar nominee. Emad texted me for help.' The Academy did not respond to a request for comment on Burnat's detainment. World-class talent: A still from Emad Burnat's Oscar-nominated 5 Broken Cameras which has already won at Sundance . Upsetting: Mr Burnat's son Gibreel, aged eight, who inspired his father's Oscar-nominated film, was also held by immigration . 5 Broken Cameras, the first Palestinian documentary ever nominated for an Oscar, already has won awards at the Sundance Film Festival and the Cinema Eye Honors. It features footage that the olive farmer-turned-filmmaker shot using five cameras in his occupied West Bank village of Bil'in, from everyday activities with his family to protests and shootings. The son with whom he is traveling, Gibreel, was the inspiration for buying the first of these cameras in 2005; like so many parents, Burnat wanted to document the boy's first steps and smiles. However he also found himself wanting to capture the tension and fighting that are daily occurrences in the struggle for territory. In the film, his cameras keep getting destroyed in the violence. Fury: Michael Moore spoke publicly about the treatment that Mr Burnat had received while trying to enter the U.S. on his way to Sunday's Oscars . Because of his experiences, Burnat said in a statement on Wednesday, he's gotten used to the kind of questioning he and his family underwent at LAX. Mr Burnat said: 'There are more than 500 Israeli checkpoints, roadblocks, and other barriers to movement across our land, and not a single one of us has been spared the experience that my family and I experienced yesterday. 'Ours was a very minor example of what my people face every day.'","Emad Burnat nominated for much lauded documentary 5 Broken Cameras .

"By . Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent . Ed Miliband has admitted he looks less like a Prime Minister than David Cameron – and highlighted his resemblance to Wallace of Wallace and Gromit fame. Declaring that ‘there’s more to politics than the photo op’, the Labour leader attempted to portray himself as a politician of substance, compared with Mr Cameron’s political ‘posturing’ and focus on appearance. But within minutes of finishing his speech yesterday, it emerged Labour is to hire an £80,000-a-year spin doctor to improve the way Mr Miliband looks on television. Photo flop: Ed Miliband (left) admitted to his rather unfortunate likeness to Wallace (right) of Wallace in Gromit . And critics pointed out that he left the country this week – missing a debate on the Ukraine plane crash in the process – for a photo opportunity with US President Barack Obama. Social media sites lit up with cringeworthy pictures of Mr Miliband posing for ‘selfies’ with celebrities including The Only Way Is Essex star Joey Essex, singer Lily Allen and artist Grayson Perry. The speech marked the start of a six-week campaign by senior Labour figures designed to reverse the party’s slide in the polls and shape Mr Miliband as a potential future Prime Minister. As he attempted to change the terms of political debate around his appearance, Mr Miliband admitted that if he fought the campaign as a ‘photo op contest’ he would not win the General Election. Food for thought: That bacon sandwich photograph (left) (and Wallace, right, fares no better in his attempt) Labour . leader Ed Miliband has struggled to shake off criticism of his public . image, most notably after he appeared to struggle to eat a bacon . sandwich during a photo opportunity at New Covent Garden Market . He conceded he was neither ‘square-jawed’ nor ‘chiselled’ and did not look like a politician out of ‘central casting’. Mr Miliband added: ‘I am not trying to win a photo op contest in the next ten months. And I wouldn’t win it if I tried.’ David Cameron repeatedly mistook Teesside for Tyneside yesterday – during an interview with Radio Tees. The . Prime Minister listed what he thought were the Government’s economic . achievements in the area, but repeatedly referred to Tyneside. The . presenter Lisa McCormick snapped: ‘You keep mentioning the River Tyne. That’s not our region, Prime Minister. I’m sorry, we are the River . Tees.’ The Tyne runs through Newcastle, while the Tees lies 30 miles to the south. Mr . Cameron, who was conducting one of half a dozen back-to-back local . radio interviews from London, replied: ‘I’m sorry, I thought I was . doing…’ Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, said it showed Mr Cameron was ‘out of touch’. And, extraordinarily, he said the changes he wanted to make to the country would take more than two terms of Government – an apparent pitch for three consecutive Labour terms. In his speech to Labour supporters in central London, Mr Miliband attempted to present himself as serious and principled compared to Mr Cameron’s ‘superficial’ and image-driven approach. The photo opportunity, he said, is ‘not where my talents lie – as you may have noticed’. He said: ‘I am not from central casting. You can find people who are more square-jawed, more chiselled, look less like Wallace. ‘You could probably even find people who look better eating a bacon sandwich. If you want the politician from central casting, it’s just not me, it’s the other guy. ‘And if you want a politician  who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing, then don’t vote for me. Because I don’t. But here’s the thing: I believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo op. And that culture diminishes our politics.’ He said Mr Cameron was ‘a very sophisticated and successful exponent of a politics driven by image’, who had posed with huskies before the election to highlight climate change – but went on to turn his back on green issues. This week Mr Miliband flew to Washington for a 'brush by' meeting and photo opportunity with Barack Obama . In . April this year Mr Miliband managed to squeeze into a celebrity selfie . with TOWIE star Joey Essex, artist Grayson Perry, actress Emma Thompson . and author Kathy Lette . Mr Cameron said Mr Miliband’s speech proved he was the leader who lacked substance. ‘On a day when our national output has recovered to where it was before the great recession, which was brought to us by Labour, I think it was an extraordinary thing to say, ‘ said the Prime Minister. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘If he wants to be taken seriously he should be talking about the economy and how we can secure a better future for our children and grandchildren. Not why he struggles to eat a bacon sandwich.’ During . last year's Labour party conference, Mr Miliband posed with his Justine . and sons Daniel (centre) and Sam (L) for a walk along Brighton beach .","Ed Miliband admitted he looks less like a Prime Minister than Cameron .

"By . Rob Shepherd . Follow @@robshepherd5 . Most . of the debate leading up to England's showdown with Uruguay has been . about Wayne Rooney and where he should play or if at all. That . big debate has disguised the fact that England skipper Steven Gerrard . was far from a commanding figure against Italy and he certainly didn't . pull any strings in his new quarter back role in comparison to Andrea . Pirlo for Italy. But in Gerrard's defence he did hold his position and thus helped England keep their shape for most of the game. Against . Uruguay though Gerrard must impose himself more. If not then Roy . Hodgson must not be afraid to sub his captain and put on Frank Lampard. Otherwise what was the point in picking the former Chelsea man in the . first place? One aspect of England's opening game defeat to Italy was the sporting spirit which it was played in with the sole yellow card falling to Raheem Sterling late on for a blatant 'technical foul'. Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers deserves much credit for how he allowed the game to flow but it could be another story in the Three Lions' clash against Uruguay on Thursday. Spanish referee Carlos Carballo has a reputation of being an over-fussy official who at one stage of his career averaged six yellow cards a game. He is now a bit less trigger happy but in the Euro 2012 opener between Poland and Greece he  issued two red cards. Seeing yellow: Raheem Sterling (left) was the only player to be booked during England's 2-1 defeat to Italy . Trigger happy: Referee Carlos Carbello (left) sent off two players in the Euro 2012 opener of Poland vs Greece . It's interesting to note that while Sterling was the stand out player against Italy, covering 6.52 miles, two England players travelled further in the match. Wayne Rooney clocked up 6.97 miles while Gerrard covered 6.58 - which just goes to show why that kind of stat is often meaningless. Working up a sweat: Wayne Rooney (left) ran 6.97 miles during England's Group D opener against Italy . While Roy Hodgson looks set to tinker with his system against Uruguay, if not personnel, Holland boss Louis van Gaal is revealing to Manchester United fans one his great strengths as a coach ahead of next season. The 62-year-old has a well thought-out plan and team in his mind and he sticks to it. Holland named the same starting line-up for their first two World Cup Group B wins, against Spain and Australia, with the starting eleven numbered 1-11 - making them the only the nation to have done that so far. Talk about having a plan. It also suggests Van Gaal won't succumb to Wayne Rooney deciding where he wants to play at Old Trafford. Tactical genius: Louis van Gaal has masterminded Holland to two wins out of two at the World Cup . The have been some truly stunning goals at the his World Cup but precious few long range scorchers. Holland's late winner struck by Memphis Depay, whose name sounds like a Blues singer, was a rarity. Thus far only 13 per cent of goals have been stuck from more than 20 yards. Scorcher: Memphis Depay scored Holland's winner their 3-2 victory vs Australia with a long-range strike . Look Out For . If you can manage to carry on after the England match then Japan's Keisuke Honda is a player to keep an eye out for. The AC Milan midfielder scored a super goal and oozed class in Japan's 2-1 defeat to the Ivory Coast but they should bounce back against Greece if Honda produces similar form. Top draw: Keisuke Honda (front) enjoyed a fine performance in Japan's 2-1 defeat to Ivory Coast . World Cup Bet . The bookies make Daniel Sturridge a slight favourite to draw first blood in the SAS showdown at 5-1 to score the opening goal while Luis Suarez is 6-1. This might sound a bit left field but I just fancy Leighton Baines, who got unfair stick after the Italy game, at 22-1. If England get an early free kick in his 'zone' then it could happen. Brazil remain 7-2 favourites to win the tournament but Holland have been cut to 11-1. Could this at long last but an Oranje summer? Worth a punt? Daniel Sturridge is the bookies favourites to score first in England's clash against Uruguay . World Cup Memory . It became one of the most tragic episodes in football history. Much fancied Columbia flopped at the 1994 World Cup finals not least because of the influence drug cartels and betting syndicates around the squad. They were knocked out when defender Andres Escobar scored an own goal in defeat to the USA. A few days later having returned home to Medellin, Escobar was shot dead outside a bar after a row with some gangsters.

"By . Anna Edwards . A Banksy artwork ripped down from a north London street is to be auctioned, just months after another in the same borough was controversially sold for a reported £750,000. No Ball Games was removed from the side of a shop in Turnpike Lane, Tottenham Green, and will be sold next year by the Sincura Group - the company which arranged the sale of Slave Labour in May. The Sincura Group claims the street graffiti, which shows two children playing with a sign that reads No Ball Games, has been 'salvaged for renovation' and is now under their management. Sincura Group intends to sell the artwork, created by street artist Banksy in 2009, next year and in the meantime it has been 'gifted' to a local charity . A statement on its website reads: 'A number of attempts have been made over the past to deface the piece, most famously in 2012 by King Robbo who holds a rivalry with the elusive artist. 'With extensive building works taking place in the local vicinity, and further concerns upon its safety, the piece has been removed to be sensitively restored to its former glory.' It added that it intends to sell the artwork, created by street artist Banksy in 2009, next year and in the meantime it has been 'gifted' to a local charity. The company sparked outrage among residents earlier this year when it announced it was selling Slave Labour, which depicts a young boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting. The last section of the wall containing the piece of the Banksy artwork 'No Ball Games' in the process of being removed from the wall of the store in Tottenham . The unsuccessful campaign to return the . 'symbol of local pride' to Wood Green was supported by Haringey Council, . which now faces the prospect of a second battle. But the company insists it has committed no 'wrongdoing'. 'The Sincura Group do not condone any acts of wanton vandalism or other illegal activity, however after carrying out extensive due diligence with regard the works' provenance and ownership we are entirely satisfied that there are no wrong-doings entered in to and are happy to be representing the No Ball Games piece,' the statement added. No Ball Games will be one of three 'controversial headline pieces' to be sold at the auction. A spokesman for Haringey Borough Council told the Haringey Independent that it is trying to contact the owners of the building to find out more information. A 'signature' on the section of a removed part of the Banksy artwork. the company insists it has committed no 'wrongdoing' This is not the first time a mural by the famous guerilla artist has been removed to be restored. In May a giant Banksy on the side of a crumbling Grade II listed building with an estimated value of £1million was removed. The giant rat, which was created by Britain's most famous street artist, has been eroding for years, with large parts having peeled off with the plaster or vanished on rotted wood. But a special restoration team were drafted in to remove the painting from the old Whitehorse pub in Liverpool's China town as part of plans to re-open the building. Bristol-born Banksy daubed the huge rat wielding a machine gun on the Georgian building as part of the city's Biennial art programme in 2004. Banksy has since conquered the art world, selling his unique pieces for millions, and counts Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie amongst his fans. Britain's biggest Banksy, previously valued at £1million, adorned the pub and campaigns to restore the artwork, have led to its inclusion in plans to gain planning permission from Liverpool city council. In London Banksy art trails are a huge draw for tourists and special crack teams ensure his graffiti stays in top condition.","No Ball Games was removed from a wall in Turnpike Lane, Tottenham Green .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . The FBI claims a thorough search of their archives revealed no evidence of  tapes showing Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh had a accomplice . The FBI has dismissed claims they are withholding security camera footage that proves a second man was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing, insisting agents searched their archives thoroughly and found no evidence of any such material. Salt Lake City lawyer Jesse Trentadue has launched a freedom of information lawsuit against the FBI and the CIA, demanding they release the alleged videos which supposedly show a man alongside Timothy McVeigh when he parked a truck outside the Oklahoma City federal building and detonated a bomb that killed 168 people. But yesterday, . on the first day of the trial, Linda Vernon, a longtime FBI . employee who became the point person for the collection of evidence . after the bombing, said she is 'completely confident' the agency has . found every video of the bombing that exists. FBI . attorney Kathryn Wyer argued additional searches for videos would be . burdensome and fruitless, and would take a single staff person more than . 18 months to conduct. She said: 'The plaintiff has refused to accept that the 30 tapes he got are the only tapes'. Mr Trentadue believes the presence of a . second suspect in the truck explains why his brother, Kenneth Trentadue, . was flown to Oklahoma several months after the bombing, where he died . in a federal holding cell in what was labeled a suicide. His . belief that the tapes exists stems from a Secret Service document . written shortly after the bombing that describes security video footage . of the attack that shows suspects - in plural - exiting the truck three . minutes before it went off. Kenneth . Trentadue bore a striking resemblance to the police sketch that . officials sent out after the bombing based on witness descriptions of . the enigmatic suspect 'John Doe No. 2,' who was the same height, build . and complexion. The suspect was never identified. Scroll down for video . On a mission: Jesse Trentadue is on a quest to explain his brother's mysterious jail cell death that has rekindled long-dormant questions about whether others were involved in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing . Looking for answers: Kenneth Trentadue was found bruised and stabbed by his family after the FBI said he hanged himself . The 30 video recordings the FBI has released don't show the explosion or McVeigh's arrival in a rental truck. The . FBI already has provided videos and paper documents that correspond . with Trentadue's Freedom of Information Act request, Ms Wyer said. The . trial continues Today and will run at least through Wednesday before . the judge makes a ruling. He could wait until a later date to decide. If . Mr Trentadue wins, he hopes to be able to search for the tapes himself . rather than having to accept the FBI's answer that they don't exist. Mr . Trentadue is acting as his own attorney and tried to show that the FBI . has not adequately followed up on information that could lead to the . discovery of other videos. He . asked Monica Mitchell of the FBI about why the agency had not done more . to search for a tape mentioned in a Secret Service log. It describes . security video footage of suspects — in plural — exiting the truck three . minutes before the bomb went off. 'Didn't it come to your mind that that tape may exist?' Mr Trentadue asked. Ms . Mitchell said she didn't know the authenticity of the Secret Service . document and that Vernon told her she didn't know of the existence of . such a tape. Mr Trentadue . asked if Ms Mitchell had asked FBI headquarters about the tape, citing . documents that show it had one tape and 300 pages of documents. She . acknowledged she had not asked headquarters about those items as part of . the FOIA request. The wreckage of the Alfred P Murrah building burned itself into the national psyche in 19956 but did McVeigh have company when he planted the bomb that did it? Was another man involved? Terry Nichols (left) was sentenced to life in prison for helping McVeigh plot his terrorist act. Michael Fortier, the star witness in the Oklahoma City bombing trials, was released from federal prison in 2006 after serving a sentence for failing to inform authorities of what he knew about the bombing plot . A Secret . Service agent testified in 2004 that the log does exist, but its . information was pulled from reports that were never verified, said Stacy . A. Bauerschmidt, who was then the assistant to the special agent in . charge of the FBI's intelligence division. Several . investigators and prosecutors who worked the case told The Associated . Press in 2004 they had never seen video like that described in the . Secret Service log. Mitchell . and Vernon described how employees searched automated systems and by . hand. Vernon said she spent 85 hours searching three computer databases . created to track all the evidence. The . judge at one point asked Mitchell why the FBI never responded to a . letter from Trentadue asking about a video that seemed to be incomplete. 'You basically did nothing?' Waddoups asked. 'We did nothing because we were confident in our search and what we located,' Mitchell said. Later, . he questioned why Vernon neglected to send several documents to . Trentadue that mentioned videos, despite her previous claim that she . erred on the side of inclusivity if she wasn't sure whether something . fell under his request. Trentadue's . 44-year-old brother, who was a convicted bank robber and construction . worker, was brought to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons' Federal Transfer . Center in Oklahoma City after being picked up for probation violations . while coming back to the U.S. at the Mexican border, Jesse Trentadue . said. Taking the feds to court: Now Trentadue is on a mission to reveal the truth about his brother's death and his suing the FBI to get answers . Unsatisfied . by the FBI's previous explanations, U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups . has ordered the agency to explain why it can't find videos from the . bombing that are mentioned in evidence logs, citing the public . importance of the tapes. 'I . did not start out to solve the Oklahoma City bombing, I started out for . justice for my brother's murder,' Jesse Trentadue said. 'But along the . way, every path I took, every lead I got, took me to the bombing.' The . FBI says it can't find anything to suggest the videos exist, and says . it would be 'unreasonably burdensome' to do a search that would take a . single staff person more than 18 months to conduct. Kathy . Sanders and Jannie Coverdale, who both lost grandchildren in the . bombing, are grateful for Trentadue's pursuit of the case.

"By . Associated Press . A soccer referee who was fatally punched by a player during a recreational game in suburban Detroit did not expect the attack, one of the player's teammates testified on Wednesday. Dr. Jamal Saleh testified during a probable-cause hearing for Bassel Saad, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of referee John Bieniewicz. The 44-year-old referee 'did not see the punch coming,' said Saleh, who played for Saad's team during the over-30 men's league game at Mies Park in Livonia on June 29. Bieniewicz, a dialysis technician at a local hospital, had a wife and two sons. Defendant Bassel Saad sobs during a probable-cause hearing on Wednesday afternoon in Livonia, Michigan. Saad is charged with second-degree murder in the death of soccer referee John Bieniewicz . John Bieniewicz (pictured), who was punched in the head on June 29 while refereeing an adult-league soccer match in the Detroit-area, died on July 1 . Two players from the opposing team also testified that Saad knocked Bieniewicz to the turf with one punch after the referee indicated he planned to eject Saad from the game. The punch, which Saleh said landed around the head and neck area, caused Bieniewicz to 'fall back without any control of his body.' Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other. In soccer, a yellow card is held aloft by the referee to caution a player following a foul or other misconduct. A red card is shown by the referee when a player is being thrown out of the game. Two yellow cards given in the same game equal a red card. Witness Scott Herkes, left, demonstrates with defense attorney Ali Hammoud how he said Bassel Saad punched soccer referee John Bieniewicz, during a court hearing on Wednesday in Livonia, Michigan . In this case, the players testified that Saad had been issued a yellow card following a foul in the first half, and Bieniewicz was giving him a second yellow for being verbally abusive. That's when he was struck, the three players said. A skirmish erupted between players following the attack. Saleh said he quickly checked on Bieniewicz and the referee initially was not breathing but had a pulse. Saleh said he performed CPR and told the unconscious Bieniewicz: 'Wake up, buddy. You're going to be OK.' Player Scott Herkes testified that Saad removed his jersey and left the field with another man as Bieniewicz was being tended to. Herkes said he followed the men into the parking lot and took down the license plate number of the vehicle in which they left. Prosecutors showed a photograph in which Saad appeared to be making an obscene gesture while seated in the vehicle. A man who was punched in the head on June 29 while refereeing an adult-league soccer match in the Detroit-area has died. John Bieniewicz, who was attacked on Sunday at a park in Livonia, Michigan died at Detroit Receiving Hospital on Tuesday, said hospital spokesman Alton Gunn . Saad, a 36-year-old auto mechanic from Dearborn, had been charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm before Bieniewicz died on July 1. That charge was formally dropped, and prosecutors issued the murder charge. The probable-cause hearing in Livonia District Court, which will determine whether to send the case to trial, resumed today. It ended with Judge Kathleen McCann denying prosecutors' motion to bring up an alleged 2005 incident in which Saad is said to have been involved in an altercation with another player at a soccer game. Defense lawyer Ali Hammoud said his client's past has nothing to do with this case, and prosecutors' interest in bringing it up shows that 'their case is extremely weak on second-degree murder.'","Bassel Saad, 36, charged with second-degree murder in Livonia, Michigan for the fatal punch on June 29 .

"By . Rosie Taylor . They are the programmes that leave viewers enthralled by the wonders of nature. But many wildlife scenes in BBC series are faked, a veteran cameraman admits. In fact, most footage involving small animals is not what it appears, Doug Allan said. Secret's out: Experienced cameraman Doug Allan let slip the fakery in a speech at the Cheltenham Literature Festival . Species ‘smaller than a baby rabbit’ are put in custom-built sets and filmed under controlled conditions, rather than in the wild. Mr Allan’s revelation comes only two years after Sir David Attenborough’s flagship documentary Frozen Planet was accused of fakery for filming the birth of a polar bear in a zoo rather than in the wild. The footage was defended at the time by the veteran naturalist, who compared nature documentaries to ‘making movies’. But Mr Allan – once described by Sir David as the best cameraman he had worked with –  said he understood why people felt ‘deceived’. He said: ‘I think the BBC didn’t handle it the best. On their website there was a video showing how it was done, but they didn’t quite bring enough attention to it. It wasn’t obvious.’ Mr Allan defended the use of captive animals in wildlife films, so long as producers make it clear to audiences which shots are not gathered in the wild. Proud: Mr Allan said the BBC should have been open about the fact that some scenes for recent David Attenborough series Frozen planet were filmed in a zoo . Preparing for the new arrivals: The fake nest being built in a Dutch zoo, ahead of the birth of the polar bear cubs . Not as it seems: The 'den' in the wildlife park was constructed out of plaster and wood, built below the zoo's polar bear enclosure. It was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth . ‘You can’t make a film about mice just by going out into a meadow and looking at mice,’ he said. ‘You need to introduce them to a safely built set in which they will be happy. There’s a lot of skill in doing that.’ Asked whether cameramen were worried about filming wildlife on sets, he said they ‘have to do and accept it’, adding: ‘Nobody seemed to be bothered by it.’ Mr Allan was speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, where he is promoting his book Freeze Frame: A Wildlife Cameraman’s Adventures On Ice. He said the BBC should have been proud of the way in which it gathered the Frozen Planet footage rather than hiding the explanation on its website. The sequence showed the new-born polar bears mewling and nuzzling their mother in a cave. Eight million viewers were led to believe the footage was captured by BBC cameramen in harsh sub-zero temperatures. However, it emerged it was actually shot in a Dutch zoo, using fake snow. Moving scene: The pair of two-day-old polar bear cubs shown on the documentary. At this age they weighed less than a kilo, but were filmed in a zoo . New build: The polar bear and cub inside the man-made den fashioned out of wood and covered in fake snow . Faked? What the viewers saw on Frozen Planet turned out not to be filmed in the wild, but in a Netherlands zoo . It was interspersed with real shots of the Arctic, while Sir David’s carefully worded narration led viewers to believe the scene was genuine. The veteran broadcaster, 87, defended the footage at the time, saying: ‘Come on, we were making movies.’ But Mr Allan said the BBC should have flagged up its filming techniques at the end of the programme. He said: ‘Be proud of it, and then I think people would have felt less deceived. I don’t have a problem with that sort of thing – I did it myself years earlier – but the public, some of the public, chose to think that was fakery.’ Mr Allan was not involved in the polar bear scene and does not film small animals. Mixed: The scene was mixed with real footage of polar bears in the wild, which may have misled viewers . He also addressed the future of nature documentaries, saying there would be no one like Sir David on television again and claiming the presenter’s involvement in a programme guaranteed 20 per cent more viewers. ‘There will never be another David,’ he said. ‘As long as David is alive, for anyone else to be called “the next David Attenborough” is a kiss of death. The way television works these days, a presenter is doing well if they last more than ten years. ‘On the BBC, you’ll see a lot of new faces that are being tried out. Some are good, some you see once and then bye bye.’ But if anyone is to follow in Sir David’s footsteps, Mr Allan said, it will be Springwatch presenter Chris Packham because he has ‘integrity’ even though he is not ‘everyone’s cup of tea’. Kept quiet: Mr Allan said it would be impossible to make programmes about small animals like mice entirely in the wild . Mr Allan also praised Professor Brian Cox, but said he only ‘came alive’ when talking about space and physics rather than wildlife. In June, Sir David praised Mr Allan, who has worked with him on Blue Planet, Frozen Planet and Planet Earth. He said: ‘Capturing animal behaviour in extreme and hostile places takes a very special kind of cameraman and they don’t come more special than Doug Allan. 'I’ve had the extraordinary good luck of working with him over many years and no one knows the frozen world better than him.’","Doug Allan revealed secrets of how BBC makes wildlife films .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A suspect in the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that claimed the life of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, was found dead Monday, according to reports from CNN. The network cites a 'Libyan source and locals in the town of Marj,' who say Faraj al-Shibli was found dead in the eastern Libyan town. The suspected terrorist al-Shibli was last seen as he was being detained by a local militia in Marj on Friday or Saturday. Dead: Faraj al-Shibli, who is believed to have played a role in the Benghazi terrorist attack, was found dead in Libya on Monday . Intelligence officials discovered a link between al-Shibli and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which officials believe took part in the attack on the U.S. diplomatic complex in Benghazi. CNN reports that al-Shibli also had contact with al Qaeda members in Pakistan. In March 2013, al-Shibli was detained by Libyan officials who suspected he had played a part in the attack. During his detention, FBI officials were allowed to interview him in front of Libyan officials. The Libyan warlord who allegedly led the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, has been captured by Delta Force commandos. Ahmed Abu Khattala was taken off the streets of Benghazi and whisked away to a 'secure location outside of Libya' for interrogation on Sunday, the Washington Post reports. Fox News reports that he is currently en route to the United States aboard a U.S. Navy ship. Once on American soil, he is expected to face trial on terrorism charges in federal court in Washington, D.C. Caught: Delta force commandos nabbed Ahmed Abu Khattala, the 42-year-old suspected ringleader in the 2012 Benghazi consulate attack on Sunday after he taunted American officials for months . Khattala is said to be a 'senior leader' of Ansar al-Sharia - the group that U.S. officials believe was behind . the attack that killed four Americans on September 11, 2012 - including . U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens. American officials have stopped short of calling him a 'mastermind.' Nearly two years after the deadly assault, he is the first person held to account by American authorities. Khattala, a 42-year-old hardline Muslim leader, has openly taunted U.S. authorities for years, appearing in public in Benghazi for several interviews with American media, including CNN, in August 2013 - days after the Justice Department levied terrorism charges against him. U.S. commandos and the FBI captured Ahmed Abu Khattala, said to be one of the masterminds behind the 2012 consulate attack in Benghazi, Libya . Burned out: The American consulate in Benghazi was burned out and destroyed by the terrorist attack on September 11, 2012. Khattala is the only person so far arrested for the deadly raid . Khattala has remained free to roam his hometown of Beghanzi, despite being indicted by U.S. authorities.  He said he was never questioned by American officials even though he made no attempt to hide. He told the New York Times that he did not plan or participate in the  assault, though he admitted he was there at the end. Witnesses describe seeing him direct the fighters who stormed the gates of the American compound. The raid Sunday was carried out jointly by Delta Force, the U.S. Army's most elite special operations unit, and the FBI after more than a year of planning, the Daily Beast reports. The commandos even went so far as to build a mock-up of Khattala's compound on their base at Fort Bragg, North Carolina - like the Navy's SEAL Team Six did before the Osama bin Laden raid. However, American officials are billing it as a major achievement for the White House. President Barack Obama trumpeted the victory, saying that Khattala will face 'the full weight of American justice.' 'It's important for us to send a message to the world that when Americans are attacked, no matter how long it takes, we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice,' he said before a speech on manufacturing in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. One source told the Post that Khattala's capture is 'a reminder that when the United States says it’s going to hold someone accountable and he will face justice, this is what we mean.' The White House would not comment on why he was captured now - nearly a year after he was indicted. However, the Daily Beast cites a source who suggests that Obama lacked the legal authority to send troops into Libya unilaterally because Khattala didn't have links to al-Qeada. Only recently have investigators found links between him and the terrorists who attacked the United States in 2001. The time, however, is a victory that comes at a bad time for President Obama foreign policy. The return of prisoner of war Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees and the rise of a violent sectarian uprising in Iraq have had Obama on a back footing. National tragedy: Christopher Stevens, who succumbed to smoke inhalation after the attack, was the first U.S. Ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979 . Former U.S. Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were working as CIA security contractors when they were killed defending from a second wave of the attack . Sean Smith, an IT specialist for the U.S. Foreign Service, was also killed in the attack . Stevens, the first U.S. Ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979, died of smoke inhalation after the terrorist attackers set fire to the U.S. compound. Sean Smith, a 34-year-old computer system manager with the U.S. Foreign Service was also killed. Former U.S. Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods, who were working as U.S. security contractors for the Central Intelligence Agency, died in the second wave of the attack as they defended the adjacent CIA building after mounting a rescue mission. White House spokesman Jay Carney would not comment on where Khattla would be held as he awaits trial - whether it would be in a federal facility or the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Officials told the Post that he would likely remain on the U.S. Navy ship to be interrogated by military and intelligence agents. Then a 'clean team' would be brought in to give him his Miranda Rights and question him in a manner that could be used at a federal trial. The 2012 Benghazi attack has been a major political liability for the White House and for then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Republicans have launched numerous official investigations and alleged that officials botched security at the consulate and ignored Stevens' request for more guards. They also claim Obama Administration officials tried to over up the real motive for the terrorist attack - claiming at the time that it was a riot over an anti-Islamic video - to improve Obama's reelection chances. The House of Representatives recently established a select committee, nearly two years after the incident, to formally review the handling of the run-up to and aftermath of the assault. President Barack Obama: 'With this operation, the United States has once again demonstrated that we will do whatever it takes to see that justice is done when people harm Americans. We will continue our efforts to bring to justice those who were responsible for the Benghazi attacks.' Secretary of State John Kerry: 'This weekend, that work took a dramatic step forward. Ahmed Abu Khatallah, an alleged key leader of the attacks in Benghazi, is now in U.S. custody. He will face a court of law and be held accountable for his actions. This bold action by the superb United States military is a clear reminder to anyone who dares do us harm that they will not escape with impunity.' Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas: 'Khatallah has been openly defying the United States for more than twenty months. Now that he is in custody, the proper authorities should be given ample time to assess what intelligence he may have about ongoing terrorist operations against Americans. Khatallah is a foreign terrorist, captured by our special forces overseas for his violent attack on a U.S. facility. He belongs in Guantanamo and in the military justice system, not in the U.S. civilian court system with the constitutional protections afforded U.S. citizens.' Congressman Ed Royce, Republican of California and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman: 'This is overdue, considering that this individual has made himself available to multiple media outlets in the 19 months since the deaths of four Americans, including the first U.S. Ambassador killed in an attack since 1979. I hope that this capture brings us closer to justice and accountability.  We should right now be getting from him as much intelligence as possible.' Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman: 'I fully support the administration’s efforts to gather intelligence from Abu Khatallah and prosecute him in federal court. Past cases against terrorists like Abu Khatallah have shown that we can obtain intelligence, convict terrorists and lock them away for a very long time. The U.S. criminal justice system has successfully convicted over 500 terrorists since 9/11, and I have full confidence in the ability of our federal courts.'","Faraj al-Shibli was found dead in Marj, Libya, on Sunday .

"By . Associated Press . Dan Brown's description of Manila as 'the gates of hell' in the American novelist's latest book has not gone down well with officials in the Philippine capital. The book 'Inferno,' which is being sold in the Philippines, describes a visitor to the city who is taken aback by poverty, crime and prostitution. The chairman of metropolitan Manila, Francis Tolentino, wrote an open letter to Brown on Thursday, saying that while 'Inferno' is fiction, 'we are greatly disappointed by your inaccurate portrayal of our beloved metropolis.' Raising ire: Author Dan Brown, left, has been blasted by officials in the Philippines for a quote in his latest novel Inferno, right, that likens the city to 'the gates of hell' Tolentino objected to the 'gates of hell' description, and to Manila being defined by what he calls terrible descriptions of poverty and pollution. He said that the novel fails to acknowledge Filipinos' good character and compassion. 'Truly, our place is an entry to heaven,' Tolentino said. 'We hope that this letter enlightens you and may it guide you the next time you cite Manila in any of your works.' Brown's publisher, Doubleday, declined comment when contacted by The Associated Press. 'Inferno' is already a best-seller a little over a week since its debut. The story drawn partly from Dante's epic again features Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, the protagonist for Brown's blockbuster 'The Da Vinci Code' and its follow-up 'The Lost Symbol.'

In the book, Langdon's companion depicts Manila as a city of 'six-hour traffic jams, suffocating pollution, horrifying sex trade.' 'I've run through the gates of hell,' she said. It's not the first time that authorities have been angered by an unflattering description of the sprawling city of some 12 million people, where urban shanties and the homeless exist side by side with glitzy shopping malls and walled residential compounds. In 1999, then-President Joseph Estrada banned Hollywood actress Claire Danes, who shot the movie 'Brokedown Palace' in Manila, from entering the country after she said in an interview that the city was smelly, weird and full of rats. Estrada was elected mayor of Manila in last week's elections on a promise to reverse the city's decay.

Three U.S. soldiers have been reportedly killed by an IED in Afghanistan (stock image) Earlier this week, eleven people, including election monitors, were killed when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb in the country's north the day after the presidential runoff. Sediq Azizi, spokesman for the provincial governor in Samangan province, said on Sunday that a minibus hit an IED the night before, with the blast killing six women, one child and four men in the provincial capital Aybak. Azizi said four of the victims were employees of the country's election commission, which organized Saturday's vote. In a separate incident, the Taliban cut off the fingers of 11 civilians on Saturday in western Herat province to punish them for voting in the presidential runoff, police spokesman Raoud Ahamdi said. The Taliban had warned people not to participate in the vote.

"By . Louise Boyle . The CIA's barrage of drones and operatives to take on al Qaeda in Pakistan also had a more novel tactic - a secret shipment of custom-made Osama bin Laden dolls with faces which melted into a demonic mask. The agency secretly began developing the 12-inch doll in 2005 which had a painted face, made in a heat-dissolving material, designed to flake off and reveal a red-faced bin Laden with glowing green eyes and black facial stripes. The plan had one aim - to frighten children and their parents into staying away from bin Laden and his terrorist network. The CIA planned to make an Osama bin Laden doll (left) back in 2005 with a dissolving mask which turned him into the devil (right). The plan was to send shipments of the doll to Pakistan to turn locals away from al Qaeda . One of the three bin Laden prototypes of the doll that the CIA developed with a toymaker in China . The project's code name was 'Devil Eyes', a source told The Washington Post. The CIA worked with renowned toymaker Donald Levine to make the bin Laden doll. Mr Levine was the mastermind behind the beloved G.I. Joe which made more than $5billion for company Hasbro. Mr Levine, who served in the Army in Korea, said he got the idea for the moveable G.I. Joe figure as a way to honor veterans. According to The Post, the CIA turned to Mr Levine because he had a sprawling network of contacts in Chinese manufacturing where the dolls were to be made. He had the ability to have the dolls made in a discreet way, The Post reported. Mr Levine died last month aged 86 after a battle with cancer. Three prototypes of the doll were made by superimposing bin Laden's head on a standard 12-inch doll figure that was already being made in the city of Dongguan. Using widely-circulated images of bin Laden, a Chinese artist painted a doll face to look like the 9/11 perpetrator. The doll was dressed in traditional robes and housed in a cheap cardboard box. Prototypes of an Osama bin Laden action figure doll, seen here are two sample heads. The final version had an unusual feature. The faces of the figures were painted with a heat-dissolving material, designed to peel off and reveal a red-faced bin Laden who looked like a demon . It is unclear how many bin Laden . dolls were finally made but one source said a shipment of hundreds had . made it into Karachi, Pakistan's capital. The project was finally shelved - but at least one of the dolls is believed to remain at CIA headquarters in Washington D.C. In a statement to MailOnline, CIA spokesperson K. J. Caldwell said: 'The action figure idea was proposed . and rejected by CIA before it got past the prototype stage. 'To our . knowledge, there were only three individual action figures ever created and . these were merely to show what a final product might look like. 'After . being presented with these examples, the CIA declined to pursue this idea and . did not produce or distribute any of these action figures. Furthermore, CIA has no knowledge of these action figures being produced . or distributed by others.' Hasbro executive Don Levine, who created the beloved G.I. Joe action figure, was called upon by the CIA to use his expertise when it came to making the Osama bin Laden doll. Mr Levine passed away last month aged 86 .","The agency secretly began developing the .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Some residents of a South Florida community were dumbfounded Thursday night to come home to a 12-foot python waiting to greet them. Juan Rivero and his 12-year-old son found the colossal constrictor at the entrance to Gateway Estates Park in Florida City after an evening bike ride. Together with a friend who lives nearby, the group managed to corral the creature into a neighbor's barbecue grill. Humungous! A 12-foot python slithered into a Florida barbecue grill on Thrusday . 'I jumped off the bike and I ran. I was scared. I’ve never seen that before,' Rivero’s son told WFOR. His father concurred. 'I didn’t dare to touch it. It was pretty big,' said Rivero. They knew their family friend Daryl Brooks knew a thing or two about snakes, so they brought her in to help. Though, Brooks was expecting something a lot smaller. 'It was huge. I said, ""Oh my God, it’s a python!"" and the head was bigger than my hand,' she said.

Fighter: The Burmese python put up a good fight but they eventually managed to wrangle it into a barbecue grill . Brooks' surprise didn't stop her from diving right into a struggle with the beast, however. She enlisted the help of another man from the neighborhood and together they tag teamed the snake. 'I pulled the barbecue grill back and they got it out and we wrestled it, and it tried to wrap around the man’s arm and stuff, but we held it,' Brooks told WFOR. They managed to pull the snake out of the barbecue grill, but their struggle wasn't quite over. The pillow case they first tried to use to trap the snake simply wasn't large enough. 'The tail just went in the pillow case,' joked Rivero. Instead, the group improvised and turned the barbecue's plastic cover into a temporary holding tank for the python. A half hour or so later, Florida wildlife authorities arrived to haul the snake away to be turned over to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Its own prison: The group of amateur snake handlers first tried holding the snake in a pillowcase but it was just too small so they used the cover on the barbecue grill to trap the animal until wildlife authorities arrived .","Juan Rivero and 12-year-old his son of Florida City, Florida wrangled the snake with the help of nearby resident Daryl Brooks .

Before shocked friends and all the spectators of the event, which challenges drivers to plow as quickly as possible through a mud pit, Jared and Taylor traded I Do's in the back of a pick-up. I do the mud! Jared Baylor and Taylor Ratcliff got married in a mud pit on Sunday . According to WIBW, the couple had managed to keep the wedding, which took place just east of Wichita, a secret until the last minute. The processional began as Jared drove his pickup truck into the center of the competition mud pit. Instead of plowing ahead like a competitor, though, he stopped short. With a little help, Taylor--with her classic white dress hiked up and a fistful of autumn-colored flowers--managed to climb into the back of the truck.

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Tennessee couple among the 100,000-plus people in the state left uninsured because of a gap left by Obamacare and Medicaid have separated in order to stay covered. Linda and Larry Drain of Maryville have moved apart because couples whose household makes less than $15,510 don't qualify for Affordable Care Act subsidies and Tennessee, like most Southern states, has refused to expand Medicaid to fill in the gap. Debilitated by epilepsy and dependent on pricey medications, going uninsured is not an option for Linda. Now staying healthy means not getting to see her husband of 33 years every day. Sad: Larry Drain, left, and his wife Linda are some of the 100,000-plus Tennesseans who make too little money for Obamacare subsidies but for whom the state refuses to extend Medicaid benefits. To keep her Medicaid, Linda--who requires pricey epilepsy medications--separated from her husband of 33 years . Trouble began for the Drains when 62-year-old Larry decided to retire early last year. 'In September of last year, I made what looking back on it in retrospect was the worst decision I ever made in my entire life,' he told the Tennesseean. 'I decided to take early retirement from Social Security.' But the fault doesn't lie solely with the Drains. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the part of the Affordable Care that required states to expand Medicaid for people like them. And Tennessee, where a Medicaid expansion failed miserably in the 1990s, and Republican Governor Bill Haslam have been unwilling to expand the program in the wake of the court's decision. Like an estimate one in three people in the South, where nearly 4 million of the uninsured fall into the coverage gap, the Drains evidently didn't understand that Linda's eligibility would change with their drop in income. Sticky situation: The Affordable Care Act originally required states to expand Medicaid to those who make too little to qualify for subsidies, but like most Southern states, Tennessee refused once that provision of the health care law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court . But that's precisely what happened and illness-plagued Linda was threatened with the possibility of losing her Supplemental Security Income and the state Medicaid benefits that go along with it. 'After one or two months of crying and lots of prayers and lots of yelling and screaming, on Dec. 26 — after 33 years of marriage — we separated,' Larry told the Tennesseean. The couple now live two miles apart, with Linda at her mother's house and Larry at the apartment they once shared, and don't see each other every day. While Linda has kept her coverage, Larry remains uninsured. 'The irony of it was I was working full time at a hospital with no benefits,' he said. 'When I got the job, what they explained to me was the hospital was losing money hand over fist because of uncompensated care.' The now-retired social worker now writes a letter to the governor via his blog each day, pleading for a Medicaid expansion. 'In some ways, it is like a virtual sit-in,' he said. 'I couldn't go sit in his office, but in some way I need to say, ""I am here. I am going to be here. I'm going to talk about things you don't want talked about.""'","Linda and Larry Drain make too little money to qualify for a subsidy to help cover their insurance premiums .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A severely ill little girl who suffers up to 60 seizures a day is given daily doses of cannabis by her parents, who claim the drug eases her condition. Two-year-old Larisa Rule suffered brain damage when she was born, leaving her partially blind and deaf, and with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. From just two days old she started having up to 60 uncontrollable seizures a day - some lasting more than an hour. Doctors tried almost everything to stop the convulsions - which they warned would soon stop her brain from growing - and even considered brain surgery. Jaylene Siery and her partner Peter Rule give their two-year-old daughter Larisa, second left, daily doses of cannabis claiming the drug helps ease her seizures . Two-year-old Larisa, suffered brain damage when she was born, leaving her partially blind and deaf, and with cerebral palsy and epilepsy . But when nothing worked her parents Jaylene Siery and Peter Rule discovered that a daily dose of liquid cannabis had helped other children like Larisa. They found a man on the internet who grows the plant for the sole purpose of helping poorly people and within just a day of trying it Larisa was having just five seizures a day. Miss Siery, 22, said: 'People tell me I’m a terrible mother and they say things like ""you wouldn’t give your daughter heroin"". 'But little do they realise, most of the medicines the doctors gave us before had opium in - the same plant heroin is derived from. 'I’m not a bad mother, I want nothing but good for my child. 'She was in pain, she was suffering, and I tried everything before I tried this. 'Sadly, my miracle treatment is illegal and in administering it to my daughter three times a day, I’m breaking the law. I risk prison.' Larissa was born in Gosforth Hospital in New South Wales, Australia, suffering from diabetes and with her cord wrapped round her neck. Her mother claims it left her with feeding problems, causing a low blood sugar, leading to seizures which further damaged her brain and caused more convulsions and epilepsy. Doctors tried countless anti-convulsant treatments but none worked and many had terrible side effects including painful rashes, breathing problems and a soaring heart rate. Some conventional treatments made her lose her appetite all together while others made her gain so much weight her devastated parents found it hard to lift her. Larisa used to suffer up to 60 seizures a day, but her mother claims since giving the toddler doses of cannabis she now suffers five fits a day . Miss Siery said: 'I'm not a bad mother, I want nothing but good for my child. She was in pain, she was suffering, and I tried everything before I tried this' The use of medical marijuana and pure cannabidiol - an active substance in the cannabis plant - for neurologic conditions is controversial. Cannabidiol, or CBD, has medicinal properties, but does not provide the 'high' associated with the drug. It is thought the CBD quiets the excessive electrical and chemical activity in the brain that causes seizures. Research carried out at Denver Health Medical Centre in the U.S. discusses a child with a severe form of epilepsy given cannabis in conjunction with anti-epileptic medication. The child went from suffering 50 convulsions a day to around night-time convulsions per month, doctors say. However some research has suggested that medical marijuana, when given to epilepsy patients, can cause anxiety, schizophrenia and addiction. Medical marijuana has also been used to treat people with MS, post-traumatic stress disorder and nerve pain. It is also used to alleviate nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients. Mother-of-two Miss Siery, said: 'Prescribed drugs made her blood vessels swell and burst in her face. 'Her throat swelled and she needed a feeding tube. It felt hopeless - all these horrible drugs and side effects, yet still 60 horrific seizures a day. 'It was very difficult. You just want to take your new baby home and enjoy them, but we couldn’t do that.' But while researching other options, Larisa’s father Mr Rule, a painter and decorator, heard other children like Larisa had been helped by marijuana. Full-time carer Miss Siery asked her doctors about medical cannabis but after they laughed at her she took to the internet to find a supplier on the internet. Now a man called Peter sends them 250ml of cannabis tincture a month - a liquid made by soaking the cannabis flowers, leaves, or stems in ethyl alcohol to create a medicine. He does not charge for the medicine - which Larisa has been taking in her bottles since December - and only supplies to the parents of poorly children. Miss Siery said: 'We’d watch helplessly as she suffered up to 60 seizures a day, some lasting as long as an hour. Larissa was born in Gosforth Hospital in New South Wales, Australia, suffering from diabetes and with her cord wrapped round her neck. Her parents have to give her a host of medicines, right, each day . 'But the first day Larisa had the cannabis tincture, she went from 60 seizures to five, and they only lasted one minute. 'She was more alert, she could move about, she had an appetite. 'The difference is it has given her a life which she never had. She is awake more, we’ve got her off the opiate medication, and we have had to go to hospital since we tried it. 'She also hasn’t suffered any more brain damage.' But her 'dealer' has been charged with cultivating and growing marijuana and is due in court next month, where he could be given a prison sentence. Desperate Miss Siery faces having to find another way to get the medicine for her daughter - or watch her go back to having 60 seizures a day. 'Without him, there are 200 families like us who will be without our medicine,' she said. 'I don’t know what we’ll do if he goes to prison. 'If we can’t keep accessing cannabis tincture it means that Larisa’s seizures will kill her. 'Giving our daughter marijuana is the best option. It’s our only hope.'","Larisa Rule suffered brain damage when she was born, leaving her partially blind and deaf, and with cerebral palsy and epilepsy .

But a year on, Mrs Chadwick has started university - and married at the registry office where she collapsed. She said: 'I wanted to turn a bad thing into a positive and we decided to get married at the same time I felt ill and in the registry office where I collapsed. 'It may seem odd but it was important to turn it around and make happy memories there. Mrs Chadwick, who is also mother to three-year-old Corey, said: 'It wasn’t just me and my husband who suffered when I was poorly, it was our boys and all of our family. 'I wanted them to have a chance to see us happy and put it all behind us.

A year on, she has made a remarkable recovery and married partner Chris, 29 . She said: 'When I first collapsed it was all a blur. I had only given birth 10 days before and could never have guessed I could be so seriously unwell. 'Chris and I walked to the registry office to sort the birth of Casper, but when I got there I felt really dizzy and collapsed. 'Luckily there was a doctor there registering his own child’s birth and he called me an ambulance because I kept losing consciousness and went grey.' Doctors found a large blood clot blocking Mrs Chaswick’s pulmonary artery. This had  cut off the blood supply to her heart - triggering four heart attacks. Blood thinning drugs failed to work, causing blood to pour from Mrs Chadwick's mouth and ears, she claims. Despite her slim chances, she recovered after doctors placed her in an induced coma. She said: 'When I came out of the coma I couldn’t talk or feed myself and I would just dribble. 'Chris was amazing and nursed me back to health. All of our family came round to help look after the boys.' Doctors still do not know what caused Mrs Chadwick’s clots but believe it could be a genetic mutation which affects five in every 100 people, causing her to be more susceptible to clotting. She said: 'Before this happened to me I wasn’t . aware that I was prone to clotting, so I just want other pregnant . mothers to be aware this can happen - and to get checked out if they . don’t feel right.

Dale Zaporowski, now 12, underwent life-saving surgery and rounds of gruelling treatment before suffering a relapse three years later when doctors discovered another brain tumour. Today his mother Jacqui Zaporowski, 52, urged parents to trust their instincts after being told by four different doctors 'nothing was wrong'. She said: 'I knew there was something serious wrong with Dale when he was six as he was vomiting every morning. Dale Zaporowski, now 12, was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of six. His mother Jacqui Zaporowski took him to see four different doctors, eight times and was repeatedly told 'nothing was wrong' Dale, pictured with his parents David and Jacqui Zaporowski, had a life-saving operation to removing a 4cm tumour at the back of his head. Having recovered well from treatment at the age of six, he suffered a setback when in 2011 doctors revealed he had had a relapse, after finding a 3cm long tumour . 'I took him to the doctor eight times in four months but they kept saying there was nothing wrong. 'I was made to feel like I was being an over-protective and silly mum. 'I . would urge any parent in the same situation when they know in their . heart that something is wrong with their child to trust their instincts . and go to A&E.' Mrs Zaporowski,  who lives in Preston, Lancashire, with Dale, her husband David, and their other children Michael, 24, Sadie, 23, and Daniel, 21, said: 'We first noticed that Dale wasn’t eating properly even though he had never been a fussy eater. 'Then Dale began vomiting in the mornings. He was being sick as soon as he woke up and then he was being sick at school as well and they would ring me to tell me. 'I saw four different doctors at the same surgery but I felt they had all spoken to each other  beforehand as before I had even spoken, they seemed to have made their mind up that there was nothing wrong with Dale. 'The doctors made Dale do things like touch his nose, balance on one leg and squeeze their hands and would tell me that everything was fine. 'But we knew there was something wrong. 'Dale was also not eating and it got to the point where all he was eating was cheese and crackers. 'But when I told the doctors this, they just said maybe he was a fussy eater, even though I knew he wasn’t. 'We noticed things like Dale walking down the stairs by just putting one foot forward instead of striding. His balance was also off.' In the end, Mrs Zaporowski took Dale to A&E at Royal Preston Hospital in April 2008. Dale's parents took their son to A&E despite reassurances from doctors that there was nothing wrong. His mother Mrs Zaporowski said repeatedly searching for her son's symptoms on the internet came up with the same answer each time, a brain tumour . After checking the pressure behind Dale’s eyes, they discovered there was a lot of pressure and told his family he needed a CAT scan. Mrs Zaporowski, said: 'It was another week before Dale had the CAT scan and by this time, he was pretty lifeless. 'Within minutes of the CAT scan, a doctor was called and there was shouting saying: ""Get this child blue-lighted"". 'We were in tears. We were terrified but also felt relief that someone was finally listening to us. 'I am just so glad we took Dale to A&E when we did. I think if we had left it any longer we would have lost him' - Dale's mother, Jacqui Zaporowski . 'I had known deep down that there was something serious wrong with Dale even though the doctors kept telling me there wasn’t. 'I had been Googling all his symptoms and I kept coming back with a brain tumour.' Dale had emergency MRI scans at Pendlebury, the former children’s hospital in Manchester, and specialists told his family they had found something abnormal. They found a huge mass at the back of Dale’s head and performed lifesaving surgery to remove a 4cm brain tumour. Mrs Zaporowski, said: 'The surgery took hours and afterwards, the doctors told us everything had gone well. 'Dale was unable to move, speak, see, swallow or communicate in any way. 'It soon became apparent that Dale could not do anything apart from breathe. Mrs Zaporowski has urged other parents to trust their instincts as she did with her son, adding: 'I am just so glad we took Dale to A&E when we did. I think if we had left it any longer we would have lost him' 'Doctors told us time would tell and that Dale would improve, but they could not say to what level. 'But Dale has amazed us all and he continues to amaze us every day. Doctors thought his speech might be impaired, but it has not.' Symptoms caused by increased pressure in the skull: . Headaches - a dull and constant pain that sometimes gets worse when the person coughs, sneezes or bends over. The headache may be worse at night. Nausea - this may be worst in the morning, it may also get worse if the person suddenly changes position. Seizures - some people may experience muscle spasms such as the twitching of an arm or leg. Sometimes a person also briefly loses consciousness. Drowsiness - some people with brain tumours sleep more and fall asleep during the day. Vision and balance problems - changes to the sight, such as blurred vision, confusion and balance problems. Symptoms caused by the position of the tumour: . Changes in personality and intellect . Speech problems, loss of sense of smell, weakness in one side of the body . Facial weakness, difficulty swallowing and a one-sided smileSource: Macmillan Cancer Support . Dale underwent 15 months of chemotherapy and six weeks of radiotherapy. The cancer had spread down his spine and he was fed through a gastrostomy for about 18 months and had intensive physiotherapy every day. However, just as the 12-year-old’s family began thinking the worst was over, in April 2011, doctors discovered Dale had suffered a relapse. His mother recalled: 'I received a telephone call from the hospital asking me to go in the next day without Dale to speak to the consultant. 'I knew straight away that the brain tumour had come back. 'Dale had had an MRI scan only a few days before so I knew it must be bad news. 'Finding out Dale had suffered a relapse was horrendous. 'We had always been given the message that if Dale had a relapse, his chances were not good.' Doctors discovered the second brain tumour was at the front of Dale’s head and was 3cm long. After undergoing further treatment, Mrs Zaporowski said: 'He is now 12 and has his problems as a result of all the treatment he has had, but he is here and he is cancer-free. 'It is only now six years on that we are finally starting to feel some normality. 'I am just so glad we took Dale to A&E when we did. I think if we had left it any longer, we would have lost him. 'It is very difficult as you trust doctors so if they tell you everything is OK, you want to believe them. 'I would encourage any parent to trust their gut instinct and go straight to A&E if you believe there is something serious wrong with your child.'","Dale Zaporowski was six when doctors finally diagnosed his brain tumour .

"By . Sam Peters . Cricket is once again facing up to the spectre of corruption with the recent one-day international series between the West Indies and Pakistan set to be investigated over allegations of wrongdoing. Suspicious betting patterns were identified during the low-profile five-match series, which concluded on Thursday, while unusually slow run-rates during certain overs followed by bursts of high scoring have ‘set alarm bells ringing’, according to industry experts. Concerns have been raised, in particular, around the tied third match of the series played in St Lucia a week ago on Friday, as well as the final game, which resulted in a last-ball win for Pakistan on Thursday. Investigation: Pakistan celebrate winning the five-match series . Danish Kaneria: Pakistan leg-spinner banned for life by ECB in June 2012. Found guilty of 'pressurising' Mervyn Westfield into accepting cash to concede a number of runs in game against Durham . Mervyn Westfield: Essex bowler banned from first-class cricket until 2017. Jailed for four months for spot-fixing in a one-day game against Durham in 2009. Can play club cricket next year . The second ODI, which saw Pakistan fail to score a run off the bat in the first five overs after being set 233 to win, will also be looked at. One betting website reported unusually large sums of money — said to run into several millions of pounds — being wagered between innings on a tied result during the third ODI after the West Indies were set 230 to win from 50 overs. Pakistan appeared to be cruising to victory, with their opponents still requiring 45 off the last 21 balls and only three wickets left. But with the tail-enders scoring at more than four times the rate of most of their team-mates, West Indies scraped the unlikeliest of ties. Field placings for the final over, when No 11 Jason Holder and fellow tail-ender Kemar Roach crashed 14 off six balls from Wahab Riaz, will be scrutinised by officers of the ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU), along with a failed run-out bid off the last delivery. Baffling: The field placings of captain Misbah (left) have been called into question . Television commentator Ian Bishop, the former West Indies fast bowler, said at the time: ‘There is no way, no way, that you can convince me, whatever happens to this last ball, that Wahab Riaz and Misbah ul Haq have had this field right to the length they have been trying to execute. There is no one who can convince me of that. Totally wrong.’ The fifth ODI, which saw Pakistan win by four wickets off the final ball, is also to be scrutinised. ACSU officers will also analyse patterns on spread-betting sites around the first 18 balls of the West Indies innings when only one run was scored. ‘There were suspicious betting patterns on a betting exchange,’ said betting expert Ed Hawkins, the author of Bookie, Gambler, Fixer, Spy. ‘A suspicious pattern, simply, is a flood of money wagered on an outcome just before it happens. There were some noticeable examples of this during the West Indies-Pakistan series. In the tied match, a weight of cash arrived on the tie market before Pakistan’s innings.’ Another passage of play, between the 29th and 34th overs, when experienced West Indies batsmen Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels were at the crease, will also be analysed in an effort to understand why just two runs were scored from five overs before 16 were hit off the 35th over. Putting the brakes on: Marlon Samuels (above) slowed things down batting with Gayle . ACSU investigators, who have been criticised in the past for failing to root out deep-seated corruption in cricket, will analyse betting patterns around those overs amid concerns that anyone with prior knowledge could have made a certain profit in the market for run predictions, which are usually based on totals in five-over ‘brackets’. The same process will occur for the second ODI. In May 2008, Samuels was suspended for two years. The West Indies Board said he had ‘received money, benefit or other reward which could bring him or the game into disrepute’. They looked into charges that Samuels had passed on team information to a bookmaker during a one-day series in India in January 2007, which he denied. Key to any investigation will be to establish a link between illegal bookmakers, normally working on behalf of billionaire businessmen in India or the Middle East, and the players. The ACSU have the power to access a player’s bank records and analyse mobile phone data. Deleted text messages can be accessed through improved data retrieval methods. ‘Players know we are on the look-out for wrongdoing, but they also know it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack,’ said an ICC source. The ICC and their constituent governing bodies have introduced education programmes in recent years to warn players of the dangers of getting involved with the murky underworld of black-market betting and reminding them of the potential punishments if they are caught. The ECB have looked to identify so-called ‘court-siders’ at county games who have the opportunity to interact with players, potentially garnering information about pitch conditions and teams. Strict limits on the processing of mobile data at county grounds have also been implemented in an effort to stop ‘court-siders’ passing real-time information on to bookies. Last week, two individuals were ejected from the T20 game between Northants and Somerset at Wantage Road after being caught by ECB anti-corruption officials phoning live commentary to the sub-continent. The nine-second time delay between live action and the TV broadcast in India is enough for ‘market manipulation’. The ECB say there have been 17 incidents this season, with 14 individuals removed from 13 different county grounds and they are putting pressure on broadcasters to reduce the gap between real-time action and when it is broadcast ‘live’. In the spotlight: County Championship games have seen 14 individuals removed this year . Banned: Pakistani trio (left to right) Mohammad Aamer, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif were found guilty of spot-fixing in a Test match against England at Lord's in August 2010 . Indian Premier League . The tournament has been shrouded in controversy since its inception and, in May this year, its reputation hit a new low when three players — Sree Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan — were arrested on suspicion of spot-fixing. So far 11 bookmakers and other associates have been arrested. One of those held in Mumbai was actor Virender ‘Vindoo’ Dara Singh. He led the police to Meiyappan Gurunath, a top official of Chennai Super Kings and son-in-law of Board of Cricket Control in India president N Srinivasan.Bangladesh Premier League . Another lucrative Twenty20 event engulfed by controversy. In May the ICC began investigating the tournament, and some English players and umpires who took part in the BPL have since been questioned, while Dhaka captain Mohammad Ashraful has admitted his part in fixing a game. The Bangladesh Cricket Board hired the ICC’s anti-corruption team for an investigation in 2013 after Shariful Haque, a former international spinner, was found guilty of spot-fixing in the 2012 competition and was then banned indefinitely. County cricket . Mervyn Westfield’s conviction for spot-fixing in Essex’s CB40 game against Durham in 2010 brought the reality of corruption to the heart of English cricket. A 2011 game between Kent and Sussex remains the subject of a continuing investigation. With more county cricket now being televised in India, and a rise of ‘mercenary’ players moving from one global tournament to another with little or no team loyalty, the threat of corruption has arguably never been greater. In May, six illegal bookmakers were arrested by Indian police for their alleged role in fixing matches during the lucrative Indian Premier League. Since then, liquidity in the Betfair market, largely driven by money from cricket-obsessed India, has dropped ‘dramatically’, according to one industry insider. ACSU investigators face a tough job to establish a link between on-field behaviour and insider trading. Many markets are almost impossible to track, with trades carried out  illegally in India and the Middle East. The ICC are expected to request more detailed information from legitimate bookmakers to try to identify potential wrong-doing surrounding West Indies v Pakistan, though with many online firms registered offshore for tax purposes, they are not obliged to provide information on their customers’ activity. Spot of bother: Indian bowler Sreesanth is caught up in fixing claims . A ‘memorandum of understanding’ exists between sites such as Betfair but they do not come under the remit of the Gambling Act, which requires high street bookmakers in the UK to notify the publically owned Gambling Commission as well as the respective governing body of any suspicious behaviour. The ICC’s anti-corruption unit were approached for an official statement but replied: ‘It is our policy not to comment on any investigtion, ongoing or otherwise.’ Betfair declined to comment, while a Pakistan Cricket Board spokesman said: ‘We have no knowledge of an ICC investigation.’ The West Indies Board were unavailable for comment.","West indies-Pakistan series to be investigated .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A nurse is facing a mastectomy after refusing to challenge her doctor's opinion when her concerns over breast cancer were dismissed. Rika Turner did not want to 'overstep the boundaries' by questioning her GP, despite suspecting something was wrong. The 38-year-old went to see a doctor last year, after feeling tenderness in her breast. The mother-of-one from Gloucester was reassured there was nothing sinister to blame, but despite suspecting that was not the case, Ms Turner accepted her doctor's opinion. Scroll down for video . Nurse Rika Turner is facing a mastectomy after a doctor dismissed her breast cancer fears, only to find she had a cancerous lump months later. The mother-of-one said she didn't want to 'be a nuisance' by 'challenging' her GP's opinion . She said she 'didn't want to be a nuisance', and so did not raise doubts. But months later when she raised the problem with her GP she was referred for a scan, which revealed a cancerous lump in her breast. She now faces a mastectomy to remove all the breast tissue, to try and stop the disease spreading. She said: 'My doctor couldn’t feel anything and, although I did, I didn’t want to be a nuisance. 'I . thought the doctor knows best. As a nurse, I didn’t want to overstep . any boundaries by making a self diagnosis or assumptions and I therefore . put my trust in someone of a higher level of education than myself. 'Nobody . wants to think they’ll ever be diagnosed with cancer. I put it to the . back of my mind because I felt reassured by my GP initially.' Ms Turner, who is mother to five-year-old Erica, first noticed her breast was tender last February. She suspected it was hormone-related but went to see her doctor when she felt a lump a few weeks later. Ms Turner said: ''I thought the doctor knows best. As a nurse, I didn¿t want to overstep any boundaries by making a self diagnosis or assumptions and I therefore put my trust in someone of a higher level of education than myself.' Pictured is breast cancer cells under the microscope . After initially being told there was nothing wrong, she raised the issue again several months later when she visited her GP about another matter. It was then she was referred for a scan. 'I already knew it was positive from the look on the radiographer’s face,' she said. The South African native was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent surgery to remove the cancer, which was orginally 2cm but had spread 5cm. She is due to undergo a mastectomy later in the year and recently took part in Cancer Research’s Race for Life in Cheltenham. 'It was the first time I had taken part in Race for Life. It made me feel good to be part of something positive,' she said. 'I would not be where I am today without the research Race for Life helps to pay for.'","Nurse Rika Turner, 38, first felt tenderness in her breast last February .
