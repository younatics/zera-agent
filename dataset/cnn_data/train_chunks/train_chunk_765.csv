Controversial comments: Jockey Ruby Walsh, pictured Tuesday, said 'you can replace a horse' after race death . A star jockey prompted outrage yesterday by playing down the death of a horse during a big race. After spectators and TV viewers watched in horror as Our Conor suffered a fatal fall at the Cheltenham Festival, Ruby Walsh said the animal was replaceable. The 34-year-old Irishman said: ‘Horses are horses. You can replace a horse’. The comments by Walsh, who has twice won the Grand National, provoked a furious response from animal rights campaigners. They described his words as callous and lacking respect for the horse. Mr Walsh, who reached a record 40 wins at the Festival after a double-victory yesterday, added: ‘It’s sad, but horses are animals, outside your back door. Humans are humans. They are inside your back door. ‘You can replace a horse. You can’t replace a human being. That’s my feeling on it.’ The comments sparked fury from animal rights campaigners and are likely to reignite the debate over whether horse-racing is an unnecessarily cruel sport. Campaign group Animal Aid said that Mr Walsh had ‘no respect’ for the animals that have brought him success. Horse-racing consultant Dene Stansall said: ‘He has shown callousness for the animals that have earned him a good living. ‘It’s completely disrespectful. To treat the death of a horse in such a way shows that they are merely machines for people to make money. ‘Ruby Walsh is the leading jockey at Cheltenham and wants to support the event as much as he can, but you cannot disregard the lives of horses just because they are not humans. ‘We would expect more from him. This shows he has got little empathy for a horse that really suffered before it died.’ Tragedy: Our Conor, right ridden by jockey Daniel Mullins, suffered a fatal fall during The Festival Champion Day at Cheltenham Racecourse on Tuesday . Our Conor fell as he ran in the main race of the day, the Champion Hurdle. The five-year-old, which is thought to have been sold for one million euros last year, slammed into the ground as he contested the lead with Captain Cee Bee at a furious pace. Screens were put around the horse as he was treated by vets, but officials later announced that he had been put down. They said: ‘Our Conor was attended by vets immediately and they did everything possible to save him. After extensive treatment for a back injury, the decision was made to humanely put the horse down.’ Campaigners have complained about the Festival and claimed the race-course is the most lethal in the country. According to Animal Aid, 48 horses have lost their lives there since March 2007, with 15 deaths at the Festival. In 2012, five horses died in just two days. They say the Festival puts horses under enormous pressure due to its big and noisy crowds and also warn that many of the races feature too many horses, making it difficult for the animals to judge their jumps. 'Lacking respect': Ruby Walsh, seen after taking a record sixth Mares' Hurdle title at the Cheltenham Festival on Tuesday, was attacked by animal rights activists . Last night the British Horseracing Association said: ‘The welfare of the sport’s equine and human participants is paramount to British Horseracing and remains the over-riding priority for all those involved with the staging of the Cheltenham Festival. ‘Cheltenham Racecourse employs eight veterinary surgeons, whose sole responsibility it is to provide care to the horses throughout their time at the racecourse. ‘In the event of an incident on the racecourse any horse affected will receive immediate attention and treatment from the racecourse’s veterinary team. ‘Qualified paramedics and doctors are also on hand in the case of any incident involving a jockey. ‘If necessary, horses and riders will be transported from the course to receive further treatment at the most appropriate equine hospital or Accident & Emergency hospital. ‘British Racing is open and transparent about the risks involved in the sport - the BHA Veterinary team monitors injury rates at every licensed racecourse. Over the last 15 years the equine fatality rate has fallen by one third to 0.2% of all runners. ‘Despite the best efforts of all involved, as with participation in any sport involving speed and athleticism, there remains an inherent risk of injury.’ It said that campaign groups such as Animal Aid are not welfare organisations, but ‘extremists’. Mr Walsh, from Kildare in the Republic of Ireland, yesterday led Vautour to victory in the opening race of the Festival, romping home with six lengths clear. He later scored a second win on Quevega in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle Race. The jockey won the Gold Cup on Kauto Star at the Festival in 2007 and 2009.","Jockey Ruby Walsh said  'you can replace a horse' after death during race .

Victim: Cpl Geoffrey McNeill was found dead at his Army barracks on Saturday morning . A 23-year-old soldier has been charged with murdering a corporal who was found dead at an Army barracks four days ago. Richard Farrell was today remanded in custody over the death of Geoffrey McNeill, of the 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment. The corporal's body was discovered in an accommodation block at Clive Barracks in Tern Hill, Shropshire on Saturday morning. Farrell - a member of the same battalion - has been in custody at Shrewsbury police station since he was arrested two hours after Cpl McNeill was found dead. Today he appeared at Telford Magistrates' Court, where he spoke only to confirm his name and address, and was ordered to be remanded in custody. There were reports of two soldiers fighting during a night out hours before Cpl McNeillâ€™s body was found. An Army spokesman said: 'We can confirm that a serving soldier has been charged with murder by West Mercia Police. It would be inappropriate to comment any further at this stage.' After the unmarried corporal's death, his family said: 'Geoff was born in Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, and dedicated his life to the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment,' he said. 'He served his country with the highest degree of honour and dedication. 'He was a much-loved son, brother, uncle and friend and touched the lives of all who had the pleasure of meeting him.

'The family would like to give thanks for . the continued support of the Army, police and all who knew and loved . Geoff. Our love for him remains as strong as ever. Rest in peace . soldier. Faugh a Ballagh.' Cpl McNeill is from the same battalion deployed last month to help flood-stricken communities in Worcestershire, after record amounts of rain fell across the UK. Members of the unit met David Cameron at Upton-upon-Severn on February 17, when the Prime Minister was touring some of the county's flood defences. During that visit, Mr Cameron praised the soldiers' efforts in using their troop carriers to set up a shuttle bus service to get people from one side of the flooded river to the other, while residents also expressed their delight at the military's presence. Although it can trace its origins back to 1688, the Royal Irish Regiment formed in 1992 when the Royal Irish Rangers was merged with the Ulster Defence Regiment. The 1st Battalion, based at Tern Hill, Shropshire, is a light role battalion, rotating with two other line infantry/rifles battalions in the air assault role as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade. The Regiment recruits from all sections of the Northern Irish community, on both sides of the sectarian divide. In September 2008 the battalion completed a tour in Afghanistan and it became the first unit in the Army to receive three Conspicuous Gallantry Crosses in a single operation . Base: The entrance to Clive Barracks, where the 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment is headquartered . Barracks: The base is known for being targeted by IRA terrorists in February 1989 . Recently troops from the battalion deployed to Mali in support of the EU training mission and the most recent battalion size operational deployment was in 2011 as part of Operation HERRICK 13 in Afghanistan. The slogan of the regiment is 'Faugh a Ballagh', an Irish battle cry meaning 'Clear the way'. Clive Barracks opened in 1916 and has been home to 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment since 2007 when the battalion moved from Fort George, Inverness. The barracks hit the headlines on February 20, 1989 after a pair of IRA terrorists activated two bombs within the accommodation block.

A baby monkey narrowly avoided becoming leopard lunch in the South African bush, after the hungry predator started playing games. The young monkey was resting in a marula tree when the female leopard attacked, but despite catching the primate on at least three occasions, she kept setting it free to continue the playful chase. Scroll down for video . Grabbing dinner: The leopard locks eyes with its primate prey and prepares to jump for its throat - or so the monkey thinks . The pair played ‘cat-and-monkey’ for close to three hours, before it came to an end. However, as the leopard was getting ready for game over, the tiny monkey managed to escape from the tree by bravely leaping from a tree and scurrying off into nearby reeds.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho spent £32million in eight days to bring the pair of them to Stamford Bridge to strengthen his title bid - and so far the plan is working. Since £21m was spent bringing Serbia midfielder Nemanja Matic back to his former club, Chelsea are unbeaten in their eight Premier League games, winning six, and have opened up a seven point gap at the top of the table. Crucially, in a tricky run of games for the Blues, Matic has been a key part in important wins over Manchester United, Manchester City, Everton and Tottenham. £11m Egyptian Mohamed Salah may not be having the same impact at the moment, but the flying winger has shown huge potential in his three brief appearances. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Matic score an absolute screamer for Benfica . Class: Nemanja Matic has been a revelation in central midfield since returning to the club in January . Flashes: Mohamed Salah hasn't had much chance to show his qualities, but has given Chelsea fans signs of more to come . League leaders: The signings have helped Jose Mourinho open up a seven-point gap at the top of the Premier League . Matic has been a revelation in central midfield, something Chelsea have been missing since the likes of Michael Ballack and Claude Makelele left, and Frank Lampard and Michael Essien's powers declined. He combines brute strength with intelligence and class on the ball and has earned rave reviews, especially for the way he out-played Yaya Toure in that win at the Etihad. His performance that night earned him the nickname 'The Beast.' 'I saw something on the internet which said this about me,' says the 25-year-old in Chelsea Magazine. 'It’s very nice if the people think this about me because it would be a good nickname to have. I have to be like this because I play in a position where you have to be the beast! 'Of course, I am always very happy when people have nice things to say about me, and it’s a pleasure if they like the way I play. I wanted to show my quality and I know it was important to start well because that helped me to feel more comfortable.' The beast: Matic earned rave reviews for his brilliant performance against Yaya Toure at the Etihad . Pedigree: Salah scored three goals in four matches against Chelsea in the last two seasons . Salah has played just 60 minutes of football in west London but has shown his pedigree against Chelsea in recent seasons, with three goals in four appearances against them in his last two seasons. The Egyptian is excited to be playing in England and has memories of watching Chelsea as a teenager. 'As a boy, I watched every Champions League game on the TV and saw many, many good players,' he says. Beast: Matic enjoys mixing it up with his opponents in his defensive midfield roles . Hard fought: Matic battles with Jan Vertonghen during Chelsea's 4-0 win over Spurs on Saturday . 'I remember watching Chelsea play against Liverpool in the Champions League – a 4-4 draw but Chelsea went through. 'It was a really great game and it has been my dream to play in England – the Egyptian people want to see players in the Premier League and now they will see me playing at Chelsea, so there is more pressure on me. 'I hope I can now start to score for Chelsea, not against Chelsea,” he adds. 'I know it will not be easy to play every game for Chelsea because we have so many very good players in my position, but I hope to show how hard I work and then we will see.' Spell away: Matic spent three years at Benfica before returning to Chelsea . Matic, of course, has taken an odd route to the Chelsea first team. After joining the Blues in 2009 from Slovak team MFK Kosice, he stayed at Stamford Bridge for two years making three appearances before moving as part of the deal that brought David Luiz to the club. He flourished in Portugal, helping the Lisbon giants to the Taca da Liga cup and leading them to the Europa League final, where they were beaten by Chelsea. His performances in the midfield won him the Portuguese Player of the Year award. Matic acknowledges that leaving Chelsea may have been the best thing for him. 'I feel different than I felt three years ago,' he says. 'I always believed I had the right qualities and style of play for the Premier League. Maybe if I stayed at Chelsea, I don’t play like I do now – maybe I play better, maybe I play worse, you never know. 'I learned a lot at Benfica, which is one of the biggest clubs in the world; not only how to play that central-midfield position, but I learned to play with pressure. 'Now it is very nice to be back. It’s a pleasure to be part of this team and to work with these players and coaches. All the people have been helping me since I came back and I’m very happy.'

Sophie opted for black cropped trousers and a matching black blazer, which she teamed with white trainers and socks. Despite a lack of sporty attire, 49-year-old Sophie clearly impressed the team. She was even presented with an England Hockey shirt by men's coach Bobby Crutchley and captain Barry Middleton and ladies' coach Jason Lee and woman's Captain Kate Richardson Walsh. The Countess, wife of Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex, has been Royal Patron of England Hockey since 2007 and is also patron of a number of other sports. HRH will no doubt be keen to see the teams’ progress this summer, as they compete for medals at both the Hockey World Cup in the Netherlands in June, and the Commonwealth Games in Scotland, in August.

The terrifying risk of sinkholes opening up without warning has increased in large parts of the world. In the U.S., a sinkhole recently swallowed eight rare cars at a Kentucky sports museum and in the UK, scientists have warned that more sinkholes are expected to swallow up Britain - and perhaps unsuspecting Britons - following the recent flooding. Now Nasa has revealed that its radar data, routinely collected by satellites, may be able to predict these strange geological formations months before they appear. Aerial photo of a sinkhole that formed unexpectedly near Bayou Corne. New analysis of Nasa airborne radar data collected in 2012 reveals the radar detected indications of the sinkhole before it collapsed and forced evacuations . The space agency claims that signs of a sinkhole that is now 25 acres large (10.1 hectares) and growing were caught by its radar before it opened. The technique, while not able to detect all sinkholes, could help spot them in areas where sinkholes are likely to form. Sinkholes are depressions in the ground formed when the Earth’s surface layers collapse into caverns below. They usually form without warning. Nasa made its discovery after analysing data from a special kind of radar aboard a jet flying over the Louisiana coast in 2011 and 2012. The team used an Uninhabited Airborne Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) to measure subtle lumps and holes in Earth's surface. Their study showed the surface layer deformed at least a month before the collapse, moving mostly horizontally up to 10.2 inches (260 mm) toward where the sinkhole would later form . Typically, sinkholes have no natural external surface drainage, and they form through natural processes and human activities. They are usually the result of what are known as Karst processes. They occur when a layer of rock underneath the ground is dissolved by acidic water. In many cases rainfall get through the soil, absorbing carbon dioxide and reacting with decaying vegetation.This causes the water to become acidic. The acidic water causes the erosion of the soluble rock layers beneath the surface - eventually creating a sinkhole. The deepest is China's Xiaozhai Tienkeng at 2172ft (662m). The Qattara Depression in Egypt is roughly 50 miles (80km) by 75 miles (121km) in surface size. The radar detected a huge sinkhole before it collapsed near Bayou Corne. Researchers Cathleen Jones and Ron Blom analysed something known as interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) imagery. This imagery uses an Uninhabited Airborne Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) to measure subtle lumps and holes in Earth's surface. Their study showed the surface layer deformed at least a month before the collapse, moving mostly horizontally up to 10.2 inches (260 mm) toward where the sinkhole would later form. These initial surface movements covered a much larger area - about 1,640 by 1,640 feet, (500 by 500 metres) - than that of the sinkhole, which measured about 2 acres (1 hectare). ‘While horizontal surface deformations had not previously been considered a signature of sinkholes, the new study shows they can precede sinkhole formation well in advance,’ said Ms Jones. A 50ft-deep hole appeared in the central reservation on a section of the M2 in north Kent earlier this year . Nasa made the discovery after looking at data from a jet flown over Louisiana . ‘This kind of movement may be more common than previously thought, particularly in areas with loose soil near the surface.’ The Bayou Corne sinkhole formed unexpectedly in 2012 after weeks of minor earthquakes and bubbling natural gas that provoked community concern. It was caused by the collapse of a sidewall of an underground storage cavity connected to a nearby well operated by Texas Brine Company and owned by Occidental Petroleum. The sinkhole, which filled with slurry - a fluid mixture of water and pulverised solids - has gradually expanded and now measures about 25 acres (10.1 hectares) and is at least 750 feet (229 metres) deep. It is still growing. A sinkhole opened up on February 12 beneath the National Corvette Museum in Kentucky devouring 8 Corvettes . Typically, sinkholes have no natural external surface drainage, and they form through natural processes and human activities. They occur in regions of terrain where the rock below the surface can be dissolved by groundwater, most commonly in areas with limestone or other carbonate rocks, gypsum or salt beds. Nasa said continued radar monitoring of the area as recently as October 2013 has shown a widening area of lower ground, with the potential to affect other nearby storage cavities, . Continued growth of the sinkhole threatens the community and Highway 70, so there is a pressing need for reliable estimates of how fast it may expand and how big it may eventually get. ‘This kind of data could be of great value in determining the direction in which the sinkhole is likely to expand,’ said Ms Jones. ‘At Bayou Corne, it appears that material is continuing to flow into the huge cavern that is undergoing collapse.’ Mr Blom says there are no immediate plans to fly radar over sinkhole-prone areas. ‘You could spend a lot of time flying and processing data without capturing a sinkhole,’ he said. ‘Our discovery at Bayou Corne was really serendipitous. But it does demonstrate one of the expected benefits of an InSAR satellite that would image wide areas frequently.’","Nasa made discovery after looking at data from a jet flown over Louisiana .

The material is now being sold by auctioneers Bonhams, and is expected to be sold for at least £30,000. Among the documents is the original 1938 contract between the Air Ministry, Whittle's firm Power Jets Ltd and BT-H. There are also technical pencil drawings showing the engine as it was developing. What resulted from these first engines was the 'jet age' that would go on to transform air travel. First design: The Gloster Meteor was Britain's first operational jet, and was used by the Allies during WWII . Turbojet: The designs kept by Sporborg led to the production of the first turbine engine, the W2BWelland, which powered the first jet planes . Though Whittle had submitted his first . patent for the jet engine in 1930 it was only eight years later that . the Air Ministry took an interest following the creation of a prototype. In . 1939, the ministry's director of scientific research, David Pye, was . shown a demonstration of the prototype and was totally convinced of its . importance. The ministry . then placed an order for a flyable version and Whittle began work on the . Type W1.The following January the ministry placed an order for a larger . more advanced engine, the W2. Linked: The expansion chamber would be connected to the main jet engine's turbine design . Top secret: Minutes from the meeting where the upgrade from the W2 engine, the first turbine-propelled design, to the more advanced Mark II was discussed . With the Germans developing their own engine, the race was on, and this archive logs the important stages of the development through the early years of World War Two. One letter from David Pye, the air minister, in January 1940, records the moment that the ministry decided the project was valuable. It was written to Sporborg and states: . 'I hope that if you are fully aware of the great importance that the . Air Ministry attach to the development of this Whittle engine you will . take all steps in your power to ensure that no unnecessary delay occurs . in the completion of these engines and that you will do all you can to . assist Power Jets Limited in their work.' Looking to the future: A letter from the Air Ministry urging Sporborg to continue the jet-building programme, which was advancing military aircraft at the time . The . documents also highlight the strain and stresses between the various . parties as they tried to complete the project in time to influence the . war. The jet-powered Gloster Meteor finally entered service with the RAF in July 1944. Matthew . Haley, head of the books and manuscripts department at Bonhams, said: . 'Whittle had offered his idea to the Air Ministry in 1930, but it wasn't . until much later that they become interested, after he had joined with . Sporborg's company to make them. Official g-ahead: A telegram from Air Vice Marshall Tedder belatedly giving permission for Sporborg's engineers to build the prototype jet engines . 'These documents were commercially sensitive and because it happened during the war there was an added level of classification. 'Sporborg saved the documents he deemed important; the cream of the crop. 'When we think of aeroplanes in World War Two we probably think of Spitfires, but not long after the war we entered the jet age because of Whittle's work. The archive will have wide appeal.' While Whittle and BT-H were developing their jet engine, the Germans were also working on their own. Hans von Ohain had started work on a prototype in 1935, and after the war told Whittle: 'If you had been given the money you would have been six years ahead of us. 'If Hitler or Goering had heard that there is a man in England who flies 500mph in a small experimental plane and that it is coming into development, it is likely that World War II would not have come into being.' Innovative: Frank Whittle applied for the first jet engine patent in 1930. He had completed the first prototype by 1937 . The 'Jet Age' saw the development of aircrafts powered by turbine engines, rather than propeller blades or pistons. The term was coined in the 1940s, but most of the early jet planes were military designs rather than commercial. Frank Whittle would lead Britain into Jet Age, producing the first engine in 1937, but he was nearly beaten by a German, who completed his design just five months later. Whittle applied for a patent of his design in 1930, after rising through the RAF ranks from an apprentice mechanic to reporting to the man in charge of the research. His ideas were initially shot down, and his patent ran out in 1935, but some of his colleagues invested in his future ventures. Competition: Whittle was up against German physicist Hans von Ohain in the race to complete the first design . Whittle set up a small company called Power Jets in 1936, which began work on a prototype engine. The same year Hans von Ohain, a young physics and aerodynamics student at . Germany's . University of Göttingen, applied for a patent for a 'Process and . Apparatus for Producing airstreams for Propelling Airplanes.' The race to design the first turbojet engine was on. Whittle was on a shoestring budget while von Ohain, whose family were from the Prussian aristocracy, had a virtually unlimited amount of money. But Whittle made the breakthrough on April 2, 1937, after fitting a simple drainage system to his design to stop fuel from pooling in the combustion chamber. Fighter plane: The Me 262 had a similar design to the Gloster Meteor, but became operational first when it was drafted into the Luftwaffe in 1944 . Two years later, despite ignoring his ideas for years, the Air Ministry tested his prototype and decided they would use it in military aircraft. Many would be used during the Second World War and Whittle was able to pilot his first jet-propelled plane in 1945, reaching 606mph. Hans von Ohain had started work on a . prototype in 1935, and after the war told Whittle: 'If you had been . given the money you would have been six years ahead of us. 'If . Hitler or Goering had heard that there is a man in England who flies . 500mph in a small experimental plane and that it is coming into . development, it is likely that World War II would not have come into . being.' Despite creating the first engine, the Germans produced the first operational jet-powered fighter plane, the Me 262 Schwalbe. Initially it was beset by engine problems, but it became a part of the Luftwaffe in 1944. Whittle's 1928 thesis and 1930 patent had led to a true revolution in . military and civilian air travel. Thirty years after fighters and . bombers had been hard-pressed to exceed 200 mph, their successors were . traveling at 10 times that speed, and long-distance travel times were . halved.","Henry Sporborg's company manufactured engines in the 1930s .

But while policy makers are left scratching their heads, a group of French students believe they have come up with a Waterworld-type solution to make use of the nutrient-rich water. Their concept, dubbed Arctic Harvester, envisions the creation of large villages and towns that float around the Arctic while ‘eating’ icebergs. Arctic Harvester makes use of the abundance of fresh-water icebergs by capturing them with its circular shape. It then uses their nutrient-rich water to grow crops . Arranged in a circular form, the Arctic Harvester floats on the water and delivers icebergs into its central bay. Here, freshwater from the iceberg goes to hydroponic greenhouses to grow fruit and vegetables, which are then delivered to towns along the coast. Solar panels would provide power for both plants and people during the long summer days. Meanwhile an osmotic system, which generates power from a combination of saltwater and freshwater, fills in any energy gaps to power the community. They hope the floating hydroponic communities will help grow local food for Greenland, which currently ships in almost all of its produce from overseas. ‘The floating facility is equipped to house a community of 800 people, inspired in its compact urban form by vertically oriented, bayside Greenlandic villages,’ wrote Meriem Chabani, a student at the École Nationale Supérieure d’Architecture Paris Malaquais. Ms Chabani, who is working alongside fellow students Etienne Chobaux, John Edom, and Maeva Leneveu, told FastCoExist that they were struck by the idea that Greenland's icebergs support such rich localised ecosystems. ‘An iceberg is an oasis,’ she said. ‘We had what seemed to us a massive resource on one hand, and a massive lack - no local produce - on the other.’ The team hope the floating hydroponic communities will help grow local food for Greenland, which currently ships in almost all of its produce from overseas . The circular structure would have room to house 800 people. The largest area is dedicated to collecting water from icebergs. Equipment to transfer the crops to local towns is also stored on board . Arranged in a circular form, the Arctic Harvester floats on the water and delivers icebergs into its central bay. Here, freshwater from the iceberg goes to hydroponic greenhouses to grow fruit and vegetables, which are then delivered to towns along the coast. ‘The central bay is thus the heart of the Harvester’s agricultural process, the centre of its sustainable energy production, as well as an ice garden, offering social spaces and floating communal greenhouses for use by the inhabitants,’ said Ms Chabani. The propeller-less Arctic Harvester would drift with the currents that carry the icebergs, often circling the ocean currents between Greenland and the coast of Labrador.

This is the sentiment surrounding some recent releases of chunky smart watches, unflattering glasses and outrageous jewellery. But one company has decided to shake up the technology and fashion worlds by bringing its wearable technology designs to the catwalk. Scroll down for video… . London-based CuteCircuit has unveiled a new collection of wearable technology outfits that it claims doesn't compromise on fashion . Earlier this month, Francesca Rosella of London-based CuteCircuit sent models strutting down the runway at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. Some of the models had iPhones in their hand, giving them the ability to customise their outfits by making them change colour, glow in the dark and play video. According to NBC News, before the show, one of the models didn’t even realise there was something special about her skirt. Batteries are disguised as buttons or clasps meaning that the designs can be created with traditional fabrics . The outfits can change colour, light up or shimmer using an iPhone app that will be available for download in the near future . Cute Circuit already has celebrity clientele . including  Nicole Scherzinger who famously wore its Twitter dress with . live updates streaming in 2012. The . dress was constructed from eight metres of French silk chiffon, laden . with over 500 Swarovski crystals and over 2,000 LED lights that lit up . with messages from fans. Scherzinger wasn't the first to wear such advanced fashions. Singer Imogen Heap performed at the 2010 Grammy Awards in a dress displaying her Twitter feed, which she said was envisioned as a way to let fans 'accompany me on the red carpet.' What Ms Rosella had hidden was a series of micro-LED lights using conductive nylon ribbon removing the need for wires. The batteries, meanwhile, were disguised as buttons or clasps allowing the clothing to be designed and made with existing fabrics. ‘Everything in our life is completely digital,’ Ms Rosella, said in an interview with NBC News. ‘So why does fashion seem like it’s stuck in the Middle Ages? The most advanced technology on most designs are Velcro and zippers.’ The outfits are connected to a smartphone on a free app via Bluetooth. From there, the user has control of their garment and can alter the colour or pattern. The app, which will be available on the Apple Store in the near future, allows you to control their entire 'smart' wardrobe.

David Trowsdale, 29, was fit as a fiddle when he served in Afghanistan in 2009 - and even guarded the queen on horseback as part of the Royal Cavalry. But after leaving the army in 2010, he piled on the pounds and hit 22 stone. After pals teased him about his weight gain, he vowed to shift the excess weight. David Trowsdale weighed 22 stone when he left the army but has shed almost half his bodyweight - and then coached his girlfriend Laura Stuart to do the same . After leaving the army in 2010, David (left) piled on the pounds and tipped the scales at 22 stone; his girlfriend Laura Stuart (right) weighed 21st 9lb . Now, after being crowned Cambridge Weight Plan's man of the year, he's set up as a weight loss consultant himself - and has helped girlfriend Laura Stuart shed almost 10st too. David, from Harlow, Essex, said: 'I just felt as though I'd gone from hero to zero. 'Being in the army meant I didn't really have to worry too much about what I was eating, and I was doing loads of exercise. 'But as soon as I left, I got a job driving, and the pounds just kept piling on. After being crowned Cambridge Weight Plan's man of the year, David was set up as a weight loss consultant himself - and has helped girlfriend Laura Stuart shed almost 10 stone too . The trigger for David was taunts from his friends about how much weight he had put on - he hit the gym, changed his diet and is a new man . 'One night, I was meeting family and friends in our local pub, and as I walked in, my brother jokingly shouted: ""Look at that fat git!"" 'I wanted the ground to open and swallow me up. I walked out of the pub and drove straight home - vowing there and then to do something about my weight. 'I couldn't believe how much my life had changed. When people saw me in my uniform, they were always impressed - now I was a laughing stock. 'I researched losing weight online and signed up for the Cambridge Weight Plan - within a few days of starting the diet, I'd lost a stone.' Being in the army meant David (pictured, left, in 2009) didn't have to worry too much about what he was eating, and he was doing loads of exercise but when he left the army and began work as a lorry driver, the pounds started to pile on (right) David has found that since losing weight, people come up to him in the gym and ask him what his secret is . David, pictured in Afghanistan in 2009, said: 'It was so easy to put weight on. I was promised all kinds of jobs when I came out of the army, but none of them materialised into anything' Within weeks, David had lost 4st - and after hitting the gym, started to lose even more weight. Now, a year after he started his weightloss plan, he weighs 13st 8lb. And when his girlfriend, Laura Stuart, 24, saw how much weight he'd lost, she signed up last October - and has dropped from a size 22 to a size 12. Laura, 24, saw how much weight her boyfriend had lost so she signed up last October - and has dropped from a size 22 to a size 12 . David said: 'When I first started, I was so fat that I was too embarrassed to go to the gym. 'But after I lost a bit of weight, it got easier, and now, people come up to me while I'm working out and ask me what my secret is. 'It was so easy to put weight on. I was promised all kinds of jobs when I came out of the army, but none of them materialised into anything. 'I got depressed and comfort ate constantly, especially when I started a new job as a lorry driver and was working unsociable hours. 'I also met my girlfriend Laura about the same time. She made me really happy and we moved in together - and we loved cooking meals together - meaning we both put weight on.' After David's weight loss, Laura also signed up - and when David started working as a consultant, his girlfriend was his first client. Within months, Laura had also shed almost 10 stone - going from 21st 9lb to 13st 7lb - and plans to lose another stone. Laura said: 'I'd struggled with my weight all my life - I was always trying this diet or that one, and nothing ever worked. 'When I saw how much weight David had lost and how happy he was though, I knew I had to try it for myself. 'In the first week, I lost 11lb - losing weight has completely changed my life.' David added: 'The first few days of the diet were tough, but once we both started losing weight, it was easy to keep going. David, who lost 11lb in the first week, said losing weight has completely changed his life . Speaking about his weight loss, David said: 'I feel good about myself when I walk into a room of strangers now - not scared of what they would think of me' 'Our friends and family are amazed - they think we look like a completely different couple. 'It's helped us understand our relationship with food and we'll never go back to our old ways. 'Being crowned man of the year was the icing on the cake.

Prince Charles's letters to ministers are set to be made public after a court ruled that the Government could not block their publication. The Attorney General used a ministerial veto to prevent the correspondence being released to a newspaper under freedom of information laws. But today one of the country's most senior judges ruled that he had 'no good reason' to do so, in a landmark decision which could open the floodgates for the release of sensitive information. Attorney General Dominic Grieve has vowed to appeal against the decision at the Supreme Court. The letters are said to reveal how the Prince of Wales lobbies members of the Government on issues such as climate change. The notes concern Charles's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs', according to Mr Grieve. The Guardian requested the publication of the letters under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. In September 2012, a tribunal headed by a High Court judge declared that the letters were subject to the legislation and should be released to the newspaper. But Mr Grieve exercised his right to a veto, arguing that the letter would damage Charles's 'role as future monarch' because they show him 'disagreeing with Government policy'. Today the Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson, and two other judges overturned the veto because Mr Grieve had no reason to defy the tribunal and was acting illegally under European law. The case is believed to mark the first time that anyone has challenged the Attorney General's powers to block access to information, which could restrict the Government's ability to keep documents secret. However, the letters still cannot be published pending the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal. Appeal: Attorney General Dominic Grieve has vowed to fight against the decision to overturn his veto . A spokesman for the Attorney General said: 'We are very disappointed by the decision of the court. 'We will be pursuing an appeal to the Supreme Court in order to protect the important principles which are at stake in this case.' The order relates to 27 letters from Charles to seven different Government departments sent between September 2004 and April 2005. Dinah Rose QC, for the Guardian, argued that Mr Grieve wanted to block their publication simply because he disagreed with the tribunal judges, adding: 'The implications for the rule of law are grave.' Lawyers for the Attorney General told the court that he was entitled 'to take his own view of what was in the public interest'. Ruling: A panel of three judges decided that the letters are subject to freedom of information legislation . But today Lord Dyson ruled: 'The Attorney General did not have reasonable grounds for forming the opinion on which the certificate was based. 'The mere fact that he reached a different conclusion from the Upper Tribunal (UT) in weighing the competing public interests involved was not good enough. 'He had no good reason for overriding the meticulous decision the UT reached after six days of hearing and argument. 'He could point to no error or fact in the UT's decision and the Goverrnment departments concerned did not even seek permission to appeal it. 'The certificate is also unlawful because it is incompatible with EU law.' The decision overturns a ruling by three High Court Judges last year who supported Mr Grieve's right to apply his veto. Prince Charles's office declined to comment on today's ruling.","Prince of Wales sent 27 letters advising ministers on Government policies .

The research was spotted by the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA—later named DARPA), which wanted to use it to distribute academic papers. It wanted to test a network, and a contract was awarded to a team of computer engineers at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), who built the Interface Message Processor, which was similar to the routers still used today. The first node was placed at UCLA. the second at Stanford. That two-node transmission marked the birth of the internet - and thankfully it has become a little more reliable since. The first message was supposed to be 'log in', but their first success also spelled their first failure – the system crashed after the 'L' and 'O' were transmitted. About an hour later, having recovered from the crash, the SDS Sigma 7 computer sent a full 'login'. The first permanent ARPANET link was then established on November 21, 1969, between the IMP (interface message processor) at UCLA and the IMP at the Stanford Research Institute. By December of 1969, four nodes were permanently installed at UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, University of Utah, and University of California at Santa Barbara. By 1975 there were 57 IMPs. By 1981 there were 213, and it has continued to explode inpopularity ever since.

This machine is where the internet breathed to life, spoke its first words,' Leonard Kleinrock, the computer scientist for whom the Kleinrock Center for Internet Studies is named, told Gizmodo. However, Kleinrock admits the machines were almost lost. There are currently only two IMPs still in existence. UCLA's IMP was replaced by new technology in 1982 and moved to a staff break room. The tiny mention of the project in the University paper was the only mention of it at the time .

The restored room was first opened in 2011, after being converted to a computer lab for current students, and was restored by the original team - who even matched the paint for photographs. 'We didn't know what we were doing,' says Kleinrock. 'We didn't even take a photo.' The only mention of the world-changing experiment was a small item in the school paper.

A family feud in Conyers, Georgia ended in bloody murder of the mother of two identical twin girls--one of whom faces 30 years in prison, and the other who may be sentenced for life. Tasmiyah Whitehead, 20, pleaded guilty on Thursday to voluntary manslaughter of her mother Jarmecca 'Nikki' Whitehead, 34. The murder occurred almost four years ago on January 13. Tasmiyah also pleaded guilty to possession of a knife during the crime and falsification in government matters, reports the Atlanta Journal Constitution. She will face 30 years in prison. Tasmiyah(left) and her sister Jasmiyah(right) will serve time in prison for murdering their mother . Tasmiyah's twin Jasmiyah, 20, will go to trial in March for her role in the murder and she could face a life's sentence. Unlike her sister, she refused a plea deal. It's unclear as to whether Tasmiyah will testify against her sister. The girls, who were 16 at the time of the 2010 killing, severed their mother's spinal cord. Jarmecca also suffered from stab wounds to her lungs, jugular, and the back of her neck, said prosecutors. Tasmiyah recently told prosecutors she and her sister woke up late for school and saw their mother in the kitchen, Rockdale District Attorney Richard R. Read said on Thursday. He describes how the girls' mother hit Jasmiyah with a pot. 'Tas took the pot from their mother and Nikki grabbed a steak knife,' said Read. 'There was name-calling and cursing and gouging and scratching and everybody was mad,' Read said. 'During the fight, her mom was cut and stabbed,' he continued. Jarmecca tried to seek refuge at a neighbor's house but no one was home, said read. She sat back down at the kitchen table and that's when the last of the attack leading top her death occurred. Jarmecca 'Nikki' Whitehead was beaten and stabbed repeatedly by her identical twin daughters . The girls were once A students and girl scouts but then became interested in marijuana and boys . 'Tas said Nikki came and sat down in the kitchen … she was tired,' Read said. 'Tas said Nikki lunged at the knife. Eventually the blows necessary to bring about the death of Nikki Whitehead were given.' After the murder, the girls went to school. It wasn't until later that day that the girls summoned a Rockdale County Sheriff's deputy who was driving by their home. They lied and said they found their mother dead. Police found cut and bite marks on the twins implicating their involvement in the scuffle. Both girls originally pleaded not guilty and were arrested and charged after four months of police investigation. The family had a violent history prior to the fight the scaled to murder. The girl once had straight As and were girl-scouts, but their grades started to slip and they were interested in boys. Their mother accused them of smoking pot and being sexually active. The girls also accused their mother of using illegal drugs. The girls claimed that their mother was a hypocrite because she also smoked pot and was promiscuous . 'Nikki believed they were sexually active, using marijuana and skipping school,' he said. 'They believed she was a hypocrite because she was promiscuous and used marijuana.' The twins got in a fight with their mother earlier in 2008 and were forced by a juvenile court to live with their great-grandmother Della Frasier. They moved back with their mother a week before the murder. Read says the twins told a counselor that if forced to go back to their mother's home they would kill her. 'Jasmiyah said, ‘If I have to move back with her, I’ll kill her,’' he said in court Thursday.The girls have been in jail since their arrest in 2010. When Tasmiyah was 17, she was moved to Rockdale County jail and she will stay there until she is moved to a Department of Corrections facility to do the rest of her time. Jasmiyah, who will have trial in March, is being held without bond in Newton County jail in Covington. 'All members – mom, great-grandmother and the girls – struggle to take their own responsibility for family stress. The adults in this family have failed to guide these children properly,' said Read who read notes from a juvenile court counselor. Jarmecca's mother and Frazier's daughter , Lydia Whitehead, told the court she was heartbroken. She said she loves and forgives the twins but wish that they hadn't committed such a terrible crime. 'Unfortunately, my grandchildren never learned right from wrong … and that’s why we are here,' she said. 'They should be in college, not sitting somewhere in jail.' Friends of the girls created a facebook page to support them.

Joe Preston died from a suspected ecstasy overdose after he collapsed following a night out with friend . A former grammar school pupil died from a suspected ecstasy overdose after he collapsed following a night out with friends. Joe Preston, 17, had been celebrating his friend's 18th birthday at a dance music event in Leeds, West Yorkshire before he collapsed at the home of a fellow reveller. His friends called 999 and attempted CPR on the carpentry student, and although he was rushed to hospital he died shortly after his arrival at Bradford Royal infirmary - just before his worried family arrived to see him. Police believe Joe, from Ilkley, Yorkshire, became ill after consuming alcohol and ecstasy during his night out on Saturday. Joe's family were told of his collapse by the hospital at 8.30am on Sunday, but by the time they arrived 30 minutes later he had died. Today, Joe's parents and brothers described him as a quiet, shy boy who was passionate about pursuing a career as a joiner, but tragically paid the ultimate price for taking drugs. Speaking at the family home, grieving father Ed said lessons should be learned from his youngest son's death. 'It’s not about just getting the message across to kids but also about getting the message across to parents,' said the design engineer . 'As parents we are all concerned. The message is that parents need to set up some early warning network for anything new they hear about. 'It’s all well setting up these education programmes for kids like ""just say no"", but saying no to a 16 or 17-year-old is like a red rag to a bull. 'They need to be informed what these drugs are, what the different strengths are and what is coming in. 'Joe had his whole life ahead of him and was lucky in that he would have had the support to fulfil his ambitions, but all that’s gone now. 'Joe’s gone now, we can’t bring him back. I just hope it’s a lesson for his friends.' The 54-year-old called for more detailed drugs information to be freely available for both children and parents. 'Lots of kids do it and he was just unlucky. He made a mistake and he’s paid for it,' said Mr Preston. 'We talked to Joe, but there’s only so much you can say and that they’ll listen to. Tragedy: Although Joe was rushed to hospital he died shortly after his arrival at Bradford Royal infirmary - just before his worried family arrived to see him . 'They’ll more likely listen to their friends, but nobody made Joe take it - it was his choice and he’s paid the price.' Joe's mother Viv, 50, said: 'Don’t think it can’t happen to you. 'We want to hide away from it but we can’t because we have to go on somehow. 'It’s more important to try and get the message you want out, you can’t bury your head in the sand.' Joe, a former pupil at Ilkley Grammar School, was in his second year of a college course in carpentry and joinery. It was a course he loved and one he hoped would lead to a career. 'He was doing really well. It was all coming together,' said Mrs Preston. 'He seemed happy. 'It only takes one dodgy pill, one chemical in it, they could take it hundreds of times and then it would be that one time it’s bad' James Preston, Joe's brother . 'His friends were everything to him. He was a really loyal, caring friend - he’d put his friends first all the time. 'He was a quiet lad with a wicked sense of humour, like his dad.' Mrs Preston, an administration worker at Airedale Hospital, said she hoped other teenagers would think about what her family was going through following Joe's death. Joe lived on a leafy street in the Ben Rhydding area of Ilkley with his parents and his brother Ollie, 19. His other brother James, 21, lives in Manchester. James said: 'People could do it all the time but it only takes one dodgy pill, one chemical in it, they could take it hundreds of times and then it would be that one time it’s bad.' Ollie added: 'People should be given realistic advice. People just don’t know, they see a pill that has a picture on it or is a certain colour and they think they know what they are getting.' 'This is a small community and the people he knows will likely take more notice. If it means they think or stop and not take drugs, that will be a positive thing. 'If people can just stop and try to imagine what we’re going through now - a kid won’t want their parents to go through what we’re going through. The message is simple, just think.' Police said a post-mortem examination proved to be inconclusive and further tests will now be carried out to establish the cause of Joe's death. Two 18-year-old men, who were arrested on suspicion of supplying controlled drugs, have been released on bail. An inquest into Joe’s death is expected to open later this week.","Joe Preston had been celebrating a friend's birthday before he collapsed .

Henri Canning, 25, harvested hundreds of cannabis plants in his flat to fund his big day . A groom who amassed a £15,000 drug empire to pay for his wedding has been jailed after electricity engineers spotted a 'hot wire' to his factory. Henri Canning, 25, harvested hundreds of cannabis plants in his flat to fund his big day. But the railway worker was foiled by EDF power engineers who spotted the wire leading to his makeshift factory in Folkestone, Kent. He was then arrested and charged with producing the class B drug. The father-of-one was jailed for 32 months at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting the production of cannabis and illegally taking electricity. Jailing him, Judge Heather Norton said: 'These are serious offences and you are a man of previous good character and someone who so many people speak so highly of you. 'Why you should find yourself doing these things to pay off debts, one of the reasons I am told, is because of your wedding debts. 'If that is right, then it is tragic that you should have got yourself into so much debts that the only way you thought you could pay them off was in the way you tried was running a cannabis factory.' Jim Harvey, prosecuting, said Canning had racked up thousands of pounds worth of debt after his marriage starting his new life his wife. He continued to rent his empty flat for three months and spent £3,000 setting up the factory to cultivated mass quantities of cannabis. Mr Harvey told the court the newly wed father made as much as £15,000 from the sale of the drug. The plot was only foiled when staff from EDF, who were working nearby, went to check a nearby electricity metre and found it had been tampered with. The father-of-one was jailed for 32 months at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting the production of cannabis and illegally taking electricity . When detectives at Kent Police raided the property they found 113 of the plants - that would have landed the crook more than £20,000. Mr Harvey added: 'Fortunately an electrical company had been carrying out work in the area and engineers became concerned about the prodigious amounts of electricity coming from the house. 'Police officers attended the property and discovered a small cannabis factory and later officials at the power company estimated that Canning had taken more than £2,100 worth of electricity illegally.' Niall Doherty, defending, said Canning 'deeply regrets' what he has done and has agreed to repay the electricity firm. He said Canning faced mounting debts as a result of his wedding and 'stupidly and naively' thought growing cannabis was a way to pay 'everything off'. As well as his custodial sentence Canning was ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £120.","Henri Canning, 25, harvested cannabis plants in flat to fund big day .

I explained to them what had happened and that I’d turned my anger to the lady on the phone,' Mr Johnston said. 'I said ""I don’t need to got hospital. I’m absolutely perfect but I’m so angry about Swale council’s position"",' he went on. 'I’m not making any money. Last Thursday I had one customer and took just £9.60. If I lose the pub I’ll also lose the shop because the finances are linked to the two businesses... I plan to appeal against the decision,' Mr Johnston added. Anger: Hari Johnston had been certain he would be allowed to convert The Railway Tavern in Teynham into a large house. He was left furious when Swale Borough Council rejected the application . Mr Johnston bought The Railway Tavern in a bid to save it from closure in August 2009, but the pub is now open for just 21 hours a week after support from villagers dwindled. Mr Johnston wants to transform the premises into a home for his family because he claims it is 'no longer commercially viable'. A council spokesman said: 'Our planning department was contacted last week by an applicant who was disappointed with the outcome of a planning application. 'During conversation, the gentleman became agitated and upset, and made comments which raised serious concern for his welfare. The member of staff took advice and contacted Kent Police.' 'Safeguarding of children and adults is a priority for everyone at Swale council, and we make no apologies for ensuring the safe welfare of our community.' The spokesman also claimed Mr Johnston’s development was turned down because it contributed to 'community facilities in the village'. He added: 'The proposal fails to demonstrate, by suitable means of market testing, that there is insufficient demand to justify the retention for business and community use.'

TV presenter Chris Tarrant suffered a mini stroke during an 11-hour flight, it was revealed yesterday. The 67-year-old Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? host needed emergency treatment to remove a potentially fatal blood clot. He was initially thought to have suffered a bad asthma attack on the flight from Bangkok. But on landing at Heathrow he was taken to hospital where doctors discovered a clot in his leg. It is thought part of the clot broke away and lodged in a blood vessel in his head, causing a temporary loss of blood to the brain. 'Remarkable recovery': Chris Tarrant's agent said that the star is making good progress after suffering a mini-stroke on the way back from Thailand . Experts say sitting on a plane for so . long may have helped Tarrant’s clot to form. The symptoms of a mini . stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, are similar to those of a stroke – . numbness in the face and limbs, and slurred speech – but they last for . less than 24 hours. In most . cases they ease within minutes but a mini stroke is often a warning . that a person is at risk of suffering a potentially fatal stroke. Tarrant . at first believed he was having an asthma attack brought on by the poor . air quality in Burma, where he had been filming the second series of . his Extreme Railways documentaries before flying home from Thailand. Yesterday, . Tarrant’s manager Paul Vaughan confirmed the presenter has been . receiving treatment at London’s Charing Cross Hospital since March 1. The father of four is expected to leave hospital today or tomorrow. ‘He has had the best possible care,’ Mr Vaughan said. ‘It was quite a shock, but now he just wants to get back home. ‘He’s . in good spirits. He is hugely grateful for the care he has received and . all the kind wishes he has been receiving on a daily basis.’ Mr Vaughan added: ‘He's speaking very well, he's moving, he's walking and wanting to go out and about. He doesn’t like lying in hospital. It’s all very positive. The doctors have been wanting to make certain everything was all right.’ Globetrotter: Chris Tarrant was in the middle of filming a Channel 5 travel show when he was taken ill (pictured is the star on location for Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railways) The TV presenter was taken from the tarmac at Heathrow to Charing Cross Hospital in west London, where he was seen by emergency doctors . The . hospital and consultant treating Tarrant is the same that looked after . TV presenter Andrew Marr when he suffered a stroke last year. Marr has described how he was struck by 'a blinding headache and flashes of light'. He woke up the next morning lying on his bedroom floor, unable to move. He was paralysed down his left side but the area of the brain that controls speech and memory was unaffected. Stroke is a 'brain attack', according to the Stroke Association. Its website says: 'For your brain to function, it needs a constant blood supply, which provides vital nutrients and oxygen to the brain cells. A stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off and brain cells are damaged or die. 'About a third of people who have a stroke make a significant recovery within a month. But most stroke survivors will have long-term problems. It may take a year or longer for them to make the best possible recovery. Sadly, in the most severe cases, strokes can be fatal or cause long-term disability.' It says that members of the public can recognise a stroke using the FAST test: . 1) Facial weakness - can the person smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped?2) Arm weakness - Can the person raise both arms?3) Speech problems - Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say?4) Time to call 999. The Stroke Association says that failing any of these tests means it's a medical emergency and it's time to call 999.","TV star Tarrant was flying back from Thailand when he was taken ill .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:16 EST, 12 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:03 EST, 12 March 2014 . Shadow childcare minister Lucy Powell said part-time staff are treated as lower status employees, despite often working harder . Working mothers on part-time hours can be better employees because they do not waste time in the office browsing Facebook or nursing a hangover, a Labour frontbencher has claimed. Shadow childcare minister Lucy Powell called for a change in office culture which means part-timers are viewed as lower 'status' employees. Far from being less productive, those working three or four days a week are often squeezing the work of a full-time employee into fewer hours, she added. It comes as a new survey shows fewer than one in seven employees in top jobs work part-time. Unions claim most of the country's best-paid jobs are 'no-go' areas for people not willing to work full-time hours. Official figures show that women working part-time or taking time off to have children means their pay stops rising a decade earlier than men. A recent government survey found small firms in particular did not recognise the wider benefits of flexible working to the business. But Miss Powell, who gave birth to son Tom in May last year, said she wanted 'champion working mums’. She told MailOnline: ‘Part-timers and people who are on flexible working contracts often aren’t given the same status in the workplace. ‘We need to put these issues centre stage because they are incredibly important. 'They are issues of fundamental inequality. We need to show companies and champion more women who successfully are able to manage a career whilst either working part-time or doing that while having children. ‘So we can debunk the myths that we are less productive and less successful because we might work three or four days a week as opposed to working full-time. ‘Some savvy businesses very often find that people working flexibly are more productive because they tend to use their time more effectively.’ Working mothers are used to juggling multiple demands at home and bring those skills to the office, she added. ‘We are not sitting on Facebook or coming in with a hangover. When we are working we are on it – and making the most of every minute of every day because when you are at home with family you have got to be on it every minute as well.’ Working mothers are better at juggling the demands of life in the office, because they also have to be 'on it' at home, Miss Powell said . She said employers had to recognise that supporting working mothers was ’good for business’. ‘It is about retaining a talented and loyal workforce,’ she said. Research by the TUC showed that two-thirds of the 900,000 employees in the highest paid occupations, such as financial managers and medical practitioners, are male. Just 6 per cent of chief executives and senior company officials - who earn more than £43-an-hour - work part-time and only one in four is female. However the lowest-paid jobs, like cleaners and working in shops, are dominated by women and part-time work. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Young women are more than able to match their male colleagues as they start out in their careers. 'But too much of their talent and experience goes to waste as soon as they have children and seek greater flexibility in their working hours. 'Employers' blinkered refusal to allow senior staff to work part-time and flexibly means that many top-paying occupations are complete ""no-go"" areas for staff wanting to work shorter hours. Instead, millions of women are forced into low-paying sectors.' Women earn most before they turn 40, according to the Office for National Statistics. Their pay peaks in the 30-39 age group at £533-a-week or £27,726-a-year. However, men continue to see another 10 years of wage rises, peaking in the 40-49 age group at £638-a-week or £33,176. Men see their average weekly earnings rise until they turn 50 but women's pay peaks before they turn 40, according to the ONS . The ONS said: ‘This is likely to be . connected with the fact that many women have children and the time taken . out of the labour market, combined with career choices they make . subsequent to this, may impact on their earnings thereafter.’ Labour has promised to extend free childcare for three and four year olds with working parents from 15 to 25 hours. It would also guarantee childcare before and after school for primary school age children. Meanwhile the coalition is offering free childcare for two-year-olds from the poorest households, and will give a tax break worth £1,200 off the cost of childcare.","Shadow childcare minister Lucy Powell says part-timers have lower 'status'

The restaurant manager and barman of an upmarket riverside restaurant stood before a judge today accused of killing a customer. The two men, along with the boyfriend of another colleague, allegedly restrained the man so forcefully that he stopped breathing and suffered a fatal heart attack. Gary Eastley, Jake Corney and Dawid Lamkowski deny the charge of manslaughter. A jury heard that Eastley and Lamkowski . held Marcin Pastuszczak down on the ground outside Boulters Restaurant and Bar in Maidenhead for more than half an hour, before . being joined by Corney. Gary Eastley (right), Jake Corney (right) and Dawid Lamkowski allegedly restrained a 34-year-old man so forcefully that he stopped breathing and suffered a fatal heart attack . When police arrived at the scene in Maidenhead, Berkshire, they turned the unresponsive 34-year-old over and noticed he was not breathing and his lips were blue. They called for an ambulance and tried in vain to revive him. The three defendants and barmaid Tasha Wicks - Corney’s girlfriend - were all arrested even though Mr Pastuszczak was not formally pronounced dead until the following morning. Police later charged the men with manslaughter on the grounds of using unreasonable force against their victim. Prosecutor John Price QC told the nine women and three men on the jury: ‘Prolonged restraint of a person, involving the application of pressure to their trunk or torso, may inhibit the in-and-out movements of the chest which are essential for proper respiration. ‘In other words, an individual may be prevented by such pressure from fully breathing in and out. ‘Mr Pastuszczak had been restrained with such force and for so long a time that ultimately he suffered a cardiac arrest, itself being brought on because during the time he was under the restraint he could not breathe properly.’ He told the jury at Guildford Crown Court: ‘They are charged with the offence of manslaughter because the use of the force by which the fatal restraint was applied by them, was unlawful.’ Mr Price said that following his arrest, bar manager Gary Eastley had told police the victim had grabbed him and had been trying to do the same to barmaid Tasha Wicks and get her telephone number. He said that fearing for his safety and that of colleagues and customers, he had restrained the man, before restaurant manager Lamkowski helped to take him outside. Meanwhile, Miss Wicks made the first of several emergency calls to Thames Valley Police. A jury heard that Eastley and Lamkowski held Marcin Pastuszczak down on the ground outside Boulters Restaurant and Bar (pictured) in Maidenhead for more than half an hour, before being joined by Corney . When police arrived at the scene in Maidenhead, Berkshire, they turned the unresponsive drinker over and noticed he was not breathing and his lips were blue . ‘He continued to struggle violently. He had so much strength. He was lashing out at us,’ Eastley said in a prepared statement to the police. ‘We were simply trying to restrain him, desperate for the police to arrive.’ However, jurors watched CCTV footage from cameras at the restaurant which showed that after the initial restraint inside the bar, Mr Pastuszczak was lying on the floor motionless and was even dragged from the room without appearing to offer any resistance. Accounts by other customers, David Chapman and Laura Tuffrey, on Mr Pastuszczak’s behaviour before and after the initial confrontation contrasted with Eastley’s statement, said the prosecution. Mr Price said earlier CCTV footage also cast doubt on Eastley’s account of the victim’s alleged aggression and behaviour towards him and Miss Wicks. He said: ‘It is submitted by the prosecution that by comparison with other available evidence as to what took place on the first floor, what was said can be demonstrated to be untrue. ‘Things did not happen as he described to the police.’ Once outside the bar the employees got Mr Pastuszczak onto the ground again. Corney then arrived, having heard of the situation in a phone call with his girlfriend. He joined in the restraint, allowing Eastley to return inside and make more calls to the police. The prosecution said it was during this time that Corney could be seen striking a number of blows at the victim. This photograph shows forensic officers on Boulters Lock at the time of Mr Pastuszczak's death . ‘The prosecution submit that Mr Corney had an agenda of his own. It was to punish him. This was not and could never have been lawful,’ said Mr Price. He accepted that by the fateful night of November 8, 2012, 34-year-old Polish-born Mr Pastuszczak had established a reputation as a heavy drinker and troublemaker, which had seen him barred from a number of pubs in the Berkshire town. He had even had a confrontation with Eastley at the bar five months before his death and it was this which the prosecution believes played a large part in what happened. He urged the jury to base their findings predominantly on what happened on the night in question and not previous events. To do otherwise would be, he said, using a footballing analogy, ‘to play the man rather than the ball’, which is what he said Eastley had done. ‘He responded not to the behaviour in front of him but to the reputation,’ he said. Eastley, 26, from Moor Lane, Maidenhead, Lamkowski, 29, from Snowdon Avenue, Maidstone, Kent, and Jake Corney, 23, of Filmer Road, Windsor, Berkshire, all deny the single charge. The trial, before Judge Christopher Critchlow is expected to last about two weeks.

'Nightmare': Newcastle United striker Loic Remy has hit out of 'vicious and greedy' women who target footballers . Twenty-seven-year-old . Remy was one of three men last year accused of the champagne-fuelled . gang rape of a 34-year-old woman at his rented flat in Fulham, West . London. He denied the allegation, and last month the Metropolitan Police finally said there would be no further action taken against him. He admitted he should have been smarter, but said: 'When you're a footballer, single and want to have fun, you can have any girl you want. 'Before it was not like that. I see things that make me afraid. I see these girls - what they can do.' Remy's accuser claimed that he, his cousin and his friend raped her last May 6, Bank Holiday Monday, at his £2million rented flat at Marina Point, Imperial Wharf. It was claimed the woman visited the fourth-floor flat where she was said to have been offered champagne before being raped. After the alleged assault, it is understood the woman travelled to Kent where she reported the attack to police the following day. They in turn passed on the details to the Met. Speaking of the moment police stormed . his home, Remy said: 'When you are woken up at 5am by seven or . eight police, you think it's a dream or a nightmare.'

Cristian Montano, an Oldham Athletic midfielder, allegedly took the woman to a flat in Romford, Essex and attacked her while she was passed out. She told jurors that she woke up and pleaded with the men to stop, but they continued raping her. Montano, 22, is on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court along with his friends Andres Hurtado, 23, and Camilo Valencia, 22. All three men deny rape. 'Attack': Footballer Cristian Montano, right,  and his friend Andres Hurtado, left, are alleged to have raped a woman following a night out in July 2012 . The woman said she woke up to find that she was naked and the Colombian footballer was having sex with her. The court heard that when he had finished Hurtado pulled his trousers down and had sex with the 22-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons. She claimed she repeatedly told the men to get off her, but she could not move as Valencia climbed on top of her and continued the attack. The woman met the men during a night out with a friend in Romford in July 2012, jurors were told. Gang: Camilo Valencia is also alleged to have taken part in the attack on a 22-year-old woman . Giving evidence via video link, she told the court she remembered leaving the nightclub before losing her friend and blacking out. 'My next memory was waking up in the bedroom, naked, with no clothes on,' she said. 'I don't remember how I got there or taking my clothes off - I didn't know where I was and I hadn't been there before. 'One of them was having sex with me and he said something in another language and then a couple of them came back into the room. 'I was trying to push him off me but I couldn't, he was too strong but I was saying ""Get off me."" The others were just stood there watching. 'Immediately after that another guy got into the bed and he penetrated me as well. I kept saying ""No"" but he didn't say anything and he just kept going. 'I tried to get up and move off the bed but I couldn't, then another guy, he was already undressed, and it was all over quickly. 'I went into the bathroom and sat there for a bit - I felt dirty.' The men called her a taxi, which took her to a friend's house, the court heard. She said that she was given her clothes and mobile phone back, but a clutch bag she had when she left the club was never returned. The woman told the court: 'They were saying to me like, ""Don't worry it's not your fault,"" trying to act like I wanted it to happen and I consented.' Montano was playing for West Ham United at the time of the alleged attack, but later moved to League One club Oldham.

A burglar carried out a string of 30 burglaries because he could not face his 'boring' life and needed to steal cars to get a 'kick' out of joyriding, a court has heard. Layabout teenager Ryan Legge, 19, looted victims’ homes for pleasure after he decided he wanted to 'alleviate' his humdrum life. In a two-year crime spree he targeted properties with unlocked doors or open windows, usually when the occupants were asleep in bed or watching TV. Ryan Legge, 19 (left) targeted houses even when the owners were at home along with his accomplice Alex Riley, 22 (right). Both men were jailed today for four years at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester . In many cases he also stole the household car using keys left on open view. Jobless Legge was arrested after his fingerprints were found on property stolen from a home in Royton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester. He later claimed he was motivated into burglary by the 'need to alleviate boredom' rather than to fund a luxury lifestyle. He claimed his criminal behaviour was 'grafting'.

Today, victims of Legge reacted with anger to his excuses after he was locked away for four years at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester. He had earlier pleaded guilty to two charges of burglary and a further count of taking a vehicle without consent, and asked for 34 other offences to be taken into consideration - 28 of them burglaries. Post office worker Trish Clune, 46, who had her Vauxhall Astra stolen in a raid on her home in Chadderton, Oldham, said after the hearing: 'I think his excuse is disgusting. I have never been burgled before and it was absolutely terrible. Ryan Legge, who stole a £1,300 pug dog during his crime spree showing-off his watch on his Facebook profile . 'These people want their fingers chopped off. If they are that bored then go and find a job like most folk - not rob people’s houses. My son is 20 and he has a job. It was devastating - it took me a long time to get over it.' She added: 'This boy and his mate took the Vauxhall Astra and also the keys for the other two cars and then they tried to return for those. 'It’s incredible to think they had the cheek to come back round the corner afterwards. It’s just lucky someone saw them and they ran off. 'Being burgled is a horrible experience and the worst bit is not necessarily having something taken. It’s the fact we had an intruder invading our house. To say he was bored is no excuse whatsoever.' Earlier the court heard how during the burglary spree householders were wakened in the early hours to find they had been burgled. At one at a house a Citroen C4 was stolen and the homeowners knew nothing of the break-in until the next morning. In one raid on the home of a couple, their son-in-law who lived opposite spotted two men in the garden, one filling a bag with bottles of champagne and spirits. A pug dog valued at more than £1,300 was also stolen but later recovered. In mitigation for Legge his counsel Ben Knight said his client got a 'kick' of joyriding in stolen vehicles which were always recovered undamaged. Jobless: Ryan Legge flaunting a bottle of champagne (left) while (right) he poses with an unnamed female friend . Mr Knight added: 'He was motivated by a need to alleviate boredom rather than to fund an extravagant lifestyle. The houses were not ransacked and the methods of breaking in were opportunistic and unsophisticated.' Legge’s accomplice Alex Riley, 22, was found guilty by a jury of two charges of burglary and two offences of taking vehicles without consent. He was also jailed for four years. Both men were each ordered to pay £120 victim surcharges. Judge Jeffrey Lewis told them: 'You’re not afraid of entering houses at night when they are occupied yet you have not got the faintest idea of the devastation that can be caused by your actions. 'You both have formidable records and are seriously at risk of spending a great deal of your adult lives in custody.' Legge’s family have since moved out of their home in the Fitton Hill area of Oldham. A neighbour said: 'They weren’t here that long but it sounds like we are well rid.’","Ryan Legge stole a £1,300 pet pug during his two-year crime spree .

Her husband Malcolm jumped in to try to save her, but the current was too strong . A retired doctor has told how he desperately fought to save his wife when she fell into a waterfall but did not have the strength to pull her free from the strong current. Malcolm and Sue Jones had been out walking with their dog near their Lake District home when she slipped and fell into the fast-flowing water, getting trapped face-down among some large boulders. An inquest into her death was told that Dr Jones leapt into the waterfall but the current was so strong and the water so deep that he could not reach the mother-of-two. Mrs Jones, 60, suffered fatal head injuries when she toppled into the water at Force Forge, Satterthwaite, Cumbria on January 11 this year, the inquest at Barrow Town Hall heard. 'We wanted to take the dog down a steep . slope to a big pool so he could go in the water,' said 61-year-old Dr . Jones. 'After he went in the water for a little bit we went back up. 'The dog was dawdling so Sue went ahead and I was about 20 yards behind. 'Then I heard a short scream and she was gone.' Dr Jones, who said the couple had walked along the stream together 'many times', told the hearing that his wife became lodged face-down in the water against large boulders. 'The current was so strong and the water was so deep I just could not get to her,' he said. The court heard Dr Jones lost his glasses and sustained a scratch to his forehead in his attempts to reach his wife. The water eventually dislodged Mrs Jones’ body and she was washed down to the pool. 'I swam and grabbed her and pulled her to the edge. By then I was so cold I didn’t have the strength to pull her onto the bank,' he said. The court heard Dr Jones had already realised that Mrs Jones was unlikely to be alive as she had been face down for so long. 'I turned her over and she wasn’t breathing and didn’t have a pulse,' he said. Dr Jones lodged Mrs Jones’s body against the bank of the pool and went to get help. Rescue mission: Malcolm Jones (right) leapt into the waterfall but the current was so strong and the water so deep that he could not reach his wife (left), who was trapped face-down between some large boulders . Assistant coroner for south and east Cumbria, Mr Alan Sharp, read a statement from Lee Warren, who spotted Dr Jones by a roadside covered in blood from his head injury and soaking wet. The statement said: 'He told me his wife had fallen and I think she’s dead.' Mr Warren rushed down to the stream, pulled Mrs Jones from the water and delivered CPR. Emergency services were called and she was taken to Royal Lancaster Infirmary,but was pronounced dead just hours later. A post-mortem examination found the cause of death to be traumatic brain injury and fractured skull caused by hitting a large, sharp object. Mr Sharp recorded a verdict of accidental death. The couple, originally from Thame, Oxfordshire, had owned a holiday cottage in Satterthwaite for more than 12 years. Trauma: Mrs Jones, 60, suffered fatal head injuries when she toppled into the water at Force Forge, Satterthwaite, Cumbria . Trapped: Dr Jones, who said the couple had walked along the stream together 'many times', told the hearing that his wife became lodged face-down in the water against large boulders . They made a permanent move to the area two years ago and spent their time renovating the old vicarage. Speaking after his wife's death, Dr Jones had said: 'We have always travelled to the Lakes and we knew that we would eventually want to move here.' 'This was the house my wife had always had her eye on and so when it came onto the market we decided to take the opportunity to move here. It is a beautiful place to live, and Sue loved everything about it.' He added: 'Sue loved developing the friendships she had made with the villagers. 'We felt very settled here, the community is very small and everyone welcomed us. Sue had a lot of good friends in our village. 'She . was desperate for grandchildren, and she was just so excited to be . helping in the pub - she had so much fun helping out. It gave us both a . new lease of life really.' The couple were joined later by their daughter Emma, 29, and her partner Simon Cole, who took over the village’s Eagles Head pub in November. Assistance: A passerby Lee Warren spotted Dr Jones by a roadside covered in blood and rushed down to the stream to help . 'We could only run a pub with the support of our family, and so we felt it was Satterthwaite or nothing,' said Ms Jones. 'My mum was so pleased to have us here, everything was working out and she had so many great ideas.' The family said that housewife and enthusiastic cook Mrs Jones had been known for her ‘famous chocolate brownie’ which was a favourite on the pub menu. 'Her priority was her family and her friends,' said Ms Jones. 'She did everything for everybody and could never do enough for us. 'She . spent so much time decorating the house it was just perfect, she was . the most amazing host and loved having us all together as a family.' Mrs Jones's son, paediatric doctor Andrew Jones, 32, who lives in south London with his wife Sonya, 31, said: 'She was very content and happy with what life had to offer right now. Emma and my mum were extremely close, and so when Emma and Simon decided to buy the pub it was the best thing that could have happened. 'She was thrilled to be helping out, everything was really busy and thriving for them.' He added: 'She was a very soft, loving person who was elegant and beautiful inside and out. It is down to mum that we are such a close family, and so it is her legacy that we do her proud and stick together at this horrible time. 'She just wanted everyone to be happy, we have lost such a special person.'","Malcolm and Sue Jones had been walking near their Lake District home .

A family man was kicked to death in front of his partner after intervening to complain about a noisy party, a jury heard. Danny Walsh, 30, stopped to complain about the noise as he walked past the party with his partner Katie Loosemore and their two year-old toddler Layla May in a pushchair. The couple were concerned the noise would be keeping families in the neighbouring houses awake - one of whom had a daughter with a terminal illness, Lincoln Crown Court heard. Danny Walsh, 30, died from serious brain injuries after allegedly being attacked after complaining about the noise at a house party in Grantham, Lincolnshire, on July 28 last year . But the householder Kelly Parsons emerged from the property in Grantham, Lincolnshire, to scream abuse at Mr Walsh. It is alleged after Mr Walsh returned to the property a second time Miss Parson’s brothers Ben and Sam Croft carried out a fatal attack on him. The brothers kicked his head ‘like a football’ as he lay motionless on the ground, the jury was told. Mr Walsh suffered serious brain injuries and despite efforts to save his life he was pronounced dead within hours of the attack happening. Gordon Aspden, prosecuting, told the jury Mr Walsh and his family were walking home in the rain after an evening out at a charity event staged at their local football club Harrowby FC. Mr Aspden said: ‘They intended to leave at 9pm but Layla May had fallen asleep in her buggy so they decided to stay on until the end of the night. Ben Croft, 24, pictured arriving at Lincoln Crown Court, denies murder and denies he was involved in any violence. His brother Sam Croft, 22, also denies murder . ‘Shortly after midnight Danny Walsh and Katie Loosemore set off to walk home. It was raining. Danny was pushing the buggy. ‘Their journey home took them along Edinburgh Road in Grantham. On that Saturday night there was an impromptu party going on. The party was taking place at number 43 which belonged to Kelly Parsons the sister of the two defendants. ‘Both Ben and Sam Croft were at the party. Everyone in the house had been drinking. The noise levels got louder. ‘By this time Danny Walsh and his family had reached the area outside the party. There was the sound of shouting and arguing coming from the house. Some of those present had spilled out onto the street outside. ‘It was at this point Mr Walsh made a fatal mistake - he decided to get involved. ‘He knew there were children sleeping in the area and he shouted across to those in and around the house to keep the noise down. ‘Kelly Parsons appeared. She was drunk and she was screaming at Danny Walsh that it was her house and she would do as she liked. ‘Mr Walsh didn’t back down and repeated his request for them to keep the noise down. ‘A few moments later the two defendants and others were out in the front. There then followed an ugly argument. It involved those at number 43 and Mr Walsh. ‘The argument culminated in a confrontation resulting in Mr Walsh being assaulted by the two defendants. ‘Each of them struck him and each of them by his conduct encouraged the other to do the same. It was a joint assault. ‘He was swiftly knocked to the ground where he was further assaulted. ‘Katie Loosemore tried to intervene but was intercepted by the drunken Kelly Parsons and briefly those two women were fighting in the street. There was shouting and there was noise. ‘Those present began to realise Danny Walsh was in a bad way. He was unconscious, unresponsive and bleeding from the mouth. Attempts were made to rouse him but he didn’t wake up. The reason for that is simple. It was because he was dying.’ Mr Aspden said that Sam Croft, 22, left the scene in a car but his older brother called for an ambulance. Katie Loosemore, the partner of Danny Walsh, told Lincoln Crown Court: 'After he was punched, Daniel was on the floor. He wasn't moving but they carried on kicking. It was like they were kicking a football' Mr Walsh was taken to Grantham Hospital but was in a deep coma and died soon afterwards.Katie Loosemore told the jury that they heard noise from the party as they entered Edinburgh Road and were concerned because there were families with children either side. She said: ‘I knew one of the children had a terminal illness and there were two children the other side. ‘As we walked along I realised that the noise was coming from the house with the red door. ‘The door was open. There were two young men in the street. They were arguing. I couldn’t really make out what they were saying. ‘I knew the people either side of the house had children. I know the people on one side had quite a young baby and the other side had a child who was quite poorly. She had a terminal illness. ‘Daniel said he was going to have words with them and tell them to turn the noise down. We were talking about it. I said I would be fuming. It was because of the kids next door. If you had children next door you wouldn’t really appreciate it.’ She said Danny went across and spoke to Ben Croft, 24, who he knew, but then Croft’s sister Kelly Parsons emerged from the house in her pyjamas. ‘She just started screaming that it was her house and they could do what they want in there and it was nobody else’s business. She seemed quite drunk.’ Miss Loosemore said there was some pushing between Ben Croft and Danny but it calmed down. Lincoln Crown Court heard the incident occurred outside a property in Edinburgh Road, Grantham, Lincolnshire, pictured, on July 28 last year . She walked on with Danny and Layla May but stopped nearby to talk to a friend only for Ben Croft to reappear. ‘Ben shouted to Danny to go over and sort it out. Daniel gave me a kiss on the head and said I love you. He said I’m going over,’ she said. She told the jury that as the incident continued she took Layla May to her friend’s house returning to find Danny in a confrontation with Kelly Parsons before Ben Croft and Daniel started fighting. She said: ‘I saw Daniel get a punch to the side of the head off Ben and a punch at the back of the head. Sam Croft hit Daniel on the back of the head. After he was punched Daniel was on the floor. He wasn’t moving but they carried on kicking. The kicks were to his head. Both of them were kicking him. It was like they were kicking a football.’ Under cross examination Miss Loosemore denied a defence suggestion that Mr Walsh ‘flipped’ when he returned to the house a second time and attacked Sam Croft. She denied a further defence claim that only one kick was aimed at her partner and that ‘she was only seeing what she wanted to see’ when she described Mr Walsh being repeatedly kicked. ‘I have it in my head all the time,’ she insisted, ‘and it is there all the time.’ Ben Croft denied he was involved in any violence while his brother Sam said he acted in self-defence. Ben Croft, 24, and Sam Croft, 22, both of Barrowby, Lincolnshire, each deny murder on 28 July 2013. The trial continues.

Big payout: An Essex secondary school pupil received over £15,000 in compensation after his eyebrow was slightly cut by a DVD case thrown to him by a teacher . A schoolboy was awarded £15,197 in compensation after he sustained a 'tiny cut to the eyebrow' when a teacher threw a DVD case to him. The plastic case accidentally hit the secondary school pupil in the head, with the boy’s family successfully claiming the five-figure pay-out from Essex County Council. The council said the member of staff was attempting to pass the DVD cover to the pupil but 'unintentionally threw it with more force than expected and it accidentally hit him'. It said: 'The damages were agreed in accordance with the guidelines of the Judicial College Guidelines. 'The claimant suffered a scar which was permanent and represented a moderate cosmetic deformity.' The council paid out £7,900 for the family's solicitors' legal costs, £6,750 in damages and £547 in NHS costs. Critics have . now complained of a ‘compensation culture’ in Essex schools. In total £65,586 of taxpayers' money was awarded by Essex council to pupils that successfully sued over injuries between 2011 and 2013, including one who received £16,812 after hurting his hip falling on wet stairs, according to The Sun. Essex teachers are suing schools, too. Thirty-four payouts were handed to injured teachers in the county between 2011 and 2013 – and who received a total of £1.05million. One teacher was awarded £230,000 after he slipped on a sachet of tomato ketchup in a school corridor. He suffered severe injuries in the fall as he was walking out of the staff room at a secondary school in Essex. The personal injury claim was settled outside court by council chiefs who believed they may have been forced to shell out up to £500,000 including legal fees if the case had gone ahead. The teacher in the ketchup incident was hurt on March 18 2008, but did not file a claim until March 10 2011 – just eight days before the three-year legal time limit for making personal injury claims. A Freedom of Information request revealed that the council agreed a final settlement of £230,000 in April last year, including £90,000 in damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity as well as damages for losses such as those relating to earnings and pension. Cautious: Essex County Council said that all compensation claims are investigated and damages paid if the authority is liable (Pictured is the body's headquarters in Chelmsford) The payout also included £120,000 for the teacher’s legal fees and £20,000 in other costs. Other claims to emerge include a £110,000 settlement to a member of staff who suffered a spinal injury after slipping on a wet floor on two separate occasions on the same day. Another employee received £39,450 after suffering a wrist injury when a faulty metal door swung open when they were taking plates to a cupboard. Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, argued that legal battles at school are affecting the quality of teaching. He said: ‘The compensation culture appears to be more common in the school yard than a grazed knee. Wasting taxpayers’ money on unnecessary pay-outs leaves less money available for teaching and higher tax bills for everyone else. ‘Legal costs on top of the actual pay-outs only add to the overall bill and the whole process undermines the ability of teachers to actually teach. It’s time schools resisted unscrupulous claims before teachers are unable to leave the staffroom for fear of the school being sued.’ However, Jerry Glazier, the National Union of Teachers representative for Essex, said there is no compensation culture in schools. He said: ‘We need to see these claims in context. 'As a union we will support members who pursue claims for personal injury when we feel they have been poorly treated by management in schools. ‘Schools are generally very safe environments but employers have a duty of care to protect both teachers and pupils.’ Essex County Council added that it takes ‘health, safety and wellbeing’ seriously and that all compensation claims are investigated and damages paid if the authority is liable.","Essex County Council paid out £15,197 to a pupil whose head was cut .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:24 EST, 10 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:58 EST, 10 March 2014 . Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness stunned a German court today by admitting he had evaded tax through a secret Swiss bank account worth 18.5 million euros (£15.4 million) - six times the amount on a prosecutors' charge sheet. Once one of Germany's most admired managers, Hoeness apologised and appealed for leniency at the start of a trial in a case that shocked Germany and prompted other tax dodgers to turn themselves in. State prosecutor Achim von Engel read the charge sheet in which he was accused of evading 3.5 million euros in taxes - on undeclared income of 33.5 million euros between 2003 and 2009. On trial: Uli Hoeness is accused of eveding 3.5 million euros (£3 million) in taxes by concealing 33 million euros income through an undeclared Swiss bank account . Admission: Hoeness reported himself to authorities . in early 2013, and part of the trial will be to determine whether he did . that because he had become aware there was an investigation against him . or for other reasons, which will affect the sentence he receives . Support: Bayern Munich fans hold up placards of Uli Hoeness outside his trial for tax evasion . Hoeness was once one of Germany's most . respected names in football, winning the 1972 European Championship with . Bayern Munich and the 1974 World Cup with West Germany as a player . before leading Bayern to two Champions League titles as a manager. But the man who went on to turn Bayern Munich into a sports and commercial success before his fall from grace, could be sentenced to between five and 10 years in jail if convicted of evading more than 1 million euros in taxes. 'I'm glad that this is all out in the open now,' 62-year-old Hoeness, who was wearing a dark suit and smiling nervously, told the court. 'I deeply regret my wrongdoing. I'm doing everything I can to put this unhappy chapter behind me.' Hoeness, who as a player won the World Cup with West Germany in 1974 and as manager led Bayern Munich to two European Champions League and many domestic league titles, is hoping the voluntary disclosure will help him avoid jail. Bayern hero: As a player, Hoeness was a Bayern star who won the 1972 European Championship and the 1974 World Cup with West Germany and three straight European Cups (pictured scoring one of his team's four goals against Atletico Madrid in the European Cup final) Club success: As manager, he led Bayern Munich to two Champions Leagues and many domestic league titles . He paid 10 million euros to the tax office in January 2013, and says he voluntarily alerted tax authorities then about his Swiss bank account and undeclared income. What is unclear is whether he informed the tax office about his offence early enough or comprehensively enough to avoid jail. German legal experts say it appears unlikely he fulfilled those requirements. About 100 journalists and spectators packed into the courtroom to witness the start of the four-day trial. Outside the courtroom Bayern Munich fans held up posters expressing their support for Hoeness and pleading for leniency. Hoeness told the court he used his secret account for more than 50,000 speculative trades in financial markets such as foreign exchange and derivatives from 2001 to 2010. He said he lost a million euros between 2003 and 2009. 'It was always clear to me that the account was mainly for gambling,' he said. 'It was a real kick, pure adrenaline. I lost track of it all. Everything was a real mess in the end.' Picturesque: A view of the regional court in Munich where the trial is taking place . Legend: Hoeness played over 200 games for Bayern scoring 86 goals in his career therer . Plenty of information: All the files for the trial of Hoeness in the German court . Hoeness said he was disappointed that the state prosecutors raided his house and arrested him before charging him with tax evasion after his voluntary disclosure in 2013. He said he had received death threats when the public learned of his case.

'I'm not a social parasite,' he said in response to the criticism that by evading taxes he cheated other taxpayers. The case against Hoeness, and other celebrities caught or confessing to tax evasion, led thousands to preemptively pay back taxes in the hope of avoiding prosecution, and helped change the public's perception of tax evasion as a misdemeanour to it being seen as a serious crime. Alice Schwarzer, a leading feminist, Chancellor Angela Merkel's party treasurer Helmut Linssen, Berlin's culture minister Andre Schmitz and former top journalist Theo Sommer have been in the public spotlight for tax evasion issues. The German taxpayers association said that more than 55,000 tax evaders have turned themselves in over the last four years, many in the last year, and paid a total of about 3.5 billion euros in back taxes.","If found guilty Hoeness faces anything from a fine to 10 years in prison .

Prime Minister David Cameron denounced Iran's government as a 'despotic regime' in a speech to Israel's parliament today accusing Tehran of making 'despicable' efforts to arm Palestinian militants. The address to the Knesset was staunchly pro-Israeli, and Cameron delighted his hosts by claiming Jewish ancestral roots and talking tough on Iran, which is in negotiations with world powers on curbing its contested nuclear ambitions. 'I share your deep scepticism and great concern about Iran,' Cameron said.

Simpson and were last known to be in the possession of Khloe's father, Robert Kardashian. Mr Kardashian was Simpson's friend and member of his legal defense team during his murder trial in 1995. Scroll down for video . Key evidence from the day that O.J. Simpson's (right) wife was murdered could have been stolen from Khloe Kardashian's, left, California mansion . Robert Kardashian, left, is seen at OJ Simpson's trial as the verdict is read out in 1995 . Khloe's mansion in Tarzana, California, which she shared with her estranged husband Lamar Odom was burgled earlier this month - she was robbed of at least $250,000 worth of jewellery. But O.J. Simpson's manager Norman Pardo, told RadarOnline he believes people close to Simpson, as well as other individuals, were looking for the set of golf clubs that once belonged to the American football player as key evidence linked to the murder case. RadarOnline reports that Kris Jenner . described the golf clubs in her book in 2011, writing about an encounter . with Mr Kardashian and Simpson days before the murder of Nicole . Brown Simpson.

'When the police came and took him to the airport and he got on the plane, his clubs didn’t make it. They just arrived today.' Jenner claimed that she thought this sounded 'suspicious' in line with many others, who RadarOnline claim believe that that Simpson had hidden the murder weapon, a knife, among the metal clubs so it wouldn’t set off security alarms. Pardo told RadarOnline: 'It’s not the knife or anything like that, but there’s a lot of stuff in the golf clubs that’s not supposed to be in there. 'It wasn’t bloody gloves or bloody clothes. There were other things. The mansion that Lamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian shared was broken in to earlier this month . 'Rumor has it that the golf clubs were hollowed out and there was . something inside them. 'I’ve been told by people very close to O.J. that . what’s in that bag is worth more than most people’s homes. 'Nobody knows . where the golf clubs went after Robert Kardashian died. 'Are they still buried at his house? I recently put the word out that . I’m looking for them and people have been tearing everything apart . looking for them.'

A 62-year-old man charged with bigamy was busted after his second wife used his cellphone to call his first wife. Patrick Smith, from Texas, is accused of marrying Janet Mills Maun while still married to his wife of 34 years, Toni Marie Zimmerman. Zimmerman, who lives in Washington, said she found out about her replacement when Maun called her from her husband's phone in November 2012. It is not clear why she called. 'A woman asked for my husband. I said, 'He's at work in Texas.' And she didn't answer,' Zimmerman said, according to Houston Chronicle. 'She just said, 'Who is this?' And I said, 'This is his wife.' And she said, 'No! This is his wife!'' Zimmerman then reported Smith to authorities. Zimmerman, who also goes by the name Toni Smith, told News 92 FM she separated from her husband in 2006. She said she’s Catholic and does not believe in divorce but needed the separation so she’s not responsible for her husband’s credit card bills. Smith, allegedly believing his legal separation constituted a divorce, moved to Texas and married Maun in 2009. Smith's indictment was handed up by a Fort Bend Grand Jury on February 10. He could serve 10 years behind bars if convicted, although under Texas law, 'reasonably believing one is divorced' can be used as a bigamy defense. In the past: This picture of Patrick Smith and his first wife Toni Marie Zimmerman was taken in the 1980s . Other side of the country: Patrick Smith is accused of being married to two women who live more than 2,000 miles apart from each other . Legal view: Smith's attorney, John Venza Jr, hopes the court throws the case out . Zimmerman claims she reported her husband because she believes bigamy is a crime which should be punished. However Smith's attorney, John Venza Jr, argues Zimmerman was purely motivated by 'greed'. When Smith's second marriage ended last year, Maun was awarded part of her husband's retirement in the settlement. Lawyers . for Zimmerman, however, argue that Maun's marriage to Smith was illegal . and therefore she was not entitled to anything. They said a judge . invalidated the marriage and Maun’s right to any of Smith’s retirement . benefits. 'People need to stand-up for themselves and get this out there because it is a lot like identity theft and fraud. It can be all mixed together,' Zimmerman told News 92 FM. Venza hopes the case will be dismissed at the next court date in April. 'Fort Bend County should have no interest in what's essentially a . family law matter,' he said. 'This is all about a greedy woman in Washington, it's all about money.'

Amid ongoing protests held by fast-food industry workers demanding higher minimum wages, McDonald’s has offered its employees advice on how to properly tip au pairs and personal fitness instructors. The out-of-touch tipping guidelines appeared on the site McResource Line, but were deleted this afternoon following backlash. The post containing suggestions on how to reward your help during the holiday season came from the etiquette website Emily Post. Scroll down for video . McDonald's etiquette: MacDonald's offered its employees tips on how to properly reward the help, including dog walkers, barbers and personal trainers . Tone-deaf tips: If McDonald's employees were to follow the online holiday tipping guide, they would have spent up to a thousand dollars . McDonald’s employees, many of whom earn just over $7.25 an hour, were advised to offer an au pair a gift or one week's pay; a housekeeper was to be rewarded with one day’s pay, while a pool cleaner was due the cost of a single cleaning. Dog walkers, personal fitness instructors, barbers and massage therapists were also not to be left out. McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa McComb justified the tone-deaf tipping guide by telling CNBC in an email that the content was provided by a third-party partner and included quotes from the Emily Post forum. If McDonald's employees were to follow the online holiday guide, they would have spent up to a thousand dollars this season - a tall order considering that an average fast-food worker earns about $9 an hour. Hired help: According to the guide, it is appropriate to gift your dog walker and au pair one week's pay during the holiyda season . According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the typical fast food staffer made $18,130 in 2010. The McResource site affiliated with McDonald’s boasts ‘practical solutions to many of life’s problems and challenges. This is not the first time that McDonald's landed in hot water for offering its employees financial advice. Last month, the employee budget guide published online by the 'McResource' team advised staff to return gifts and eat stale bread if they are struggling to get by on their wages. In July, the fast food giant once again came under fire when its financial planning site called Practical Money Skills for Life provided a sample budget that included no money for heat and set aside only $600 for rent and $20 for health insurance. The questionable etiquette post was deleted this afternoon as fast-food workers and labor organizers marched, waved signs and chanted in 100 cities across America in a concerted push for higher minimum wages. Organizers say walkouts are planned, with rallies set for another 100 cities. But it's not clear what the actual turnout will be, how many of the participants are workers and what impact they'll have on restaurant operations. The actions would mark the largest showing yet in a push that began a year ago. Media circus: The 'helpful' tipping advice was offered to McDonald's workers amid protests held in 100 U.S. cities calling for higher wages . Striking McDonald's worker Abran Escarzaga, 31, protests outside McDonald's in Los Angeles, California, today . Song and dance: Fast-foot workers chanted inside a Wendy's restaurant in Detroit, pushing to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25 . At a time when there's growing national and international attention on economic disparities, labor unions, worker advocacy groups and Democrats are hoping to build public support to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25, or about $15,000 a year for full-time work. Protesters are calling for pay of $15 an hour, but the figure is seen more as a rallying point than a near-term possibility. In New York City, about 100 protesters blew whistles and beat drums while marching into a McDonald's at around 6:30 a.m.; one startled customer grabbed his food and fled as they flooded the restaurant, while another didn't look up from eating and reading amid their chants of 'We can't survive on $7.25!' Community leaders took turns giving speeches for about 15 minutes until the police arrived and ordered protesters out of the store. Some 200 protesters calling for higher wages for fast-food workers stand outside a McDonald's restaurant in Oakland, California, which was shut down for more than half an hour . Protesters rally for better wages at a Wendy's in Detroit today . The crowd continued to demonstrate outside for about 45 minutes. A McDonald's manager declined to be interviewed and asked that the handful of customers in the store not be bothered. In Detroit, about 50 demonstrators turned out for a pre-dawn rally in front of a McDonald's. A handful of employees walked off the job, but the restaurant stayed open as a manager and other employees worked the front counter and drive-thru window. Julius Waters, a 29-year-old McDonald's maintenance worker who was among the protesters, said it's hard making ends meet on his wage of $7.40 an hour. 'I need a better wage for myself, because, right now, I'm relying on aid, and $7.40 is not able to help me maintain taking care of my son. I'm a single parent,' Waters said. In Atlanta, about 40 demonstrators rallied at a Burger King; another demonstration was planned later in the day. Activists hold posters of President Barack Obama during a protest outside a McDonald's restaurant at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. today . Fast food workers attend a protest against McDonald's outside one of its restaurants in New York . The push for higher pay in the fast-food industry faces an uphill battle. The industry competes aggressively on value offerings and companies have warned that they would need to raise prices if wages were hiked. Most fast-food locations are also owned and operated by franchisees, which lets companies such as McDonald's Corp., Burger King Worldwide Inc. and Yum Brands Inc. say that they don't control worker pay. However, labor advocates have pointed out that companies control many other aspects of restaurant operations through their franchise agreements, including menus, suppliers and equipment. Fast-food workers have historically been seen as difficult to unionize, given the industry's high turnover rates. But the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 2 million workers in health care, janitorial and other industries, has been providing considerable organizational and financial support to the push for higher pay over the past year. Protestors chant outside a Burger King restaurant during a protest for a raise in the minimum wage in Charlotte, N.C . Organizers were calling for a one-day labor walkout at fast-food restaurants in 100 cities (demonstrations seen today in Chicago) Berlin Rosen, a political consulting and public relations firm based in New York City, also has been coordinating communications efforts and connecting organizers with media outlets. The National Restaurant Association, an industry lobbying group, said most those protesting were union workers and that 'relatively few' workers have participated in past actions. It called the demonstrations a 'campaign engineered by national labor groups.' McDonald's said in a statement that it's 'committed to providing our employees with opportunities to succeed.' The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said it offers employees advancement opportunities, competitive pay and benefits. In the meantime, the protests are getting some high-powered support from the White House. In an economic policy speech Wednesday, President Barack Obama specifically mentioned fast-food and retail workers 'who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty' in his call for raising the federal minimum wage. All smiles: Grinning McDonald's workers joined protestors at an eatery in Oakland . Labor Secretary Thomas Perez also offered words of support for the protesters on the agency's blog. 'We see momentum gathering and a consensus emerging around the idea that we need to increase the federal minimum wage, to give these workers and millions like them a fair day's pay for a fair day's work,' Perez said in the statement. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has promised a vote on the wage hike by the end of the year. But the measure is not expected to gain traction in the House, where Republican leaders oppose it. Supporters of wage hikes have been more successful at the state and local level. California, Connecticut and Rhode Island raised their minimum wages this year. Last month, voters in New Jersey approved an increase in the minimum to $8.25 an hour, up from $7.25 an hour.","Tipping advice appeared on employee resource site, but the post was later taken down .

In a tell-all article for Daily Life, Ms Wright said: ‘I was driving along in the car recently when my daughter Ruby [name changed] asked if she could go to the doctor's and get a penis.' She said her breath caught in her throat and she tried to stay calm as she told her daughter she would ‘have to Google it when I got home’. Gender confusion: Elle Wright is determined to support her daughter, who wants to be a boy, no matter what she decides about her future . The mother, who runs a clothing store in Byron Bay on the north coast of New South Wales in Australia, said Ruby had never been interested in ‘girly’ clothes or toys. She said: ‘Ruby only wanted to play with Tonka trucks and tool belts. By the time she was three, she simply refused to wear anything remotely girlish.’ The eight-year-old now wanted to be called ‘Jack Black’, and wore her hair short with a swept-over, Justin-Bieber-style fringe. 'At eight years of age, Ruby is still so young, and I have no idea what the next few years will bring. But this has been present in Ruby forever, so I'm not going to overlook or ignore it... ‘I have no idea what the future holds for Ruby, but whatever the outcome, I’m firmly in her corner and we’ll tackle it as a team' Ruby, whom strangers often mistook for a boy, also enjoys playing ‘rough-and-tumble games’, walks with a swagger, rides skateboards and surfs like a pro. When strangers call her ‘mate’ or ‘boy’, Ruby never corrects them - and Ms Wright said she barely noticed it anymore. Until recently, Ruby had only ever wanted to play with boys. Lately she had started to play with girls - but Ms Wright said: ‘It’s definitely a different dynamic.’ The issue of Ruby's gender identity came to a head when her class went on a school camp. Boys and girls were made to sleep in different tents and Ruby was heartbroken when she was put in the girls’ tent. Ms Wright said: ‘She tried to cajole the volunteer parents into believing she was a boy, but didn’t succeed.' More...

Two years ago, the headmaster of Ruby's school called Ms Wright into the office and suggested that Ruby might be more than just a tomboy. He advised Ms Wright to start researching gender identity issues and to contact support groups so she could provide Ruby with the information she needed. Ms Wright said she did not know what the future held for Ruby, and while she did not ‘feel the need to label it at this young age’, she also wanted to be aware of the issues and supportive of her child. She added: ‘At eight years of age, Ruby is still so young, and I have no idea what the next few years will bring. But this has been present in Ruby forever, so I'm not going to overlook or ignore it. 'Once, a couple of mothers suggested I must have wanted a son because of the way I encourage Ruby to dress and behave as she does. I was shocked. I ran away and got into my car shaking with anger. I'd never felt more judged. I've also never been more resolute about letting Ruby be herself' ‘I understand that puberty can be a time of great distress for kids who have gender confusion. Depression and suicide are risks at this time. I believe with love and support you can tackle anything, so I'm going to be as prepared as I can be with information to help Ruby with whatever direction she chooses for her life.’ One option available for children who show evidence of gender dysphoria – where they feel discontent with their sex – is to take drugs that delay the onset of puberty, to give them more time to decide whether they want to begin the process of gender reassignment. Ms Wright said she knew it might be a rocky road ahead for her daughter, and she had already faced criticism from other parents. 'Once, a couple of mothers suggested I must have wanted a son because of the way I encourage Ruby to dress and behave as she does. I was shocked. I ran away and got into my car shaking with anger.

A policewoman who stole crash victims’ details and sold them to injury lawyers in a scam worth up to £1million was branded a ‘disgrace to the uniform’ yesterday. Sugra Hanif, 27, was jailed for three and a half years for tarnishing the reputation of the force after downloading personal details from 2,456 road accidents recorded on a police computer. The constable conspired with her married lover Raza Khan, 27, to sell victims’ names and numbers to ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’ for fees of up to £800 a time. She has now been sacked. Crooked: Sugra Hanif shown arriving at court yesterday (left) and portrait (right) was sentenced to . three and half years' jail at Winchester Crown Court. With her married . lover, she ran a £1m scam to sell information about car accidents to . ambulance-chasing lawyers . Corrupt: Married father-of-two Reza Khan arrives at court for his sentencing yesterday where he was jailed for three years for a scam with WPC Sugra Hanif who illegally accessed the Police National Computer to find details of road traffic accidents, which the pair then sold to unscrupulous lawyers . Yesterday, His Honour Judge Andrew Barnett said that the ‘appalling’ actions of the corrupt officer had undermined public confidence in the police force. ‘You are a disgrace to the uniform you once wore,’ he told her. ‘You have let down the police and you have let down your colleagues because the reputation of Thames Valley Police has been tarnished. That is something that those who still serve have to live with.’ He added: ‘You have behaved in an appalling fashion, breaching time and time again the trust placed in you by the public and those who employ you.’ Winchester Crown Court heard that Hanif, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, trawled through the police national computer downloading almost 2,500 files on those involved in accidents. She then telephoned 644 victims using the fake name Sarah Gold and said that she was from SR Auto Repairs – a company set up by Khan – to pressurise them to seek compensation for their injuries. Policewoman Sugra Hanif is seen arriving at court with her solicitor at a previous hearing. Yesterday she was sent to prison for three and half years for stealing and selling accident victim's details from a police computer. Her cohort and married lover Reza Khan was sent down for three years . The lovers, who had an eight-month affair after meeting when Khan was in prison, set up two other businesses in 2011 selling reference numbers for each incident to solicitors, who paid fees of between £600 and £800 for a lead resulting in a claim. Hanif and Khan netted at least £26,400, but the scheme could have raked in more than £1million if all the details had led to claims. They were arrested after an anonymous tip-off. Prosecutor Peter Asteris said Thames Valley Police could face a fine of £500,000 from the Information Commissioner’s Office, as well as claims from almost 5,000 victims. The court heard Hanif joined the force in 2008 and was the only Muslim officer in Oxford. She alleged father-of-two Khan, who has previous convictions including death by dangerous driving and wounding, threatened to tell her devout family about the affair, but the jury rejected her account. Khan was jailed for three years.","Sugra Hanif, 27, stole details on road crash victims from police computer .

Associated . Press photographer Muhammed Muheisen took the photos in his home country to show the . difficult conditions faced by the women who work as 'bonded labourers'. Scroll down for video .

No escape: Amna Bhatti, 60, a Pakistani brick factory worker, at the site of her work in Mandra, near Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Amna is in debt to her employer for the amount of 150,000 rupees, about £900. She says: 'Once you enter this road, the only way out is death' But, tragically, these workers are just a handful of the hundreds of thousands of women across Pakistan who face the same fate. A person becomes a bonded labourer when . they are made to work as repayment for a loan. This loan is often taken out by a family member who has since died. There are no reliable statistics about the number of Pakistanis living and working as bonded labourers. But, . according to the National Coalition Against Bonded Labor, which is made . up of different organisations, they can be found across the country . working in agriculture, the carpet-making industry, brick kilns and . other industries. Amna Bhatti has spent half a century shaping mud into bricks in a huge kiln south of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. She started by paying off her parents' debt and now she's paying off her late husband's. She will probably spend the rest of her life as a bonded labourer. Mrs Bhatti was 10 when she started working at the kiln to pay off her parents' debt. Now, at 60, she is paying off the 250,000 rupees, around £1,500, her husband left behind when he died 12 years ago. Illegal: Brick factory worker Nusrat Azhar, 29, holding her daughter, Noor, one. She works with her sister . Shaziyya, 33, at a brick factory on the . outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan.

Rubina and . her husband are in debt to their employer the amount of 200,000 rupees, . about £1,200. The labourers often have no proper living facilities or basic amenities, such as running water or bathrooms . She has managed to cut 100,000 rupees . off that original loan, but has taken even more loans from her employer - so . it is doubtful she will ever escape the debt. Mrs Bhatti said: 'We are poor, and we will always stay poor. When you enter this road the only way out of it is death.' The labourers often have no proper living facilities or basic amenities, such as running water or bathrooms. They generally earn about 350 rupees per day for their hard work. This is a little over £2. Bonded labour is the most widely used method of enslaving people around the world. A person starts work to repay a loan, usually inherited from a family member. Hard worker: Maqbool Ghulam, 35, at the site of her . brick favtory in Mandra, near Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Maqbool and her husband are . in debt to their employer the amount of 250,000 rupees, about £1,500. Most bonded labourers earn just 350 rupees per day, which is just over £2 .

Emna . inherited her late husband's 95,000 . rupee debt to their employer. This is around £550. It is common for women to carry on working to repay a debt once the person who borrowed the money has died . The person is then tricked or trapped into working for very little or no pay, often for seven days a week. The value of their work over the years is usually more than the original amount of money borrowed. But often the debts are so hard to escape, that it is passed on to future generations. While working to repay debts their employer says they owe, the labourers are not allowed to work elsewhere. Poverty and threats of violence force . many bonded labourers to stay with their masters. If they left, they . would not otherwise be able to eat or have a place to sleep. Various forms of force can also be used to make sure they stay. In many cases they are kept under surveillance, sometimes under lock and key. Life sentence: Navila Shirali, 17, at the site of her work in Mandra, near Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Navila works to clear her father's debt to his employer, which is around 500,000 rupees, . nearly £3,000. Navila will probably be working to repay the debt for the rest of her life . Fearful: Khurshid Mumtaz, 25, a Pakistani brick factory worker, comforts her . crying daughter Haima, 4, at the site of her work in Mandra, near . Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Khurshid and her husband are in debt to their . employer the amount of 194,000 rupees, about £1,200. Women continue to work out of fear of poverty or violence . The debts also play an large part in human trafficking. People who are offered a ‘job’ abroad often borrow big sums of money to pay the traffickers. These sums cover the costs of their journey as well as a fee for finding a ‘job’ and is often borrowed against their family house or business. But when it turns out that the promised job did not exist, the trafficked victim cannot leave until the debt is paid off. The victim might be threatened with violence, either on themselves or their families back home. Debt bondage was used as a means of trapping labourers into working on plantations in Africa, the Caribbean and South-East Asia, after the abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Ghaziya Iqbal, 35, breastfeeds her . child Farman, nine months old, at the site of her work on the outskirts . of Islamabad, Pakistan. Ghaziya and her husband are in debt to their . employer. They owe around 250,000 rupees, which is about £1,500 . Family suffering: Sofia Zahour, 25, a Pakistani brick factory worker, with her daughter Alina, 2, at the site of her work in . Mandra, near Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Sofia and her husband are in debt to their employer for 400,000 rupees, about £2,400 debt . In South Asia, it is rooted in the caste system and predominately affects Dalits, the lowest caste called Untouchables. It still exists in agriculture, brick kilns, mills and factories. Bonded labour also remains a problem in some regions of South America. In the Punjab region of India, hundreds of thousands men, women and children are forced to work as bonded labourers in quarries and brick kilns where they receive little or no pay in return for a loan, which is used for survival, including medical costs. Today the International Labour Organisation estimates a minimum of 11.7 million people are in forced labour in the Asia-Pacific region. Most of those are in debt bondage. Despite the fact that bonded labour is illegal, some governments are unwilling to enforce the law, or to ensure that those who profit from it are punished. Widespread discrimination against some social groups means they have limited access to justice, education and ways to get themselves out of poverty. Bonded labour exists in spite of being explicitly outlawed by the United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery (1956).","Muhammed Muheisen visited brick kilns to photograph terrible conditions faced by thousands of 'bonded labourers'

I hear that Prince Harry is planning to take Cressida Bonas to Balmoral this summer. It would be the 25-year-old dancer’s first visit to the Queen’s Scottish retreat and would be likely to involve a meeting with Her Majesty. ‘Prince Harry is expected to bring Cressida,’ a source at Balmoral tells me. ‘It is the talk of the estate.’ Good company: Cressida Bonas' maternal second great grandmother, Lady Georgiana Spencer-Churchill, was Winston Churchill's aunt. Miss Bonas is believed to have been in a relationship with Prince Harry since 2012 . Visits to the Queen’s 49,000-acre home in the Highlands are a rite of passage for any royal bride-to-be. Kate Middleton and her parents were invited to join Prince William on a private shooting party at Balmoral in October 2010. William and Kate’s engagement was announced the following month. The Middletons spent the weekend at Birkhall, Prince Charles’s private residence on the Balmoral estate, which is where Cressida is expected to stay with Harry. William and Kate cemented their relationship at Balmoral, where they were given use of a cottage to spend weekends together while they were students at St Andrews University. Last Friday, Cressida attended her first public engagement with Harry, at the WE Day UK youth event at Wembley Arena. While the couple have been secretive in the past, arriving separately at parties, this time they were happy to be photographed cuddling and displaying open signs of affection. Yesterday they were pictured enjoying the rugby at Twickenham. The daughter of businessman Jeffrey Bonas and the aristocratic former model Lady Mary Gaye Curzon has been courting Harry for almost two years. Their relationship survived the Prince’s four-month posting to Afghanistan. Courting: The couple attended the England v Wales Six Nations rugby match at Twickenham at the weekend . Last October, it was reported that Cressida had finally overcome her reservations about marrying into the Royal Family. ‘Cressie is going to marry Harry,’ one of her friends told a broadsheet newspaper. ‘Harry never stops talking about marriage and children, and she has now got used to the idea. The wedding is likely to take place next year.’ The Prince turns 30 in September and many of his closest friends are now married or engaged. A Buckingham Palace spokesman says: ‘We would never comment on any private engagements.’ A source close to Cressida tells me: ‘I think it is too early in the year for a formal invitation to have been made.’","Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas photographed enjoying rugby yesterday .

Lucrative pay deal: Martin Bean is one of the highest-paid university chiefs despite falling numbers . The head of the Open University is seeking a £45,000-a-year aide to write his speeches despite his own £407,000 pay packet. The bumper pay deal handed to Martin Bean fuelled growing anger last night over the size of salaries enjoyed by university chiefs and expanding higher education bureaucracies. Since Mr Bean took over at the OU in 2009, student numbers have slumped by more than 50,000 and tuition fees more than tripled – a bigger relative increase than at any conventional university. He took home £351,000 in 2012/13, swollen by his pension to £407,000, which made him one of the highest-paid university vice-chancellors in the country. Now it has emerged Mr Bean, an Australian-born former Microsoft executive, has advertised for a ‘speechwriter’ on a salary of £37,756 to £45,053-a-year. The chosen candidate, who will be the second holder of the post, will ‘be responsible for researching, writing and editing all of the vice-chancellor’s speeches, explaining often complex ideas in an engaging and inspirational way’. Mr Bean is unusual among vice-chancellors in not having an academic background. Instead he worked for education and technology firms including Microsoft, where he was responsible for developing and marketing education products. The pay of his predecessor, Professor Brenda Gourley, was £309,000 when she left in 2009, 24 per cent less than Mr Bean’s. Controversies during his tenure include the decision to more than treble tuition fees, from £1,540 for a full-time degree to £5,000 a year, and part-time courses from around £700 to £2,500. Controversies during Mr Bean's tenure since 2009 include more than tripling the fees from £1,540 to £5,000 a year . It prompted claims the university, set . up in 1969 to help those who may have missed out on educational . opportunities earlier in their lives, had ‘sold out’ its founding . principles. Mr Bean’s £407,000 package is 11 per cent higher than in 2011/12. The university said this was because he took a pay cut of 10 per cent in 2010 ‘amid great uncertainty over future funding’. In 2012/13, the year the fee increase kicked in, his salary was restored to the full rate. The OU said this was because it was ‘well prepared for the new funding environment’. In a speech last year, Mr Bean – or possibly his previous speechwriter – said a new OU-led ‘FutureLearn’ initiative to put vast numbers of courses online would allow students to escape the authority of ‘The Man’, or in other words, a university that tells students ‘you’re a failure because you didn’t do what we said’. He added: ‘We’re going to let people set their own targets.’ Ministers have repeatedly called for universities to show ‘restraint’ when awarding pay to senior figures. Yet vice-chancellors in the 24-strong Russell Group of leading universities took home average pay rises of £22,000 in the last academic year, taking their earnings, including salary and pension, to £318,500. Professor David Eastwood, vice-chancellor of Birmingham University, is thought to have one of the highest basic salaries, at £400,000. Sally Hunt, of the University College Union, which represents lecturers and other academic staff, said: ‘In a year when fees have tripled and pay for other university staff continues to fall, these salary hikes will be particularly galling.’ In 2010, Business Secretary Vince Cable warned vice-chancellors’ pay bore ‘no relation to the underlying economics of the country’. An OU spokesman said: ‘The salary offered Martin Bean reflects the scale and complexity of the job. ‘Under Martin’s leadership, the OU has maintained its place as one of the highest ranked institutions for student satisfaction in the UK, kept its fees among the lowest in the county and brought together leading UK universities to form FutureLearn.’ He said Mr Bean had spoken at more than 50 events around the world in the past 12 months, and received 200 speaking requests a year.","Martin Bean is the third-highest paid university executive in the UK .

A California board has again approved parole for former Charles Manson follower and convicted double murderer Bruce Davis. The department of corrections first granted the 71-year-old parole in 2012, but Governor Jerry Brown vetoed the decision after a public outcry and opposition from the families of Manson victims. Brown now has 30 days to decide whether he'll oppose the decision again. Paid the price? Charles Manson follower Bruce Davis (left as he appears now and right after the 1969 double murder) was convicted of double homicide and has been in prison in California since. He was deemed suitable for parole once again . The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation granted parole to Davis after a hearing Wednesday at the California Men's Colony. The decision is subject to a 120-day decision review period, reports NBC News. Brown spokesman Jim Evans said in an email Wednesday that he could not comment beyond the parole board's statement. Davis has been in prison since he was convicted of aiding in the murders of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea in 1972 in a case that was a postscript to Manson's notorious reign as leader of the murderous cult known as the Manson family. Brown rejected the original parole it last March, saying he wanted Davis to reveal more details about the killings. Governor . Arnold Schwarzenegger blocked Davisâ€™s release years before that, saying . he â€˜would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society.â€™ . The parole bid was opposed by a former Manson family member, Barbara Hoyt, as well as Sharon Tate's sister, Debra Tate. The 71-year-old Manson family member has won parole before, but seen it blocked by Governors Brown and Schwarzenegger . Frightening: Davis has been in prison since he was convicted of aiding in the murders of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea in 1972 in a case that was a postscript to Manson's notorious reign as leader of the murderous cult known as the Manson family . Davis long maintained he was a bystander in the killings of the two men but in recent years he acknowledged his shared responsibility because he was present. Davis became a born-again Christian in prison and ministered to other inmates, married and divorced a woman he met through the prison ministry, and has a grown daughter. Davis also earned a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy of religion. Few followers of the infamous Manson cult have been released from prison. Steve Grogan, who was convicted with Davis, was freed in 1985 after he led police to Shea's buried body. Lynette 'Squeaky' Fromme was released from prison in 2009 after serving time for the attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford. Manson and two of his followers, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, remain in prison for life in the Tate killings. Their co-defendant, Susan Atkins, died of cancer behind bars in 2009. Another of the Tate killers, Charles 'Tex' Watson, is still in prison. Opposition: Barbara Hoyt, left, a former member of the Manson Family, and Debra Tate, sister of Manson Family murder victim Sharon Tate, moments before the start of Bruce Davis' last parole hearing in 2012. Davis has long denied he ever actually killed anyone and was not present for Tate's murder . Manson and his 'Family' became some of the 20th century's most infamous criminals in the summer of 1969, when he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder seven people in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war between whites and blacks. Among the victims was actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski. She was stabbed 16 times by members of the cult in the early morning hours of August 9, 1969. Four other people were also stabbed or shot to death at Tate's home that night by the Manson followers, who scrawled the word ""Pig"" in blood on the front door before leaving. The following night, Manson's group stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death, using their blood to write ""Rise,"" ""Death to Pigs"" and ""Healter Skelter"" - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song ""Helter Skelter"" - on the walls and refrigerator door. Davis did not take part in those murders. Manson was originally sentenced to death for the murder spree that horrified the nation in the late 1960s but was spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional in 1972. Now 79, he is serving a life sentence at Corcoran State Prison for the seven Tate-LaBianca killings and the murder of Hinman. He has been repeatedly denied parole.","Bruce Davis, 71, was granted parole after a hearing at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo on Wednesday .

A California mother who gave up her first-born son nearly 50 years ago, met him for the first time this weekend in an emotional reunion. Raella Bodinus, 67, sobbed as she hugged her son Ken Drake at his home in Lindon, Utah. 'We've been waiting a long time for this,' she said. 'You look like one of my kids.' Bodinus was just 16-years-old when she gave birth to Drake in May 1964, at a home for teen mothers in Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . New family photo: Raella Bodinus (right) met her first-born son Ken Drake (center) in person for the first time on Friday after giving him up for adoption nearly 50 years ago. Pictured above with younger daughter Robin Ramirez, Drake's full biological sister . The out-of-wedlock pregnancy was covered up, as her family told everyone that she  attending a prep school in Washington State. Not even her boyfriend, Drake's biological father, knew where she was. The teen mother was never allowed to touch her infant son after he was born, as nurses quickly shuttled off the newborn to the nursery. In the end, Bodinus decided to give her son to another family in a closed adoption. 'It had been decided. I was hoping and praying he was with a good family, and I didnâ€™t want to impose,' Bodinus told the Salt Lake Tribune. The teen mom went on to marry birth-father Richard Bodinus in August 1965, a little over a year after giving birth to Ken, and the two went on to have two more children of their own - a daughter named Robin and a son named Ricky. Memories: After giving Drake up for adoption, Bodinus ended up marring his birth-father and they had two children of their own - a son named Ricky (left) and a daughter named Robin (right) Meanwhile, Drake grew up happy in Riverside, California with his parents and another adopted sister. He reconnected with his birth mother last month after submitting a DNA profile to genealogy site Ancestry.com and was received a 'close match' to Richard Larsen - his birth mother's brother and his biological uncle. Drake, now 49, says he wasn't out to find his birth mother, since his adopted sister became estranged after reuniting with her own birth mother. Happy life: Drake (left) grew up in Riverside, California with his parents and adopted sister. He is now 49-years-old and lives in Lindon, Utah where the reunion took place on Friday . 'The fallout from that was really bad,' Drake said. 'I never wanted to put my mom through that.' But he was interested in genealogy and submitted the profile to learn more about his ethnic background. He sent a message to Larsen after the match, and his uncle responded back just two days later saying he was '99 per cent sure' who his mother was. 'She would like you to contact her if you are OK with that,' Larsen wrote, adding a cell phone number. It was obvious once they started exchanging photos that the two were related, and they quickly planned a trip to Drake's home in Lindon, Utah to reconnect. Family resemblance? Bodinus married Drake's biological father in 1965 (left), but according to public records they no longer live together. On the right, her youngest son Ricky . Bodinus' daughter, and Drake's full biological sister, Robin Ramirez came along for the reunion as well which took place on Friday. During their weekend reunion, Ramirez discovered she shared her aversion to egg whites with her brother, while noting that brothers Ricky and Drake share musical talents. For Drake, meeting his mother for the first time made him finally understand the reasons why she had to give him up. 'I was naive,' Drake said, 'and I never really understood the social forces that shaped what my birth mom had to go through. I never really gave it any thought, and I feel guilty now because I never put myself in her place and imagined what she was feeling.'","Raella Bodinus was just 16 years old when she gave birth to son Ken Drake in May 1964 .

"PUBLISHED: . 17:31 EST, 11 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:48 EST, 11 March 2014 . Accused: Ryan Wyngarden goes on trial this week for the murder of his sister and her husband . The jury in the murder trial of a Michigan man accused of killing his sister and her husband for fear that she would reveal their incestuous love affair on Tuesday heard opening statements from the prosecution and the defense, which painted two very different pictures of the double homicide. Ryan Wyngarden, a 52-year-old married father-of-four from Zeeland, stands accused of shooting dead Gail and Rick Brink in their Park Township home in November 1987, only 18 months after their wedding. The prosecution in the case opened the trial Tuesday in Grand Haven by trying to convince the jury that the killings were premeditated – and that Wyngarden had admitted to his wife that he murdered the couple. Ottawa County Assistant Prosecutor Lee Fisher said in court that Mr Wyngarden was jealous of the relationship between his sister and her newlywed husband, and that the defendant was concerned that Gail Brink might reveal the truth about their sexual relationship. Wyngarden's defense team insisted that the 52-year-old man was innocent and had an alibi for the time of the murder, MLive.com. Defense attorney David Hall laid out a theory where a motorcycle gang with connections to a drug ring may have been behind the slayings. Day 1: Ryan Wyngarden appears in an an Ottawa County courtroom monitor during the opening his murder trial in Grand Haven, Michigan . The defense also insisted that no incest had occurred between the siblings during their teenage years. The case of Rick and Gail Brink laid unsolved until investigators decided to re-open it in 2011 and re-interview Wyngarden and his wife. At first, Pam Wyngarden stuck to the . story she had repeated for decades: that she and her husband were . visiting a friend's house, where they were babysitting the children, at . the time of the killings. But during interviews in January 2013, . the mother-of-four changed her story, saying that she could no longer hide his secret and claiming that her husband had . admitted to shooting dead the Brinks. At . a hearing in February 2013, she said they had only been dating a few . months when Ryan Wyngarden told her he had killed the couple because he . feared his sister would reveal they had had a sexual relationship as . teenagers. 'I was concerned that I would go to jail... because I was holding this information for so long,' she said, Michigan Live reported. 'I told myself I can't have this burden on my shoulders. I can't live with this.' Killed: Rick and Gail Brink were shot dead in their home in November 1987, 18 months after they married . Victims: Wyngarden allegedly shot the couple because he was worried she would reveal they had sex as teens . At a hearing last year, she recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders in November 1987, just three months after they first started dating. 'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, ""What's wrong?"" and he said, ""I shot and killed Rick and Gail"". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.' When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said. Mrs Wyngarden explained that this intimate relationship had been a sexual one. She said she married him regardless of . his confession because she craved love and support for her and her two . children, one of whom was his. According to the prosecution, Mrs Wyngarden told detectives that her husband brought her to his late sister's home and showed her where Gail and her husband were killed. Afterwards, the 52-year-old man allegedly warned her: 'If you ever tell anyone about this, the same thing is going to happen to you.' Wyngarden sits behind a photo of murder victims Gail and Rick Brink shown on an Ottawa County courtroom monitor . Prosecutor Doug Mesman shows photos of the Brink family during questioning of witness Bud Brink during the murder trial of Ryan Wyngarden . Pam Wyngarden is expected to take the stand and testify against her husband as the star witness for the prosecution. Fisher told the jurors Tuesday that the married woman will talk about how her husband allegedly left angry voicemails for investigators after they questioned the couple in October 2012. Mr Hall, who represents Wyngarden, said in court that his client stills stands by his alibi. In his opening statement, the defense attorney raised the possibility that the Brinks couple may have been victims in a case of mistaken identity. According to Hall, the previous owners of Gail and Rick's Park Township home, who had moved out not long before the murders, had been linked to narcotics trade and had connections to a Detroit-area biker gang. The previous homeowner, who was said to be a one-time police informant, is expected to testify during the trial as a witness for the defense. The trial is expected to last two weeks. Wyngarden remains in the Ottawa County Jail. Revelations: Pam Wyngarden, pictured in court last year after the case was re-opened, told investigators that her husband had admitted to killing the couple and she agreed to help him cover it up . Denial: Wyngarden sobbed throughout the hearing in February 2013 and yelled that he was not guilty . In the years after Wyngarden allegedly . told his wife about the murder, he demanded she kept it a secret and . would not allow her to have any friends in fear that she would tell . them, she said. As she spoke in court last year, her husband sobbed and shouted: 'How can you say these things? I didn't kill them, I didn't!' But Crystal Beelen, a former girlfriend of . Wyngarden's, also testified that Wyngarden admitted that . he had had a sexual relationship with his sister when they were . teenagers. The bodies of Rick, 28, and Gail Brink, 22, were found by Rick's parents, Isla and Bud Brink, after he failed to show up for work. The couple had last been seen two days before at a wedding. In the hearing last year, Mrs Brink said she found her daughter-in-law on the bed with a pillow over her head and multiple gun wounds. Her son was also found shot dead in his truck outside the home. Happier times: Pam Wyngarden, pictured, said her husband, right, became controlling because he worried she would share his secret. Last year, she said she said she could no longer hide the truth . The couple had been married less than 18 months at the time of their deaths. The case fell cold as investigators found . no apparent motives and believed that the Brinks could have been . victims of mistaken identity. Ottawa County Sheriff's Capt. Mark Bennett told Michigan Live . that several civilians, retired officers and sheriff's detectives are . expected to return to the town to testify about the on-scene . investigation. The trial is expected to take at least two weeks. If convicted, Wyngarden would face a sentence of life in prison.","Ryan Wyngarden charged with shooting dead Rick and Gail Brink in 1987 because he was jealous of their relationship .

The Texas church led by Joel Osteen had $600,000 in donations stolen and in reporting the theft they revealed the staggering amount of money was their total from just one weekend of services. The televangelist's church was targets sometime between the last service on Sunday night and 8.30am on Monday when an employee discovered the break in. In addition to cash, the burglars took Lakewood Church's checks and deposit slips that listed parishioners' credit card information. Scroll down for video . Devoted followers: Joel Osteen's church has a massive following with a regular weekly attendance of about 43,500 and millions of supporters who watch the broadcasted sermons . Packed house: Lakewood Church is housed in a former sports stadium and holds 16,800 people at a time . Local station KENS5 reports that the stolen collection did not account for all of the money that the church made that weekend, however. Any donations that were made online or via drop box were not taken, though the church did not state how much the untouched total amounted to. 'We were heartbroken to learn today that funds were stolen from the church over the weekend,' read a note released to followers. 'This includes cash, checks and envelopes containing written credit card information, and it is limited only to those funds contributed in the church services on Saturday, March 8 and Sunday, March 9, 2014.' Fox News reported that the figure totaled $600,000. Lakewood Church itself chose not to release the numbers and said that the amount in the safe had not yet been counted so they are unsure how the figure was reached. The donation funds are fully insured so Lakewood Church will not lose out on the funds. Crime scene: An employee discovered that the church safe had been broken into when they arrived for work Monday morning. Online donations and those left in collection boxes were not affected . 'Lakewood Church is working in conjunction with the Houston Police Department to investigate this matter. We do not want to compromise the investigation by commenting at this time,' church spokesman Donald Iloff Jr. told The Houston Chronicle. 'The funds were fully insured, and we are working with our insurance company to restore the stolen funds to the church.' The Houston church has a weekly attendance of about 43,500 parishioners. Services are held in an old sports arena which seats 16,800 at a time but that does not account for the thousands of viewers who watch during their live-streamed broadcasts which airs on Fox, ABC and USA networks depending on the region. The donations may have been heightened last weekend in particular because it was the first Sunday of Lent.","Safe at the Houston megachurch was broken into meaning that cash, checks and credit card slips from masses on March 8 and 9 were stolen .

The dog was found nursing the tiny kitten on a night when temperatures fell below freezing and would have died without the dog's help. Scroll down for video . Best friends: A long-haired Chihuahua and a tiny gray kitten from California are looking for a new home after being abandoned by their previous owners. Friendly fur: Beignet the dog adopted Gumbo the kitten after they were abandoned by their owners . What a couple! The two have been aptly named for their Mardi Gras debut - the pup is now called Beignet and her kitten son is known as Gumbo . Now an animal shelter, the Helen Woodward Center in Rancho Santa Fe is seeking a home for the unlikely pair that has redefined the mother and son bond. Beignet and Gumbo’s remarkable story began when neighbors reported hearing what sounded like a relocated family’s abandoned dog tending to a new puppy in their former backyard. With evening temperatures falling to 20 degrees, efforts were made to rescue the canine family. Instead of a new puppy, however, the mother dog was found nursing an abandoned kitten. The animal shelter says the duo have provided a great deal of inspiration. Mardi Gras parade: 'They love each other. That's all there is to it. It's not complicated,' said the center's inventory manager, Labeth Thompson. 'They needed each other and they were there for each other' Staying put: Kitten Gumbo stays near his mother¿s side . Symbolic: The two have been aptly named for their Mardi Gras debut - the pup is now called Beignet and her kitten son is known as Gumbo . 'The strength, nourishment and incredible comfort the two had provided to one other during their time alone was miraculous and their bond was beautiful. The road traveled by an orphan animal is often filled with mistreatment, loneliness and fear. How each of these creatures adapts to their challenging circumstances becomes a major factor in their unique personalities and often leaves rescue workers inspired by their unwavering ability to accept, love and trust. Side by side: Beignet and Gumbo keep close for comfort . Beignet is 19 months old and Gumbo is 5-months-old. They spend 95% of the day snuggling together. 'This incredible little family really demonstrates the pure hearts of the orphan animals we meet each day,' said Helen Woodward Animal Center Inventory Manager LaBeth Thompson. 'They love each other.  That’s all there is to it.  It’s not complicated.  They needed each other and they were there for each other.' The story has generated a number of comments from readers, many of whom are pet owners. 'I wish these two well, and hope someone can open up their home to these two awesome little guys and give them the love they deserve,' wrote one commentator. Others voiced anger: 'These people will get whats coming to them. No excuse for leaving or abandoning animals. Just shows their true character,' said one pet love. Looking for love: Beignet and Gumbo hope to be relocated to a new home. Either way, they will be moving together . 'I would love to know the name of the family who left them behind to freeze and starve. I would post their names all over Facebook for their disgusting, indecent behavior! Rather than find them a home or at the very least drop them at a shelter, they abandoned them? Low life's!' The Helen Woodward Animal Center said there has been international interest from Switzerland, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Australia, Mexico, Chile and Finland. The center is requiring a 300 word (or less) essay from potential suitors. 'We want to make sure that the next part of their lives is absolutely perfect and filled with devotion and kindness,' center employee Shannon Bush said in the statement. 'They deserve it. They embody love and comfort and it's time they received it in return.'

The action star's airliner thriller Non-Stop arrived in first place at the weekend box office, effectively ending the Warner Bros. animated film's three-week blockade at the top spot. Non-Stop ascended in its first weekend . with $30 million domestically and $20 million internationally, according . to studio estimates on Sunday. The Universal film stars Neeson as a federal air marshal on a doomed flight. 'I think the fact that audiences were ready for a suspense thriller has a lot to do with the film's success, and obviously Liam is an absolute box office draw,' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal. Scroll down for video . Suspense: Non-Stop, starring Liam Neeson, is about a U.S. Air Marshall on a hijacked plane and took over $30M at the weekend to debut at No. 1 . Critics have called the film 'brilliant' and 'a great plane ride', but unrealistic . The film, which was shot in New York on an estimated budget of $50 million, co-stars Julianne Moore as the passenger Neeson's character sits next to on the plane . 'One of the main reasons people were coming to see the film was Liam.' Fox's Son of God debuted closely behind Non-Stop in second place with $26.5 million domestically. The film recounts the story of Jesus' life using footage from the production of History Channel's 10-part miniseries The Bible. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak, noted it was a strong showing because box office predictions for Son of God were wildly varied. 'It's difficult to track religious- and faith-based films, as we learned with The Passion of the Christ,' Dergarabedian said. 'If the expectation is that Hollywood should make more movies like this, then the audiences who want these movies have to vote with their dollars. It's only then that Hollywood will wake up and see this as a viable genre that people will want to see.' Son of God, which features Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado in the role of Jesus, is the first of several religious-themed films set for release this year, including next month's Noah starring Russell Crowe and Exodus with Christian Bale planned for December. The Lego Movie, which features the voices of Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks as characters from the block-building toy franchise, came in third place with $21 million in its third weekend, bringing its total domestic haul to $209.3 million. After three weeks at No. 1, Lego Movie landed in third place at the weekend with $21 million in revenue. It has generated $209 million domestically so far . Lego Movie also earned $21 million from 52 international territories. A few contenders up for Oscars at Sunday's 86th annual Academy Awards received a boost at the box office. Dergarabedian said the box office for 12 Years a Slave was up 72 percent and for Dallas Buyers Club was up 44 percent over last weekend. Both films are vying for the best-picture trophy at the Oscars, as well as several other honors. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak.

A Tennessee man has pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping and killing 20-year-old nursing student Holly Bobo who disappeared three years ago. In the days following suspect Zachary Adams' arrest, authorities have been tight-lipped about evidence in the investigation, saying only that it is ongoing. Adams appeared in a Decatur County courtroom Tuesday and was arraigned on charges of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder. Entering his plea: Adams was arrested on a separate aggravated assault charge before his March 5 indictment for the then-20-year-old's 2011 disappearance . Heartbreaking: Karen Bobo (seen with attorney Steve Farese) was in the court as Adams entered his plea, and she was seen wearing a pink bracelet since that is the last color she was seen wearing . Adams was shackled at the wrists and wore a black and gray striped shirt during the hearing, which lasted less than five minutes. Relatives and friends of Bobo attended the hearing, including Holly's father Dana and mother Karen. Both were seen wearing pink bracelet's in their daughter's honor, as that was the color she was last seen wearing. Missing presumed dead: Holly Bobo's brother told police that he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her away into the woods on April 13, 2011 . Karen broke down in tears at the end of the Tuesday hearing. Attorney . Jennifer Lynn Thompson entered the plea on Adams' behalf. Circuit Court . Judge Charles Creed McGinley asked Adams if he understood the charges, . and Adams replied, 'Yes, sir.' Attention in the case was revived about two weeks ago, when authorities searched property near Adams' home in the Holladay community, about 15 miles from Bobo's home. Adams was arrested on a separate aggravated assault charge before his indictment March 5. Before he was charged with Bobo's murder, Adams told The Jackson Sun 'I'm not the one.' Adams has a list of prior charges in several West Tennessee jurisdictions, including driving without a license, disorderly conduct, probation violation, drug possession and assault. Records show he served six months in jail for shooting his mother in the knee in 2004 with a handgun. In court documents in that case, his stepfather Joseph King said his family feared for their lives. 'He shot his mother point blank ... and is a danger to us and the community and our relatives,' King wrote. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn did not say during last week's news conference whether Adams knew Bobo. Bobo's family said in a statement after the charges were announced that their faith will give them the strength to see them through the ordeal. 'In the recent days, it feels like everything has come against our hope and it seems that all our trust was shattered,' the statement said. Taking him in: Adams has a string of prior arrests ranging from assault and DUI to prison time for shooting his mother in the knee in 2004 with a handgun . Questions: Police have still not revealed why they believe Adams is connected to Bobo's disappearance . Outside the courthouse, Memphis attorney Steve Farese said the Bobo family was doing as well as can be expected. 'It will help them if a conviction is had and the facts and circumstances are brought to light,' said Farese, who is representing the family. Farese said he expects 'bits and pieces' of information to be released in coming weeks. An April 9 status hearing has been set. Nashville defense attorney David Raybin, a former prosecutor, said the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation must have had some sort of break in the case, given the recent flurry of activity, including multiple search warrants. Mr Raybin said prosecutors may have decided to charge Adams because they didn't want the case to get any colder. Standing strong: Holly's father Dana Bobo, also seen wearing a pink bracelet, was in court but like the rest of Holly's relatives, he did not issue any statements . 'They may have concluded that they will never find a body and the case is not going to get any stronger,' Mr Raybin said. 'Witnesses die and evidence evaporates. It could be that it was now or never.' No clues: Bobo's family said in a statement after the charges were announced that their faith will give them the strength to see them through the ordeal . Residents in the town of Parsons, near where Bobo disappeared in West Tennessee, are looking for closure. 'There's a lot of unanswered questions,' said Ronda Philpott, who attended the school where Bobo's mother taught. 'At this point in time, it's believed that Holly's deceased and the most important thing now is for her poor family to have some peace.' Prosecutors are considering asking for the death penalty if they get a conviction. Adams is the only suspect named by authorities since Bobo disappeared on the morning of April 13, 2011, outside her home near Parsons, about 120 miles northeast of Memphis. Her brother told police that he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her away into the woods. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, local law enforcement and privately-hired search teams have looked for Bobo over the years. Relatives and friends held out hope that Bobo would be found alive like Elizabeth Smart, who was kidnapped and held captive for nine months when she was 14 in Utah. Smart even spoke at Bobo's high school in August 2012. As searchers scoured thick woods, old barns and open fields, townspeople adorned light poles, mailboxes and storefronts with pink bows because Bobo was last seen wearing a pink shirt and carrying a pink purse.","Zachary Adams has entered a plea of innocence after being charged with the kidnapping and first degree murder of Holly Bobo .

Trembley, a World War II veteran, tried to avoid Frost but the skydiver's parachute cables got tangled in the plane's propeller catching Frost and causing the small Cessna to nose dive. Miraculously, both men escaped the crash with only minor injuries and have already been released by the hospital. Scroll down for video .

The collision happened Saturday, just as Frost was landing from a skydive and Trembley was touching down on the runway . In an interview on GMA, Frost described the startling moment he realized he was about to be hit by an airplane. 'All of a sudden, I look over to my right and there was an aircraft coming at me. I realized that I was going to have an impact and I scrunched up and prepared for being hit,' Frost recalled. Frost was then pulled backwards as his parachute got wrapped around the wing of Trembley's plane. As the small aircraft wheeled around and nosedived onto the runway, Frost was launched into the air. The collision, which took place about 75 feet in the air, was captured in a dramatic series of photos by Tim Telford, who sensed something bad was going to happen when he heard the plane coming in as the skydivers were landing.

Frost says he never imagined such a thing could happen to him, but he says the crash won't keep him from skydiving again. 'As soon as I feel safe to jump again, I'll be up there,' he said. After the crash, Frost was left sore and bruised but escaped breaking any bones or suffering internal injuries. Trembley was a bit more beat up after the crash - cracking his trachea. He also needed five stitches on his chin, but has since been released from the hospital as well. In an interview with WTVT after being released, Trembley said neither he or Frost would be alive today if it weren't for his fast thinking. 'I pulled back on the stick to make the airplane go up and not him him. If I hadn't have thought fast enough myself, he would've been dead,' Trembley said.

A disgusted mother opened a jar of baby food for her eight-month-old son and found it covered in green mould. Laura Rees, 31, had stocked up on ten 89p jars of HiPP baby food at her local Tesco branch to feed her toddler Lennon. But a week later she took the lid off one of the organic Parsnip, Potato and Turkey Casseroles and was greeted with a patch of mould on the food. Mrs Rees has been offered a refund and an apology by Tesco and is now sending the rogue jar to the manufacturers to investigate. Sickened: Laura Rees with the mouldy baby food from HiPP Organic and her toddler Lennon . She said: 'I was nearly sick because of the smell. It's so scary. 'We go out of our way to spend extra money for organic food and you put your trust in these companies to give you the good nutrients your baby needs. 'If it was adult food it's unacceptable but it's worse because it is baby food. 'Tesco can only do so much because you can't see it from the outside so I'm blaming the manufacturers for their quality control because it should not have happened. 'I want them to accept they have done something wrong and to make sure their quality control is more watertight so it doesn't happen again.' Mrs Rees bought the food from a Tesco near her home in Leighton Buzzard, Bedforshire, and it was within its sell-by-date. Grim find: The mouldy baby food from HiPP Organic'­s . A spokesman for the manufacturers said the jar must have lost its air vacuum and let oxygen get in and form a mould on the food. They said: 'At HiPP we take huge pride in our quality control procedures and therefore take complaints of this nature extremely seriously. 'Mould can only ever grow in the presence of oxygen, which would suggest that this jar had lost vacuum prior to the opening of it. 'We do believe that HiPP baby foods are produced to the most rigorous standards within the industry, and after the heat treatment process is completed to preserve the baby food, there is no possibility of mould entering the product unless the jar loses vacuum. Mrs Rees bought the food from a Tesco near her home in Leighton Buzzard, Bedforshire, and it was within its sell-by-date . 'We have spoken to Ms Rees who has agreed to send us the sample of the product in question and explained that upon receiving the product we will start a full internal investigation to try and determine why the vacuum seal on this jar has failed and send her a full report of our findings. 'We can confirm that we have not received any other complaints on this product.' Tesco said: 'We expect all the branded products we sell to meet our high standards and we were concerned to learn of this issue. 'Our Customer Service Team has asked Mrs Rees for further details and to return the product so that we can thoroughly investigate with the brand supplier to see what might have happened.

A teenager from north London has been charged with robbery after an alleged attempted raid at a jewellers yards from Buckingham Palace was foiled by a member of the Royal Household. Kaneen Gopaul, 18, from Islington, will appear before Wimbledon Magistrates Court today accused of robbery and handling stolen goods. The charges came a day after a gang of alleged would-be thieves pulled up on a motorbike and scooter outside H Stain jewellers in Victoria armed with axes and sledgehammers and tried to smash the glass windows. A passer-by, believed to be a member of the Royal Household working at Buckingham Palace, grabbed a man by his hoodie, bundled him to the ground and kept him restrained until police arrived, while the rest of the bungling raiders rode off. Caught: Four men allegedly attempted to break into H Stain jewellers - one suspect was held down by a passer-by . Pinned down: The four men were said to have been wielding axes.

Location: This map shows Buckingham Palace in the top centre, while H Stain Ltd is just yards down the road . The passer-by, who did not want to be named, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It was like watching a scene from a Guy Ritchie movie.’ He . added: ‘When they tried to zoom off I grabbed one by . the hoodie. Not putting his hoodie up was a fatal mistake as it gave me . something to get hold of. ‘He . swore at me and I managed to yank him off his machine. I thought: ""This . is my bloody city - why should thugs like this get away with it?""

Sean Roberts, 14, has been suspended from classes at Wellington Academy, Wiltshire, and told he must attend the school¿s ¿department for naughty kids¿ . A boy has been suspended from classes for five days after he called a teacher by his Christian name outside of school hours. Sean Roberts, 14, has been banned from Wellington Academy in the mornings and in the afternoons he must attend the school’s ‘department for naughty kids’. The school in Tidworth, Wiltshire, is sponsored by Wellington College and its executive head is political historian Dr Anthony Seldon. Yesterday, Sean’s mother Julie Roberts, 42, demanded her son be allowed back in class ‘as the punishment is over the top’. She claimed the Academy was ‘making an example' of her son. Hairdresser Mrs Roberts - who has already lost 106 pounds in wages staying at home to look after him - said she was only told about the punishment in an evening phone call from the teacher Head of Department Barry Seymour . 'This happened in the village where we live - it was outside of school. My son was walking home and my son shouted out to him Hi Barry. Barry followed him and challenged him at school the next day and my son said he did it. 'Then I had a phone call telling me my son was not allowed in school for five days but I have had nothing in writing and no official meeting. The night he called the punishment was due to start the next day. 'The teacher involved said to me your son shouted my name in a way that made me feel small and undermined. I said to him because I know this guy ‘come on Barry he is a 14 year old kid - you should not be intimidated by a 14 year old. Is that all he said and he said yes. 'I would have thought if they were sanctioning something so serious then I would have been called in for a meeting and laid out on the table what was going to happen - a structured plan. But I have had nothing - just a phone call from the teacher involved. I have had nothing in writing. 'I said to the guy on the phone that night when does this start and he said tomorrow. I said to him why are you phoning me? Why is the Principle not phoning me? You have a partial view you are the victim. You should not be phoning me. 'I said I have clients booked in and I am a single parent with a mortgage and three kids. I just cannot afford to cut clients. I have lost about 106 pounds. Ben Bond - who is Vice Principal of the Academy, pictured - confirmed the boy was now subject to ¿five days alternative learning¿ following the incident . 'I stayed at home the first morning to look after him but then I had to leave him in the house on his own but I did not want too. I had to go to work.' Principle Michael Milner was yesterday unavailable for comment. But Ben Bond - who is Vice Principal of the Academy - admitted the boy was now subject to ‘five days alternative learning’ which was a ‘relatively new sanction’ for what he had done. And he admitted the comment may have been made ‘on the High Street’ outside of school hours. But he stressed: 'He has been sanctioned for an accumulation of incidents. It was not a one off - it was a tipping point. Over a period of time there are a number of young people and Sean is one of them who have been involved in repeated and systematic undermining of staff by shouting things behind backs and under breath. 'The five days alternative learning is not simply because he said Barry to a member of staff in the street. Shouting someone’s name however jovial it might be in a group situation it is it not as abstract from the parents point of view . 'We acted proportionately. But I do take that procedurally things need to be improved.There was an error - we should have made contract with mum.' A recent OFSTED report says it required improvement.","Wiltshire schoolboy Sean Roberts, 14, suspended from classes .

When Rena Nathanson invented Bananagrams, the struggling single mother could not have dreamed how fruitful it would become. The word game is Amazon UK’s bestselling toy of all time, and more than six million have been sold worldwide. The business began in a kitchen in East Sheen, West London, after Miss Nathanson came up with the game to entertain her two young children after her 15-year marriage ended. Scroll down for video . Mumpreneur: Rena Nathanson, 51, created Bananagrams in her kitchen and now the £14.99 game has sold over six million worldwide . The 51-year-old and her father, Abe, . invented a game in which players race to make word grids out of letter . tiles. It comes in a banana-shaped pouch and is similar to Scrabble, but . without a board. Seven years on, American-born Miss Nathanson lives in the same three-bedroom home with children Ava, now 15, and Aaron, 18. She said: ‘It started out as a bit of fun. But the first 50 sold out immediately, so we had 500 made. ‘After . that I carried on distributing from my kitchen. Everything in the shed . had to be moved and the house was taken over by Bananagrams. I drove my . kids mad. 'It . was sort of make or break.

I had to make something happen. ‘I started selling to independent toy shops in the UK and Ireland, and in 2008 Bananagrams was picked up by Amazon. ‘This year it was the top seller of all time. I’m pretty proud of that.’ Success: Today it is Amazon UK's top selling game of all time and it has turned creator Rena from a struggling single mother-of-two into a millionaire . Family: American-born Rena lives in London with her two children Ava, 15, and Aaron, 18 . Overnight success: The game she invented for a bit of fun with the family has proved to be more fruitful than she could have imagined . The . former graphic designer, who starts her day at 7.30 to take Ava to . school and often works into the early hours, said: ‘Bananagrams has . given me financial stability and that’s how it has changed my life. ‘For the first time in forever I can say I have a grown-up car where  the windows actually go up and down by themselves.’ Amazon . UK named the £14.99 game its bestselling toy of all time on its 15th . anniversary, and it is rumoured that the cast of Downton Abbey play . during filming. Miss Nathanson said: ‘I think it’s awesome. I love Downton Abbey. It’s the best compliment.’ The . mother started her enterprise from the kitchen of her home in East . Sheen and still fits school runs, cooking and cleaning around hectic . business meetings and work calls. Now . the Bananagrams range has sold six million across 31 countries and is . available in the UK at John Lewis, WHSmith, Waterstones, Tesco, . Sainsburys and Waitrose. It is even rumored that the cast of Downton Abbey play Bananagrams during filming. The American-born entrepreneur said: 'The cast of Downton are huge fans, it's very exciting that they have it on set. 'One of the cast members got it and brought it on set and it became a craze. I think it's awesome. I love Downton Abbey. It's the best compliment.' Rena first came up with the idea for the game with her late father, Abe, when her children were still young. The aim is to race against other players to build crossword grids out of letter tiles. It was such a hit with family and friends that Rena and Abe decided to make 50 prototypes to sell - and they were an instant success. Gone bananas! Rena said everything in the shed had to be moved and the house was taken over by Bananagrams. 'I drove my kids mad,' she laughed (pictured: A collect photo of Aaron at home) Working mother: Rena starts her day at 7:30am to take Ava to school, and works tirelessly until the early hours as she liaises with her team of 25 in the US . She said: 'It started out as a bit of fun - nothing serious, just a game. But the first 50 sold out immediately so we had 500 made. 'I then had 5,000 games made for the London Toy Fair in 2006 - we were inundated with orders. 'After that I carried on selling in the UK distributing from my kitchen. Everything in the shed had to be moved and the house was taken over by Bananagrams. I drove my kids mad. 'I started selling to independent toy shops in the UK and Ireland and in 2008 Banangrams was picked up by Amazon. 'We've been selling strongly on there for years now but this year it was the top seller of all time. I'm pretty proud of that.' Where it all began: It started out as a bit of fun with the family but the first 50 they produced sold out immediately so Rena and her late father (centre) had 500 made . Home: Rena, pictured with her children at home where she works from, said: 'It is a bit of a double-edged sword: it's great because I'm always around for the children but I can't get away from work' Rena starts her day at 7:30am to take Ava to school, and works tirelessly until the early hours as she liaises with her team of 25 in the US. She said: 'It is a bit of a double-edged sword. It's great because I'm always around for the children but I can't get away from work. 'I can keep overheads down but also take the kids to school and I'm still there for them - although I get constant interruptions. 'I say to them, if the door is closed pretend I'm not in the building!'. Before starting Bananagrams, Rena had jobs in graphic design, and once managed an art gallery, but raising two children on one wage was a struggle. Now, despite making her fortune, she isn't flash with her cash, and still lives in the same three-bedroom house. Bright spark: Rena first came up with the idea for the game with her late father, Abe, pictured second from left, when her children were still young . She said: 'I live in the same house I moved into before I gave birth to my son 18 years ago and I love my family home. 'Bananagrams has given me financial stability and that's how it has changed my life. I can pay my bills. 'For the first time in forever I can say I have a grown-up car where the windows actually go up and down by themselves.' Her hard work and tireless efforts have allowed Rena to provide a better life for her children and both Ava and Aaron were moved into private schools. Rena is also happy to be able to support a number of different cancer charities in memory of her late father. Comfortable: Rena, who used to shop in bargain basements, says she loves not having to worry about money . Players: To this day, Rena, Ava and Aaron are still big fans of Bananagrams . And instead of counting the pennies, Rena is now able to splash out on holidays with her friends and thinks nothing of flying back and forth between the UK and her native America. She said: 'I used to look for bargains and two-for-ones in the supermarket and now I just go and get what I like and it's a big difference.' But despite her success, Rena is careful with her newfound wealth. She said: 'I'm not stupid or careless but it's nice to not have to worry about it. Even shopping for clothes and things like that, I don't have to give it much thought now.' To this day, Rena, Ava and Aaron are still big fans of Bananagrams. Rena said: 'We all still play it, especially in America with my mum and other family. It really has been a huge source of fun for us all.'","Rena Nathanson, 51, created Bananagrams in kitchen .

A man accused of shooting dead his sister and her husband out of fear she would reveal their incestuous sexual relationship is set to go on trial 26 years later - after his wife told investigators he had admitted to the killing. Ryan Wyngarden, a 51-year-old married father-of-four, will appear in court in Grand Haven in Ottawa County, Michigan on Tuesday for the first day of his murder trial. The case of Rick and Gail Brink, who were . found shot dead at their home in November 1987, laid unsolved until investigators decided to re-open it in 2011 and re-interview Wyngarden and his wife. At first, Pam Wyngarden stuck to the . story she had repeated for decades: That she and her husband were . visiting a friend's house, where they were babysitting the children, at . the time of the killings. But during interviews in January 2013, . the mother-of-four changed her story, saying that she could no longer hide his secret and claiming that her husband had . admitted to shooting dead the Brinks. At . a hearing in February 2013, she said they had only been dating a few . months when Ryan Wyngarden told her he had killed the couple because he . feared his sister would reveal they had had a sexual relationship as . teenagers. 'I was concerned that I would go to jail... because I was holding this information for so long,' she said, Michigan Live reported. 'I told myself I can't have this burden on my shoulders. I can't live with this.' Killed: Rick and Gail Brink were shot dead in their home in November 1987, 18 months after they married . Victims: Wyngarden allegedly shot the couple because he was worried she would reveal they had sex as teens . At a hearing last year, she recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders in November 1987, just three months after they first started dating. 'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, ""What's wrong?"" and he said, ""I shot and killed Rick and Gail"". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.' When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said. Mrs Wyngarden explained that this intimate relationship had been a sexual one. She said she married him regardless of . his confession because she craved love and support for her and her two . children, one of whom was his. Revelations: Pam Wyngarden, pictured in court last year after the case was re-opened, told investigators that her husband had admitted to killing the couple and she agreed to help him cover it up . Denial: Wyngarden sobbed throughout the hearing in February 2013 and yelled that he was not guilty . In the years after Wyngarden allegedly . told his wife about the murder, he demanded she kept it a secret and . would not allow her to have any friends in fear that she would tell . them, she said. As she spoke in court last year, her husband sobbed and shouted: 'How can you say these things? I didn't kill them, I didn't!' But Crystal Beelen, a former girlfriend of . Wyngarden's, also testified that Wyngarden admitted that . he had had a sexual relationship with his sister when they were . teenagers. The bodies of Rick, 28, and Gail Brink, 22, were found by Rick's parents, Isla and Bud Brink, after he failed to show up for work. The couple had last been seen two days before at a wedding. In the hearing last year, Mrs Brink said she found her daughter-in-law on the bed with a pillow over her head and multiple gun wounds. Her son was also found shot dead in his truck outside the home. Happier times: Pam Wyngarden, pictured, said her husband, right, became controlling because he worried she would share his secret. Last year, she said she said she could no longer hide the truth . The couple had been married less than 18 months at the time of their deaths. The case fell cold as investigators found . no apparent motives and believed that the Brinks could have been . victims of mistaken identity. Ottawa County Sheriff's Capt. Mark Bennett told Michigan Live . that several civilians, retired officers and sheriff's detectives are . expected to return to the town to testify about the on-scene . investigation. The trial is expected to take at least two weeks. If convicted, Wyngarden would face a sentence of life in prison.","Ryan Wyngarden 'shot dead Rick and Gail Brink in 1987 because he was jealous of their relationship and worried she would reveal they had sex'

Ed Balls' flagship Labour plan to ‘guarantee’ jobs for every young person unemployed for a year is ‘pie in the sky’, Iain Duncan Smith said last night. The Work and Pensions Secretary said the scheme would not work, simply creating short-term placements in the public sector at vast cost to taxpayers. Under the plan, 18 to 24-year-olds out of work for a year will be offered a taxpayer-funded job for six months, with those who refuse losing benefits. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, visiting a construction in London yesterday, plans to raise taxes to pay for the youth jobs plans . Iain Duncan Smith blasted Ed Miliband's plan to give unemployed 18-24-year-olds taxpayer-funded jobs . Labour faced searching questions over the funding of the scheme, which it said would cost £5.5billion and be met with another tax raid on the pension pots of the better-off and a new tax on bankers’ bonuses. Ed Miliband said the scheme was ‘fully costed’ and ‘right and fair’. People on the 45p top rate of tax would get only 20 per cent tax relief on pension contributions, instead of the 45 per cent they receive now. Labour would also repeat its one-off 2009 tax on bank bonuses. But critics pointed out the party has previously earmarked a bankers’ bonus tax to reverse the Coalition’s increase in VAT, tax credit changes and child benefit cuts. The Tories said the party had suggested using new bank taxes to fund at least ten commitments. The Tories said official costings suggest the policy would cost £1.7billion more than Labour claims. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘They’re . re-spending the bankers’ bonus tax yet again – and raiding hard earned . pensioners’ savings. The last Labour government did huge damage to . savings and now they’re proposing to do it again.’ Repetition? Iain Duncan Smith said Miliband's scheme echoes a failed one done by the previous Labour government . He said Labour’s suggestion that 80 per cent of the placements would be in the private sector was ‘pie in the sky’, pointing out not one employer has signed up although the party trailed the scheme a year ago. He added: ‘Fundamentally, this type of scheme just doesn’t work. ‘Labour’s Future Jobs Fund, which this scheme looks very similar to, created short-term placements predominantly in the public sector. Each placement cost £6,500, and half of participants were back on benefits as soon as their time on the scheme was up. ‘Now they are proposing another expensive scheme which will just involve more borrowing and more taxes to pay for.’ 'The last Labour government did huge damage to savings... and now they're proposing to do it again' - Iain Duncan Smith, Work & Pension's Secretary . Mr Duncan Smith said the Government’s work experience scheme was available to the young unemployed from day one, rather than after a year of unemployment. It was costing around £325 per place, 20 times cheaper than Labour’s Future Jobs Fund, and had been shown to be effective at getting people off benefits and into work. Mr Miliband insisted: ‘We’ve got 56,000 young people who have been unemployed for over 12 months, a Labour government will tax the bankers’ bonuses and put our young people back to work.’ But James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Persistently high youth unemployment is a blight on our economy, but Labour’s job scheme does not bear much scrutiny as a solution. No government can pull a lever in Whitehall and expect youth unemployment to disappear. ‘Whilst a short-term placement may help some young people gain experience, it ignores the fundamental reasons for long-term unemployment, such as a welfare system which gives young people little incentive to get off benefits, and an education system that has failed to give them the skills and attitude they need to get a job.’ Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned the Government had already done ‘a lot’ to restrict pension tax relief available to higher earners and Labour’s proposal to launch a further raid was ‘extraordinarily complex’.","Miliband vows to hand taxpayer-funded job to unemployed 18-24-year-olds .

Randy Murray gave his daughter Faith and son Michael sandwiches to eat in the car en route to the Centre D'Enfant Aux 4 Vents in Barrhaven, Canada, on Monday morning. But instead of eating the sandwich, Faith decided to save hers for later and put it in her pocket. Suspended: Two-year-old Faith Murray was suspended after bringing a cheese sandwich to her daycare centre . When a staff member discovered the sandwich, her father was called and she was suspended immediately for three days. Mr Murray said he only gave them the sandwiches to eat on the way to school because they were running late that morning and had missed breakfast. 'This wasn’t a packed lunch or intentionally brought in. This was purely accidental by a two-year-old,' he said. The daycare has a strict ban on outside food being brought into the school to protect children with allergies. Centre D'Enfant Aux 4 Vents assistant director Nancy Brisebois told Metro she could not discuss the specific incident, but that the French-language centre clearly communicates their policy, which also includes automatic expulsion for possession of peanut butter, to parents. 'Upon enrolment, parents must sign a contract which they review and we review with them, and this contract specifically mentions that we have zero tolerance,' she said. Shocked: Faith Murray's father Randy said it was an honest mistake by a two-year-old, who shouldn't have been suspended for such a trivial incident. The daycare bans all outside food to protect children with allergies . Mr Murray, who doesn’t speak French, said he believed a warning would have been more reasonable under the circumstances. 'The automatic suspension kinda got right under my skin,” he said. 'We’ve decided that I’m going to take off [work] and be Daddy Daycare for the time being until we can line somebody else up. I feel too strongly about how this all kind of played out.' It follows a similar incident in Colnbrook, near Slough, where a six-year-old boy was expelled for bringing a bag of Mini Cheddars to school in his lunchbox last month. Riley Pearson was initially suspended for three days for 'continually breaking school rules', but was later expelled by the school when his parents told their story to the media.

A disgraced teacher who had sex with a 16-year-old pupil could be jailed for planning a holiday with him to Rome. Roseanna Langley, 24, was taken into custody and had her passport seized for breaching her court order by not giving police enough notice of her travel plans. Langley lost her dream career because of relationship with the boy, now 17. She was given a suspended prison sentence and signed the sex offenders' register last year. A court heard how she groomed the boy, who cannot be named, for sex, sent him naked pictures and lied about being pregnant and miscarrying his child to prolong the affair. Langley admitted two count of sexual activity with a male aged 13-17 while in a position of trust. She was given an eight-month sentence, suspended for two years, and was told to attend a sex offenders’ course. The former science teacher was led in handcuffs to Exeter Magistrates' Court today after spending a night in the cells. The court was told how she had already broken a rule in her court order which required her to notify them of foreign travel a week before leaving. Langley and the boy, with whom she is still having a relationship, went to Norway in January but only told officers afterwards. Yesterday, weeks after being cautioned, she went to her local police station to tell them about the Rome trip, due to begin on Sunday. Explicit messages: In July a jury was told how she sent hundreds of explicit texts to the boy, as well as naked pictures . Police arrested her and seized her passport and she spent the night in the cells. Yesterday she admitted breaching her notification requirements. The court was told about her affair with the youth which has continued. Miss Vanessa Francis, defending, said their relationship has continued and Langley was not his teacher before she was sacked and the lad left the school and is no longer a pupil. Breach: Langley admitted breaching the conditions of her court order after not giving officers proper warning of her foreign holidays . She said their relationship is known . to the probation service and they were heading off to Rome for a few . days before he joins the Army in Yorkshire at the end of next week. She has quit her job in a fast food outlet and is returning to her father’s home in Cornwall. Miss Francis said: 'She has not been trying to hide what she has been doing from the police. Her ultimate goal was to be a teacher. But what she did was wrong.' Appearance: Roseanne Langley, seen at Exeter Crown Court last year . Prosecutor Deborah Hodges said Langley claimed to have ‘forgotten’ about telling the police when she was going abroad - even though she had cautioned just a few weeks earlier following the Norwegian holiday. Exeter magistrates sent the case to the city’s Crown Court for a judge to sentence her next month. She was bailed. Her boyfriend, who cannot be identified for legal reasons because of his age, sat in the public gallery and waved to her as she was led up from the cells in tears. When she last appeared in that court last July a judge heard that Langley sent text messages to the teenager which included: 'Baby please let me tie you up tomorrow, it’s so sexy’ and ‘babe I love planning our future together’. Pupils at the Exeter secondary school became aware of their relationship after she invited students to her flat to watch films. They said the couple kissed and cuddled before going to her bedroom. Recorder Paul Dunkels QC said: 'I am told you had wanted to be a teacher since you were a child. You have destroyed that. You will never teach children again.'","Roseanna Langley, 24, had sex with the boy, now 17, while a teacher .

Four giant forests of up to 200,000 trees are to be planted to mark the centenary of the First World War, it has emerged. The sites - in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - will be planted as part of a £12million project to provide a memorial to the Great War, the Woodland Trust said as it unveiled the plans. More than three million free trees will . also be provided for schools, communities and youth groups to help . create hundreds of woods that will stand as a legacy to those who died, . fought or lost loved ones between 1914 and 1918. Memorial: Four flagship woodlands - one each in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - will be planted as part of a £12million project to honour the fallen from the Great War (pictured is the site of the Surrey wood) Big project: The 640-acre forest of 200,000 trees in Surrey that will be planted on the land pictured will cover an area bigger than the Olympic Park . In memory: Members of the public will be able to dedicate trees to ancestors at each of the woods (Surrey site pictured) The proposed English Centenary Wood at Langley Vale in Surrey - currently in private ownership - will be even bigger than the 560-acre Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and will link up pockets of existing woodland. It will be next to Epsom Racecourse and have around 200,000 trees. Members of the public will be able to dedicate trees to ancestors at each of the woods. A thousand acres of woodland will be created by the four flagship sites. The Trust said it hoped land owners and communities across the country would also get involved in creating hundreds of other woods, containing millions of trees. Woodland Trust project director Karl Mitchell said: ‘The trees planted during the course of this £12 million project will stand for hundreds of years, providing a lasting tribute to all those involved in the First World War. ‘We hope to see many thousands of people getting involved by planting their own tribute or dedicating trees in memory of loved ones.’ He added: ‘At a time when our woodland cover is so low compared to other countries, planting trees now is more important than ever. The site of the proposed Surrey forest is marked out in red, with Epsom race course at the top of the map . Big project: The Epsom forest will be larger than the Olympic Park (pictured) ‘As well as representing enormous strength and bravery shown by the nation during the First World War, the trees that are planted during the course of the project will help strengthen our natural landscape, increasing its resilience to the threats posed by pests and diseases.’ The Woodland Trust will deliver the Centenary Woods project in partnership with Sainsbury's, whose chief executive, Justin King, said planting trees and creating woodlands was a fitting tribute to the sacrifices made during the First World War. ‘I especially think of my late great grandfather, Charles Robert Avery, who was a Bombardier in the First World War and it is pleasing to know that I can ensure his contribution will be permanently remembered, along with many others,’ he said.

'Worried': CBI president Sir Mike Rake criticised politicians who offer 'headline-grabbing policies which sometimes appear aimed at securing votes' A leading businessman last night launched a thinly-veiled attack on Ed Miliband, warning that an anti-business government would damage the economy and cost jobs. Sir Mike Rake, president of the CBI and chairman of BT, said the economic recovery is ‘increasingly being exposed to political risk’. Although he did not identify the Labour leader by name, he criticised politicians who offer ‘headline-grabbing policies which sometimes appear aimed more at securing votes than encouraging investment and job creation’. He said: ‘Business is increasingly worried about policy interventions such as on energy, banking, tax and land ownership.’ The comments, in a speech at the Lord Mayor’s Trade and Industry Dinner at Mansion House in London, were seen as a clear attack on Mr Miliband’s increasingly Left-wing agenda. The Labour leader has pledged to freeze household energy bills for 20 months if he becomes Prime Minister in a move that could cost jobs and investment and lead to blackouts. Mr Miliband has also threatened to split up the banks, reinstate the 50p top rate of tax, raise corporation tax for some of Britain’s biggest employers, and confiscate land off private developers. The range of policies has sparked panic in boardrooms across the country amid fears that a Labour victory in 2015 would herald the arrival of the most Left-wing and anti-business government since the 1970s. Sir Mike said it was crucial that private enterprise is encouraged to prosper, create jobs and drive growth in the economy. ‘The business community is a force for good, has created and is creating jobs,’ he said. ‘It’s the only way we can ensure this recovery benefits all.’ Sir Mike praised the current government for ‘sticking to its guns on tackling the deficit’ which hit a record £157.3billion under Labour. He added: ‘The government has done well in progressing a positive business tax environment and as a result we are much more competitive globally.’ But Sir Mike bemoaned the government’s failure on infrastructure - including the lack of action to increase airport capacity in the south-east of England. ‘We cannot afford further delays,’ he said. The CBI now expects the economy to . grow by 2.6 per cent this year following expansion of 1.8 per cent in . 2013 - the best performance since 2007. Sir Mike said: ‘The UK is doing better. The pace of our economic recovery has surprised us and our near neighbours.’ He urged George Osborne to ‘priorities measures to boost business investment and trade’ in the Budget this month. ‘For . business investment to flourish we need a pro-enterprise, pro-business . agenda to allow productivity to increase so that growth will mean an . actual increase in levels of prosperity for all,’ he said. Vows: Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze household energy bills for 20 months, threatened to split up the banks, reinstate the 50p top rate of tax, raise corporation tax, and confiscate land off private developers . The CBI, which represents 240,000 companies across the UK, also flagged Scottish independence as a major risk to the economy. Sir Mike said: ‘Clearly, the decision about whether or not Scotland becomes independent is a matter for the Scottish voter. But many will want to know, and are indeed now asking, what the effect of independence will be on Scotland’s economy and business environment. ‘It is the CBI’s considered view that the economic effects of independence would be deeply destabilising and create significant uncertainty which is bound to affect investment and jobs. ‘This is why we believe that Scotland and the United Kingdom stand stronger together - and weaker apart - in today’s interconnected and global world.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government’s long term economic plan is working. But the recovery is not yet secure and the biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that’s providing economic security for hardworking people.’","Sir Mike Rake says economic recovery 'increasingly exposed to political risk'

A three-year-old-girl was run over and killed when a freak gust of wind blew her buggy into the path of a reversing van, an inquest heard. Olivia Langley died from severe head injuries after being hit by a delivery van just as her mother was about to take her to to nursery school. Louise Uffindell dashed inside her home in Croydon, south London, to check her gas meter, leaving Olivia in her pushchair just outside the door. Killed: Olivia Langley was on her way to nursery school when she was run over by a delivery van . Dashed inside: Olivia's mother, Louise Uffindell, left, submitted a statement to Croydon Coroner's Court describing the accident . Distraught: Louise Uffindell was too upset to attend the inquest at Croydon Coroner's Court . But then she heard an ‘unusual’ noise and ran out to discover the girl lying in the road. She scooped her up and screamed ‘My child, my child!’ in grief before she desperately tried to give her daughter mouth-to-mouth after the collision on 25 March last year. Ms Uffindell, 34, was too distraught at her daughter’s death to attend the inquest at Croydon Coroner’s Court, which ruled that her daughter's death was an accident. However, she submitted a statement, which began by telling how she was running late that morning. She decided to put Olivia in a pushchair . because it would be quicker and added: ‘We got outside and I remembered . I needed to check the gas meter to see how much credit I had. Scene: The driver of the delivery van described how he felt only a 'touch' when he came into contact with the pushchair . ‘I put the pushchair on the pavement and left it outside while I quickly went back in and checked, and left Olivia sitting in the pushchair on the pavement immediately outside. ‘I did not put the brake on. I was only inside the flat for a few moments when I heard an unusual noise. I can’t explain the noise, I didn’t know what it was, but it got my attention and made me run outside. ‘When I got outside I found Olivia and her pushchair. They were both lying on their left side fully in the road. Distraught: Olivia's father, Stewart Langley, pictured laying a tribute after her death, appeared in court today but was too upset to speak . ‘Olivia was positioned as if she was still in it. The van was directly in front of them. ‘My immediate reaction was just to get Olivia out of the road and pick her up. ‘I was running up and down the street and telling the people in the van to call an ambulance.’ Ms Uffindell said she initially thought delivery driver Clinton Jackson and his passenger Tracy Phillips must have been speeding to hit her child. She said: ‘I said “Why were you speeding,” the woman said “we weren’t.” ‘I assumed they must have been because they had hit Olivia but I did not see the van before the collision or the collision itself.’ The court heard the weather was ‘exceptionally windy’ and the road was in poor condition with potholes in the street. Looking very emotional as he recounted the tragedy, Mr Jackson said: ‘I started to reverse, it must have been only a second or two into the reverse when I felt what I said was a touch. It didn’t feel like a hit or a bump, it was a touch. ‘I felt that, knowing that the floor had potholes and rubble and things, before I carried on any further I stopped.’ Mr Jackson, who was marking his birthday on the day, added: ‘I felt the touch and she just stepped out of the door. ‘I saw her running saying “My child, my child”. I was thinking, what child? Until she picked her up, and that’s when I thought - her child. That’s when I first caught sight of her.’ Ms Phillips, who broke down in tears as she listened to the evidence, told the inquest: ‘I saw Olivia in her pushchair outside her front door as he did a full lock to reverse. ‘He was looking behind and then the next minute Olivia’s mother came out screaming. We looked at each other in shock and then she picked the little girl up from the floor.’ Mark Crouch, a car crash . investigator, told the court: ‘It was extremely windy and the . arrangement of the buildings created somewhat of a wind tunnel. ‘Throughout the investigation there were a number of times when the wind picked up and pushed the buggy along the road. Sympathies: Mr Langley's gift joined others outside Olivia's home in Croydon . Olivia, pictured with mother Louise Uffindell, died when her buggy was apparently blown in front of a van . In loving memory: A floral tribute left by Mr Langley in the wake of the accident . Although one of the van’s mirrors was partly smashed, this wouldn’t have contributed to the accident because the pushchair was ‘completely’ in the driver’s ‘blind spot.’ He said the most likely scenario was that the buggy moved from the pavement into the road and ‘fell face down.’ Coroner Dr Roy Palmer recorded a verdict of accidental death. Addressing Olivia’s father Stewart Langley, a former boxer, who sat in the front row, the coroner said: ‘Obviously I’m so very sorry you lost Olivia in such sad circumstances. ‘Its a great shame that the brake wasn’t on the buggy, but whether that would have made any difference we don’t know. It was very windy. ‘I’m so sorry you lost your daughter in that way. My sympathies to all of her family, including her mother who I know is to upset to come today.’ Mr Langley was too upset to speak as he left court.","Olivia Langley was on her way to nursery when accident happened .

British Transport Police have launched an appeal after the man persuaded staff at the Bounds Green transport terminal in North London that he was a fellow worker. The man, wearing a hard hat and bright yellow safety jacket, said he needed to borrow five huge metal road plates, weighing three quarters of a tonne each. The £600 hardened metal plates, used as a heavy duty covering during temporary road and rail repairs, were loaded into the back of a white flatbed truck with a forklift at the railway depot. Detective Constable Nick Thompson said: ‘The man entered the depot office in Bounds Green and spoke to staff, claiming to work at a neighbouring depot. ‘He asked to borrow a number of metal road plates, hardened steel plates designed to protect troughing routes where cables are laid. ‘The staff member eventually agreed to lend some plates to the man, who was wearing a high-visibility jacket. ‘The man then entered the neighbouring depot and asked for their assistance loading the plates onto a van with the use of their forklift truck.

Lisa Clothier, 48, and her husband, 45-year-old Harold Clothier, from Argyle County, New York went on the run for more than a year after they were initially charged with the crimes. But when police learned that the couple, who have been wanted on arrest warrants since 2011, had returned to New York from Florida, authorities arrested them on Tuesday. The charges stem from 2011, when . friends told Lisa Clothier that they could not afford to get their dog . and kitten neutered, the Glens Falls Post-Star reported. Arrest: Lisa and Harold Clothier have been arrested after more than a year on the run. They were charged in 2011 with illegally neutering animals, which left a kitten and a dog in need of emergency veterinarian care . She told the friends that she was a veterinary technician and could carry out the operations - when she in fact worked at a Wal-Mart in Queensbury, police said. The dog needed extensive care after it chewed a hole in its abdomen to deal with the pain coming from its wound following the botched procedure, officials said. The cat, who was owned by one of Clothier's co-workers, suffered injuries when she allegedly performed the procedure on the wrong part of the cat's genitals. The owner took her pet to Northway Emergency Veterinary Clinic with the severe injury - sparking an investigation and leading to the arrest of Clothier. Authorities said there was no indication she was paid or that she was a licensed veterinary technician, the Post-Star reported. Accused: Lisa Clothier told her friends she had a license to carry out the procedures even though she did not, and her husband held the animals down during the procedures .

A former member of President Obama's Cabinet has revealed that he now expects to make $4million in his role as an executive at CitiGroup. Peter Orzag left his post as the Office of Management and Budget director in July 2010 and got a major salary boost when he joined the bank in 2011. Now his ex-wife is fighting for a renegotiated child support package and the court documents showed how dramatically his pay has increased since joining the private sector. Current wife: Peter Orszag, seen here with then-fiancee Bianna Golodryga at a White House State dinner in May 2010, is fighting with his first wife (not pictured) over child support payments for his two oldest children . Last year, he reportedly made $3.1milllion but he apparently expects to make $4million this year. Mr Orzag was married to Cameron Kennedy, whose maiden name Hamill but has since adopted her mother's name, until 2006 and the couple had two children together. At the time, they agreed that he would fund a $400,000 trust that would cover school tuition for their children and other unidentified major expenses. It is not clear if they had a separate alimony agreement but Ms Hamill has not been reliant on him for money as The Washington Post reports that she is a consultant for McKinsey and makes $350,000 on her own. The children's fund has been depleted over the past eight years between tuition at Georgetown Day School which ranges from $32,100 for pre-kindergarten to $36,890 for seniors in high school. Renegotiating: Cameron Rachel Hamill (left), who now goes by her mother's maiden name of Kennedy, was married to Orszag from 1997 to 2006 and they have two children together. She is fighting for more child support . Together: Orszag's children from his first marriage- Josh (left) and Leila (right)- live and go to school in DC while he and Golodryga and their son Jake (center) live in New York while he works for Citigroup and she for ABC . Tuition: Orszag has offered to pay Georgetown Day School tuition- which ranges from $32,100 for pre-kindergarten to $36,890 for seniors in high school- for this two children from his first marriage but his ex wants a monthly stipend . Orszag, who was President Obama's youngest Cabinet member and is now 45, has offered to replenish the fund and pay the tuition bills directly so that they would not drain the fund. Ms Kennedy has a different plan, however, and wants him to pay $22,000-per-month. That plan would amount to him paying $264,000-per-year as opposed to one lump fee for the trust. Split: Questions linger about when exactly Orszag and Claire Milonas (pictured in 2005) broke up, and whether or not he knew she was pregnant with their daughter Tatiana at the time . His lawyers have nixed her proposal, slamming it as 'backdoor alimony cloaked as child support'. Orszag . fought the court to try to have the . financial battle sealed but the D.C. court ruled that it would be ‘both . inappropriate and untenable’ to keep Orszag’s earnings private. The salary increase will also mark a blow for Democrats as Orszag was one in a string of Obama administration heads who left for more lucrative jobs on Wall Street. This has been the biggest child support battle yet for the economist but it is not the first time that his personal life has played out on a public stage. After he and Ms Kennedy split in 2006, he was momentarily one of Washington's most eligible bachelors. The 6 foot 2 inch Massachusetts native had something of a cult following with fans who launched a website called Orszagasm.com. His . public profile became more about his personal life than public policy . in 2010 when he got engaged to ABC Weekend anchor Bianna Colodryga weeks . after his ex-girlfriend gave birth to his child. Orszag . split from his shipping magnate heiress girlfriend Claire Milonas in . the spring of 2009 when she was three months pregnant. In . November of that year, Ms Milonas gave birth to their daughter Tatiana . Zoe, and less than six weeks later, Ms Golodryga announced on air that . she was engaged to Orszag. According to The New York Times, friends of Ms Milonas began talking to the press, alleging that he had promised to marry her after she became pregnant but then left her after meeting Ms Golodryga. In the joint statement that Orszag and . Milonas issued in January to deal with the gathering storm, they allude . to the fact that they split months before the birth but never said . exactly when. Official: Golodryga, pictured with Orszag at the White House Correspondents Dinner in May 2010, announced their engagement on air and showed her ring which friends of Milonas took as an insult . Newest addition: Orszag and Golodryga live in New York (pictured during a visit to the Intrepid) with their son Jake though he also has a residence in D.C. 'We were in a . committed relationship until the spring of 2009. In November, Claire . gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Although we are no longer together, . we are both thrilled she is happy and healthy,' the statement read. Some reports allege that Orszag and Ms Golodryga first met at the White House Correspondents Dinner which was held in May 2009. His lovelife was clearly a poorly kept secret at the time, as President Obama even made a joke at his expense the following year, saying that a new reality show would be launched called 'Jon & Kate Plus Peter Orszag'. Orszag and Ms Goloryga have since added to his brood when their son Jake Spencer Orszag was born in April 2012.","Peter Orszag has revealed that he expects to make $4million this year .

While Jones cried on the witness stand Wednesday and said he was no longer affiliated with a prison white supremacist gang, prosecutors argue that he shot Lomax out of racism. 'You’re trying to make this a racial thing,' Jones shot back at one point, using his wife's black father and a friend in the court room as evidence he isn't prejudiced. Sister Karrina Slabbekorn and friend Vanessa Reyes-Singh spent the night before the shooting out clubbing and had a run-in with Lomax at a Wendy's in the early hours of December 8. Lomax thought he saw Reyes-Singh point a gun at him, so he called 911 while he tailed the girls into a Sacramento neighborhood. Lomax, who was only in town to attend his son's birthday party, was about to leave the unfamiliar neighborhood when a car swerved in front of him, blocking his way. While he was talking to a 911 operator, Slabbekorn had called her brother who lived with another sister in nearby. Jones says his sister sounded 'hysterical' and 'panicked' by the 'n*****' following them, so he grabbed his revolver and drove off to confront Lomax. Stalked: Jones shot Lomax after getting a call from his sister who said a 'n*****' was following her a friend in their car . On the line: Lomax was on the phone with 911 operators the whole time, tailing the two girls because he thought they brandished a weapon at him. Jones shot at hist six times . Jones first passed his sister's friend on the road, and let her drive past. But then he quickly turned and blocked Lomax and got out of the car. Just before his line with the 911 operator went dead, Lomax said: 'Oh, now we got somebody else.I guess they called somebody else, to – oh, hey, how – ho, ho, ho. This guy has a gun and he’s shooting at me.' It's still unclear what actually occurred in those moments after the call dropped. Jones says he got out of the car and feared Lomax was going to run over him so he fired a single shot. 'At that time, I was fearing for my life and my sister's you know,' Jones told KCRA from jail in December 2012. 'So, when I jumped back, I opened fire on the vehicle.' From there, he ran to the side of the vehicle but tripped and says Jones began to back up again. Again, Jones claims he feared he was going to be run over so he fired five more shots into the side of the car. One of he bullets hit Lomax's neck, killing the man who ran an x-ray cleaning business with his family in Atlanta. Jones called the shooting 'an accident' and 'a mistake' to KCRA. Not planned: When interviewed by KCRA reporters in December 2012, Jones said the shooting was a 'mistake' and an 'accident' After Lomax's line went dead, the 911 operator dispatched police to the area but by the time they arrived it was too late. In court on Wednesday, prosecutors say Jones was motivated to kill Lomax because the man was black, pointing to the 'White Power', 'Pure Hate' and swastika tattoos he has on his body. But Jones says he was just 15 and 16 when he got the permanent marks, and they no longer reflect how he actually feels. 'I made some bad decisions as a kid, and I’ve regretted it ever since,' he said. In court, he wore a green dress shirt buttoned all the way to the top to conceal one of his offensive neck tattoos . If convicted, this will be the third time Lomax has entered state prison. His most recent conviction was in 2011 for being an ex-felon with a firearm. He's facing those charges again now since he was illegally possessing a pistol when he shot Lomax. When asked by a KCRA reporter in December 2012 how he got the weapon, Jones said: 'that don't matter'. Reporters also showed up to Jones' mother after his initial arrest. While she wouldn't talk much about her 25-year-old son, she did vouch for him. 'He's not the kind of person they say he is,' she said. When confronted by reporters, all Jones' mother said was 'He's not the kind of person they say he is'","Brian Keith Jones, 25, killed 36-year-old Duane Lomax in December 2012 after Lomax had a run-in with his sister .

The Washington driver accused of recklessly causing the tragic deaths of 17-year-old twin sisters in October is now asking a judge for his license back. Ira Blackstock, 53, is accused of two counts of vehicular homicide in the deaths of Jeneah and Janesah Goheen but says he simply must have his license back in order to run his roofing business. To the still grieving community of Oak Harbor, the request is further infuriating proof that Blackstock can't own up to what he's done. Fit to drive? Ira Blackstock, right, and his attorney (pictured late last year) are asking a Washington court to give the 53-year-old accused of vehicular homicide in the deaths of twin 17-year-old girls his license back . Killed: Janesah Goheen, left, died from her injuries 11 days after her twin sister Janeah, right, died in a car crash. The girls were with another friend when their car was struck by Blackstock . 'My concern is that he hasn't accepted . responsibility for what happened,' family friend Dena Royal told KREM. 'Accidents happen, but he's still responsible, and until you take . responsibility, I don't think you need to be behind the wheel.' Royal's sentiments have echoed through the small town since the loss of the girls. And that includes their father Jim Goheen. 'He . just has to live with what he's done,' a weeping Goheen told KIRO not long . after Blackstock's attorney suggested in court late last year that . mechanical issues in his mustang may have been to blame. Janesah Goheen, 17, passed away 11 days after her identical . twin, Janeah, was killed in the crash in Oak Hill, Washington as the . girls drove with a friend to visit a haunted house. Horror crash: The three teenaged girls had to be cut out of the wreck of the 1993 Acura they were traveling in . Not at fault? Blackstock was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. But the grief-stricken Washington community was appalled when his attorneys suggested his car may be to blame . 'He just has to live with what he's done,'urged the girls grieving father . In . a heartbreaking twist, it is the third tragedy for the family, who lost . another daughter - 23-year-old Jessica Goheen Thorn - in May 2008 to a . car wreck. Janesah had been . driving their 1993 Acura at 5pm on Halloween when it was hit head-on by . a Ford Mustang driven by 53-year-old Ira Blackstock and was rushed to hospital in serious condition. Her progress had given her family hope, KIRO-TV, reported, but she succumbed to her injuries surrounded by family and friends. The twins' pastor, Russell Schlecht, told the station there was some comfort in the death. 'This is the longest they've been apart,' he said. 'One being taken . instantly, one enduring as long as she could. 'As awful as it is, I'm glad they're together right now. There's a beauty to it. A sense there this needed to happen.' Family tragedy: Their deaths come five years after their big sister Jessica, pictured, was killed in a car crash . Troopers said Blackstock had crossed the centerline on Highway 20 in his Mustang and . slammed into their car. Police say Blackstock appeared to have been accelerating at the time of impact. The damage was so severe that the girls had to be cut from their vehicle. Janeah, who was seated in the back of car, was killed in the . accident while the twins' close friend Alysha Pickler, 18, was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered a concussion. When authorities arrived on the scene, Blackstock allegedly showed signs of impairment and a blood sample was taken to test his blood alcohol level. He's since been cleared of any charges he may have been under the influence of drugs, but faces a vehicular homicide charge for each girl and an additional vehicular assault charge. Impaired: Toxicology are pending but officers say Blackstock appeared impaired and found this flier in the back of his car . An Alcoholics Anonymous brochure and a Bible were found in . the backseat of his car. Blackstock suffered minor injuries and was arrested after his release from hospital. According to KING 5, the twins sang in perfect harmony at their local church and often finished each other's sentences. Oak Harbor School District communications officer Kellie Tormey told the Skagit Valley Herald: 'It's a shocking tragedy for us.' Injured: Janesah is pictured with her friend Alysha Pickler, who suffered a concussion in the crash . A life together: Twins Janesah and Janeah Goheen were close, often finishing each others sentences . Tormey said the Goheen twins had attended Oak Harbor High School and HomeConnections, the home-school program.

Going home: A federal judge let 34-year-old Julia Bagdanov go free on bail after she was charged with her parents in a shoplifting spree . A federal judge allowed Julia Bogdanov do go free on bail today after the 34-year-old woman was busted in a shoplifting ring with her parents. Bogdanov will be allowed to live at her family's $1.4million home with her sister during the trial, while her parents will remain behind bars without bond. Julia was arrested along with her parents Branko, 58, and Lela Bogdanov, 52, earlier this month after federal authorities discovered they stole $7million in merchandise over the past 10 years. In their decade-long spree, the related trio stole dolls, toys, cosmetics and other valuables and sold them online for more than a total of more than $4million. Lela Bogdanov frequently donned a long black skirt with large compartments sewn on the inside during the alleged shoplifting binges and was caught on surveillance cameras leaving some stores with her skirt looking notably fuller than when she entered, the criminal complaint says. Federal prosecutors successfully argued that Branko and Lela Bogdanov were flight risks, since both are in the United States illegally. The couple emigrated from the former-Yugoslavia. 'This defendant has nothing to lose,' prosecutor Renato Mariotti said of Branko Bogdanov at Monday's hearing. 'I think if you let him go ... he'll disappear.' The couple have been accused of lying to authorities since getting arrested earlier this month. Prosecutors say Branko has been concealing his wealth by saying he's $28,500 in debt and owes $1.3million on his house and 12 vehicles - which include a Lexus and Corvette. Lela, on the other hand, has been accused of pretending to be sick. Locked in: Both Lela (left) and Branko Bogdanov were ordered to remain behind bars without bail after prosecutors successfully argued they were flight risks . Lying: Prosecutors say Branko Bogdanov has been concealing his wealth . Mariotti pointed out the fact that  Lela's slow shuffle in court doesn't match up to her behavior on surveillance video which shows her sprinting out of stores with toys and other items concealed in her skirt. Serial stealer: Branko Bogdanov has a rich criminal history including a prior conviction for theft in Georgia . Her attorney argued that his client wasn't faking her illness and that she has cancer. Lela, who has to speak through a Romani-translator, is 'functionally illiterate' and is dependent on her five U.S.-born children her attorney said. She also doesn't have a driver's license. 'She has no way to take herself to (the former) Yugoslavia,' her attorney said. The United States Secret Service brought down the Bogdanovs after Barnes and Noble Inc. and Toys R Us Inc. contacted the agency about what the complaint describes as 'a huge loss in merchandise'. With the help of those companies and eBay, authorities traced stolen items to an online trading account of the cooperating witnesses, who, in turn, agreed to help in the investigation of the Bogdanovs. A conviction on the one count of interstate transportation of stolen property carries sentence of up to 10 years. And this isn't the first time a member of the Bogdanov family is facing jail time for stealing. According to public records, father Branko has a previous theft conviction from Georgia in 1989, and was convicted of burglary in Texas in 1977. Mother Lela was a criminal history in Pennsylvania, and plead guilty to charges of engaging in a criminal conspiracy, receiving stolen property and retail theft in December 200. Same goes for their daughter Lela who has several arrests herself, including for theft in Florida in July of 1997. Public records state that the family's median household income is $108,333. Ill-gotten gains? The family's $1.4 million Chicago home was allegedly funded by their epic crime spree .","Julia Bogdanov, 34, was allowed to go free on bail today while her parents were kept behind bars after being accessed as flight risks .

His wife, it appears, is equally perturbed. Sproles' wife, Michel, took to Instagram to lash out against the Saints' front office for the unprofessional manner in which they have treated her husband. Peeved: both Darren Sproles and his wife, Michel, are upset with how the New Orleans Saints treated the running back in the off-season . Who Dat! Michel Sproles explained that her problem wasn't with Saints fans, but with the team's front office . Michel Sproles' rant - which has since been deleted from her account - is heavy on two things: profanity and God. 'I am so disappointed in the Saints organization & the way they are treating my husband,' she wrote. 'I understand this is a brutal business but when u [sic] have a  good guy who works hard & does a lot for the community u [sic] would think they would show a little more respect.

The post included several social media hasgtags, including '#YesICurseAndPraiseGod #OnlyGodCanJudgeMe #IputHisChargerPicsUpBecauseTheSaintsAint(Expletive)ForWhatTheyDoin.' Many Saints fans - members of 'WhoDat Nation' - weren't pleased with what they considered an attack on their city and their team, and fired off several angry responses to Michel Sproles' lengthy Istagram update. In a separate post, Michel Sproles attempted to clarify the point she was trying to make. 'I did not attack the Who Dat Nation, I specifically said I was . referring to the Front Office,' she wrote. 'I think the Who Dat Nation . is awesome!' Sproles, who signed a $14 million, four-year deal with the Saints in 2011, was traded Thursday to the Philadelphia Eagles after a bitter split with the Saints. After she'd cooled off a bit, Michel Sproles said a heartfelt goodbye to the fans her husband has acquired while a member of the Saints. 'I want to send a special thank you to the WhoDat Nation & Everyone that supported my husband through his journey as a Saint,' she wrote. 'We will miss the love in New Orleans & our New Orleans Fam!'

Americans now believe marijuana is so harmless that they ranked sugar as more harmful to a person's health in a recent poll. The survey questioned 1,000 adults on a wide variety of topics ranging from health to politics to religion. One of the questions asked which substance 'is more harmful to a person's overall health:' marijuana, sugar, tobacco or alcohol? Big bads: Americans see sugar as more harmful thank marijuana but not as bad as alcohol or tobacco . According to the results, tallied by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, 49 per cent ranked tobacco as most harmful followed by alcohol at 24 per cent, sugar at 15 per cent, marijuana at 8 per cent, all at 3 per cent, and not sure at 1 per cent. The full poll can be read here. The results are just the latest evidence of sugar's image problem, with the sweet carb being called the 'new tobacco' by doctors earlier this year. Food giants are being told to cut the amount of sugar they use because it has become the ‘new tobacco’. Doctors and academics say levels must be reduced by up to 30 per cent to halt a wave of disease and death. They found that even zero-fat yoghurts can contain five teaspoons of sugar, while a can of Heinz tomato soup has four. The equivalent of 11 teaspoons are found in a small Starbucks caramel Frappuccino with whipped cream. A Mars bar has eight. ‘Sugar is the new tobacco,’ said Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool. ‘Everywhere, sugary . drinks and junk foods are now pressed on unsuspecting parents and . children by a cynical  industry focused on profit not health. The obesity epidemic is generating a huge burden of disease and death. Stop that: Doctors believe sugar consumption must be slowed up to 30 per cent to stop obesity rates from climbing . However marijuana is not without health risks, as use can lead to early onset psychosis and the effects of use on the developing brain. But there have been no documented deaths from marijuana overdose and there are medicinal applications for pot. 'Anyone . who takes a truly objective look at the evidence surrounding these . substances could not possibly arrive at any other conclusion,' Mason . Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project, told .

Is your New Year's resolution to tone up and lose weight? Perhaps you're planning to join a gym so you can slog for miles on the treadmill or attend low intensity exercise classes like Zumba. Many people with good intentions do this every year but still struggle to shift stubborn fat. So if you really want to get slim in 2014 - and stay that way - author Julia Buckley recommends ditching endurance-based activities for short bursts of exercise and pumping iron. The personal trainer has tried and tested her methods with numerous clients and now her 12-week fitness programme is available for everyone to follow in the form of her book, The Fat Burn Revolution: Boost Your Metabolism And Burn Fat Fast, published by Bloomsbury on 2nd January. Julia's fat loss plan focuses on raising people's metabolic rate (the amount of calories your body burns) using high-intensity cardio, plyometrics and challenging resistance sessions - that all take a maximum of 45 minutes to complete. A former ultra-marathon runner herself, Julia recommends people forgo long runs and other endurance exercises like swimming if they want to lose weight. She writes: 'Running, cycling and swimming can be fantastic in small amounts but many people (including me) get carried away and keep upping their mileage without realising that their training is at odds with their health/fitness/fatloss goals.' She explains how endurance activities cause the body to store energy as fat so it has reserves to get through the miles ahead. But with her recommended high intensity exercises - which people can do in their own homes -  the body will instead store fuel as glycogen in the muscles. She explains: 'How will this get rid of fat on your body? Because of the ""after burn effect"". You're going to train so hard your metabolic rate will go through the roof and it will stay high even after you finish training while your body adapts and recovers. 'This will cause you to burn more fat for 24-48 hours after exercising.' No need to join a gym: Julia's methods are tried and tested and the exercises can be done in your own home . Julia recommends people follow her 12-week plan, which involves exercises such as burpees and press ups, alongside eating healthily for optimum weightloss results. She's loathe to call it a 'diet' and believes calorie counting is not the way forward. Hence there's no food plan or recipe suggestions in the Fat Burn Revolution. Instead she gives readers 'guidelines' that are 'incredibly effective for reducing body fat, improving energy levels and generally ensuring your body gets what it needs to thrive.' This means she recommends eliminating processed sugars (which are highly fattening), limiting diary products (because 'all the growth hormones and lactose it contains will inhibit your fatloss') and replacing carb-loaded pasta, breads and cereals with vegetables and protein-rich foods such as fish, eggs and lean cuts of meat. Shape up in 2014: This excerpt from the Fat Burn Revolution shows some of the exercises Julia recommends to burn fat and tone up . A key aspect of Julia's programme involves gaining muscle for a more toned and sculpted body. But she stresses that her weight-lifting exercises won't make women turn into bulky bodybuilders. She explains: 'Adding muscle not only gives your body a firmer, more attractive shape, it improves athletic performance, reduces injury risk, aids mobility and agility, reduces aches and pains, brings a huge range of health benefits and of course makes you strong.' She adds for the women who may have shunned using weights in the past: 'If you are concerned that gaining muscle will make you look too big and bulky, please put that out of your head. This is something that tends to worry women more than men, but ladies, I can assure you that getting big muscles is very hard for us to achieve even when we try to.' Success: Kat Ford has dropped nearly a stone and a half after introducing weights into her exercise regime . Banished her love handles: A view of Kat's back reveals her fat loss... ... while some the side, she's also a lot slimmer and now has a flat stomach . People who have already seen the results of following Julia's programme include Kat Ford, 26, from Merseyside, who wanted to get in shape for her wedding. She regularly exercised by running but was struggling to shift stubborn areas of fat. She had never done weight training before but was willing to try something new in order to fit into her dream wedding dress. She said: 'I had tried diets before, . and sometimes had lost weight, but it always crawled back on as soon as I . stopped dieting. The diets were never suitable for the long term. No . matter how much exercise I did I couldn’t seem to shift the weight, even . when I ran the Great North Run in 2011 and was running about 30 miles a . week in training, I still couldn’t get the weight to shift, which was . very frustrating as I felt physically very fit.' Kat said lifting weights and doing . short bursts of exercise - never taking up more than half an hour of her . day - has made all the difference and she has now lost nearly a stone . and a half, dropping from 12st 6lb to 11st 1lb in 12 weeks.

Graco Children's Products has added more than 403,000 child seats to last month's recall of 3.8 million to replace faulty harness buckles. But the added seats won't end a dispute with the U.S. government's road safety watchdog. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration still wants Graco to add 1.8 million infant seats to the recall because they have the same buckles. Buckles can get gummed up by food and drinks, making it difficult to remove children. In some cases parents have had to cut harnesses to get their children out. Write caption here . Safety first: The issue with Graco seats including the Nautilus 3-in-1 (left) and the Ready Ride (right) is the buckle . The agency says the problem increases the risk of injuries in emergencies. Graco said in a letter to the agency that it found additional toddler and harnessed booster seats that should be recalled. More... Four THOUSAND patients risk HIV after insulin pens were re-used, New York hospital warns . Too long in a buggy 'harms child's brain': Over-reliance on pushchairs can hamper speech and physical skills . Graco told federal investigators the stuck buckles didn't pose an unreasonable safety risk to users and that it knew of no injuries associated with the problem. However, the company is a named defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit filed in California, in which the plaintiff alleges that Graco's 'Nautilus' car seat was extremely difficult to unlatch after a car accident. Two-year-old Leiana Ramirez was killed in an ensuing car fire, reports AOL Autos. The 403,222 seats added to the recall include 2006 through 2014 Argos 70 Elite, Ready Ride, Step 2, My Ride 65 with Safety Surround, My Size 70, Head Wise 70 with Safety Surround, Nautilus 3-in-1, Nautilus Plus, and Smart Seat with Safety Surround, according to NHTSA documents. In its letter to NHTSA, Graco said it didn't include the infant seats because they are used differently than the toddler seats, and because in an emergency, an adult can remove the whole seat from the car rather than unlatch the buckle. Buckle-up: If child seats have square buttons, they're up to date, but if they're round, they need to be replaced . Battle: My Ride 65 (left) and Argos 70 Elite (right) are already recalled, but the NHTSA wants 1.8 million others to be added to the list . 'Graco looks forward to further discussions with the agency to resolve any remaining issues relating to those additional car seats,' the letter said. Atlanta-based Graco, a division of Newell Rubbermaid Inc., has until March 20 to explain why last month's recall didn't include infant seats. A NHTSA spokesman wouldn't comment and referred a reporter to the agency's previous statements about why seven rear-facing infant seat models should be recalled. The recall, now at 4.2 million, is the fourth-largest child seat recall in American history. If the infant seats are added, it would be the largest such recall.","Child seat manufacturer Graco has added more than 403,000 child seats to a recall order already at 3.8 million .

'You won't find any admiration from me': The world's richest man is not a big Edward Snowden fan, even if they've both set out to fix things in the world that they believe are broken . But that doesn't mean the man whose $76 billion worth dwarfs the GDP of many countries cares much for the U.S. government, either. The conversation, printed in the latest issue of Rolling Stone, reveals he takes issue with both sides of the debate. 'If he wanted to raise the issues and stay in the country and engage in civil disobedience or something of that kind, or if he had been careful in terms of what he had released,' said Gates, 'then it would fit more of the model of ""OK, I'm really trying to improve things.""' There has to be a debate. But the specific techniques they use become unavailable if they're discussed in detail. So the debate needs to be about the general notion of under what circumstances should they be allowed to do things. In addition to being illegal, Gates suggests that the tactics used by Snowden--who dumped reems of files that incriminate the federal government for, among other things, its domestic spying program--don't really accomplish much good. Instead, Snowden has put both the public and the government on the defensive. 'You . won't find any admiration from me,' he said. 'There has to be a debate. But the specific techniques they use become unavailable if they're . discussed in detail. So the debate needs to be about the general notion . of under what circumstances should they be allowed to do things.' Gates says that Snowden, seen here via videoconference at the 2014 SXSW Festival, used tactics that inevitably left everyone on the defensive, improving nothing. But the billionaire says he's one of a group of 'highly qualified people' who have the right tools to fix the world's problems . But the same could be said for Gates' view of the federal government, which he calls one of the world's best while also pointing out it's weak spots. 'You have to have a certain realism that government is a pretty blunt instrument,' he said. 'And without the constant attention of highly qualified people with the right metrics, it will fall into not doing things very well.' And who better to be one of those 'highly qualified people' than Gates' himself, whose Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation puts its $36 billion endowment toward improving civilization as a whole, from the bottom up. The charity has task forces for wiping out polio and other disease, turning the tide of climate change, and ending world hunger among other admirable if lofty goals. And in light of all that, the likes of Edward Snowden tucked away in Russia seems trivial. 'I see governments in very poor countries that can't even get teachers to show up. So in countries like that, how can you get very basic things to work? That's something I spend a lot of time on. And these things are all solvable,' he said.","The world's richest man revealed his opinion of the American whistleblower in a sit-down with Rolling Stone .

A frantic mother pleaded with her ex-husband to release her step-daughter moments before he shot the child in the head in a planned revenge killing. Ricky Blackwell, 55, from Chesnee, South Carolina was found guilty of murder after lured his ex-wife Angela Davis and her step-daughter, Heather Brooke Center, to come to his trailer for a swim on July 8, 2009. Spartanburg County Court heard that Blackwell was angry because Ms Davis had left him 18 months earlier for the eight-year old's father, Bobby Center. Ricky Blackwell (right) is facing the death penalty after being found guilty of murdering his ex-wife's step-daughter Heather Brooke Center (left) in South Carolina. When the pair arrived, Blackwell grabbed the girl, Brooke, and put a .357 Magnum revolver to her head. Ms Davis admitted she had bought the gun for Blackwell as a present during their 27-year marriage. She said she pleaded with Blackwell to release her daughter and even offered herself in exchange. She told the court she was screaming 'let her go Ricky, please it's me you want, take me,' according to a report by GoUpState.com . Ms Davis said her ex-husband replied: 'You've pushed this too far. You did this and you tell me what Bobby thinks of this. 'Then the gun went off and it went off again.' In total, Blackwell shot the youngster four times at point-black range. Blackwell's solicitor Bill McGuire asked the court to consider his client's mental state at the time of the murder. He said his client should not be judged entirely on what happened during those six seconds. Mr McGuire said Blackwell's ex-wife 'was the air that he breathed, the sun in his universe. But she didn't stay there. She left. She took up an adulterous affair with Bobby Center'. Master Deputy Bill Meyer of Spartanburg County Sheriff's office said he arrived at the scene less than five minutes after shooting . He said he saw a small child lying face down between a trailer and an inflatable swimming pool. He said an eyewitness identified Blackwell as the shooter. The jury took just 20 minutes to find Blackwell guilty of murder. The court will decide whether Blackwell will face the death penalty later today.","Ricky Blackwell lured ex-wife Angela Davis to his trailer for a swim .

Judge Judy, known for her high profile deliberations on televised drama-filled court cases, has filed a lawsuit of her own as she claims a lawyer used her image without her consent. The television judge, full name Judy Sheindlin, is filing a lawsuit against a Connecticut personal-injury lawyer, alleging that he had falsely produced advertisements saying she had endorsed his firm. She is seeking more than $75,000 in damages from Hartford attorney John Haymond and his firm, which mainly represents people seeking compensation for injuries. The lawsuit is the first that Judge Judy has ever filed, and she claims that it is because he is 'shamelessly' using her image to promote himself without permission . Judith Sheindlin - otherwise known by her TV handle Judge Judy, has starred in her show of the same name for 18 years, and this lawsuit marks the first time she has filed anything of this kind against anyone. She said the unauthorised use of her name and image is 'outrageous' and requires action. She said: 'Mr Haymond is a lawyer and should know better. Judy Sheindlin says that if she wins, all of the proceeds will go to the 'Her Honor' scholarship scheme . The lawsuit says that without Sheindlin's permission, Haymond's firm aired television advertisements combining footage from 'Judge Judy' along with clips showing Haymond and his daughters, in an endorsement for the firm. It also says the advertisements aired in Connecticut and Massachusetts during broadcasts of her show, and continued even after Sheindlin's producer told the firm in March 2013 that use of her image was not permitted.

A man is being hailed a hero from across the Atlantic after saving a drowning workmate from the bottom of a ferocious 80ft waterfall. Businessman Garry Smith braved the plunge-pool of the 80ft waterfall in the US after his colleague, Suresh Nath, 44, fell into the torrent and was knocked unconscious. After swimming to his aid and dragging him to safety, Mr Smith used the lifesaving  skills he'd picked up as a volunteer lifeguard to get his friend breathing again - performing CPR until emergency services arrived. Hero grandfather Garry Smith used his life-saving skills developed at a Sheffield swimming pool to save drowning friend, Suresh Nath. Mr Nath slipped while taking a photograph of the Ithaca Falls in New York State . Now the 59-year-old, a technical director for oil and gas industry supplier Howco, is to be honoured with a bravery award. Mr Smith said: 'It's an event I would rather of not happened in the first place. It's humbling, and not something I would have gone around shouting about because it's a situation I wouldn't like anybody to get into. 'But if it alerts people to the importance of learning to swim that's okay. This guy had never learned how to swim, and it's a key life skill.' The grandfather from Sheffield, south Yorkshire has worked at the company for 16 years and was in the US to do some work for the American branch of the firm. Garry Smith, who is photographed with his wife Heather, saved Sureth Nath from the waterfall in Ithaca, New York State, and performed CPR until emergency help arrived . He and his American colleague, Mr Nath, 44, had some free time after completing their day's work and the pair decided to visit Ithaca Falls in New York state. Mr Smith said: ' 'I stopped to take a photo, looked up and my colleague had disappeared. I'd completely lost sight of him. 'When I looked up I saw him, fully clothed, in the water. 'He had walked towards the waterfall to take a photo along the side of it, stood on a small rock which acted like a ball bearing, lost his footing and went straight over the edge. 'I realised he was drowning and in serious trouble.' The father-of-three rushed to find something to save Mr Nath, but realised he was rapidly running out of time.

'At first I tried to find a branch to pull him out with but he was being dragged under the water. I had no option but to help. My heart was saying I should go in but my head was saying it was dangerous. 'I started to wade into the water until I had to swim. At this point he was upside down and unconscious, so I pulled him to the edge of the water. 'There was no sign of life. He wasn't in a good state and I started giving him mouth to mouth. 'After about five minutes the emergency services appeared and took over.' The oil worker had learned lifesaving skills as he volunteered for a swimming club in Sheffield and later Concord leisure centres for a number of years. Mr Nath spent three days in hospital but made a full recovery and is now back at work. Speaking of his family's feelings about the incident Mr Smith said: 'We've not really said too much about it really because it's not something anybody wants to happen. 'I do know they are proud though, especially now.' The Mayor of Ithaca and the Chief of Police have arranged for Mr Smith to be awarded with a Medal for Bravery at a ceremony in Sheffield.

Furor is building in Los Angeles over video of BMX riders hopping over homeless people on Skid Row. A video shot last month showing pro BMX riders Brandon Begin, Jeff Cadger and David Grant bunny hopping sleeping homeless people in the seedy neighborhood has upset many, and so has the video poster’s lack of remorse of the shocking footage. Bike store owner Adam Grandmaison initially apologized on Facebook to anyone offended by the video, but has since gone on multiple rants against those offended and even written a column saying the footage is good for the sport. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocking: BMX riders used Skid Row homeless as props for stunts in a video shot last month . Up and over: This homeless person watches helplessly as a BMX rider bunny hops over his legs . The fifteen second video posted February 26 to Facebook shows the trio bunny hopping over the legs of destitute people in LA’s drug-addled Skid Row. Multiple riders are shown even doing tricks in the air over the people while treating them as worthless props. ‘This is just a matter of not having value for another human being,’ Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson Deon Joseph told NBC Los Angeles. The LAPD has not brought any criminal charges against the riders because it does not believe any laws were broken, a department source told CBS Los Angeles, but others were still outraged over the video. ‘Homeless people should be treated with respect and they’re not furniture,’ a person told NBC LA. Defiant: Store owner Adam Grandmaison (left) has defended store-sponsored rider Brandon Begin (right) and the video, even calling it good for the sport of BMX . Demeaning: One person complained to local media saying the homeless are people and 'not furniture' Dynamic duo: Jeff Cadger (left) and David Grant (right) were both shown bunny hopping homeless . ‘That’s not right, it’s not right,’ a homeless person told the station. ‘It’s exploitation of the homeless people,’ said another. Grandmaison’s initial apology to Facebook drew derision from many who pointed out that he refused to delete the post. ‘Then remove the video... [what the f**k] is wrong with you?’ Asked A.J. Herrera. 'Unacceptable: Many people spoke out against the video posting on the BMX store's Facebook page . 'Take it down': Others called for the video to be removed . Infamous: Skid Row has long been home to homeless and drug addicts . ‘Good for you for saying that you don’t condone it... now take down the video,’ said Yosi Sergant. Others called the original post on the bike store’s Facebook page was ‘a horrible display of inhumanity’ and ‘unacceptable.’ Multiple people called it disrespectful. Grandmaison told CBS LA that if he has ‘to take a little flack for something that’s controversial in order for people to realize there is a big BMX scene out in LA, [he] can deal with it.’ Those comments came after he told NBC LA that he didn’t see why people were offended by the video. ‘All’s well that ends well, I guess, you know, because nobody did get hurt,’ he added. He also wrote in a skating magazine that ‘maybe, just maybe, some little kid will see that video and get motivated to ride down the street and bunnyhop over some s**t, human or not,’ according to multiple reports. Begin is sponsored by the store on whose Facebook page the video was posted, according to reports. The store's owner initially tried to deny anyone involved with the store had anything to do with the video .

The St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said 17-year-old Lauren Bush and an unnaned 15-year-old girl - both students at Chopticon High School in Morganza, Maryland - recorded the assaults against the autistic 16-year-old victim on their cell phones. Footage shows the suspects force the teen to walk on a partially frozen pond, which resulted in him falling through the ice several times. Each time, police said, the suspects refused to help the boy out of the frigid water. Sheriff Tim Cameron told ABC7 that the allegations leveled against the girls are among the most disturbing he has dealt with in his career. He says that several times between December and February, the suspects preyed on the victim â€“ assaulting him with a knife, kicking him in the groin, dragging him by the hair, coercing him to engage in a sex act with an animal, and forcing him to walk on the partially frozen pond. â€˜Another video depicts the male on an icy pond being told to continue to walk out further, actually falling in the water several times and pulling himself out,â€™ said Cameron.

The Flying Duck orchid (left) bearing a striking resemblance to the Warner Brothers cartoon character Daffy Duck (right) So well-known for its similarities to the charismatic duck's yellow bill and black head, the orchid is known as the Flying Duck. Daffy Duck appeared in cartoon series such as Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, where he usually has been depicted as the best friend and occasional arch-rival of Bugs Bunny. Daffy emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier in the decade, such as Mickey Mouse and Popeye. Daffy Duck is one of the most popular members of the Looney Toons family, being the third-most frequently appearing cartoon character in the famous shorts . Daffy starred in golden age 133 shorts, making him the third-most frequent character in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny's 166 appearances and Porky Pig's 159 appearances. Daffy first appeared in Porky's Duck Hunt, released on April 17, 1937, and directed by Tex Avery and animated by Bob Clampett. The orchid, indigenous to Tasmania, is known for its resemblance to the cartoon character to the point that it is named 'The Flying Duck' The only aspects of the character that have stayed the same through the years are his voice characterization by Mel Blanc and his black feathers with a white neck ring. Blanc's characterization of Daffy holds the world record for the longest characterisation of one animated character by the original actor at 52 years.","The orchid, indigenous to Tasmania, is known as the Flying Duck .

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is backing calls for reduced sentences for certain drug offences in order to unclog the federal prison system, which has been overpopulated for years. Holder hopes the new plan will reduce the vast prison population by 6,500 inmates over the next five years. Later today, he is due to deliver a statement before the U.S. Sentencing Commission that sentences will still be very tough for violent criminals while he attempts to finds ways to cut costs in the prison system. U.S Attorney General Eric Holder has been campaigning for the sentence reductions for low-level drug offences as a part of Obama's 'Smart on Crime' initiative, which hopes to cut costs in the prison system . Under the proposed plan, the average sentence for drug trafficking could drop from the regularly proposed 62 months to as low as 51 months. This means the plan could eventually lead to cut prison sentences for drug convicts by an average of nearly a year, according to the Justice Department. The change would affect around 70 per cent of those sentenced for federal drug trafficking offences. Holder's move is part of Obama's 'Smart on Crime' initiative platform which he has touted since 2013. In . a joint effort between conservative lawmakers and governors, the . Attorney General has been vocal in backing reduced reliance on . prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders. Drug trafficking offences are the most common reasons for incarceration at a federal prison, and Holder hopes that by changing sentencing legislation regarding drug trafficking sentences he might reduce the prison sentence by 6,500 in five years . In extracts of his statement, due to be delivered later today, he says: 'This overreliance on incarceration is not just financially unsustainable . -- it comes with human and moral costs that are impossible to calculate.' However, it is likely these reforms . will be enacted on a case by case basis, with only certain non-violent . offenders getting consideration for leniency. Those . with charges involving small or moderate amounts of drugs may face a . reduction in their sentences, but those involved with large amounts of . drugs will not benefit. The federal prison system has been drastically over-clogged for a good period of time, with the U.S. housing 25 per cent of all the world's criminals . The Sentencing Commission won't vote . on the move until April, but in the meantime Holder will be instructing . federal prosecutors not to oppose defense motions seeking lower . sentences for drug charges - as per his proposal. For now, most federal judges sentence within the guidelines range, with 2005 legislation from the Supreme Court ruling that judges must consider recommended sentences, but do not have to necessarily follow it. The 'Smart on Crime' imitative seeks to reduce the federal prison population, along with the costs that come with it, while still preserving public safety. The initiative focuses on crime diversion programs, as well as more advanced drug and veteran courts, as well as attempting to draft new criminal charges for low-level drug offenders that do not trigger mandatory federal prison sentences - which clog up the prison system. Holder said in a statement last year: 'Too many Americans go to too many prisons for far too long and for no truly good law enforcement reason.' If the vote is successful and the new sentencing guidelines are approved, prisoners who have already been sentenced that would be eligible for a smaller sentence will be able to apply for re-sentencing. Holder's plan has come after months of debating about the overcrowding in the U.S. federal prison system, which many agreed needed to be drastically dealt with, but with nobody really sure which tactic to pursue. Previous proposals included a review of sentence disparities, such as those between white males and black males (black male offenders often received 20 per cent longer sentences that white male offenders committing the same crimes), improving counseling and rehabilitation programs to reduce re-offenders, and compassionate early release of elderly members of federal prisons. The proposal to change mandatory jail time for drug charges was endorsed by Arizona criminal defense attorney, who said in August 2013: 'We need to get rid of the mandatory . sentencing system, even if the policy changes Federal law; states handle . the vast majority of drug cases.'","Holder says reducing drug sentencing would unclog prisons .

Daniel Andreas San Diego, an animal rights activist, who the FBI are hunting for charges of exploding pipe bombs at companies linked to animal experiments. He is considered armed and dangerous, and the agency are offering $250,000 for any information . The FBI has mobilised to Hawaii after receiving what they call 'credible intelligence' that a domestic terrorist suspect on their most wanted list may be hiding on the island. Agents are hunting for Daniel Andreas San Diego in the eastern part of the state's 'Big Island', in the eastern district of Puna, focusing on the small town of Pahoa. They launched the search when they receiving intelligence that he has been spotted on the island, after he slipped the FBI's 24 hour surveillance in downtown San Francisco in 2003. San Diego, 36, is suspected to be a domestic rights extremist, charged with exploding pipe bombs in front of buildings of two companies tied to animal experiment labs in the San Francisco Bay Area. He currently tops the FBI's most wanted terrorist list and is considered armed and dangerous, and is believed to possess a gun. The agency are currently offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to his capture. The FBI interviewed Kai Sorte, a local organic deli manager in Pahoa, who said agents had visited the small town 18 months ago in search of San Diego. Sorte was interviewed again by agents earlier this week, and said they believe San Diego is 'looking for some sort of cause or movement' to join. The trip to Hawaii may have been part of the recent push to get information on San Diego, who has been at large since 2003 after slipping an FBI tail. Earlier this month San Diego's image appeared on several electronic billboards across the country, including above Times Square in New York City earlier this month. San Diego was raised in an upper-middle class family in a suburb of San Francisco. His father, Edmund San Diego, a city manager of a wealthy San Francisco community has refused to talk about his son. San Diego is charged with setting off three bombs at two biotechnology companies in the early hours of the morning on August 28 and September 26 2003. No one was injured in the explosions, but windows were shattered and the building suffered minor damage. The FBI received credible intelligence from the shopkeeper of an organic food store that San Diego has been seen on Big Island in Hawaii, 'looking for a cause to join' Two pipe bomb explosions struck the Chiron Corporation, a company tied to animal experiments, with investigators believing the second pipe bomb was designed to harm authorities responding to the incident. A third bomb, strapped with nails, hit Shaklee Corp, a cosmetic maker, a month later. FBI have been searching for San Diego across the world, contacting officials in Germany, the U.K, Costa Rica, France, Spain, Denmark, Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic, Mexico, Argentina, the Philippines and Chile. San Diego has been linked to animal rights extremist groups, and has been identified as a vegan who doesn't eat food containing animal products. In the past, he has worked as a computer network specialist, and is skilled with different operating systems, as well as sailing. The FBI said he can also be identified by his unusual tattoos, including a round image of burning hillsides on his chest, emblazoned below with the words 'It only takes a spark', and a tattoo spanning his back and abdomen portraying burning and collapsing buildings.

Quotable: The scene's punchline comes when an older patron tells her waiter: 'I'll have what she's having' In addition to playing off the original deli's name, Katz & Dogz food trucks sells a sandwich called the 'Reuben Orgasm' which the original deli believes is a 'blatant' attempt to dupe customers. Customers are likely to assume that the trucks, which sell the same Jewish-style fare, and the famed deli are somehow affiliated, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Wednesday.

The deli's owners are seeking an order to bar the trucks from using any name that could easily be confused with Katz's. Katz's owners claim they offered Katz & Dogz $7,000 to change the name but that the truck owners reneged on the deal before it was finalized. Reached by telephone, an owner of Katz & Dogz who identified himself as Tarek, said the deli owners had been 'pushy' and 'not polite' when they approached him about a name change. He declined to comment on the lawsuit because he said he had not seen it.

Bill O'Reilly has launched an unprovoked attack on Beyoncé's latest video, labeling the work 'exploitative garbage' and suggested that it will encourage teenage pregnancy among African American girls. Confronting hip hop mogul Rusell Simmons on Monday night, the Fox News host appeared outraged at explicit imagery of Beyoncé having sex in a car and referencing Monica Lewinsky in her Partition video. O’Reilly said the video 'glorifies having sex in the back of a limousine,' and then warmed to his point saying, 'Teenage girls look up to Beyoncé, particularly girls of color. She’s an idol to them,"" he continued. “I’m saying: Why on earth would this woman do that? 'Why would she do it when she knows the devastation that unwanted pregnancies - and fractured families - why would Beyoncé do that?' Scroll Down for Video . Confrontation: Bill O'Reilly and hip hop mogul Russell Simmons face-off on Monday's O'Reilly Factor show discussing Beyoncé's new video for her song Partition . The 64-year-old host of the The O'Reilly Factor insisted to Simmons that Beyoncé has 'an obligation to protect children' and not to put out 'exploitative garbage.' Giving no quarter, Simmons, who co-founded Def Jam Recordings in 1983, attempted to explain but O'Reilly became confused when the video and music was referred to as art. 'Bill, if you think that art that comes out of a community is the cause of the struggle–' 'That’s art?' O’Reilly interrupted. 'Yes, absolutely,' Simmons responded. 'Beyoncé in the back of a limo having sex and referencing Monica Lewinsky is art?' O'Reilly shouted. 'She's a brilliant artist,' Simmons shot back. 'And she's not only appreciated by people of color, as you know, she's really one of the top artists in the world to people of every color.' Defense: Russell Simmons said that Beyoncé was an artist and her works reflects what is going on in the world and how she sees it . During the course of the typically confrontational interview, O'Reilly badgered Simmons who was on the show to promote his new book on meditation, which O'Reilly mispronounced as mediation. O'Reilly led into the interview saying, 'As you know, I've been very critical of harmful entertainment marketed to largely unsupervised children.' He admitted he loved Beyoncé's Superbowl performance 'brilliant' but attacked the video to Partition - in which the singer appears to be performing sexually provocative dance moves for the benefit of her partner of ten-years, Jay-Z. Simmons tried to dodge any questions of the video, but said that he did 'think the artist's job throughout history has been to tell the same things that people are inspired by...so when an artist expresses something that is sexual in music, it's a reflection of our reality.')

'...What about the kids who don't have an amazing mother and an okay father? What about them?' Later in the discussion O'Reilly attacked Beyoncé's husband Jay Z and his friend Kanye West, to call the pair gangsta rappers and that he considers them responsible for influencing the youth in a negative way.

The factory then added V8 wheels, hubs and V8 badging to the Aston Martin. Developing around 285bhp, the aggressive looking DBS was capable of 0-60mph in 7.1 seconds and a top speed of 140mph. The car had personalised number plates of Lord Brett Sinclair's initials, 'BS 1', in every episode - except for one scene in the episode The Gold Napoleon where the car had its original UK registration number PPP 6H instead. The show ran for 24 episodes before Moore was snapped up to play James Bond. During this period, the Aston Martin covered 5,000 miles and ‘took some punishment’, with Aston Martin servicing the car and selling it on to its next owner.

The DBS has now been secured by auctioneers Bonhams ahead of its annual Aston Martin sale, which takes place on May 17 in Newport Pagnell. It is expected to sell for a whopping £550,000 when it goes under the hammer.

Since it found fame on The Persuaders, the car has had five owners and has spent the past three years appearing at some of the world's most prestigious automotive shows including the 2013 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este at Lake Como, Italy . Tim Schofield, from the auction house, added: ‘It is one of the most instantly recognisable cars from TV. ‘The car is in wonderful condition, it was restored around 20 years ago by Aston Martin and has been beautifully maintained. ‘The car is attached to a well-known personality and TV show and we are expecting a lot of interest in it.’ Both Roger Moore and Tony Curtis featured in the hit television show The Persuaders . The Persuaders was a hit action/adventure television show which aired during 1971 and 1972. It followed the lives of Lord Brett Sinclair (played by Roger Moore) and Danny Wilde (Tony Curtis) who reluctantly teamed up to solve cases which the courts were unable to. The pair were from very different backgrounds with Sinclair being a British aristocrat, a former British Army officer and ex-racing car driver, and Wilde having endured a tough childhood while growing up in New York City. The show was famed for its unusual ‘split-screen’ title sequence which depicted the lives and background of both characters in the form of ‘case-files’. It was said to be specifically designed so that neither actor would appear to have top billing, something both Moore and Curtis stipulated when they agreed to co-star. The ITV show ran for 24 episodes between 17 September 1971 and 25 February 1972 before Roger Moore was snapped up to play James Bond. It wasn’t renewed for another series. It was filmed in France, Italy and England between May 1970 and June 1971.","The customised Aston Martin DBS has had five owners since finding fame .

Rita Smith choked to death on fish and chips when she should only have been provided with pureed food . A 'vulnerable and elderly' woman who should have been provided with pureed food choked to death on fish and chips in a care home. The care home provider has been fined £170,000 after 75-year-old Rita Smith died in Euxton, near Chorley, Lancashire. Four Seasons Health Care was prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) after the investigation found there had been an ‘alarming lack of communication’, with many staff unaware of Miss Smith’s ‘well documented’ needs. Her family described the death as ‘disgraceful and unnecessary’. Preston Crown Court was told that Miss Smith, who suffered from dementia and motor neurone disease, was admitted into Euxton Park Care Home in November 2010. The home was made aware that Miss Smith had difficulty swallowing, needed pureed food on a teaspoon and supervision by a carer while eating, the HSE said. Two weeks later, she was given fish and chips in a cone along with other residents while she was at a film and supper evening in the care home on December 1. When a member of staff began clearing up the meals during the film, she noticed Miss Smith slumped in her chair. A nurse attempted to resuscitate her but she was later pronounced dead. A post mortem found the primary cause of death was choking. The HSE investigation into the incident found neither of the staff who organised the film and supper evening had been made aware that Miss Smith could not eat solid foods. A specialist assessment carried out at the local hospital, recommending she be supervised at meals and prompted to slow down and swallow twice during each mouthful, had been provided to the care home but was not communicated to staff, the HSE said. It added that a care plan and risk assessment had also not been completed by Four Seasons for Miss Smith on her arrival at the home, which would have identified the need for a care worker to feed her pureed food during meal times. It also emerged that a carer at the home had left Miss Smith alone to eat un-pureed Weetabix a few days before the film and supper evening. Four Seasons Health Care (England) Ltd, part of the Four Seasons Health Care group which runs more than 500 care homes and specialist care centres in the UK, pleaded guilty to a single breach of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, the HSE said. This photograph shows Euxton Park Care Home, which Miss Smith was admitted to in November 2010 . The company, of Douglas, Isle of Man, was fined £125,000 and ordered to pay £45,000 towards the cost of the prosecution. Speaking after the hearing, HSE inspector Shellie Bee said: ‘This was a tragic death which could have been avoided if Four Seasons Health Care had made sure systems were in place to protect residents. As it was, a vulnerable and elderly woman paid the price for their failures. ‘Our investigation found there had been an alarming lack of communication with many staff unaware of Miss Smith's medical needs, despite them being well documented. ‘She should never have been given un-pureed food, let alone been left by herself to eat it during the film and supper evening. But her condition meant she did not have the mental capability to refuse the meal or recognise the danger. ‘Euxton Park Care Home was made aware of the risk of Miss Smith choking on un-pureed food when she arrived, but failed to act properly and as you would expect on this information. Sadly, she lost her life as a result.’ Preston Crown Court (pictured) was told that Miss Smith, who suffered from dementia and motor neurone disease, was admitted into Euxton Park Care Home in November 2010 . Miss Smith's family also released the following statement after the case: ‘We are grateful to the Health and Safety Executive for the professional and sensitive way in which they have liaised with our family following the disgraceful and unnecessary death of Rita, three years ago. ‘Rita was in the Euxton Park Care Home for a mere two weeks before this frightening and tragic event occurred. ‘Our hope is that the seriousness and financial implications of this case for the company will ensure that nothing like this will ever happen again at a Four Seasons or any other care home. This would mean that Rita's tragic death will not have been entirely in vain.’","Rita Smith should have been provided with pureed food, investigation found .

Jailed: Laura Cunliffe pictured at Barnsley Magistrates' Court, which sentenced her to a 14-week term . A woman who killed her kitten by cooking it in a microwave has been jailed for 14 weeks 'as a deterrent', with the judge describing it as ‘an act of utterly horrendous cruelty’. Vets said that the animal would have endured horrific pain and it was said to be 'screeching' before it died 90 minutes later. Laura Cunliffe, 23, admitted putting black-and-white Mowgli into the oven and turning it on for five minutes after finding the remains of the fish on the floor, Barnsley Magistrates’ Court heard. Cunliffe said she rescued it after about a minute, when she realised what she had done, but the kitten died later. District Judge John Foster said he had to jail Cunliffe as a deterrent - a decision that caused outrage among her family in the public gallery. Mr Foster had been told by Cunliffe’s solicitor, Alan Greaves, that his client has longstanding problems with psychotic depression and has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act 20 times. As the defendant was led away in handcuffs, one member of her family shouted: ‘She doesn’t know what’s happening - she hasn’t a clue.’ Another shouted: ‘This is a failure of medical services, judge.’ Mr Foster told the defendant: ‘This was an act of utterly horrendous cruelty on your part on an animal that, as far as I could see, had come to trust you and rely on you.’ The district judge said Cunliffe’s actions were ‘inexplicable’. Cunliffe, of Hoyland, Barnsley, admitted one charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal at a previous hearing. She was banned from keeping animals for life and was told she cannot apply to have this ban reviewed for five years. Brian Orsborn, prosecuting for the RSPCA, told the court that Cunliffe took Mowgli to her stepsister's house after the incident in September last year, wrapped in a towel after attempting to cool the kitten down with water. Mr Orsborn said the relative described the animal as ‘proper screeching’ before it died and vets said later that it would have suffered a painful death, with terrible damage to its internal organs. In the days after the incident, the defendant went to Barnsley Hospital, where she also confessed what she had done to nurses on the psychiatric ward. These two horrific RSPCA photos show the dead animal and its burnt paws. The kitten died around 90 minutes after it was put in the microwave by . Cunliffe, a court heard earlier . According to Mr Orsborn, Cunliffe said the kitten had woken her up, because it wanted feeding but, when she went to the kitchen, the goldfish was in pieces. He said: ‘She thought that the kitten had killed the fish and she was really upset and angry with the cat and she said she put the cat in the microwave.’ The prosecutor said Cunliffe told nurses that she had stopped taking her medication because she did not want to fall into a deep sleep in case the kitten attacked the fish. But Mr Orsborn told the district judge: ‘There's nothing to suggest at the time she was actually psychotic.’ He said she told her step-sister: ‘I've put the cat in the microwave.’ He said Cunliffe also said: ‘I looked at the cat and thought “You evil, f****** bitch”.’ The cat took 90 minutes to die, the court heard earlier. Mr Greaves told the court his client was extremely sorry for what she had done and he described it as a ‘shocking, disturbing and horrendous case’. He added: ‘She still can't believe what she's done.’ The solicitor detailed Cunliffe's extensive mental health problems, which he said were a result of a psychotic form of depression. He said she heard voices and believed that things she saw on TV were real. Mr Greaves said his client had stopped taking her medication because ‘the Queen had told her not to’. He said Cunliffe's actions were all the more inexplicable because she loved animals and had cared for the kitten, which was less than a year old. He said Cunliffe would carry the animal everywhere with her under her jacket and had ‘loved it more than anything else’. But when he was pressed by the district judge about whether his client ‘knew what she was doing’, Mr Greaves said: ‘I'm afraid that's right.’ He said she ‘just lost her temper’ and acted ‘totally out of character’. Sentencing Cunliffe, Mr Foster said: ‘I have concluded, after careful thought, that the utterly barbaric nature of the act that you carried out in relation to this animal does demand a deterrent sentence.’ The district judge refused an application for unemployed Cunliffe to make a contribution towards the RSPCA's costs, which he was told ran into hundreds of pounds. After the case, an RSPCA spokeswoman said: ‘This was such a sad case and clearly this poor kitten would have suffered terribly over a prolonged period of time. ‘Sentencing is a matter for the courts but we hope that this means that other animals will not have to suffer in this way in future.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Laura Cunliffe, 23, put kitten in microwave after it attacked goldfish .

A father who hanged himself in woods had a picture of his dead body posted on Twitter by mistake after an unwitting dog walker wrongly believed he was a 'ghoulish mannequin'. The passer-by spotted Robert Pilcher, 23, and unwittingly assumed his body was a giant Halloween dummy as part of a sick prank. He took a picture, uploaded it on social media and even tweeted it to his local council demanding it be removed - only to be tracked down by police later and told the tragic truth. Robert Pilcher took his own life weeks after the birth of his son Bobby James. His body was found hanging in woods near his home in Cleveleys, Lancs . Mr Pilcher, 23, was suffering from depression after splitting from the mother of his baby, Jayne Marr (right) An inquest was told sheet metal worker Mr Pilcher, who was suffering from depression, had taken his own life just eight weeks after the birth of his first son Bobby James. He had been split from Bobby's mother Jayne Marr, 25, and discovered his mother Elaine had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He had moved out of the family home in Fleetwood, Lancs and was staying with a female friend he had known for six years, Savannah Sinclair. On the night before he died in October last year, Mr Pilcher visited Bobby and made a last ditch attempt to rekindle his romance with Miss Marr - but she said they couldn't get back together. In a statement Miss Sinclair said she had called 999 to report Robert missing after he left the house telling her he was going for a walk, yet failed to take his mobile phone. She said: 'He had recently had a baby with his partner. He text to see if my couch was free, I spoke to Robert and he said he wanted to pay off his debts like his phone bill, nothing serious. 'He never intimated that he wanted to take his own life. He would say, ""everybody would be better if I wasn't here"" and ""nobody would notice if I wasn't"". He did get down.' Friends say they had no idea the 'larger than life' sheet metal worker was intent on committing suicide . Skateboard-loving Mr Pilcher died just eight weeks after the birth of his first son Bobby James . Miss Sinclair added that she knew his mum was very ill with cancer and they would often sit and talk about it. She added: 'He recently thought about visiting the doctor about depression but I'm not sure if he did. 'Because of his recent frame of mind I kept an eye on him and checked his bag but I never found anything.' She said that Mr Pilcher had looked 'a bit down' but when she asked if he wanted to talk he said he would in the morning. Miss Sinclair said that before she went to bed she saw him walk away and he gestured that he was going for a walk. She added that she asked him not to go. Mr Pilcher, who had attempted suicide before, was a keen skateboarder who coached young skaters at a local YMCA . He made a last ditch attempt to rekindle his relationship with Jayne Marr, the mother of his baby, before taking his own life, a inquest heard . Police were called to the scene in woodland known as The Towers the following morning. Det Insp Andrew Bunn of Lancashire Police said the location was accessible to the public yet would have been secluded at the time Mr Pilcher went. The officer said the dog walker had taken the picture in good faith because he had been concerned children might be shocked. He said: 'The picture of him whilst still hanging was put on Twitter, inquiries were made and we spoke to the person who had put it on the website. 'It was in good faith, a man walking his dog in the early hours. He didn't think it was a body but that it was some sort of ghoulish mannequin. He sent it to Wyre Council asking it to be removed.' The hearing in Fleetwood was told police investigated 'insensitive messages' on social media sites which caused distress to Robert's family, but there had been nothing suspicious. Police found his body hanging in woodland known as The Towers after he went for a walk late at night . A dog walker thought his body was a dummy put up as a prank and asked the local council to take it down . In a statement, Mr Pilcher's father Chris, 51, said: 'Robert had made several half-hearted attempts to take his own life using pills. It last took place a couple of years ago. 'I felt they were cries for help. He suffered from what I would describe as depression but he would never accept it or seek advice.' He said on the occasions when he had seen medical professionals Robert 'always knew what to say to get discharged'. Mr Pilcher Snr added: 'His mother had terminal cancer and he recently split from his partner but there was nothing about his behaviour for me to have any concerns about his welfare. 'The night before he died had been to see his son and ex-partner and asked if he could get back together, she said no. He sent a text to his mum saying he loved her.' The hearing was told Elaine, 48, passed away last January. Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Mr Simon Jones said: 'It was a publicly accessible area and there's some degree of planning. There was no written expression of intent. 'I'm satisfied that what he has done has been done intentionally. ' Mr Pilcher was a keen skateboarder who coached younger enthusiasts at a local YMCA. In interview with the family's local paper at the time of the tragedy Mr Pilcher's late mother, Elaine, said: 'We didn't know he was that sad because he didn't give any warning signs, he just texted me on Monday telling me he loved me. 'I replied straight away asking if he was OK and I tried to ring him back but he had already turned his phone off. 'He was a fun-loving guy who had just become a father and had his whole life ahead of him. He was larger than life and unmistakable - a gentle giant and very friendly. 'When he became a father I thought he would get on with his life. I never thought this would happen, so it came as a complete shock and he will be greatly missed by everyone who knew him.'

It was thought all the antiques and items of vintage clothing, which went on to be sold, had been discovered but historians have now uncovered a secret hoard of war memorabilia.

Two rush hour trains were cancelled because health and safety rules banned a pair of ticket collectors from leaving their broken down taxi and walking to a station just yards away. London Midland bosses left hundreds of commuters stranded on Tuesday night when they scrapped the busy trains from Birmingham to Herefordshire after the conductors failed to make it to the station on time. The pair had been making their way between the city's Snow Hill and New Street stations - a half-mile walk which takes less than 10 minutes. Two rush hour trains were cancelled because ticket collectors were banned from leaving their broken down taxi and the distance between Snow Hill station (red) and New Street station (blue) The pair had been making their way between the city's Snow Hill and New Street stations - a half-mile walk which takes less than 10 minutes . But when their taxi broke down the company decided to cancel the 17.49 to Hereford and 17.59 to Great Malvern services leaving hundreds of commuters stranded for up to an hour. Train bosses deemed the walk 'too dangerous' for their two conductors because they were carrying money. The journey would have even been quicker on foot due to the pedestrianisation of Birmingham city centre as cars are forced to make a two-mile detour. London Midland bosses scrapped the busy commuter trains from Birmingham to Herefordshire on Tuesday after two conductors failed to make it to the station on time . Passenger Freddie Gundersen, 38, an IT consultant, from Birmingham, added: 'At 5pm the traffic in Birmingham is a nightmare and because of pedestrianised streets it would have been much quicker to walk' Today train passengers slammed the decision to cancel the trains - branding it 'health and safety gone mad.' PR executive Paula Yates, 30, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, was stranded at New Street station for 45 minutes. She fumed: 'You couldn't get two train stations closer to each other. It wasn't like they would be asking the staff to walk down a back alley in the middle of the night. 'This was a short walk across a safe city at a busy time of day and you would expect them to be able to make a logical and sensible exception to their rules. 'But because of ridiculous red-tape yet again we see an absurd example of health and safety rules gone stark raving mad.' A London Midland spokeswoman defended the move and said it was company policy to provide taxis for conductors travelling between stations for their 'safety and protection' (file photo) Another passenger Freddie Gundersen, 38, an IT consultant, from Birmingham, added: 'At 5pm the traffic in Birmingham is a nightmare and because of pedestrianised streets it would have been much quicker to walk. 'It is absolutely disgusting that they would cancel two packed trains because of so-called company policy. 'The thing that gets me with these sort of companies is why common sense never seems to prevail. It is just baffling that they can treat customers this way.' Computer science student Daniel Mander, 19, was stuck at University station and his journey home to Bromsgrove was delayed by around 40 minutes. He wrote to London Midland on Twitter: 'Could you please pass on that it is generally quicker to walk between the two stations!' A spokesman for Passenger Focus, a commuter support group, added: 'Clearly this was irritating for passengers, so we'll establish from London Midland why its staff were unable to walk' PR executive Paula Yates, 30, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, was stranded at New Street station for 45 minutes . Mr Mander, who pays Â£275 for a three-month rail ticket, said: 'The two stations are a five minute walk apart. 'With the traffic in the city centre I would imagine that it takes longer by taxi. 'I know that myself and a lot of other commuters are getting extremely fed up of the poor service from London Midland.'

Bad news: Ozil confirms on Twitter that he injured his hamstring very early in the match with Bayern . Arsene Wenger predicted on Tuesday night that the playmaker would be out for 'at least a few weeks' and said he would know more after further tests on Wednesday. With the manager's fears now realised, Arsenal's record signing faces an uphill battle to be fit for the club's FA Cup semi-final clash with Wigan Athletic on April 12 as they attempt to end their nine-year trophy drought. The worst-case scenario is that he will also miss the April league matches against Hull City and Newcastle United, and will not return until early May. No chance: Bastian Schweinsteiger opened the scoring for Bayern with a neat finish . Game on: But Lukas Podolski's equaliser had little bearing on the overall result . Speaking about Ozil in the immediate after of the Gunners’ Champions League exit, Wenger said: 'He has a hamstring injury that looks quite serious. I don’t know how long he will be out. For sure, he is out of Spurs. 'We have to make a scan tomorrow (Wednesday) to see how bad it is but he is out at least for a few weeks. I hope it’s not too bad.' Blow: Arsene Wenger could be without Ozil for six weeks . Ozil's setback is the latest in a series of serious injuries to senior members of Wenger's squad. Wilshere will miss around two months with a foot injury sustained on international duty last week and Theo Walcott is out until next season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

Tourists in one of the country's most picturesque regions can now enjoy some of its most famous sites all in one go. One hundred of the Lake District's top landmarks have been painstakingly recreated as a model village - entirely crafted out of locally sourced slate. Retired builder Edward Robinson, 67, has spent thousands of hours over the past 25 years making perfectly scaled models of attractions including Beatrix Potter's Hill Top, Bridge House at Ambleside and Townend Farmhouse at Troutbeck. The village is made using locally sourced slate, from areas including Hodge Close, Coniston and Elterwater . Mr Robinson said he started the project because he wanted to 'put something back' into the area he loved . Edward Robinson has spent a quarter of a century building his collection, he can now expect 6,000 visitors to come and see his handiwork every year . It has taken thousands of hours of work to put the village together but new pieces are still being added . Mr Robinson, 67, said he 'wanted to put something back' into the area he loves. 'I wanted to show how these buildings looked when I was a lad, rather than the plastic windows and everything you see nowadays.' Rarely using any kind of scaled drawings, much of the designs are in 'his head'. 'I'm not trying to be clever but I just have a knack somehow,' he said. 'It's just in me, I enjoy doing it.' The grandfather-of-two uses a diamond saw, a hammer, adhesive, sand, cement and a special chisel to faithfully recreate every detail of the buildings. The retired builder uses photos for the more complex replicas but manages to put many together from memory . Mr Robinson goes to great lengths and uses special tools to recreate every detail of the original buildings . Mr Robinson has become too old to use his workshop, so now builds the models at home . He only uses Lake District slate from Hodge Close, Coniston and Elterwater but has to look as far afield as America to find the fake moss he attaches to his designs. Every March, his wife Kathleen opens their gardens to the public as the Lakeland Miniature Village in Flookburgh. Fourteen years since they first welcomed in the public, they now expect to pull in around 6,000 visitors annually. New additions to the collection this year include Windermere's Baddeley Clock, the roadside monument halfway between Bowness and Windermere, and Yew Tree Farm, near Coniston. The Baddeley Clock model took Mr Robinson three months to make - using old photographs as he went along. He said: 'It's quite an icon, isn't it? I used to make them in my workshop but I'm too old for that now. In winter, my wife allows me to make them in the house, which is very kind of her.' Mrs Robinson said: 'I think they're marvellous. It takes a lot of skill and patience. He's a qualified builder and you can see he knows what he's doing.' As one recent visitor commented in the guest book: 'We have never seen anything like this before - it's absolutely beautiful. The level of craftsmanship is amazing.' While the slate is all local, Mr Robinson has to ship in the fake moss from as far afield as America .

A mysterious golden eagle with bells on its feet has been spotted by a group of cyclists in Wales. The huge bird, which is exceptionally rare in the UK, appeared tame and even allowed some of the group touch it. Experts insist the creature must have escaped from a sanctuary, but police in the area say they have not received reports from any sanctuaries or bird parks. Cyclists spotted a golden eagle perched near the cycle path on the Llanllwni Mountain in Carmarthenshire, Wales . The bird allowed mountain biker Jason Mulvey to touch and stroke it . The cyclists were cycling along a trail in the Llanllwni Mountain in Carmarthenshire when they came across the eagle. Mountain cyclists Nikki Channon and her husband Jason Mulvey said the massive bird was not distressed by group's presence and even let them stroke it. She added: 'It is obviously tame and lost but could cause damage or take local lambs if it gets very hungry. 'It is also huge and so could easily frighten the public - it allowed us to come very close. 'No doubt someone is very anxious to have lost this bird.' Cyclists Nikki Channon and husband Jason Mulvey said they are sure someone must be missing the bird . Golden eagles are now extremely rare in Britain and usually keep to remote mountains and hills . The cyclists are worried the lost bird may attack farm animals in the area if it is not returned to its owner . A spokesman for the RSPB said the birds were once common across Britain's mountains and hills, but are now mostly found at bird parks and zoos.

'They are commonly kept as falconerâ€™s birds or in bird of prey centres so this one is likely to have got away from its owner.' The spokesman added that golden eagles were once found in upland areas in many parts of the UK. 'However, persecution pushed these birds to extinction in England and Wales by 1850. 'They are now almost entirely restricted to Scotland. Sadly, the persecution of golden eagles and other birds of prey continues to this day.'

Traffic-related air pollution - the kind millions of drivers are exposed to during their twice-daily rush-hour commute - could trigger a potentially deadly change in the size of the heart, according to new major university study. The University of Washington Medical Center study found prolonged exposure to car pollutants causes the heart's right ventricle to increase in both mass and volume, which is directly linked to cardiovascular disease, heart failure and cardiac arrest. Going nowhere: A study has linked rush-hour traffic jams with serious heart disease . The study's 3896 participants were exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide - a gas emitted from the burning of fuel - similar to those found in heavy traffic. The participants underwent an MRI scan before and after the 12-month study. Results revealed an average five per cent increase in mass and three per cent increase in volume of the heart's right ventrical, even after accounting for variable factors like pre-existing conditions, diet or socioeconomic status. The study's author, Dr. Peter Leary, said the changes were enough to drastically increase the risk of heart disease and heart failure. 'Although the link between traffic-related air pollution and left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and cardiovascular death is established, the effects of traffic-related air pollution on the right ventricle have not been well studied,' he said. 'Using exposure to nitrogen dioxide as a surrogate for exposure to traffic-related air pollution, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that higher levels of exposure were associated with greater right ventricular mass and larger right ventricular end-diastolic volume. Greater right ventricular mass is also associated with increased risk for heart failure and cardiovascular death.' Pollutants can cause the heart's right ventricle to grow, increasing the risk of heart disease or cardiac arrest . While researchers can't categorically confirm that exposure to car pollutants caused the heart's mass to increase, Dr Leary said his study added more evidence to the connection between traffic jams and heart disease. 'The changes in the right ventricle of the heart that we found with increased exposure to nitrogen dioxide add to the body of evidence supporting a connection between traffic-related air pollution and cardiovascular disease,' he said. 'The many adverse effects of air pollution on human health support continued efforts to reduce this burden.'","University study links traffic pollutants to an increase in the heart's mass .

Health officials said that there have been ‘widespread’ increases in the number of cases in England. During February there were significantly more cases of the bacterial illness than would normally be expected for this time of year, according to Public Health England (PHE). The number of cases of scarlet fever in England soared to a 24 year high in February this year . In the four weeks to February 23, health officials were notified of 868 cases of scarlet fever - over the last four years experts have noted an average of 444 cases. Officials said that the figure is at its highest for this time of year since 1990. The increase has been noted across England apart from in the North West. Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that causes a distinctive red rash. It is not common in the UK anymore and is usually mild. The characteristic symptom of the illness is a widespread red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch. Other symptoms include a high temperature, a flushed face and a red, swollen tongue. The illness usually follows a sore throat or a skin infection. It is extremely contagious and can be contracted by breathing in bacteria after someone has sneezed or coughed, by touching the skin of an infected person or by sharing contaminated towels, clothes or bed lined. Anybody can catch scarlet fever but it is most common in children aged two to eight. Source: NHS Choices . An interim report on the infection states: ‘Routine monitoring of surveillance data has identified widespread increases in scarlet fever notifications in February 2014, beyond those seasonally expected. These are the highest notification totals for this time of year since 1990.’ A PHE spokeswoman said that there are seasonal rises in scarlet fever between December and April each year. Every few years there is also a notable increase in the number of cases and the latest bout of infections is likely to be part of that cycle, she added. The organisation has warned health officials to be ‘mindful’ of the current rise in figures when treating patients. The most noticeable symptom of scarlet fever is a distinctive pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch. Other symptoms include a high temperature, a flushed face and a red, swollen tongue. It is ‘extremely contagious’ and can be caught by breathing in bacteria from an infected person's coughs and sneezes, touching the skin of a person with a streptococcal skin infection and sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen.

There has been an increase in the number of scarlet fever cases everywhere in England except for in the North West. Image shows the bacteria that causes scarlet fever . ‘Between 12 to 48 hours after this, a characteristic rash develops. Cases are more common in children although adults can also develop scarlet fever. ‘Symptoms usually clear up after a week and in the majority of cases remain reasonably mild providing a course of antibiotics is completed to reduce the risk of complications. ‘Children or adults diagnosed with scarlet fever are advised to stay at home until at least 24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment to avoid passing on the infection. ‘We will continue to closely monitor these increases and work with healthcare professionals to try and halt the spread of infection.’","There has been a 'widespread' increase in the number of cases .

From the tiger to the orangutan, Indonesia is home to some of the world’s most threatened animals. And now the country’s highest Islamic body has issued a fatwa declaring that the hunting and trading of endangered species is immoral. While many people might associate fatwas with death threats, after the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a threat against Salman Rushdie for his novel The Satanic Verses, a fatwa is simply a call to action – in this case, to save animals from extinction. Indonesia's highest Islamic body has issued a fatwa declaring that the hunting and trading of endangered species such as the sumatran tiger (pictured) is immoral . Java rhinoceros' are critically endangered and are already extinct in other countries including China and India after being hunted in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Sumatran tiger is another animal threatened with extinction in the country. 93 per cent of all tigers have disappeared over the past 100 years. Lar Gibbons face a bleak future as a result of deforestation and people's taste for their meat. They are also captured to be kept as pets. There are big efforts to protect remaining orangutans but in the past they have been kept as pets and traded when they were young, which often involved the killing of their mothers. Habitat loss for pall oil plantations has also led to their decline in numbers. Hayu Susilo Prabowo, a member of the Indonesian Council of Clerics, said the edict was developed in consultation with environmental activists and academics affiliated with the National University in Jakarta. While council edicts have no legal weight, the announcement shows the impact of conservation efforts in the country. The fatwa is aimed at encouraging people to protect the environment, including endangered animals such as rhinos and elephants that also live in the country, said Mr Prabowo, head of the council's environment and natural resources committee. Fatwa is aimed at encouraging people to protect the environment, including endangered animals such as rhinos and elephants that also live in the country, according to the head of the council's environment and natural resources committee. Here, a group of activists in Indonesia rally for the conservation of sumatran tigers . The Indonesian Council of Clerics is not the first religious body to get involved in the protection of animals. In 2005 the Dalai Lama called upon his followers to end trafficking. South Africa's Nazareth Baptist (Shembe) Church, a traditional Zulu church, has recently begun to use fake leopard skins in its ceremonies to protect the real creatures living nearby. The trip to Sumatra for Muslim leaders in September last year, organised by Indonesia's Universitas Nasional (UNAS), WWF-Indonesia and the U.K.-based Alliance of Religions and Conservation, is thought to have inspired the fatwa. It is thought to be the first of its kind in the world. Leaders talked with villagers about how they live side-by-side with elephants and tigers, after some locals asked about the status in Islam of the endangered animals. ‘They are creations of Allah, as we are. It is haram to kill them, and keeping them alive is part of the worship of God,’ the leaders reportedly said. ‘We want to make people aware that . damaging the environment is immoral and killing endangered species . violates Islamic teachings. Animals have to be protected, either at zoos . or in the wild,’ he said. The edict means that the moving or killing of endangered animals is 'haram' or forbidden and there is a chance that the message could resonate strongly with people living in Indonesia, which has the world’s largest Muslim population. 'People can escape government regulation, but they cannot escape the word of God,' Mr Prabowo told National Geographic. The fatwa also urges the government to review the licenses of palm oil plantations, which damage natural habitats and make life even harder for many endangered species. WWF Indonesia and other conservation groups worked with forestry ministry officials and the council on the edict, which will be officially announced on March 12 at Jakarta's Ragunan Zoo. The move comes at a time when trading of endangered animals across borders has reached record levels.

Twitter has officially banned pornographic images on its Vine app. It announced the changes on Thursday and the new rules come into effect immediately . It may have taken years of campaigning and complaints but Twitter has finally banned pornographic images on its Vine app. The Californian-based firm, which bought the video sharing app in 2012, announced the changes on Thursday and the new rules come into effect immediately. Within days of the app's official launch in January 2013, sexually explicit and pornographic clips began to appear and Twitter has been heavily criticised for not enforcing this ban sooner. The new rules do come with a series of caveats, however. For example, nudity will be allowed in documentary style clips, if it forms part of an artwork or sculpture, or if it is used for educational purposes. Breastfeeding clips are also allowed. Elsewhere, sexually suggestive content is also allowed, such as suggestive dancing, as long as the people in the clip are clothed - although close-ups of aroused genitals underneath clothing are banned. The new rules forbid any video of sex acts, sex toys used during sex acts, and sexually graphic animations. 'For more than 99 percent of our users, this doesn’t really change anything, ' explained a Vine spokesman. 'For the rest: we don’t have a problem with explicit sexual content on the internet - we just prefer not to be the source of it.' Any user that violates this new policy faces being suspended and will only be able to have their account restored once they have removed any offending posts. Twitter had to apologise weeks after the app's official launch when an explicit clip was made an Editor's Pick. Under the new rules, severe or repeated violations of the policy may result in permanent suspension. Users who believe their account has been suspended by mistake can appeal . Vine defines explicit sexual content as any content that 'includes depictions of sex acts, nudity that is sexually provocative or in a sexual context, and graphic depictions of sexual arousal.' What is okay to post? Vine allows depictions of nudity or partial nudity that are primarily documentary, educational or artistic in nature. This includes: Nudity in a documentary context, for example, videos of nude protestors. Nudity in an artistic context, for example, nude modeling in an art class. Nudity that is not sexually provocative, for example, a mother breastfeeding her child. Clothed sexually suggestive dancing. What is not okay to post? Sex acts, whether alone or with another person, as well as use of sex toys for sex acts. Sexually provocative nudity, for example, posts that focus on exposed genitalia or depict nudity in a context or setting that is sexually provocative - such as a strip club. Close-ups of aroused genitals underneath clothing. Art or animation that is sexually graphic . Source: Twitter Help Centre . Severe or repeated violation of the policy may result in permanent suspension. Users who believe their account has been suspended by mistake can also appeal. Other users can report clips that violate the policy to Twitter for it to investigate. The site is also going to go back through previous posts. 'We're notifying users who have posted . explicit sexual content in the past that they have a period to either . take down or download their existing content using a new tool we've . created,' continued the Vine spokesman. The original minimum age for Vine was set at 12-years-old, but this was raised to 17 shortly after the app was launched, in part because of the high level of explicit content on the site. Twitter also had to apologise weeks after the official launch when an explicit clip was made an Editor's Pick. The site claimed the video appeared at the top of the homepage due to a 'human error' but had refused to take down such pornographic videos because it didn't want to censor its users. During yesterday's new policy announcement, Vine said: 'We introduced Vine to make it easier for people to find, watch, create and share videos right from their mobile phones. 'As we’ve watched the community and your creativity grow and evolve, we’ve found that there’s a very small percentage of videos that are not a good fit for our community.

Mandy Ewington was strolling along the sea shore when she saw two bones poking out of the cliff face . The bones are thought to have belonged to a monk in the 9th Century. Pictured is King Alfred surrounded by monks in the 800s . Coastal archaeologist Karl-James Langford said the find was 'quite an easy picture to put together.' The bones were found in Monknash, South Wales, which was a burial ground for Cistercian monks in the Middle Ages.

'There was a monastic community close to the area and these bones indicate a male in their late 20s who was in good health. 'I would say they belong to a monk from the 1200s - due to previous archaeological digs in the past, the depth of the bones in the cliff and the history of the area. 'He would likely be buried with nothing except two shroud rings which would have held his burial shroud in place at the head and feet. 'It's quite an easy picture to put together. 'The valley is named after the Welsh saint Cewydd and was home to a community of Cistercian Monks from 1129 until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1535. Mr Langford, who runs Archaeology Cymru, said the winter storms had caused huge swathes of the British coastline to collapse and precious archaeological sites were being revealed and lost to the sea. Mr Langford added: 'It's like watching archaeology going like the pages of a book and the history is being revealed with every turn of the page. 'But unfortunately nobody can touch or excavate these bones because they are in such a dangerous position.' Storms have caused huge swathes of the British coastline to collapse with archaeological sites rapidly being revealed and lost to the sea. The arrow shows where the bones are located in the cliff . Monknash is named after the Welsh saint Cewydd and was home to a community of Cistercian Monks from 1129 until the dissolution of the monasteries 1535 . The bones, uncovered in Monknash, in the Vale of Glamorgan, belong to a male in his late 20s . Human bones were discovered in the area in 1982, when a human long-bone was found, and then in 1990 part of a human skull was picked up. Three years later, excavations revealed three adults buried in an east-west line. The Cwm Nash Burial Ground is listed by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales as an 'unofficial burial ground used by parishioners of Monknash'. A 2012 report by the Glamorgan Gwent Archaeological Trust concluded that the burials found on cliffs at Cwm Nash probably date from some time in the post-medieval period (1485-1901). Mr Langford said the recent winter storms had caused massive coastal erosion around the British coastline and archaeologists couldn't keep speed with the number of sites being lost to the sea. He said: 'In just a couple of weeks of storms we lost a foot of our coastline. Pictured here is coastal archaeologist Karl-James Langford who has been studying the remains. Mr Langford said: 'It's like watching archaeology going like the pages of a book and the history is being revealed with every turn of the page' 'If you put that into perspective - over the last 2,000 years we have lost about 1km of the coast line. 'Erosion is accelerating so fast we can do nothing about it. 'We are losing burial grounds, hill forts and whole settlements all washed into the sea. 'But archaeologists cannot do the work on these sites and excavate them because they are so dangerous - they are on the edge of a sea cliff. 'I take my students to Orkney every year and we are being told by the archaeologists up there that they are losing sites so fast they cannot excavate and document them quick enough. 'On the east coast around Norfolk the erosion has been going since time immemorial and now we are getting erosion on the west coast. 'There are hill forts along South Wales which will not exist in 10 years time as the cliffs will be completely gone.'","Thigh bones are being revealed as the cliffs are eroded away in Monknash .

The peregrine falcon is the fastest member of the animal kingdom and is renowned for its speedy hunting swoop, which it uses to catch prey. While the birds are much admired, exactly how they achieve speeds of 200mph and precision when diving has remained a mystery. But now a team of German scientists have studied the falcons using a series of cameras to investigate the birds’ aerodynamics, and have discovered that their feathers 'pop up' to reduce drag. Scroll down for video . A team of Garman scientists have studied peregrine falcons using a series of cameras to investigate the birds' aerodynamics. They snapped the birds during different points of their dives down the side of a 200ft dam (pictured) The peregrine falcon - or duck hawk - is renowned for its speed, reaching more than 200mph (322kph) during its hunting swoop. It is the fastest member of the animal kingdom. The fastest swoop ever measured was 242mph (389kh) according to National Geographic. The bird can be found everywhere on the planet except for extreme polar regions, very high mountains and tropical rainforests, making it the world's most widespread raptor. Peregrine falcons eat medium-sized birds which they usually catch in flight. They typically measure between 12.5in (34cm) to 22in (58cm) in length, with females being up to a third larger than males. The birds catch prey by diving from a height at blistering speeds of up to 200mph (322kph), making it hard for scientists to see exactly what is going on. To solve this, researchers from the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology and the universities of Bonn and Giessen, trained a small number of falcons to dive from the top of a dam to the bottom to retrieve a treat. They did this so they could follow the birds' flight over a predictable path, making it easy to map, according to the study published in the Plos One journal. High speed cameras focused on different parts of the dam wall - which measured 200ft (60metres) tall - filmed the birds from different angles and the scientists used the footage to work out the bird’s diving trajectory. By analysing the data and videos of the birds in flight, the scientists discovered that small feathers (circled) pop up between the birds' wings to boost its aerodynamics at its top speed during the dives and keep air flowing smoothly over its body. The picture on the left is an image of oil paint showing wind flow lines on a plastic bird model . This is almost impossible as there are no markers or reference points when filming the birds in the wild. Armed with data, the researchers created a 3D plastic model of a peregrine falcon as if it was diving at full speed and analysed it in a wind tunnel. They looked at the flow of air over the model's surface by applying a thin layer of oil paint to the model and examining the streaking patterns left behind, which gave them an idea of wind flow lines. Peregrine falcons (pictured) are the fastest animals in the world. They were once endangered in the U.S. but the population has made a comeback after the ban of DDT and other pesticides in the 1970s . They also tracked the movement of tiny particles illuminated with a laser in the wind tunnel, to see how they travelled over the surface of the bird, according to Plos Blogs. By analysing the data and videos of the birds in flight, the scientists discovered that small feathers pop up between the birds’ wings on its back to boost its aerodynamics at its top speed during the dives and keep air flowing smoothly over its body. The pop-up feathers reduce drag and can be linkened to the flaps on an aeroplane’s wing, or even an aerofoil on a sports car. The researchers  found that the typical shape of the birds' bodies and wings at maximum diving speed in the experiment made a V-shape. They used this shape to make a 3D model (pictured bottom) to analyse in a wind tunnel . ‘High-resolution pictures of the diving peregrine indicate that feathers pop-up in the equivalent regions, where flow separation in the model falcon occurred,’ the scientists wrote in their paper. They also found that the typical shape of the birds’ bodies and their wings at maximum diving speed in the experiment made a V-shape. ‘The leading edge of the wing is not straight but has a wavy structure with grooves in the gaps between the neck and both shoulders,’ according to the study. Peregrine falcons were once endangered in the U.S. but the population has made a comeback after the ban of DDT and other pesticides in the 1970s. This is the 3D flight path of the falcon, which is color-coded to show how fast it travels during different parts of its dive. Red colours denote the fastest part of its dive, with deep blue being the slowest.

Astronauts are often thought to be superhuman, defying death every day while they hurtle around Earth at 17,500 miles per hour . In reality, however, the day to day life of an astronaut on board the ISS can, for long stretches, be mind-numbingly dull. From reporting food packaging mistakes to tackling problems of urinating, what occupies an astronauts mind is often less exciting than you might think. Karen Nyberg, an American mechanical engineer and Nasa astronaut, does some sewing while onboard the ISS . Anonymous journal entries, released by Nasa, have been described as similar to 'gossip columns' rather than the serious issues discussed in Star Trek’s Captain’s Log. One of the clearest topics that occupied the minds of those on board the ISS were frustrations with everyday tasks. ‘It was a frustrating day,’ wrote one astronaut. ‘The urine collection started disastrously first thing this morning. ‘I think I got about 75 per cent in the bag; the rest was all over me. Not a good way to start the day.’ Chris Hadfield, the former commander on the ISS, pictured playing with water and the lack of gravity . 'Interesting, how you can be on top of the world one moment (literally) and then be completely demoralised the next, because of what is said on the ground.' 'Sunday is meant to be a day of rest, but somehow Houston managed to make it feel like Monday.' 'I was awakened in the middle of the . night by the ground telling me to close the shutter on the lab window. It is beyond me why it couldn't wait until wake-up time.' An analysis by journalist Aviva Rutkin of New Scientist identified several major themes from these entries, including complaints about Houston, an obsession with food and homesickness. But what really stuck out was the banality of day to day activities. ‘One . last funny story – during the first month of our stay, I noted that the . labelling on two types of food packets were backwards,’ said one . entry. ‘Today I wanted . chicken teriyaki. So, I gambled that the labelling problem had not fixed . for the new batch of food that came up recently, and selected “Beef . Tips with Mushrooms”.' ‘I was rewarded for not having overestimated Nasa! The chicken was in the packages labelled beef.’ The crew writings, however, were more than just an exercise in maintaining a diary of daily thoughts and events. By looking at their entries, researchers were able to gain insights into the mental and emotional well-being of the astronauts. 'It comes out looking like a gossip column, I'm sure,' said astronaut Sunita Williams before she arrived at the space station. 'But the point is to identify characteristics that will make expeditions successful.' Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin gives Nasa astronaut Michael Hopkins a hair trim on board the ISS . Jack Stuster of Anacapa Sciences in Santa Barbara, California, was the first to suggest astronauts keep a diary as part of a scientific experiment. He was inspired by the logs and journals of polar explorers and diaries from occupants in the South Indian Ocean and in Antarctica. ‘Studying small groups living and working in isolation and confinement is much like studying social issues with a microscope,’ said Professor Stuster. ‘There is much that can be learned from the approach that is relevant to nearly all human experience.’ It also proved to be a cathartic experience for many of the astronauts on board. Anonymous journal entries, released by Nasa, have shown how they read more like gossip columns than Star Trek's Captain's Log . ‘With time on my hands for half an hour, I feel slightly melancholy, for some reason,’ one astronaut wrote. ‘This happens quite often in space, among astronauts in general (and cosmonauts), and space seems to somehow amplify our emotions, positive or negative, however they might be. ‘Maybe it is the remoteness, or the beautiful scene outside, or a consciousness that we are in a unique situation, benefiting from the work of others.’ The thoughts and experiences contained in the writings remained anonymous; only the individual keeping the journal and the investigator had access to the documents. But while they may reveal the banality of life on the ISS, they also highlight its incredible beauty. ‘I think I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to understand what I saw here every day for six months,’ wrote one astronaut. ‘The view is awe-inspiring and beyond comprehension.’ The concept of a 'day' aboard an orbiting spacecraft is a abstract: every 24 hours, astronauts on board the ISS will experience 15 dawns as the station speeds around the world. In a blog post while he was onboard the ISS< astronaut Don Pettit addressed the topic of timekeeping and the . challenge of balance. 'When humans venture into a harsh wilderness, the fraction of time on . task shrinks, while the effort to simply be there grows,' said Pettit. 'You are lucky to log six hours of mission tasking and six hours of . sleep. The rest of the time is spent simply trying to stay alive.' When there are no immediate dangers, the crew focuses on scheduled . workloads and daily routines. The breakdown may vary from day-to-day, . but in general includes a 1-hour meeting with mission control, a 12-hour . workday, a second 1-hour mission control tag up, and an hour to . finalise tasks before dinner. S . leep and personal time fall within the . remainder of the 24-hour day. Within the 12-hour working day, there is a further breakdown of tasks. In general, this comes to 6.5 hours on primary mission tasks, such as . research, operations, and maintenance. The crew members also spend 2.5 . hours on physical training for both research goals and their own health. What time remains is quickly consumed by preparations for the primary . tasks, unplanned repairs, and general upkeep to maintain smooth . conditions throughout the mission.","Themes that emerged include frustration with daily tasks and missing Earth .

The ruthless, bloody and lonely lives of gladiators have been revealed in a remarkable reconstruction of one of their Austrian training grounds. Discovered at the site of Carnuntum outside Vienna, the gladiator school is the first one to be uncovered outside the city of Rome. Now hidden beneath a field, the school has been entirely mapped using non-invasive techniques such as aerial surveys and ground-penetrating radar. Archaeologists have mapped an ancient gladiator school, where the famed warriors lived, trained, and fought. The reconstruction reveals details about their ruthless, bloody and lonely lives . The discovery, reported by the journal Antiquity, reveals intricate details about the daily routine of these famous warriors during the second century A.D. The so-called ludus ‘is on a scale to rival the famous ludus magnus, the gladiatorial school behind the Coliseum in Rome,’ the archaeologists, led by Ludwig Boltzmann Institute, said in a statement. It is thought at least 80 gladiators lived at the school, separated from the town of Carnuntum, which was founded on the Danube River. The school had heated floors for winter training, baths, infirmaries, plumbing, as well as a graveyard close by. Gladiators trained every day for public fights in an amphitheatre . Excavations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries revealed many elements of the Carnuntum complex including a legionary fortress and town, but the training school was only discovered in 2011 . At least 80 gladiators lived at the training school, separated from the town of Carnuntum. They slept in 32-square-foot (3-square-metre) cells, usually in isolation, and sometimes with a roommate. They operated alone rather than in teams. The details contradict the popular view of gladiators as traveling around the country for fights, as seen in the movie Gladiator. The fighters were often convicted criminals, prisoners-of-war, and usually slaves. Researchers believes the training area was where the men's 'market value and in end effect their fate' was decided. If they were successful, they had a chance to  advance to 'superstar' status - and maybe even achieve freedom. Similar to a fortress prison, they slept in 32-square-foot (3-square-metre) cells, usually in isolation, and sometimes with a roommate. The school had heated floors for winter training, baths, infirmaries, plumbing, as well as a graveyard close by. Gladiators trained every day for public fights in an amphitheatre. Imaging equipment showed the structures still to be excavated as having the similar building hallmarks to the Collisseum and the Ludus Magnus gladiatorial ampitheatre, both in Rome. The details contradict the popular view of gladiators as travelling around the country for fights, as seen in the film Gladiator. The resulting archaeological maps and plans of individual buildings, streets and Roman infrastructure allow the virtual reconstruction of the city layout and the development of ancient land - and townscapes in two and three dimensions,’ said the team from Austria, Belgium and Germany. Discovered at the site of Carnuntum outside Vienna, the gladiator school is the first one to be uncovered outside the city of Rome . A computer image shows the Roman gladiator school discovered by underground radar outside Vienna . In Carnuntum, one of the largest Roman landscapes that has been preserved to the present day, a new motorised multi-channel ground penetrating radar device was used to see the hidden structure beneath the ground . ‘Although some 100 ludi are thought to have existed in the Roman Empire, almost all have been destroyed or built over’. Excavations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries revealed many elements of the Carnuntum complex including a legionary fortress and town, but the ludus was only discovered in 2011. A spokesman for the Roemisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, one of the institutes involved in finding and evaluating the discovery said: 'A gladiator school was a mixture of a barracks and a prison, kind of a high-security facility. The school was a mixture of a barracks and a prison, according to a spokesperson for the complex . The details contradict the popular view of gladiators as traveling around the country for fights, as seen in the movie Gladiator . 'The fighters were often convicted criminals, prisoners-of-war, and usually slaves.' The main courtyard is ringed by living quarters and other buildings and contains a round, 19-square metre training area - a small stadium overlooked by wooden seats and the terrace of the chief trainer. The institute believes the training area was where the men's 'market value and in end effect their fate' was decided. Carnuntum park head Franz Hume added: 'If they were successful, they had a chance to  advance to 'superstar' status - and maybe even achieve freedom.' Gladiators took their name from the Latin word gladius, for sword. Some were volunteers who risked their legal and social standing and their lives by appearing in the arena. Gladiators were often convicted criminals, prisoners-of-war or slaves. They lived on a high-energy, vegetarian diet combining barley, boiled beans, oatmeal, ash believed to help fortify the body . Most were slaves, schooled under harsh conditions and socially marginalised. Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered audiences an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world. The games reached their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD, and they persisted not only throughout the social and economic crises of the declining Roman state but even after Christianity became the official religion in the 4th century AD. Christian emperors continued to sponsor such entertainments until at least the late 5th century AD, when the last known gladiator games took place. The international team now plan to continue mapping efforts at Carnuntum, to reveal even more details about the brutal lives of these ancient warriors.

After years of being overweight, grandmother Marcia Thomas, 53, from East Grinstead, was thrilled when she managed to shed 7st courtesy of a healthy diet and plenty of exercise. But despite spending hours in the gym trying to tone her upper arms, they remained stubbornly flabby. At her wits end, Marcia decided to pay for surgery in Belgium to remove the unsightly bingo wings - and was left devastated when she discovered that not only had the bungling surgeon failed to remove any flab; he'd left her arms badly scarred to boot. Not right: Marcia was horrified to discover that no fat had been removed following her Â£3,500 surgery . Now she has spoken out about her experience of surgery abroad and says she wishes she had never been tempted by the cut-price deals available. 'I'm really angry with the surgeon and I . wish I hadn't had the surgery,' she admits. 'I can't even bear to look at my arms - I . feel like a freak!' Marcia's story began when she decided to break the habit of a lifetime and embrace healthy eating in a bid to lose weight. Originally tipping the scales at a hefty 16st, she slowly but surely managed to lose seven through diet and exercise and says she was thrilled with the results. 'I felt great for it - I looked good as well,' she reveals. 'My clothes looked good on me and the only downside of it was the skin on my arms.' Weighty problem: Marcia once tipped the scales at 16st (seen here) but lost 7st by eating well and exercising . Ouch: She had surgery to remove pouches of skin left after weight loss but was upset to find them still there . While the rest of her had become taut and toned, the skin on her arms had stretched and lost elasticity, leaving her with pouches of wobbly skin. ''I'd always have to buy a size larger in jackets just so my arms could fit in,' she remembers. 'I wanted to feel feminine and I wanted to look feminine.' Convinced that no amount of gym-going would fix the problem, she travelled to the Belgian capital Brussels for surgery to remove her bingo wings at a cost of Â£3,500. 'It was a very, very nice clinic,' she remembers. 'The . doctor told me what he was going to do and said he was used to working . on women of colour so I felt really calm.' When she emerged from surgery, she was horrified by the results. 'I had the scarring to prove that I'd . had this surgery but the actual size of my arms still looked the same,' she reveals. 'I . was told by the surgeon that that was normal and I wouldn't see any . difference for a few weeks.' Relief: Marcia has since had further surgery which saw medics remove a whopping 250g of fat from her arms . Four months later, she was still waiting to see results - much to the horror of British consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon, Peter Arnstein. 'She has had no recourse to further . opinion and back-up on her trip to Belgium and for me, that's just . unforgiveable,' he says. 'For a patient to be left adrift is just unacceptable.' Dr Arnstein has since helped Marcia put her botched body right, courtesy of a two-hour operation which involved removing 250g of fat - all of which should have already been removed by the bungling Belgian doctor. Speaking after the surgery, a thrilled Marcia said it had helped her regain some of the confidence lost as a result of the botched surgery.

The ancient animal was discovered in July 2011 in a remote part of Russia, but scientists are now performing an autopsy in the hope that vital scientific information about the extinction of some bison species around 9,000 years ago will be revealed. The autopsy is thought to be the first in the world on such an old bison and scientists will now look for parasites that might have plagued the animals. The 9,000-year-old bison (pictured) was discovered in July 2011 in a remote part of Russia, but scientists are now performing an autopsy in the hope that vital scientific information about the dying out of the bison around 9,000 years ago will be revealed . The autopsy on the Yakutia specimen is the first in on the world on such an old bison. Scientists from a number of Russian and U.S. institutions are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy. This involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites. Histology samples – those showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - are thought to prove the most interesting, as scientists will be able to  study parasites attached to ancient bison for the first time. Researchers hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison's digestive organs and to publish their research next year. The creature was found perfectly preserved in July 2011 in the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, on the shore of a lake in the north of Ust-Yana district, where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found. Its body became visible after part of the shore collapsed into the water. 'The discovery has an enormous value for scientists since it is the best preserved bison ever found,’ said Albert Protopopov, chief of the Mammoth Fauna Research Department of the Yakutian Academy of Sciences. He told The Siberian Times: ‘We have ascertained that the bison lived 9,000 years ago, at the very beginning of the Holocene epoch and died aged approximately four. 'By that time, many mammoths had died here, but the bison still lived.’ Scientists from a number of Russian and U.S. institutions are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy, which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites . The period began between 9,000 to 12,000 years ago at the close of the Ice Age. Earth began to warm and tundra became forest. Very large animals that had adapted to extreme cold like the woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros became extinct - although woolly mammoths may have lived side-by side bison in parts of Russia for a short time. Humans began to hunt smaller animals. One species, Bison priscus to which the bison undergoing autopsy might belong, lived in western Europe, central Asia and later in north America before dying out for an unknown reason. 'The careful and thorough examination we have begun will give us answers to many questions, first of all as to why did the bison die out'. Scientists from the Yakutian Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Geology of Diamond and Precious Metals, Yakutsk Agricultural Research Institute and the Agricultural Academy of Yakutsk are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy, which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites. They are joined by the Russian Academy of Sciences and Mammoth Research Centre experts from the U.S. to assist Innokenty Pavlov, a taxidermist from the Joint Museum of History and Culture of the Peoples of the North, who is leading the autopsy.

He said that histology samples – the samples showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - will prove the most interesting, as they will be the first chance scientists have to studying parasites attached to ancient bison. ‘Perhaps they didn't preserve, but we will find their DNA and the traces of their activity,’ he said. ‘By performing biochemical tests and then comparing them by identical tests of currently living worms we will be able to find out what kind of parasites lived 9,000 years ago. 'This will be done thanks to a new technology aimed at studying invertebrates' DNA.

The number of fines issued to parents taking their children on holiday during school term-time has soared by more than 70 per cent. Nearly 5,300 penalties were handed to families by 34 councils across England during last year's autumn term, according to new research by the BBC. It marks a 74 per cent increase from the autumn term in 2012, indicating more parents are willing to face a fine in order to save cash when booking a family holiday. Family holiday: There have been an increase in the number of fines issued to parents for term-time breaks . Why can't you take your child on holiday in term time?Many schools used to give pupils authorised absences of up to ten days during term time.But in September Education Secretary Michael Gove banned the allowance in all but ‘exceptional circumstances’. A maximum fine of £60 per pupil per parent can now be charged, rising to £120 if not paid within seven days. Refusal to pay can mean a fine of up to £2,500 and up to three years in jail. Why do holiday firms increase prices?Travel . companies insist they are responding to demand. They make more money . when demand peaks in the six-week summer holiday, which offsets smaller . margins in low season. They claim they trying to cap charges during school holidays will push up prices year round. The huge rise comes after tougher regulations on term-time holidays were introduced by the government last September, prompting a debate in parliament over fears travel companies were 'cashing in' by putting up prices during school breaks due to increased demand. A family holiday during half-terms can be twice as expensive as the week before. However, since September 1, 2013, schools have been stopped from allowing children 10 days of leave a year for family breaks in 'special circumstances'. Now, requests for term-time holidays are at the head teacher's discretion. The new research, carried out by BBC Breakfast, found only six out of 34 local authorities that responded to its questions had not fined any parents, while two had seen a decrease in the number of penalties issued, and 26 reported an increase. Overall, the average rise for fines issued to parents in the autumn term 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was 74 per cent. And Liverpool City Council noted the biggest rise - up from 97 in 2012 to 250 last year. Council spokesman Ron Collinson said the interests of the child have to come first. 'You save a lot of money, but you pay the cost at the other end in terms of your child's schooling,' he said. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent. 'That is why we have given schools more power to tackle poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier. We are giving all schools the autonomy to set their own term dates. 'We want to see more parents asking schools to consider changes to term and holiday dates that will work for pupils and their families.'","New figures indicate a 74% rise in fines from autumn term 2012-2013 .

A Mississippi grandfather who woke up in a body bag as he was lifted on to an embalmer's table two weeks ago has died at home. Walter Williams had mistakenly been declared dead after suffering from heart failure at a hospice on February 26. But thanks to his unexpected recovery, the 78-year-old's family got to spend two more weeks with him before he passed away at home at 1am Thursday. Second chance: Walter Williams was rushed to hospital last month after waking up in a body bag. The 78-year-old died on Thursday . 'God gave us a little more time with him, and we're happy about that,' his daughter, Mary Williams, said. Eddie Hester, his nephew who had been at the hospice when Mr Williams was zipped into a body bag, added: 'I think he's gone this time.' The story of Mr Williams' recovery last month went viral, after staff at Porter and Sons Funeral . Homes noticed the elderly man's leg moving as they prepared to embalm . him. The father-of-11, who has 15 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, had been declared dead by a coroner when neither he or medical staff could find a pulse. 'After they got through checking him, the coroner, they pronounced him dead and put him in a plastic bag, zipped him up and took him, put him in the hearse and they left,' Mr Hester said. He told 16 WAPT News: 'That was at 10:30pm, and at 2:30am, my cousin called me and said ""Not yet"" and I said ""what do you mean not yet?"" He said, ""Daddy still here"".' Shock: Walter Williams had been taken to this funeral home when staff noticed he was moving . Gone: Eddie Hester says his uncle has finally died two weeks after mistakenly being declared dead . Mr Williams' daughter, Martha Lewis, added: 'The mortician said something wasn't right. His leg started moving.' The 78-year-old was rushed to hospital and then allowed to return home a few days later. Doctors believe a combination of medicine he had been given may have made it appear that his vital signs were unresponsive. His family suggested that Mr Williams' pacemaker may have stopped working and then restarted. Two weeks after his recovery, which the coroner described as a miracle, Mr Williams died at his home. The cause of death has not been released.","Walter Williams was sent to a funeral parlor last month after hospice staff couldn't find a pulse .

A first-time mother who says she failed a drug test while in labor because she ate poppy seeds has sued a Pittsburgh hospital, claiming officials defamed her and violated her doctor-patient confidentiality by sharing the results with a child welfare agency. Rachael Devore, 31, who gave birth at Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center on June 24, contends in her lawsuit that the hospital staff tested her urine while she was in labor and then turned over the 'positive' drug test to county caseworkers. 'I just delivered and it's supposed to be this beautiful, wonderful, happy time and I'm being accused of something that's completely ridiculous,' Devore said. 'To be accused of physically and purposely harming your child is a very tough accusation to swallow.' Furious: First-time mother Rachael Devore (pictured with baby Emmalyn) is suing the Pittsburgh hospital which claimed she tested positive for heroin during labor and shared the results with child welfare . A UPMC spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit filed Tuesday. Opiates like heroin are made from poppies, which is why the seeds can result in false positives on drug tests. But Devore said she didn't realize what prompted the failed drug test until weeks later - when she bought the same kind of bread she had eaten ate the day before she went into labor and saw poppy seeds when she sliced into it. Last year, another Pennsylvania woman settled a lawsuit with Jameson Hospital in New Castle for $143,500, after a county child welfare worker seized the woman's newborn in 2010 after that mother also tested positive for drugs after eating a poppy seed bagel. Devore's attorney, Margaret Coleman, said there were no medical reasons to test Devore for drugs, saying she was a 'model' patient. Revelation: Devore said she realized weeks after her drug test that it was the poppy seeds in bread she'd eaten before labor which caused the false test . Frightening: Rachael Devore, 31 (right) was allegedly told that she would have to surrender her parental rights to her husband (left) if she did drugs again . And when the urine sample came back as . an 'unconfirmed positive' the results even included the disclaimer, . 'These results are to be used only for medical purposes. Unconfirmed . screening results must not be used for non-medical purposes (e.g. employment testing, legal testing),' the lawsuit stated. Except . that's exactly what UPMC did, Devore claims, when they referred her . case to Allegheny County's Office of Children, Youth and Families. Within hours of her daughter's birth, a nurse took a urine sample from the child who was monitored for withdrawal symptoms. The next day, a hospital social worker interrupted Devore while breastfeeding 'and demanded information about her alleged drug use'. Devore told the social worker she didn't use drugs and, although their daughter's tests were also negative, the hospital social worker still referred the case to CYF as Devore and the baby were being discharged June 26. Lawsuit: Devore is suing Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh (pictured) for allegedly drug-testing her without consent and sharing the false results with child services . A CYF caseworker visited the Devores . later that day, and scheduled a July 5 inspection of their home. A CYF . investigator referred the case to a drug addiction counselor and . required Devore to sign a 'safety plan' acknowledging she'd surrender . her parental rights to her husband if she did drugs again. CYF workers inspected the home repeatedly in the coming weeks, and the drug counselor told Devore she planned to recommend future random drug tests, even after Devore passed another urine test. Eventually, the CYF investigator opted not to require the drug tests, though the agency has yet to send Devore a letter confirming her case has been closed. The agency doesn't comment publicly on child welfare cases. 'The Devores are very, very fortunate that CYF didn't take their baby away and UPMC knows that risk exists whenever they make one of these reports,' Coleman said.

Winter-weary residents in Chicago and the Midwest had to get out the snow shovels and trudge to work through snow after another storm hit this morning. Most of the U.S. had been enjoying what appeared to be the start of spring, with warmer temperatures over the weekend. But a storm moving eastwards dropped 6 inches of snow in Chicago, and caused flight cancellations and power cuts. Big freeze: After a few spring-like days, large parts of the U.S. have had a return to chillier temperatures and snow . No end: A pedestrian walks across a snowy parking lot in Pennsylvania on Wednesday after another winter storm hit . The blizzard is expected to move through the Great Lakes in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania before heading to upstate New York. Tens of thousands of homes and businesses in northern Illinois lost power this morning and a few hundred flights were canceled at Chicago's airports, including at Midway International. 'The roads were just horrible, it was pretty hazardous conditions out there,' Stephen Rodriguez, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Romeoville, Illinois, said. He said an initial forecast for 8 inches of snow in the city was overblown, but said the impact on the morning commute had been significant. Forecasters warned that as much as 9 inches of snow could fall in parts of southeastern Michigan, with 4 to 8 inches in Detroit. Winter returns: Snow falls over the White River in Indianapolis on Wednesday . Blizzards: The storm is heading East, with large snowfall forecast for Upstate New York . Before sunrise on Wednesday, snow and sleet were making roads slippery across a southern swath of the state. Hundreds of schools closed their doors for the day. The picture was similar in upstate New York, where hundreds of schools called off classes after the weather service warned that a blizzard with winds of up to 50mph could paralyze the area from western New York to the Adirondacks. Chicago had already been buried by 75.5 inches of snow this winter - the fourth most on record dating back to 1884-1885, according to the weather service. The snowfall on Wednesday pushed the seasonal total into third place, ahead of the 77 inch total from 1969-1970, though with some snow still falling Wednesday a final tally was not complete. 'It's going to be pretty hard going for people trying to get to work, especially in the side streets that haven't been treated,' Weather Channel meteorologist Kevin Roth said. 'Detroit has had a heavy season so I don't know how much salt they have left,' he told NBC News. After a few days of spring-like thawing, the return to snow-covered streets and trees was a jarring sight. A few hours before dawn, 40mph winds blotted out the lit-up skyline and left trees glazed with heavy snow. Grim start: Residents in Illinois faced a snowy trudge to walk after a storm hit on Wednesday morning . White out: A road sign is covered in Blue Island, Illinois, after 5in of snow fell . Struggle: Grocery carts are pushed across a snowy parking lot as much of Michigan woke up to a return of the wintry weather . Workers downtown grunted as they heaved slush with well-worn shovels. Others rushed to return sidewalk signs warning pedestrians of ice falling from skyscrapers. The shift in temperatures, from the 50s on Monday to back below freezing, caused some confusion. 'I had a guy in here yesterday asking for salt and right after him a guy wanted mulch. Only in Chicago,' Richard Schauer, owner of Schauer's Hardware in Forest Park, said. He did say there are still a few shovels, though the selection is pretty thin. Snowfall totals in southeastern Michigan could come close to breaking a 133-year-old record. The storm will likely move the Detroit area close to the seasonal snow total of 93.6 inches set in 1880-1881, according to the weather service. Looking up: As the week comes to an end, temperatures will slowly be rising . Rainy Indianapolis experienced a swift temperature drop of about 30 degrees, from 68 late Tuesday afternoon to 37 early Wednesday. In Missouri, temperatures that peaked in the high 70s and in St Louis as high as 83 degrees on Tuesday were replaced with high winds and temperatures in the low 30s Wednesday morning. Jeff Gatewood, who owns Allisonville Nursery in the Indianapolis suburb of Fishers, said the months of snow and cold had slowed down business, but in recent weeks customers had returned for house plants and cheery garden items. 'Everybody's got so much pent-up energy, it's going to make for a crazy spring,' Mr Gatewood said. 'Spring fever is really going to be pretty high this year. And we all know the weather's going to hiccup and do this a few times before it straightens out.'","Hundreds of flights out of Chicago cancelled and thousands of homes and businesses lose power .

Marlon Brando's famous fedora, worn by him in his role as Mafia kingpin Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's award winning film The Godfather, has emerged for sale for $100,000. Brando's portrayal of the Sicilian Mafia Don in the 1972 classic was one of the most celebrated performances of all time, winning him an Oscar for best actor. The film won three Oscars, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, ranking only second behind the Orson Wells movie Citizen Kane. Made from grey felt, the fedora was one of the important props that Brando used in the film, to make his character of Don Corleone, the head of a powerful Mafia family, as debonair as he was fearsome. The hat is made by famous manufacturer Stetson, a company ordinarily known for making cowboy style hats seen in other classic Hollywood movies like westerns. It has been given an estimated value of $50,000, but experts think that it will likely go for double that amount, when it is sold by a U.S. private collector in an internet auction. Laura Yntema, from Los Angeles-based auctioneers Nate D Sanders, said: 'Props from movies made in the 1970s, the golden age of modern cinema, . like the Godfather are very rare. 'Back then props weren't really held onto once filming was over and very few survived. 'Thankfully this hat, worn by Marlon Brando in his famous role as Vito Corleone, was one of the props that did. The iconic hat is in good shape, but will likely form part of somebody's personal film memorabilia collection . 'The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made and Vito Corleone is its best known character. 'This hat is probably in the top 25 movie props of all time and is hugely desirable.

The sequel, The Godfather Part II, was released in 1974 and saw Robert DeNiro play a young Vito Corleone, and won six Oscars including best picture and best director. The Godfather Part III was released 16 years later in 1990, completing the story of Vito's son Michael, played by Al Pacino, and his time as the head of the Corleone family, and was largely critically panned when it was released.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 15:40 EST, 12 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:59 EST, 13 March 2014 . Barack Obama is set to order the U.S. Department of Labor to tighten regulations that allow some companies to skirt overtime laws by declaring employees' jobs are 'executive' or 'professional' in nature. The president will do it by raising the earning threshold that salaried workers must reach before they can be asked to work longer hours without time-and-a-half compensation. It has been ten years since President George W. Bush last raised that threshold, from $250 per week to $455. But the increase failed to keep up with inflation, making the smaller number worth more in today's dollars than the larger one. And any move to adjust it upward again could cost jobs as employers scramble to write bigger paychecks with the same amount of money in human-resources budgets. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama is pushing for higher wages across the board -- including a new federal minimum wage -- and shopped at a GAP store in New York to highlight the company's wage-hiking efforts . Obama is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would direct the Labor Department to raise the salary threshold above which companies can avoid paying overtime wages . 'Due to years of neglect, one of the linchpins of the middle class, the overtime rules that establish the 40-hour workweek, have been eroded,' a White House official said Wednesday. 'As a result, millions of salaried workers have been left without the protections of overtime or sometimes even the minimum wage. For example, a convenience store manager or a fast food shift supervisor or an office worker may be expected to work 50 or 60 hours a week or more, making barely enough to keep a family out of poverty, and not receive a dime of overtime pay.' By shifting the overtime minimum-earning goalposts again, Democrats hope to identify another pocketbook issue that will encourage middle-class workers to vote for them in November. It also indicates that the White House is prepared to sacrifice long-term jobs in order to appease the remaining employed low-income voting bloc in the short term. That's because employers who must suddenly pay overtime rates for many employees will still have to work within the restrictions of their human resources budgets. One way to work around the problem will be for companies to lay off workers who earn more than the new threshold and replace them with lower-paid, lower-skilled employees. Another way might be to dismiss some workers and slow down future hiring increases so that capital can catch up with costs. In order for the Obama administration to increase the threshold to what a $250 weekly paycheck was worth in 1975, it would have to set the new minimum to $1,122.58 – a $28-per-hour rate equal to an annual salary of $58,374. The liberal Economic Policy Institute has proposed an increase to $984 a week, about 50,000 per year. That number would increase take-home pay for between 5 and 10 million people. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez (far L), who will be in charge of setting the new overtime-wage qualification threshold, has been part of Obama's speaking tour to push a nationwide minimum-wage hike . But it's unlikely the new bar will be set that high when the Labor Department issues draft regulations. Obama's move, expected Thursday, will merely start the process. California's and New York's governments recently re-set their thresholds at $640 and $600 per week, respectively. 'We need to fix the system so folks working hard are getting compensated fairly,' Cecilia Muñoz, the White House Domestic Policy Council director, told The New York Times. 'That’s why we are jump-starting this effort.' But Cato Institute senior fellow Daniel Mitchell countered that '[t]here’s no such thing as a free lunch.' 'If they push through something to make a certain class of workers more expensive, something will happen to adjust.'","The president will order the Labor Department to increase the salary threshold below which companies must pay workers extra for overtime .
The bar was last raised in 2004 during the George W. Bush administration, but has lagged far behind inflation .
If the White House restored the level to what it was worth in 1975, everyone earning less than $58,000 per year would qualify for overtime pay .
'There's no free lunch,' one analyst told the NY Times, warning that employers could cut some jobs to pay for the rising cost of others ."

Former All-Pro NFL safety Darren Sharper who’s been accused of sexually assaulting women in five different states was indicted in Arizona on Wednesday on charges he administered dangerous drugs to two Tempe women and sexually assaulted them in November. It was the latest development in a shockingly long succession of sexual assault investigations involving the 38-year-old Sharper in Louisiana, California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada. Sharper has only been formally charged with raping women in Los Angeles and now in Phoenix, but authorities suspect the former New Orleans Saint of raping nine women in total. Sickening: Former All-Pro NFL safety Darren Sharper is suspected of drugging and raping nine women across five U.S. states . Sharper is currently in custody in Los Angeles, where he has pleaded not guilty to seven rape and drug counts in connection with two alleged attacks in Hollywood. He had been freed on $1 million bail, but was tossed back behind bars when an arrest warrant was issued in the New Orleans case. Sharper was an analyst for the NFL until he was fired last week. The indictment Arizona has not yet been publicly released. A call to the county prosecutor's office, which runs grand jury investigations, wasn't immediately returned. Police reports indicate that two women accused Sharper of raping them at a Tempe apartment on Nov. 21. One of the women told police she suspected she had been drugged before she was attacked. Sharper’s Arizona attorney Skip Donau told USA Today that Sharper has a ‘prior relationship’ with one of the victims there. ‘I talked to Darren, and he vigorously denies the allegations,’ Donau said. ‘We're going to contest them vigorously, and we expect at the end of the process he'll be vindicated.’ Records show that Sharper is accused of largely the crimes in each state. He allegedly meets women socially, slips sedatives in their drinks and then rapes them as they lay unconscious. His attorneys maintain Sharper had only consensual sex with these women. Sharper, 38, has been officially charged in just California (he's pictured here in an LA courtroom on February 14) and now Arizona.

However, he was thrown back in jail after Arizona officially filed charges for his alleged sexual assault of two Tempe women in November . USA Today reports that in the investigation that ensued following the Arizona rapes, the drug Ambien was found on a drink cup. The police report indicates that Sharper accompanied two women to a Tempe apartment, then gave them cocktails he prepared. Bygone days: Sharper made it to the Super Bowl with the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers. He retired in 2010 and, until he was fired last week, became an analyst with the NFL network . One of the women passed out immediately, while the other fell ill after drinking the cocktail. The sick woman claims she excused herself to the bathroom then subsequently saw Sharper naked atop her unconscious friend. ‘She reported being concerned that the sexual act was not consensual because she did not know if (the other woman) was awake,’ reads the report.

The dutiful reply that was typed by Mr Barlerin stated: ‘Golden Shred Marmalade/ J. Robertson & Sons,/ Paisley./ is supplied here by Chivers Brothers, 13 King Street, Aberdeen’.

A Manhattan heiress has claimed the tanning salon worker she married tricked her out of $700,000 by saying gangsters were chasing him for gambling debts. Candice Feinberg Lalicata is suing the man she married in 2011, claiming that he used the money to buy lavish gifts for his girlfriend in New Jersey. Steven Lalicata, his alleged mistress Diana Fernandez, and a couple of their friends are named in a $10 million lawsuit that alleges that they conned Lalicata's new wife out of the money. Claims: Candice Feinberg, pictured at her wedding to Steven Lalicata, alleges her husband tricked her out of tens of thousands of dollars . According to court papers seen by the Daily News, the daughter of Herbert Feinberg, one of the creators of seamless panties, was led to believe her husband had gambling debts with an organized crime group. 'Through a series of coordinated . communications, they led her to believe physical well-being would be in . jeopardy if she did not make huge amounts of cash available to him on . short notice,' the  lawsuit claimed. The case alleges that rather than being in debt and danger, Lalicata 'was stealing the money to live a double life'. The couple had met in April 2010, when Lalicata was working at the Beach Bum Tanning Salon in Manhattan. Shortly after he started dating Ms Feinberg, a divorcee with a five-year-old son, Lalicata learned that she had just cashed in her trust fund. It was then that he allegedly started befriending her son before proposing just a few months into their relationship. Shortly after their wedding, Lalicata started to disappear overnight or for a few days at a time. When his new wife confronted him, she claims he told her 'he had been gambling and had run up large debts to 'individuals . connected with organized crime in Brooklyn who would hurt him if he did . not pay,' the suit claimed. When his cousin and a friend allegedly backed up his story, Ms Feinberg started to wire tens of thousands of dollars to him to clear the debt. When he allegedly pushed her for a further $150,000 - telling her when the debts were gone they could focus on starting a family - she mortgaged her Upstate New York home to raise the money. The suit claimed that Lalicata staged a handover with a friend posing a gangster, who met them in a car outside the bank so she could hand over the cash. That night, Lalicata allegedly told his wife he was having trouble sleeping and went downstairs - only to disappear. A few days later Ms Feinberg discovered that he had been on vacation with Fernandez in the Dominican Republic. Double life: The lawsuit claims that after they married Steven Lalicata would disappear from the couple's Manhattan apartment, above. When confronted he allegedly told his wife he had run up gambling debts . With the help of a private detective, Ms Feinberg allegedly found her husband had been having a relationship with Fernandez and instead of using her money to pay off gambling debts he had used it for luxury shopping trips to buy his mistress 'jewelry, luxury goods, home . furnishings and travel'. An employee at the couple's former Manhattan apartment told the New York Post Lalicata would return from shopping trips with goods from Louis Vuitton and Armani. The employee, who has not been named, claimed Lalicata would say: 'Hold these for me. Don't tell my wife.' Attempts to get her husband to admit to fraud on tape in July 2012 failed after he allegedly seduced her at a hotel to invalidate the tape. Ms Feinberg told the New York Post: 'I am concerned that these people may pray on other victims ... I believe that they brought me and my young son into their confidences solely from the get go, to steal as much as they could from me.' The suit, filed in the spring of 2013, seeks repayment of $744,105 and $10 million in damages from Lalicata, Fernandez and their friends for false arrest and fraud. A lawyer for Fernandez denied that his client had been involved in any wrongdoing or that she had been romantically involved with Lalicata. Lalicata could not be reached for comment.","Candice Feinberg Lalicata claims she was tricked out of trust fund .

Three of the world's rarest tigers were born to five-year-old Sumatran tigress Melati on February 3 after a 106-day pregnancy, keepers announced today. The cubs arrived in the early hours, and all were born within an hour. The first cub was born at 12.28am, the second at 12.59am and the third made its entrance into the world at 1.18am. Scroll down for video . My babies: Tigress mother Melati cuddles her cubs in the birthing den at London Zoo in Regents Park . Feeding time: The tiger triplets, whose sexes have not yet been determined, suckle on Melati . The entire birth process was monitored using remote camera technology. The zoo has yet to establish the sex of the cubs. Melati and her cubs remain together inside special 'cubbing dens' with the mother only occasionally venturing away from her babies for food. Their birth will be a welcome addition to the zoo as it comes less than six months after the death of the zoo's first Sumatran tiger cub in 17 years. Keepers at the zoo were left 'very distraught' after the cub was found drowned on the edge of the pool inside the tigers' enclosure, two weeks after its birth in October. The cub had been the grandchild of the zoo's last tiger cub, Hari, the father of Melati. Little explorers: Keepers have nicknamed one of the cubs Trouble, as it's much bolder than the others . Welcome addition: The birth of the triplets comes less than six months after Melati's last cub drowned . Zookeeper Teague Stubbington said: 'We couldn't be more delighted with our new arrivals, and with how Melati is responding to her three cubs. 'We've been observing them 24/7, and one of us is always on duty to keep an eye on the little ones throughout the night. We've even been able to observe key milestones like their eyes opening and their tentative first steps. 'While we still don't know whether they're boys or girls, we're starting to see their personalities develop. We've nicknamed one Trouble, as it's much bolder than the others - it was the first to start exploring its den, and we've spotted it waking up its siblings when they fall asleep.' Ever felt like you're being watched? The triplets' entire birth process was monitored using remote cameras . In the Seventies there were 1,000 Sumatran tigers in the wild; today there are believed to be just 300 individuals. If numbers continue to decline at that rate, they face a very real threat of extinction within the next decade. The cubs represent a great achievement for the zoo and the global breeding programme for the critically endangered species. While mother Melati relaxes with her cubs, visitors to the zoo can still see six-year-old father Jae Jae in Tiger Territory, and there will be exclusive footage of the cubs on the zoo's YouTube channel throughout this month.","Sumatran tiger cubs were born on February 3, it was announced today .

"By . Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 15:27 EST, 12 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 21:42 EST, 13 March 2014 . Jailed: David Williamson was jailed for 10 years after threatening London landmarks with bombs and guns . A self-styled terrorist and convicted armed robber who threatened to blow up Harrods, Westminster Abbey and several other London landmarks was jailed for 10 years today. David Williamson, 50, concocted a catalogue of plots across London to 'bring the transport system down', claiming to be a member of a terrorist group called 'Scottish and Irish Sympathisers'. The attacker, who had more than 140 previous convictions, was also sentenced for three counts of possession of an imitation firearm which he used to hold up a travel agent, a hotel reception and to threaten a money shop employee. Described in a psychiatric report as a 'volatile, unpredictable and reckless individual', the court heard he barged into nine of the capital's landmarks - including The Ritz and Hilton Park Lane hotels - telling people a bomb would 'go off'. On October 15, 2012, he sparked a mass evacuation in Harrods after leaving a note - covered in his fingerprints - that read: 'There is a device, bomb, due to go off in this store in 40 minutes.' The world famous store was forced to shut for around 15 minutes incurring a loss of about £40,000. The day before, he left a chilling message for the British Transport Police, saying: 'I have got a message for you. 'Scottish and Irish sympathisers are going to bring down London, starting with the rail network. 'There . are several devices been planted (sic) in various areas. I will not . elaborate until it goes off. I will not elaborate any further until they . go off, and then you will receive a coded message.' And 11 days later, he pulled a 'big gun' on staff in the Money Shop, in Maidstone, after being refused a payday loan. He then went to Best Western Delaware Hotel in Hyde Park, told the receptionist he had a gun, and made off with £205. Sentencing Williamson today, Judge Nicholas Jones told him: 'You have been in trouble in the past, including a firearms offence in 1995. The attacker took a gun into the Money Shop after he was refused a payday loan . This is the gun he was seen to be holding in CCTV. He also told a London hotel he had a gun to make off with £205 . 'Your previous convictions do not make good reading.' He added: 'So far as the bomb hoaxes go, police got the impression at an early stage that they were not credible threats, but they resulted in police attending various venues in west London and I’m told that an emergency phone call from from the public could not be responded to promptly because of your threat.' Jurors heard that after he was arrested and questioned, a voice recognition expert was able to match Williamson’s voice and Scottish accent in the recorded interview to that of the caller on the call centre logs. The court heard from Harrods' head of security Morgan O’Grady who was on duty when the note was found on October 15th and said: 'We couldn’t take risks with peoples lives. 'It could have been a joke, it could have been a disgruntled member of staff who left the note, or it could have been serious. We couldn’t take that risk.' Westminster Abbey was targeted, as was Harrods, which was brought to a standstill for 15 minutes after staff found a note from Williamson, who had 140 previous convictions when jailed at Kingston Crown Court . He described how, trawling through CCTV, he spotted Williamson sat in a leather chair in the store prior to leaving the note and removed the chair so fingerprints could be obtained. Williamson, who is based in both Wimbledon, south London, and Kent, was described as 'nervous' when, days later, he launched his attack on the money store. A member of staff described the weapon as 'black and metallic'. David Harounoff, prosecuting, said: 'The witness heard a clicking sound as if the gun was being loaded. 'He said to him ""just give me my stuff back or I’ll shoot"".' Two days later Williamson entered Thompson Travel Limited, in Golden Square, Warrington, and asked for £15,000 in euros. High-end hotel and restaurant The Ritz was one of the nine landmarks targeted by Williamson . He told staff to 'put that money over there through that hole and don’t say anything' before lifting his top to reveal a 'black handgun tucked into his waist'. Williamson told the staff they had been 'good girls' before making off with £3,895. He made his escape on a bus, but police were waiting for him when he got to Runcorn bus station. He told one of the officers: 'I’m going to kill you'. He later told officers he had bought a black desert eagle BB gun from a shop for £29. Richard Keogh, in mitigation, said that Williamson 'didn’t really get it' and had a mental illness 'bordering on psychiatric illness, but not quite there yet.' Williamson was sentenced to two counts of possession of an imitation firearm at the time of committing an offence namely robbery, two counts of robbery, one count of possession of an imitation firearm with the threat of violence, one count of fraud, and five counts of communication false information with intent.","David Williamson, 50, made threats to nine landmarks across capital .

A 20-year-old Lousiana mother confessed to police Tuesday to killing her ill 17-month-old son by injecting his feeding tube with Germ-X brand hand sanitizer. Erika Wigstrom told police she did it to 'end his suffering,' after the boy was born with Down's syndrome and a serious heart defect. The boy's father Cesar Ruiz, 20, is already behind bars after a similar attempt to kill the baby in October 2012 in which rum was injected into his feeding tube, causing him seizures and brain damage. In her interview with police March 11, . Wigstrom revealed it was actually she who was behind the first attempt . at killing little Lucas Ruiz and she'd used perfume, not rum. Scroll down for video... Confessed: Erika Wigstrom, 20, told police Tuesday that she killed her 17-onth-old son who suffered from Down's syndrome and heart defects by injecting his feeding tube with Germ-X brand hand sanitizer . It's happened before: Lucas Ruiz, left, died from acute alcohol intoxication in January. It was the second time he'd been poisoned with alcohol. The first time, he was just 2 months old and his father Cesar Ruiz, right, confessed he did it to ease the infant's pain. He claimed he didn't mean to kill or hurt Lucas. One-year-old Lucas died back on January 24 from acute alcohol intoxication, reports the Times-Picayune. That's when police were called to a home in Belle Chasse, where they found the child 'breathless and pulseless.' He was rushed to a hospital in New Orleans, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. An autopsy was performed and found the boy's blood alcohol level to be 0.280. 'The legal limit in Louisiana is .08 so that would mean almost four and a half times the legal limit,' Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's Office Cmdr. Eric Becnel told WVUE. The autopsy results were revealed earlier this month and police then interviewed Wigstrom on Tuesday. She reportedly told them she'd injected . Lucas feeding tube with the alcohol-heavy hand sanitizer, but that he . didn't die until a day later. The story changes: After police determined that Lucas had been murdered, the interviewed Wigstrom. After confessing to killing her son to 'end his suffering,' she told police she'd been the one who tried it in 2012, not Ruiz. She also revealed she'd given the boy perfume in an attempt to kill him, not rum . Putting on an act? Wigstrom's confession may come as a surprise to anyone who saw a local news segment shot in spring of 2013 when she called out Lucas's father for harming their child and described the heartache she felt as he suffered seizures in her arms . Four times the legal limit: Lucas had a hole in his heart and was in and out of the hospital. He also reportedly had three holes in his heart. His BAC at the time of death was .280 . On top of the horrific suffering Lucas must have endured in the hours before his death, he'd already suffered seizures and brain damage after rum was dumped into his feeding tube as he lay in the hospital in October 2012 undergoing treatment for his heart defect. Wigstrom told police on Tuesday that she'd caused that, too. Lucas's father had confessed to the poisoning at the time and said he'd done it, not to kill him, but to ease his suffering. At peace: Lucas suffered seizures and brain damage after the 2012 attempt on his life. He also survived for a day before dying from the hand sanitizer poisoning early this year. He died January 24 . He remained behind bars just as Wigstrom was admitting to police it had been her all along. 'From what I gathered from the detectives, they basically said she had no remorse,' said Cmdr. Becnel. But the young mother was singing a far different tune while Lucas was still in her care. Just last April, Wigstrom told WWLTV of the trauma she endured as Lucas suffered from the rum poisoning and of how it caused a rift between her and the baby's father. 'That baby had a seizure in that hospital bed with me and all the nurses and the ICU doctors standing around his bed, for 58 minutes. I talked to that baby the entire time, trying to get him to come back to me,' she said last year. 'Right now, I have no relationship with him. I do not desire a relationship with him. I will never have a relationship with him,' Wigstrom said. Cesar Ruiz was charged with second-degree cruelty to a juvenile, but it remained unclear just after Wigstrom's arrest whether he'd still stand trial. Wigstrom, however, will stand trial. And at a bond hearing Wednesday, she broke down in tears as her charge was read: first degree murder. 'With the evidence and the age of the child, we believe we have a strong case,' Becnel said. He also marveled in disbelief at the case. 'It's a tragic situation. I don't know what goes through someone's head, to harm a 17-month-old. I have a 19-month-old myself, and I couldn't put it in my system to do something like that,' he said. No bond was set for Wigstrom. She faces life in prison if convicted.","Erika Wigstrom, 20, told police she injected hand sanitizer into her 17-month-old son's feeding tube 'to end his suffering'

Eric Justin Toth spent five years on the run, living in Arizona and Texas before escaping the country. In 2012, the FBI put him on its 'Ten Most Wanted' list, where he filled a vacancy created by Osama bin Laden's death. Before sentencing him on Tuesday a judge noted his skill at evading law enforcement and the large number of victims in the case, 17 in all. Eric Justin Toth, presented to the press at a Managua, Nicaragua, police station after his arrest on April 22, 2013, was sentenced today to 25 years in prison for possessing child pornography . Toth had asked for 22 years in prison â€” expressing remorse and promising to ""do penance"" for his deeds. A prosecutor asked for 30. 'I know I've hurt people, a lot of people,' Toth told Judge Rudolph Contreras at a federal court hearing. Toth, 32, became choked up while speaking, at points tearing up but at others attempting to joke. Toth, who will spend a lifetime on supervised release after he leaves prison, mentioned Google Glass and said he told his lawyer he could wear glasses that allow officials to see what he's seeing and ensure he is staying away from children. He promised to spend his time in prison 'trying to do penance in whatever humble ways I can.' Toth previously wrote in a letter to the judge that one of the things he wants to do is train seeing eye dogs as part of a prison program.

Fighter ace Squadron Leader Billy Drake's Second World War medals have sold at auction for an incredible £84,000 – triple the original estimate. The Battle of Britain veteran shot down at least 25 enemy planes and was awarded ten medals and a bar – including a Distinguished Service Order (DSO), Distinguish Flying Cross (DFC) and bar and the American DFC for his air combat skills. Auctioneers Bonhams expected the lot to fetch up to £30,000 when they went under the hammer today but the London-born ace's medals soared way past the estimate. Sq Ldr Billy Drake pictured during the war . The sale helped bring the total of the lot - ‘Military Medals: The Property of a Gentleman’ - to £570,036. Other medals under the hammer included a Distinguished Flying Cross from 1941, a 1939-1945 Star with Battle of Britain bar, and Air Crew Europe Star with France and Germany bar, an Africa Star with North Africa bar. Sq Ldr Drake was born in 1917 to an English father and Australian mother, and was educated in Switzerland before joining the RAF before his 18th birthday. On the outbreak of war, he saw service in the Battle of Britain, and over North Africa, Italy and Normandy. Flying Hurricanes he had countless clashes with the Luftwaffe over the skies of France before his first enemy kill on April 19, 1940 when he downed a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter while providing air cover for the British Expeditionary Force. For gallantry: Sq Ldr Billy Drake's medals, which were auctioned at Bonhams and reached £84,000 - triple what they were expected to fetch . When the Blitzkrieg was launched in May, Sq Ldr Drake shot down three Dornier 17s and helped destroy another in just three days. Despite a stint in a French hospital after being forced to bail out after his Hurricane was shot up, he returned to his squadron in England and taught fighter pilots before joining 213 Squadron out of Tangmere during the Battle of Britain. Flying a Spitfire, he helped to bring down a bomber and damaged a number of others. In December he was awarded a DFC. He earned his silver gilt and enamel DSO in 1942 during his time as a fighter pilot in charge of 112 Squadron in North Africa where he destroyed more than 17 enemy aircrafts – including two Stuka dive bombers and two transport aircraft on the ground. The Supermarine Spitfire was one of the aeroplanes responsible for defeating the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain . The Hurricane first flew in November 1935 and 14,533 were produced between 1937 and 1944 . Sq Ldr Drake – a distant relative of Sir Francis Drake – was promoted to wing commander and posted to Malta in charge of a Spitfire wing. His winning streak continued destroying six enemy aircrafts and picked up an American DFC in the same year for his ‘courage and audacity’ protecting USAAF bombers attacking Sicily. Back in wartime Blighty, he commanded a Typhoon Wing and attacked German V-1 Doodlebug launch sites in Pas de Calais, and went on to become a respected instructor at the RAF Fighter Leader's School. He ended the war behind the desk in America but on his return to the UK was made Deputy Commander at Biggin Hill and later went to HQ SHAEF to serve in the Operations Room. He took part in the 1945 Battle of Britain flypast. He passed away on August 28, 2011, aged 93. John Millensted, the head of the coins and medals department at Bonhams, said: ‘The medals achieved a great result and far exceeded our expectations on the day.

Keller even had some of the child pornography DVDs sent to him at the academy's student health center. The former doctor was given the chance to speak at his sentencing hearing on Wednesday, and he expressed how 'embarrassed' he was for himself, his friends and his family. 'The hypocrisy of my behavior is not lost on me, for I betrayed a public trust,' he said. Keller admitted to living in a 'heinous and vile subculture' but that he wanted to turn his life around by acting as an advocate for the poor and disenfranchised. 'Please know I have done much good in my life, and I have a good heart,' he said. His lawyer, Max Stern, stressed that Keller did not want to minimize the seriousness of his crimes. 'He has had a tortured existence, an agonizing existence,' Stern said. 'He calls it a tumor. ... Now he is free to face his demons.' Keller, who is still in a romantic relationship with a woman and has a 2-year-old child, pleaded guilty last November to charges of receiving and possessing pornography depicting boys between the ages of 7 and 16. Before he was charged with child pornography possession in September 2012, Keller was working as a doctor at Boston Children's Hospital. And before that, he spent nearly two decades as the medical director at prestigious prep school Phillips Academy . Keller purchased some $2,695 worth of child pornography before getting caught. Above, a picture of Harvard University, where Keller taught part-time . Some of those videos were sent to him at his office at Phillips Academy, where he resigned after 19 years in April 2011 when the school decided not to renew his contract. In an email to students and parents following Keller's arrest, headmaster John Palfrey wrote that Keller had been dismissed because of professional misconduct that didn't have anything to do with the child porn case. Palfrey relayed that Keller was caught using school computers to access adult porn in 1999, and that he showed an inappropriate cartoon to students in 2002, but that there is no reason to believe students were abused by Keller. Keller voluntarily surrendered his medical license after his arrest. He now faces a minimum of five years and three months in prison, and a maximum of six-and-a-half years. In addition to his prison time, Keller will be on probation for an additional five-and-a-half years after his release and have to pay a $10,000 fine. He has also been ordered to undergo counseling and stay away from children without an adult present.","Authorities found over 100 child porn DVDs at the home of Richard Keller, who used to work at Boston Children's Hospital .

If you want to join the likes of Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr and Mother Teresa in having a Nobel Peace Prize it's easy - you just need £50,000 in your back pocket. A lost prize which surfaced in a South American pawn shop is going under the hammer, becoming only the second ever to be auctioned. The 23-carat solid gold medal was awarded to Argentina's foreign minister in 1936 for his role ending a brutal South American war which killed 100,000 people. After he died in 1959, however, the prize's whereabouts were unknown for decades. Priceless: This Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to Argentinia's foreign minister in 1936, was thought to have been lost but will be auctioned later this month - 20 years after it surfaced in a South American pawn shop . Now it has emerged the medal was traded in at a pawn shop in South America 20 years ago. Whoever brought the prize to the shop may have had no idea of its true value, instead trading the 222.4g piece for the value of its gold. Historic: The award was given to Carlos Saavedra Lamas, its first Latin American recipient, in 1936 . Instead of revealing it, the pawnbroker sold it to a U.S. dealer who he had done business with before. He took it back to his home country and sold it to another dealer, who then sold it to the Charles A Wharton collection - a pseudonym for a wealthy collector who died more than 10 years ago. The man's descendants have now decided to sell it, meaning its history can be revealed. The solid gold medal will be auctioned in Baltimore by New York's Stack's Bowers Galleries on March 27 and the value of its gold alone is said to be $9,168 (£5,521). John Kraljevich, a specialist in historical medals and a consultant to Stack's Bowers, told MailOnline: 'The words Nobel Peace Prize are only engraved in French on the edge so they might not have known what they had and thought ""oh, it's just another gold medal"". 'There are an awful lot of gold medals in the world and most of them are only worth the value of their bullion. 'The dealer who bought it from South America is protecting his source and won't tell us where the shop was, something that's quite common in the antiques and coin world. 'Had the shop owner not recognized that it . might be worth more to somebody than just the value of the bullion ... it would have been melted and thrown in with broken gold earrings.' The medal has a tiny file mark on the edge, which Mr Kraljevich said was a sign someone had tried to work out how pure the gold was in case it was melted down. He added: 'I would say it's more famous than an . Olympic gold medal. 'When you look at the list of past . recipients, they're obviously some of the most important people to walk . the face of the globe in the last 100-plus years. 'This was definitely special. What struck me was how heavy it is - it's almost half a pound of gold so it has a significant heft to it in your hand. It's very sculptural.' Detail: The back of the gold medal, first awarded in 1901, features three men in a fraternal bond with the Latin inscription: 'Pro pace et fraternitate gentium' ('For the peace and brotherhood of men') Legacy: The front of the medal features the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the prize . The Nobel Peace Prize was one of five . created by the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented . dynamite, and was first awarded in 1901. Its most famous recipients have included Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa. The other prizes are for chemistry, physics, medicine and literature. 'I can't think of many public . collections that have a Nobel Prize, never mind a Nobel Peace Prize . medal,' said Ute Wartenberg, executive director of the American . Numismatic Society. 'This was definitely special. What struck me was how heavy it is - it's almost half a pound of gold so it has a significant heft to it in your hand. It's very sculptural.' -  Medals specialist John Kraljevich . 'This is an incredible rarity.' Other Nobel awards have sold at auction, but only one other Peace Prize is known to have come under the hammer. The 1903 medal awarded to Sir William Cremer, the Liberal MP who was a champion of free speech and created Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park through an Act of Parliament, sold for £11,550 ($16,748) in 1985 at Sotheby's. The 1936 prize is expect to fetch at least $50,000 to $100,000 (£30,106 to £60,212). The Charles A Wharton collection also owned a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, one of the world's most prestigious journalism and arts awards. It will be sold alongside the Nobel Peace Prize at the same auction - becoming the first gold Pulitzer medal ever to go under the hammer. The 14-carat gold medallion was presented to the newspaper New York World-Telegram in 1933 for a series of articles exposing scam lottery schemes. The newspaper also won the award for stories on veterans' relief, real estate bonds and a campaign urging voters in New York to vote for Democrat Joseph V McKee by 'writing in' his name despite the fact he did not appear on the ballot. Founded when the New York World and Evening Telegram merged two years earlier, the newspaper only survived for three more decades and was merged into a string of unsuccessful titles in 1966. The Pulitzer prize is expected to fetch between $15,000 and $30,000 (£9,033 and £18,066). The public service award is the only category of the prize to be awarded a gold medal. All the others receive monetary awards. Rare: The only other Nobel Peace Prize ever to be auctioned was given to the pacifist and trade unionist Sir William Cremer (pictured) in 1903. He was its first solo recipient and helped found Speakers' Corner in London . Sale: The same collector owned this Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, which will be the first ever auctioned . War: The winner of the 1936 prize helped to end the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay which broke out over several land disputes and killed 100,000 men. Pictured: Soldiers drinking in Paraguay . Held: Some of the 7,000 Paraguayan prisoners captured in March 1935 by Bolivian forces . While Europe was distracted by Nazi Germany in the 1930s, a brutal war was killing tens of thousands of people in South America. Fought between Bolivia and Paraguay, the Chaco War lasted from 1933 to 1935 over a 100,000 square mile wilderness and was the culmination of tensions which had lasted several decades. Clashes: Residents of La Paz in Bolivia gather to demonstrate against Paraguay in 1932 . When the War of the Pacific ended in 1884, Chile defeated Bolivia and annexed Bolivia's coast, leaving its citizens landlocked and frustrated. So Bolivia started encroaching onto Paraguay, which initiated a string of clashes in December 1928 - clashes which led to a full-scale war despite the efforts of the United States. A truce was finally arranged on June 12, . 1935, in a peace conference which included Argentina, . Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and the United States. It allowed Paraguay to have clear ownership of most of . the disputed region, but Bolivia was given a corridor to the Paraguay . River and a port, Puerto Casado. Most of the credit went to Argentina's foreign minister Carlos Saavedra Lamas, who was the key figure behind the truce. He became the first person from outside Western Europe and the U.S. to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. He was also crucial to Argentina joining the League of Nations in 1932. In his mid-fifties when he won the prestigious award, he came from landed gentry and gained a PhD in law before becoming a professor of constitutional law. He won his first elected post aged 30 and later became the Minister of Justice and Minister of Education before heading the country's foreign affairs for six years. Why the medal left his family and ended up in a pawn shop is a mystery. Mr Kraljevich told MailOnline: 'He had a son, and his son had a son - but after that the trail goes cold. The grandson died at some time in the '70s. 'It may have ended up in some distant part of the family where they didn't care about it or maybe they just needed the money. 'It does seem odd but sometimes people just don't care about their family history that much.'","The 23-carat medal was awarded to Argentina's foreign minister in 1936 .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 16:13 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:11 EST, 7 March 2014 . Business tycoon Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States is 'becoming a third-world country,' declared the nation's true unemployment rate is 'probably 21 or 22 percent,' and warned that Barack Obama's approval ratings were approaching the malaise of 'the late, great Jimmy Carter.' Carter, the 39th U.S. president, is very much alive. The gaffe took the luster off of an otherwise energetic presentation at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C., one that was lacking any hint that Trump might run for president in 2016. Railing against federal tax and other economic mandates that will trigger in the years after President Barack Obama leaves office, Trump said he predictions of 'economic catastrophe' in 2017 and 2018 are flying through the business community. 'Whoever's president [then], good luck!' he exclaimed. You're going to have to be very smart. You're going to have to be very sharp.' Scroll down for video . A frustrated Donald Trump said he's anticipating economic calamities right after President Barack Obama leaves office, and said the U.S. is 'becoming a Third World country' Still kicking: Rumors of Jimmy Carter assuming 'late, great' status, as Trump referred to him Thursday, are greatly exaggerated . 'Our country is in serious, serious trouble,' Trump lamented. 'We owe $17 trillion – our debt. How do you pay off $17 trillion? ... We have deficits that no one can even comprehend.' Obama, he insisted, is 'so weak and so pathetic' that China's leaders know they can devalue their currency without any consequences. 'They believe that they can get away with it,' Trump said. 'And believe me, they're taking our jobs, and they're taking them big-league .... They have no respect for our leader.' Unemployment, Trump told thousands gathered at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, is 'probably 21 or 22 percent' in 'real numbers.' 'When you give up looking for a job, it's like they consider you employed,' he complained. The U.S. Department of Labor said in January that the nation's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent. But the so-called 'U-6' unemployment measure, which counts short-term workers and those who have taken themselves out of the labor force,' is early twice as high – 13.1 per cent. MailOnline couldn't find any economic research suggesting a 21 or 22 per cent unemployment rate in the U.S. Trump could get into the presidential race in 2016, but seemed to suggest he'll sit it out . Rough life: Trump flew to Washington on Thursday after opening the new Tiger Woods Villa World Golf Championships at his Trump National Doral Golf Course in Florida . Trump said he sees 'so little leadership from the White House,' topped off with a crumbling infrastructure – airports, roads and bridges – that slows down business entrepreneurs . 'We're becoming a third-world country,' he complained. After noting briefly that the Obamacare law 'has to be changed – has to be!' Trump warned conservatives that siding with advocates of immigration reform will bring Election Day legitimacy to a slew of new Democratic Party voters. 'Every one of those votes goes to the . Democrats.... you will not get any of those votes no matter what you do, . no matter how nice you are, no matter how soft you are,' he said. Coming down on the side of closed-border hawks, an exasperated Trump threw up his hands. 'We're either a country or we're not. We either have borders or we don't,' he told an appreciative crowd. 'I mean, you have a border, you have a country, and if you don't have a border, what are we? Uh, uh, uh – nothing.' Trump will appear at an April 12 summit in New Hampshire alongside Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Minnesota Rep. Marsha Blackburn.","Trump referred to Obama's tanking approval ratings as nearing the lows of 'the late, great Jimmy Carter'

The average bonus paid to securities industry employees in New York City grew 15 percent last year to more than $164,000, the largest average Wall Street bonus since the 2008 financial crisis and the third highest on record, New York's state comptroller reported Wednesday. The securities industry has been profitable for five consecutive years, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said. It had 165,200 workers in New York City as of December, or 12.6 percent fewer than before the crisis. Profits for broker/dealer operations of some 200 New York Stock Exchange members â€” the traditional measure of profitability for the securities industry â€” totaled nearly $16.7 billion last year, down 30 percent from a year earlier. On Wall Street, profits are down and the number of workers is shrinking but bonuses continue to grow larger. Cash bonuses paid to Wall Street employees in New York City rose 15 per cent . 'Although profits were lower than the prior year, the industry still had a good year in 2013 despite costly legal settlements and higher interest rates,' DiNapoli said. 'Wall Street continues to demonstrate resilience as it evolves in a changing regulatory environment.' Regulatory changes have required larger reserves, limited proprietary trading and imposed other changes intended to reduce risk. Firms now defer a larger share of bonuses, and the comptroller's report for 2013 includes money deferred from prior years. Money money money: New York securities firms will pay out $26.7 billion in cash bonuses and deferred compensation from previous years for performance in 2013 . The report showed the bonus pool for the city's securities employees grew 15 percent last year to $26.7 billion during the traditional December-March bonus season, with the pool increased by 44 percent over the past two years driven by deferred compensation. The average salary including bonuses in 2012 was $360,700, or more than five times greater than the rest of the rest of the private sector. The industry accounted for 22 percent of all private sector city wages in 2012 and 5 percent of the jobs, the report said. The securities industry generated an estimated $3.8 billion in city taxes in fiscal year 2013 and $10.3 billion in state taxes in the state's last fiscal year. The $26.7 billion in bonuses Wall Street banks handed out in 2013 would be enough to more than double the pay for all 1,085,000 full-time U.S. minimum wage workers, according to an Institute for Policy Studies analysis of New York State Comptroller bonus figures released this morning. The Institute for Policy Studies, a Washington-based think tank that calls itself 'a policy and research resource for visionary social justice movements,' said the $26.7 billion would be enough to more than double the pay for more than 1 million Americans who work full time at the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour.","Bankers on Wall Street are bringing home their biggest bonuses since before the 2008 financial crisis .

'We have a lot of land and we are going to do our very best to make the second course as good as the first.' On the resort's website, Mr Trump states: 'She grew up in a simple croft until she landed in Manhattan at the age of 20 and her first language was Gaelic.'","Tycoon objected to plans near multi-million pound Aberdeenshire .

Charged: Michael Jason Fields, 32 (pictured) has been accused of bludgeoning his 32-year-old girlfriend, Christina Mahzamani, to death with a cinder block . A 32-year-old man has been accused of bludgeoning his girlfriend to death with a cinder block in his Florida backyard and trying to conceal the murder. Michael Jason Fields has been charged with killing mother-of-three Christina Mahzamani on Sunday night at a home on St Cloud Oaks Drive in Valrico where he rents a room. He was arrested on Tuesday afternoon, just hours after calling police to say he'd found the single mom's body outside his house. According to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, Fields beat Mahzamani to death before dumping her car half a mile away from his house and dragging her lifeless body to the front pavement in a bid to cover-up her death. For Mahzaman's devastated children, the horror began on Sunday when their mom left their Brandon home about 9pm to pick up eye drops and didn't return. According to the police statement, the children - aged 13, nine and seven - called their father, who was interstate, to say they were home alone. The father called Vali Mahzamani, understood to be a relative of the victim, who took the children to his house. When Mahzamani hadn't returned home by 8.45pm on Monday, Vali Mahzamani filed a missing person's report. Earlier that day, Mahzamani's 2013 Buick Enclave was found abandoned and blocking a driveway on Briar Meadows Drive in Valrico, with her car keys and other personal items inside. Fearing the worst, Mahzamani's family and friends set up a Facebook page - Find Christina Mahzamani - in a desperate bid to find the 32-year-old. Police had no luck in their search - until 2.20pm Tuesday when Fields called 911 to say he'd found a deceased woman outside his residence. Tragic: Christina Mahzamani's battered body was found on Tuesday outside her boyfriend's home on St. Cloud Oaks Drive in Valrico, Florida . Heartbreaking: Mahzamani was a single mom who friends say doted on her three young children (pictured). They were the last to see her on Sunday night . When detectives interviewed Fields at the crime scene, he said Mahzamani visited him at his home about 11pm Sunday and drove away in her vehicle a short time later. He said he didn't hear from her again. However crime scene investigators didn't believe him, claiming they'd discovered blood at the scene, . footprints near that blood matching Fields' shoes, a blood-covered cinder block and a pair of pajamas . in Fields' bedroom with blood on it. They also claimed to have found drag marks on the grass and leaves leading from the backyard towards the middle of two houses. Police arrested Fields, a handyman and personal trainer, and charged him with second-degree murder with a weapon. However they say the motive for the alleged murder is not clear.

George Zimmerman has made a video with his new legal team where he says that he’s  trying to be a good person and he thinks he can help others after what he has gone through. Zimmerman said he was trying to figure out who he is and he was doing the interview to 'show America who I truly am.' In the video made Friday in Orlando, Zimmerman highlights his participation in a program in which he was a mentor to an African-American boy, and he also describes his efforts to raise awareness about a local case in which a black homeless man was beaten by the son of a white police lieutenant. Speaking out: George Zimmerman released a taped interview with his lawyers as he tries to move on with his life in the wake of his acquittal in the murder of Trayvon Martin . Zimmerman said some day he would like to be able to go to law school and become a civil rights or defense attorney. 'On a grand scale, I would like to make enough of an impact on the judicial system so that what happens to me never happens to anybody,' Zimmerman said. During the more than 20-minute interview, Zimmerman, dressed in a gray blazer and blue dress shirt, looks directly at the camera as he sits in an office chair. When asked by an off-camera attorney what his daily life is like, Zimmerman said he worries constantly about his safety. 'The only thing consistent is having to always look over my shoulder and be concerned about others around me,' he said. Zimmerman said he's trying to be a faithful family man but realizes that everything he does, good or bad, is heavily scrutinized. Mentor: Zimmerman shared a muzzed photo of himself with the African American teenage boy that he mentored before the Trayvon Martin shooting . Occasion: As a sixth grade graduation present, Zimmerman took the boy he was mentoring to meet NBA star Dwight Howard . He told a story of how before the Martin killing, he fought for justice in a beating case where a black homeless man named Sherman Ware who was attacked by a young white man. Zimmerman told how he raised awareness for the case and complained to the Sanford Police Department. His work was rewarded by the friendship of a priest who worked in the jail when Zimmerman turned himself in for Trayvon Martin's death. 'It felt good to know that everything comes around in life and even though you think some things are never going to be seen,' he said. He went on to tell how he and his soon-to-be ex wife Shellie decided to enroll as mentors in a state-run program and they were partnered with a pair of African American siblings. The Zimmermans took the children to the park and a local science center. He said that as a reward for passing sixth grade, George took the boy he was mentoring to meet NBA star Dwight Howard, and he included two photos of the occasion in the video. He said that he has stayed in touch with the boy and his family, and is well known by the children in the neighborhood because he would regularly play basketball with them. Some supporters: Zimmerman said that he is no longer able to go out in public like he once was but he did attend a gun show in Orlando over the weekend . 'A lot of kids ask me if I could be their mentor still and that really strikes a chord with me,' he said. Activities like basketball are no longer in the cards for Zimmerman, he said, as he has lived in a degree of fear ever since the acquittal last summer. 'The only consistent (thing) is always having to look over my shoulder. Always concerned for others around me. I miss out on a lot of the things I would normally enjoy doing,' he said. 'I can't go outside and play basketball. I can go to the grocery store if I wear a hat and sunglasses but even then I'm recognized. 'It's difficult, and its something that I didn't ask for but it's been placed on me so I have to try my best to adapt to it. 'I do realize there is no expiration date on the bounty on my head. Killer but not legally a murderer: Trayvon Martin (left) was shot dead by Zimmerman (right) in February 2012 . 'I hope for the best, I truly do, and I try to work towards that goal but I also keep in the back of my mind that it may not get better, it could even get worse.' The end of the murder trial wasn't the end of Zimmerman's legal troubles, however, as he had separate confrontations with his now-estranged wife, Shellie, and a former girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe. Neither Shellie Zimmerman nor Scheibe pursued charges against Zimmerman and the investigations ended without an arrest. One of Zimmerman's divorce attorneys, Howard Iken, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the divorce process involves 'moving on and having a new life,' and that the video's release helps Zimmerman by allowing him to control his message. 'The publicity surrounding him is unfair and misinformed, especially the allegations he is a racist or bigot,' Iken said.","Zimmerman has revealed that he mentored a young African American boy up until the weekend before he shot and killed Trayvon Martin .

The MoD has been warned that it faces 'a global storm of protest' after it unveiled plans to build homes for soldiers near Stonehenge. Outraged experts claim that the houses would block the world-famous solstice sunrise at the Wiltshire monument. Army bosses want to build 4,000 homes for soldiers and their families returning from Germany on an old airfield overlooking the monument, but experts said the buildings would occupy the exact spot that the sun peeks over the horizon on the longest day of the year. Popular: The solstice is watched by thousands of people every year, with the sun peeking through the Stonehenge stones . Plans: The proposed sites for the MoD housing near Stonehenge, just to the north-east of the site . Lighting the way: This map shows the direction of the sunlight at Stonehenge during the summer solstice, and how it intersects the MoD's proposed housing site . It’s an event that’s watched by some 20,000 people and leading archaeo-astronomer Simon Banton predicted there would be uproar if the plan goes ahead. The Stonehenge guide said when the airfield, at Larkhill, was built in 1910, military chiefs left a gap for the sunrise and bosses should similarly respect the ancient monument. He said: ‘Stonehenge is the focus of a World Heritage Site of enormous cultural importance. Controversy: The MoD wants to build houses on a site that experts say is directly in line with the summer solstice sunrise . Stonehenge was built and rebuilt over 600 years in three main phases. The first - begun in 3000BC - saw the creation of a ditch and bank which later enclosed a circle of 56 holes for posts or stones. Around 2600BC the site was transformed into two circles of 82 blue stones brought from the Welsh mountains. Then, 150 years later, the ancient Britons set up 50-ton sarsen stones quarried at Marlborough, 25 miles away. There are dozens of theories about Stonehenge's purpose. At least 52 bodies were cremated and buried at Stonehenge, leading some experts to conclude the site was used for elaborate funerals. Some believe the monument was a centre of medicine with the circle's creators believing the Welsh blue stones had magical powers. The human remains on the site belong to sick people who came to be cured. Others think it is a calendar and observatory as the stones are aligned with the summer and winter solstices - the longest and shortest days of the year. The site, they say, would be used to predict eclipses and to mark lunar cycles. Meanwhile, believers in New Age superstitions claim Stonehenge is a centre of mystical lines of energy that cross Britain. Believers in alien life say Stonehenge was a landing site for flying saucers. ‘It is internationally famous, instantly recognisable and the solstitial alignment of the monument is intrinsic to its original purpose. ‘To propose building across this alignment invites a global storm of protest from groups as diverse as heritage bodies, astronomers, prehistorians, UNESCO, religious orders and the wider public. ‘The MoD needs to demonstrate that it is fully sensitive to the World Heritage Site in order to avoid the potential outrage and reputational damage, not only to itself but also to Britain in the eyes of the world. ‘When Larkhill Aerodrome was first established in the early 20th Century, a series of aeroplane sheds was built along the east side of Wood Road. ‘These early military and civilian aviators were keenly aware of their responsibility and so a wide space was deliberately left between the aeroplane sheds at the north end and those further south in order to allow the Summer Solstice sunrise to continue to shine unobstructed down to Stonehenge.’ He said the gap is already partially obstructed by a copse of tall trees which the Army should also remove to completely restore the sightline from Stonehenge to the horizon. He added: ‘This possibility will be entirely removed if the sites are built upon.’ English Heritage and UNESCO is understood to be considering Mr Banton's report before commenting, but Wiltshire Museum bosses agreed with the expert. Curator David Dawson said: ‘Today, if you look towards the horizon there are some trees but even in 1910 when there were some air hangars built they left a gap between them so that you could still see the sunrise.’ Pagan leader King Arthur Pendragon, 59, vowed to fight any development that would threaten Stonehenge. 'I oppose completely,' he said. 'I will be the first person blocking it if they decide to go ahead with the plans. 'Obviously I understand there is a need to build these houses but there is no need to build them in the way of the light. 'What you've got to remember is that around 30,000 people descend here every summer for the solstice. 'All they need to do is alter the plans just ever so slightly. The sunrise has been observed for thousands of years - everyone appreciates that and therefore they haven't threatened that. 'For the sake of building a few miles away it would be tragic to destroy something so important to so many people. 'I will oppose anything that threatens Stonehenge.' The MoD is currently holding a consultation on the massive expansion of the army bases to the north and east of Stonehenge. It disputes that the project will affect the site. An MoD spokesperson said: ‘The MoD is not considering any development that will affect Stonehenge. 'We are aware of concerns about the proposed development in the Larkhill area and will be meeting with all interested parties to address these issues.' Theories: Some people think that Stonehenge was built to heal people - others that it's a landing zone for alien spacecraft .","Army bosses want to build homes for soldiers on an airfield by Stonehenge .

A fraternity and sorority at the University of Connecticut have been suspended after a sophomore girl ended up in the hospital after being hazed in an incident inspired by the film Dazed and Confused. Kappa Kappa Gamma member Hillary Holt says she went to a party with her sorority at fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon's off-campus house last week where she was forced to drink beer, wine and shots until she blacked out. Following the incident, both houses have been placed on probation as both the school and local police investigate. The hazing report also factored into the historic decision by Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national officials to ban pledging at all chapters. Scroll down for video . Hazed: University of Connecticut sophomore and Kappa Kappa Gamma member Hillary Holt says she was force-fed alcohol and ordered to 'sizzle like bacon' at a recent fraternity party . Time out: The sorority (pictured above) and fraternity are on suspension while the university and local police investigate the incident . In an interview with WFSB, Holt describes the dangerous scene at last Thursday's party. She says brothers and sisters held drinks to their mouths and forced them to drink the liquor. At one point she and others were ordered to lie on the floor and pretend to 'sizzle like bacon', imitating a scene from the film Dazed and Confused. In the film, a group of high school senior women haze the incoming freshmen girls by making them lie on the ground and roll around while they yell: 'Fry like bacon you little piggies!' Original: Holt says she and other members were ordered to 'sizzle like bacon', imitating a scene from the film Dazed and Confused where character Simone (played by Joey Lauren Adams) hazes a group of incoming high school freshmen . Inspiration: In the 1993 film, the freshmen girls are ordered to lie on the cement and wiggle while Simone yells: 'Fry like bacon you piggies!' Holt said she drank so much she blacked out and woke up in the hospital where she was told her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the limit of 0.08. 'You have seven to nine people yelling at you, girls and guys, and if you don't do what they tell you to, the consequences could get worse,' Holt said. In a letter to the organizations, the school said the interim suspension is not meant to be punitive, but part of the investigative process and used 'when information indicates that the presence of your organization on campus could pose a threat to the health and safety of the campus community.' The local Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity declined to comment and referred all inquiries to their national offices. The Kappa Kappa Gamma house even put up a 'No Trespassing' sign at the end of their driveway. Keep out: Hoping to dodge reporters' questions, the sorority put up a make-shift 'No Trespassing' sign at the end of their campus driveway . Kappa Kappa Gamma's national office issued a statement saying it was working with the university on the investigation and does not tolerate hazing. Brandon Weghorst, a national spokesman for Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the fraternity sent a letter to the UConn chapter ordering it to halt all operations while it conducts its own investigation. 'SAE offers its apologies to Miss Holt for any hazing or ordeal that she may have been subjected to, especially in a Sigma Alpha Epsilon house,' he said. 'And we apologize if any of our members were responsible for those actions. They are not consistent with our expectations.' Weghorst noted that the national fraternity last week changed its structure to eliminate the pledging process in an effort to 'address some of these issues'. Pledging is the process of becoming a new member of a Greek organization and the process can often involve doing dangerous or embarrassing tasks in fraternity recruitment. Pushed: Last week's hazing reports at UConn factored into the SAE national office's decision to ban pledging . According to a recent report in Bloomberg, SAE is the deadliest U.S. fraternity. It's not the first time the fraternity has faced sanctions at UConn. SAE was placed on probation in 2004 after the alleged theft of some snacks from a local convenience store. It was given a warning in 2007 for damage caused to a university meeting room. And in 2010, the fraternity was again placed on probation after it was determined that several members riding on its homecoming float were intoxicated and one of them had urinated on another organization's float.","The local chapters of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity were put on suspension following hazing allegations .

Barack Obama today traded insults with Hangover star Zach Galifianakis in a hilarious episode of the Funny or Die satirical sketch show. The President joked about his birth certificate, his basketball skills and the merits of the Hangover movies as he appeared on the show to promote the Affordable Care Act. The sketch series Between Two Ferns runs on Will Ferrell’s comedy site is a cult hit, with Galifianakis regularly interrupting and insulting the guests with inappropriate questions. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Starting it off on the wrong foot: 'Between Two Ferns' is set up to look like a poorly-funded public access program . Who laughed first: The President couldn't keep a straight face like Galifianakis . His sit-down with the President was no different, and Mr Obama’s speech writing team clearly had fun setting up some insults of his own. ‘You said if you had a son, you would not let him play football. What makes you think he would want to play football? What if he was a nerd like you?’ Galifianakis  said. Galifianakis: Sorry I had to cancel a few times- my mouse pad broke last week and I had to get my great aunt some diabetes shoes . Galifianakis: First question: In 2013, you pardoned a turkey. What do you have planned for 2014?                                                Obama: We'll probably pardon another turkey. We do that every Thanksgiving. Was that depressing to you? One turkey taken out of circulation- one turkey you couldn't eat? Galifianakis: I would make same sex divorce illegal and then see how bad they want it. Obama: I think that's why you're not president, and that's a good thing. Galifianakis: So how does this work? Do you send Ambassador Rodman to North Korea on your behalf? I read somewhere that you would be sending Hulk Hogan to Syria- or is that more of a job for Tonya Harding? Galifianakis: (Healthcare.gov) That's the thing that doesn't work? Why would you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website? ‘Do you think a woman like Michelle would marry a nerd?’ Obama said. Galifianakis  followed up by asking to check with the First Lady himself, but that was quickly dismissed: ‘No I'm not going to let her near you,’ Obama said. The tone of the interview, which is set up like a poorly-funded public access program, was set from the very beginning as Galifianakis  apologized for having to cancel ‘a few times- my mousepad broke last week and I had to get my great aunt some diabetes shoes’. ‘I have to say when I heard that people actually watch this show I was pretty surprised,’ Obama said. A text scroll then introduced the President to viewers as ‘Barack Obama (SP?) Community Organizer’. The . majority of the 6-minute short was a series of barbs between the two . men, with the President criticizing Galifianakis ’ weight and his . ‘insecurities’ around his Hangover co-star Bradley Cooper. ‘First question: In 2013, you pardoned a turkey. What do you have planned for 2014?’ Galifianakis  asked. ‘We'll . probably pardon another turkey. We do that every Thanksgiving. Was that . depressing to you? One turkey taken out of circulation- one turkey you . couldn't eat?’ Obama said. When . Galifianakis  said that he must be upset that his second term is nearly . over, the President turned the issue around on the comedian. Smirk: Obama went on the program in an effort to promote the Affordable Care Act to the young audience . ‘If I ran a third time it'd sorta be like doing a third Hangover movie- didn't really work out, did it?’ he said. It wasn’t a one-sided war of words, however, as Galifianakis  brought his trademark abrasive persona. ‘So how does this work? Do you send . Ambassador Rodman to North Korea on your behalf? I read somewhere that . you would be sending Hulk Hogan to Syria- or is that more of a job for . Tonya Harding?’ he said. ‘Where are you planning on building your presidential library- in Hawaii or in your home country of Kenya?’ Later . when Obama began talking about the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, . Galifianakis  interrupted him by saying: ‘Is this what they mean by . drones?’ ‘(Healthcare.gov) That's the thing that doesn't work? Why would you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website?’ The big reveal: At the end, the President pushed the red button and the backdrop fell to the ground showing that they were in the Diplomatic Room of the White House . The skit ended when Obama pressed the red button that was a seemingly random addition to the set, and the black backdrop subsequently fell to the ground, revealing that the short was being filmed in the White House Diplomatic Room. Galifianakis  said that he had been filming in the White House since the Bush administration. Funny Or Die is run by Adam McKay and Will Farrell, who has appeared in videos promoting healthy eating with Mrs Obama. Galifianakis has only one record of making a political donation, and that went to North Carolina Senator Kay Hagan, a Democrat.","President Obama went on the satirical show to encourage younger viewers to sign up for the Affordable Care Act .

A new study starkly contradicts Left-wing claims that immigration helps to cut taxes . But MigrationWatch says it was based on ‘highly misleading’ claims and some ‘wholly unrealistic’ assumptions. It says authors Christian Dustmann and Tommaso Frattini, researchers at University College London, overstated the likely tax revenues from migrants and under-played the amount they claimed in benefits. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: ‘Our report finally disposes of the immigration lobby’s oft repeated claims that immigration reduces our tax burden. 'The total cost is high and increased dramatically between 1995 and 2011, providing no compensation for the overcrowding of this island which we are experiencing, largely as a result of immigration.’ 'The study by UCL’s Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration suggested that migrants contributed 34 per cent more in taxes than they cost in benefits and consumption of public services. But the MigrationWatch researchers point out that buried in a table at the back of the report, the net fiscal cost of migrants between 1995 and 2011 – the full span of the study – is revealed to be £95billion. But the UCL report used a much shorter period between 2001 and 2011, when Britain saw a huge influx of Eastern Europeans, to conclude migrants had made a net contribution of £25billion. The figures were based on the assumption that the most recent arrivals contribute as much as long term migrants, despite being younger and on lower incomes. It also assumed they paid the same amount of council tax and that foreign workers in agriculture and construction were paying the same in income tax as lawyers and accountants. It assumed migrants were taking no more in means-tested benefits than the rest of the population, and they received no more in housing benefit than the UK average. Using the same methodology as the UCL report but its own adjusted assumptions, MigrationWatch found that migrants in the period 2001-11 would have actually cost the Exchequer some £25billion. Over the longer period, from 1995 to 2011, they cost more than £140billion. The MigrationWatch study is the second to put a major question mark over the UCL research. Earlier this year Mervyn Stone, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at UCL, said the study was ‘obviously driven to make the case it claims to have made’. Professor Dustmann was one of the academics behind the prediction that only 13,000 migrants from Eastern Europe would come after controls were dropped in 2004. In the event, more than one million arrived in almost a decade. Last night he said: ‘The main criticisms by MigrationWatch relate to three points. 'The first and second points are unfortunately based on a serious misinterpretation of the methodology we have used in our work, which leads to fundamental mistakes that invalidate their calculations. ‘The third point has been already raised by other commentators in the past. We have responded to that point in much detail and show that it does not affect the basic conclusions of our paper.’","Migrants have cost Exchequer £140billion since the mid-1990s, it is claimed .

Perched on the edge of a sofa, drink in one hand and a canape in the other, I tried to make conversation with my blind date. As party-goers cavorted around us, I asked the nice man in the dinner suit about his job, then told him about my horses, before throwing in a couple of political firelighters to see if I could spark a good conversation into life. But we just didn't seem to be getting anywhere. Eventually, we gave up talking and sat staring into space as our friends grew merry on champagne and danced around the living room. Speaking out for the single ladies: Melissa Kite, left, is glad Jennifer Aniston defended a woman's right to remain single and childless . The 'date' was the result of a well-meaning friend insisting that I should not be alone as I saw in the New Year. 'No, no, I've found you a man,' she said, uttering the most terrifying words in the English language. She reminded me a friend of ours had a son who was recently separated and so would accompany me to a black-tie house party. I insisted I was happy to stay in alone with the dog and watch TV. She didn't believe me. No one ever does. It's that word 'happy' everyone gets stuck on. For society has a blindspot when it comes to women like me. How can I be happy when I am 42, without a man and childless? They see me as a problem to be fixed, a conundrum to unravel. No one can rest until I'm sorted. That is why I felt a surge of empathy when Jennifer Aniston hit out at the ongoing public fascination with her personal life. Romance in the spotlight: Now with Justin Theroux, Jennifer has faced constant speculation about her love life over the years . The Hollywood actress spoke for happily unmarried women everywhere when she railed against society's obsession with the traditional happy ending. This fixation has dogged Miss Aniston, 45, more than any other celebrity I can think of. She must get sick of people speculating whether she is going to get married and why she hasn't. And the endless guessing about whether or not she is pregnant must drive her mad. I have often thought how unfair this is. A gorgeous, witty, self-made woman, Miss Aniston ought to be inviting widespread admiration for her achievements. Women who remain childless and single, whether by accident or design, belong to the fastest growing demographic of our age . Yet instead of lauding her accomplishments as a popular comic actress, the world continually asks when she is going to marry whoever she is dating - currently actor Justin Theroux. As she pointed out, when she poked fun at the ongoing speculation at a recent women's conference in the U.S., the assumption is that women are unfulfilled unless they have married and given birth. 'Being a woman, our value and worth is basically associated with our marital status or whether or not we have procreated,' she told feminist and activist Gloria Steinem at the makers Conference on women’s issues in California. She joked that people assumed single, childless women were 'in fact in deep s**t'. What she means to highlight, of course, is that the exact opposite is the case. That she even has to point this out is astonishing in this day and age. Women who remain childless and single, whether by accident or design, belong to the fastest growing demographic of our age. Didn't work out: Like the actress, who was married to Brad Pitt, Melissa's relationship in her 30s did not last . But, as Miss Aniston has found, and in my experience, too, we may as well still be in the Dark Ages. As a single woman, I often find myself the subject of people's pity and, sometimes, their suspicion. No one, not even my closest friends, seems able to believe I am happy in my unattached state. When I tell them I don't want to meet a man, they give me a look that says they think I am bravely whistling in the dark. 'Bless her heart,' their concerned faces say. Anyone would think I was a spinster in a Jane Austen novel who will be destitute unless I can find a man to marry me . They show ill-disguised disbelief when I assert that I do not want children any more. And because I am in my 40s, they leave me in no doubt that though they are doing their best to fix me up, it is a tough ask. I have been variously told by my matchmaker friends: 'I know a guy whose wife has just left him and he can't cope on his own... My husband has a friend who's just got divorced from a woman who beat him black and blue ... ' And my all-time favourite: 'There's a guy living on a houseboat near us who seems like a real oddball. He'd be perfect for you.' Honestly, anyone would think I was a spinster in a Jane Austen novel who will be destitute unless I can find a man to marry me. As for the gossip single women endure, I often feel as if I've woken up in 1692 in Salem, Massachusetts, during the witch trials. A few weeks ago, I went for dinner with a male friend, a divorced farmer. Days later, a friend called me: 'The word going round is that you and the farmer are an item!' Fancy free: The writer says you don't need a man to be happy . 'Can't a woman have dinner with a male friend on a Friday night?' I asked. Obviously not. Last month, I went to a big formal dinner. As I arrived, one of the guests, there with his wife, greeted me, then looked behind me and said: 'Who are you with?' 'No one,' I said. 'But who did you come with?' he asked, frowning. 'I came with myself,' I said, walking into the venue alone, as he stared at me as if I had walked in naked. There is something about a woman alone that still scandalises polite society. Though we like to think of ourselves as advanced, we still see women as the weaker sex, in need of male support. Even the term 'fix you up' implies there is something to put right, that single women are broken and need mending. Yes, there has been sadness in my life and romantic disappointment. Did I set out to be on my own in my 40s? Probably not. It has happened, in large part, because I spent my mid-30s with a man who did not want to settle down and have children. I don't know the real story of Miss Aniston's marriage to Brad Pitt - when she was aged 30 to 35 - but I'm guessing there may be similarities to my situation. I met the man I thought was the love of my life, a City broker called Ed, when I was 34, and spent three turbulent years trying to persuade him to start a family. He was dead set against it, but I stayed with him because I was in love. By the time I accepted he was never going to agree to children, I was nearly 38. The child-bearing years of my life were almost gone. I spent a year getting over him and, by the time I was ready for another relationship, I was pushing 40 and getting pregnant was a whole different game. I could have tried, at 38, to have a baby on my own with fertility treatment. At 40, when I did meet someone else, I could have tried to start a family with him. But I am a great believer in accepting when a ship has sailed. I didn't feel it was right to immediately demand marriage and children of my most recent boyfriend, Will. I would rather enjoy what I have than hanker after what I don't. No point regretting what might have been: Melissa, pictured age 15, didn't plan to be unmarried in her 40s . Will and I split up last year, but remain firm friends. Even though the romance didn't work, we will always be there for each other. For me, the formal arrangement of a marriage just wasn't meant to be. Instead of a husband and children, I find fulfilment looking after my horses and spaniel pup. Rather than regret what might have been, I make a virtue of the fact I am footloose and fancy free. I accept that a lot of the concern is well-meaning. Just as my friends worry for me, Miss Aniston's fans fret about her finding a man who will look after her because they feel genuine affection for her. But I also believe the reason so many women identify with the former Friends star is precisely because she is unmarried, childless and, by her insistence, happy. Perhaps our obsession with the romantic happy ending is evolving. The more we happily unmarrieds go on being happy, and defying expectations, the more likely it is we will change perceptions. When I was writing my last book, the publisher asked me if the main character would end up with the man of her dreams. Because it was a memoir based on my life, my publisher joked how brilliant it would be if I found a man, and a happy ending for the book, while I was writing it. I made the ending of the book suitably ambiguous. I am working on a novel and, again, find myself grappling with the same question. Will my heroine live happily ever after because she finds a man? Or will she live happily ever after, even though she doesn't? I would like to think she is strong enough to find happiness either way.

George Osborne is preparing to face down demands to increase the 40p tax rate which has hit an extra 1million workers since the coalition was formed. The Chancellor is under growing pressure to stop dragging more middle-class earners into the tax bracket which was once targeted at the wealthy. Workers now get hit with the 40p rate when they earn £41,450 a year. But with a rise to £44,000 costing the Treasury £1.5billion, Mr Osborne is expected to instead to turn focus his focus on lower earners in next week's Budget. By freezing or lowering the 40p tax rate, the number of earners caught in the bracket has risen to 4.4million under the coalition . Chancellor George Osborne is expected to focus his attention on low earners in next week's Budget . The flagship Lib Dem tax policy has been to increase the amount workers can earn before paying income tax at all, and will reach £10,000 in April this year. But to help pay for it, Mr Osborne has frozen or lowered the point at which workers start paying the 40p rate. In 2010 when the coalition was formed there were 3.02million people earning more than the £43,875 threshold where they started paying the higher tax rate. But this year the threshold has fallen to £41,450, which means 4.4million now pay the 40p rate.  In 1988 just 1.35million was paying that rate. Critics say the higher rate is no longer . faced only by the ‘highly paid few’ but hitting middle earners like . teachers, nurses and small businesses. The national minimum wage is to increase by 19p an hour to £6.50 later this year, giving more than a million workers a pay rise. The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour - a 2 per cent increase. For 16 and 17-year-olds the statutory rate will rise by 7p to GBP3.79, also 2 per cent. The minimum wage for apprentices will go up by 5p to £2.73 an hour, with all the new rates coming into force in October. The Government said it had accepted recommendations from the low Pay Commission, including plans for bigger increases in future than in recent years. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'The recommendations I have accepted today mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take home pay since 2008. 'This will benefit over one million workers on national minimum wage and marks the start of a welcome new phase in minimum wage policy.' With the Lib Dem policy implemented in full, and another £500 rise in the income tax threshold to £10,500 expected in next week’s Budget, Tory pressure has mounted for action to help middle earners. Conservatives say the time has come for Mr Osborne to do something for the ‘squeezed middle’ earning between £40,000 and £60,000 . Nick de Bois said: ‘Paying 40 pence to the government of every pound earned over the present threshold of £41,450 is at best demoralising. At worst, it can kill ambition and undermine aspiration. ‘The number of workers paying the higher 40p tax rate is expected to rise from 4.4 million this year to more than 6 million in 2015 because the threshold rate will not increase in line with inflation.’ John Redwood told The Times: ‘It is affecting not just those at the threshold limit, who find that a payrise disappears, but people further down the income scale with aspirations. We need lower taxes across the board.’ However, the Treasury insists that anyone earning less than £100,000 has benefited at least in part from the increase in the income tax threshold to £10,000, although basic rate payers have saved most – worth £700-a-year. A spokesman said: 'The government believes the most effective way to support those on low and middle incomes, and to help them to be more financially secure, is to enable them to keep more of the money they earn. 'That is why we have taken significant steps to increase the personal allowance – the amount an individual can earn before paying income tax. 'Although these increases have been targeted at low and middle income earners, higher rate taxpayers have also benefited. 'As a result, a typical higher rate taxpayer will be around £56 better of this year than under inherited plans.' Increases in the threshold at which workers start paying tax mean the number of basic rate taxpayers has fallen by almost 3million since 2010 . Senior Tories say they have been told Mr Osborne will not act on the 40p rate because of the huge costs involved. Meanwhile, Mr Osborne is facing calls to use any spare cash to offer a £5.4 billion National Insurance break for businesses. Right-leaning think-tank Policy Exchange argues the move would provide an incentive to boost jobs, pay and productivity and save firms £250 for each worker they employ. It urged the Chancellor to focus on increasing the 2015/16 employer NI threshold to £192 per week, the equivalent of £10,000 per year, instead of changes to income tax.","Chancellor faces calls from Tory MPs to offer help for middle earners .

A jealous husband was jailed for life today for murdering his 'Shirley Valentine' wife over her holiday romance. Mother-of-four Assia Newton, 44, was strangled by her furious husband Kelvin, 45, for falling in love with a waiter on a Mediterranean holiday. After years trapped in an unhappy marriage, she told her builder husband that she wanted a divorce – and had met a new man in Tunisia. Jealous: Assia Newton (left)  was murdered by her builder husband, Kelvin (right) at the family home in South Wales after she fell in love with a Tunisian waiter during a Mediterranean holiday . Mrs Newton was due to fly out to meet the waiter for a third holiday in two months when Newton strangled her with a dog lead in the bedroom of the family home. The couple’s three daughters looked down on their father from the public gallery as he was jailed for life with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 18 years. Youngest daughter Sameera, 17, said: ‘‘Mum joked she was like Shirley Valentine and told dad about the waiter after the second holiday.’ Victim: Assia Newton poses for a happy family portrait with her three daughters. Mrs Newton's smiles belied the fact that her home life with her husband was a continuous series of arguments and violent rows . The daughters told police how their father had ‘changed’ after being told about Mrs Newton’s new relationship with a waiter called Mohammed. Cardiff Crown Court heard that Mrs Newton visited Tunisia for the first time in June last year after going on holiday with her daughter Sophia to celebrate the girl's 18th birthday. Mrs Newton returned to Tunisia alone a fortnight later and began a long-distance relationship with daily calls to Mohammed over the internet. She was days away from taking her third holiday to meet her new love when Newton strangled her with a dog lead. Eldest daughter Charmaine, 23, said that her mother was ‘happy’ someone was being kind to her after suffering years of violence in her 23-year marriage. She said her father had been ‘violent, controlling and jealous’ throughout the marriage. Charmaine added that her mother had begun to ‘stand up for herself’ in the months before her death. Newton, of Bridgend, denied murder but was found guilty by a jury after a two-week trial. Her Honour Judge Eleri Rees told him: ‘This was murder borne out of your sexual jealousy and the knowledge that Assia intended to leave you for good. ‘Assia told friends that there was no sexual relationship but she believed it could develop into one.‘She even had the courage to tell you about the relationship. ‘But it is clear you didn’t take the news calmly and did not accept the marriage was over.’ Judge Rees said: ‘‘Assia will never see her daughters marry and become mothers themselves. No sentence I can pass will heal the pain and anguish they feel.’ She sentenced Newton to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 18 years before he can be considered for release.","Mother-of-four strangled by husband with a dog lead in bedroom at Pencoed, near Bridgend, South Wales .

Kyle Trevor allegedly killed three adults and the girl over a two-week period in late April and early May. He is on trial for capital murder in the killings of 21-year-old Kaylie Bailey and her daughter Lana-Leigh Bailey, according to the Kansas City Star. He is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of housemates Andrew Stout, 30, and Steven E. White, 31. Scroll down for video . Kyle Flack is led from the detention center to the Franklin County Courthouse in Ottawa on Tuesday, March 11, 2014. Flack is charged with killing four people . Flack, 28, has been charged with capital murder, first-degree murder and attempted rape in the killings last May . The bodies of Andrew Stout, Steven White and Kaylie Bailey were discovered at Stout's farm in Ottawa, about 50 miles southwest of Kansas City . He also is charged with the attempted rape of Kaylie Bailey, who was found partially nude, and with being a felon in possession of a firearm. The day of his arrest, Flack first told officers he’d heard something had happened to a friend, and he asked if the officers could tell him what, according to testimony. Later in the day, during 10 hours of questioning spread over two sessions, Flack allegedly spilled out how at least one of the deaths occurred. According to testimony from Franklin County Sheriff’s Deputy Jeremi Thompson, Flack said Stout had confronted White about rent money he owed and had ordered White to move out. Stout followed White outside carrying a shotgun. He shot White then handed the shotgun to Flack, who fired another shot. 'I shot him. He dies,' Thompson quoted Flack as saying. Before the preliminary hearing started, Franklin County District Judge Thomas Sachse ruled that prosecutors could introduce Flack’s statement into evidence. Murdered: Kaylie Bailey (right) was found dead . at the Ottawa, Kansas-area farm where she had gone to drop off . her daughter Lana (left). The little guy was found some days later inside a suitcase thrown into a creek . But Deputy Kansas Attorney General Victor Braden said prosecutors only intended to use the portion concerning White’s death. Authorities previously have said that White was killed between April 20 and April 29, and Stout was killed April 29. The rape attempt on Bailey allegedly happened May 1, the day she and her daughter were killed, they have said. Stout’s boss testified that he didn’t show up for work April 29. A friend who went by Stout’s house that day said Flack was the only one there and told him that Stout had left to run errands. Bailey’s mother, Lisa Smith, testified that she last saw her daughter and granddaughter the morning of May 1 at her Olathe home. Bailey was planning to go to Stout’s house, her mother testified. A friend of Flack’s testified that Flack called him May 3 before coming to the friend’s Emporia home. Dramatic difference: Kyle Flack is led from the detention center to the Franklin County Courthouse in May 2013. Almost one year later, he looks dramatically different . Kyle Flack is seen here shortly after his arrest in May 2013 . Concerned friends of Stout called police to the farm twice before authorities finally found the bodies May 6. By then, the bodies were significantly decomposed, according to testimony. A tarp and cinder blocks covered White’s body in a detached garage, investigators testified. He had been shot once in the head and once in the chest. Investigators found the bodies of Stout and Bailey inside the home’s master bedroom, beneath a pile of clothes. Bailey was found naked from the waist down, a red bandana tied around her neck and her arms held behind her by a black zip tie. She had what appeared to be a gunshot wound to her head, investigators testified. Authorities found Bailey’s purse in a laundry basket in the bedroom, and they found a child’s car seat in the garage. Several spent shotgun shells littered the bedroom. On alert: Riders on horseback searched culverts . and drainage ditches along a Kansas Highway 68 for 18-month-old . Lana-Leigh Bailey. Some 150 were involved in the search operation last year . One shell was found in the garage and another in a trash can. Police spotted Bailey’s car in Emporia before arresting Flack at the friend’s apartment, where they also found a duffle bag that reportedly belonged to Flack. Among its contents were black zip ties. Three days later, searchers found a small child’s body inside suitcase in a creek near Stubbs Road, just across the Franklin County line into Osage County. Sheets of paper scattered along the creek bank bore the names of Bailey and her daughter. Searchers also found diapers dumped there.

Researchers found that by forbidding a pleasure - such as a bar of chocolate -  it heightened the brain’s awareness of it. But they also found that people did not become fixated if they knew that other people were not able to enjoy their favourite thing. Envious: The more we forbid an object - such as a specific food - the more our brain becomes focussed on it. Lead author Grace Truong of the University of British Columbia said: ‘Our findings show that when individuals are forbidden from everyday objects, our minds and brains pay more attention to them. ‘Our brains give forbidden objects the same level of attention as our own personal possessions.’ The study's most important finding, though, is that obsession is not as strong if others are also denied: when an object is forbidden to a group, the allure of the object reduces dramatically. Scientists say that this helps to explain why group diet techniques such as Weight Watchers can be more successful than dieting alone. Temptation: Scientists have discovered why dieting is so difficult . It also offers important insights for compulsive hoarding and parents seeking to help their children's attachment to toys and other possessions. For the study, entitled An unforgettable apple: Memory and attention for forbidden objects, participants were shown images of everyday objects and told the objects were either theirs, someone else's, forbidden to them or forbidden to everyone. Using electronic brain imaging and memory tests, researchers found the forbidden objects were recognised as well as self-owned objects. This was interpreted as a sign of unnecessary heightened concentration. ‘Since the days of Eve and the apple, scholars have been interested in [mankind's] attraction to items we should avoid,’ says Professor Todd Handy who also took part in the study. ‘Today, it is things like jumbo soft drinks, fatty foods and illicit substances. ‘These new findings help to explain how our brain processes forbidden objects and suggests that, for resisting temptation, there's strength in numbers. It's harder to go it alone.’ The findings are published in the journal Cognitive, Affective and Behavioral Neuroscience .","U.S. experts found that the more we try to ignore an object, the more our brain concentrates on it .

For centuries the city has been preserved under layers of volcanic ash after an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D., which killed thousands of people. However, now the Unesco world heritage site, visited by 2.5million people every year and is one of Italy's most popular attractions, faces a new threat - from the weather.

Journalist Nils Horner was shot dead while he was talking to a translator on a street in an affluent area of the Afghanistan capital . An extremist Taliban splinter group has claimed responsibility for killing a Swedish-British journalist in Kabul saying he was killed he was a spy for Britain's MI-6 agency. Nils Horner had worked for Swedish Radio SR since 2001 as a foreign correspondent mostly in Asia and the Middle East, including Afghanistan and Baghdad. The 51-year-old was killed by a shot in the head as he was reporting on Afghanistan's election on a street in Kabul on Tuesday. It was a rare assassination of a foreigner in the capital and raised fears of increased violence ahead of the April 5 presidential election. The Feday-e-Mahaz says in a statement posted Wednesday on its website that it targeted Horner because he was a spy and not a journalist. The group was created by loyalists of slain Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah. The group broke with the Taliban following the announcement of talks with the United States. A . guard at a restaurant across the street from where the attack happened . said two young men approached the journalist as he was talking to his . translator at about 11 a.m. on the side of the road . The . guard, Mohammad Zubair, said one of the men pulled out a pistol and . shot Horner in the head, causing him to collapse in a pool of blood. He . said there was a single shot and the bullet then hit a nearby car, which . was left with a bullet hole. The witness said he and other guards called to the police at a nearby checkpoint and they cordoned off the area. Scene: Mr Horner was shot in the affluent Wazir Akbar Khan district (pictured) of Kabul, which is home to several embassies and media organisations . The . attack came two months after the Islamic militant movement staged . a suicide bombing and shooting assault against a Lebanese restaurant . that killed 13 foreigners and eight Afghans in the same area. Suicide . bombings and other attacks are frequent in Kabul and elsewhere in . Afghanistan as insurgents fight to undermine confidence in the . Western-backed government. But assassinations of journalists and other foreigners in the capital are relatively rare. Mr Horner had worked for Swedish Radio SR since 2001 as a foreign correspondent mostly in Asia and the Middle East . Not . including Horner, at least 29 journalists have been killed in . Afghanistan since 1992, most of them after the 2001 U.S.-led ouster of . the Taliban, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect . Journalists. Sayed Gul . Agha Hashimi, the head of the Kabul Criminal Investigation Department, . said police were questioning the journalist's driver and translator as . part of the investigation. Hashimi said the journalist died while being treated at the hospital. Swedish Embassy counselor Christian Nilsson said the body had been transported to the morgue. Anne Lagercrantz, head of news at Swedish Radio, said the newsroom was in deep shock. She said Horner spoke to the desk in Stockholm early on Tuesday and they agreed that he would go out and do interviews ahead of the April 5 presidential election. When people in the newsroom saw reports that a foreign journalist had been shot in Kabul, they tried to contact Horner by email but got no response. They then called his mobile phone, and a doctor answered saying Horner had been shot and killed, Lagercrantz said. Swedish Radio chief executive Cilla Benko said two men approached Horner and shot him in the back of his head. Benko said Horner was very safety conscious but was prepared to take risks. 'This was his life,' Benko said. 'He didn't want to do anything else.' Swedish Radio officials said there were no known threats to Horner. The attack came as security in the capital was tight amid fears of violence in connection with the funeral of Afghanistan's powerful Vice President Mohammed Qasim Fahim.","Nils Horner, 51, was shot in the head at close range in Akbar Khan .

A drug used to treat diabetes could cut the risk of developing dementia by 20 per cent, a study has found. Almost 15,000 people aged over 55 diagnosed with the type 2 form of the disease were given the drug metformin over five years. But when scientists looked back over medical records they found it also reduced the chances of those with diabetes developing dementia. Drug aid: Diabetes type 2 patients who had been treated with metformin ran a 20 per cent lesser risk of developing dementia in old age . Metformin, one of the most common diabetes treatments, makes the body more sensitive to insulin, which diabetes sufferers cannot naturally produce. About 800,000 people in the UK suffer from a form of dementia, with more than half being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Jess Smith of the Alzheimer’s Society in the UK said: ‘Diabetes sufferers are twice as likely to develop dementia than those who don’t have the disease anyway so this is positive news but only time will tell. ‘At the moment it’s still early days and we are not sure exactly how metformin works with regard to dementia. ‘But what is becoming increasingly apparent is the role of insulin in the brain and the way it can regulate the brains behaviour.’ Cause: Diabetes type 2 is a is a metabolic disorder which mainly occurs in people over 40 who are overweight, and is treated with medication and diet . Clinical trials are now underway to establish the use of metformin as a therapy for both dementia and mild cognitive impairment, which is thought could be a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. The study by scientists at non-profit medical group Kaiser Permanante, based in California, presented their findings at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Boston in the US yesterday. An Alzheimer’s Society spokesman welcomed the research and said: ‘The more we learn about dementia and how it relates to other conditions like diabetes, the more we’re able to explore whether existing drugs can double as dementia treatments. ‘This study suggests that the drug metaformin may be one of the most promising candidates to do just that. ‘One in three people over the age of 65 will develop dementia. Given the huge cost and high profile failures of developing new treatments from scratch, looking at ways to use drugs like this to treat dementia is incredibly important.’ Experts predict dementia sufferers in the UK will rise to 1million in less than ten years and could soar to 1.7 million by 2051.","Metformin found to lessen risk of dementia in diabetes type 2 patients .

A 20-year-old hairdresser from a New York suburb has two Good Samaritans to thank for pulling her to safety from the burning wreckage of her car following a horrific crash over the weekend. Alyssa Fox was driving home to Seaford at around 2am Saturday when she veered off Route 347 in Smithtown and slammed into a tree. Her car immediately burst into flames. As her parents later described in a touching letter addressed to her rescuers, their daughter was lying badly injured and disoriented inside a burning car flipped on its side when she heard a voice from the outside and saw a shadow. Scroll down for video . Emotional reunion: Matthew Monahan, took a break from his duties as a nursing assistant in the ER at Stony Brook University Hospital on Tuesday, to visit 20-year-old Alyssa Fox, in the hospital room where she is recovering from her injuries from an accident last weekend . Hugs and tears: Fox tearfully said that if it were not for her two 'guardian angels,' she would have died in her car because she was too injured to escape on her own . Matthew Monahan, 25, a volunteer firefighter and nursing assistant at Stony Brook University Hospital, noticed the burning car and rushed over to see if he could help. Joseph Moscato, a Long Island Rail Road engineer and former firefighter and paramedic, was also driving in the area after finishing his shift and pulled over. Working together, the two complete strangers armed with a single fire extinguisher were able to tame the flames just long enough for Monahan to pull the severely injured Fox out of the managed vehicle. Just 30 seconds later, the 2006 Dodge Sedan turned into a fireball. The young hair stylist from Seaford suffered a broken spine, fractured several ribs, her clavicle, a leg and one of her wrists. Fiery crash: Miss Fox was driving home Saturday on Route 347 in Smithtown when she became distracted by her GPS and slammed into a tree, sparking a fire . Kindness of strangers: While Fox lay with a broken spine in the overturned burning car, she heard the voices of two motorists who pulled over and rushed to her aid . Life savers: Monahan, a nursing assistant and firefighter (left) pulled Fox to safety with the help of LIRR engineer Joseph Moscato, who bought him about 30 seconds by spraying the flames with his fire extinguisher . On Tuesday, Miss Fox, who has been undergoing treatment at Stony Brook University Hospital since Saturday, had a tearful reunion with the two men whom she now calls her 'guardian angels.' 'I just remember sitting in the car and screaming for my life, like, “You need to get me out of here!”' Fox recalled to CBS2 from her hospital bed. ‘He [Monahan] got there five seconds later. Literally, someone was watching over me.’ The bedridden young victim with a brace on her neck explained that on the night of the accident, she briefly glanced at her GPS, and a moment later her car struck a tree near Veterans Memorial Highway and caught fire. Monahan, whose father is a 40-year veteran of the NYFD, reached the burning wreckage first and tried to break the windshield with his boots, but to no avail. He was soon joined by Moscato, whose dashboard camera recorded the pair's heroic efforts. At first, the LIRR worker tried to . use his fire extinguisher as a battering ram to crack the windshield. When that did not work, Moscato sprayed the intensifying flames, which . by then had spread to the interior of the car, with foam from his handheld extinguisher. His . split-second decision bought Monahan enough time to grab Fox and . extract her from the vehicle, which was consumed by the raging inferno . just seconds later. Laundry list of injuries: The blonde, 20-year-old hair stylist from Seaford suffered a broken spine, fractured ribs, clavicle, a leg and one of her wrists . True gratitude: Fox and her family said they were eternally grateful to the woman's rescuers for putting their lives at risk in order to save her from certain death . ‘There was a moment when I said to him I’m going to die tonight,’ Fox told WABC. ‘I’m not going to make it out. I’m going to die in here. He said, “I’m not leaving you behind. I’m getting you out of here.”’ Later, the young woman, who is now on a long road to recovery, called her rescue a ‘miracle’ and said that she would not be alive today without Moscato and Monahan. Alyssa’s father, Scott Fox, celebrated his 50th birthday Tuesday, calling his daughter’s rescue the best present a parent could get. ‘These guys are heroes, they are part of my family without a doubt,’ he told the New York Post. ‘I don’t know how I could ever repay these guys. Without them, it’d be a totally different story.’ On his part, Monahan has dismissed the notion that he was a hero, insisting that he was just doing his job. ‘People talk about rewards and things like that,’ the humble firefighter told the station WABC. ‘My reward is to look her in her face and see her smile at the end of the day, that's my reward.’","Alyssa Fox, 20, said she was 60 seconds from certain death when Matthew Monahan and Joseph Moscato pulled her out of her burning car .

Cheese helps reduce cavities forming in teeth because it neutralises plaque acid, according to a new study. Researchers found that the fermented dairy product made the mouth more alkaline, which in turn reduced the need for dental treatment. They also discovered that cheese created a protective film around teeth. Tuck in!: A U.S. study has finally given people an excuse to indulge in a cheese board. Cheddar raises the mouth's pH which reduces the risk of cavities . The higher the pH level (the more . alkaline) on the surface of teeth, the more teeth are protected against . dental erosion, which causes cavities and leads to fillings, . said the study. The research, carried out by the Academy of General Dentistry in the U.S., divided 68 children aged between 12 and 15 into three groups. One group was asked to consume a daily portion of cheddar, another a sugar-free yoghurt, and another a glass of milk, followed by a mouth . rinse. The pH levels on their dental plaque were measured both before the test and then ten minutes, 20 minutes and half an hour afterwards. Those who ate the yoghurt or drank the milk showed no changes to the pH levels in their mouths at any of the intervals, said lead researcher Vipul Yadav. But those who ate the cheese showed a 'rapid' increase in pH level at each of the time intervals. Cheese!: The dairy product was also found to create a protective film on teeth . The researchers believe that eating cheese increases the amount of saliva in the mouth which is the body's natural way of maintaining a healthy pH level. Added to this, cheese releases chemical compounds that can form a protective layer on teeth which further protects it against the acids that attack enamel. A spokesman for the research said: 'The groups who consumed milk and sugar-free yogurt experienced no changes in the pH levels in their mouths. 'Subjects who ate cheese, however, showed a rapid increase in pH levels at each time interval, suggesting that cheese has anti-cavity properties.' The results were published in the journal General Dentistry.","The U.S. Academy of General Dentistry found that eating cheese increased production of alkaline saliva .
